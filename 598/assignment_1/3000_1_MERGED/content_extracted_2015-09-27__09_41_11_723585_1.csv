(Credit: NASA.) It's been nearly 150 years since scientists first made efforts to forecast the arrival of tornadoes. But as indicated by this week's storm in Moore, Oklahoma — which killed 24 people and ravaged thousands of homes — they still can't anticipate these potentially deadly weather events with much time to spare. In Moore, residents only had 16 minutes notice that a tornado was forming. The first guide to tornado forecasting, published in 1888, set the basis for predicting the storms. But today, with new technology that offers a closer glimpse at weather conditions, the complexity of tornado forecasting is greater than ever. ""Tornadoes are predicted by looking at present and near-future conditions — including moisture and wind throughout the atmosphere"" explains James Elsner, PhD, a climate and weather researcher from Florida State University.  Meteorologists still have to rely on observations Data is collected from a number of sources — radar, observation stations, weather balloons, planes and satellites, and a network of 290,000 volunteer storm spotters — and then fed into vast mathematical simulations that churn out detailed local forecasts of what may happen in a few hours' time. While it's relatively easy to say that an area half the size of a state may experience tornadoes, pinning down exactly where a twister will touch down is a much tougher job, and can only be done on a timescale of minutes — computer simulations aren't yet reliable enough at the scale of an individual storm, so meteorologists still have to rely on observations. ""Tornadoes can form in different ways,"" says Elsner. The same conditions that spawn a tornado during one storm might not do so in another. Plus, once the conditions are finally right, the tornado is often down on the ground before anyone has time to react. ""They can form quickly and become violent in a matter of minutes,"" Elsner adds. Tornado-generating storms need very specific conditions to form — moisture, temperature, and something known as wind shear, where the wind changes in strength and direction with height. The atmosphere also needs to be ""unstable"" — a term that indicates that if you give a bubble of air a shove, it'll accelerate upward. When you have those ingredients, the stage is set for the development of a thunderstorm that rotates, known as a supercell. Plenty of supercells never spawn a tornado Even when all those factors align, the chances of a tornado hitting the ground are very small. The number of strong, violent tornadoes that occur in a 10,000 square mile area, per year, is 0.1 across the entire US, and only 0.6 in Tennessee, the state with the highest frequency. In other words, plenty of supercells never spawn a tornado, as many a disgruntled stormchaser will tell you. The average time between a tornado warning being issued and a twister touching down has been refined from 5 minutes to 13 minutes over the last couple of decades. It's an improvement, but hardly adequate to keep everyone in a tornado's path safe from harm. NOAA image from four-dimensional storm sell investigator. (Credit: NOAA.) But new techniques to ameliorate that timeframe are on the way. In 2007, meteorologists at the US government's National Severe Storm Laboratory (NSSL) developed a prototype, called the four-dimensional storm cell investigator. This radar can create and manipulate dynamic, 3D cross-sections, so that meteorologists can ""slice and dice"" storms and view that data from multiple angles and across time. ""Scanning up and down with our radar helps,"" says Elsner. By looking at that structure, it's also possible to see common tornado signatures signatures, like the ""hook echo"" — a hook-shaped feature that indicates tornadogenesis. A debris ball signature can verify tornadoes with 70 to 80 percent accuracy This new radar has also helped forecasters establish more accurate tornado signatures, like the ""debris ball,"" wherein material being carried in the vortex of a tornado can be spotted before the storm touches down. A debris ball signature can verify tornadoes with 70 to 80 percent accuracy. The four-dimensional storm cell investigator is still being tweaked and improved, but it's hoped that the technology will roll out to more radar stations across the US in the coming decade. NOAA image of a debris ball in a storm. (Credit: NOAA.) In addition to better radar, other investigators are working on more sophisticated computer modeling systems — capable of incorporating an unpredictable melee of variables into accurate predictions. ""There's pressure, there's temperature, and none of the radars and current sensing instruments can get that at the resolution we really need to fundamentally understand the tornadoes,"" project leader Amy McGovern, PhD, a meteorologist at the University of Oklahoma, told Science Nation earlier this year. Her computer models include these variables, giving meteorologists new opportunities to spot signatures that indicate the formation of a tornado — and potentially warn of tornadoes much sooner. This approach is being extensively tested by the research meteorologists at the NSSL, who are keen to get their hands on as many new tools as they can for their forecasting arsenal. Right now it's pumping out much more data than the forecasters need, so getting it to show the usable information and hide the junk is the next important step. None of this burgeoning technology is foolproof Unfortunately, none of this burgeoning technology is foolproof. Modeling storm systems is a promising technique, but because storms are incredibly sensitive to tiny changes, using a model — rather than observations — means that forecasters will inevitably lose accuracy. It's these tiny changes that tip a storm between forming a tornado or not, making McGovern and co.'s job incredibly difficult. NOAA photo of a 2008 Oklahoma tornado. (Credit: Sean Waugh NOAA/NSSL.) Piling on the pressure is the fact that false positives can do a tremendous amount of harm to residents' confidence in forecasts. Even when urgent warnings are issued, many people don't immediately seek shelter — sometimes because they don't have one, but often because they ignore sirens. ""A lot of times people don't react until they see it."" ""We'd like to think that as soon as we say there is a tornado warning, everyone would run to the basement,"" Ken Harding, a weather service official in Kansas City, told the Huffington Post last year. ""That's not how it is. They will channel flip, look out the window or call neighbours. A lot of times people don't react until they see it."" To address that problem, meteorologists are experimenting with issuing new warnings in Kansas and Missouri that use words like  ""mass devastation,"" ""unsurvivable"" and ""catastrophic"" to get people to pay attention. Two tiers of warnings for thunderstorms and three tiers for tornadoes have been created, based on severity. It's hoped that this might give people more context on the level of the danger that the storm poses, making them less likely to ignore it. More accurate, effective forecasts being issued further in advance If these techniques — improved radar analysis, better computer models and refined warnings — can be combined, we should see more accurate, effective forecasts being issued further in advance. And that might very well be increasingly important: no long-term trends have yet been established that indicate more tornadoes in the years to come, but Elsner suspects that tornado tracks, at least, are getting longer and wider.

These are just three of scientists' choices for a new top ten list of newly discovered animals, plants, and microbes from 2012. Now in it's sixth year, the list is put together by an international committee of experts selected by the International Institute for Species Exploration at Arizona State University. The light-producing cockroach, Lucihormetica luckae, is extraordinary for a number of different reasons. Not only is it one of a rare number of land-based animals to demonstrate luminescence, it may also already be extinct. The only known specimen was discovered more than 70 years ago. In a more modern twist, a lacewing (a relative of butterflies) made it to the list after a photo of the insect was spotted on a Malaysian man's Flickr account and identified as a new species by a Californian entomologist. One new species was discovered on Flickr  Also fighting for a place in the top 10 is a snail-eating false coral snake, hanging flies that mimicked tree leaves more than 165 million years ago, rare flowering bushes from a forest in Madagascar, and a tiny violet. Completing the list is a new species of monkey that has human-like eyes and a blue bottom and a black fungus which is causing damage to Paleolithic paintings in the Lascaux Cave in France. IISE founding director Quentin Wheeler believes the scientific community has only discovered 20 percent of earth's living species and is calling for a NASA-like mission to discover 10 million species in the next 50 years.

It's the fourth time since 1956 that locals have rejected plans to fluoridate city drinking water — and makes Portland the only city among the 30 largest in the US to remain without fluoridated water.  The vote, which was held using mail-in ballots and wrapped up on Tuesday night, highlights the contentious nature of fluoridation — by now a mainstay across the US — in Portland. Since the 1950's, when major metropolitan areas started adding fluoride to their water supplies in an effort to bolster dental health, Portland residents have consistently bunked measures to follow suit. Allegations of corruption and sham science But in September of last year, Portland's city council quietly, and unanimously, elected to fluoridate the city's water starting in 2014. The move sparked outcry among anti-fluoride advocacy groups, including Clean Water Portland, who gathered 43,000 signatures to force a referendum on the measure. From there, organizations on both sides of the debate raised hundreds of thousands of dollars and launched aggressive campaigns: lawn signs, telephone push polls and boisterous rallies, along with allegations of corruption and sham science, turned the debate into ""the city's most contentious of the 21st century."" ""We don't want more chemicals in our water."" ""At a very fundamental level, people understand that we don't want more chemicals in our water,"" Kim Kaminsky, leader of Clean Water Portland, told the Portland Tribune. The group and its anti-fluoride cohort claim that fluoridation constitutes the unlawful medication of citizens, threatens to damage water supplies, and might be harmful to human health. Decades of scientific research, however, doesn't align with those ideas. As Slate points out in a comprehensive report, ""almost every credible national, state, and local health and science organization-private and public-gives its blessing to optimal levels of water fluoridation.""

The goal is to make them more reflective at night, and easier for drivers to see. But the main government instruction manual for doing so, the longtime bible of roadside signage and safety, could soon be chopped in half. Advocates worry the change will cause confusion for drivers and increase the risk of accidents. ""The idea of dividing the baby and only keeping the parts that are mandated is, we think, shortsighted,"" said Henry Jasny, vice president and general counsel for the Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety, a lobbying group made of up of insurance organizations and consumer rights' proponents.  ""dividing the baby and only keeping the parts that are mandated."" Jasny told The Verge that his group is concerned about a government proposal, announced in early 2013, to cut the federal Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) into two documents — one containing all the standards required by law, and another containing advice from engineers in the field. The advisory document would be managed by a private company. Jasny and his cohorts think this will lead to greater inconsistencies in traffic signs and road markings around the country. Already, government statistics indicate that most crashes (52 percent) occur in intersections with traffic control devices, and other documents point out that improperly placed signs can actually increase the risk of collision. Diagram from the 2012 version of the US Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (Credit: FHWA).  ""The problem is, we’re going to have local engineers doing different things in each county, and things will vary from county to county ... it will create a safety risk that doesn’t currently exist out there."" The Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety elaborated on these concerns in a letter submitted in March to the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), the agency in charge of the manual, which accepted 179 public comments on the proposed plan to split it in half, many of which were in favor of keeping it as a single document. ""it will create a safety risk that doesn’t currently exist."" But the FHWA argues that dividing the document into two separate books will cut down on costs and actually make things less confusing for local traffic engineers. ""Our proposal would make it easier for state and local transportation engineers to better serve the driving public,"" said Victor Mendez, administrator of FHWA, when announcing the change earlier this year.  The latest version of the manual, last updated in May 2012,  runs just over 800 pages. The FHWA’s new plan would cut that down into ""two smaller documents."" Right now, the manual contains just about everything a traffic engineer working for a municipal, county, or state government would ever want to know about the laws regulating traffic signs, signals, and road markings in the US, as well as recommended best practices for how and where to place certain items on roads. For example, one section is focused on new standards for ""maintaining minimum retroreflectivity,"" for road signs — that is, the legally required minimum light a sign needs to reflect directly back at a driver at night when illuminated by their vehicle’s headlights so they can read it even in the dark. The manual even goes into painstaking detail about such uncommon features on US roads as roundabouts. Diagram from the 2012 version of the US Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (Credit: FHWA).  Regulating the uniformity of millions of road signs across America's 3.9 million miles of roadway, has historically been a difficult and diffuse challenge, one that has tested civil engineers, scientists and policymakers alike. This is especially true because the majority of roads — 3.1 million miles — are rural, where oversight is more difficult. The first modern stop sign wasn’t created until the early 1900s, for example, and it took another 30 years for it to be codified in the first Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices in 1935. Since then, the manual has been slow to update, with only eight major new editions released over the past 80 years. But the FHWA announced sweeping changes to the MUTCD in the early 2000s, including a deadline of September 2015 for when local governments need to have plans in place for testing the reflectivity of their signs at night and upgrading ones that don't meet the standards. ""That’s never been defined."" Today, the MUTCD is facing something of an existential crisis that goes well beyond upgrading sign reflectivity. As Gene Hawkins, a professor of civil engineering at Texas A&M University, puts it: ""Who is the MUTCD written for? Is it written for engineers, technicians, local elected officials? Should it contain step-by-step instructions or just basic principles? That’s never been defined."" Hawkins is part of a national committee that provides recommendations to the FHWA, and the committee is currently attempting to draft a new strategy document to help answer these very questions, and is aiming to circulate an initial draft in June. To be fair, the FHWA is trying to speed things up when it comes to traffic safety engineering guidelines. It published new technical documents on road sign reflectivity online just this April, for example, ""in response to questions FHWA has fielded since the publications were originally posted,"" as a spokesperson told The Verge. The FHWA did not say when exactly it would split the manual into two.",0.5327791381557452,0.4672208618442548,0.8596282023276681,909,5.078107810781078,463,6.3110151187904968,0,0,"Policy & Law, Science, Report",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

""It is Poland's first face transplant and also the first in the world done to save the patient's life,"" Anna Uryga, spokeswoman for the Cancer Centre and Institute of Oncology in Gliwice, Poland, told the AFP.  Essentially last-ditch efforts Indeed, the complex procedures — which remain experimental and rare — have until now been used to improve a patient's quality of life, not save it. They're essentially last-ditch efforts to restore key functions, like blinking or breathing through the nose, and to offer patients with severe facial injuries some degree of aesthetic improvement. Each transplant requires months of planning by surgical teams, and typically entails a lengthy search for the right donor — an individual whose skin tone, age, and sex correspond to the patient. The patient's only chance at survival But in this instance, a face transplant was seen as the patient's only chance at survival. Prior to the surgery, the extent of the man's facial injuries were so severe that doctors feared ""his life was on the line."" He was also unable to eat or speak.  The 27-hour transplant, which relied on tissues and bone from the face of a deceased man in his 30's, is likely to change that: surgeons anticipate that the patient, identified to media outlets only as Grzegorz, will be able to eat, speak, and see, and should have most of his facial function restored within eight months. He will, however, undergo extensive rehab and be required to take a regime of immunosuppression drugs for the rest of his life. The drugs, which prevent the body from rejecting foreign tissue, are associated with an increased risk of some cancers, as well as opportunistic infections. Worldwide, fewer than 30 face transplants have been performed, with seven of them taking place in the US.

To an innocent viewer, the message is clear enough: the Russian internet is no place for the weak. The Russian internet is no place for the weak The NBC report made the rounds Thursday and, within 24 hours, was revealed to be almost entirely bogus. The reporter was in Moscow, more than 1,000 miles away from Sochi. All the malware downloads were initiated by the reporter, after seeking out sites where malware was likely to be found. Even worse, there was nothing local about it. Aside from Google Search's geographical bias, which shows more Russian sites to Russian visitors, Engel could have found the same page and the same malware without leaving New York. The Russian hackers, so threatening on TV, turned out to be not much more than a camera trick. The hackers turned out to be not much more than a camera trick That's not to say the Sochi games are entirely malware free. There have been plausible reports of Flash-targeting exploits on the local Wi-Fi networks, and the State Department has already warned visitors of unofficial live-streams that could be used to spread viruses. But much of that is just standard issue web hygiene, and so far pirated Olympics coverage hasn't proved much more dangerous than, say, the new Hobbit. So why all the obsession with the Russian hacker figure? Why is the myth of the virus-laden Olympics so hard to dismiss? On some level, it's because the myth isn't all myth. Russia really is a net malware exporter, and any time a private company attempts a botnet census, the country is usually first by a mile. They make most of the fraud-based software on the web, and host most of it too. Network-based fraud is still a lucrative business, and as arrest after arrest shows, it's one the Russian crime syndicates have adopted as their own. There's a darker side to the false hacking claims At the same time, the very nature of those crimes makes geography largely irrelevant. The primary tools of network crime, tools like botnets and social engineering for account details, work no matter where you are. There are extra tricks that can be pulled in close proximity, like the Wi-Fi exploit mentioned earlier, but there's no indication those tricks are actually being used, and the extra police attention at the Sochi games is likely to make the hacks more trouble than they're worth. One of the most intensive campaigns of digital surveillance in the 21st Century All that would just make the reports a harmless diversion, a non-story — but there's a darker side to the false hacking claims, and it comes from the people running the networks in the first place. For most security researchers, the games aren't an example of digital lawlessness, but one of the most intensive short-term campaigns of digital surveillance the 21st century has ever seen. As The Guardian has previously reported, Russian authorities are closely monitoring all web and phone traffic using a new version of their Sorm system upgraded specifically for the games. Rather than relying on sketchy open Wi-Fi from third parties, most visitors will be treated to a high-speed network maintained by the Russian government, and presumably closely monitored by state security operatives. As one Globe and Mail writer put it, ""during the Games, it is reasonable to assume that all phone calls, e-mail, texts, web browsing, online banking and access to voice mail will be intercepted and exploited."" And not by hackers, but by the government. Something much more troubling than a few bad downloads This distinction is particularly crucial because the fear of wild hackers is one of the things that allows that very system to be set up. By now, President Putin might not see the need to justify surveillance to Russians — but if any visitors wonder why the FSB needs such intensive access to the phone lines, the NBC report and others like it could go a long way towards convincing them. The phenomenon isn't unique to Russia either. When President Obama needed to defend NSA surveillance as a vital to national security, cybercrime was first on the agenda, playing off fears of financial attacks and Chinese malware bombs. The point was simple enough: as long as the open web is dangerous, you're better off with someone listening in. Who else will protect you from the hackers? Of course, NBC and Engel surely have no interest in justifying Russian surveillance, but by taking the country’s reputation for cybercrime at face value, they may have given credence to something much more troubling than just a few bad downloads. We don't yet know if Sochi is a direct target for hackers, but we do know that there are more powerful things to fear.",0.5267915275304308,0.4732084724695692,0.19917394206029748,850,4.8858823529411763,455,5.9956043956043956,0,0,"US & World, Editorial",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

Plotting the dynamics of Mexican drug cartels against the price of corn between 1990 and 2010, ""From Maize to Haze"" posits a new dynamic in the drug trade, in which a plummeting corn price leads farmers to shift to growing poppies or marijuana, which then spurs violence as cartels fight over control over the newly created drug production. The study's authors zero in on the plummeting price of corn, Mexico's largest agricultural product, which dropped 59 percent in the 15 years after 1990, thanks in part to the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement.

According to people apparently familiar with the matter, the agency has struggled to adapt to the decline in landline use, and the orders sent to companies don't cover ""most"" mobile phone records. One official says that because the agency is not allowed to keep cellphone location records in the database, figuring out how to purge them has delayed attempts to modernize the program. NSA head Keith Alexander has said that the agency is not currently collecting any location information under the program, but in 2010 and 2011, it gathered cellphone location data as part of a test project. The Washington Post has published similar reports, although officials tell it that the number is between 20 and 30 percent. According to them, however, this is the result of a steep decline: in 2006, the NSA was reportedly collecting ""nearly all records from a number of US companies,"" but the number had dropped to 30 percent by the summer of 2013, when the program's existence was first leaked. Officials tell the Post that the agency has been attempting to bring that number back up and is preparing to ask more phone providers for records; in some cases, agents can also effectively get information that's not in the database when people on non-covered carriers call a network whose records are in the database. A limited and largely landline-based database would greatly reduce the chances of surveillance for many Americans, though the total number of records would still be vast. As the Journal notes, a line in one of the reviews commissioned by the White House states that ""the metadata captured by the program covers only a portion of the records of only a few telephone service providers."" Former CIA deputy director Michael Morell, the panel's head, also wrote an editorial in which he said the database covers ""only a subset of the total calls made."" Given how few service providers operate in major US markets, the former claim is somewhat ambiguous. A surveillance program that collects less than a quarter of records and focuses on landlines, however, seems to clash with the intelligence community's own description of what the database allows. In his editorial, Morell said that the tool could provide evidence that ""certain known terrorists were most likely not in phone contact with anyone in the United States."" Director of National Intelligence James Clapper has made similar claims, and the deputy attorney general, James Cole, said in July of 2013 that ""if you're looking for the needle in the haystack, you have to have the entire haystack to look through."" Another White House report said that one of the benefits of the program was negative reporting.

While the ceremony was supposed to feature all five rings growing from small snowflakes into the Olympic logo's five intersecting circles, the top-right ring failed to expand alongside the others, leaving four circles beside what looked almost like an asterisk.  GIF by Gawker. While that may be a glaring mistake in the ceremony, the full show was apparently quite impressive. ""The ambition … is to create the biggest show ever,"" George Tsypin, the opening ceremony's production designer, tells NBC's Today. Tsypin previously worked on big Broadway musicals, including the ill-fated Spiderman: Turn off the Dark, which suffered myriad problems and delays during production, and recently folded with projected losses of $60 million. Still, Tsypin planned to shake off that failure by turning his Broadway skill set to the international stage of the 2014 Winter Olympics: his goal for the opening ceremony was reportedly to showcase a millennium of Russian history through traditional music and dance. Though much of the world has already seen how the full production turned out, US audiences will have to wait until tonight — due to NBC's tape delay, it won't be airing until 7:30PM ET. Update: According to The Associated Press, the rings failed in more ways than one. Originally, they were supposed to erupt into a fireworks display after they opened in unison. From the perspective of Russian TV viewers, however, everything went according to plan, because host broadcaster Rossiya 1 cut away from the failed presentation to successful rehersal footage of the ceremonies when they realized what was happening. Producers told reporters that it was an important move to preserve the imagery of the Olympic Games, and the AP points out that it wouldn't be the first time elements of the ceremonies have been prerecorded to avoid issues.

Google's 2012 privacy policy change led to harsh criticism by several European privacy watchdogs, and France's Commission Nationale de l'Informatique et des Libertés (CNIL) determined last year that the company had failed to address privacy and data protection questions. In January, it levied a €150,000 (around $204,000) fine — the maximum allowed by law — and ordered Google to post a notice of the decision for 48 hours. The notification gives the amount and reason for the fine and a link to CNIL's decision, which Google is currently in the process of appealing. In part because it's still in the appeal process, Google attempted to fight the order, which specified a large-text notice right below the front page's search buttons. ""Google has always maintained that page in a virgin state,"" said attorney Patrice Spinosi. France's top administrative court, however, upheld the decision on Friday. Other companies have been required to post similar notices in Europe; Apple, for example, was required to tell visitors that it lost a UK lawsuit against Samsung but landed in hot water for excessive editorializing. CNIL looked for ways to multiply the fairly low maximum privacy violation fine, and this is a way to make sure deep-pocketed Google feels its effects. France has been particularly pro-active on taking Google to task for privacy violations, but the company is also facing action in the UK, Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands. Its controversial 2012 privacy policy let data be shared between different services like Search and YouTube, something that critics said effectively created invasive, unified user profiles that could not be opted out of. Along with privacy concerns, Google has clashed with European regulators over antitrust laws, recently reaching an agreement that will see it list search results from its competitors alongside recommendations from its own services and theoretically avoid a fine of up to $5 billion.",0.740141598348871,0.25985840165112895,0.6101270841548281,333,5.3423423423423424,223,6.1793721973094167,0,0,"Policy & Law, US & World",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

But the film itself sticks in your mind: a shaggy, draggy story about Sin-Dee and Alexandra, two trans women of color working as prostitutes on Christmas Eve and hell-bent on ""finding the fish"" — the biological female who slept with Sin-Dee’s man. The caper’s resolution is somewhat unsatisfying, but the journey is one to remember: dialogue comes fast and furious, and we expect to hear it quoted on RuPaul’s Drag Race for years to come.   Bryan Bishop: Writer/director Robert Eggers and his team painstakingly recreate 1600s-era New England in this drama about a family that is slowly torn apart by supernatural forces. The performances by Games of Thrones veterans Kate Dickie and Ralph Ineson are wonderful, but the work of Anya Taylor-Joy — as a young girl accused of witchcraft — is the heart of the film. While The Witch isn't quite able to sustain the slow burn of its first two acts, the last half hour is some of the most confident filmmaking I saw this year.   Emily Yoshida: I wrote a lot of words yesterday about Jennifer Phang's mother-daughter drama, but it's worth seeking out for any philosophically-inclined science fiction aficionado. Leads Jacqueline Kim and Samantha Kim have beautiful, moving chemistry as a somewhat isolated parent and child who would do the unthinkable for each other in an increasingly unaffordable future-America.   Bryan Bishop: There have been plenty of films and books about late Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain, but in his new documentary Brett Morgen (The Kid Stays in the Picture) takes a different approach. Using a combination of interviews, animation, and previously unreleased audio and video recordings, Montage of Heck reveals the Cobain behind the persona he wore in public. The result is a film that’s both intimate and unsettling; a reminder that behind the hype and record sales there was simply one man unable to make peace with himself.      Emily Yoshida: While not necessarily the slickest of the documentaries I saw at Sundance, Sophie Deraspe's investigation into the truly bizarre mystery of activist blogger Amina Arraf was certainly the most surprising. More importantly, it uses the promise of a sensational story to bring home its final point — that our hunger for sensational stories often comes at the expense of other underreported, but equally urgent injustices.   Casey Newton: Jean Carlomusto's sympathetic biography of writer and activist Larry Kramer is a compelling look at a controversial figure. But it's also a mesmerizing pocket history of gay life from the the 1970s to today. As Kramer founds the Gay Men's Health Crisis and, later, ACT UP, we see clearly how the AIDS crisis forced gay men out of the closet and into political life. Kramer makes for an occasionally exasperating subject, but ultimately you believe the men in the film who say his activism saved their lives. Alas, though we push ourselves to the limit at Sundance, there are only so many movies a human being can watch in a week. Here are our most regretted misses from the festival.      Emily Yoshida: Crystal Moselle's documentary about a family of homeschooled children locked in a Lower East Side apartment for most of their lives is already courting some controversy. Some reviewers compare its intimate portrayal of a dysfunctional home to Grey Gardens; while some say it's dangerously gawky about what essentially amounts to child abuse. I would have liked a chance to see it and judge for myself; it's certainly among the biggest ""WTF"" premises of the documentary program this year.   Casey Newton: Writing duties kept me away from this period piece about the notorious 1971 study on the psychology of imprisonment. But riding shuttles around Park City, I kept hearing about it from other festival-goers. Based on real events, the film follows what happens after 24 male undergraduates at Stanford are randomly divided into two camps — guards and inmates. It's a grim tale with continued relevance in the bleak prison state that is America, and I'm sorry I missed it.   Bryan Bishop: The fifth film from writer/director Rick Famuyiwa focuses on a group of outcast Inglewood teens obsessed with ‘90s culture. When one of them accidentally ends up with a backpack full of molly from a local drug dealer, hijinks ensue. Dope kept surfacing in random conversations, usually with comparisons to some of my favorite indie classics (I'll avoid mentioning which ones, as they tended to infer things that are probably best unknown upon first viewing). Though I missed it this time around, I'll definitely get a chance to see it soon: Dope got picked up by Sony Pictures in one of the bigger deals of the festival.",0.8859078129459652,0.11409218705403479,0.16078943744283633,818,4.8948655256723717,489,6.2126789366053172,0,18,"Culture, Entertainment, Film",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

You can see the biggest and best of this week's releases below.   So here's something crazy: the first trailer for Fantastic Four came out this week, and it actually looks really cool. That's not to say there was a lot of reason to doubt the cast and crew behind this movie, just that the Fantastic Four movies from the 2000s didn't go over very well. It looks like a lot more care has been taken this time around. The reboot will be out on August 7th.   This is just a short commercial, but it has some better footage than you'll find in the next Terminator's actual trailer (e.g. that T-1000 walking out of the flames is pretty sweet). The movie is scheduled for a July 1st release.   I have strong doubts about this movie making any sense, but maybe that doesn't actually matter. This trailer is so ridiculous that it's kind of great, and it definitely looks cool. Unless they reconsider and decide to use this footage for a prog-rock music video, the film will be in theaters March 20th.   Yeah, it may be a direct-to-DVD / Blu-ray / VOD movie, but it's a martial arts movie that stars and is co-written by RZA, so don't act like you aren't at least a tiny bit interested. It'll be out April 14th.   Tom Hardy, Noomi Rapace, and Gary Oldman all star in Child 44, which are three good reasons to see how it looks. Hardy stars as a scorned secret police agent in Soviet Russia who ends up hunting down a serial killer who's been going after children. It'll be in theaters April 17th.   Mia Wasikowska is a wonderful actor, so it's definitely worth checking out this adaptation of Madame Bovary, which has her as the star. The film will be in theaters sometime this summer.      Here's something a little different than what you usually see in theaters: each year, just before the Oscars, Shorts HD grabs all of the Oscar-nominated short films and puts them back to back for theatrical screenings. Above is the trailer for the live-action shorts.   Shorts HD does the same thing for the animated shorts that receive Oscar nominations. This is always a fun one to see because of how many totally different art styles and storytelling approaches usually turn up. Both the animated and live-action shorts will start playing in theaters January 30th and head on-demand in February.   Seth MacFarlane's gross-out comedy Ted is getting a sequel this year, and its first trailer came out this week. You should definitely watch if you like Seth MacFarlane, the original Ted, or penis and sperm jokes. That all said, it's kind of surprising to see that Ted 2 also appears, in part, to try to provide social commentary about equality. We'll see how well that pans out when the film is released on June 26th.   Okay, there's not actually anything to this teaser, but who cares? Somehow, the film's amazing cast is getting back together, and we'll be able to see it all on Netflix in the not-too-distant future.",0.647281947559796,0.35271805244020404,0.17508277216627635,577,4.415944540727903,314,5.4458598726114653,0,0,"Culture, Entertainment",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Both services angle themselves towards the more committed audiophile, offering daily track recommendations, curated playlists, interviews with artists, and audio available to stream and download in the lossless FLAC format. WiMp currently boasts around 580,000 paying users WiMP was the first of the two services to launch in 2010 and is currently available in Denmark, Germany, Norway, Poland, and Sweden. This is a limited customer base compared to the likes of Spotify, but these countries are where streaming has firmly taken hold and as of June 2014 WiMP boasted some 580,000 paying users. Tidal, meanwhile, is built off the back of WiMP and launched in the US and UK last year.  Tidal's music streaming service on a laptop. For $19.99 a month Tidal users get access to 25 million tracks  and some 75,000 music videos, with audio available to stream and download in the 16-bit FLAC format. This is a significant markup compared to rival services like Spotify and Rdio, both of which offer subscriptions for $9.99 a month. Both WiMP and Tidal are available on a range of devices, including Android, iOS, and Windows Phone. Jay Z, who is estimated to be worth some $520 million, is seeking to buy Asipro via his company Project Panther Bidco. Norwegian media company Schibsted, which owns a majority share in Aspiro, accepted the bid this Friday while Aspiro's board has ""unanimously recommended"" that the shareholders accept the offer. Project Panther said that it had been following the development of Aspiro for some time, describing it as ""an innovative high-quality company with strong future growth potential."" Jay Z joins Dr Dre and Neil Young as musicians who have moved into distribution No doubt Jay Z was in part inspired by the success of fellow musicians entering the music industry on the distributor's side. Neil Young's successful crowdfunding of his $399 high-definition audio player Pono has proved that there is certainly a market for high-end audio, while Apple is reportedly preparing to re-launch Dr Dre's Beats Music streaming service later this year.

From soaring over San Francisco to exploring the streets of Syria, VR took us everywhere. These are our festival favorites.   Bryan Bishop: Directed by Saschka Unseld, Oculus’ first VR movie was the moment we’d been waiting for: a complete narrative experience with a story, characters we enjoyed watching, and a gorgeous, immersive world. We felt for the disembodied robot hand, hid behind virtual bushes when its owner approached, and we couldn’t stop smiling the entire time. While we’re still in the infancy of VR storytelling, this is the first project that clearly articulates how vast the potential is, and we hated it when Lost was over.   Casey Newton: Anyone who would complain VR isn’t interactive enough should first try Birdly. It’s a thrilling simulation of a flight over San Francisco, experienced while strapped face-down into an odd-looking chair. With your arms spread wide, an Oculus on your face, and headphones on your ears, you find yourself soaring over the city’s downtown, flapping your wings to gain altitude. It’s a calming, meditative experience — at least until you find yourself crashing into the Transamerica Pyramid. Immersive and exciting, Birdly is the kind of VR experience that turns skeptics into true believers.   Casey Newton: A harrowing look at date rape from artist Rose Troche, told from two perspectives. In the first segment, you look through the eyes of a male college student at a party, flirting with a girl who has had too much to drink. After doing shots, ""you"" and a friend lead the girl back to her bedroom. In the second, you watch the same scene unfold, this time through the eyes of the assaulted girl. The scene isn’t interactive, and that’s part of what makes it so upsetting: something terrible is happening, and there’s nothing you can do to stop it. A provocative and unsettling use of VR that could not be more timely.   Bryan Bishop: We first encountered Nonny de la Peña’s ""immersive journalism"" take on VR several years ago, and her latest project takes you to present-day Syria. With the aid of a motion tracking rig, you walk around the street and listen in on a conversation from a group of locals. That’s when the rockets hit. When a young child raced through the dusty aftermath, I tried to chase after him — only to have the person in the demo room gently stop me from running into a wall. While its graphics are relatively primitive, Syria is impressive in its immersion, and heartbreaking when it reminds us that we can’t help children halfway across the world simply by wearing fancy goggles.   Bryan Bishop: While a lot of pieces this year focused on storytelling or replicating real-world scenarios, Way to Go takes off in the exact opposite direction. Directed by Vincent Morisset, the man behind the Sigur Rós film Inni and interactive music videos from Arcade Fire, Way to Go is an audio-visual fever dream. You’re a crude black-and-white figure, able to walk, run, or soar through a mysterious forest as you desire. Colors and sounds wash over you in a synesthesiastic blend as you trip from one world to the next, and your only purpose is to explore and experience. While we played it on the Oculus Rift, Way to Go began life as a web-based project, and you’ll be able to try it there on February 5th.   Casey Newton: Oscar Raby’s project is billed as a multimedia documentary, but we experienced it more as a nightmare. Assent is addressed to Raby’s father, a Chilean army officer who was present during the brutal execution of members of his regiment in the aftermath of a coup. You begin in a crude representation of Raby’s house; by shifting your focus, you’re transported to an area near the hill where Raby’s father witnessed the massacre. Raby describes the shooting, and the events leading up to it, in vivid detail; the father is mute as his son forces him to re-live what may have been the worst day of his life. If there’s a hell, it probably feels a lot like Assent.",0.694019908513747,0.30598009148625305,0.5253583157056287,715,4.8111888111888108,420,6.0547619047619046,0,12,"Culture, Entertainment, Tech",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

I've spent a lot of time saving the world from monsters and engaging in intergalactic warfare, but there are few games that let me experience the drama and excitement of everyday life. Life is Strange does just that. It stars a high school girl in a small town in the Pacific Northwest, and many of the key moments of the first episode deal with typical teenage dilemmas: drugs, relationships, figuring out who you are as a person. It's incredibly refreshing to play a game that's so fixated on everyday, modern life. And it's even more amazing considering it's also a game about time travel. Playing Life is Strange is a lot like playing any game from The Walking Dead developer Telltale (though it’s actually developed by French studio Dontnod, the same team behind cyberpunk action game Remember Me). For one thing, it's episodic: the first two-hour-long episode is available tomorrow, with four more slated to launch with six-week gaps in between. The gameplay is also very similar. There's little action — instead, most of what you'll be doing is exploring the environment and talking to other characters. There's some light puzzle-solving, but decision-making is of the utmost importance: at several key moments you'll be forced to make a choice, which will change how the story unfolds. (Just like in The Walking Dead, when you finish an episode you can see how your choices compare to everyone else who played the game.) The game stars Max Caulfield, a high school senior who returns to her small Oregon hometown after spending five years in Seattle. She's a budding photographer, a bit shy, and is struggling to fit in at her fancy new school. Meanwhile, a fellow student has gone missing, and the town is plastered in flyers to aid in the ongoing search. On top of all of this, Max learns early on that, for some reason, she can control time, which lets her rewind events and make different choices. Despite the sci-fi set-up, the actual moment-to-moment experience of Life is Strange shies away from the fantastical. Max uses her power for the kinds of things you'd expect a teenager to do: get in good with her teacher, help a friend in trouble, get revenge on a bully. After a lifetime of games where the pivotal moments involved slaying zombies or robbing a bank, it's nice to deal with a key puzzle about sexting drama. Initially it seems like the time travel mechanic takes away from the gravitas of making decisions. In The Walking Dead, for instance, you had to make quick choices and they stuck. When someone died because of you, there was no way to change that, and it gave the game an emotional weight that stayed with you long after you stopped playing. But if you could just rewind the game and make a different choice, like you can in Life is Strange, wouldn't that defeat the purpose? The thing is, Life is Strange only shows you the immediate aftermath of your decision, not the long-term consequences. So even if you think one choice turns out better than another, you could be wrong — I already regret at least one of the choices I made in the game. I had the option to snap a picture of an event or intervene, and while stopping the argument helped a friend, it also meant I had no evidence of what went down. It turns out I could've used that evidence. A story that stars a teenage girl and is set in a quaint little town is pretty standard stuff when it comes to fiction, but for a game, the characters and setting make Life is Strange stand out. While it's getting better, games still lag pretty far behind books, movies, and TV when it comes to representing a variety of different people and experiences. You're usually saving the world, and you're usually doing it in some sort of fictional universe. But now that a certain branch of games are starting to closely resemble television, it only makes sense that this is changing. Some of my favorite TV shows, from Buffy to Veronica Mars, are set in high school, with young women as the lead characters; so why can't games do the same? Life is Strange is far from perfect. The first episode starts out pretty slow, and the writing can feel a bit forced, like the developers are trying really hard to make the characters sound like authentic teenagers — I may not be a teen anymore, but I'm pretty sure no one says ""hella"" as much as these kids. It also suffers from some distracting technical problems, like the way the characters' mouths never sync up with their voices, and how their hair looks like it’s made of plastic when it gets wet. But I can look past all of that because of how unique the set-up and characters are. I absolutely love small town murder mysteries, the kind of story where everyone has a secret and no one is who they seem to be at first blush. Life is Strange doesn’t have any murders (at least not yet), but it does have a missing person and plenty of shady characters. And being able to interact with a story like that — to rifle through a suspect's garage, or check out their Facebook page — is amazing. It adds a whole other layer to the experience. It's impossible to tell how the entire season will play out after just one episode, but I'm definitely along for the ride — the debut sets up an incredibly intriguing mystery, and I really want to watch it unfold. But I'm just as excited for the less epic revelations; how Max's relationship with her estranged best friend Chloe will develop, why Chloe's step-dad is such a dick, and just what's up with the school's weird principal. I've saved the world enough. Now I’m excited for something new. Life is Strange’s first episode is available tomorrow on PC, PS3, PS4, Xbox 360, and Xbox One.",0.6268022095469628,0.37319779045303725,0.17241756814139877,1030,4.6077669902912621,525,5.8761904761904766,0,10,"Culture, Entertainment, Gaming, Games Review",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

With a user's permission, iOS 8 allows third-party apps to exchange and update health details that, when paired with more traditional medical tests, can provide a more comprehensive portrait of someone's personal health. At WWDC 2014, Apple software VP Craig Federighi said HealthKit's purpose is to build ""a composite profile of your activity and health."" It puts all of that data in one place so it's easily accessible to third-party apps and medical professionals. Your HealthKit profile includes basics like height, weight, and the amount of steps you take each day. But for patients using optional hardware accessories, HealthKit can also provide information on things like heart rate, blood pressure, body fat percentage, glucose levels, and more. Users can control which third-party apps are allowed to see and modify this data. ""This is just another set of data that we’re confident our physicians will take into account as they make clinical and medical judgments,"" said Dowrkin. ""We don’t really, fully know and understand how patients will want to use this and we’re going to basically stand ready to learn by what will happen."" And if patients want nothing to do with Apple or HealthKit, Dworkin says the solution is easy enough: ignore it entirely. ""The opt-out is just don’t use it.""",0.6403438164435353,0.35965618355646467,0.5249410216845657,335,5.3134328358208958,228,5.9122807017543861,0,0,"Apple, Tech",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It's meant for the average user, but should also prove useful to Facebook as it continues developing its Facebook for Work service.   From a product standpoint, there isn't much to say about video calling in Messenger. From any of your chats, you simply tap the video camera icon to start a call. Once the call has started, you can switch back and forth from the front-facing and rear cameras, or turn your camera off entirely. Stan Chudnovsky, Messenger's head of product, says Facebook's developers focused on making video work well even on relatively low-bandwith cell networks. In a demonstration, call quality was good even inside a building where we only had two bars of connectivity on LTE. Keeping Facebook at the center of its users' communication habits Video calling should help Messenger build on its considerable momentum: the product now has more than 600 million monthly active users, and they're making 10 percent of all internet-based phone calls. While Facebook doesn't profit from the calls, they keep the company at the center of its users' communication habits. In a related move, last week Facebook introduced Hello, an Android dialer and contacts manager that promotes using Facebook for more calls. Earlier in the month, Messenger rolled out a desktop version of the service. It's all part of an effort to turn Messenger into an Asian-style messaging platform like LINE or WeChat, which generate enormous revenues through e-commerce, gaming, and other services.   And as Facebook's business offering comes into focus, video could be a smart area of focus: I've rarely met a business satisfied with its video calling solution. (At The Verge we cycle hopelessly through every solution, switching whenever the service we're using inevitably drops the call.) If Facebook Messenger video turns out to be as good as Chudnovsky promises, it will likely appeal to enterprises.

Two of Instagram's new filters are now its most popular As with the filters that Instagram introduced back in December, these new filters are meant to be far more subtle than its classic filters. The filters include Lark, which ""desaturates reds while punching up blues and greens"" for landscapes; Reyes, which is meant to add a washed out, vintage look to photos; and Juno, which ""tints cool tones green while making warm tones pop and whites glow"" and is targeted at portraits.

VSCO has clearly topped Instagram with its wealth of film-like filters, but Instagram is also responding to something simpler: improvements in smartphone cameras. Mobile photos are now much better than they used to be and don't need heavy filtering to obscure their shortcomings, and these new filters leave a lot more intact. Instagram's filter selection does still leave a lot to be desired, but its new releases are apparently working: two filters released in December, Ludwig and Crema, are now Instagram's most popular. The new filters will be rolling out today on both iOS and Android. The update also includes the ability to use emoji in hashtags, which should be a great way to celebrate the new filter releases. #prayerhands",0.7792108664202075,0.22078913357979246,0.17397537902165747,329,5.0151975683890582,193,5.7616580310880829,0,0,"Apps, Photography, Tech",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

For many of us, they are the most important devices in our lives, justifying their cost. But there’s no ignoring the fact that most smartphones you buy cost $600, $700, or even up to a thousand dollars. For that price, you generally get a great display, speedy performance, a reliable camera, and easy-to-use software. But what if you didn’t have to spend that much to get those features, and still could have a smartphone just as capable as ones costing many hundreds of dollars more? That’s the promise offered by Alcatel Onetouch's new Idol 3. A little known brand in the US, Alcatel Onetouch has produced very low-end models of phones, often branded by the carriers that sell them. The Idol 3 is different: it’s the first flagship device to be sold by the maker in the US, and it doesn’t have any carrier branding at all. Offered unlocked for just $249, the Idol 3 has a spec list that competes with phones costing three or four times as much. And yet, after using the Idol 3 as my primary phone for the past week, I didn’t feel like I was missing anything I get from the much more expensive phones I’m accustomed to.   Alcatel Onetouch is far from the first company to offer a lot of bang for your buck in a smartphone. Google’s Nexus 4 and Nexus 5 packed top-tier specs for half the price of competitors at the time. Similarly, the OnePlus One blew minds last year with its $350 price tag and high-end features. Motorola’s Moto G and Moto E also proved that an entry-level phone doesn’t have to be a terrible experience, even if they can’t compete with the high end of the market. But the Idol 3 isn’t trying to be an entry-level phone. It has a 5.5-inch, 1080p display; an octa-core processor; a slim, lightweight design; a 13-megapixel camera; stereo front speakers; and support for LTE on both AT&T and T-Mobile, as well as a number of prepaid carriers. That kind of spec sheet is what you might expect from a flagship phone from Samsung, LG, or HTC, along with an appropriate flagship price tag. You might say, ""Sure, the Idol 3’s spec sheet reads impressively, but that doesn’t mean it works that well in the real world."" In the Idol 3’s case, it actually does work. Let’s start with the display, because it is arguably the most important part of any smartphone, and the Idol 3’s is just stunning. It’s a 5.5-inch, 1080p IPS panel that pops with vibrancy and color. There’s no air gap thanks to its full lamination, and viewing angles are excellent. It’s also bright enough to be easily visible outdoors and has deep blacks to go along with those vibrant colors. Everything you might want from a smartphone display is present and accounted for, and it makes the screens on other low-cost smartphones like the Nexus 5 and OnePlus One look terrible. Above and below the display are front-facing speakers, which are loud and sound great. They give the HTC One M9’s vaunted BoomSound speakers a run for their money and sound as good as any other high-end phone’s speakers. Cheap phones generally have cheap-looking designs to go with them, but the Idol 3 bucks that trend as well. It’s plastic, instead of the glass, metal, or leather you find on more expensive phones, but it’s not glossy and doesn’t feel cheap in your hand. The most offensive part might be the chromed ring that runs the outside perimeter of the phone, but even that doesn’t look terrible. The Idol 3’s design is mostly just generic, and more than one passerby in The Verge’s NYC office thought it looked like a bigger Nexus 4. Most people thought it was attractive and would have guessed it cost a lot more than $250.   In addition to its stunning display, great audio, and inoffensive design, the Idol 3 is running a nearly stock version of Android 5.0 Lollipop. The visual customizations made by Alcatel Onetouch are limited to a few custom app icons and a tweaked lock screen. Everything else feels like stock Android, which is a wonderful thing and a stark contrast to the cheap phones peddled by carriers in the US that are loaded with confusing customizations and performance-killing bloatware. (The Idol 3 does have a couple apps pre-installed, the most offensive of which is the AVG AntiVirus app, but they can all be uninstalled from the device.) One of the actually useful software tricks in the Idol 3 is the ability to completely flip the user interface depending on how you pick up the phone. Both the top and bottom of the phone have microphones and speakers, so you could pick up the phone ""upside down"" and still answer a call. You could even use the Idol 3 upside down all the time (putting the headphone jack on the bottom) if you want. It also has smart conveniences like double-tap to turn the screen on and muting incoming calls or alarms by flipping the phone over. The Idol 3’s camera is a 13-megapixel autofocus unit with 1080p video capture. It’s a decent camera, one that could embarrass some high-end phones such as HTC’s One M9, but it doesn’t hit the speed and image quality set by the iPhone 6 or Samsung Galaxy S6. Alcatel’s app lets you control focus and exposure manually, but I longed for a quicker launch and autofocus performance. The front camera is a 5-megapixel unit that works just fine for selfies and video chats. At this point, you’re surely looking for the catch in all of this, the bugbear that will take down the Idol 3 and reveal its true status as a cheap, forgettable phone. I can’t really say there is one, but the area where the Idol 3 doesn’t match the best of the best is in raw performance. The Qualcomm Snapdragon 615 processor with 2GB of RAM is enough for the vast majority of everyday tasks, but it won’t keep up with phones running higher-end chips. Most of the time it’s not a problem, but every once in a while there’s an annoying stutter or delay when opening an app that’s enough to remind me I’m not using a top-tier phone. The Idol 3 also doesn’t have conveniences such as quick charging or wireless charging. But its 2,910mAh battery easily keeps the phone going all day, even with heavy use.   After all is said and done, the knocks against the Idol 3 don’t really add up to much. It’s easily the most impressive phone available under $300, and it doesn’t force you to make the compromises that are commonly required by cheap phones. A few years ago, it was unfathomable to expect this kind of performance or experience with a cheap phone. A terrible display, useless camera, painful software experience, and ugly design were the norm. While the Idol 3 isn’t the first phone to go against that grain, it is the one that pushes the envelope the furthest, whether that’s by its great user experience or rock-bottom price.",0.644303401209885,0.35569659879011495,0.15268315836899904,1203,4.6674979218620116,575,5.8886956521739133,0,12,"Google, Mobile, Tech, Review",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Now it’s trying to have the same kind of impact with the Apple Watch, a feat that may be a bit more challenging. The traditional watch industry isn’t in trouble, or in need of reinvention. The nearly recession-proof Swiss watch market has continued to grow, exporting over 28 million watches to the tune of $21 billion in revenue in 2014, and by all indications that growth hasn’t shown any signs of slowing down. This is a new challenge for Apple; can it turn a piece of technology into a massively desired fashion accessory? And can the Apple Watch stand up against its competition, from low-end quartz watches to high-end Rolexes? To answer these and many other questions, we put the Apple Watch in the hands of a mechanical watchmaker, the exact type of person Apple is trying to make obsolete. John Tarantino is the founder and CEO of Martenero, one of the few mechanical watch companies based in the US. Martenero sells customizable mechanical watches built in New York City for around $500, a price point that undersells the quality of its timepieces. The Verge sat down with Tarantino (and a 42mm Apple Watch with a leather loop) to discuss his initial thoughts on the Apple Watch as a watchmaker and its potential impact on the mechanical watch market, and to find out if he will purchase one. This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity and brevity.   ""It looks very nicely done.""   As I look at it more and more, it looks like an Apple product. This makes sense. The lines, the curvature around the edge — absolutely true to their aesthetic. I like how the crown is more integrated into the case; it actually looks like it's sort of embedded ever so slightly, as opposed to a traditional mechanical one that juts out more. It looks very nicely done. For some reason, I was expecting something that kind of popped a little more. This is very sleek; it sort of blends into your wrist nicely. I was expecting something that drew a little bit more attention to itself. ""Watches are about a lot more than telling the time."" ""Right this second I wouldn’t say I consider it a threat."" It could really turn into an interesting category. What that means for the mechanical watch world, that’s yet to be determined. There was the quartz crisis in the '70s — that’s something that was more revolutionary than smartwatches. This seems less revolutionary. With quartz, all of a sudden there was this much cheaper and more accurate technology, and yet, ultimately mechanical watches bounced back. There’s something else about them that really, really appeals to a sizable group of people that quartz just doesn’t capture. I think there might be some of the same thing going on here. ""They’ve got to appeal to the emotional side of people. It’s not just practicality."" Not at all surprised that they did something nice. Good build quality, interesting strap. I’m not surprised at all, they make good hardware. I think there’s going to be a ton of curiosity about it. I predict that these are going to sell in droves. But from there I wonder if it’s the kind of thing that’s going to — in its current form at least — maintain people’s interest. ""It’s got to have a reason to exist on its own."" I think I would probably have fun for like a week, two weeks, playing around with it. It seems that it’s not as intuitive as other Apple products. I’m sure I’d eventually figure it out and come to enjoy it. It’s sort of like a mini iPhone with a Fitbit mixed in; it doesn't seem like it provides enough extra functionality to really keep people interested. I think there’s going to be huge curiosity about it, and I think in the current form, there might be a lot of people who wear it for a few weeks and put it away for a while.

While the software giant focuses its efforts across multiple platforms, Windows is gearing up for big changes. That change will be on full show at Microsoft’s Build developers conference on Wednesday, and it’s a key moment for the company to prove it’s got what it takes to keep Windows relevant in a mobile era that continues to ignore Microsoft’s efforts. With Windows Phone increasingly squeezed out by Android and iOS, this year’s Build conference feels like a last chance for Microsoft to woo mobile developers and get the apps it needs for a successful future.  Microsoft is returning to its roots to bring back the Start Menu and a more PC-friendly version of Windows, and many changes that move it away from an obsession with touchscreens on PCs and laptops. The software maker is also looking toward Office and its Azure cloud for the future of how it delivers key applications and services across Windows, iOS, and Android. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has always talked about a mobile- and cloud-focused company, and that has been emerging clearly over the past year. Below is everything we expect Microsoft to talk about on Wednesday. The event starts Wednesday at 11:30AM ET / 8:30AM PT. We'll be in San Francisco covering the event, and you'll be able to follow along with our live blog for up-to-the-second reports. Developers are key to Microsoft’s current and future platforms. It’s fair to say the company hasn’t made it easy for its loyal community over the years, with constant changes, reversals, and just a lack of key developer APIs to create apps that really shine on Windows. With Windows 10, it’s Microsoft’s opportunity to correct some prior mistakes and really align all of its various products to a single mission. That mission is universal apps, or Windows Apps as they’re now known today. The key to getting a Windows Store full of Windows Apps will be convincing developers to build them, and that’s the biggest task Microsoft faces at Build this week. Microsoft has re-engineered its new Windows Apps so they’re no longer fullscreen and they work across PCs, tablets, phones, and even the Xbox One gaming console. We’ve seen a few examples of how this could work in Microsoft’s own previews, but this week it’s time for the company to demonstrate the power of Windows Apps and why developers should care. Expect to see universal apps running across all platforms, including the Xbox One, and a clearer idea of when consumers will get access to Windows 10 across PCs, phones, tablets, and the Xbox One. While Microsoft has been previewing the vast majority of Windows 10 to the public, there’s still some parts not everyone has seen. Terry Myerson, the chief of Windows, will be on stage at Build on Wednesday to talk about the progress of Windows 10 and the company’s app strategy. Last year, Myerson revealed the new Start Menu before Microsoft was even ready to talk about Windows 10, and we expect this year to be similarly forward-looking. Recent rumors have pointed toward a Redstone wave of releases next year that are designed to be updates to Windows 10, and Microsoft previously hinted at a ""Windows as a service"" model to provide regular updates to the operating system. We expect Myerson to detail this service model more fully, with a look at how Microsoft plans to update Windows 10 once it’s ready this summer. Part of that updating will involve the company’s plans for Project Spartan, its new Internet Explorer successor. Microsoft has not yet named Project Spartan, but we understand the company has a name in mind that it has been trialling in market research. It’s likely that Microsoft will finally name the new brand for Internet Explorer on Wednesday, and clarify how the old browser will exist in enterprise copies of Windows. Elsewhere, Microsoft has to name the date of when Windows 10 will be available. The company previously said summer, and AMD’s CEO recently revealed it’s likely to be late July. With speculation mounting over the launch date, it’s time for Microsoft to clarify and provide a timeline for when the new operating system will reach devices like the Xbox One or Lumia phones. Myerson will also focus on what might become the biggest news of the day: Microsoft eyeing Android apps for Windows 10. While the software maker has been investigating many methods of bringing Android apps to Windows, it has found a solution. Myerson will unveil a series of ways Microsoft is making it easier for developers to bring their code to Windows universal apps from Android, iOS, or elsewhere. Part of that will include better tools for developers and new ways to closely map the functions of Android to Windows so it’s easier for developers to port their apps with small changes. It might not be the ideal solution, but it could be enough to convince Android developers to list their apps in the Windows Store without a lot of effort. Getting more apps on Windows Phones is key, but Microsoft also needs impressive hardware to really spur interest in its platform. A new flagship Lumia won’t be available until Windows 10 is available on phones, but that might not stop Microsoft from detailing some of its hardware ideas for the future of Lumia — in particular, how Windows 10 will work on bigger phones or 7-inch tablets. Some leaked screenshots suggest it scales up the Windows Phone UI, and we expect Microsoft to discuss its plans for these devices. Microsoft may also address the idea of allowing hardware makers to create phones that turn into tablets or full PCs, thanks to the versatility of Windows 10 and the new universal Windows Apps. Microsoft’s work with Windows 10 on phones is very basic in its preview state right now, and many will be looking to see if the company shows more future plans or an updated preview that includes greater changes. With Microsoft preparing at least four new Lumia devices for Windows 10, we expect to hear some details of what unique features Windows 10 will enable. Those include new gestures using a variety of phone sensors, and even the new Windows Hello feature that allows you to sign into a device with just your face. Microsoft promised more HoloLens details at Build, and it’s about to deliver. We expect HoloLens will feature in the Windows part of the keynote, with a big, flashy demo on stage. Microsoft has been gradually providing developers more details about HoloLens, but at Build it’s time to show how Windows Apps (universal apps) can also work as holograms in the future. Expect to see a demonstration of a Windows App running natively on HoloLens, and a lot of details on how developers will get access to HoloLens. Speaking of demos, it’s likely that Microsoft will let developers get actual hands-on time with HoloLens. While media outlets were able to sample an early development kit back in January, this week’s potential hands-on time could involve a near-final retail headset. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella is planning to talk about Office as a platform at Build on Wednesday. Microsoft has been increasingly using Office as a key part of its cross-platform strategy, with various apps on Windows, iOS, and Android. Microsoft now wants to discuss how it can open up the power of Office to developers, and the company’s Office Graph could play a key role here. While we don’t expect Office to go open source, Microsoft could open up more of the data from its Office Graph to bring machine learning to every app. Likewise, this machine learning powerhouse will be extended to Microsoft’s Azure work. Microsoft has been making huge investments in data and machine learning, and extending those to developers to use within apps and services could be a key way to position its cloud as a support tool for companies to rely on. While Microsoft usually focused on Windows at Build, it’s a different kind of company now. We’ve increasingly seen that over the past year — and even with the debut of many Apple Watch apps recently — and we expect Build to focus on Microsoft’s cross-platform plans, too. We’ve heard rumors of a dedicated iOS and Android app built to connect these devices to Windows 10, and Microsoft has previously hinted at Cortana arriving on rival platforms. Build feels like a good time for Microsoft to explain why you might really want a Windows 10 PC, but still use an iPhone or Android handset to connect to it closely without needing to opt for a Windows phone straight away. It’s all part of getting consumers using Microsoft’s services across every device, and we expect to hear some announcements around this core idea at Build. Microsoft is investing heavily in Internet of Things (IoT) devices, and that will be demonstrated at Build. A free version of Windows 10 will be available for Raspberry Pi 2 devices, but we haven’t yet seen how this will look and work. If a Raspberry Pi 2 can run universal Windows Apps, then that could open up Microsoft’s platform to millions of devices in future. Microsoft promised more information on its Windows 10 IoT plans ""in the coming months"" back in February, so it’s definitely time to hear about the future of Windows.

""They form a landscape-based proto-cinema.""  ""We animated an image of a bird."" Baker and his colleagues at Cambridge made the discovery by using laser scanners to import 150,000-plus rock carvings in Italy's Valcamonica valley into computers. The carvings include animal figures, human characters, weapons and tools, and other geometric shapes, but researchers focused on ones that appeared to be expressing motion, showing thrusting spears or a bird flapping its wings. They then took the digitized images and reanimated them with software as if they were still frames in a movie, speeding up the natural motion caused by sunlight. “We animated an image of a bird,” Baker said in a statement, “and not only got it to fly in an absolutely naturalistic sense, but found that concentric arcs inside its body were not plumage but follow the graphic logic of a bird’s beating wings.” The researchers also believe early humans played instruments to provide a type of soundtrack to accompany the rock carving animations. To recreate the experience, archaeologists made their own interactive film first shown in March at an exhibit at the University Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology in Cambridge. Now they plan to do follow-up studies of the valley carvings using micro drones and other portable scanning equipment, to try and link carvings to one another and distinct artists.",0.7701550332831674,0.22984496671683263,0.8580841137415144,336,5.1696428571428568,225,6.1200000000000001,0,0,Science,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The milestone marks the first time since March, when the H7N9 outbreak first began, that human cases haven't continued to increase.  In the week beginning May 13, one previously infected patient succumbed to the virus, according to a statement issued on Monday by China's National Health and Family Planning Commission. That death brings the H7N9 fatality toll to 36, with 130 confirmed cases in total.

That's a promising signal, as health experts around the world have cautioned for months that, were H7N9 to mutate and become more easily transmissible, the virus would likely attain pandemic status. H7N9 also appears to be particularly deadly to humans, with World Health Organization (WHO) officials in April describing it as ""one of the most lethal influenza viruses"" that scientists have ever seen. Warmer weather lulling the virus into temporary submission The virus' current ebb is likely due to a combination of factors. For one, the seasonal nature of influenzas might be contributing to a decrease in infection rates, with warmer weather lulling the virus into temporary submission. The widespread closure of live-poultry markets, a suspected source of the virus, may also have helped.  While several provinces have already scaled back their emergency response protocols, global health officials are also warning that H7N9 likely isn't gone for good.

""These are the very sickest patients,"" Early, who estimates that he's treated 80 people over 500 sessions with the method, says. ""And the results have been dumbfounding.""    Powerful hallucinogenic properties The surprising source of these stunning outcomes? Ketamine — used among medical practitioners as an anesthetic, but perhaps best known as ""Special K"" and popularized as a recreational drug because of its powerful hallucinogenic properties. But in lower doses, Early is convinced that ketamine can also make a meaningful difference for those suffering from severe depression: in his own practice, he's seen ""the vast majority of patients"" improve after a single treatment. It's unclear how many US psychiatrists are currently treating patients with ketamine, though Early — who runs an informal online network for practitioners using the drug — estimates that the figure runs in the low dozens. And according to a growing body of research, Early and that cohort might be onto something. This week, investigators behind the largest clinical trial on ketamine yet — an evaluation of 72 patients out of Baylor College of Medicine and the Mount Sinai School of Medicine — announced the impressive results of their new study at the annual meeting of the American Psychiatric Association. All of the patients in the trial had been diagnosed with treatment-resistant depression — a description that characterizes around one-third of those suffering from depression — meaning they'd tried at least two conventional antidepressants without experiencing relief. Investigators randomly divided those patients into two groups: half received a dose of ketamine intravenously over a span of 40 minutes, while the other half received an IV drip of midazolam — an anesthetic that doesn't seem to have antidepressant properties. Marked improvements in depressive symptoms Within a period of 24 hours, 63.8 percent of patients who'd received ketamine experienced marked improvements in depressive symptoms, versus 28 percent of those in the placebo group. And after a week, nearly half of the ketamine patients were still benefiting from that single dose. The findings build on several earlier studies comparing ketamine to a placebo, most of which have reached similar conclusions: in doses with around 25 percent the potency as those used in anesthesia, ketamine often improves symptoms of depression quickly, and those benefits linger for anywhere from three to 14 days. This latest research, however, is particularly compelling because it compared ketamine to another anesthetic, rather than an inert placebo. ""We wanted to pit ketamine, head-to-head, with something that patients would notice [and] that would affect their central nervous system,"" says study co-author James Murrough, MD, an assistant professor of psychiatry at Mount Sinai. ""It's a higher bar to test the hypothesis that this antidepressant effect of ketamine isn't a side effect of being anesthetized."" Some patients experience noticeable mood changes within four hours Already, experts have devised a theory to explain how ketamine treats depression: It acts on the neurotransmitter glutamate — in contrast to conventional antidepressants, which instead target serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine. The mechanism, researchers suspect, elicits a surge of glutamate, which in turn stimulates new neural connections, essentially repairing circuitry damaged by depression. In fact, ketamine works so quickly that some patients experience noticeable mood changes within four hours — a stark contrast to the six-week period required for traditional antidepressants to either take hold or prove ineffective. ""You can tell within hours if a patient is going to respond or not,"" says John Mann, MD, a professor of translational neuroscience at Columbia University who has done extensive research on ketamine. ""Compared to a waiting game of more than a month, that's a very big thing.""  But despite ketamine's promise — and the handful of psychiatrists and patients who already swear by it — those investigating the drug warn that it's too soon to be hooking patients up to IV drips. Research thus far has only studied ketamine on small patient pools, and investigators have yet to determine optimal ketamine doses or methods of delivery. ""Anyone using ketamine clinically right now ... is doing so on the basis of relatively limited experience and highly limited trial data,"" Mann says. ""There are still important clinical questions that need to be addressed."" ""Similar to using nitrous oxide at the dentist ... or a short-acting high from marijuana."" A comprehensive understanding of ketamine's short and long-term side effects also remains to be established — although side effects detected thus far appear relatively mild, and tend to ebb off within a few hours. Some patients suffer from slight elevations in blood pressure. Others experience what one psychiatrist using ketamine, Dr. William Goldman, describes as ""similar to using nitrous oxide at the dentist ... or a short-acting high from marijuana"" — essentially milder versions of the hallucinogenic effects that ketamine yields when ingested in higher quantities. And compared to the potential side effects of conventional antidepressants, which can include appetite changes, sexual dysfunction, and insomnia, ketamine's downsides appear downright benign. ""That's an important bottom line here,"" Murrough says. ""None of the side effects we've seen have persisted beyond the treatment session."" Pharmaceutical companies aren't interested It may take years, researchers say, before ketamine is FDA-approved to treat depression: that process will require significantly larger clinical trials that also evaluate long-term outcomes. And because ketamine is already off patent — meaning not particularly profitable — pharmaceutical companies aren't interested in funding those studies, Murrough notes, though several are currently devising drugs that act similarly to ketamine. ""What we need are the tens of millions of dollars to move this research along,""  he says. ""Someone is going to have to invest, but the question is who's interested."" Because the drug is already approved as an anesthetic, doctors like Feary and Goldman can continue to prescribe ketamine, in what's known as ""off-label"" use. At least, for now. ""Those of us that do ketamine therapy will run into resistance,"" Feary anticipates. ""I have no doubt that some overzealous regulator will come shut us down eventually."" ""That clinicians are doing this speaks to the desperation of these patients."" But even Murrough, who cautions against the practice and doesn't use ketamine on his own patients, has a tough time criticizing those choosing to do so. ""That clinicians are doing this speaks to the desperation of these patients,"" he says. ""Who am I to tell them, ‘sorry, but you need to wait five years for more research before you can feel better'?""",0.5036702132815902,0.49632978671840977,0.5407082928099674,1123,5.533392698130009,593,6.5885328836424959,0,0,"Science, Report",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Nonetheless, the results indicate that for the children who were surveyed in this case, there was a statistically significant difference in the obesity rates between those diagnosed with childhood ADHD and those without.  The study focused on a group of 207 boys diagnosed with ADHD ages 6 to 12, who researchers described as ""middle class, medically healthy"" and caucasian, with English-speaking parents.

As the New York Times reports, several studies have exposed an alarming discrepancy in the life expectancies of immigrants and their US-born children, with the latter demonstrating higher rates of heart disease, diabetes, and high blood pressure. The trend is particularly sharp among Hispanics, who now comprise the largest immigrant group in the US. Among this demographic, the foreign born live an average of three years longer than those born in the US, according to several studies. It's difficult to identify a single cause for this discrepancy, but researchers say this growing body of evidence suggests that America's higher wages and better standards of living are often outweighed by a more sedentary, less healthy lifestyle. ""We have a time bomb that's going to go off."" Most agree that socioeconomic status likely plays a role. A 2011 study from Brown University found that higher smoking rates among second generation Hispanics could explain half of the three-year discrepancy between life expectancies of children and their parents. According to the researchers, US-born Hispanics are generally part of a lower income group that exhibits higher smoking and drinking rates — behaviors that immigrant children tend to adopt. It's not clear how this trend will evolve over future generations; as second- and third-generation Americans attain higher socioeconomic levels, they may see their health improve. There's also wide variation across ethnic groups; US-born Puerto Ricans, for instance, exhibit among the shortest lifespans, which could drag down the averages for Hispanics as a whole. Nevertheless, the numbers remain alarming. A 2006 study found that cancer mortality rates were about 20 percent lower among immigrants compared to their US-born counterparts, with mortality rates from cirrhosis about 24 percent lower. Compared to white US-born adults, Hispanics are 14 percent more likely to be obese, and exhibit even higher rates of diabetes.The implication for some, then, is that the healthy diets and lifestyles adopted in other countries tend to fade away once families relocate to the US, where fast food culture and economics tend to dominate.

Curvace, a research group from Switzerland, is the latest to announce a compound eye invention with its Curved Artificial Compound Eye (CACE) prototype, made up of a strip of small cameras. Curvace is competing with a bug inspired camera system from the University of Illinois, which detailed its own compound eye system at the beginning of the month. Both systems aim to do the same thing — mimic the vision of a fly, which relies on compound eyes to track minuscule movements with a wider field-of-view and deeper depth of field than the human eye, or moden single camera setups, can even attempt to reach.  Two CACE devices side-by-side produce a 360-degree field of view Curvace's CACE prototype is built as a flattened strip about the size of a quarter, and promises 180-degree sight. Put two of the prototypes side-by-side, and a 360-degree field-of-view is possible, according to a report from IEEE Spectrum magazine. The Curvace prototype is also built to be flexible, allowing the strip of cameras to be bent over a curved surface. The University of Illinois compound camera setup performs similarly to what Curvace has come up with, but it does so by placing its cameras on a dome that has the rounded look of an eyeball. In a report published in the May issue of Nature, the university says its prototype, which is made up of 180 cameras working in unison, is similar in function to the eyes of moths, lobsters, and houseflies. Both inventions will likely have militaristic implications. The University of Illinois is funding its insect-inspired camera system, in part, with funding from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) — which has a well known interest in drones.

The cost covers an unplanned birth and social maintenance fee for the two children that the couple raised in violation of the country's one-child rules — Zhang and Chen have two sons and one daughter.

On February 5th, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence put out a public request for information, asking companies for input that could be integrated into the final proposal. Among other things, the request asks for information on achieving ""near real-time access"" to data from multiple phone companies, provide secure storage, and correlate records from different companies into a single searchable database. It also asks for input in creating ""rigorous"" standards for making sure agents can't make unauthorized searches ""while maintaining 99.9 percent availability.""

But looking at Tsarnaev’s case in light of Timothy McVeigh — the last person in the US to be executed on federal terrorism charges in 2001 — it becomes harder to believe that the 20-year-old’s crimes will rise to the level of a capital offense. As one McVeigh expert put it simply to The Verge: ""Tsarnaev is different.""  The stories of McVeigh and Tsarnaev have similarities. If the allegations against Tsarnaev are true, both he and McVeigh set off bombs at highly populated locations on United States soil, killing and wounding people. They both worked in secret, for months, with partners to produce those bombs. They were both charged under federal terrorism statutes for their crimes. Federal prosecutors in both cases decided death would be the only fair sentence if they were convicted. But the two cases are also very different. For one thing, their crimes took place in very different times. When McVeigh drove a rented Ryder truck along NW Fifth Street in downtown Oklahoma City and lit a two-minute fuse that would detonate 5,000 pounds of explosives and kill 168 people, no one was standing idly by with an iPhone to inadvertently record his movements. In the hours following the explosion at 9:03AM on April 19th, 1995, there were no amateur investigators glued to Reddit, trying to determine what McVeigh looked like or where he might be. The manhunts were comparatively brief (McVeigh was arrested about an hour after the bombings). There were no high-profile misidentifications in McVeigh’s case. Victims were relentless in pushing for McVeigh’s death And when it comes to whether Tsarnaev might face death, another major difference is his relationship to his alleged victims. Indiana University School of Law associate professor Jody Madeira is the author of Killing McVeigh: The Death Penalty and the Myth of Closure, which used 33 in-person interviews to deconstruct how Oklahoma City bombing victims reacted to McVeigh’s trial and execution. Madeira explains that victims play a huge role in whether an execution should occur. The victims in Boston, she says, seem to see Tsarnaev in a very different way than Oklahoma City’s victims saw McVeigh. Victims were relentless in pushing for McVeigh’s death, she explains. In part, that was because his crimes were revolting. But it was also because McVeigh became such a widely quoted personality. He gave numerous media interviews and even participated in an authorized biography from behind bars. McVeigh, who was a 27-year-old Gulf War Army veteran at the time of the bombings, saw his actions as a rational response to, among other events, the 1993 federal siege of the Branch Davidian complex outside Waco, Texas, in which 83 people were killed. He would share his rationale for the Oklahoma City bombing — a rationale that he saw as a kind of war declaration — to anyone who would listen. The victims weren’t interested in McVeigh’s politics, though. Instead, they saw the public, ongoing defense of his actions as the worst imaginable kind of nuisance. ""There was this sense among the victims that McVeigh was just always there, right in front of them on television or in the newspaper,"" Madeira says. Oklahoma City bombing victims had ""this involuntary relationship with McVeigh. These people wanted to silence him through execution."" Madeira attributes McVeigh’s visibility as much to media structure in the mid- to late-1990s as she does to McVeigh himself. ""These people wanted to silence him through execution."" ""The responsibilities of viewers were a lot different,"" she says. ""When McVeigh’s trial was happening in 1997, most people didn’t rely on the internet for news. They would turn on the evening [television] news or flip open the paper and McVeigh was just always there. Today, if there’s a story I don’t like, I can avoid it. I can choose not to view the headlines. It wasn’t like that then."" For that reason, she says — combined with Dzhokhar Tsarnaev’s thus far nonexistent attempts to plead his case publicly — victims won’t feel as though they’re in an involuntary relationship with Tsarnaev; they’ll be less likely to relentlessly push for his execution. ""McVeigh was convicted of killing people and came across as someone who would just as soon kill you, too, if it would help his cause,"" she said. Tsarnaev’s Rolling Stone cover image, the fact that he’s been weirdly seen as some kind of heartthrob, and his extremely limited attempts to speak publicly about his case so far only add to the unlikelihood that a jury might take take prosecutors’ advice and order Tsarnaev’s death. ""He doesn’t look dangerous,"" Madeira says. In 1997, Aitan D. Goelman was one of the federal prosecutors assigned to put McVeigh on trial. McVeigh may have been the last person to be executed in a federal terrorism case, he says, but the Department of Justice (DOJ) has gone after the death penalty in multiple cases — related to terror and otherwise — since it reinstated the death penalty in 1988. Since then, only three executions, including McVeigh’s, have been carried out. ""In every case, it’s an uphill battle for federal prosecutors,"" he says. And in Boston that hill may be steeper than most. A September Boston Globe poll found that 57 percent of Bostonians favored a life sentence for Tsarnaev instead of the death penalty. It’s unlikely, in other words, that they’ll call for his death. And unless there’s a change of venue, federal prosecutors fighting for Tsarnaev’s death will select jurors from that pool. On whether victims can influence a jury to opt for an execution, Goelman diverges from Madeira. The process is complicated, he says. While federal officials asked Boston bombing survivors to answer a questionnaire about their opinions on the death penalty, prosecutors’ choice to ask for an execution goes through a capital case review process, where officials meet and consider what might separate a case from the garden variety. Goelman points out that it took Attorney General Holder the better part of a year to announce that DOJ would seek the death penalty in Tsarnaev’s case. ""It’s an uphill battle for federal prosecutors."" ""When it comes down to it, McVeigh and Tsarnaev are very different people with very different cases,"" Goelman says. Though conspiracy theories persist about cover-ups and ignored evidence in the Oklahoma City bombings, McVeigh presented himself as — and was prosecuted as — a mastermind. At trial, Goelman says, ""McVeigh actually looked like he was enjoying himself."" There’s little evidence to predict that Tsarnaev will act similarly. Goelman sees Tsarnaev as closer to Terry Nichols, McVeigh’s co-conspirator. Nichols helped McVeigh construct the massive bombs used in Oklahoma City, but he was at home in Kansas when the bombs went off. Nichols showed remorse and vulnerability at trial. Prosecutors asked that Nichols receive the death penalty, but he was sentenced to life in prison instead. He’s now serving the rest of his days on ""Bomber’s Row"" at the federal penitentiary in Florence, Colorado. Goelman also compares Tsarnaev to Lee Boyd Malvo, the 17-year-old who partnered with John Allen Muhammad to carry out the Beltway sniper attacks. Though that wasn’t a federal case, the circumstances were similar: an older man guiding a younger man into mass murder. Muhammad was executed in Virginia in 2009; Malvo is serving six consecutive life sentences at Red Onion State Prison in Pound, Virginia. ""We’ll have to wait and find out how much of an independent actor [Tsarnaev] was,"" Goelman says. ""Was he under the control of his older brother? Was he making decisions on his own? This may be a case of a young kid who was very much a participant rather than a ringleader."" When Timothy McVeigh was executed, President George W. Bush gave a press conference announcing that a horrifying saga had finally concluded. ""Today every living person who was hurt by the evil done in Oklahoma City can rest in the knowledge that there has been a reckoning,"" the president said. ""Due process ruled. The case was proved. The verdict was calmly reached. And the rights of the accused were protected and observed to the full and to the end. Under the laws of our country, the matter is concluded."" Such statements almost seem quaint in retrospect. Three months after McVeigh was executed, 19 extremist Muslim terrorists crashed jets into the World Trade Center, the Pentagon, and a field outside Somerset, Pennsylvania. The war on terror was born, and along with it came not only a deepened, ongoing hatred of those who would launch attacks against innocent people on US soil, but also an added and persistent fear that the United States was under attack by extremist Muslims from all over the world. Though it can be argued that this fear of Muslims has subsided a bit, few would argue that it’s gone. And Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is Muslim. Among the evidence prosecutors undoubtedly plan to address at trial are messages he allegedly wrote inside the boat where he hid from swarms of police officers before his arrest. Among the messages: ""We Muslims are one body, you hurt one you hurt us all."" Could his faith inspire a hatred among jurors to replace whatever lenience they offer his looks or his role as a mere participant? Madeira doesn’t think so. At this point, she says, it’s difficult to connect Tsarnaev ""to al-Qaeda or any larger group."" That, too, could help keep Tsarnaev off death row. But as Goelman suggests: we’ll have to wait and find out.",0.561607732252378,0.43839226774762197,0.8271610065214716,1637,5.0983506414172268,779,6.2618741976893455,0,0,"Policy & Law, US & World, Report",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

France's privacy watchdog, the Commission Nationale de l'Informatique et des Libertés, fined Google for its 2012 privacy policy change, which allowed it to consolidate 60 privacy policies into one and combine data from individual users across its different services. The order handed down with the fine was very specific as to how the message should look: it should be placed on Google.fr right below the search buttons, and it should be written in an Arial typeface no smaller than 13 points. That's much larger than any fine-print, and placing the message on Google's classically pristine homepage would ensure that all users see it. ""This is something we've never seen before,"" Google representative Patrice Spinosi said during Thursday's hearing. ""Google has always maintained that page in a virgin state."" The company has asked a French court to suspend this order while it appeals the CNIL's decision and fine, but the CNIL insists that if Google can promote its own services on the homepage, it can also publish the news of the sanctions.  ""Google has always maintained that page in a virgin state."" This comes on the heels of Google tentatively settling an antitrust complaint with the EU about its search engine, but the company still has many spats to take care of regarding its privacy polices and payment of taxes. While Google remains under investigation by the UK, Germany, and others, France is the first country to require Google to notify users of sanctions in such an obvious way, and with such specific instructions on how to do so. However, messages like these are not uncommon — Apple was forced to publish a notice on its UK homepage after losing an appeal regarding Samsung tablet design. But after Apple added statements and tweaked the initial message's wording, it was later ruled ""false and misleading,"" landing Apple in more trouble with the UK and Samsung. France's instructions seem to be a small way for the country to stop Google from intentionally misleading users about the fine, but rather than using poetic license with the notification, Google doesn't want to post it at all. The WSJ reports that Google believes a message on its homepage could cause ""irreparable damage"" to the company's reputation. Even if the message is only required to be up for two days, Google seems to think that's still enough time for the company to be tarnished in the eyes of French users.",0.4344365460932046,0.5655634539067954,0.20013111526082572,445,4.9685393258426966,259,5.8571428571428568,0,0,"Google, Policy & Law, US & World",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

The good news: I found a movie that felt close to being ""mine,"" in that I felt that kind of heart-tugging urgency one feels after encountering a work of art that finds some little click of affinity inside you. It's a wild, slightly manic, not unpleasant feeling: you find yourself wandering in a loopy, Family Circus-esque trajectory as you leave the venue; you nearly text several people about your excitement before thinking better of it; you feel the need both to talk to someone immediately and to greedily horde the experience for yourself; you feel an inexplicable longing to live inside the good thing you just saw, or better yet, to somehow become it. Philosophical implications worthy of a Black Mirror Mother's Day special That was me, bumbling around the outside of the Library Center Theatre after the premiere screening of Advantageous. Jennifer Phang's second feature was the first sci-fi film I had seen at the festival, as well as the first genre film in general. It's a quiet, deliberately paced story of a woman, her daughter, and a medical procedure with philosophical implications worthy of a Black Mirror Mother's Day special. Gwen (Jacqueline Kim, who also co-wrote the film) is a spokeswoman for a new-fangled body-swapping procedure, who must undergo the procedure herself in order to keep her job and be able to ensure a good future for her daughter, Jules (Samantha Kim). It's moody and specific and is a rare sci-fi film to nail its human emotion — particularly the mother-daughter relationship at its center — just as expertly, if not more so, as its more lofty philosophical questions. And here was the conflict — I knew even before the lights came up that this film would not receive the three-minute-long standing ovation that Me, Earl and the Dying Girl had received at its premiere. Park City moms would not be gushing about it on the shuttle back to Main Street. Its dearth of recognizable stars (aside from perhaps Ken Jeong, who produced the film and has a small supporting role) would mean a dearth of press cameras on its red carpet and a proportional lack of pictweets from trade reporters. I can't point to any specific thing that made me sure of this (aside from the general persecution complex I tend to project onto things that I feel passionately about; don't worry, I'm completely self-aware about this particular maladjustment of mine) other than two things Advantageous had done to put itself at an, ahem, disadvantage. The thing that's crazy about this is that when you talk about Sundance bait, Advantageous has it all: compelling parental drama, a thoughtful inquiry into the role of women in modern society, the support / star power of someone who's been on Community. But it had to go and muck it up by having the gall to imagine a world outside our current day contemporary one; to lay out its moralistic dilemma on a stage of its own invention. Advantageous takes place in an unspecified American city (looks vaguely like Brooklyn, so that's another checkmark on the Sundance bait list) in the year 2041. It's a world where gleaming, Dubai-like towers extend toward the clouds, over-programmed school children practice meditation in bucolic public green spaces, and daily terrorist attacks have become commonplace — citizens look over their shoulders and shrug as another plume of smoke rises over the city. Aside from its unexplained scant population (a trope of the indie sci-fi; hordes of extras in future-couture are expensive), it's a terribly plausible future and, like any good speculative fiction, lets its world-building unravel like a kind of mystery that plays out over the first half. World-building that unravels like a mystery For lovers of science fiction, new fictional worlds are like delightful puzzles, and figuring out how they work and how they are similar or prophetic about our own is half the fun of watching a film or reading a book for the first time. But not every audience member approaches sci-fi like that. It seems contradictory at an ""indie"" film festival, but much of the Sundance audience does not care to go along for a ride that they don't fully and immediately understand (unless Kristen Wiig is involved). A kind of familiarity is key, which of course is different than pleasantness — the faintest whiff of something sordid or edgy (but not unheard-of) is something Sundance audiences perennially get off on, like so many Sorel boot-wearing moths to a heat lamp. Alexander Skarsgard copulating with a 15-year-old? Bring it on. Hovercrafts in the background? Cringe. Building a sci-fi premise is more like registering a patent than getting a script optioned It is fair and logical that science fiction is evaluated by a different yardstick than standard dramatic films; building and conceiving of one is more like registering a patent than getting a script optioned. You've got to be first in your area of expertise — sorry, anyone who wants to do a Technological Singularity film after Transcendence — but it also has to function well enough to scare away imitators (and even then, you may never be safe — it took over a decade, but a small wave of Primer clones is finally upon us.) For so many people, that yardstick for science fiction exists arbitrarily below the human-interest drama, instead of parallel to it. And when a film like Advantageous comes along and manages to score high on both scales, oftentimes nobody's checking for it.   I had an urge — the type I almost never get — to go up to Phang after the screening and tell her how much I appreciated her film; maybe that accounted for my loopy freestyle walking. It wouldn't be a conversation; I'd just tell her how much I admired its assured pacing, its matter-of-fact brand of dystopia, its unshowy dedication to the uniquely female struggle of its protagonist. Aside from all that, it was terribly exciting to see a film full of Asian-American actors presented to us without explanation or apology. As Jules, Samantha Kim in particular struck me as an incredibly promising young talent; convincingly whip-smart, yet depressive and insecure in a way that anyone who's ever been a 13-year-old girl can identify with. Even now, I can barely think about the relationship between Gwen and Jules without getting emotional, something I can't say for the myriad fictional relationship constructs that have been presented to me on screen this week. And that's even before Gwen has her brain cloned into a new body. I sincerely hope Advantageous is able to find a distribution deal that will grant it a bigger audience — an online audience perhaps, more open-minded about its kind of world-building. But more than its choice of genre or the ethnicity of its cast, I fear something even stupider may stand in the film's way: water. Specifically, the thoroughly B-grade CGI water that appears in two different establishing shots of futuristic, waterfall-adorned architecture. The mere possibility that all of Advantageous' rich ideas and emotions could be undercut by a few seconds of sub-par CGI fills one with a different kind of dystopian despair, but I'm also hard-pressed to think of a much more apt metaphor for contemporary Hollywood.",0.6575184608657598,0.3424815391342402,0.18642492720796458,1229,4.9853539462978027,648,6.3888888888888893,0,2,"Culture, Entertainment, Film",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

As the revolution intensified in Syria and neighboring countries, so did their relationship, and Amina's blog — A Gay Girl In Damascus — gained international attention. But then Amina goes missing and Sandra — and the rest of the world — begin to learn the truth of her identity. The Amina Profile, a documentary by Canadian filmmaker Sophie Deraspe premiering at this year's Sundance Film Festival, follows that investigation. Deraspe's film uses the sheer bizarreness of the story as a means to talk about sensationalism, stereotypes, and the shortcomings of both old and new media in the midst of an unprecedented revolution. Sophie, tell me a little bit about how you came to know Sandra and began to uncover this story. Sophie: I knew Sandra before [I began the documentary], so I was aware that she had met this amazing Syrian American woman. We weren't close friends, so I wasn't aware of the level of intimacy. But I knew her, so I was aware of the online dating, and Amina starting the blog, and then the abduction and the investigation into who was behind Amina. But I have to say, I think if I had not been a friend [I wouldn't have known] — because I remember having heard on the news only a few glimpses. And that's what we were hearing from people, that they kind of heard about Amina, but they don't know the story, to the extent that we present in the film. It rings a bell to many people, but not much more than that. ""It just felt right to be attracted to Amina."" Sandra, when you began talking with Amina, how much did her involvement with the Syrian revolution impact your emotional investment in the relationship?    Sandra: Well, most of my friends [nicknamed] me ""Marjane,"" the illustrator of Persepolis. It's a graphic novel about a young girl who was raised in Tehran, and she's always outspoken and always wants to have a revolution. And for me, meeting someone who fit that profile was very exciting. She was standing up for her beliefs, and she was really fearless. And that was like, ""Oh my god, this is crazy beautiful,"" you know? It adds a sexy value to the profile of the person. I am a very curious person, and I was always interested in the Middle East, [partly because of] my family's roots there. It just felt right to be attracted to Amina.   But throughout the relationship, even as it got very intimate, you never were able to use video to communicate? Sandra: No. Skype was blocked in Syria, and in some parts more than others. So for me, it totally made sense that we couldn't Skype. That probably seems very convenient, in retrospect. Sandra: Well at that moment, it was a war zone, and you have to understand also that [the Syrian government was] blocking the internet. Sometimes the internet was down, sometimes the internet was up — you never knew what was going on. I had done some research on the web and saw that Skype was blocked in Syria, and so was the internet, because they only wanted the regime to have internet access. So it was convenient, but it also made sense at the time. Sophie: Sandra gave me all her archives with Amina. She did not want to go through it all again. But I read it all, and you know, now she may seem pretty naïve, since she conducted this six-month-long relationship without having actually heard a voice or seen an image on video. But it all made sense when the uprising started and the country was under this dictatorship. And Sandra tried a lot of times to reach Amina in different ways, but Amina was very clever in always adding a new chapter in her adventure, her story. So let's say Sandra finally got a phone number to phone Amina. Amina says ""Okay, you can call me tonight, I'll be home."" She calls, but there's someone [she doesn't know] speaking Arabic on the other end. She hangs up, writes ""hey I tried to call you, but I don't know who it was,"" and Amina just says ""I had to escape Damascus, the secret police came for me, and now I'm hiding in a village."" Things like that. How many times did that happen? Sandra: With the phone number? Only once. Sophie: Only once. But then, as you know, The Guardian published an interview with Amina with a pseudonymous journalist in Damascus. And [one would assume,] reading this interview, that this pseudonymous journalist had met with Amina. Sandra: In all honesty, I had doubts. But when a big international publication like The Guardian said that they had met Amina and conducted an interview, my doubts were washed away. I was like, okay, someone met her — Sophie: Someone can vouch for her. Sandra: — It seemed like a stamp of approval. It speaks to our knee-jerk trust in old media organizations, even in a new media world. We see a headline in The Guardian, or The New York Times, and we never think to question it. Sophie: Exactly. And it wasn't only Sandra who trusted The Guardian, but so many journalists from around the world who didn't fact check the story. Sandra: So for me it was like, okay, I had doubts, but maybe I shouldn't have doubts. Sophie: And you begin to feel bad when you have doubts about a person who is going through so much. Sandra: And you don't exactly know the dynamic, because you're not under siege, you're not at war. So the Guardian post made it easy for me to keep on believing. ""YOU BEGIN TO FEEL BAD ABOUT DOUBTING A PERSON WHO IS GOING THROUGH SO MUCH."" The Arab Spring is often referred to as the first revolutionary movement aided by social media. That's usually seen as a positive thing — young people using modern technology to incite social change — but this story also shows some of the drawbacks of so much unvetted information being out there for public consumption. Sophie: Well, we were first misled by traditional media, even if Amina was operating with social media for her personal relationship as well as her blog. We're not demonizing social media. It's there, it's useful for a lot of people, and in the film we show how important it was for Syrian activists, and also how necessary it is for them to hide their identity. It has always been the case, even before social media, that some sources have to stay anonymous. But there always is a way of proving that the source is credible. With social media it should be the same. But it takes time, and the thing is that today we want the news out very, very quickly. Not only in social media, but in traditional media as well — they don't want to be behind. I guess they feel they are already behind social media, so they're trying to keep the pace. I do want to talk about Tom McMasters, the American graduate student who is ultimately revealed to be behind Amina's online persona. To me, there was something fascinating about a white straight male using the identity of a gay Syrian woman to feel heard, or important, in the midst of this revolution. Sophie: It's fascinating because it has many levels. He wanted a voice, to be listened to — because he had opinions about Syria, about the Middle East. And he had extraordinary timing in starting a blog just a few weeks before the first uprisings in Syria. But then there's this intimate relationship he conducted [with Sandra] as a lesbian. So it's not only a way to find a voice, it's more complex than that. Social media has allowed a lot of people who feel that they don't have mainstream sexuality or a mainstream opinion, to find other people like them, and that is great. But in this case, there's a lot we can [potentially] extrapolate. I don't know if he's uncomfortable in his male body; or if he is, and he's just exploiting female sexuality. Or if he is somehow uncomfortable as an American male. I don't know. What was your impression, Sandra, when you finally confronted him? Sandra: Well, you know, there was apprehension. You see in the documentary — I was crying, I was super upset, and crying for him, in a way. Because I had given him so much of myself already, I [had been] totally transparent. But I have to say that the apprehension, the anxiety of meeting someone you don't know — because it's not really the same person — as soon as the door opened and I actually met him, I relaxed. I was just like, okay, now is my time to have this interview on my own terms. I was controlling the situation, which felt very good because [at that point] I had totally lost control of the situation. [Sophie and I] were there on a mission, but we didn't know what was going to happen. So for me it was very important that I had the pleasure, in a way, of being the one who was asking questions, being the one who was facing him. At the end, there was real closure. In the documentary, we left the door open for any perception, any judgement that the public could have. Because I have my own, and Sophie has her own, but it was important for us to just leave it up to the audience to [choose to] understand or not understand what he did. But for me, I got what I was looking for. And I'm going to move on. There have obviously been multiple high-profile incidents like this in the past couple years — Manti Te'o, the popularity of MTV's Catfish. Why do you think this story in particular needs to be told — what can we learn from it? Sophie: Well, [in The Amina Profile,] not only one person was fooled. Many people were — many educated people, many people who know about the world and the media. So there's a synchronicity that is pretty amazing and raises issues in our contemporary world about online identity and media coverage. And how Syrians do need a voice and maybe don't get the representation from the media that they are supposed to get. So it starts at a very intimate level and it goes to a very broad, sociopolitical level. It's kind of amazing to have that all in one story. ""Amina is a mirror of our own perception and fantasies."" Sandra: It's a very different story from Catfish, because it's showing us our weaknesses for cliché. The media, myself, and other people were fooled because it was such a perfect formula. We were like, ""Oh, this seems beautiful, let's [follow this story]."" It's really about how we in Western countries perceive the Middle East, and stereotypes that we all have that we should totally revise. Sophie: The film is constructed and conducted in a way so that the viewer would experience the fantasy that we shared, the fantasy that started between Sandra and Amina, but then that was spread and shared [across the internet.] This fantasy of a woman — a cute, outspoken lesbian, in a country where women are supposed to be covered and submissive. Amina is a mirror of our own perception and fantasies, and how exotic and unknown the Middle East still is for many of us.

Researchers involved in the study, which will be published this week in Nature Climate Change, say that this is one of the most comprehensive city-specific studies conducted so far, with combined data from all seasons and application of multiple climate scenarios. ""This serves as a reminder that heat events are one of the greatest hazards faced by urban populations around the globe,"" climate scientist and coauthor Radley Horton said. The results add another data point to an overwhelming body of evidence that suggests the Earth's changing climate will pose a threat to human life in the coming decades. Earlier this year, climate scientists at NASA ranked 2012 as the ninth-warmest year since 1880, when annual temperatures were first recorded. (NASA's findings also indicated that the ten hottest years in this period have all occurred since 1998.) Scientists and climate advocates have worked to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, pegged as a key agitator of climate change, for many years. Recently, warnings have come from unexpected places; earlier this year, US national security advisor Tom Donilon said that climate change is a national security threat. Manhattan faces unique challenges as a densely populated urban area According to the new study from Columbia, Manhattan faces unique challenges as a densely populated area, with the increase in average monthly temperatures outpacing global and US trends. The study attributes this change in part to the fact that buildings and pavement in cities concentrate heat, absorbing it during the day and releasing it at night. The study projects that Manhattan will continue to see steep average increases in temperature: ""3.3 to 4.2 degrees Fahrenheit more by the 2050s, and 4.3 to 7.1 degrees by the 2080s."" To calculate death estimates, researchers applied temperature projections from 16 global climate models — downscaling them to Manhattan — against two scenarios: one with rapid population growth and minimal efforts to limit emissions, and another assuming slower growth and a decrease in emissions by 2040 due to technological advancements. In both scenarios, the study projects that heat-related deaths will rise in the 2020s. Deaths are projected to be worse in May and September — periods the researchers say ""will probably increasingly become incorporated into the brutal dog days of summer.""",0.7862873240376197,0.2137126759623803,0.8259041352914704,413,5.3510895883777243,252,6.2976190476190474,0,0,Science,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

All of the Arctic’s sea ice is expected to melt completely, every summer, beginning around 2050 or sooner, according to one recent study, clearing the way for unprecedented oil and gas drilling. But oil companies and world governments aren’t waiting until then to spur an oil boom in the Arctic — they’re starting now.  Just this week, the Arctic Council, an intergovernmental group made up of the US and seven other countries that share the Arctic border, met in Kiruna, Sweden, and announced a new agreement to cooperate on Arctic oil spill response. ""That’s an important framework for cooperation in the event of an emergency,"" said US Secretary of State John Kerry ahead of the signing. ""And as the United States was reminded painfully in the Gulf of Mexico three years ago, we need strong partnerships and shared operational guidelines before a disaster occurs in order to make sure that we’re able to respond."" ""we need strong partnerships and shared operational guidelines before a disaster occurs."" Oil companies note they have already been operating in the Arctic for decades, but this has mostly been focused on exploration, surveying, and other research to prepare for drilling. Oil companies first attempted to drill in the Canadian portion of the Arctic in the 1970s and '80s, but found the terrain difficult and the supply of oil insufficient to justify the risks and costs. Photo of Shell's drilling rig Kulluk grounded off Alaskan island in early 2013. (Credit: US Coast Guard Petty Officer 1st Class Sara Francis.) Actual drilling beyond the initial attempts in the Canadian Arctic has been slow to come in part due to court filings by wildlife conservation groups which seek to halt initial developments over environmental concerns. Despite that, there have already been several oil industry-related disasters in the Arctic, albeit minor ones. Royal Dutch Shell (better known as Shell in the US) saw one of its Alaskan offshore rigs drift dangerously close to shore and suffer an engine fire in 2012, while the company’s other Alaskan drilling rig ran aground off an uninhabited island on New Year’s Eve this year and was damaged, though no fuel was reported leaked. The incidents, combined with regulatory scrutiny by the US government, prompted Shell to halt its Alaskan offshore oil drilling plans for at least the rest of this year.  Still, ""Shell remains committed to building an Arctic exploration program that provides confidence to stakeholders and regulators,"" said Marvin Odum, director of Shell’s Upstream Americas division, in a statement. ""Shell remains committed to building an Arctic exploration program."" Meanwhile, the Arctic Council’s new oil spill cleanup agreement has been heralded as something of a coming of age for the group, which was founded in 1996 largely as a symbolic organization. In recent years though, the Council has taken on far more serious auspices, enacting legally-binding international agreements to cooperate on Arctic search and rescue in 2011, and, this year, on oil pollution. Despite what would seem to be the Council’s proactive move to deal with what would seem to be an inevitable emergency in the Arctic, environmentalists warn that this year’s agreement could further facilitate the destruction of animal habitats and the indigenous communities who call the region home. Map showing oil company Statoil's developments in the Arctic. (Credit: Statoil.) ""This agreement is so vaguely written that it will have very little practical value in increasing the level of preparedness for an oil spill,"" said Ben Ayliffe, head of conservation group Greenpeace International’s Arctic Oil division, in an email to The Verge. ""If this is the best the Arctic Council can do after years of work, then heaven help us."" ""The Arctic is the defining environmental battle of the early 21st century."" Greenpeace advocates protested the Arctic Council’s latest meeting on May 14 and 15, by organizing a rival conference, The People’s Arctic, which was designed to rally indigenous Arctic communities to oppose the unrestricted economic development of the Arctic’s vast oil and mineral resources by multibillion-dollar corporations. The Arctic is estimated to hold between 13 percent and 25 percent of the world’s undiscovered oil deposits, and up to 30 percent of its undiscovered natural gas deposits, according to estimates by governments and oil companies.  ""The Arctic is the defining environmental battle of the early 21st century and Greenpeace aren’t going to stop until we’ve won,"" Ayliffe said.

""Continuing to responsibly develop Arctic oil and gas resources aligns with the United States ‘all of the above’ approach to developing new domestic energy sources,"" reads a key line in the new US National Strategy for the Arctic Region released by the White House last week. For environmentalists, the new US strategy seems odd, given the Obama administration’s messy experience dealing with the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010, and its general opposition to other prominent oil projects at lower latitudes, like the Keystone XL pipeline. At worst, it smacks of an outright betrayal of President Obama’s stated commitment to cutting down on US fossil fuel emissions. ""Continuing to responsibly develop Arctic oil and gas resources aligns with the United States ‘all of the above’ approach."" ""It’s certainly strange seeing President Obama making such strong statements on finally tackling global climate change, but then opening up the frozen north — the one place that is warming faster than anywhere else on the planet and where sea ice is entering what scientists are calling a ‘death spiral’ — to the oil industry,"" Greenpeace’s Ayliffe said. More broadly, the entire Arctic Council is in many ways at odds with itself. The eight members on the Council — Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden and Russia — each vary fairly widely when it comes to the relative size and power of their domestic oil industries, as well as their support for alternative energy. The government of Sweden, for example, committed to establishing an ""oil-free"" economy in 2006, but was ousted by another government that does not support this plan. Canada, once a beacon of environmentalism, has seen wide expansion of oil and gas development under its conservative Harper government. But the newly elected government of Greenland, which is considered part of Denmark for the purposes of the Council, recently enacted a moratorium on new offshore oil and gas drilling licenses in Arctic waters.

Russia tried to assert a claim over the North Pole in 2007 Complicating matters is the fact that the Arctic territorial claims of each of these countries, which oil companies need to lease, are disputed. Russia tried to assert a claim over the North Pole in 2007, but Denmark and Norway also say they own a part of it, and there are numerous rival claims to Arctic waters. While small diplomatic skirmishes have broken out and been resolved, there have yet to be any serious conflicts. Going forward, the US and other Arctic Council countries have said they want to preserve that status quo, but this will surely become harder as oil and gas companies ramp up their developments. For environmentalists, the forecast for the future of the Arctic appears grim, but they have latched on to one recent silver lining: oil companies running into serious technological and regulatory challenges to drilling the Arctic. Since Shell announced its pause in Arctic drilling earlier this year, competitors Statoil and ConocoPhillips have both paused or adjusted their Arctic oil development timelines, many citing variations of ""regulatory uncertainty.""  Other oil companies are looking to Russia, where the regulations are less strict, but getting approval there could still take years. ""If we’d have believed the oil industry five years ago we’d now be witnessing a massive boom in the Arctic oil industry,"" Ayliffe said. ""We were told it was inevitable, just a matter of time. But that hasn’t been the case and many companies have had their fingers burnt ... The technical challenges remain extraordinary. No one has found a way of cleaning up oil spilled in ice.""",0.5061439885935994,0.49385601140640056,0.846681208884378,1431,5.2403913347309574,707,6.6011315417256009,0,0,"Policy & Law, Science, Report",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The assessment comes from the Republican side of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. “Weaknesses in the federal government’s own cybersecurity have put at risk the electrical grid, our financial markets, our emergency response systems and our citizens’ personal information,” said Republican Tom Coburn. It starts off with some examples of recent missteps, including the fake zombie apocalypse emergency alert that went out in Montana last year. Other mistakes have been more worrisome; last year, a hacker made off with private information on all 85,000 dams inside the US — including data revealing their condition and the potential for fatalities if they were breached or destroyed. Sensitive cybersecurity plans for nuclear plants have been left unprotected on shared drives. ""Those failures aren’t due to poor practices by the private sector,"" reads the report. ""All of the examples below were real lapses by the federal government."" Government agencies are still terrible at updating software The report pulls from over 40 audits of government agencies and other internal reviews. And just every major department in the federal government has failed to boost cybersecurity to a satisfactory level. The Department of Homeland Security, which is supposed to be leading the charge in locking down critical data, isn't setting a very good example. The DHS has failed to ""update basic software like Microsoft applications, Adobe Acrobat and Java, the sort of basic security measure just about any American with a computer has performed,"" the report says. Out-of-date antivirus software, weak passwords, and sloppy physical security (sensitive passwords were found written on desks) were among other problems. Employees are picking 'lousy' passwords Things fare even worse at the Nuclear Regulatory Committee. The report points to an alarming ""general lack of confidence"" in the NRC’s IT department that has prompted some offices to ""go rogue"" by buying their own computers and networks. The NRC also reportedly has trouble keeping track of its laptop computers — which often have access to sensitive information. Perhaps more concerning, the NRC recognizes some of these problems, but routinely fails in resolving them. ""Problems were identified but never scheduled to be fixed; fixes were scheduled but not completed; fixes were recorded as complete when they were not,"" the report says. Moving to the financial side, the report claims that the IRS often fails to encrypt sensitive data and that the agency is ""dangerously slow"" in implementing critical software updates. Employees also use ""lousy"" passwords, and the IRS has been receiving warnings about these lackluster logins for six years now. Some employees at the Securities and Exchange Commission have stored crucial data on unencrypted laptops — including what amounts to a how-to guide on hacking into the stock exchanges. The report also points out shortcomings at the Department of Energy and Department of Education; you can read it in full here. Coburn said the report is yet more proof that ""Congress needs to hold the White House and its agencies accountable.”",0.1503276917015442,0.8496723082984559,0.8233238338644724,514,5.4961089494163424,312,6.4038461538461542,0,0,"Policy & Law, US & World",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

It’s a modern airport,'"" Biden said. International airports have indeed seen some stunning innovations recently. ""If I took you and blindfolded you and took you to LaGuardia Airport in New York, you'd think, ‘I must be in some third-world country,’"" Biden said. When his statement drew laughter from the crowd, Biden quickly noted, ""I'm not joking."" To further illustrate just how bad things have become, he pointed to statistics from the World Economic Forum. ""Just in the last decade, the United States has fallen 20 spots when it comes to the quality of infrastructure,"" Biden said. ""It's embarrassing, and it's stupid. It's stupid."" ""That puts us literally behind, they rank us behind Barbados,"" Biden said. ""Great country. One airport."" Biden's remarks came during the unveiling of Amtrak's newest rail engine. ""Why did we lead the world economically for so long? We had the most modern infrastructure in the world,"" he said. Despite being one of the most popular airports in the world, LaGuardia is often criticized by travelers for its dated or ""unique"" facilities. In fact, another public figure has used Biden's exact language in the past. In 2011, during an appearance on CNN, Donald Trump ridiculed the facility. ""You land your plane at LaGuardia Airport, you go to LaGuardia Airport, it's like a third-world airport,"" Trump said. ""This country is a laughing stock throughout the world.""

The Secret Science Reform Act of 2014 is meant to allow independent scientists to verify the data behind environmental regulations, creating more accountability for the agency. It's also a way for the agency's opponents to create more barriers to regulation and attempt to discredit environmental policies. ""Virtually every regulation proposed by the Obama administration has been justified by nontransparent data and unverifiable claims,"" writes House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology Chair Lamar Smith (R-TX), who is also a sponsor of the bill. ""The American people foot the bill for EPA's costly regulations, and they have a right to see the underlying science."" The bill is short, but it's also fairly broad. Before proposing or finalizing any regulation, hazard assessment, standard, or piece of guidance, the EPA must ""specifically identify"" each piece of scientific or technical information that it's relying on, then make that data public in a way that lets outsiders independently analyze and attempt to reproduce the results. That technical information includes not only data points but analysis and ""detailed descriptions"" of how to access and use the information. Obama has already told agencies to make any federally funded research freely available to the public, and it's not clear how dramatically this would change current practice; the EPA did not immediately return a request for comment. Obama's EPA has made mitigating and preparing for climate change a priority, and it's done so in part by placing new regulations on things like coal plants. This hasn't sat well with Congress members who are both opposed to environmental regulation generally and dubious that climate change even exists or is caused by humans. Though it's not raised explicitly in the bill, Smith has expressed skepticism over the issue, and his fellow chair and co-sponsor David Schweikert (R-AZ) says his bill is necessary to stop the EPA from making policy based on ""the whims of far-left environmental groups."" The agency, he says, has created regulations that ""placed a crippling financial burden on economic growth in this country with no public evidence to justify their actions.""",0.600786052231552,0.399213947768448,0.8771417684668098,371,5.4097035040431267,235,6.4638297872340429,0,0,"Policy & Law, US & World",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

While Google, Facebook, and others have reached a deal with the US government to break out national security requests in broad numbers, but Twitter wasn't one of the companies involved, and it says such numbers aren't useful for its purposes. ""Allowing Twitter, or any other similarly situated company, to only disclose national security requests within an overly broad range seriously undermines the objective of transparency,"" writes policy manager Jeremy Kessel, though he says the compromise is a step in the right direction. The company echoed a common refrain: by placing overly strict limits on talking about national security, the government is preventing it from reassuring users about how little information it's actually asked to give up. Kessel said that Twitter should be able to not only disclose how many accounts it receives but also tell users that it hasn't received certain types of requests. Apple, Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, Facebook, and LinkedIn have all settled their complaints with the government, but Kessel says Twitter is still pushing for more transparency. If the Department of Justice doesn't respond, it may go to court, arguing that NSA and FBI gag orders are a violation of its First Amendment rights. This tack has been taken in other cases, but so far, it's been largely unsuccessful. The US still tops the list for information requests The information Twitter has published in its report, which covers the second half of 2013, shows an increase in overall government requests for account information worldwide. In its first transparency report, covering the first half of 2012, Twitter noted 849 total requests. By the first half of 2013, that number had risen to 1,157, and now it sits at 1,410. Most online services have seen steady increases in requests, although some of that is likely due to an overall increase in accounts. The majority of requests in late 2013 — 833 — came from the US; about 70 percent of those requests were honored by Twitter. As Twitter notes, though, these numbers don't include classified national security requests. Saudi Arabia, which made 110 orders, and Japan, which made 213, were the only other countries to break the hundred-request mark, and most of those weren't actually honored. These numbers don't necessarily reflect how many accounts were specified, since multiple requests can be made on one account and multiple accounts can be specified in one request. By that metric, though, US and Japan still topped the list.   Requests to remove illegal content like libel or other prohibited speech jumped massively in late 2013, but that's due almost entirely to one country: France. A series of racist and anti-Semitic tweets sparked a minor firestorm in mid-2013, and Twitter received 306 takedown requests from the government, ultimately removing 133 tweets. France also asked for the third-highest number of account disclosures, and Twitter ended up providing information on about a quarter of the 102 specified accounts after a lengthy court battle.",0.48224652779777455,0.5177534722022255,0.18884810295598178,504,5.2222222222222223,292,5.9520547945205475,0,0,"Policy & Law, US & World",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

Five members of the group wearing balaclavas and bright dresses jumped around and fist-pumped in between services at Moscow's Cathedral of Christ the Savior as they sang a punk song about Putin, feminism, and gay rights. The entire performance lasted fewer than two minutes. The women were escorted out by security, a video was posted on YouTube, and they thought that would be it. The Russian government retaliated, however, and Tolokonnikova and Alyokhina became scapegoats. They suffered through a trial in a kangaroo court and were sentenced to two years in Russian prison, a grim fate that includes sewing police uniforms for 16 hours a day and being subjected to humiliation by guards during the one day a week set aside for bathing. An amnesty bill prompted by the upcoming Winter Olympics in Sochi triggered their release in December, a whole three months early. Now, they're touring the world to speak out about political prisoners and gay rights in Russia, and to encourage a boycott of the Sochi games. Tolokonnikova and Alyokhina are not well-liked by the Russian public, but to an American sensibility they present as intelligent, poised, and funny. Their message is especially compelling now that horror stories about gay discrimination in Russia have begun to make their way back to the West. The US is at a point where Occupy Wall Street has come and gone, Miley Cyrus' antics pass for controversy, and states are legalizing gay marriage and marijuana. ""It seems to me that there is a hold of complacency, really,"" Geldof said during a press conference before the show. ""It's easy to stand up in America."" Pussy Riot represents the punk-rock antiestablishment ethos that hasn't been felt in the US in a long time. But already the punker-than-thou debate has started up. Other members of Pussy Riot, which reportedly had around 11 members during the cathedral stunt, published a letter that says Tolokonnikova and Alyokhina are no longer members of the group. They took particular exception to the concert because of its expensive tickets, use of a man in a balaclava on the poster, and furthering of the ""cult of personality."" ""The mixing of the rebel feminist punk image with the image of institutionalized defenders of prisoners' rights, is harmful for us as a collective,"" they wrote. Tolokonnikova and Alyokhina may not be punk rock enough for their former associates, but the US hasn't seen anything like them in a while. They're also bringing negative attention on Putin at a very sensitive time. The world is looking to Russia right now as the Winter Olympics begin in Sochi, and the initial impressions are not good. As if journalists tweeting about stray dogs in their decrepit, half-built hotels wasn't enough to embarrass perennial President Vladimir Putin, the leader now has to contend with Tolokonnikova and Alyokhina goading him to leave from across the globe. When asked to speak rhetorically to Putin, Alyokhina smiled. ""Aren't you sick of it all?"" she said. The concert peaked with the entrance of Madonna, who experienced Russia's institutional discrimination against gays firsthand. Eighty-seven members of her audience were arrested at a show in St. Petersburg for ""displaying gay behavior,"" and she herself was sued for $1 million for ""promoting homosexuality."" Tolokonnikova and Alyokhina were not there to perform. After embracing Madonna, they read the defiant statements of Russian prisoners who are slated to be sentenced this month for being present at a protest in May of 2012. ""The truth will always win, even if it dies in battle,"" Tolokonnikova said via a translator. Then the women thanked the crowd and exited the stage so Imagine Dragons could play. Nadezhda Tolokonnikova, 24, and Maria Alyokhina, 25, at a press conference. The women spent 21 months in prison after singing a punk song in Moscow's Cathedral of Christ the Savior as part of a demonstration by the feminist collective Pussy Riot. Lediona Zharku, Elona Zharku, and Fiona Arifi, all 14, volunteer for Amnesty International. They're excited to see Imagine Dragons but haven't heard much about Pussy Riot. ""I think they're Russian?"" Elona says. ""They went to jail because they rebelled against society,"" Lediona says. Members of the Russian-Speaking American LGBT Association, also known as RUSA LGBT, show support for Pussy Riot outside the show. The next morning, they held a protest at the Russian consulate to draw attention to laws that criminalize homosexuality. A Vladimir Putin supporter stands outside shouting, ""Putin, yes! Pussy Riot, no!"" He noted that the Russian president has sheltered Edward Snowden, and expressed frustration that the US government encourages fear of Russia and China. Imagine Dragons played a short set, as did Lauryn Hill, The Fray, Blondie, Cake, Wayne Coyne of The Flaming Lips, and others. Blondie pumped up the crowd with a three-song set that opened with ""One Way or Another"" and closed with ""Call Me."" Pussy Riot has become fragmented after three of its members were outed, and the collective says Tolokonnikova and Alyokhina are no longer members. Amnesty International still showed this video of two women in bright dresses and balaclavas, the uniform of Pussy Riot. Madonna introduced the two activists and encouraged the audience to boo Putin. She played a show in St. Petersburg shortly after the Pussy Riot arrest and her show was condemned as a ""gay show,"" 87 attendees were arrested for ""displaying gay behavior,"" and she herself was sued for $1 million. Alyokhina and Tolokonnikova did not perform, instead reading statements from political prisoners who were arrested during a demonstration in May of 2012, who are set to be sentenced this month.",0.6385216020933854,0.3614783979066146,0.8721755312143724,1105,5.122171945701357,555,6.2972972972972974,0,18,"Culture, US & World, Photo Essay, Report",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

The Canadian industrial act Skinny Puppy has sent a bill for $666,000 to the US Department of Defense and is also investigating ways to bring a potential lawsuit against the government if it doesn't pay up. ""We sent them an invoice for our musical services considering they had gone ahead and used our music without our knowledge and used it as an actual weapon against somebody,"" bandmember Cevin Key told CTV News. The band was alerted to its music being used for torture by a former guard who was also a Skinny Puppy fan. ""I think he was coming at it from the fact that he was shocked that our music was being used,"" said Key, ""because although he was a guard at Guantanamo Bay, he also happened to be a fan of our music."" Originally, the band considered designing an album cover out of an invoice to the government, but eventually decided to send an actual invoice and potentially consider a full lawsuit. Skinny Puppy is just the latest in a long string of bands who have taken issue with the US government using their music for torture. In late 2008, Trent Reznor said that ""it's difficult for me to imagine anything more profoundly insulting, demeaning and enraging than discovering music you've put your heart and soul into creating has been used for purposes of torture"" after it was revealed Nine Inch Nails music was being used in Guantanamo Bay. A year later, NIN and other acts including REM, Pearl Jam, Rage Against the Machine, and others campaigned to try and have the infamous detention center closed down.

Reports range from broken heating units and dirty tap water to missing trash cans, but Sochi guests may have something more important to worry about than a hastily thrown-together hotel room: their own privacy. Dmitry Kozak, a Russian deputy prime minister in charge of preparations for the Olympics, mistakenly revealed during a press conference that at least some hotel guests are under video surveillance in their own bathrooms. ""We have surveillance video from the hotels that shows people turn on the shower, direct the nozzle at the wall and then leave the room for the whole day,"" the official told members of the press, according to The Wall Street Journal. Kozak was attempting to argue that foreign journalists were biased against Russia and were intentionally working to paint the Sochi games as a disaster. But in the process, he may have just spooked everyone assigned hotel rooms to attend the games. The Wall Street Journal reports that an aide quickly diverted the conversation and prevented any follow-up questions concerning bathroom video surveillance. ""We have surveillance video from the hotels..."" But such heavy-handed surveillance was expected in Sochi, which has turned into the most expensive Olympics of all. Terrorist threats are a top concern, and in response Russia has deployed a so-called ""ring of steel"" around the city to protect it. Reports recently said that part of the efforts include surveillance on athletes, journalists, and other guests, and it now seems that may include video cameras that keep tabs on visitors in their rooms. Considering other reports that Russian intelligence agencies have backdoor access to Wi-Fi connections, it will be hard to keep anything a secret in Sochi — even what you're singing in the shower. Update: A spokesperson for Kozak has now offered another take on the Russian official's statement. The Wall Street Journal reports that the spokesperson says there is no surveillance of occupied hotel rooms or bathrooms. He suggests that the footage Kozak referred to was captured while the hotels were being built and cleaned in preparation for the games. It's unclear how or why a visitor would be inside a hotel room and turning on a shower during this period of time.",0.5735154284938473,0.4264845715061527,0.8460863144217875,390,5.1333333333333337,233,6.0214592274678109,0,0,"US & World, National Security",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

There’s the subject matter: transgender prostitutes working in a not-so glamorous part of Hollywood. And there are the characters: flinty, funny, nobody’s victim. But the story behind the camera is as surprising as what’s in front of it. Particularly because the camera used to shoot Tangerine was the iPhone 5S. ""It was surprisingly easy."" Plenty of amateur films have been shot using iPhones, but by all reports, this is the first movie at the Sundance Film Festival to be shot almost entirely on an Apple device. It was a decision that indie writer and director Sean Baker made to accommodate the film’s small budget. But you’d never guess the camera, to look at it: Tangerine was shot in a widescreen, 2:35:1 aspect ratio, and its camera zooms through the streets of LA with a fluidity you’d never expect from a handheld device. And yet despite his camera of choice, Baker says the iPhone made for a good partner. ""It was surprisingly easy,"" Baker says. ""We never lost any footage."" So how do you make a Sundance movie for iPhone? You need four things. First, of course, the iPhone (Baker and his team used three). Second, an $8 app called Filmic Pro that allowed the filmmakers fine-grained control over the focus, aperture, and color temperature. Third, a Steadicam. ""These phones, because they’re so light, and they’re so small, a human hand — no matter how stable you are — it will shake. And it won’t look good,"" says Baker. ""So you needed the Steadicam rig to stabilize it."" The final ingredient was a set of anamorphic adapter lenses that attach to the iPhone. The lenses were prototypes from Moondog Labs, and Baker said they were essential to making Tangerine look like it belonged on a big screen. ""To tell you the truth, I wouldn’t have even made the movie without it,"" Baker says. ""It truly elevated it to a cinematic level.""   ""Jesus Christ, man, I was on The Wire."" Like any conventional film, Tangerine underwent post-production. ""With a lot of these social realist films, the first thing you do is drain the color,"" Baker says. ""We went the other way. We pumped the colors and put the saturation through the roof. Just because the world there is so colorful, and the women are so colorful. We wanted it to match them."" (Orange emerged as the dominant color in the film, inspiring its title.) The final step was to apply a digital grain to the movie, giving it a quality more reminiscent of actual film. At first, the cast wasn’t convinced shooting with the iPhone would work. ""I had some hesitancy about it, more out of pride,"" says James Ransone, who plays Chester, the pimp at the center of Tangerine’s love triangle. ""I’m like, Jesus Christ, man, I was on The Wire. I’ve ended up in iPhone movies!"" But Ransone came to appreciate the flexibility of the device. ""There’s a lot that can be done with an iPhone."" (One example: Baker shot several scenes while riding his 10-speed bicycle in circles around his actors.) Ransone said that the key to shooting Tangerine was having a team well-versed in traditional filmmaking. ""You still need to know how editing works. You still need to know how sound works. You still need to know how a camera works,"" he says. ""You can’t just go out and shoot."" iPhone footage hasn’t yet caught up with true 35 millimeter film — a high bar — but Ransone expects it will some day. ""Yes, you can make a beautiful-looking film on a shoestring budget,"" he says. ""But you have to know 100 years worth of filmmaking."" ""You can make a beautiful film on a shoestring budget."" The unusual creative process behind Tangerine doesn’t stop with its camera. Baker made the movie after becoming obsessed with a donut store in his neighborhood, a seedy block on Santa Monica Boulevard with a notorious reputation. ""It was a chaotic corner — there was always something going on in Donut Time,"" he says. ""So I said, I wanna make a film about Donut Time."" That idea led him and his co-writer, Chris Bergoch, to a nearby LGBT center, where they met Mya Taylor, an aspiring singer and actress, who in turn introduced the filmmakers to her roommate and eventual co-star, Kiki Kitana Rodriguez. The two women began sharing some stories from around the block, (""People love to hear drama. Especially filmmakers,"" Taylor tells me) and happened upon a striking bit of drama from the neighborhood: a trans woman became enraged when she heard her boyfriend had slept with a biological female — ""actual fish,"" as they say in Tangerine. The trans woman decided to hunt the other woman down, and thus Tangerine found its inspiration, with the writers collaborating with their cast on the script.   The result, at least for me, is the ideal Sundance movie: totally unexpected, set in a world I’ve never visited, with a story the major studios wouldn’t touch with a 10-foot selfie stick. Rodriguez is an effervescent blur as Sin-Dee Rella, an ex-con hunting down her pimp fiancée’s mistress on Christmas Eve. She stomps down Hollywood’s Walk of Fame like it’s a catwalk, spitting fire at anyone dumb enough to cross her, and manages to terrify nearly every man she meets. Taylor, as her best friend and fellow prostitute Alexandra, tries to talk sense into Sin-Dee every step of the way, cleaning up the damage in her wake. Their sisterhood in the face of real danger brings depth to the frequently over-the-top comedy. Tangerine isn’t perfect — it slows considerably in its final third, and the big climax at Donut Time feels less convincing than the film that led up to it. But in a festival full of coming-of-age dramas and straightforward documentaries, it’s a minor miracle: a good long look at the margins, captured by a $550 phone.",0.45491692406257894,0.545083075937421,0.17268581040555897,1008,4.8025793650793647,550,6.0636363636363635,0,4,"Apple, Culture, Entertainment, Tech, Report",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

AT&T is ostensibly trying to reach the droves of teens that have fallen in love with Snapchat, and doing so means experimenting with what's possible on the new platform. Scripted video series aren't brand new to Snapchat, but they're far from a common use. AT&T's hope is that the short-lived nature of Snapchat videos will make people feel compelled to watch them, rather than planning to stream them at a later date and then never doing so.  Fans will determine what happens on the show AT&T is really going all out to reach the teens. It's grabbing YouTube and Vine stars — including names from Video Game High School and Epic Meal Time — to act in the show, and those stars will also ask their audiences what they want to see from the series. AT&T says that fan input will be used to determine ""superhero identities, enemies, costumes, origin stories, and plot lines."" Its hope is that by the time those fans have given their input and the show is produced, there'll be enough of a built-in audience to kick things off. They'll all have to head to the Snapchat account @SnapperHero to watch it (meaning that this won't live inside of Snapchat's new Discover area). This is certainly a strange experiment for AT&T, but it's tried similar ways of reaching out to teens before. Over the past two years, it's also worked on a YouTube series called @SummerBreak, which is about a group of high-schoolers' relationships over the course of a summer. The show has received over 60 million views. Naturally, it's also a big ad for AT&T that shows how AT&T phones help the kids keep in touch. Presumably, AT&T will do something similar for SnapperHero.

It’s Sunday night on the weekend before Thanksgiving, and Odell Beckham Jr. has just given his New York Giants a big lead on their arch-rival Dallas Cowboys in the beginning of the second quarter. He lies on the turf, briefly savoring the 43-yard touchdown pass he’s just caught. It was an unbelievable, once-in-a-career catch. He’d leapt backwards, stretching the length of his body and snaring the football with two fingers and his thumb. Despite an illegal hit by Cowboys defensive back Brandon Carr, he’d held on: 14-3, Giants. Beckham’s team will ultimately lose, but it’s the catch that everyone will remember. Beckham gets up, tosses the ball into the air, and struts through the end zone with his arms outstretched as the 80,520 fans in attendance roar in appreciation. In an otherwise unremarkable game, Beckham has made an utterly remarkable play — a play that will be seen around the world. Photos of the catch flood Twitter instantly. Most depict paused TVs showing the replay, the TiVo interface visible everywhere. A minute or two later, a Vine appears in everyone’s timeline: six seconds of the catch, recorded by a user named Chipper with a dog for an account photo. To date, the Vine has been viewed nearly 7 million times. While Beckham is still celebrating, the @ESPNNFL account tweets ""HOLY COW ODELL BECKHAM!!!!!!!!!!!!!"" (That’s 14 exclamation points.) But it takes a full 15 minutes before ESPN shares a picture on its SportsCenter Twitter account, with the caption ""Catch. Of. The. Year. #sctop10."" The account’s 13.5 million followers go rabid: the tweet is shared and fav’d upwards of 50,000 times. Such is ESPN’s power that it can show up late to the party and still dominate the scene. Under president John Skipper and the Disney umbrella, ESPN has spent the last decade amassing an untouchably large amount of live sports programming. The network’s empire extends from football and basketball; to auto sports and the X-Games; to ultimate frisbee, poker, and bowling. It broadcasts the World Cup and the Masters, Monday Night Football and the NBA Playoffs. By any measure – it’s the most popular cable channel by a mile; it commands a per-subscriber fee from cable companies equal to the next five most expensive combined; it’s valued at more than $50 billion, 13 times as much as Disney-owned ABC — ESPN is the country’s most powerful media company. The calculus is as simple as it is devastatingly effective: sports is practically the only TV that millions of people still insist on watching live, and ESPN owns almost all the sports. But it may not stay that way for long. When ESPN launched in 1979, the company competed for attention with TV, radio, and newspapers. But in 2015 sports fans have online fantasy teams and prop bets; they’re on Twitter, Vine, Snapchat, and Facebook; they’re watching games on their phones, their tablets, and their laptops. They want to read about sports, talk about sports, and watch sports while they watch other sports. If ESPN doesn’t provide those services, someone else will. ESPN’s long-stated mission is to meet sports fans wherever they are. And so the company is embarking on a sweeping mission to expand its dominion beyond cable TV to whatever comes next — even if it’s not sure what that will be. In short: ESPN’s not okay with Chipper winning the Vine battle anymore. SportsCenter is the most important property at ESPN. It's live 18 hours each day, beginning with the 9AM show. It was the first show to air when ESPN switched on its satellites on September 7th, 1979 – the second was a slow-pitch softball game — and has been the network’s flagship brand ever since. During that first broadcast, Lee Leonard, sitting in front of an impressionistic montage of sports figures, told viewers ESPN would be where viewers could come find ""where all the sports action is, as of right now."" As the camera zoomed in on Leonard’s enormous glasses and beige suit (which matched the wall a little too well), he introduced SportsCenter: ""Now here’s another innovation on ESPN, and it’s going to be a big part of our future: the SportsCenter with George Grande. He’ll have the latest on what’s happening all around."" And indeed, for over three decades and more than 50,000 episodes, SportsCenter was the place you went for dispatches from every corner of the sports world. There was no Twitter, no Vine, no YouTube; for sports fans, there was only SportsCenter. In 2015, SportsCenter is different. It’s glossier, more personal — a Good Morning America for sports fans. It’s still a water cooler of sorts, designed to fill you in on things you missed and tell you everything you need to know about them. But now its vaunted ""Top 10"" segment shows more niche sports, more viral videos; its anchors spend more time on news and analysis and far less on showing the games themselves. Like every other show on the network, it’s been forced to adapt to a new audience: the relentless consumer, the one who’s already seen the plays of the day and tunes into SportsCenter to see what they missed and, just as importantly, how they’re supposed to feel about it. The morning after Beckham’s catch, I’m standing just off-camera in the SportsCenter studio, in sleepy Bristol, Connecticut. You can hardly make a left turn in Bristol, a town of 60,000, without ending up on ESPN’s sprawling campus. Outside, it’s a dark and dreary Monday. But SportsCenter’s updated set, which debuted in June and looks a bit like the bridge of Star Trek’s Enterprise — only bigger and with more buttons — is buzzing. While an army of producers and camera operators gathers around a desk in the center of the room, co-anchor Kevin Negandhi paces the catwalk (yes, there’s a catwalk, about 18 inches off the ground), perfecting his blocking with a cameraman. Behind him, an enormous screen displays a photo of Odell Beckham Jr., his outstretched right hand completing last night’s catch. Negandhi, who’s anchored the show since 2011, checks his tie clip in the camera’s reflection and asks if he’s in the right spot. To his right are dozens of screens; to his left, more screens, 114 in all. Over the next hour, the screens will work individually and in tandem as they’re moved constantly around the set, broadcasting tweets and videos as Negandhi and co-anchor Hannah Storm show athletes responding to Beckham’s catch, talk about its place in NFL history, and later dissect breaking baseball news. After SportsCenter wrapped for the morning, I sat down with Negandhi and Storm on comfortable orange chairs inside the stunning new Digital Center 2, where the show is taped. DC-2, as it’s widely known, is the 18th building on ESPN’s campus. It’s an immaculate, slightly sterile new production facility that was under construction for more than three years before opening its doors last summer. It is 194,000 square feet of technological progress, from the studios and the suite of editing rooms to the energy-efficient server rooms and the ""social media lounge"" upstairs. Every corner of DC-2 is a reminder of the intersection of sports and technology: the lobby is outfitted with large vertical screens, one showing every single ""This is SportsCenter"" ad ever made. Walk further and you’ll see a gigantic ticker on the wall scrolling  news and scores. As you walk up the stairs to the studio, there’s a wired CableCam floating above you, ominously watching. The new SportsCenter set is the crown jewel of the building: 9,700 square feet of space that will be used to broadcast the show on ESPN’s mass of channels. The revamped set was designed to make SportsCenter more personal, to show anchors moving around and interacting, but also to help the show move at the speed of the internet. ESPN has long been criticized for allowing news to break overnight while it ran repeats of the previous day’s shows; now the premier show in sports can update and broadcast in real time. TV still matters at ESPN, and in every way DC-2 is wired for the future of TV. It’s capable of broadcasting in 4K and 8K, and if by some miracle 3D actually takes off, ESPN will be ready for that, too. TV is still where the network makes most of its money, and it will be for the foreseeable future. But when – not if, but when — that changes, ESPN says it will be ready. It has moved staff, built buildings, and overhauled how the company operates to make sure of that. The strategy to keep ESPN on top breaks down along two broad lines. The first is an adjustment in how ESPN sees itself: the company has reorganized to promote more sharing across platforms, even launching the buzzword-friendly Content Sharing Initiative. ESPN the TV network, ESPN the radio provider, ESPN the magazine, ESPN the Instagram account, and ESPN the app maker are all becoming one. That’s Rob King’s project. King is the senior vice president of news and SportsCenter, which means he oversees everything from the flagship show to its apps and Twitter handles. In his previous role, he oversaw a merging of ESPN’s digital and print operations into a single publication. He’s also combined the company’s many disparate breaking news and highlights teams into cross-company groups, which funnel information and assets to every ESPN outpost on any platform. ""Whatever platform [fans] are using,"" he says, ""whatever time of day it is, however they’re connecting with their friends, we need to be there because that’s holding up our end of the relationship."" Holding up its end has meant a complete overhaul and upgrade of ESPN’s technology to make it faster, more efficient, and more capable than before. ESPN has a track record of success when it comes to capitalizing on new technology: ESPNet SportsZone, a primitive website, built a huge early-internet audience in 1995; in 2011, WatchESPN let you watch live cable TV on a mobile device for the first time in history. The company has even won accolades for seemingly simple TV innovations, like putting a yellow line on the screen to indicate the first-down line or a square around the plate for the strike zone. In sports TV, most of what’s now ubiquitous began with ESPN. This time, the biggest change is one viewers don’t see: the 1,110 miles of fiber-optic cable wired throughout DC-2. Fiber replaces the copper wire used elsewhere throughout ESPN and has fundamentally changed the speed at which the network can operate. A single fiber cable can carry 15-20 times as many signals more than 200 times farther than copper; that upgrade makes it possible for ESPN to have more footage at its disposal at all times. Years ago, Joe Sack remembers, it was all done on videotape. ""You can only do one thing at one time with one tape. Right? So if you want to do two things live, you’ve got to record it twice. If you want to do three things, you’ve got to record it three times."" That led to confusion and clutter and slowed every process down. Copper cabling sped up the process, but even that only moved one signal at a time. During that era, ESPN had to build huge, impossibly complicated facilities that couldn’t grow or adapt to new uses. Today ESPN is struggling to keep up with the speed of mobile and social audiences. And speed is everything. ""If you are slow,"" says Anthony Mormile, ESPN’s VP of digital video, ""and want to make it beautiful, you can’t live in the Twitter space. Because some guy just held his phone up to his TV and put it up on Twitter, or some guy just GIF’d it, or some guy made a Vine and got the whole play up, and here we come eight minutes after it happened with a ‘ta-da! look at this beautiful opening. And we’ve got music and natural sound!’ And you’re like ‘we already saw it, dude.’"" ESPN’s brand has long gone beyond TV, but the shift is accelerating. ""There are still a number of people on this campus who are shocked when you give them an all-in report,"" he says. ""They say ‘whoa, more people watched my video on Twitter than ever saw it on SportsCenter?’ And you’re like, that’s the power of social."" To do its job properly now, ESPN needs to optimize sports for every platform at once – and the list keeps growing. ""We [even] have gas station TV now,"" says Mormile, ""so when you’re filling up at the pump you have ESPN content. And the platforms keep changing, whether it’s Apple TV or Roku or you’re trying to make it prepared for Snapchat or Instagram."" That development is on display at Building 13 of the Bristol campus, known to employees as Transmission. As many as 110 streams can be captured at once here, either via the satellites or through the fiber network, and all are stored on a set of servers. Even as footage is recording, it’s available to be immediately cut and clipped. That means ESPN is now able to take a single stream of a game, and in real time make it available absolutely everywhere — for ESPN’s producers and for fans around the world. When something huge happens — Odell Beckham makes an earth-shattering catch, Usain Bolt breaks another world record, a minor league hockey fight breaks out while the players are all wearing Batman costumes — the SportsCenter team can cut highlights while the mobile team grabs the play that matters and sends it to your phone with a push alert. Meanwhile, the ESPN.com crew can put together a clip of the five best catches of all time, while the social media team is making GIFs. This is ESPN at its best and most internet-native: everything in its right place, and everything in real time. Much of ESPN’s historical success is rooted in the fact that covering sports is predictable business. ""In most organizations,"" says Rob King, ""you can’t plan for big events other than elections and hurricane season. But in our world, you can say, this will be a big game."" That means much of ESPN’s planning is done weeks and months in advance. On this Monday morning, the digital team is already sussing out angles for this weekend’s Packers-Patriots game, and they’re thinking about ranking all 636 players who will make the playoffs two months from now. But in the age of Twitter, viewers are hungry for off-the-cuff, unexpected viral moments that no one plans for. ""The best part,"" King says, ""and the most fun, is when Odell Beckham does something you’ve never seen before. And that’s when it’s like alright, where is everybody? And what is this like? And how does this show up in the social space? And how can we compare it to other catches? And, you know, we’ve got the ESPYs coming up in July, how do we make sure that that’s going to be a play of the year nominee?"" This is the tension, King says: the best time to be a sports fan is when the crazy things happen. But that’s when it’s also hardest to be a sports network. ""Welcome to my nightmare,"" says Mormile when I bring up Beckham’s catch. Moments after Beckham landed on his back, Mormile’s team sprung to action. ""So now everybody goes ‘I didn’t see the catch! I heard there was a sick catch last night.’ So I turn around and I say, how do I get that catch to mobile fans?""   Catch. Of. The. Year. #SCtop10 pic.twitter.com/eCVfT9ZuYQ   It’s a race, one ESPN is investing heavily in winning. ""The fans,"" Mormile tells me, ""just want to see the play. They don’t care that you ripped it off the TV with your cellphone. So for us, we made a concerted effort to be even faster, and because ESPN technology is just amazing at what they do, we now have essentially real-time plays. And the real-time plays have all but eliminated the piracy. So we get a play up, maybe it’s on a social platform 15 to 30 seconds after it happens, and there’s no need for anybody to [copy]."" There was only one problem in the Beckham example, Mormile tells me with a smirk: ""No video on mobile."" ESPN doesn’t own the rights to NFL highlights on mobile platforms (for now), so they have to develop workarounds. ""We get real creative with a still shot, and analysis of ‘is it the greatest catch of all time?’"" Even without video, the tweet went viral. On Mormile’s desk sits a Sanyo MVP, the black, ESPN-branded flip phone released in 2006. It represented the beginning of a company-wide effort to bring sports content to cellphones. This was two years before the iPhone and Android, and there was no useful way to get sports news and scores to the growing mobile market. So ESPN announced it was becoming a cellphone provider and would be making devices for sports fans. The MVP shipped with a simple Java app that delivered real-time scores (often ahead of the TV broadcast) and text message alerts whenever your team scored. Mobile ESPN, as it was originally called, failed. Spectacularly. The phone was big, slow, and expensive, and it was useless for anything but getting sports news. Steve Jobs famously called Mobile ESPN ""the dumbest fucking idea I have ever heard."" Seven months after launch, ESPN shuttered the project at a loss of $150 million. But the MVP is surely part of why ESPN’s mobile offering was more popular than its desktop website as long ago as 2006. It’s also why ESPN is a launch partner for Snapchat Discovery, the company’s first tentative foray into professional content. The whole ethos here is to throw things at the wall and see what sticks. For all its faults, Mobile ESPN helped the company see what works (and what doesn’t) on phones. It may have been clunky, but it gave the company a huge head start on mobile that’s still paying dividends now. Long-term, ESPN’s future will have to exist somewhere in the massively distributed content landscape. But for now, it’s still mostly a TV network. And inside DC-2, a floor below the SportsCenter studio, there’s another show to plan for. The Monday Night Countdown stars sit around a table with the show’s producers, debating the merit of Beckham’s catch. Keyshawn Johnson and Cris Carter, two Hall of Fame-caliber wide receivers turned Monday Night Countdown analysts, practice for the show: Carter talks about ""clearing your shoulders"" to make a catch, twisting his body to demonstrate. New gloves, he says, make difficult catches easier than they once were. Johnson says he made a catch similar to Beckham’s when played for the Jets, but decides not to mention it on-air when he laughingly remembers the pass wasn’t actually intended for him at all. They work on transitions and monologues, making sure their analysis is interesting and distinct. Then each makes his pick for the evening’s two games and talks about who’s going to win the AFC West. (Four analysts, four strongly worded and radically different opinions.) The group breaks, off to prepare and change before the show starts at 6PM. Keyshawn Johnson bounds up the stairs to the studio two at a time, and Cris Carter ties his scarf back on, whistling ""Oh Christmas Tree"" to himself. Mike Ditka, who is referred to exclusively as ""Coach,"" ambles off without a word. Tom Jackson stays to chat with producers about the rundown. By the time the games start on Monday evening, almost everyone on the ESPN campus will have gone home. Covering the game is the easy part, they all tell me. It’s what ESPN has done for decades, and does better than anyone. ESPN’s concern is making great television. And, increasingly, with making great Snapchat, and great Instagram, and great Twitter, and great Xbox. It all comes back to the company motto, which I first saw in giant letters hanging outside the building, facing the parking lot: ""To serve sports fans wherever sports are watched, listened to, discussed, debated, read about or played.""All over ESPN, people recite the motto to me and to each other, and they consider the question it poses: how do you do that in 2015, when the number of channels starts to lurch toward infinity? ESPN has a lot of answers, and a lot of technology to throw at those answers, but the questions come up more and more frequently. It’s been a long Monday, and a chaotic one, but it feels like everyone at ESPN is hoping something crazy happens tonight: that someone makes another internet-shaking catch, or breaks a record, or says something so outrageous that sports fans across the planet snap to attention and look to ESPN for coverage. And as I stand in Transmission, where hundreds of screens capture hundreds of games and prepare them for immediate broadcast to every platform you use and a half-dozen you don’t, I get the sense ESPN loves the opportunity to prove what it can do. Anthony Mormile certainly does. As we talk in the afternoon, he runs through the day: two high-profile baseball players traded to the same team, two important football games, and that Odell Beckham catch. He riles himself up just talking about it. ""This is an amazing sports day."" Then he pauses. ""Actually, Mondays are already pretty fun days for us.""

Back in 2012, feminist critic Anita Sarkeesian posted a massive wall of furious, dismissive, or actively threatening YouTube comments that people had left on her proposal for a video series about female characters in games. At the time, this harassment wasn't exactly unprecedented, but it seemed bizarre and singular — how could a fairly mild video about narrative tropes draw such pure hatred? Three years later, it's become practically routine, and Sarkeesian has posted a week's worth of equally angry and depressingly similar Twitter messages. Obviously, this is a biased statement. A more objective reporter would concede that the entire campaign against Anita Sarkeesian could be an elaborate charade, a brilliant gambit involving hundreds of paid-off vloggers, thousands of fake Twitter accounts, and collaboration at the very top levels of the FBI and various state police forces. She could even be faking the wave of people who descend on our writers every time they mention Anita Sarkeesian! But maybe, hidden behind the exhortations to ""kill yourself,"" the explicit rape threats, and the occasional smug assertion that the whole thing is a false flag campaign, there are actual human beings. As it turns out, some of the most direct threats come from throwaway accounts, or ones that have been suspended. But some of them are extant, long-running feeds from people who... well, it's hard to say that they have regular lives, or passions, because their timelines are mostly just racist or homophobic jokes and insults. But if you trawl deep enough, little pieces of normality peek out. And it makes everything all the more frustrating. (Warning: unsurprisingly graphic language ahead.) Here's a pretty mild one:   DiceTrojan has a very important mission: preserving the noble institution of internet death threats. But he also enjoyed a winter vacation, just like the rest of us.   Adensma shows up here a lot, whether he's praising games with ""girl characters half naked"" or expressing extremely graphic sexual assault fantasies.   But he's experienced his own share of oppression at the hands of girl gamers.   Now we're back to the intentionally non-actionable death wishes, courtesy of Johnatan Irons:   ""I personally dont [sic] have any thing against her (im just a troll),"" he explains. We imagine his girlfriend understands, unless she's also just a figment of his trolling.   It's hard to find anything but hatred in these timelines, some of which span years and thousands of tweets.   But sometimes you find out they had the same reaction to Gravity as you did. For once, they unabashedly, unmaliciously liked something.   Maybe we've walked by some of these people on the street? Maybe we sat a few tables over at a restaurant, while they were typing something like this?   How much of it is just an act? How much does it actually matter? How much empathy should we feel when we read something that genuinely seems like a cry for help, when the entire premise of modern-day trolling is that the internet is just a giant game of make-believe, and you're a fool to do more than point and laugh?   None of this is encouraging, especially when you know that just mentioning it puts you in the crosshairs, too. It doesn't prove that there's some hidden decency to reach or some way to impose offline consequences (I haven't looked up anything about these people's real identities, and I don't plan to.) It doesn't prove anything about what kind of person does this, because someone's web presence doesn't necessarily indicate much about their everyday lives. All it proves is that this isn't some barrage of throwaway insults in a vacuum.

At least a couple developers are reporting in the Pebble forums that Apple is rejecting app updates for mentioning a competing platform — Pebble. A developer for the SeaNav US iOS app says Apple rejected an update for the app, which supported Pebble for two years, and said so in the app description and metadata. Apple cited this reason from its App Store review guidelines document: 3.1 - Apps or metadata that mentions the name of any other mobile platform will be rejected 3.1 Details We noticed that your app or its metadata contains irrelevant platform information in the app. Providing future platform compatibility plans, or other platform references, is not appropriate for the App Store. Specifically, your app and app description declare support for the Pebble Smartwatch. Next Steps Please remove any instances of this information from your app and its marketing materials, including the Application Description, What's New info, Previews and screenshots. Since your iTunes Connect Application State is Rejected, a new binary will be required. Make the desired metadata changes when you upload the new binary. NOTE: Please be sure to make any metadata changes to all App Localizations by selecting each specific localization and making appropriate changes. Apple says it's not rejecting apps that work with other platforms According to the developer, there were no changes to the app's support for Pebble in the new version. Another developer chimed in: ""I confirm that Apple rejects updates referring to Pebble in the metadata. We had an image of a Pebble in our screenshots and had to remove this."" But others have noted that their apps mention Pebble and have made it through Apple's submissions process just fine. Following news of the rejections, Apple told Business Insider that it's not rejecting apps or app updates that work with Pebble's devices. Pebble also chimed in on Reddit, saying it was working with Apple, which was being ""super responsive"" to concerns that existing apps might get the kibosh: Update: Still a work-in-progress, but we're working with Apple to clear up any misunderstandings to make sure rejections like the handful of recent ones don't happen again—they're being super responsive the concerns that bubbled up (much appreciated!). Apps are still getting approved with mentions of Pebble support in the description or metadata (e.g. RunKeeper). For now, developers should continue with their iOS app update plans and approval submissions to the iTunes store as normal (i.e. include Pebble support in your app info if that was your original intent). Thus far, Apple's policy has been to bar developers from mentioning ""any other mobile platform"" in their apps, and there's no evidence of this being part of a larger trend. Update April 24th, 7:24PM: This post has been updated to include Apple's response, as well as Pebble's.

At the Conde Nast International Luxury Conference earlier this week, Ive and Newson shared some of their thoughts on designing the Apple Watch and declared it shouldn't be compared to mechanical watches given the vast differences between the two products. And now we have video of the interview, conducted by Vogue's International Fashion Editor Suzy Menkes. ""Marc and I have collected mechanical watches for many years.""  ""When we started work on the iPhone, the motivation there was we all pretty much couldn’t stand our phones, and we wanted a better phone,"" Ive said. ""When we worked on the Watch, the motivation was completely different. We happen to love our watches. Both Marc and I have collected mechanical watches for many years."" Ive said that Apple didn't create the Watch because it believes it could do a better job than current watchmakers and instead pointed to the wrist as the next great spot for technology. ""Very differently, it was because we saw that the wrist was a fabulous place for technology,"" Ive said. Marc Newson agreed. ""The wrist is, and has always been for literally hundreds of years, one of the best places on the body to put an object."" When asked how the Apple Watch will handle the test of time, Ive pointed out that even mechanical watches need servicing, and the Apple Watch will likely be no different. ""I hope the Watch will remain beautiful. The [mechanical] watches that we have required servicing. They don’t all work,"" Ive noted. ""The product that I buy next week, it will be more capable and will do things that I cannot possibly imagine in just six months’ time. Now I think that’s extraordinary. I don’t know how we can compare these wonderful mechanical watches that we own and a product [Apple Watch] that has such a comprehensive functionality and capability that will grow and change beyond our imagining,"" Ive said. ""We saw that the wrist was a fabulous place for technology."" Hyperbole aside, the Apple Watch is bound to comparisons to mechanical watches for the foreseeable future. This is the first watch of many, not the watch that will last forever. While future Apple Watches may exceed our imagination down the line, a watch that cannot keep a full day's time under normal use is far from deserving of the language Ive used to describe it.  ""The choice for gold wasn’t driven by some notion of a pre-determined price point."" Ive said there will be a number of different reasons people use the Apple Watch, from fitness, to staying connected, to the new ways to communicate with other Apple Watch users. But Ive believes the Watch will give people more confidence in their ability to reach out at any time to one another, even more than the cell phone has. ""This is one of the first times that we can make some assumptions that somebody else has this product intimately connected with them for most of the day. You can’t make that assumption with the phone."" When Menkes questioned the design duo about Apple's growing reach in the luxury market, Ive noted that it didn't go with gold on the Watch to hit a price point, but because they loved the material. ""The choice for gold wasn’t driven by some notion of a pre-determined price point. That absolutely wasn’t the reason we chose that material. We chose that material because we loved it,"" Ive said. Apple's design chief said the company isn't intentionally competing with luxury goods and has been on the same path since its inception, to make technology more approachable. ""What I know is that was not our intent at all. Our intent has remained the same and is consistent, which has been to try and take what is remarkable technology, in terms of its capability and its utility, and make it more and more personal. That’s what we’re trying to do.""

You have successfully purchased an Apple Watch, or you’re interested in how the setup process works. Either way, you are to be congratulated for your initiative and willingness to take a risk on a brand new platform, one that lives on your wrist and makes your wrist part of how you live. Also, it has a really great Mickey Mouse watch face. We’re here to help. This article explains the major steps you will need to go through to set up and understand your new Apple Watch. It is virtually identical for all versions of the watch, from the least-expensive Sport on up to the Edition. Be warned that this workflow isn’t 100 percent comprehensive — these are the main things you’ll need to know to have a deep and fulfilling relationship with the new technology resting just above your hand.   Your Watch will come out of the box with some battery life, but it’s generally considered best practice to fully charge any piece of electronics when you first use it. Set your watch on the charger, and leave it there while you set it up for the first time. Also, grab a beverage, because this process really does take upwards of an hour or two to do it right — at least as much time as setting up a new phone takes. Sport owners are encouraged to drink a cuppa joe, regular Watch users may consider a latte, while Edition owners probably should let a glass of ‘96 Cheval Blanc breathe for a bit. If the Watch doesn’t power on as you set it on the charger, press the side button (not the digital crown) to turn it on.   The Watch will show you a screen asking you to choose a language. Pick one that you understand, and then wait a moment for the Watch to configure itself with those letters and words. Next, you’ll see a screen asking you to open the Apple Watch app on your iPhone, which Apple has helpfully pre-installed with the last iPhone update. So do that, and then hit the prompt on the Apple Watch. The Watch will now show a pretty blue bubble of undulating dots, while the iPhone will open up the camera and direct you to center the viewfinder on the Watch. This is a process familiar to many: it’s essentially the same thing as scanning a QR code. Only this is the prettiest QR code in the history of technology. If the camera-based pairing isn’t working for any reason, you can tap the ""i"" button on the watch to bring up a six-digit code, which you can enter on your iPhone to pair the two devices together.   Next, you’ll need to choose your wrist preference, right or left. The Apple Watch works on either. After that, you’ll need to accept the Terms of Service, which you are obviously not going to read in full. Take a drink from your beverage of choice instead. You’ll also need to register your Apple Watch with Apple via your Apple ID during this process. Next, you will see a series of setup notices for Location Services, Siri, and Diagnostics. The Watch pulls the settings for each of these from your iPhone. So if you have Location turned on for your iPhone, it will be available to the Watch. Ditto for the rest.   Now, Apple will ask you to set up a numeric passcode on your watch. Do that, and when it asks you if you’d like to unlock your watch with your phone, say yes. What all this means is that so long as your Watch is on your wrist, it will stay unlocked. If you take it off, you’ll need to enter the passcode to use it. When it’s on your wrist, unlocking your phone just once will also unlock the watch. The last option you’ll see offers to pre-install apps on your Watch as a comprehensive batch, instead of making you do it one by one. This is up to you, but having a bunch of apps on the Watch doesn’t seem to harm anything, so you may as well let it install them all. Right now, Watch apps are just little extensions of the apps that are already installed on your phone, so there’s a very good chance you have a bunch of them already! You will manage what is and isn’t installed on your watch in a later step via the iPhone’s Watch app.   This next step takes a good while. The Watch needs to get a lot of information and apps. You’ll see a radial progress indicator around an Apple logo. Edition users: by now your wine has breathed long enough and you should feel free to partake. Don’t overdo it, though; that’s a mighty fine wine you’ve got there, and you should respect the time and effort that went into it. Note that after the progress indicator has finished, the Watch may still be syncing some data or apps over from your iPhone. It may be a little slower than you expect during the first minutes of use because of that.   Congratulations! If you really wanted to, you could stop now and just see how you feel about the Apple Watch and its multivarious zones and interaction models. Our full review has the details on what happens in the watch face, apps, glances, and notifications. But if you want to have your Watch feel better, the truth is you’re really only a little less than halfway done. But you deserve a break, and we recommend you kick back and mess around with some watch faces. Here’s how:   Like your iPhone, your Apple Watch has a huge array of settings to go through. You can adjust some of them on the Watch itself in its settings app, but it’s faster and easier to just do most of this on your iPhone — the settings sync over quickly. The settings are split into a few sections, with general stuff at the top and app-by-app settings underneath. There are a ton of settings! Just spend some time navigating around to see if there’s anything you’d like to change, but for most of these you can probably live with the defaults. We would recommend at least looking at Sounds & Haptics. That’s where you set how loudly your Watch beeps when you get a notification (suggestion: don’t let it beep at all). You can also set the strength of the haptics, which is how hard the watch taps you when you get an alert. Most of us have found that the max setting is best. And if you still can’t feel it, you can turn on ""Prominent Haptics,"" which does exactly what it says: it makes your watch really vibrate a lot just before the regular tap when you get a notification.   You can use Apple Pay on your Watch by double-clicking the main button, but it’s not set up with your card out of the box. To set it up, head on down to the app settings for Passbook & Apple Pay on your phone’s Apple Watch app. Here, you’ll find one of the many places where you have the option to ""Mirror my iPhone,"" which means the cards you see on the phone also show up on your Watch. That doesn’t apply to credit cards, though. You’ll need to tap ""Add Credit or Debit Card"" to get one activated and approved for use from your Watch. When you want to pay, just double-click that button. The Watch will only let you pay after it’s been attached to your wrist and you’ve unlocked your iPhone with TouchID, so random people shouldn’t be able to pay for stuff with your Watch. (The Watch doesn’t know whose wrist it’s on, though: if someone else puts it on and you unlock your phone, they’ll be able to pay with your card. But why is someone else wearing your Watch?)   Apple has a few systems built into the Apple Watch for tracking your health. There’s a Workout app and a heart rate monitor for exercise, but the one that you’ll probably like the most is the Activity app. It tracks your steps and general activity level with three daily meters: movement, exercise, and time spent standing. It can also pester you to stand up from time to time, which is helpful! But it doesn’t do all that until you’ve set up the Activity app. Some people may have good reason not to turn it on, but for most it’s a nice little way to make sure you’re not being too lazy. So to set it up, open the app up (Hooray, your first Watch app!) on the Watch. To do it, click the Digital Crown until you’re looking at your app grid, an array of circular icons set out in a honeycomb pattern. Pan around until you see the Activity app; it looks like three concentric circles. Once you do, you’ll also have the Activity app show up on your iPhone. Tap through all the details on the watch screen. If you want, some watch faces can let you add your activity meter as a complication. Lastly, if you want you can enter in your body info into the Health section of the preferences app, if that’s something you want to track. There are a few more steps left, and they’re all going to require you to make some tough decisions, so you will want to build up a reserve of gumption. Plus, you’ve done a lot already! You’ve earned it!   Better? Good, now it’s time to go back to the Apple Watch app on your iPhone and drill into notifications. By default, everything that notifies you on your iPhone will also notify you on your Watch. But if you’re anything like me (or most people), you probably haven’t done much clean-up of what gets to notify you on your phone. That ""Your Turn"" notification from Words with Friends might not be that bothersome on your phone, but on your Watch is can be super annoying. So go through that section of the Watch app and turn off anything you don’t want to see on your wrist. It’ll still be on your phone. Apple Apps that have Watch-specific settings are at the top, mirroring options underneath. You can also choose whether you’d like a red dot as a missed notifications indicator. Read more: How to save your iPhone and Apple Watch from notification hell   The Apple Watch can work without your iPhone right there for a few things, including playing music for your workout. But to do it, you’ll have to head into iTunes or the Music app on your phone to sync some music over to the Watch (sorry, Spotify users). Set up a playlist, then find the settings for Music in the Watch app on your iPhone, and that’s where you pick your playlist. You’re doing this now because it takes a little while for the music to sync, and it needs to be sitting on the charger for it to happen. Obviously, the Watch doesn’t have a headphone jack, so you’ll need a set of Bluetooth headphones to listen to music without your iPhone present. If you’ve got ‘em, go into the Watch’s settings and pair your Bluetooth headphones there.   Glances, you might recall, are the small info screens you access by swiping up from the watch face. There are a lot of them, and having to swipe through stuff you absolutely don’t care about to access stuff that you do care about is annoying. The best way to do that is from the Glances setting in the app. It works basically the same way as the organization page for Notification Center. You can reorder glances or hit the minus button to take them off your watch. By the way, you can also toggle Glances inside each app’s main settings page. Scroll down on the main screen of the Watch app, where all the installed apps are listed. If you tap on each one, you’ll find another notification option here and also, with many of them, the option to toggle a ""Glance.""   Apps on the Apple Watch are organized in a honeycomb pattern. The Watch is the ""main"" app, and it will always be at the center. You can roll the Digital Crown to zoom in to sections of your grid, or pan around to tap the one you want. But chances are there are only a few apps you will want to use all the time, so you might as well place them near the center. To do it, go into the App Layout of the Watch app on your iPhone and drag them around with a long-press. You can also head back to the main screen and poke around the individual settings for the main Apple apps. One app that would be good to tweak: Mail. That’s where you decide which mail alerts will come to your wrist. Almost done!   The penultimate step! By now, your contacts should all be synced over to the phone. You can access your favorites by pressing the button on the side of the Watch, then use the digital crown to scroll through them. By default, the Watch puts the people you’ve already marked as favorites here. But if you’d like a different set of folks on your Watch, you can change that in the iPhone’s Watch app.   That’s it! There still might be some data syncing over to the Apple Watch, so don’t panic if it feels a little laggy at first. It does get better once the sync is complete, but as we mentioned in our review, it will always have some load times for apps and glances. There’s still more you could do, if you wanted. Apple has a whole section for Watch apps if you want to poke around in its store. You can find Apple’s favorites in the Featured tab of the Watch App on your iPhone — and here are our favorite Watch apps. If you know somebody with an Apple Watch, you can send them heartbeats and drawings. Say ""Hey Siri"" at it to do Siri things. Mess around with a few watch faces again. But really, you’ve been sitting for a while, and at some point the Apple Watch is going to tell you that it would be a good idea to stand up. You may as well; that Activity Meter isn’t going to fill itself. Congrats on your new watch!

Or any number of other games and random apps for that matter.  Maybe you’ve hit OK thinking, “Yeah, I’ll change that later,” or “I don’t know what it would actually send me, but I don’t want to feel left out.” Maybe it didn’t bother you as much when the phone was in your pocket or sitting on your desk / nightstand / couch — but what about when it’s on your wrist? When each notification is both unavoidable and potentially visible to the world around you?  With the Apple Watch now rolling out worldwide, let’s take a moment to really look back and evaluate just what we need our phones to actively tell us at all hours day and night. Seriously, you gain nothing by letting Temple Run ping you at any time. Not every iPhone notification has to be mirrored on the Apple Watch (more on that later), but cleaning up your phone’s notifications helps lay a good foundation. Everyone with an iPhone should do this — and if you don’t have an iPhone, that’s okay (albeit a bit perplexing why you’ve read this far, but hey, you do you). Hop into the Notifications menu (via the Settings app) to see all your notifications-laden apps separated into two groups. Bad news? You have to deactivate the undesirable pings by hopping one-by-one into their individual sub-menus. Good news? It’s just one switch once you get there. I can’t tell you what to do here, but I can strongly suggest to err on the side of turning off notifications — and for the ones you keep, take a moment to get granular with settings like sounds, lock screen placement, and badge app icons. Some apps let you fine tune even further from within the app itself. Gmail and Slack have settings that are pretty easy to find on your own, while Twitter and Facebook require a slightly deeper dive. Good? Good. Now let's turn to the Watch itself. While yes, you can change a few settings from the Apple Watch itself, your iPhone’s now-permanent Watch app has all those same settings and many, many more. So don’t even bother with your new wrist ornament — let’s use the bigger screen instead. First things first, from the My Watch screen, go to Sounds and Haptics and turn off all Watch sounds. All of them. You’re welcome. Now to the notifications pane, presumably the reason you started reading this in the first place. Note the important top line: Notification alerts appear on Apple Watch when you’re wearing it and it’s unlocked. And you won’t get alerts on the Apple Watch if you’re actively using your iPhone. To view missed notifications, swipe down on your watch face.   By default, the Apple Watch will quickly move from the large icon to more details. With Notification Privacy on, it stops at the large icon until you tap. Got that? Your Watch won’t buzz if your iPhone screen is on and in use — and if you want to view the notification later, you swipe down on the watch face, identical to how you’d open the notification pane on a smartphone. Now, finally, we’re up to the list of notifications themselves. The only third-party apps listed are the ones that also push notifications to your phone, so if you cleaned that up, this part’ll be much easier. By default, all your iPhone alerts are mirrored. Let me be clear: this is a list of all the apps that are allowed to buzz your wrist. While some apps (notably Dark Sky) do some novel things with their Watch notifications, most are just variants of your iPhone notifications. Kill mercilessly. The final step? Stop looking down at your gadgets so much. This is the somewhat counterintuitive conclusion that by now you’ve probably heard a thousand times over. The Apple Watch’s best feature is that it gets you to check your phone less — but that doesn’t mean you have to now replace all the time by checking your wrist. Especially not for Temple Run notifications.",0.4411537363869115,0.5588462636130884,0.16687840744402926,732,4.6530054644808745,388,5.5257731958762886,0,16,"Apple, Tech",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

But the app story is dramatically different on the Watch in a way that you won't quite understand until you start to use one. Where on the iPhone and iPad, apps are almost everything that you do, on the Apple Watch, apps really aren't something you want to play around with. In fact, you may often find yourself wondering why you'd use some of these apps at all.  A lot of apps still need work That's because apps on the Apple Watch are, inherently, just extensions of the iPhone apps that they connect to. For now, they're basically fancy-looking widgets, and it becomes quickly apparent that not every app needs a widget. Instagram on an Apple Watch is reminiscent of clicking through your old flip phone's photo gallery. Djay offers a surprisingly capable way to mix music from your wrist, but it's hard to imagine when you'd open it up to do that. A lot of apps are also really buggy at the moment. Strava is one of the top fitness apps, but its Apple Watch app seemed to lose workout details. Microsoft's OneNote translates really well to the Watch, but it locks up, loses notes, and takes a long time to sync. That's not a knock on either of those companies. These are certainly issues that will be solved in the very near future — after all, it's day one for apps on a platform that developers haven't been able to test — but it's also a constant reminder of the state of Watch apps right now. The best Watch apps enhance a smartwatch's primary purpose: getting you information in a quicker, more convenient manner than pulling out your phone. There are a lot of apps out there already — and, admittedly, we haven't tried every single one of them — but many of the biggest names on the iPhone have figured out compelling ways to present their information on the Watch. We've looked through dozens of apps, and these are the ones you'll want to check out on the Apple Watch right off the bat.   As far as it's possible for there to be a cult favorite weather app, that app is Dark Sky. And not surprisingly, Dark Sky works perfectly on the Apple Watch because it removes the worst part of using Dark Sky on the iPhone: having to actually open it. Now, when inclement weather is approach, Dark Sky will present you with a rich notification that shows you exactly how much rain or snowfall to expect. And that's all you really want from it. The app does do a lot more, though you won't necessarily use it. There's a Dark Sky page for Glances, and if you want further weather detail, you can open up the app to get a five-day forecast. It looks nice and is easily digestible on the Watch, but it can all be very slow to load. That's not necessarily a big issue, though: you're really just waiting on those notifications.   When The New York Times announced that it had created an Apple Watch app that displayed ""one sentence stories,"" it sounded like the publication had thought up a needlessly fancy way of describing an app that only displays headlines. But its app really does what it claims to do: it boils down news stories into single sentences, each of which takes up no more than a single screen on the Watch. The Times' Watch app holds about six stories at a time. If any one catches your interest, you can usually scroll down for a few additional bullet points of information or a photo. If you want to read the entire story, just Force Touch and save it for later. The app's goal is to give you a very quick way to catch up on the biggest recent news, and it accomplishes that in a really satisfying way. It's one of the more polished (and responsive) apps that we've seen.   Somehow, Apple still doesn't offer public transit directions in its Maps app. It's a pretty inexcusable exclusion, but fortunately there are some good third-party apps to fill in the gap. Transit is our immediate favorite on the Apple Watch. Open it up, and it'll give you a button to get directions to your home or office and another button to pull up locations that you've recently routed to on your phone. The rest of the screen scrolls through the nearest public transit stops, only displaying the transit options (subway, bus, train, etc.) that you're interested in. When you do get directions from Transit, the entire journey is displayed on one screen in a simple, condensed manner. If you want to know more — like the location of a subway stop — you just tap on that specific step to pull up a map. Putting the entire list of steps on one scrolling screen is really key to making Transit the strongest option here. Citymapper is a great alternative, but it makes you swipe from step to step throughout your entire journey. That makes sense if you're somewhere unfamiliar and need detailed directions, but for the most part, you're probably just heading someplace nearby and want to know what will be the quickest bus or train to catch.   It's always a little annoying or awkward having to pull out your phone in order to look up what song is playing, but with Shazam on the Apple Watch, you won't have to. Shazam can't actually listen to music through the Watch — which is unfortunate — it actually just activates your phone. But it works quickly, and Shazam is surprisingly effective even through the pocket of your jeans. It's a more casual way of looking up a song (and its lyrics), and given how popular Shazam is, there's no reason to doubt that it won't have similar success here.   If you want to know the score of a game, perhaps it should be no surprise that an app called TheScore can give it to you. Select your favorite teams on TheScore's iPhone app, and all their games will show up on the Watch. Scores are displayed in a way that's easy to read, and you can tap in on most games to get brief breakdowns of how it all unfolded. It doesn't provide quite the level of detail that a sports fan might want, but it should be enough to satiate a quick curiosity about a game.   The highly addictive iPhone game is likely to get even more addictive for players who own an Apple Watch. Trivia Crack translates really well to the small screen since its gameplay is so simple. You do, unfortunately, have to start new games on the phone, but games can last a long time, so you won't have to constantly pull it out of your pocket to keep playing. Each turn can take from a few seconds to a few minutes, which makes Trivia Crack the perfect bite-sized interruption when you have a moment to kill.   If you already have a fitness app of choice, it's unlikely that any Apple Watch apps are going to change your mind. But if you're picking one out just for the Apple Watch, it's worth taking a look at Runtastic. Runtastic does two things right that a lot of fitness apps do wrong: it can track multiple types of workouts, and it displays all of the information you want to see on a single page (that's a recurring theme in this app roundup, if you haven't noticed). You aren't going to want to be swiping side to side on your wrist in the middle of a run, and a lot of fitness apps right now — including Apple's — require you to do that if you want to see all of your basic stats. With Runtastic, your distance traveled, time elapsed, and pace are all displayed at once. If you're okay with a little swiping, you can access music controls one screen over. Nike+ Running is another good option here that includes a single-screen display and music controls, but — as the name suggests — it's only good if you're running.   This one is only for the business users who are already addicted to Slack, but it's a complete must-have for them. The app is really simple, giving you access to recent moments when your name was mentioned and a list of your private messages. You can dictate replies, but the most important thing to know is that one of the built-in responses is the shruggie. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯    The Apple Watch is easily among the nerdiest watches in the world, and yet it somehow doesn't include a calculator. Also surprising: calculators are kind of hard to do on a smartwatch. So far, Calculator+ is the best we've seen, though that's not saying a ton. It's responsive, and it makes it easy to plug in operators. On top of all that — and this may sound silly — it's really nice that the app offers different color schemes so that you can match your Watch (though it seems to forget which one you've selected after a few hours). I'm kind of digging the purple one. If you're going to wear a smartwatch, own the nerdiness and get a calculator app.",0.6394891954928883,0.3605108045071117,0.15664850217645251,1596,4.4172932330827068,657,5.9802130898021311,1,10,"Apple, Apps, Tech",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The station had an inauspicious start: during liftoff, vibrations caused a meteoroid shield to rip off and made one of the two primary solar arrays unusable. Turning the second array towards the sun without the shield led temperatures inside the craft to rise to over 125 degrees Fahrenheit. The only thing that saved it from becoming permanently uninhabitable was the work of NASA engineers and a three-man crew, who performed an unplanned spacewalk to repair it. Over the next year, three teams would spend a total of 171 days in space performing experiments and maintaining the station. Though it was supposed to remain in orbit for eight to ten years afterwards, Skylab didn't last that long. By 1977, its orbit was no longer stable, and in 1979 it was sent back into Earth's atmosphere, where pieces of it fell across the Indian Ocean and parts of western Australia. But it opened the door to future programs, including the International Space Station in use today.

Researchers have been aware of a possible discrepancy in sea level rise measurements due to the outlet glaciers for a while now, but this team is the first to fully address it.

Kepler first launched in 2009, and its primary mission ended in 2012. It then entered an extended mission period, with funding earmarked until 2016. But if a solution is not found, that lifespan may be much shorter. These problems with the reaction wheel have been ongoing: in January, NASA suspended operations for ten days, attempting to resolve abnormally high levels of friction. The issue, though, continued after it resumed, despite attempts to better lubricate the wheel. Without three wheels, Kepler can't point itself effectively enough to make the fine observations needed to find exoplanets. NASA is still investigating whether a two-wheeled craft could be used for other tasks that require less precision. Despite the failure, NASA says it still has a surprising amount of torque on the wheels, and it's considering the possibility of getting the first failed wheel to start turning again. If it can't, scientists say there's still a wealth of data — two years' worth, in fact — left to be processed. ""I'm very optimistic that the data that we have"" will allow for the discovery of more planets, said one participant during the briefing. Since its launch, Kepler has discovered a number of planets that share characteristics with Earth, looking for telltale anomalies that could indicate a planetary orbit. In April, the mission found two ""Super Earths"" inside a star's habitable zone, the orbital area that could support liquid water. Most importantly, though, it's found that smaller planets are not nearly as unusual as once assumed, and that many more could be found in the future. Regardless of whether Kepler can be resurrected, more planet-hunting projects are in the works.

The process cannot be used to create full human clones, as the scientists involved were quick to point out, but it does allow for cells to be grown to fit specific functions within an individual's body — resulting in new, patient-specific liver cells or heart cells that actually pulse on their own, for example.    ""we believe this is a significant step forward."" Eventually, scientists hope to refine the process to the point it could be used to help treat disease and even create whole custom organs, but that is likely to be several years away at the earliest. ""While there is much work to be done in developing safe and effective stem cell treatments, we believe this is a significant step forward in developing the cells that could be used in regenerative medicine,"" said Shoukhrat Mitalipov, the leader of the research team and a senior scientist at the Oregon National Primate Research Center (ONPRC), in a news release. The research team was led by scientists at the Oregon Health & Science University, who used a technique similar to the one that created Dolly the sheep, the first mammal cloned from adult cells, back in 1996. In a basic sense, this method involves taking an adult cell from a patient's body, sucking out the central portion containing DNA (the nucleus), then injecting this material into an empty egg cell donated by another human volunteer. The genetic material from the adult cell tells the empty egg cell what type it should mature into. Genetic material tells the empty cell what to mature into      Many other scientific teams tried and failed to use this process to clone human cells over the years, and although other groups did manage to get it working in monkeys, the new research results are the first successful time the process has been successful for human cells.  The team was able to overcome previous failures by using a chemical reaction to slow down one phase of a human cell's natural process of dividing into more copies of itself. They reported their work in a paper published online today in the journal Cell. Relies on unfertilized eggs from human donors  Importantly, the process uses relies on human reproductive eggs donated by female volunteers, but which have not been fertilized, meaning they are not able to mature into full human babies if left on their own. The unfertilized eggs used in this study were donated by several young women recruited through a university program and paid between $3,000 and $7,000 in compensation. The researchers behind the new work say the fact the donor cells were unfertilized should help avoid the ongoing controversy over other previous research involving the destruction of fertilized embryos, which are able grow into full human beings if left up to nature. But other scientists aren't so sure, telling NPR the advance is likely to reignite the debate.

He believes in it so strongly that he doesn’t believe people even need to take a pill in order to produce a positive placebo effect; an app with a picture of a pill will do. That’s the basis of his startup, Placebo Effect, which is raising $50,000 through the crowdfunding site Indiegogo to build his prototype into an iPhone app that he says can harness the placebo effect in order to help people make positive changes in their lives, such as feeling happier or quitting smoking.  New research shows deception may not be necessary for the placebo effect The app offers a variety of ""placebos,"" including images of a pill, a magic wand, a communion wafer, and other options. ""Placebo pills are actually chosen often. About 12 percent of people in our testing choose pills,"" he said. ""The reason for that probably is that in our society, we feel that pills work really well."" He’s done limited testing with good results, he said, and plans to do more. So far, 39 people self-reported an average of 31 percent increase in the effect they were trying to create in their lives, for example joy, energy, physical healing, or love, after one use. Seven users reported no change, and one person reported a negative change and did not complete the trial. Jacobs’ idea may sound a bit bogus, especially since it is widely believed that the placebo effect only works if the patient believes he or she is taking a real treatment. This perceived need for deception is part of the reason doctors don’t prescribe placebos, despite the fact that they can occasionally work as well as FDA-approved treatments for some conditions.     However, new research suggests deception may not be necessary to induce a placebo effect. In 2010, researchers from Harvard Medical School and other institutions did a study on patients diagnosed with Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS). One group received no treatment, while the other patients were told they’d be taking inactive drugs and told that placebos can have healing effects. To drive the point home, the fake drugs were placed in bottles labeled ""placebo pills."" The patients who knew they were taking placebo pills reported twice as much relief as the control group. The placebo had healing effects comparable to some of the best real IBS drugs. ""Our results challenge ‘the conventional wisdom’ that placebo effects require ‘intentional ignorance,’"" the researchers wrote. Placebos are used to test treatments, but in the future they could be the treatment If placebos could be effectively prescribed without the need to lie to patients, it would be revolutionary. Placebos are cheaper and safer than many treatments. Studies have shown placebos to be 75 percent as effective as antidepressants. Fake surgeries have been shown to be just as effective as real surgeries in treating Parkinson’s. Today placebos are used to test treatments, but in the future they could be the treatment. Some doctors are already prescribing placebos this way. ""We should be using every tool in the box,"" Ted Kaptchuk, a Harvard professor, leading placebo effect researcher, and alternative medicine expert, told Harvard Magazine. Kaptchuk worked on the IBS study that showed a placebo effect even when patients knew they were taking a placebo. He now runs the Program in Placebo Studies and the Therapeutic Encounter (PiPS) at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, a group dedicated to placebo research. The placebo effect varies from person to person, and some may be genetically predisposed to it. The type of placebo and the condition also matter: pills work better for insomnia, studies have found, while injections work better for pain. It's also important not to cause the nocebo effect, in which patients suffer the same harmful side effects associated with a real medication, for example, even when taking the fake version. It works like the placebo effect but induces negative reactions instead of positive ones. ""Placebo"" translates to ""I will please"" in Latin. ""Nocebo"" translates to ""I will harm."" Kaptchuk and his colleagues have plenty of critics within the FDA, the pharmaceutical industry, and academia. A group of Danish researchers conducted a meta-analysis in 2001 and again in 2004, concluding that there is ""little evidence in general that placebos had powerful clinical effects."" It’s also unclear how much of the measured effects are due to the placebo effect, and how much might be due to other factors. It’s been suggested that patients experiencing improvement could be have a reporting bias, for example, that skews in favor of the result they believe will please their doctors. ""This is extremely effective."" As to whether the placebo effect can be simulated by an app, more research is needed there too. (Due to the lack of empirical evidence, Kaptchuk declined to comment, via his program manager, on whether an app could induce the placebo effect.) ""What we’re not saying here is, ‘stop taking your antidepressants and to then do this instead,’"" Jacobs said. ""What we are saying is that the literature shows, and our own internal studies, and later on, clinical trials that we will surely do, that this is extremely effective. It would be wonderful if you could complement this with whatever else you’re doing in life.""",0.6251021228247094,0.37489787717529055,0.17313210223958853,920,5.0956521739130434,464,6.2650862068965516,0,0,"Apps, Science, Report",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers — the gender discrimination lawsuit that cracked Silicon Valley’s claim to meritocracy like an iPhone screen — began a week ago in San Francisco Superior Court. Entire afternoons of testimony have fixated on the financial perks of being one of the (mostly male) senior partners at the celebrated venture capital firm, or the potential fivefold increase in income for (mostly male) ""managing members,"" who get to make decisions about a particular Kleiner fund and share in its profits. That’s just a peek at the cloistered habits of venture capitalists revealed in this trial. Normally, discussion of titles at venture firms is taboo. You’d be hard-pressed to find a LinkedIn profile that admits to being a ""junior partner"" or a ""managing member."" And the ""team"" pages of top VC firms like Kleiner only obfuscate the issue. Are the female faces as powerful as the men in the head shots all around them? Probably not, but before Pao filed her industry-quaking lawsuit in 2012, the lack of women investors — at any pay grade — was rarely discussed.  Pao’s case is often mistaken for a sexual harassment lawsuit. The complaint alleges that Kleiner retaliated against Pao because she reported being pressured into an affair by Ajit Nazre, a married coworker who had a ""strong influence"" on Kleiner partners. But Pao’s short-term affair with Nazre in 2006 was consensual. He wasn’t fired until another female junior partner reported unwanted sexual advances from Nazre. Pao, who is currently the interim CEO of Reddit, is suing for discrimination, alleging that Kleiner held back other women on the investing side based on gender. Pao's case is often mistaken for a sexual harassment lawsuitShe is asking for $16 million in damages for lost wages and ""carried interest"" from profitable investments. Pao’s attorney Alan Exelrod has described how Pao was excluded from business events and limited in the number of investments she could make each year. But performance reviews cite her lack of experience — the ""thousand tiny paper cuts"" familiar to any woman in the industry. Meanwhile, when Lynne Hermle, Kleiner’s charismatic counsel, is asking the questions, it sounds like senior management liked every woman except Pao, who just couldn’t cut it as a VC. But gender bias is for the jury to decide. Regardless of the outcome, courtroom testimony has already helped expose the highly competitive and capricious process that determines which technologies and founders get funded, and who gets to get rich off the next Google, Amazon, Uber, or Snapchat (all Kleiner investments). The trial is expected to last five weeks. Billionaire John Doerr, Kleiner’s best known personal brand and a father figure to Pao, is on the stand right now, and Mary ""Queen of the Internet"" Meeker is still to come. Here’s what we've learned so far. Before she was fired (or ""transitioned out"") of Kleiner in 2012, Ellen Pao was making $560,000 a year, between her base salary ($400,000) and annual bonus ($160,000). It’s but a fraction compared to her male peers whose take-home pay ballooned to as much as five times that after they were promoted to senior partners and attached to one of Kleiner’s funds as a ""managing member,"" an ownership role that allowed them to start receiving ""net fee"" income, or a share in profits. Men made up to five times more after being promoted On the stand, Kleiner CFO Susan Biglieri, who has worked for the firm for 25 years, was asked by what multiple had compensation increased for three men after they were promoted: Amol Deshpande (Biglieri said four times; the judge interjected and said more like five times), Wen Hsieh (about three times), and Chi Hua-Chien (about four times). The implication is that Pao could have made as much $2.8 million a year. She worked at the firm for seven years. All three of those men were promoted in 2012, despite Pao’s seniority. Like Pao, Hsieh had also started out in the ""chief of staff"" role, assisting Doerr. When Chien was on the stand, we also heard about a Kleiner-sponsored ski trip where employees and those associated were flown to Vail on a private jet and provided a dinner at Al Gore’s condo at the St. Regis in San Francisco. Gore is a partner at Kleiner. Pao, who was not invited, also lived at the hotel. Two can play at the discovery game. Kleiner’s lawyers used the trial as a reason to peek into Reddit’s finances, arguing that the amount Pao stands to make from the so-called front page of the internet should offset damages, according to The Wall Street Journal. Reddit, however, is not one of those billion-dollar unicorns trumpeting its valuation. Normally the bigger the company, the better, but Pao is more likely to win her $16 million if Reddit is perceived as being worth less. In a pretrial hearing, Kleiner’s attorney pointed to the $500 million valuation reported as part of the $50 million Reddit raised in September from the likes of Peter Thiel and Marc Andreessen, as well as Jared Leto and Snoop Dogg. Pao’s lawyers said an expert had valued the company about half that amount. Kleiner fought hard to exclude other harassment complaints against Nazre, so it was a shock when former partner Trae Vassallo took the stand on the first day of arguments to testify. An independent investigation found that Nazre had repeatedly crossed a line in his behavior towards Vassallo, but not Pao. (Both investigations were conducted in 2012 because Pao only formalized a complaint after she heard Vassallo went through a similar experience.) A surprise witness for the accuser The first instance of harassment towards Vassallo was in 2009 when, she said, ""he started touching me with his leg under the table,"" during what was supposed to be a meeting to talk about Kleiner’s green-tech investments.   During a business trip to New York, Nazre told Vassallo he was going to introduce her to an influential connection, but the restaurant reservations were for two, and the executive never materialized. Half an hour after dinner, Nazre showed up at her hotel room door in a bathrobe and slippers. Eventually, she was able to ""push him"" out of the door. Vassallo also said general partner Ray Lane, a close and treasured mentor with whom she had an ""awesome"" relationship, told her she ""should be flattered."" Lane denied saying that, telling Exelrod, ""It’s just not me."" But Stephen Hirschfeld, the lawyer who conducted the independent investigations, recalled Vassallo communicating something to that effect. Held back from a promotion The inclusion of her testimony is instructive not only because it establishes Nazre as a predator, who took advantage of Kleiner’s inaction on Pao’s complaints about retaliation, but also because Vassallo was clearly well-liked at the firm. Both Lane and Schlein spoke highly of her personality, where communicating with Pao made them bristle. Despite her promise and interpersonal skills, Vassallo was also held back from promotion to senior partner in 2011. Kleiner laid out its plan to attack Pao’s capabilities as an investor in the trial brief filed last month. According to the firm, Pao’s electrical engineering degree from Princeton, a law degree and MBA from Harvard, and stints at a handful of tech companies did not give her the skills needed to be a good board member or help portfolio companies.  Much of the testimony has involved parsing Pao’s performance reviews, which Exelrod maintains contained input from Nazre, even after she reported his retaliatory behavior. Even Mary Meeker had a hard time But it’s a powerful thing to hear that Mary Meeker and Aileen Lee, two of the best-known female venture capitalists, also had a tougher time getting promoted than their male counterparts at Kleiner. Lee, who founded a fund of her own called Cowboy Ventures in 2012, was never made a managing member at Kleiner. Yesterday, Exelrod produced a document from November 2011 indicating that Meeker was not initially a managing member on Kleiner’s Digital Growth Fund, responsible for its investments in Spotify and Waze, despite the fact that she headed up the fund. Judge Harold Kahn allows jurors to submit questions when testimony is unclear, and they’ve proven themselves to be exceedingly sharp, probing around the issue of how subjective perceptions of success can be at Kleiner.   One of yesterday’s questions involved how carried interest is divided among partners. Kahn, who reads the jurors' questions, asked if ""any objectivity or mathematics"" were brought to bear when managing members divvy up carried interest. ""There’s not some input to an equation,"" Schlein replied. It was hard not to think back to that when Lane, Nazre’s mentor, explained why Nazre was allowed to stick around after initially lying to him about the affair with Pao. Months after he found out about the affair, Nazre was promoted to senior partner with Lane's support. When 'cocky' counts against you Another question yesterday concerned Schlein’s notes on a potential male hire from 2011 that seemed to imply the candidate’s ""cockiness"" was an attribute. (Many of Pao’s performance reviews called her arrogant and brash, noting her ""sharp elbows,"" where similar aggression in partners like Chien was not a cause for concern.) Schlein was asked to explain when cockiness is a good thing. ""If you’re cocky and then by the time you’re done talking to somebody and they don’t like you,"" it’s the wrong kind of cocky, he said. Testimony from his partners made it clear that Doerr was one of Pao's only supervisors who liked her, or had faith in her, but with his firm's reputation on the line, we'll see how much he is able to ""recall"" in court.

Target isn't the only one under investigation Krebs on Security explains that Fazio Mechanical could have had access to Target's network for maintenance purposes. It's common practice for large companies to hire teams to monitor energy consumption in stores to help save on energy costs. Those teams need to have remote access to the company's network, so that is one way the HVAC company could have had long-term access to Target's system. However, that does not explain why the retailer's maintenance network led the hackers to its payment network. It's possible that Target had the maintenance and payment networks connected, making it easy for hackers to access one from the other. But Krebs alluded to an even more unsettling scenario — the networks could have been separated from the start, but the hackers found a way to connect them. well @johnbumgarner it is possible that they *were* segmented, but that the bad guys figured out how to bridge them.  Fazio Mechanical president Ross Fazio confirmed that the US Secret Service — which has not been shy about its investigation — has visited the company's offices while investigating the Target breach. It makes sense for the Department of Justice to take a hard look at Fazio: the HVAC contractor has completed projects for Trader Joe’s, Whole Foods, BJ’s Wholesale Club, and others, suggesting those companies could be susceptible to similar attacks. While the identities of the hackers are still unknown, this discovery shows how even the most tangental connection to a huge company like Target could open the door for hackers to access information.

The operations were carried out by the Joint Threat Research Intelligence Group (JTRIG), a division of the Government Communications Headquarters Communications (GCHQ), Britain's NSA-equivalent. A PowerPoint presentation for a 2012 NSA conference reveals that JTRIG launched a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack against the internet relay chat (IRC) rooms used by members of Anonymous. The attack was part of an operation called ""Rolling Thunder,"" and was reportedly launched following Anonymous' 2011 DDoS attack on PayPal and major credit card companies. Some so-called ""hacktivists"" targeted the websites of the FBI, CIA, and GCHQ as part of Anonymous' ""Operation Payback,"" staged in protest against the prosecution of Chelsea Manning.   ""an appalling example of overreacting in order to squash dissent."" JTRIG agents, posing as Anonymous members, also infiltrated IRC rooms to identify hackers who had stolen personal data or attacked government websites. This week's report marks the first time that JTRIG's existence has been publicly disclosed. The documents obtained by NBC News reveal that it was created to execute covert computer attacks, and that the division's tactics include phone jamming and undercover ploys. A presentation titled ""Pushing the Boundaries and Action Against Hacktivism"" lists Anonymous, LulzSec, and the Syrian Electronic Army as major hacktivist groups. Under Rolling Thunder, JTRIG operatives used Facebook, Twitter, and other online networks to warn suspected hacktivists that ""DDOS and hacking is illegal, please cease and desist."" The presentation claims that the dissuasion tactics were effective, noting that 80 percent of those contacted disappeared from IRC rooms within one month. The operation identified members who had staged attacks against government or corporate websites, and led to the conviction of one hacker who stole 8 million identities on PayPal. ""officials must be able to pursue individuals who are going far beyond speech."" Gabriella Coleman, author of a forthcoming book on Anonymous, says the GCHQ went too far, telling NBC News that the operation amounted to a crackdown on civil disobedience rather than suspected terrorists, implicating a handful of criminals at the expense of thousands. ""Punishing thousands of people, who are engaging in their democratic right to protest, because a couple people committed vandalism is … an appalling example of overreacting in order to squash dissent,"" Coleman said. Michael Leiter, former head of the US National Counterterrorism Center, agrees that groups shouldn't be targeted for their political beliefs, but doesn't think that should negate the government's ability to identify cybercriminals online. ""While there must of course be limitations, law enforcement and intelligence officials must be able to pursue individuals who are going far beyond speech and into the realm of breaking the law: defacing and stealing private property that happens to be online,"" Leiter told NBC News.

The bill was passed late Wednesday by the Turkish Parliament and is expected to be signed into law by President Abdullah Gul. Supporters of the measure say it will help protect children from ""items on the internet that encourage drug addiction, sexual abuse and suicide,"" and that it was designed to strengthen privacy protection. But opposition leaders and human rights groups have roundly denounced the law, describing it as an attack on free speech. Last month, an estimated 2,000 demonstrators took to the streets of Ankara and Istanbul to protest against the internet bill, prompting riot police to retaliate with rubber bullets, water cannons, and tear gas. Under the law, Turkey's telecommunications authority will be allowed to unilaterally block websites that are deemed to violate user privacy or contain ""insulting"" materials. It also requires internet service providers (ISPs) to retain data on its customers' web activities for up two years, and to make that data available to the government upon request. It does not require the government to notify customers when their web data is seized, or obtain a court order before issuing a request.   ""Remember that Adolf Hitler used the same methods when he rose to power.""   The move comes at a delicate moment for Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan whose ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) is still battling a massive corruption scandal that erupted in December. Opposition groups have accused Erdoğan of growing increasingly authoritarian since coming into office in 2003, pointing to recent media crackdowns and controversial domestic policies. Political tensions exploded in June of last year, when massive anti-Erdoğan protests unfolded across the country. As Wednesday's parliamentary debate proved, relations between the prime minister and opposition parties remain as acrimonious as ever. ""When you came to power you talked of enhancing democracy in Turkey, now you are trying to implement fascism,"" opposition lawmaker Hasan Oren said of Erdoğan during last night's debate over the internet bill. ""Remember that Adolf Hitler used the same methods when he rose to power."" Erdoğan has adopted a hardline stance on both the internet and domestic media during his time in office. Last June, as protests against his administration were just gaining momentum, he described social media as ""the worst menace to society,"" and his government has routinely used filters to block thousands of sites, usually without explanation. According to a 2013 report from the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), Turkey has imprisoned more journalists than any other country over the past two years, surpassing China and Iran. ""any dissenting voice can now be 'lawfully' silenced."" The law passed yesterday builds on a controversial 2007 measure that expanded the state's power to block certain websites. Experts say that the latest legislation was likely motivated by politics, rather than privacy or social concerns, as Erdoğan and his AKP allies look to maintain power amidst a widening graft probe that has already forced several high-ranking officials and cabinet members to resign. Several websites have published recordings of Erdoğan and AKP ministers speaking with businessmen, describing them as proof of the party's corruption, though their authenticity has yet to be verified. ""Internet for the government seems to have become a state security matter rather than a social issue,"" Buket Bora, research coordinator at the London-based Centre for Turkey Studies and editor of the CEFTUS Insights website, says in an email to The Verge. Bora adds that in light of the new powers that the law grants the federal government, ""it could be claimed that any corruption allegations against the government and any dissenting voice can now be 'lawfully' silenced.""",0.6391852005698241,0.3608147994301759,0.8554344664809473,670,5.4238805970149251,389,6.5167095115681235,0,0,"Policy & Law, US & World, Web",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

Ohio officials used an untested cocktail of lethal drugs on an inmate in January, to macabre results. Now Virginia has proposed a bill that would mean inmates will be sent to the electric chair if sufficient amounts of lethal injection drugs can't be found. While Virginia hasn't questioned the legality of the electric chair since 1921, courts in other states, such as Georgia and Nebraska, have classed it as cruel and unusual punishment. The proposed bill would make Virginia the only state in the US in which a death row prisoner could be forced into death by electrocution. It has already passed the state's House of Delegates, and according to The Washington Post, is likely to go up for state lawmakers to vote on this week. Currently, Virginian inmates sentenced to execution are able to choose between lethal injection and electrocution. If no choice is made, the lethal cocktail will be administered. If the new law passes, officials will be able to force inmates to be executed by electric chair if lethal injection drugs aren't available, or the prisoner declines to choose. If the bill passes, officials will be able to force inmates to be executed by electrocution In previous years, many states used Nembutal, a brand name for the drug pentobarbital, for their lethal injections. But the drug's Danish manufacturer banned its export for use in human executions in 2011, and since then, state governments have drained their supplies. Nembutal supplies are unlikely to be restocked: even when the Danish company that made the drug sold the rights for its manufacture to a drug maker based in Illinois, it wrote a catch into the contract that prohibited its use for human executions. State governments have yet to come up with a long-term plan to make up for the lack of Nembutal. Officials in Texas were forced to use a supply of the drug that had passed its expiration date to kill convicted murderer Arturo Diaz last year. Sedative propofol has been proposed as an alternative for lethal injections, but its use has been denounced by American Society of Anesthesiologists. In October, 2013, Missouri officials backed away from a plan that would've seen the drug used in the execution of convicted killer Allen Nicklassen. Virginia has executed 110 people since 1976 Virginia's Department of Corrections has explored using other drugs in its lethal injections. The Washington Post says the department purchased doses of the same drugs used in Ohio's reportedly botched execution of convicted rapist and murderer Dennis McGuire, as well as a ""new three-drug mixture."" But, in addition to concerns about these new cocktails' efficiency, state officials haven't been able to secure consistent supplies of either mixture. Virginia is tied for second in total executions in the United States, having put 110 people to death since 1976. The chair is still commonly used as an execution method in the state: three of the last six Virginia executions were by electrocution. The Washington Post quotes Debra Gardner, chief deputy director of the Department of Corrections, who says the method leaves only ""minor burns, just barely noticeable."" Ron Elkins, the commonwealth's attorney from Virginia's Wise County, said, ""Having been there and watched it, it was not as dramatic as it's portrayed on television."" But others, including Richard Dieter, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center, have pushed for state governments to research new and efficient drugs for production. Even attempts to copy the pentobarbital previously used in lethal injections have been less than entirely successful. In January, convicted murderer Michael Lee Wilson was heard to say ""I feel my whole body burning"" 20 seconds after being injected with a version of the drug created at an unnamed pharmacy.",0.2909002724796841,0.7090997275203159,0.8461967174953892,647,5.1530139103554866,337,6.2077151335311571,0,0,"Policy & Law, US & World",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

I’m going to sound a little excited now. Earlier today Oculus announced Story Studio, its in-house production team dedicated to producing virtual reality movies. We’ve been seeing VR narrative experiences for years at this point, and while they’ve been getting more and more impressive, they’ve still been iterative steps forward. Despite how much we’ve all wanted to it to happen, nothing has stood up, raised its hands, and shouted ""I’m the project that proves this crazy thing could actually work."" I just watched Lost, the first short from Story Studio. That stand up and shout moment? It’s arrived. The stand up and shout moment has arrived I slipped the goggles over my head — the experience is built for the Oculus Crescent Bay prototype, so it’s lighter than previous versions and can track you as you stand up and move around. Lost starts with the Story Studio logo, and then the real fun begins. You start in a darkened space, and then a pinpoint of light appears: it’s a firefly, buzzing playfully up towards you. You soon realize you’re looking at a forest, and then the movie’s opening credits start as light strings swell in the background. The sound and credits are key; my first thought was this actually feels like a movie! That was enough to get me excited, and then I started to hear the buzzing and chirping of the forest. That’s when I turned around and realized I was actually there. Now, the sense of immersion isn’t new to Lost. Anybody that’s tried the Rift knows the feeling, but the use of credits and music played off my preconceived notions of what I was watching. My brain triggered off them, informing me it was a movie, and then that movie seemed to spill out across my entire field of view. The imagery, while not photorealistic, took advantage of being animated to overcome many of the resolution problems that can plague other VR demos.   The story itself is light and playful, director Saschka Unseld demonstrating the same whimsy and heart as in his Pixar short The Blue Umbrella. I heard a sound to my right, and when I looked over I realized there was a giant… thing… jerking to life. It was a severed robot hand, lost out here in the middle of the woods. The hand slowly pulled itself into my main field of view — the movie does still suffer a bit from the staginess of some VR in that there’s clearly a cleared space ahead of you to direct your field of view — but I was so charmed by what was happening that I hardly noticed. The hand flexed its digits, poking around, clearly in search of someone. Its owner. A red sensor wagged like a dog’s tail, a Pixar-like touch that gave it a sense of adorable personality. The image got blurry — I was smiling too much That’s when the image got slightly blurry. The Oculus unit had shifted slightly on my face. I was smiling too big. A sharp light hit the trees high above me. Then a loud thud. And another. I crouched down, briefly wondering why the ground wasn’t vibrating. (Ballroom floors in Park City don’t usually vibrate; who knew?) I tried to hide behind a fern The hand’s red-sensor tail started wagging wildly, an excited dog happy its owner was home. And that’s when I saw the robot, its enormous shoulders cresting the treetops high above me. I tried to hide behind a fern. The hand may have been happy, but a lifetime of sci-fi has told me that giant robots are generally bad news. Hand and owner were reunited as the robot stood tall above me. I still thought I could get away with this hiding thing, crouching on my knees in the digital flora. Then two big bright eyes caught my attention. The robot was crouching above, looking right at me. He had a strange mechanical smile on his face, more Iron Giant than Gort. That smiling problem started happening again — and then the credits rolled. I’ve never been so frustrated that I had to leave a VR experience.  After taking the Rift off it took me several moments to articulate how I felt. (""What’d you think?"" a fellow journalist asked afterwards. My response: ""Dude."") The truth is the story in Lost is simple; it’s about a missing hand that finds its owner — but those same simple stories have been charming audiences for years before Pixar and Disney movies. We don’t need a two-hour Michael Bay epic to prove that narrative VR is worthy of being A Thing™. All that’s needed is a true story with a beginning, middle, and end; characters we can relate to; and a sense of immersion and interactivity. I was there, within the story Lost delivers that. I was there, within the story. The robot hand was cute and charming (and so was its owner). And while I (thankfully) felt the presence of a storyteller behind what I was seeing, the events were being tailored to me in real time. (The robot hand never pops up unless I look towards it, Unseld told me afterward, and the playful firefly was responding to my movements in real time, both encouraging me to look in certain directions and drawing me into the story as a companion.)  Saschka Unseld Oculus is being cautious with Lost, setting expectations quite low, and it’s very clear that these experiences are currently best done in short bursts; we’re far away from half-hour or movie-length virtual reality stories. But the truth is Lost is the most complete VR narrative that’s been created thus far. It’s a project that sweeps aside several concerns, provides an emotional experience for the viewer, and is able to be both familiar and totally new. But despite those accomplishments, Unseld told me he wasn’t quite happy with the finished product. The short isn’t immersive enough, he told me, and needs to do a better job of fully engaging audiences in three-dimensional space. Oculus hopes to release four more movies this year Oculus Story Studio hopes to release four more VR cinema experiences this year, so they’ll have plenty of time to improve. Those titles include Bullfighter, which takes place in the precise kind of arena that you’d expect, a comedy about a hedgehog with a balloon fascination called Henry, and Unseld’s next project Dear Angelica. With the entire point of the presentation at Sundance to entice new filmmakers to take what Oculus has done and create their own experiences, it looks like there could be quite a few VR cinema experiences for the Rift’s consumer version… whenever it arrives.",0.6338748635804912,0.36612513641950883,0.17088276834245028,1133,4.7272727272727275,579,5.9792746113989637,0,4,"Culture, Entertainment, Tech, Film, Hands-on",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

I had a ticket for the premiere of Me and Earl and the Dying Girl but decided to skip it in order to finish writing; the teen leukemia dramedy was not particularly high priority for me, despite the presence of likable adults Connie Britton, Nick Offerman, and Molly Shannon. So I stayed typing at the Park City Marriott, and about two hours later, Sundance Twitter lost its mind.  I think Me, Earl and the Dying Girl has replaced Dope as my favorite film of #Sundance2015 so far.  Me and Earl and The Dying Girl just punched over a thousand people in the heart. Followed by a much deserved standing ovation. #Sundance  Credits still rolling and Me and Earl and the Dying Girl is getting a standing ovation in the dark. Crying too hard to type. #sundance Well, fuck. Why wasn't I crying too hard to type? I wanted to cry! Why did everyone else get to cry without me? A woman next to me looking at her phone sighed ""shit, I think we have to see Me and Earl and the Dying Girl."" She wasn't talking to me, but I did as she said. I quickly rearranged my schedule to accommodate an evening press screening and a 1.5 hour line encampment to ensure I'd get in. This ended up being not at all overkill, because word got out, and by 6 p.m. I was at the front of a huge line of journalists all waiting for the tear-stained cure for their FOMO. I've obviously been thinking a lot about expectations at the festival, and I try to check mine thoroughly before every screening. I want to be open, I want to be curious, I want to be flexible. Honestly, I want to be a pushover. It would be so fun to like everything I saw! And then a film like Me and Earl and the Dying Girl comes along and makes me feel not only like a joyless hater, but a lonely joyless hater. A film described as ""The Fault In Our Stars meets Michel Gondry"" is not something I should see without the aid of heavy sedatives I should have known better, honestly. A film described as ""The Fault In Our Stars meets Michel Gondry"" is not something I should see without the aid of heavy sedatives. But director Alfonso Gomez-Rejon did some great technical filmmaking on the otherwise laughable American Horror Story: Coven, and I'm usually down for more teen movie angst than the average filmgoer. And while Me and Earl and the Dying Girl has some virtuosic visual moments, especially in its opening minutes, it gives way to empty, maudlin quirk and a barrage of film nerd references seemingly included just so a Sundance audience could chuckle to themselves self-congratulatingly. I left the film before the credits rolled so that I could get back in line for a screening of Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief, which I had been booted out of at the overbooked madhouse of a premiere. I sat there in the tent for another hour, not so much stewing about Earl as feeling profoundly alienated from my fellow festivalgoers. (I hadn't even gotten the news that it was picked up by Fox Searchlight for a Sundance record of $12 million. So now I just give up.) It was Day 4 and I still hadn't found my movie. I'm still pretty positive my movie is Tangerine, a Los Angeles street fable shot entirely on an iPhone 5S, which I will not be able to see before I leave the festival. Such are the logistical cruelties of the festival. Going Clear is strong, though it won't offer as many mind-blowing revelations for anyone who's spent any amount of time getting lost in Scientology YouTube rabbit holes, or anyone who has read Lawrence Wright's book on which the film is based. The one moment that made me audibly ""wow"" was the breakdown of the Church's finances, aided largely by its tax-exempt status as a religious organization and virtually free labor from its non-celebrity members. (The Church currently claims only 50,000 members, but has $1.5 billion in assets.) The Church's years-long war against the IRS in the early '90s is a particular focus of the film — members filed hundreds of lawsuits against individual IRS officials and eventually bullied their way out of a billion dollar tax bill. In one particularly insane piece of archival footage, leader David Miscavige addresses thousands of members at a rally to announce their victory against the government. Fireworks go off, and an arena full of Scientologists lose their collective shit. It's one of those great documentary moments where you realize that something absolutely insane is happening on the very same planet you live and breathe on right now. Something absolutely insane is happening on the very same planet you live and breathe on right now Stories from lapsed members, especially Spanky Taylor, a publicist and former friend of John Travolta, are all varying shades of horrifying — Taylor had her child taken away from her as part of a church disciplinary action. The child was left horribly neglected in the notorious children's Cadet Org for months. The church has naturally launched a smear campaign against the film, though non-believers are unlikely to be swayed by it. I also checked out Hot Girls Wanted, an equally compelling documentary earlier in the day about the amateur porn business. I honestly wasn't sure what to make of this one going in — the press notes had me worried it would be a ""what's happening to our daughters"" handwringing concern-doc for the Lifetime set. But directors Jill Bauer and Ronna Gradus are up to something far more humane and nuanced. They embed themselves in a house in Miami run by a self-made ""talent agent"" and his rotating roster of 18 and 19 year old girls driven toward porn with dreams of riches, fame, and excitement. The girls are painted neither as sluts or as victims; they are frequently funny and self-aware, if woefully undereducated about the industry they want to get into (and basic sexual health.) A real-life Spring Breakers, if Spring Breakers was backed by the Kinsey Institute    In many ways Hot Girls Wanted, with its lurid Floridian backdrop and doofy male ringleader, is a real-life Spring Breakers, if Spring Breakers was directed by two women and backed by Kinsey Institute researchers. In the ""where are they now"" coda, it's revealed that most of the girls have dropped out of the business — their agent states earlier in the film that the average shelf life of an amateur porn star is about six months. In the post-film Q&A Bauer and Gradus said they had set out to make a Super Size Me of internet porn, and they are mostly successful. Hot Girls Wanted doesn't ask that we completely abstain from pornography as a society, but be more mindful of where our content is coming from.",0.1964803344214292,0.8035196655785708,0.36929309725611126,1191,4.6364399664147777,616,5.9821428571428568,0,0,"Culture, Entertainment, Film",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

In addition to producing new episodes of Tropes vs. Women in Video Games, Feminist Frequency is planning to begin two new video series: one that examines ""the representation of men and masculinity in video games"" and a miniseries that presents ""examples of positive female characters in video games.""

In a letter posted on her Kickstarter page, Sarkeesian describes how the goals of Feminist Frequency have changed due in part to both increased donations as well as, conversely, increased online harassment. ""While Tropes vs Women in Video Games was originally a project examining women's representations, the extreme harassment that I experience has become an intrinsic and inseparable part of this project, fundamentally changing my life and the landscape in which I release my videos. Gendered online harassment is not a new phenomenon, but the intensity of cyber mobs, especially in gaming, is increasing in frequency and severity. It became apparent to me that I should speak up and use my experience to help expose the epidemic of online abuse. Nearly half of my time is spent raising awareness on the epidemic of online harassment and working to help change policies on the institutional level. Some of these efforts are done publicly through Feminist Frequency's website and social media presence, as well as countless media interviews and at public speaking events. But there is also work being done behind the scenes in private meetings and consultations with major social media and gaming platforms, and by partnering with other organizations to form a task force with the goal of ending online harassment.""

Unlike the jetpack, this pulp fiction fantasy is now a reality. Except the Walkie-Talkie feature announced with the Apple Watch in September seems to have been pulled at the last minute. Remember that? Regardless of last minute changes, today’s the day we’ll look back upon as either the advent of wrist computing or just another consumer electronics folly. Remember when the industry made a coordinated push for 3D television? That was fun. The Apple Watch is far from the first wrist-worn computer. Samsung, and to a lesser degree LG, have kept the dream alive for years by showing off concepts at trade shows and releasing limited runs of Korea-only devices. Google gave the burgeoning category a much needed boost with the launch of Android Wear last year. Yet when was the last time you saw a normal wearing a Moto 360? Apple has a knack for turning nascent technologies into devices of mass consumption. The iPod wasn’t the first MP3 player. The iPhone wasn’t the first smartphone. The iPad wasn’t the first tablet.

A sign-up page for the beta went live but offers few details beyond the goal of building ""a new way for teams to write together."" A quick screenshot shows an interface that closely resembles Google Docs, with clear indicators showing multiple people working on editing a text document. There's no word yet on when this might launch or if it'll only be available to businesses who are signed up for Dropbox, but it's entirely possible this offering won't be consumer-focused. The beta signup page asks you to put in what company you work for, but Dropbox says that anyone is free to sign up for the beta, regardless of whether they work for a business that uses Dropbox.   This comes a few weeks after the first evidence of a new Dropbox note-taking platform came to light — as noted by TechCrunch, Dropbox Notes appears to be born out of the Hackpad service Dropbox purchased a year ago. Some users on Product Hunt found a way into a Dropbox-hosted tool called ""Project Composer"" but access was quickly closed down. The latest new market Dropbox is going after Regardless of its origin, expanding into collaborative notes makes a lot of sense for Dropbox — the company has long been trying to solve the problem of keeping Microsoft Office files shared between users in sync, with the most recent efforts involving a direct partnership between the two companies. Notes will certainly not be as robust as Word, but it could still be a good simple tool for collaborators to use without having to worry about version history. Still, there are already a host of collaboration services out there, so whether or not Notes will take off remains to be seen.

The burger was crafted using cells from the neck of a slaughterhouse cow and techniques developed for the creation of organs.

The ruling is a victory for agribusiness giant Monsanto, a US company that holds a patent on soybean seeds with genes that make plants resistant to Monsanto's popular weed killer, Roundup. Monsanto sued a rural Indiana farmer who purchased mixed soybean seeds from a secondary supplier, planted them, then used Roundup to wipe out all the plants that did not contain Monsanto's genetic modifications and saved the resulting new seeds to replant. The Supreme Court's ruling upholds an $84,000 fine against the farmer that was issued by a lower court. In a unanimous 9-0 ruling, the Supreme Court ruled that the farmer had violated Monsanto's patents and its agreement with customers that they repurchase new versions of the genetically-modified seeds every growing season, rather than harvesting seeds containing the genetic modifications from last season's crops. The Indiana farmer, 75-year-old Hugh Bowman, argued that his actions were legal under the longstanding doctrine of ""patent exhaustion,"" which gives a customer the right to resell a patented item without fear of infringement, so long as he or she purchased it legally in the first place. But the Supreme Court vehemently disagreed: ""Patent exhaustion does not permit a farmer to reproduce patented seeds through planting and harvesting without the patent holder’s permission,"" the Supreme Court said in its decision.

By discovering a new link, researchers could broaden their limited understanding of how genes relate to migraines. This newly identified potential migraine cause is believed to lie in a mutation of the gene ""casein kinase Iδ,"" which appeared to bring about the disorder (and in some instances a rare sleep issue) in two families that the team studied. The researchers' findings were published this month in Science Translational Medicine, and the team detailed how they tested their theory on mice.

According to Dr. Kevin Gurney, associate professor at Arizona State University, there are an estimated 30,000 fossil fuel-burning power plants spread throughout the world, but very little information on where they're located and the emissions they produce. So in order to gather that information, he and a team of climate science researchers at ASU have created a ""game"" — Ventus, a crowdsourced project powered with data gathered by ""citizen scientists.""    ""We have almost no other method by which to do this."" ""We have almost no other method by which to do this,"" Gurney tells The Verge. ""There is no authoritative international database with the necessary information."" While much of this information is available for plants in North America and Europe, elsewhere in the world it's much harder to come by. Essentially, Ventus — which is the Latin word for wind — is a website where anyone can enter data or add to existing data, either anonymously or by registering. You can enter the details of a plant's location as well as its annual CO2 emissions, the type of fuel it uses, and how much electricity it generates. In order to ensure the information is accurate, it will be compared against existing estimates and, hopefully, data from other users. Of course, the average person probably doesn't know much about the annual carbon emissions of their local power plant. While certain kinds of data — primarily location — are easy to come by for most users, others can be a bit more challenging. Gurney and his team are hoping that this problem will be solved in part by attracting ""power users"" to the project, ""who may very well be somebody in a federal government, maybe in an energy agency, who has the information and is able to give it to us."" But they're also betting that people who live near these plants will be able to fill in gaps. ""It's sort of like, the big factory down the street, do you know what they make?"" he says. ""If you live near one, you know that. And we're hoping that for every power plant, there are a dozen individuals that do know that — and we only need one.   ""We suspect we'll have multiple users giving us information for a single facility,"" adds Gurney, ""and through the act of having our own estimates and multiple individual estimates, we hope to be able to separate the wheat from the chaff."" The data will also be analyzed as it's being entered to make sure it's internally consistent — so if you input information on a plant's electrical capacity and generation, both of those things need to make sense relative to each other. ""It's going to improve climate projections into the future."" Ventus is described as a game, but it's only one in the loosest sense of the word. You'll receive points for entering usable data, and the person with highest total in 2014 will be labelled ""Supreme Power Plant Emissions Guru"" and receive an engraved trophy. While that might not sound as fun as playing Far Cry, Gurney is hoping that the real incentive for users will simply be the ability to help with a very real issue. ""I think that there are a surprising number of people who are both passionate and really interested in helping out in various ways,"" he tells The Verge. ""Not just in science, but particularly with the climate change problem. We're hoping to leverage that passion and that interest."" That citizen passion could eventually provide some of the necessary information used to answer fundamental questions of climate and carbon cycle science. ""It's going to improve climate projections into the future,"" says Gurney.

The Met maintains that, for now at least, the rest of their vast collection will stay put. ""There are no claims at all to speak of in the antiquities field,"" Harold Holzer, a senior spokesperson for the Met, told The Verge. But the incident raises a thorny question for museums in the US and Europe: how many of the objects in their collections were stolen or acquired illegally, and how many should be sent home?  ""There are no claims at all to speak of in the antiquities field."" For now, there’s no easy answer. The process of identifying museum objects that were stolen, and then returning them to their countries of origin, is called ""repatriation."" While the term describes restoring something to its point of origin, it’s also been used to describe sending prisoners of war back home. In more than one sense, that’s appropriate for museum artifacts, given that many famous works — like the Greek ""Elgin Marbles"" at the British Museum and ""Priam’s Treasure"" at the Pushkin Museum in Russia — were taken from their home countries by occupying armies or grabby colonial governments, mostly over the past 300 years. Photo of the disputed ""Elgin Marbles"" at the British Museum. (Credit: Phil Whitehouse, Flickr CC-by-2.0.)   Many of these objects were also looted by people within the countries of origin. But no matter who took them, they were often spirited away across several borders and then purchased by a series of private collectors. Those individuals later sold them to museums for vast sums, maintaining that the objects were legally acquired. This makes it difficult to pinpoint the true origins of artifacts or the validity of claims to ownership. Indeed, the Archaeological Institute of America, a nonprofit group representing archaeologists in the US, estimates that as many of 85-90 percent of ""classical and certain other types of artifacts on the market do not have a documented provenance."" 85-90 percent of artifacts on the market do not have documented provenance The contention that Western museums should identify and return such objects has only come up relatively recently, over the past 50 years, namely as European and American colonies in Africa and Asia have declared independence, developed their economies, and started to throw political weight around. ""Repatriation has become a hot topic in the last decade or so, with many third-world countries trying to assert their independence and cultural identity by demanding the return of their cultural objects that were stolen from them,"" Julia Fischer, a professor of art history at Georgia Southern University, wrote in an email to The Verge. ""In many cases, I believe these objects should be returned home."" ""I believe these objects should be returned home."" But it’s unclear how many objects in museums around the world should even be considered for repatriation, given that no clear criteria exist to make that determination. The UN has made some progress, establishing a 1970 convention designed to curb the export of stolen artifacts and allow countries to issue repatriation claims, then pay to have the objects returned. But many museums around the world have interpreted this convention to mean that if they can prove an object left its country of origin before 1970, they’re in the clear. Meanwhile, a UN report issued last year evaluating the effectiveness of the convention found it to have ""serious weaknesses,"" including a lack of staffing and few international laws to back it up. A UN committee established following the convention has presided over just six cases of successful restitutions in the past 40 years. But on the plus side, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and international law group Interpol maintain watch lists for artifacts reported stolen. ""Of course every museum director watches these things,"" Holzer said of the lists. Photo showing damage caused by looters to a temple in Cambodia. (Credit: UNESCO/C.Jacques.)   ""Wise and thoughtful judgement is necessary."" Outside of the UN and Interpol, several other efforts exist to cut down on the theft of artifacts and promote the return of stolen ones. The International Council of Museums (ICOM), a private organization representing 20,000 museums around the the globe, states in its ethics code for acquisitions that if a museum ""has reason to doubt"" the legality of an object, it should reach out to police and scholars to investigate the object’s country of origin. But ICOM’s leaders have also resisted the idea of a broad review of artifacts at member museums, saying in 2002: ""Repatriation of objects is an issue that should be very carefully dealt with. Wise and thoughtful judgement is necessary. Unnecessarily strong judgements or declarations should in any case be avoided."" Around the same time, ICOM also began advocating something of a partial fix, an idea it calls ""digital repatriation"" or ""virtual repatriation"" — scanning and uploading images of objects online, with the intent of allowing people in origin countries the opportunity to view them without museums having to send them back. But ICOM denies that this idea is meant to replace physical object returns. In 2007, the ICOM ethics committee chair said digital repatriation ""has never been proposed as a ‘soft option’ or easy alternative to physical repatriation."" a case-by-case basis  Among American museums, repatriation has mostly occurred on a ""case-by-case"" basis — typically when officials are confronted by foreign governments with solid evidence. The process often takes years, and it isn’t pleasant. The J. Paul Getty museum near Malibu, California, infamously agreed in 2007 to return upwards of 40 artifacts to Italy, including a large statue thought to be a likeness of the goddess Aphrodite that it purchased for $18 million in 1988. In recent years, museums across the country, from Brooklyn to Arizona, have all agreed to return objects to other countries or to native tribes within the US, in part motivated by a 1990 law requiring federally-funded institutes to identify and return Native American objects. The Met itself has repatriated dozens of objects over the past 20 years to countries including Rome, Egypt, and India, as the museum itself openly asserts, even sending The Verge press clippings of notable repatriations it has made going back to 1994. ""We returned items by making good decisions on our own,"" said Holzer. ""We have acted responsibly on a whole range of items. I can say that the Met never stops studying and researching the pieces in its collections."" Globe outside UNESCO headquarters in Paris, France. (Credit: UNESCO/Niamh Burke.)   ""Collecting reliable statistics is correspondingly hard."" But because so many museums in the US act of their own accord to return objects, there’s no sense of how many total objects have been returned so far. The Association of Art Museum Directors (AAMD), of which the Met and some 220 other museums are members, ""does not keep statistics on repatriation claims or returns,"" as a spokesperson told The Verge. Another US museum organization, the American Alliance of Museums (AAM), also doesn't maintain any cumulative list. ""The universe of US museums is vast and diverse, ranging from great institutions like the Met to the smallest college or community art galleries,"" said Erik Ledbetter, who led repatriation issues for AAM from 2003 to 2009. ""Collecting reliable statistics from such a vast and diverse field is correspondingly hard."" It’s also difficult to say just how many more repatriation claims will pop up in the future, as countries and tribes gain more political and economic clout. Even advocates of repatriation say the practice could go too far, leaving prestigious Western museums wiped out. ""I worry that with all the returns occurring lately that our museums will lack the diversity that is needed to understand world art in its entirety,"" Fischer said. ""There’s no purge."" The AAMD says it’s not worried about this possibility, because it only focuses on repatriation claims from 1971 onward. ""This does not open up all museum collections to claims,"" the organization’s spokesperson told The Verge. ""Rather, it focuses on a limited and specific collection of materials.""  Officials with the Met agree. ""We’re not trying to make any statements about the collection overall. There’s no purge, there’s no task force, no wholesale reexamination of things,"" Holzer said. Further, he argues that museums may actually help the process of returning artifacts to their home countries. ""If anybody has anything to say about [objects], they can come up front and tell us,"" Holzer said. ""If they are in the hands of private collectors or hoarders, nobody would know.""",0.5099100803013125,0.49008991969868754,0.8665585301057316,1474,5.2170963364993215,703,6.5903271692745378,0,0,"Culture, Policy & Law, Science, Report",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The tray is lined with something that looks like kitty litter, and there’s one small snake curled up into a neat tangle in the corner. One by one, the eggs are carefully sliced open as Jay — the man wielding the razor blade — exclaims in delight. ""Oh man!"" he says, ""What’s going on? I got a Tiger Anthrax, and he got a Tiger Anthrax. This is cray-"" He slices open the next egg, spilling out blood and yolk. ""Oh, no way,"" he shouts, hooking in a finger and pulling out a tiny baby snake that dazedly curls back on itself. ""It’s another Clown! Platinum!"" ""Like a kid opening up a Pokémon pack and constantly finding rares."" It’s clear that Jay gets very excited about snakes. Luckily for him, he’s parlayed his enthusiasm into a job. Jay Brewer — that's his full name — is the owner and founder of Prehistoric Pets, a reptilian superstore in southern California that specializes in morphs — custom-bred snakes with unusual pattern mutations and idiosyncratic names. I stumbled across the video of him opening a clutch of Clowns (a type of reticulated python) on Reddit, where one user described the video as, ""watching a kid open up a Pokémon or [Magic: The Gathering] booster pack … and constantly finding rares."" It’s a perfect comparison — Jay’s excitement is heart-warming — but there's also something weirder happening. On the one hand, we’ve got the genre of the unboxing video, where YouTube users open up newly purchased consumer goods (usually expensive clothes or electronics) for an audience that enjoys the comforting rustle of packaging and the second-hand feeling of ownership. And, on the other, there’s this unknown territory of baby snakes (are they even cute?) who aren’t unwrapped so much as they are liberated in this terribly organic mess of blood and yolk and egg shell. It's a hell of an unboxing.   ""I refuse to grow up,"" Jay tell us by phone. ""I’m 50 years old, and I’m doing what I love. [Snake breeding’s] been going on for about 28 years in the US, and I’ve been at it from the beginning. I pretty much got in on the bottom floor playing with it all, and it’s been amazing, amazing."" Each clutch played out on the end of increasingly delicate line of genetic code To Jay, a snake’s genetic code is a color chart with an index of odds attached. He finds the snakes he wants, breeds them together, and crosses his fingers that the right patterns will show up when he slices open the eggs. Sometimes the mutations he’s trying to create are more than a decade in the making; recessive genes for rare colors tracked down from generation to generation, each successive clutch of eggs played out on the end of an increasingly delicate line of genetic code. The Platinum Clowns that were hatched in the video at the top were the end result of at least eight generations of snakes, says Jay, combining genes from Platinum, Anthrax, and Super Tiger morphs — each of these the result of their own previous breeding programs. ""You dream about them,"" he says of his snakes, ""You dream about the sound, you dream about the color, and what it looks like, and then when you see that nose hanging out the egg and... Sometimes it’s like your dream, and sometimes it’s twice as good as what you wanted. When you’ve been waiting for five, eight, ten years and you get to see it! Oh boy, it’s quite a feeling.""   This type of specialized joy is something that plays well online, maybe because we feel privileged to see it. The sincere YouTube protagonist is one that gushes over double rainbows, heritage trains, and thundersnow, while we, the viewers, get that warm feeling of witnessing genuine happiness, safe in the knowledge that we will never have to care about this thing as much this person does. It's a pleasurable twofer and also an experience that must have been relatively hard to come by before the internet, before YouTube. With Jay’s videos, you get the vicarious delight — but you can also dive into his world, if you so choose. His channel’s been running for more than seven years and features hundreds of videos: here's Jay cutting open eggs; here he is showing off his snakes; here, shooting the shit with a rotating cast of breeders and fans. The other enthusiasts tend to appear without speaking roles, like fans pulled on-stage at a concert, though Jay’s team of breeders become slowly recognizable if you watch enough videos. (Tim, the head breeder and my favorite supporting character, has a mustache and says little. He does speak, though, like when he quietly lets Jay know that he’s moved within striking range of an angry python.) Most of the videos only have views in the low thousands and tens of thousands but a handful, like ""Ruby Eyes… Part 1,"" have crossed over the million views mark. The snakes sell for anything from a few hundred bucks to $20,000 Jay says he keeps around 1,200 reticulated pythons at his facility. He and his team mainly produce entirely new morphs, catering to the smaller-scale breeders which make up the the bulk of their customers. The store has sellers across the world including South Africa, Shanghai, and the UK, with ""base"" morphs selling for a couple of hundred bucks while more genetically complex specimens go for as much as $20,000. ""When we sell them we’re basically selling people a piece of life,"" says Jay. However, like any good breeder, Jay keeps the best and rarest specimens for himself, to breed even more exotic snakes. He claims that because of this his store is responsible for as many as 50 percent of new morphs made in the US. Other videos on Jay’s channel demonstrate this variety, with Jay pulling a succession of snake morphs out of storage, reeling off the names (Caramel Tiger, Sunfire Golden Child, Motley Super, Green Lantern, Platinum Titanium) like a man sorting a particularly exotic sock collection.  Jay's behavior towards the snakes looks a little impersonal in these videos, but it sounds like treating snakes any other way just doesn't make sense. Unlike traditional pets, snakes never bond with humans. Scientists say the main emotions they feel are fear and aggression. Unlike dogs, snakes aren’t social; unlike cats, they haven’t been domesticated. They are, in some sense, alien. What would you say the aspirations of a python are? They're also happier in spaces that might seem cramped. In the wild, snakes generally only head out into the open when they’re hunting. Even then, they're usually looking for some nook or cranny to leap out from. In a big, empty tank, the snake doesn’t have anywhere to hide — which can be stress-inducing. It may seem like a fairly dull and muted existence to hang out in a drawer all day, but then what exactly would you say the aspirations of a python actually are? Jay is perfectly happy with the snakes’ welfare. ""We don’t usually have much of the animal cruelty situation,"" he says. ""The only thing that people complain about is cutting the eggs, and I say look, in the wild the snakes sometimes die naturally in the egg, and I don’t want even one to die. It’s just a C-section in a way. Women — our wives, our daughters — go out and get C-sections, so what’s wrong with it?"" Jay stresses that he waits for the first snake in a clutch to cut its way out (baby snakes have a special ""tooth"" of pointed skin just for this moment) before opening up the rest of the clutch. He wields the razor carefully — so as not to nick the snake as he slices the shell. Although some of his videos do feel a little exploitative (especially those when he's just hauling big snakes out their cages to show them off), it’s obvious when he talks about this job that he cares for his animals deeply — even if they don’t feel the same way about him. Is youtube a record of civilization or countless little moments of intimacy? Recently, Alexis Madrigal of Fusion pointed out that YouTube’s greatest value may be as a record of modern civilization — a place where all those home movies and unwatched vlogs add up to something grand and important. This seems true, but also somehow incomplete; it misses the strange intimacy of many of these videos. Despite what people say about the web not being as wild as it used to be, it's still possible to aimlessly click around and stumble across a stranger who has recorded something that’s important to them — and also clearly bizarre. This is what makes ""Killer Clowns Multiplying"" so compelling. Think for a moment: How often do you get to meet someone with a deep interest in something you’ve never heard of? Maybe more frequently than you know — how often, after all, do people explain their strange passions? Videos like these are little shots of intimacy and passion and they're thrilling, they really are. Jay compares cutting open snake eggs to humans having C-sections because the two things really are similar to him, and we'd never have known, never have guessed walking by him on the street, if he hadn’t put his videos online where we can all watch them. We’re lucky to see this stuff.  ",0.6434298610390206,0.35657013896097944,0.14920588190431835,1608,4.7444029850746272,793,6.0315258511979826,0,6,"Culture, Web, Essay",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

In January, the company took the next step in its evolution and took its patents to trial for the first time. The case is against Motorola Mobility and by extension Google, which hasn't yet turned the company over to Lenovo; its phone displays, software update system, and other elements allegedly infringe on six of Intellectual Ventures’ thousands of patents. While the jury deliberates, the court of public opinion has largely made up its mind: Intellectual Ventures may insist that it’s helping inventors, but convincing anyone it’s not abusing the patent system will be an uphill battle, especially in an environment that’s never been more hostile. Intellectual Ventures describes itself as an ""invention marketplace"" — most simply, it buys up massive amounts of intellectual property and licenses it in bulk, serving as a kind of clearinghouse. Started by former Microsoft CTO Nathan Myhrvold in 2000 and initially funded by a who’s who of tech companies including Google, it touts a portfolio of 70,000 patent assets and $3 billion in licensing earnings, $500 million of which it says has been sent back to inventors. Every big name in tech, including Samsung, Apple, and Microsoft, has licensed patents from Intellectual Ventures, as have smaller startups like Nest. Almost a decade went by before Intellectual Ventures started serving lawsuits. The company’s stated goal is incubating new products by connecting inventors with people who want to turn their ideas into reality: four years ago, it started Intellectual Ventures Lab, a research sandbox that’s produced things like a better vaccine-storage system for developing countries and a mosquito-zapping laser for fighting malaria. Its patent collection was initially pitched as a defensive tool for companies facing lawsuits; IV co-founder and former Intel legal counsel Peter Detkin himself is credited with coining the term ""patent troll."" ""I hope never to file a patent lawsuit."" As the patent portfolio grew, though, the company began to look less like a shield and more like a threat. According to an influential paper by legal researchers Robin Feldman and Tom Ewing, it started snapping up intellectual property in earnest around 2004 or 2005, making hundreds of deals a year for patents and patent applications. In an environment where patents could be handy weapons, Intellectual Ventures was assembling a massive arsenal. Myhrvold, however, insisted that the company wasn’t looking for trouble. ""I've never filed a patent lawsuit. I hope never to file a patent lawsuit,"" he said in 2006, adding that they were a ""ridiculous way to do business."" By 2008, its $100-million licensing deals were being described by critics as tantamount to extortion, but the company had stayed out of court, even if it was accused of selling patents to litigious shell companies and, essentially, trolling by proxy. The threat became explicit on December 8th, 2010, when Intellectual Ventures filed complaints against nine companies in the software security, flash memory, and integrated circuit industries. McAfee, Symantec, and others were accused of infringing on four antivirus patents, and computer-hardware manufacturers were said to be doing the same with patents on various system-architecture processes. While all but a handful of those defendants, including Trend Micro and Symantec, have settled, Intellectual Ventures said it was involved in a total of 10 lawsuits as of 2012.  Patent lawsuits do not a troll make, but not only is Intellectual Ventures extremely powerful, tracking the path of any given patent it owns can be virtually impossible. Feldman and Ewing estimated that Intellectual Ventures had the fifth-largest collection of patents in the US, many hidden behind other names: the study identified 1,276 associated shell companies and believed more were still operating undetected. The central business claims no responsibility over many of these entities, obscuring how closely it's involved in any lawsuits they file. Where small trolls might fiercely litigate a handful of patents, it’s hard to tell where Intellectual Ventures’ influence ends. ""There was this idea — why don’t we take this troll idea and scale it?"" Ewing says now, though he's ambivalent about how well the simple ""troll"" label fits. ""And that’s exactly what IV did."" The company has two suits pending against Motorola, the first filed in October of 2011 as it was in the middle of an acquisition by Google. The complaint claimed that Motorola had refused good-faith offers to license six patents covering a detachable handset and docking system, software updates, display technology, file-transfer processes, and other elements of various feature phones and Android devices like the Photon 4G and Atrix Lapdock. Another suit, this one covering seven patents, followed in 2013. When one company that makes products sues another, the defendant usually gains leverage by using its own set of patents: Samsung, for example, responded to Apple’s lawsuit by going after the iPhone and iPad. But since Intellectual Ventures doesn’t make anything, Motorola can’t accuse it of infringing anyone else’s patents. Google has already suffered two legal defeats this year If Google and Motorola want to win this case, they’ll have to convince a jury either that they’re not infringing Intellectual Ventures’ patents, or that those patents are invalid. If Intellectual Ventures’ patent defines a software update tool in terms that don’t match Motorola’s system, or if the steps it describes are so obvious that anyone could think of them, IV loses. Deciding either of these things, though, involves a long and expensive process in which the court figures out what exactly the patents mean and how they can be applied. After a verdict, a court might decide damages, or the two parties may simply settle, with Motorola agreeing to pay a licensing fee. So far, Google hasn’t had great luck in 2014. Since the start of January, it’s suffered two legal defeats, one for push notifications and one for AdWords, at the hands of companies that can safely be described as patent trolls. Ewing believes that in this case, it may have taken a stand to put the larger Android ecosystem at ease. ""You pretty much would want to fight your battle here, because there's a lot at stake,"" he says. ""If I'm Google and suddenly this small Android manufacturer gets scared, that's not gonna go well for me."" Google is in the process of selling Motorola to Lenovo, but it’s still liable for anything Motorola did under its watch.  For a corporation like Google, Intellectual Ventures can be a powerful ally or a formidable enemy. But despite its reputation as the ""world’s largest patent troll,"" small businesses may be more threatened by the profession’s new, seedy underbelly. A cluster of shell companies made the news last year for going directly after small businesses that simply used the allegedly patented technology. Claiming they owned patents covering the obvious process of scanning a document and sending it to email, they tried to extract royalties for any employee who practiced it. Going to court isn't an optimal outcome for anyone, but unlike Intellectual Ventures, these trolls rely on targets simply not having the time or money to fight back.The bill that’s currently in Congress is largely aimed at stopping such small-time trolls from filing obviously frivolous claims, hoping that companies will pay up rather than go through a long and expensive lawsuit — in fact, Intellectual Ventures has expressed support for it. Intellectual Ventures itself has come out against the worst patent trolls EFF attorney Julie Samuels, who currently fills the Mark Cuban Chair to Eliminate Stupid Patents, says that unsympathetic, bottom-feeding trolls have also drawn attention to the offenses of companies like Intellectual Ventures. ""These cases had been going on for so many years: patent trolls going after large companies like the Motorolas, Googles, Apples of the world. And no one really cared,"" she says. ""What’s changed is that a lot of these trolls have started going after smaller actors: end users, small startups, individuals, app developers. And that’s why we’re at the place we’re at in DC now."" Patent reform has been an issue since the early days of Intellectual Ventures, but in 2014, it merited mention in the State of the Union address for the first time. ""If I were Intellectual Ventures, I would be really pissed off about companies like the scanner troll. Because what they've done is made an incredibly bad name for an industry that was largely left alone before."" Intellectual Ventures’ case might be high-profile, but another patent trial could have much bigger implications. This year, the Supreme Court is hearing a case that could broadly decide what constitutes a software patent — one lower-court judge warned that the ruling could be ""the death of hundreds of thousands of patents"" across the financial and software industries. Intellectual Ventures could potentially see some of its patents invalidated, but the overall legal repercussions will likely be narrow. Instead, Intellectual Ventures v. Motorola will be a trial with financial consequences for the people involved and symbolic consequences for the rest of us. In a year when Congress and the president are intent on cutting patent trolls off at the knees, it’s a concrete reminder of what’s at stake. Even so, the actual issue — whether Motorola’s designs are too close to the ones in the patents — isn’t what most people will be discussing. Outside the courtroom, the bigger questions are what power patents should hold in the first place, how easy it should be to get one, and whether the scales are tipped too far in favor of non-practicing entities like Intellectual Ventures. If Motorola and Google lose, they’ll have to pay up — but Intellectual Ventures won’t have convinced anyone that it’s in the right.",0.415830895456664,0.5841691045433359,0.18132630429008367,1619,5.2730080296479311,777,6.3577863577863578,0,0,"Policy & Law, US & World, Report",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

Microsoft, Google, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Yahoo have all reported the numbers for national security letters (NSLs) and requests made under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. The numbers given are far from exact. If companies want to split NSLs and FISA requests into separate categories, they can only reveal them in bands of 1,000; if they combine everything into one class, they can report them in bands of 250. LinkedIn and Apple, which published its report last week, chose the latter option: both said they had received between 0 and 249 total national security orders over the first half of 2013, requesting information about between 0 and 249 accounts. The other companies, all of which have much larger web presences and receive a higher volume of overall law enforcement requests, opted to split requests into separate categories with wider bands. The reports cover three categories: NSLs, FISA requests for metadata like account details, and FISA requests for actual content. No company listed getting more than 999 orders in six months for any one category, though some reports go back a lot further than others. Google has been tracking requests the longest, with data going back to 2009. Microsoft started in 2011, and Facebook began in 2012; Yahoo's report only goes back to the beginning of 2013.     When it comes to listing how many accounts the national security orders covered, the numbers give us a better sense of scale. In the first six months of 2013, for example, Microsoft received between 0 and 999 FISA orders requesting content from between 15,000 to 15,999 accounts. Facebook received between 0 and 999 requests for content from 5,000 to 5,999 accounts, Yahoo got orders covering 30,000 to 30,999 accounts, and Google had requests for 9,000 to 9,999 accounts. Requests for non-content information covered far fewer accounts, as did national security letters. The above companies filed suit against the US government last year, saying they had the right to publish information about national security requests in broad numbers. But they withdrew their complaints after striking this deal, although it doesn't go as far as any of the parties involved were hoping.

The trip had gone well. Shrem’s speech made the front page of the Dutch Financial Times, his Icelandair flight had internet, and he was excited to be reunited with his girlfriend, Courtney. He did not expect to be arrested when he got off the plane. But as soon as he saw the agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration and IRS waiting for him at the gate, he knew.   Whatever the trouble was, it must have something to do with Bitcoin.  Shrem had never been arrested before, but a magistrate detailed a list of felony charges against him the next morning: one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering, one count of failure to file a suspicious activity report, and one count of operating an unlicensed money transmitter, together carrying a maximum sentence of 25 years in prison. Bail was set at $1 million.   The glamorous life Shrem had been building for the past two years suddenly seemed poised to fall apart. Shrem is 5 feet 5 inches tall, full-bearded, and high-energy. He’s the kind of guy who likes to party and loves to organize events, but also goes to his parents’ house every Friday night for dinner. He started investing in Bitcoin as a senior at Brooklyn College, buying ""many thousands"" when the coins were around $3 or $4 each (they’re now over $800), but his notoriety didn’t come until BitInstant, the Bitcoin payments company he co-founded that was profitable almost from day one. The first glimmering of BitInstant came on June 13th, 2011, when a part-time student named Gareth Nelson posted his idea for a fast pay service on the forums at Bitcointalk.org. At the time, buying and selling Bitcoin on major exchanges like Mt Gox could take as long as six days, in part because many banks take days to process transfers. Nelson thought he could speed this up by fronting the balance, then collecting a small fee for the trouble, enabling customers to receive their bitcoins on the same day even if they were using cash. Because Bitcoin transactions are irreversible, there was basically no risk. All he needed was some startup capital. ""PM some more info,"" Shrem wrote back. ""I could work with you."" In those heady early days of the Bitcoin gold rush, legal compliance was most often an afterthought. ""Be careful and check with a good lawyer first,"" one Bitcoin user advised Nelson. ""You would probably be considered a money transmitter if you do this."" Nelson, who had some experience with virtual currency in a previous venture, brushed this off. ""What I've read up on the matter seems to suggest that I don't need a license,"" he wrote back. ""I'll look over the … rules again and seek proper legal advice on whether this may be an issue, but I truly believe it will not be."" Shrem rustled up $10,000 from his parents, which got the company off its feet in August of 2011. But the real cash came from angel investor Roger Ver, a staunch libertarian known as ""Bitcoin Jesus"" for the number of startups he’s seeded. Impressed by the new business model, Ver wired Shrem $125,000 after only a pair of detailed email exchanges and a 20 minute Skype call. BitInstant was soon processing millions of dollars' worth of transactions a month, struggling to keep pace with the skyrocketing demand for Bitcoin services. The sheer volume of traffic repeatedly brought the site down. Soon, transactions were backed up, causing rolling delays and even a class action lawsuit from customers who had caught the wrong side of a price shift. The site shut down, prepping a newer, faster back end, but by then it didn’t matter. Shrem had become a regular on the virtual currency speaking circuit, traveling to London and South America. He had moved out of his parents’ basement into an apartment in Midtown Manhattan and opened a showy bar on the ground floor called EVR. BusinessWeek named him one of the ""Bitcoin Millionaires."" A few days before Christmas, he put a deposit on a plane. ""There is no face of Bitcoin, but he was one of the the big faces of Bitcoin,"" says Marc Hochstein, executive editor of American Banker, who met Shrem through the New York Bitcoin community. ""He was such a charming guy. He was really amiable, he had this beautiful girlfriend. He was this plucky, short Jewish guy from Brooklyn who had computer skills and decided to start his own company, and he was living the Entourage life. I envied the kid up until a few days ago."" The case basically comes down to fewer than a dozen emails between Shrem and a customer calling himself ""BTCKing,"" who was buying bitcoins on BitInstant using large amounts of cash. BTCKing was a reseller, someone who bought bitcoins and resold them at a markup. His customers, however, were users of the infamous Silk Road, the underground Bitcoin-only marketplace where people bought and sold illegal drugs. According to the complaint, on January 17th, 2012,  BTCKing tried to deposit $4,000 in cash on BitInstant in a single day. By then, awareness of money transmitter laws was growing within the Bitcoin community and a new attitude of caution was taking hold. BitInstant was registered as a money transmitter with the federal government, which meant anything over $3,000 had to be reported. In addition, BitInstant officially refused deposits over $1,000, although it occasionally broke this rule. BTCKing had pushed the limit before, and BitInstant’s cash-processing company TrustCash had doubts. Shrem went nuclear, cc’ing the TrustCash CEO on a fire-breathing email banning BTCKing from the service permanently. ""We have all your deposits on record, your picture from bank security cameras,"" Shrem wrote. ""Any attempt at a new transfer will result in criminal prosecution."" By the end, BTCKing was begging just to get his money back. But BTCKing was a whale, doing thousands of dollars in transactions a week. For a small exchange like BitInstant, it was hard to let that business go. After the kerfuffle died down, Shrem messaged him privately with a much softer tone. ""No problem, in the future please have your customers respect our $1,000 limit,"" he wrote, according to court documents. ""Your email address is banned, but you can use a different one."" According to an IRS investigation, the man behind BTCKing was Robert Faiella, a 52-year-old Florida man. Faiella never registered with any financial authorities, of course. Faiella knew he would face jail time if the authorities ever found out what he was up to, according to conversations he allegedly had with the former Silk Road operator, the pseudonymous Dread Pirate Roberts. But by all indications, Shrem didn’t take the law seriously. While his co-founder Nelson had reversed his earlier bluster and become very careful about money-laundering laws, Shrem was cavalier. ""He has not broken a law and Silk Road itself is not illegal,"" Shrem said in one email to his co-founder cited in the complaint. ""We also don't have any rules against resellers. We make good profit from him."" Right, Nelson replied, but ""so many of his transactions smell like fraud or money laundering."" ""Cool,"" came the one-word reply. The criminal complaint alleges that Shrem himself had bought drugs on Silk Road, which squares with the pothead lifestyle he boasted about to reporters. ""I won’t hire you unless I’ve either had a drink with you or smoked weed with you. That’s just my rule,"" he told both The New York Observer and Vocativ. In February of 2012, he messaged a Verge reporter, excited about receiving a package. ""Wow, Silk Road actually works,"" he wrote. ""Just got my batch of brownies."" (While Silk Road did sell non-drugged food items, it was implied that the brownies were laced with pot.) The companies kept growing, Shrem’s and Faiella’s in parallel, according to the investigation. Soon Faiella was doing $20,000, $30,000, $40,000 in a single week. Shrem reassured him, ""I always take care of you, we even know which orders are yours."" As Faiella brought in more and more money, Shrem started offering him discounts. By October of 2012, Faiella had bought more than $1 million worth of Bitcoin through BitInstant. That same month, TrustCash decided it had had enough and broke off its business with Shrem, leaving BitInstant unable to process cash deposits. When TrustCash left, so did Faiella. He started taking cash on his own, telling clients to deposit money directly into his bank account. That was the last Shrem heard of BTCKing until the day of his arrest. While Shrem was being arraigned in New York, Faiella was being indicted in Florida. For the first wave of users, buying Bitcoin felt like a game you played with an elite group of people who knew something everyone else didn’t. It was an incredibly complex world that grew more sophisticated by the week, but it felt protected and separate from reality, to say nothing of the world of regular finance. But that’s no longer true: Bitcoin’s part of the system now. Any money transmitter, from Western Union on down, is required to register with the US Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) and install compliance officers whose sole purpose is to sniff out money launderers. BitInstant is no exception. Shrem registered as a chief compliance officer in March of 2012, obligating him to report potentially illegal activity back to the government. The US attorney says he was negligent in those duties, but the larger issue of BitInstant’s independence was already settled: in the libertarian battle between the state and free enterprise, money exchanges are already occupied territory. The actual penalties are less clear. Michael Bachner, a New York attorney who specializes in white-collar crime, says it’s very unlikely that Shrem will serve 25 years. If he cooperates with the police and assists with the case against Faiella, he could even walk without doing time — it all depends on the judge. Some members of the Bitcoin community believe that the prosecutor’s aggressiveness stems from the government’s animosity toward the virtual currency, but Bachner says it’s just the fact that the case involves drugs. ""If he was laundering the proceeds of a tax scheme or a securities scheme or some other white-collar offense, it would be not nearly as serious as a narcotics offense,"" he says. Already, the trial could have repercussions far beyond just BitInstant and Charlie Shrem. The same week as Shrem’s arrest, the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) held a two-day hearing as the first step in creating a new regulatory category for Bitcoin transmitters. The stakes are high: the government is still asserting its jurisdiction over the decentralized, peer-to-peer network it could quite possibly destroy. Naturally, the rest of the Bitcoin community is taking pains to appear as law-abiding as possible. Other Bitcoin companies have been quick to distance themselves from anything to do with money laundering. ""I think Charlie Shrem was respected by a lot of people,"" says Jeremy Allaire, CEO of the gestating payments facilitator Circle. ""It just underscores that if you’re building a company in this space, you need to take the Bank Secrecy Act and money-transmitter laws very seriously."" BitInstant’s former competitor Coinbase issued a similar statement: ""While we cannot comment directly on this case given the investigation surrounding it is still underway, it is to the benefit of the Bitcoin community to root out any bad actors, and we applaud law enforcement’s action in this regard."" The Winklevoss twins of Facebook fame, who gave Shrem $1.5 million in investment, quickly sided with the government, saying they were ""obviously deeply concerned."" The Bitcoin Foundation, the trade group that serves as the closest thing to an official voice of the Bitcoin movement, quickly announced that Shrem had resigned as vice chairman. Noting that while he was innocent until proven guilty, the foundation felt compelled to clarify that it ""does not condone illegal activities."" That doesn’t sit well with many hard-line Bitcoin partisans, many of whom identify as voluntarist or, in simpler terms, libertarian. Roger Ver says he doesn’t believe any crime has taken place, even if it’s wise to abide by money-laundering regulations for practical reasons. ""Money laundering is not a crime,"" Ver says. ""It's just because certain men with guns don't like what other people are doing with their own money, so they decide it's okay to lock those people in a cage. Even if absolutely everything the government is alleging is true, Charlie has done nothing that's morally wrong."" In the meantime, Charlie Shrem has no shortage of friends. He was released on house arrest after his parents put up their house as collateral. He’s started asking for donations for his legal defense in Bitcoin, and many of his past associates—- even one who felt burned after a business deal gone bad — have jumped to his defense. Hochstein recalls how Shrem was the one who told him the meaning of ""FUD,"" the acronym for ""fear, uncertainty, and doubt."" He recalled the scrappiness of BitInstant, which had an office in the Flatiron district of Manhattan where Bitcoin users would gather. ""It was very much a startup in the classic sense, which I just thought was very cute, and I don’t mean that in a condescending way,"" he says. ""But it was starting to collide with the reality of the regulations that we live under. It’s just sort of cruel the way they will make an example and throw the book at a guy who, as far as I can tell, was maybe just a little mischievous and a little cocky.""

With Vladimir Putin's full support and Russia's national pride on the line, these games are almost as important to the host nation as they are to the athletes competing in them. According to The Wall Street Journal, a report investigating the US speedskating team's lackluster performance at the Winter Olympics has identified the late introduction of Under Armour's racing suit as ""a factor"" in the debacle. The report also points to the team's pre-Olympic travel schedule, poorly planned practice locations, and the skate sharpening system used during Sochi as other problems. With a history of medal wins, the United States entered Sochi as an immediate favorite in... The Winter Olympics are over, but the massive stadiums, hotels, and roadways that were built for the event aren't going anywhere. And if history is any indicator that could be a major problem for host city Sochi. Russia spent a record $51 billion preparing Sochi to host the games, transforming the seaside resort city into a winter wonderland in one of the most ambitious overhauls in Olympic history. Authorities have said they hope the investment will turn the region into a major tourist... The Winter Games drew to a close Sunday night in Sochi, as host country Russia extinguished the Olympic flame and passed the torch to South Korea. At one point during the closing ceremony, a group of dancers began forming the five Olympic rings, expanding outwards like the mechanical display that famously malfunctioned during the opening ceremony. Once again, the fifth ring remained closed for a nervous few seconds, before finally expanding to complete the formation. It was a well-executed... The enormous scale of Russia's Olympic security apparatus has been well documented — 40,000 armed forces, 11,000 closed circuit cameras, and an all-powerful electronic surveillance system, all designed to prevent terrorist attacks and domestic unrest at the Winter Games. So far, though, the forces making headlines out of Sochi aren't armed policemen or military guards, but Cossacks: a group of deeply traditional militiamen who are seen as both Olympic mascots and vigilante crusaders,... News networks went wild when US Olympic luger Kate Hansen posted a video of what appeared to be a wolf walking around her Sochi hotel Wednesday night, but it turns out that the video is actually yet another elaborate prank by none other than Jimmy Kimmel. On his show last night, Kimmel revealed that his team found a wolf, built a replica of Hansen's hotel hallway, and posted it to her YouTube and Twitter accounts with her permission. Naturally, Hansen's attachment to the video made it quite... The ongoing Winter Olympics in Sochi may be the last time you see figure skating in its traditional form. From next season, the singles and pairs programs will allow the use of music backed by vocals, thanks to new rules agreed on by the International Skating Union. Although lyrical music is already commonplace in the ice dancing discipline, which requires couples to skate to a backing track with a beat, most singles and pairs contestants opt for classical accompaniment. The New York Times... The Olympic Games have strict rules when it comes to advertising, which is why you don't see athletes covered in brand names, NASCAR-style. But some athletes have discovered a loophole — and it's on the bottom of their snowboards. As the New York Times reports, at Sochi 2014 many snowboarders are displaying huge, colorful manufacturer logos on the bottom of their boards, logos which are front and center when the athletes perform high-flying tricks. Though their hardware is a bit smaller,... An alpha female displays her dominance over the herd (BBC / LiveLeak).

The Jamaican bobsled team hasn't shied away from having fun on its route to the Sochi Winter Olympics — the team turned to PayPal and crowdfunding to get the money it needed to return (and got a boost from the oft-charitable Dogecoin foundation).

The US speedskating team has asked Olympic officials in Sochi for permission to abandon the Under Armour suits that may be contributing to underwhelming results on the ice. The Wall Street Journal reports that US team representatives made the request earlier today, though there's no guarantee that a switch will be made — even if they get the OK. Apparently the Under Armour controversy has caused something of a division on the team; roughly half of the skaters want to revert back to full-body... Whether it's swimming, running, or skating, full-body racing suits have consistently courted controversy — either because they're perceived as giving an unfair advantage or, as has been the case with this year's US speedskating team, because they actually slow the wearer down.

It was developed in partnership... A prominent Russian environmentalist and outspoken critic of the Winter Olympic Games in Sochi was sentenced to three years in a prison colony this week, sparking outrage from human rights activists. As the New York Times reports, an appeals court in the city of Krasnodar handed down the sentence on Wednesday, upholding a ruling from a lower court in December. The activist, Yevgeny Vitishko, has been ordered to serve time in a penal colony for violating the terms of a suspended sentence...

The Olympic Village in Sochi, Russia, on the shores of the Black Sea. ( Wikipedia) Sochi is not the most obvious place to host the Winter Olympics. The Russian resort, on the eastern shore of the Black Sea, is humid and subtropical. Temperatures average out at about 52 degrees Fahrenheit in the winter, and 75 degrees in the summer. Palm trees line the streets, and it's the only part of Russia warm enough to grow tea leaves. In other words, it's a lovely spot if you're planning a beach... The upcoming Winter Olympics in Sochi are set to be the most lavishly expensive that the world's ever seen, but you wouldn't know it by looking at the logo.

In just a couple of weeks, the 2014 Winter Olympics will commence at the Black Sea resort of Sochi on Russia's southwestern border. At that point, an estimated $51 billion will have been spent on preparing the city and its surrounding area for the influx of athletes, spectators, and ongoing tourism that is expected to follow. Such grandeur of spending and development, argues The New York Times, hasn't been seen in Russia since the pre-Gorbachev days of the Soviet Union, and the catalyst... Jamaica's cash-strapped bobsled team should be able to make it to the Olympics this year thanks to some unlikely donors. At the head of the pack is Reddit's community of Dogecoin enthusiasts, who have collected over $30,000 worth of their virtual currency and are currently in the process of transferring it into liquid, stable cash that can be sent over to the team.  Jamaica has a bobsled team, and it's getting ready to return to the Winter Olympics. Jamaica's team qualified for the winter games for the first time in over a decade this weekend, but it's going to take quite a bit more than skill to get them over to Sochi for the 2014 Games.

But only still photos will be allowed, according to Adams — journalists will be banned from posting video due to restrictions on broadcasting...

Google has agreed a deal with the National Football League to show highlights on YouTube, creating an official NFL channel on the video site a month after it signed off on a similar deal with Facebook. The deal won't allow YouTube to show entire games, but the NFL says it will give Google clips of ""in-game"" footage. Highlights from next week's Super Bowl, between the Seattle Seahawks and the New England Patriots, will be the first official videos to appear on the site. In addition, Google has expanded its NFL-related search results, offering extensive information about a team's scores, background, and upcoming games in its ""OneBox"" search result format. Google search results will now show extensive information about specific teams Google agreed a similar deal with ESPN last year for the soccer World Cup, offering detailed information on scores and games when people searched for tournament teams. In that case, clips weren't made available on YouTube — Google pointed users towards ESPN's own video player. This time around, a mockup of Google's new NFL search results on a smartphone shows an embedded YouTube highlight video. As a part of the deal, Google has reportedly agreed to share money earned on ads it sells against YouTube videos and expanded search results with the league, while also agreeing to promote the NFL on YouTube and elsewhere.   The NFL is still pushing people to watch its games on the TV networks that have shelled out millions of dollars for the rights to air them, but after years of fiercely protecting its video content, this move is the latest of a series of cautious steps into the digital world. NBC is streaming the Super Bowl on February 1st, and a year before it agreed terms with Facebook to allow official video and fantasy football content on the social network, the NFL made a deal with Twitter to show highlights on the service.

Its scope is more concentrated than that: a chronicle of a five-day interview between David Foster Wallace and reporter David Lipsky, on the final stop of his book tour for Infinite Jest. (Along with Selma, it makes one hopeful for a new, more considered class of biopic, in which the screenwriter doesn't feel the need to tell their subject's life story in order to relay what was remarkable about him or her.) I left The End of the Tour feeling twin convictions far stronger than I usually have as the credits roll on a film. One: as Wallace, Jason Segel is really wonderful; sensitive and subtle, a pleasant surprise after the somewhat wince-inducing paparazzi photos of him on set in full bandana-and-wire-rim cosplay regalia that made the internet rounds last year. Two: I want to strangle Jesse Eisenberg. Or David Lipsky. Or Jesse Eisenberg's portrayal of David Lipsky. The layers of adaptation and subjectivity make this conveniently murky, so if you're reading this, guys, bear in mind: I'm talking about a movie. A narrative movie based on book based on a would-be magazine story. Don't take it too personally. Unless I'm right. The fundamentally unnatural human interaction that is the profile interview Eisenberg plays Lipsky, a then-Rolling Stone reporter who would go on to write Although Of Course You End Up Becoming Yourself: A Road Trip With David Foster Wallace, an account of the interview he conducted in 1998 for a never-published profile of Wallace. The film is more or less an adaptation of that book. But moreso than a portrait of Wallace, The End of the Tour ends up being an investigation of the fundamentally unnatural human interaction that is the profile interview. The film, which is almost entirely a dialogue between Segel's Wallace and Eisenberg's Lipsky, paints the interview — because that's what it was and never ceased to be, no matter how intimate and charged their conversation becomes — as a kind of foreign invasion. And like any occupying force, Lipsky arrives with a set of preconceived notions about his host and how best to take advantage of him. In the post-film Q&A Pondsoldt spoke highly of Lipsky's book (which I have not read) and Lipsky himself, so I am led to believe that the overwhelming loathing I felt for Eisenberg's portrayal of the author was not intentional. That does not make the film any less of an accomplishment, or any less thought-provoking. And of course, many of Lipsky's flaws and insecurities are vital to the storyline; we meet him at the underpopulated reading for his first book and it is writ large that he takes on the Wallace profile with his struggling writer baggage fully in tow. But I suspect we're also supposed to identify with him to a degree, if as nothing else than as a DFW fanboy. By the time he returns to New York from the snowy anonymity of Bloomington, Illinois one doesn't get the sense that he would have conducted himself any differently during his time with Wallace. In a way, he has reconciled his feelings of insufficiency in the towering shadow of Wallace by making his five days with him a part of his own identity. A kind of literary Talented Mr. Ripley Viewed this way (which, again, I am not sure was Ponsoldt's intention, or the critical consensus here at Sundance,) The End of the Tour then plays out like a kind of literary The Talented Mr. Ripley. And in the face of Lipsky's insatiability, the Segel can't help but portray Wallace as constantly on the defensive, protecting nothing less than his own interiority. This, perhaps in combination with the nature of the source material, paints an even more saintly, beleaguered picture of Wallace than a conventional Oscar-bait biopic would. The film is bookended by flash forwards after Wallace's death by suicide in 2008: we see Lipsky eulogize Wallace on NPR and at a (much better attended) reading of Although Of Course..., and these are his final acts of consumption and assumption of his subject. After his death, Lipsky becomes the foremost authority on Wallace, which is almost as good as being Wallace. Lipsky becomes the foremost authority on Wallace, which is almost as good as being Wallace    But as if to underscore the folly of this, Ponsoldt pairs the reading from Lipsky's book with a gauzy, ecstatic final image of Wallace dancing at the Baptist church — the dance he had told Lipsky he'd be headed after they parted ways; a moment Lipsky was not there for, armed with his ever-present with tape recorder and notepad. It's a reminder that a personality can never be fully captured in five days, or one film; certainly not one as huge as Wallace's. It's hopeful — that perhaps David Foster Wallace found some moments to be just Dave, away from interviewers and sycophants, even before his tragic death. We know this story doesn't have a happy ending, but it's some comfort to think that there were moments of peace somewhere in the middle.",0.8711823595237289,0.1288176404762711,0.15044736866272615,880,4.8284090909090907,436,6.1077981651376145,0,0,"Culture, Entertainment, Film, Movie Review",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Sundance Hype is like a game of telephone. We all arrive knowing nothing, but in an environment full of self-described insiders and reporters and Park City moms and other types of know-it-alls, having information becomes Goal #1 as soon as we hit main street. So you hear something — you read a tweet, you overhear a conversation on the shuttle — and the next time you find yourself making small talk in line or at a party and someone brings up a film you can say ""Oh, that's supposed to be amazing."" With any luck, it is amazing, and the game of telephone helped motivate you to get on the waitlist for something you otherwise would have missed. But a lot of times you are met with disappointment. And then, unlike a game of telephone, you never get a chance to look around at everyone and laugh about how garbled the message got, because most people are still obediently repeating it even as they leave the theater.  THE FESTIVAL IS ITS OWN CONTEXTUAL MICROUNIVERSE It's kind of alienating, to be totally honest. In my first diary entry I expressed my excitement about seeing things free of context, but — surprise, surprise — the festival itself is its own contextual microuniverse, with its own buzz currency (if you're reading tweets from the festival and feeling that FOMO, trust me, everyone here on the ground feels it too). I've seen seven films here so far and none so far has given me that ""Ah! How I love the cinema!"" feeling. (Moments in Girlhood, a Spotlight film which premiered at Cannes last year, did, but the film as a whole never really gelled as a fully cohesive organism.) But when I peruse reviews and tweets coming from the festival, I feel like I must be missing something. I'll give you the rundown of the last couple days. Friday was a disaster, and I apologize to anyone who was subject to my stream of tweets as I sat alone at Bandits Bar and Grill eating a BBQ chicken salad and charging my phone. (Especially Skrillex. Sorry I didn't make it to your show, the flock of girls outside the venue wearing sleeveless dresses and stilettos in 20 degree weather made me tired just looking at them.) After seeing a midday press screening of Girlhood, I proceeded to miss waitlists for Tangerine and The D Train, which left me wandering up and down Main Street. It was pretty cold that evening, and there's something incredibly demoralizing about searching for a café or bookstore or something where you can sit down and warm up and realizing that every single storefront is guarded by a PA with an iPad that your name is not on. I finally finagled my way into a party for The Overnight, a film I still have not seen (but which is supposed to be amazing) and drank free wine ten feet from Jason Schwartzman, so it was a productive hour, in that I'd finally have something to text my mom about. I woke up on Saturday determined to do better. I set my alarm for 6:30, sent some perturbed emails to the ticketing office (an email account that I'm pretty sure reroutes to the black hole in Interstellar), did some planking exercises, then joined the waitlist for The End of the Tour at 7AM on the dot and grabbed spot number six. I showed up at the Eccles absurdly early, was first in line there, and with God as my witness, I saw that David Foster Wallace movie. I was fully in command of my experience and feeling great. CHARMING, ICKY, AND STRESSFUL, JUST LIKE SAN FRANCISCO The Diary of a Teenage Girl was next. I've heavily tipped my priorities toward female filmmakers and female driven stories this year, and you have no idea how much my ambivalence toward many of them is bugging me? Diary has its charming moments, but it is also icky and stressful, much how I imagine the 1976 San Francisco in which it is set really was. It's also a little bit of an inside job; writer/director Marielle Heller is a Sundance lab alum, and aside from its provocative premise (its 15-year old heroine, played by newcomer Bel Powley, is having an affair with Alex Skarsgard) it plays out pretty true to the Sundance film template. Powley's breakout is one of the primary narratives being pushed this year; someone somewhere has decided that she will be the Next Jennifer Lawrence, thus making this year's festival, and the Sundance star system in general, a success. Film no. 3 was Noah Baumbach's Mistress America, the biggest disappointment of the festival for me thus far. Man, oh man, how I wanted to like this one — Frances Ha was one of my favorite films of 2013, and I am one of those people who just falls for anything Greta Gerwig does hook, line, and sinker. Gerwig plays Brooke, a flighty would-be renaissance woman who takes college freshman Tracey (Lola Kirke) under her wing upon her arrival in New York City. Mistress America is almost about many things — what it means to be young, what it means to be successful, what it means to write fiction — but much like Brooke, never really commits to any of them. And the neo-screwball vibe it's going for is an awkwardly fitting put-on for Baumbach: his rapid-fire, stagey direction left me frequently distracted, imagining what the lines looked like in screenplay format, which is never a good thing. WANTING SO BADLY TO SEE SOMETHING GREAT THAT YOU BELIEVE YOU HAVE IN FACT SEEN SOMETHING GREAT Are you keeping count? That's three movies in a day. I was crushing it. My final film of the day was The Amina Profile, a documentary that can more or less be summed up as ""Catfish meets The Arab Spring."" This is one of those festival films that is incredibly frustrating to write about: it has at least one truly surprising turn that should not be spoiled, but unlike the splashier, celebrity-starring or -backed films, it's not a given that it will get any play beyond the festival circuit. Suffice to say it is a truly weird story about social that takes place in the middle of what is considered the first social media revolutionary movement.  I want to champion The Amina Profile despite its somewhat repetitive, laggy editing, because it's small and unexpected and the kind of film I came here wanting to see. And after a couple days here, you want to see something great so badly that you begin to believe that you have in fact seen something great.

The company has pulled back the curtain on Oculus Story Studio, an internal team focused on exploring the potential of what it calls ""VR cinema"" — and the group's first movie is debuting this week. Called Lost, the project is a real-time computer generated VR experience for the Crescent Bay prototype, and is directed by Saschka Unseld, a former Pixar animator who created the 2013 short The Blue Umbrella. Lost runs roughly five minutes in length, but in what Unseld touts as one of the project’s innovations, it changes the pace of its storytelling based on the action taken by the viewer. ""It could be three-and-a-half minutes and it could be 10,"" he says. ""It all depends on you."" ""We knew how to get started with games, but we didn't know how to get started with film."" The Story Studio initiative started because Oculus was showing off the Rift to Hollywood filmmakers who got excited about the potential of VR and wanted to make something — but the company didn’t know how to move forward. ""We didn’t have an answer for them,"" says Oculus CEO Brendan Iribe. ""We knew how to get started with games, but we didn’t know how to get started with film, with Hollywood, with cinema."" With interactive storytelling holding obvious potential for VR, and other projects already making it out into the marketplace, Oculus wanted to get out ahead by tackling not just the logistical questions around creating VR narrative experiences, but the conceptual ones as well. ""How do you create content? What’s the tools, the pipeline? Is it even possible to make a cinema experience that is compelling and rich?"" Iribe asks. ""One of the goals of the Story Studio team was to prove that.""  Lost concept art For Unseld, joining the project was a matter of getting in on the ground floor of what he sees as a true turning point in media and entertainment. ""We all heard these stories of how it was like to be there at the birth of computer animation, or see films on how it was to be there at the birth of cinema,"" he says. ""And when I tried out VR the first time, and everyone here, they realized this is that moment. This is the moment of a birth of a completely new medium. … That made me just instantly jump on it."" The challenges the he and his team have been exploring are the same ones that artists like Chris Milk, Felix & Paul, and other VR creators have been tackling with their own projects: namely, how do VR experiences differ from traditional movies and games, and what can they do differently? Film is a ""dictatorship of the director"" ""Initially we thought we needed to figure out how film language works in VR,"" explains Unseld, but trying to reproduce the conventions of movies was missing the point entirely. ""Cinema is a sequential medium,"" he says. ""It’s like a dictatorship of the director. Look at this, look at this face, look at this detail."" VR, on the other hand, puts control back in the hands of the viewer, fundamentally changing the concept of storytelling itself. The Oculus story team is small, currently just around 10 people. Iribe and Unseld say the goal is to stay nimble so they can shift as the medium evolves creatively in the months ahead. And while Oculus-produced projects are certainly notable in their own right — and yes, more are on the way — by introducing Lost at Sundance the company hopes to do the same thing the festival's New Frontier program is doing: inspiring new artists by showing them work on the bleeding edge. ""Look at how we did it all, and look at how Saschka and the team put this together,"" says Iribe. ""The more we can educate the community, the faster the community can get started and be successful."" And with a games publishing arm already in place, Oculus is well positioned to help filmmakers distribute their VR projects if that community gets going. The fact that the company behind the Rift is putting out its own VR movie certainly has the potential to lead new creators in a certain direction, but Unseld stresses that his team doesn’t believe that there’s one true VR movie experience to rule them all. ""Often when I talk to people about VR storytelling it takes a while for everyone to understand there’s lots of parallel tracks,"" he says. ""There’s things that can be more interactive, things that are less interactive. There’s things that are more exploratory, there’s things that are more linear."" VR cinema is a medium, he says, not a single type of experience. VR cinema is a medium, not a single type of experience Sundance attendees will be able to sign up to see Lost for themselves throughout the week, and while the company obviously feels confident enough in the project to show it to the general public, Iribe cautions that it is still early days for Story Studio.

A friend stood in the doorway of my college dorm room, face slack, and said two words: ""Kurt died."" And over the ensuing days and months the machinery of pop culture churned, desperately trying to put his death into some sort of relatable context. With Cobain in particular, the pieces were already in place for instant deification. A child of divorce, known for being empathetic to a fault, reluctantly drawn into a world of fame he never wanted and driven to drug abuse by a stomach ailment that only heroin could cure. It was a tragic narrative, but comforting in its familiarity, and passing murder conspiracy theories aside we’ve pretty much stuck with it for the last 20 years. Brett Morgen’s arresting Sundance documentary Kurt Cobain: Montage of Heck changes that. Pulling from a treasure trove of unreleased audio, video, photos, and journal entries, it’s a whirlwind trip through the life and mind of the musician that holds nothing back. It’s loud. It’s aggressive. And it will make you hate Cobain at times. A stylistic mash-up of archival footage, interviews, and animated sequences ""My movies tend to try to become an embodiment of the subject,"" Morgen said in a post screening Q&A, and to achieve that goal the filmmaker uses a stylistic mash-up of archival footage, interviews, and extended animation sequences. In home movies, a young Cobain — cherubic and smiling at his first birthday parties — transforms into a sullen, disconnected teen as his parents divorce and he’s shuttled from family member to family member. Donald Cobain, sharing the same shocking light eyes as his son, grips the arm of a sofa as he struggles to talk about him, demonstrating in a single moment the meager emotional support he must have provided Kurt during childhood. Morgen takes the audience further by using audio recordings from Cobain — in one sequence, Cobain recounts what appears to be a teenaged suicide attempt on a set of railroad tracks — and brings them to life as animated sequences. It lends the movie a trippy intimacy, but the film really leans into the surreal when it comes to Cobain’s journals and artwork. With Courtney Love and Cobain’s daughter Frances Bean both supporting the project, Morgen had access to the musician’s entire archive of material, and the film turns his paintings, drawings, and scribblings into full-motion kinetic sequences that serve as a direct line into Cobain’s own sense of self. If you’re familiar with his work at all, there’s something undeniably visceral about seeing the cover of Incesticide come to life, or the familiar scrawl of Cobain’s handwriting pouring out onto the page.   But despite the audio-visual invention of those sequences, the first half of Montage of Heck remains quite conventional in covering the well-trod ground we’re already familiar with. It even takes the mythologizing a step further, presenting the completion of Nirvana’s breakout record Nevermind as an operatic tragedy, complete with choral backing and the idea the Cobain’s mother Wendy O’Connor preternaturally saw the downfall that was to come. Kurt and Courtney fawn over each other in domestic junkie bliss That’s when the film shifts, however, giving us another side of Cobain entirely. Montage of Heck delves unflinchingly into Cobain’s relationship with Courtney Love — and with heroin. Home video footage shows the couple hanging around their grungy home, naked and kissing, wrapped up in domestic junkie bliss. According to Morgen, Love simply handed over the keys to a storage facility full of Cobain-related material and let him use whatever he found without interference, and it shows in the intensely intimate nature of the footage. It’s awkward and uncomfortable to watch at times, particularly as Cobain continues to spiral even after the birth of his daughter, but it’s not all morbid. There’s a love and tenderness between the two, and Cobain is so charismatic that watching him talk shit about Soundgarden and Guns N’ Roses to his wife is undeniably hilarious. But it also reveals an astounding amount of self-consciousness and insecurity, a point that the film drives home again and again: despite his enormous talent, Cobain was a thin-skinned man who was incapable of taking criticism or critique of any sort. Despite his talent, Cobain was incapable of taking criticism or critique If I’m totally honest, I had a hard time buying Cobain’s reluctant rock star pose back in the day. His will-he, won’t-he relationship with stardom seemed confused at best; showing up on the cover of Rolling Stone with a handmade t-shirt reading ""Corporate magazines still suck"" is a great gag, but you’re still on the cover of Rolling Stone. And despite the protestations about stardom, Cobain was clearly driven to be as good as he could be: Montage of Heck shows off some early journal entries where he broke down the budget for his band and sets forth the kind of rehearsal schedule they’ll need to succeed. He was both the rock star and the sensitive recluse What Morgen’s movie makes clear is that he was actually both those things: the driven artist who enjoyed playing to massive crowds, and the one who hid away and distanced himself to avoid hurtful negative feedback. Like all of us, a person in constant conflict with certain aspects of himself — and so in denial that he refused to acknowledge he was high even while nodding off in the middle of his daughter getting a haircut. (That last scene hasn’t left my mind since I saw the movie; it’s harrowing and horrible, and letting it be shown is an act of bravery on both Love and Frances Bean Cobain’s part.) ""We really felt we wanted the film to be raw,"" Morgen said after the screening. ""We wanted it to be unflinching, and we didn’t want to make Kurt into a saint. But this film is made with a tremendous amount of love."" Morgen’s strange, wonderful, audio-visual assault accomplishes all of that, and it does something much harder than the usual routine of taking a dead rock star and making them mythic. Instead it takes an icon, and makes him all too human.

Xiaomi unveiled the Mi 4i in New Delhi on Thursday, the first major product announcement that the Chinese company has made outside its home country. Picking the Indian capital as the venue for an important milestone in the five-year-old company's journey was no accident. Barely three quarters after it first entered India, Xiaomi has established itself as the fifth-biggest smartphone vendor in the country, making India its biggest overseas market in the process. What makes this feat impressive is the fact that Xiaomi managed to do this despite the fact that, until recently, its phones were only available online — this, in a country where less than 20 percent of the population has internet access. In India, offline sales channels still dominate the market. However, setting up an offline sales network in India can be tricky. Unlike the US, where you need to make sure a handful of major retailers stock your products and you are pretty much covered, in India the majority of retail is still unorganized. There are middlemen that help simplify things by giving companies a simpler way to get their products to multiple retailers in a region, but every extra layer in between the manufacturer and the consumer means less profit for the company and / or a higher price for the consumer to pay. India isn't an easy market to break into In February of last year, Motorola was the first company to experiment with an online-only sales model. The company decided to skip the middlemen and get into an exclusive tie-up with Flipkart, India's largest e-commerce store. Motorola’s success selling the Moto X, Moto G, and Moto E online helped to pave the way for Xiaomi and other players to follow. The first phone that Xiaomi launched in India was the Mi 3. When the phone came to India last July, Xiaomi had just unveiled the Mi 4 in China, but that didn’t stop the Mi 3 from becoming an instant hit. The company was selling smartphones as fast as it could import them from China, experiencing similar success with subsequent launches like the Redmi 1S and the Redmi Note. How did a relatively unknown brand from China make such an impact in India? So how did a relatively unknown brand from China make such an impact in India without spending any significant amount of money on marketing or roping in Bollywood superstars to endorse its products? The answer is simple: pricing. Unlike in the US and most other developed markets, mobile operators in India do not subsidize smartphones. In fact, buying a SIM card and buying a mobile phone are, in most cases, completely independent transactions, though some mobile operators will happily sell you a phone as well. This means that an overwhelming majority of phones sold in the country are unlocked, contract-free, and, as a result, available only when you pay their full price. In markets like India, it is not uncommon for people to spend a couple months' worth of salary to buy a phone, so you can understand why price is a more sensitive subject. So when Xiaomi introduced the Mi 3 in India, with specifications comparable to the likes of the Samsung Galaxy S5, LG G3, and Sony Xperia Z3, but at a price tag that was nearly one-third of its more illustrious rivals, it's no surprise that it was an instant hit in the country, despite the fact Xiaomi was pretty much an unknown name as far as the Indian consumers were concerned. While Xiaomi itself has not spent any money on direct marketing, teaming up with Flipkart not only gave it access to a large platform and its marketing dollars, it also imbued Xiaomi with an implicit trust  — the idea being that if it’s good enough for Flipkart to promote, it must be good, period. That’s something that most Chinese brands entering the country usually struggle with. Companies like Huawei have spent large sums of money on celebrity endorsements and other marketing activities, but Xiaomi has been able to surpass them all. Hugo Barra, a well-known face at Google before he joined Xiaomi back in 2013 to become its official brand ambassador outside of China, has played a big part in the company's rise as well. During his public appearances, Barra comes across as extremely approachable and is always happy to answer questions — a refreshing change from most executives in India. With Google arguably being the most admired tech company in India, Barra's connection with Mountain View doesn't hurt his image either. Hugo Barra played a huge part in Xiaomi's rise Toward the end of January, Xiaomi launched the Mi 4 in India, carrying a price tag that was nearly 50 percent higher than its predecessor. While the first sale went well, demand for the smartphone seemed to slow down from the second week onward, as we stopped seeing the ""Sold out in X seconds"" proclamations on Twitter that had become a weekly trend with other products. The Mi 4 was the first real bump in the road for Xiaomi in India, and one can't help but feel that the price, more than any factor, was the real reason behind this. When Mi 3 first came to India, it was totally unique in terms of its value proposition, and it took everyone by surprise. As it happens, consumers got used to this pretty quickly, and ""great specifications at an affordable price"" became Xiaomi's thing. Clearly, the Mi 4 failed to live up to this sentiment. At the recent launch of Xiaomi Redmi 2 in New Delhi, someone actually posed this exact question about the $100 device: ""Yes, the device is a great value, but where's the Mi 3-like 'wow factor' in terms of pricing?"" Even the usually unflappable Hugo Barra had no answer to that. Until today, that is, when Xiaomi unveiled the Mi 4i, which it hopes will ""wow"" the Indian consumer once again. Based on what we've seen of the device — and most importantly of the price tag — I wouldn't bet against India falling in love with another Mi.",0.6013759427589864,0.3986240572410136,0.8429048976100272,1047,4.7612225405921684,534,5.8913857677902621,0,0,"Google, Mobile, Tech, Report",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Did we mention the digs at Apple?    The Mi 4i isn't a radical departure from the Mi 4 in terms of design, but there are enough changes to make it perhaps the best-looking Xiaomi phone we've come across to date. The Mi 4’s metal frame has given way to a fully polycarbonate body, but the Mi 4i has more emphasized corners and an overall finish that's reminiscent of high-end Lumia devices. Most importantly, by pricing it at 12,999 rupees (about $205), Xiaomi has ensured it won't be repeating the mistakes it made with the Mi 4, which cost significantly more at launch. The Mi 4i has a faster processor than the Mi 4, but a lower price tagThe new phone is powered by a second-generation Qualcomm Snapdragon 615, which offers some improvements over the previous generation chip, such as a faster speed. The octa-core processor now has four 1.7GHz cores to do the heavy lifting, while four more power-saving 1.1GHz cores handle background activities. Other specifications include a 5-inch 1080p display, 2GB of RAM, 16GB of storage, MiUi 6 based on Android 5.0.2 Lollipop, and a 3120mAh battery that's ""designed to give one and a half days of real-world usage."" The 13-megapixel rear camera features improved HDR capabilities, and the 5-megapixel front camera comes with a ""beautify"" feature that purports to remove blemishes from your selfies. The frequency with which this feature is popping up on new smartphones sums up everything that's wrong with the world today. Xiaomi Mi 4i imagesPreviousNextView full GalleryPreviousNext Two features that Barra demonstrated while on stage captured our attention more than any others. The Mi 4i comes with what Xiaomi is calling a ""Sunlight Display"" that adjusts images to look good under all types of light. The demo video showed the phone — when exposed to a bright light — automatically adjust under- and over-exposed parts of the picture to give it a more consistent look. As soon as the light source was removed, the image went back to its original state. We are not sure how useful this will be beyond tricking people into thinking they are better photographers than they actually are, but we can't wait to test it and find out more about how it works. Visual IVR aims to do for Interactive Voice Response menus what the original iPhone did for voicemail The other feature is Visual IVR. In name as well as function, Visual IVR aims to do for Interactive Voice Response menus what the original iPhone did for voicemail, though funnily enough, this was the one time when Barra didn't make any Apple references. If it works as advertised, you will no longer have to wait through a prerecorded 60-second spiel to learn that you have to press 9 to talk to a real human being — all options will be on your screen the moment you dial in. The technology behind this is as low-tech as it gets — Barra and company are planning to crowdsource the building of IVR trees for various services from the legions of fans the company has amassed. With Mi fans outnumbering the press and other attendees at least three to one for this event, Barra needn't have worried about any of his jokes falling flat. Pretty much everything he said was greeted with enthusiasm, with the loudest cheers reserved for instances when the iPhone 6 or iPhone 6 Plus were featured in yet another unflattering comparison against the Mi 4i. And if there's one thing we learned from the sea of people that rushed toward the stage to get their selfies with him, it's that Mi fans will always find time for Xiaomi.",0.6789199539194859,0.3210800460805141,0.22497173529290557,783,4.7637292464878671,435,5.9701149425287356,0,2,"Google, Mobile, Tech",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

High above the Earth, astronauts aboard the International Space Station are playing with fire — very carefully. By lighting controlled fires and watching them burn, the Expedition 35 team is learning how to prevent accidental blazes from breaking out aboard the station and other spacecraft — a nightmare scenario that could put not only lives, but the very future of human spaceflight at risk. ""We can certainly make things not flammable on Earth, but in space, that changes,"" said Dr. Paul Ferkul, a NASA scientist whose experiment recently found that a fire-resistant fabric similar to astronaut clothing actually ignites in space.  ""in space, [fireproofing] changes."" Concerns about accidental fire in space are valid, given that in 1997, a malfunction aboard the Russian Mir space station ignited a small blaze  so hot it melted parts of the metal interior. Though quickly extinguished by US and Russian astronauts, the incident raised concerns at NASA about the future of space fire safety. There has never been an accidental fire aboard the International Space Station. But that said, it’s been clear since the onset of human spaceflight during the Cold War that the unique, low-gravity environment of Earth’s orbit has strange effects on fire and firefighting efforts. NASA began earnest space fire research in the 1980s, as the Space Shuttle program took off, and work has been going on aboard the International Space Station since 2002, when a special insulated laboratory called the Microgravity Science Glovebox was brought aboard. Acrylic sphere sample burning aboard the International Space Station as part of Paul Ferkul's BASS experiment (Credit: NASA/BASS/Flickr). In order to make sure nothing like the Mir incident or worse happens aboard the ISS, dozens of researchers around the world are using the glovebox and other equipment to understand how fire, flammable materials, and extinguishers behave differently in space than they do on Earth. ""Each time we do an experiment, we look at how flames form and how fire might propagate in microgravity,"" said Tracy McMahan, a spokesperson for NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center. ""more dangerous or less dangerous in space?"" It’s now known that fire in space burns at lower temperatures and more slowly, and that fire extinguishers relying on pressurized liquids can actually cause fires to spread and grow. But to this day, many fundamental questions remain. ""If something is marginally flammable on Earth, is it more dangerous or less dangerous in space?"" Ferkul asked. As it turns out, his research may have just answered that question for a fabric containing one common clothing material: cotton. In a paper being presented at a conference later this month, Ferkul and his collaborators found that a certain blend of cotton-fiberglass fabric designed to be flame-retardant on Earth actually burned in space when exposed to a stream of air meant to extinguish it. Although this specific blend of cotton-fiberglass isn’t used on the station itself, ""there are many materials up there like this,"" Ferkul noted,  ""including some astronaut clothing fabric, and there’s no reason why [the results] wouldn’t apply to other materials that are similar."" Still frames of an acrylic sphere burning as part of an experiment aboard the International Space Station. Shooting nitrogen at the flame temporarily dampens it, but then once the flow is stopped, the flame grows (Credit: NASA/BASS). Ferkul and colleagues tweaked the test fabric composition, increasing cotton content relative to the fiberglass to make the fabric slightly flammable on Earth. The goal was to compare the differences in burn potential on the ground and in space. On Earth, it was only able to burn in the direction of air flowing into the fire. But in space, it was able to burn both in the direction of the air flow and against it. That’s because of the buoyancy of air itself: hot air on Earth rises, drawing cooling air into a lit fire and regulating its size and speed. But in space, there is no buoyancy, so ""if you get just enough oxygen to the flame, the flame is able to spread happily,"" Ferkul explained. ""This type of situation could occur."" Although Ferkul’s experiment was contained in entirely within the shielding of the Microgravity Science Glovebox laboratory on the ISS, he noted that the results could be applied to the rest of the station. ""This type of situation could occur in some manner if there was an accident up there,"" he said. Specifically, Ferkul noted that the air flow circulation system aboard the station, which relies on fans, could blow oxygen into this type of fire, allowing it to spread.

Ferkul’s current round of experiments aboard the station are due to conclude soon, but a follow-up experiment is planned for March 2014. In the meantime, several other fire and combustion experiments will be taking place in the same test glovebox. ""This is getting pretty widespread attention,"" Ferkul said of the issue of space fire safety. In fact, research has gained new urgency as commercial companies such as SpaceX and Virgin Galactic look to launch humans into orbit in the near future. As for his results, Ferkul said that NASA is unlikely to move to develop a new fabric for astronauts to wear on the station anytime soon. ""The reality is that it is difficult to produce a fire-safe fabric as comfortable as cotton,"" he told The Verge. Still, he said they could be used to improve computer simulations of how flammable objects become in low gravity environments, as well as on Earth. ""The fundamental knowledge gained can be applied to a wide variety of terrestrial combustion problems,"" he said.",0.3981307671476576,0.6018692328523424,0.8586649540657848,980,5.194897959183673,477,6.4339622641509431,0,0,"Science, Report",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The oldest continuous CO2 measuring station in the world, an observatory on the Mauna Loa volcano in Hawaii, reported that levels of the greenhouse gas have reached 400 parts per million (ppm) — an amount not seen in at least three to five million years, by the observatory's estimate. Levels of CO2 traditionally fluctuated between 200 and 300 ppm between warm periods and ice ages on the earth, but since the industrial revolution, concentrations of the gas have been slowly — and now, rapidly — rising. When measurements began in Mauna Loa in 1958, CO2 levels were as low as 317 ppm. Though the number 400 is in itself an arbitrary data point, it's certainly a stark reminder of the still-growing problem of greenhouse gas emissions. The earth is now warmer than it has been in at least 11,300 years, and it's leading to more extreme weather patterns that are only predicted to get worse. Reaching 400 ppm is ""now a done deal,"" said researcher Ralph Keeling, whose father began taking the CO2 measurements in 1958.

It was 13 days until the cow was traced back to the farm where it was born — in Alberta, Canada. The government jumped to contain the disease, but the lack of information was limiting. Even today, just 37 percent of the estimated 1.4 million livestock farms in the US are registered with the federal government. Information on individual animals is even scarcer. Inspectors were able to trace one of the mad cow’s calves back to a feeding operation, for example, but couldn’t identify it in the herd. As a result, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service killed all the calves on site. If more ranchers adopted the electronic tracking technology that has been around for years, tracing disease would be faster and more precise. Short-range radio frequency identification (RFID) is used by a minority of US farms but is increasingly common in parts of Europe, Latin America, and across Australia. Canada has had a mandatory electronic ID rule since 2011. Cattle can be tracked as easily as jeans in a Walmart RFID microchips can be implanted into animals, or swallowed and lodged in the rumen part of the stomach. Most commonly, it’s in a disc slightly thicker than a quarter which is attached to the animal’s ear. With RFID, cattle can be tracked as easily as jeans in a Walmart. Besides assisting with disease traceability, RFID tags allow ranchers to instantly pull up information on an animal's lineage, weight, health records, and production history. Ranchers can also see tidbits of data such as when the cow is at the feeding trough, a metric for health. Weighing cows takes a few hours instead of a few days, using a scale affixed with an RFID reader. The tags even sync with existing cattle management software such as Herd-Pro or CattleMax. Electronic tracking has a ton of potential, which is why the industry leader Allflex was bought for $1.3 billion after a fierce bidding war last week. Allflex first introduced electronic tags in 1993, and the business has been growing ever since. Electronic tracking make ranchers’ lives easier — see CattleMax’s article, ""Four Benefits of Cattle Management in the Cloud"" — and it also creates opportunities for crunching the aggregate data. One company, called Vital Herd, believes it can save four million cattle a year by intensely monitoring for signs of illness. Cow being scanned by RFID reader.   Some researchers are using pedometers to track cattle movements, while others are using GPS. USDA researcher Dean M. Anderson developed a GPS-enabled collar that shocks cows when they wander out of range, eliminating the need for a fence. Adoption of electronic tagging is still very low in the US, however. After the mad cow disease scare, only about 10 percent of American cattle had electronic IDs. In fact, many ranchers don’t individually identify cattle at all, even manually. They’re not required to do so. The USDA proposed requiring electronic tags for all cattle by 2006, but ranchers resisted. Instead, the USDA started phasing in a voluntary National Animal Identification System, which allowed for tattoos, plastic tags, and metal tags, as well as electronic IDs. The agency phased the program out in 2009 ""due to the level of opposition in the countryside,"" a USDA spokesman said in an email. Many ranchers don’t individually identify cattle at all ""Small ranchers say it’s too expensive. Then there are some concerns over privacy, and typical resistance to the government,"" said Terrell Miller, cofounder of Cattlesoft, which makes CattleMax. The electronic tag costs twice as much as a plastic one. The electronic tags can’t be seen from far away, so ranchers usually end up buying both. The system also requires software, a computer, and RFID readers. Most ranches in the US have 100 cows or fewer, meaning they don’t have much margin to adopt new technology. (Amish farmers also objected since they avoid all technology on moral grounds.) A sophisticated, federal system for tagging livestock may be more of a benefit to ranchers than an issue of public safety, considering the rareness of mad cow and other diseases. RFID also does not help or prevent contamination that happens after slaughter, as in the horse meat scandal that swept Europe two months ago. The business community certainly thinks electronic livestock tracking is about to get big, but there was similar hype back in 2004. RFID is being applied sporadically across the US, including one dairy farm where cows were tweeting about how much milk they produced. Retailers say sales of electronic tags are strong, but not spiking. But without a national law or some serious subsidies, widespread adoption seems unlikely in the near future.",0.3784031175621086,0.6215968824378915,0.8434251911647771,830,5.0831325301204817,468,6.2179487179487181,0,0,"Policy & Law, Science, Report",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Now, a new study published in Ecology Letters shows in addition to that tradeoff, the mycorrhizal fungus network that connects many plants actually lets those plants defend themselves against enemies like aphids. As reported by the BBC, the study focused on the chemical response many plants emit when under attack from aphids, which commonly feed on damaged plants — the response typically repels the attacks and also the aphid's natural predator. As part of the test, the researchers grew five broad bean plans — three that were connected through the mycorrhizal fungi network, and two that didn't have that network in place, and all of the plans were covered with bags to prevent chemical communication through the air. The researchers then let a single plant be attacked with aphids, and discovered that un-infested plants began to mount the same chemical defenses, thanks to communication through the fungi network. Plants that weren't connected to the fungi, however, did not mount their defenses.

The four solar arrays that provide power to the station are each cooled independently with their own thermal control systems (pictured above), meaning that the rest of the arrays can continue to function normally while everyone troubleshoots the problem. The faulty loop is the same one that astronauts worked on during a November spacewalk, but it’s not clear whether the leak is now coming from the same location or somewhere else on the structure. Speaking to Space.com, NASA spokesman Kelly Humphries said, ""it is in the same area, but we don’t know whether it’s the same leak.""    Plans are being worked out to reroute the affected power systems According to early analysis, the leak might require a shutdown of the affected cooling loop within 24 hours, but plans are being worked out to reroute the affected power systems so everything can continue to run normally. Commander Chris Hadfield, the Canadian astronaut leading the station’s Expedition 35 crew, is scheduled to return to Earth on Monday along with astronauts from the US and Russia, and so far it doesn’t sound like the leak will affect the undocking plans. Update: Hadfield said on his prolific Tumblr account that preparations are underway for astronauts to do another spacewalk to fix the source of the leak on the outside of the station. The spacewalk is scheduled for Saturday, May 11th, Hadfield noted on Twitter. Good Morning, Earth! Big change in plans, spacewalk tomorrow, Chris Cassidy and Tom Marshburn are getting suits and airlock ready. Cool!   Update 2: NASA held a news conference Friday afternoon to say that the spacewalk was scheduled for 8:15 AM ET on Saturday, May 11th, and repairs would take up to six hours. The agency reiterated that there was no risk to astronaut safety, but noted that if the cause of the leak could not be identified and fixed during Saturday's spacewalk, NASA might have to turn off one power system, which could hamper research aboard the station. ""If we have to be down one power system, that has a pretty significant impact on us,"" said NASA International Space Station Program manager Michael Suffredini during the news briefing.

In a NASA-funded study published in Science, a team of experts evaluated extremely small quantities of water inside volcanic glass samples brought back from the Moon. Their goal was to zero in on hydrogen and its heavier isotope, deuterium: water molecules have different ratios of deuterium to hydrogen, depending on where they originated in the solar system. ""Think of this as looking for a fingerprint for water's origin,"" study author Alberto Saal, Ph.D., an associate professor of Geological Sciences at Brown University, told The Verge. ""This ratio is that fingerprint.""    ""Looking for a fingerprint for water's origin."" Earlier research suggested that the deuterium-hydrogen ratio from Moon water samples was quite high, Saal said. Such a ratio indicated to experts that the Moon's water was derived from collisions with comets. This latest study, however, calls that idea into question: using ""the best samples we have so far"" from the Moon, researchers found that the deuterium-hydrogen ratio appears to be quite low. In fact, it's about the same as the ratio from water found in carbonaceous condrites — meteorites thought to have supplied Earth with its own water supply. ""What this tells us is that water on Earth shares the same source as water on the Moon,"" Saal said. ""And not from comets."" ""There's a problem with this theory."" That's interesting enough on its own, but the research is more significant in the context of the Moon's origins. Right now, experts posit that the Moon was formed during a massive impact that essentially broke off a piece of our planet. Such an impact, however, would have generated enough heat to vaporize any water. ""How did the hydrogen survive? Honestly, we don't know,"" Saal said. ""There's a problem with this theory."" And this isn't the first recent study to poke holes in the longstanding idea of a ""Big Impact"" triggering the Moon's formation: Earlier this year, scientists discovered significant quantities of water deep inside ancient Moon rock samples, also suggesting that the Moon has harbored water since it was formed. Scientists continue to unravel the mystery Despite the ongoing uncertainty, there's no doubt that scientists will continue to unravel the mystery: NASA in 2017 will deploy a water-hunting rover designed, in part, to analyze isotopes in recovered water samples.",0.4407055638703622,0.5592944361296378,0.1700580357613101,414,5.1763285024154593,241,6.1120331950207465,0,0,Science,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The Washington Post highlights the soaring nightly rates for hotel rooms and a possible space shortage, juxtaposing them against three iconic ""ghost hotels,"" big, beautiful buildings that have stood vacant and unfinished for years thanks to government red tape.  The modernist Gávea Tourist and Nacional, as well as the art deco Hotel Glória, were all built in the early to mid-20th century and could provide over 400 rooms to help meet the needs of the metropolis. But since their previous owners abandoned them years or decades ago, they've fallen into various states of almost post-apocalyptic disrepair, with the Gávea Tourist described as having creeping vines and bullet holes throughout its soaring concrete floors.

But for users and entrepreneurs, the global legal landscape is murky at best. More and more governments are coming out with semi-official opinions on how the virtual currency Bitcoin should be treated under the law. Many countries such as Germany have explicitly stated that Bitcoin is not legal tender and cannot be used to pay taxes, while others such as Canada have said that taxes must be paid on income earned in Bitcoin. But most countries are in wait-and-see mode: ""At the moment, we’re studying Bitcoin and we have no plan to issue a regulation on it,"" a spokesperson for the Bank of Indonesia told the Jakarta Globe in December. At the urging of Sen. Tom Carper (D-DE), the chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, the Law Library of Congress has surveyed 40 jurisdictions and the European Union to see which ones have set down rules for Bitcoin. Only China and Brazil have made new laws for Bitcoin The conclusion: not many countries have locked down their legal interpretation of the virtual currency. China and Brazil have the most specific laws to date. The Chinese government has declared it illegal to use as a currency, while the Brazilians set out a framework for its formalized adoption under Law No. 12,865. ""Overall, the findings of this report reveal that the debate over how to deal with this new virtual currency is still in its infancy,"" the report concludes. The US, where most Bitcoin users live, is at the fore of this legal frontier.

At the beginning of the broadcast, host Larry Wilmore expresses confusion at having to do a second episode, but everyone on set is a little dazed that the show is happening at all. The entire staff are pros — they'd have to be to rise to the challenge of taking over The Colbert Report's post-Daily Show spot on Comedy Central — but that doesn't mean it isn't taking them a little time to get their bearings and stop worrying about whether or not we'll think they're funny. Tonight, that anxiety mostly manifests itself in self-deprecating jokes about their production values. In his pre-show remarks, WiImore asks how we like the way the set — particularly the large panel table — looks, and tells us that some people have expressed confusion at the design. He's faux-hurt, but it still sounds like it stings — it's his show, after all. That attitude helps contribute to a scrappy upstart vibe at the taping — it may be airing on Comedy Central with a massive marketing campaign, but to us, it's still an underdog. And we respond accordingly. It's only the second episode, but when Wilmore walks over to the table, everyone chants ""Larry! Larry! Larry!"" That's just what you do at a show like this. When Wilmore walks over to the table, everyone chants ""Larry! Larry! Larry!"" But if the show's first few episodes are any indication, The Nightly Show is a lot closer to the finish line than one might have predicted. Having already watched the very solid premiere episode the night before, I had some idea of what to expect when I showed up for the Tuesday taping. Out in the line, my friend shared his opinion of the show so far: The panel segment was the best, and he hopes Wilmore keeps it up. In that case, ""It'll be like Bill Maher, but funny and not racist!"" He's not wrong, since Wilmore describes the show as a blend of The Daily Show and Maher's Politically Incorrect. If there's any TV format more rigidly formulaic than the late-night talk show, it's the Sunday morning political hour. ABC's This Week (where, in the interest of full disclosure, I was an intern), CBS' Face The Nation, and of course NBC's Meet The Press are, essentially, a three-card monte of information — for the most part, they plow through ""the same dozen lawmakers, journalists, and pundits in a rotating order."" They thrive on the presence of those personalities and their prepared statements, which are ""newsworthy"" and make good television because of who they are. And they have more viewers than The Daily Show. ""It'll be like Bill Maher, but funny and not racist!"" On The Nightly Show, what's important is what the guests have to say. The first episode had big names, even if they are only stars among a small segment of the population — Talib Kweli, Bill Burr, rising political star Cory Booker. (And, of course, ratings will dictate that Wilmore's bookers take big names where they can find them.) But the second episode shifted focus to voices that likely wouldn't be seen on television, and their thoughts on a single issue — the preponderance of rape allegations against Bill Cosby. The focus on one topic suggests another show helmed by a former Daily Show correspondent. But where Last Week Tonight takes more of a newsmagazine approach, digging in and researching on a particular topic that might not be in the headlines, The Nightly Show's reliance on panels creates a discussion about the implications of the news and how we should think about it. That's not to say that Wilmore doesn't inject himself as a host. ""We'll answer the question, ‘Did he do it?'"" he says at the top of the show, suggesting a Dateline-like investigative report of the sort that usually ends with a soft ""maybe."" Instead, he commits: ""The answer will be yes."" Or, put another way, ""That motherfucker did it!"" But the real center of attention is the dynamic between the panel members and the strength of their arguments — ""The proof is common sense,"" as Wilmore puts it. Though there are jokes, there's also a sincere conversation about the implications of patriarchy and the way Cosby's celebrity contributed to a collective unwillingness to believe his accusers, motivated largely by Ebony digital editor Jamilah Lemieux, who gets to make points about the way women who accuse men of rape are marginalized (when was the last time a rape victim got anything out of lying?). So the veneer of a comedy show allows the expression of uncomfortable truths and opinions in honesty. During the segment explicitly devoted to honesty — ""Keep It 100"" — there was a real, off-the-cuff fight between Keith Robinson and Baratunde Thurston over the relative importance of Thurston's integrity and racial identity that was entertaining, revealing, and passionate. It was excellent television. It's rare for there to be a new thing in late night, but The Nightly Show seems to have gotten its best material from cobbling together the parts of several other genres and using them to support each other in the pursuit of presenting a consistent, thoughtful take on the world. Where The Daily Show and The Colbert Report classified themselves as ""fake news,"" an umbrella under which they hid from criticism, The Nightly Show seems much more like ""news with jokes and moral perspective."" And, from my brief experience in the studio, the audience appears to be a crucial part of both parts. Rather than simply padding out the show with laughs, the bits the studio audience most applauded were statements about the travesty of the way rape victims are treated, or Wilmore rejecting anyone who cared whether the total number of accusers was 34 or 35. When Robinson claimed that some of Cosby's accusers were lying, there were audible boos. So much of television production — especially late night TV — is an alchemy of balancing hundreds of factors, from the chemistry of a cast (something late night shows essentially have to reset every night by putting their host next to a different guest), to the coordination between the crew to effectively capture the show, to the writers, who are often trying to figure out a series' strengths months into the process. The first few months of any late night show are, essentially, watching a work in progress — a series of drafts for a consistent show. The taping of the second episode of The Nightly Show was close to the roughest version of that draft, and right now it's using everything in its toolkit, even its audience, to advance the blend of satire, news, and political talk show it's shooting for. Will it succeed? ""Relax,"" Wilmore repeatedly says during the pre-show Q&A. They're still figuring it out.

According to Deadline, Netflix has agreed to finance four movies produced by the Duplass Brothers, two darlings of the indie world who are now going more mainstream with projects like their HBO show Togetherness. Each of the four films will reportedly get a short theatrical release before heading onto Netflix, where they'll presumably remain as exclusives. That's an atypical deal for Netflix given that it isn't a fan of release windows, but one would imagine that it hasn't agreed to very long ones.  ""The reason we do things like the Adam Sandler deal is so we can do things like this."" Mark and Jay Duplass got their start with low-budget, low-production-quality comedies, but the duo has more recently been working with known actors and making bigger films. Even so, their work still maintains those early indie sensibilities — be it quirk or quiet relationship drama — meaning that Netflix isn't picking up a series of mainstream pictures here. Instead, Netflix is financing some small films that are likely to find a respectable audience because of the force behind them. Netflix's ability to easily present these movies to the right viewers also makes this a much more valuable deal. Interestingly enough, Netflix actually bought the Duplass Brothers' first feature film, The Puffy Chair, back in 2006. That was during Netflix's first — and forgotten — period of acquiring original movies for DVD distribution. ""This is just the latest step in our very long relationship with the Duplass Brothers,"" Ted Sarandos, Netflix's chief content officer, tells Deadline. ""We’ve been working with them almost since the very beginning, when we were red-envelope delivery."" When Netflix first started buying up movies in the mid-2000s, it was focused primarily on smaller films like those the Duplass' made. That hasn't been the case over the past two years — it now wants to go big, with big names like Kevin Spacey and David Fincher — but Sarandos says that this isn't its entire plan. ""Independent film has always been a big part of Netflix,"" he tells Deadline, ""and the reason we do things like the Adam Sandler deal is so we can do things like this as well."" That's good news for indie fans.

Oh cool, good to know, yeah, you’ll definitely check it out one of these days. So it’s sort of nice that the first film that I and many people saw at Sundance this year will soon be available to stream through your personal cinema-killing device on Netflix. While I overheard some mild grumbles about this — how unspecial and nonexclusive! — it’s a big cred win for Netflix, which also premiered the Mitt Romney campaign doc Mitt  last year (which is still very much worth checking out).  What Happened, Miss Simone? is director Liz Garbus’ tribute to the legendary Nina Simone, told primarily through archival footage and interviews with a handful of those closest to her. The footage is the real treat and reason to watch, and Garbus knows when to hang back and let a performance play itself out. There’s a particularly great, mind-blowing clip of Simone playing on Playboy’s Penthouse with an introduction from a very young Hugh Hefner. Watching Simone play her dreamlike rendition of “I Loves You Porgy” for a room full of skinny blonde Playboy hopefuls is one of those images that just sticks with you. It feels alien and archaic, but also like it could have happened yesterday. Interviews with her longtime guitarist Al Shackman are the most candid and revealing, but the extremely exclusive circle of sources feels a little constraining by the second half. (Garbus’ primary interviews are Shackman, Simone’s daughter Lisa Simone Kelly, and her ex-husband and former manager Andrew Stroud, with whom she had a frequently toxic, chaotic relationship.) Still, that’s probably preferable to the ""10 bespectacled music journalists tell you why this is important"" pattern many musical documentaries fall into. Thankfully, for the most part Garbus lets Simone tell her story in her own words and music.  The screening was in the Eccles Theatre, which is pretty much a school auditorium. (This prompted me to wonder where they ship all the children of Park City while the Hollywood bigwigs invade their schools and libraries. Is there some kind of exchange program? Do they all just move into Harvey Weinstein’s house?) After the lights came up we were treated to a surprise performance by John Legend, who played a few of Nina’s songs for us, including ""Lilac Wine"" and her version of ""Don’t Let Me Be Misunderstood."" The lights were left on in the theater, lending it a kind of school assembly / talent show vibe. John Legend has a beautiful voice of an angel, but almost two hours with the endlessly complicated, multidimensional voice of Miss Simone was kind of a hard act to follow. So I used the opportunity to look at Twitter and was on the receiving end of some serious mad-dogging from local moms / Legendistas. Afterwards, I headed back to the center of town, got denied at my first Sundance Party (oooh, it hurts so good!), and, in my literal exile on Main Street, spent the next hour wandering up and down, taking in the local color on the still sparsely populated main drag. Let me tell you, all of your favorite brands have already arrived at Sundance: Acura! YouTube! Chase Sapphire Preferred! Stella Artois!

He's shoved into a dubstep-soundtracked stadium, and a woman with a microphone says, ""You. Are. Pac-Man."" He darts through the maze — sweaty, exhilarated, kind of drunk.

The commercial's ""Up For Whatever"" tagline continues from last year, when Bud Light's Super Bowl commercial planted a guy in a pseudo-reality hidden camera show.

Three years after VR made its debut at Sundance, the technology has fully established itself. An entire section of the festival is now devoted to VR experiences, many of them more interactive than what we’ve seen to date. Talk to filmmakers and they’ll tell you they can’t remember being so excited: some say it’s like they’re present at the dawn of a new medium.  Take Birdly, a full-body VR experiment that turns you into a bird flying above the streets of San Francisco, soaring higher with every flap of your arms. Or Project Syria, which throws the viewer in the middle of a harrowing rocket attack. Or, perhaps most darkly, Perspective; Chapter I: The Party, which lets you see the world through the eyes of a man, and then a woman, as an encounter at a college party turns into sexual assault. All are on display at New Frontier, Sundance’s annual showcase for works at the intersection of art and technology. And they’ve quickly become the talk of the festival.   Virtual reality debuted at Sundance in 2012 with Nonny de la Peña’s Hunger in Los Angeles, which used an early head-mounted display to place viewers in the middle of a food line outside a church. That project was developed by then-19-year-old Palmer Luckey, and the success of Hunger spurred him on to build a consumer version of his VR headset. He called it Oculus Rift, and launched it successfully on Kickstarter; last year, Facebook bought his company for $2 billion. In the wake of Oculus’ success, and under the direction of curator Shari Frilot, VR dominates New Frontier this year. ""I think what’s behind the explosion is the marketplace embracing it,"" Frilot says. Of the 14 projects in the showcase, 11 are enhanced by virtual reality. Most are independent art projects, but not all: Fox Searchlight is also here with Wild — The Experience, putting users in between actresses Reese Witherspoon and Laura Dern in a scene inspired by the recent movie of the same name. Unfortunately, several of the experiences at New Frontier replicate the problematic types of VR we’ve seen for years: static scenes, devoid of interaction. And others demonstrate how many of the tricks and techniques that have worked in movies for decades need to be thrown out entirely; Kaiju Fury!, which jumps between a monster fight and a heroine trying to intervene, is an object lesson in how conventional editing can cause VR experiences to collapse almost instantly. But exhibits like Birdly demonstrate how powerful VR can be when it actually lets you do something: in this case, take to the skies with thrilling ease. There’s not a narrative, exactly, but its creators at the Zurich University of the Arts have considered adding one. Hollywood’s recent investment in VR is apparent outside Sundance as well. This week Annapurna Pictures, producer of films like Her and Zero Dark Thirty, announced it is creating a VR division in partnership with artist Chris Milk. Meanwhile, VICE said Friday that it is making forays into VR news documentaries, and 20th Century Fox plans to release several more experiences this year as part of its Fox Innovation Lab. ""It really starts this year,"" says Fabian Troxler, a co-founder of Birdly. ""People realize you can do so much more than gaming stuff. You can also tell stories."" Which isn’t to say that VR has fully arrived: ""It’s still new and there are still a lot of troubles we have to solve,"" he says. Birdly is highly immersive even for VR: fans blow air on you as you fly, and headphones simulate whooshing noises dependent on your movements. Troxler’s team is currently working to insert smells into the simulation — anything, he says, to further the suspension of disbelief. Fox’s Wild — The Experience was created by the duo of Félix Lajeunesse and Paul Raphaël, better known as Felix and Paul. In addition to Wild, the directors brought two other pieces to New Frontier this year designed for the Samsung Gear VR: one in which Montreal musician Patrick Watson gives an intimate performance in his loft, and the other depositing you in a series of scenes featuring Mongolian yak herders. (Of course Samsung would sponsor a VR yak herding experience.) Raphaël offers a variety of reasons for the proliferation of VR at Sundance this year. ""People are just finally getting comfortable with it,"" he says. ""The hardware is starting to get more accessible; people are feeling a looming commercial release. There’s more incentive: a lot more studios and companies are investing in the technology. And with more people seeing it, there’s more word of mouth. And it’s an amazing medium."" Just before Sundance opened this year, investor Chris Dixon wrote a blog post predicting that after many false starts, VR-enabled cinema was about to become a reality. ""What’s happening now  — because of Moore’s Law, and also the rapid improvement of processors, screens, and accelerometers, driven by the smartphone boom  —  is that VR is finally ready to go mainstream,"" Dixon writes. He predicted a period of great experimentation. ""The next few decades of VR will be similar to the first few decades of film,"" he writes. ""Filmmakers had no idea what worked and what didn’t: how to write, how to shoot, how to edit, etc. After decades of experiments they established the grammar of film. We’re about to enter a similar period of exploration with VR."" Raphaël agrees with that sentiment: ""There’s no road map,"" he says."" At Sundance, visitors to New Frontier can take home Google Cardboard: the company is giving away up to 8,000 of the do-it-yourself VR kits, while a new app from artist Chris Milk lets both Android and iOS users experience his latest work. And everyone else can watch as VR, slowly but surely, encroaches on territory that was once exclusive to film and TV. ""The medium itself is just so sexy, and so alluring — it captures a general audience’s imagination,"" Frilot says. ""And I think that’s really fueled this hyperspeed at which the industry is developing."" There may even come a day where VR graduates from the experimental New Frontier showcase to a permanent category at Sundance. ""We’ve been talking in our programing meetings about the possibility of potentially building a platform, like we build a platform for documentaries, for feature films, for premieres,"" Frilot says. ""We may need to do that with VR.""",0.7578102565519897,0.24218974344801025,0.1973939874678755,1110,4.9522522522522525,621,6.3123993558776164,0,8,"Culture, Entertainment, Film",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Writers and directors see their work inherently devalued, and the companies financing the projects see less return — potentially impacting their desire to fund future projects. Objectively speaking, piracy is bad. Except when it changes the world. That ‘s the lesson at the heart of Chuck Norris vs. Communism, one of the documentaries screening at this year’s Sundance Film Festival. In the 1980s, Romania was locked down under the Communist regiment of Nicolae Ceausescu. News and media were strictly controlled, the country’s secret police used violence and intimidation to tamp down all dissent, and any entertainment from other countries was chopped up and censored before being made available to Romanian citizens, if at all. Underground movie parties popped up across the country The advent of VHS tapes and VCRs changed the dynamic, however, as a string of Hollywood films began making their way into the country via a black-market ring led by a mysterious figured named Teodor Zamfir. Underground viewing parties popped up as people gathered in secret to watch the best (and worst) work of Sylvester Stallone, Jean-Claude Van Damme, Marlon Brando — and yes, Chuck Norris. Through a series of interviews and dramatic re-enactments, the documentary chronicles how the exposure to movies let people see outside the boundaries of what Ceausescu’s government presented, planting seeds of unrest that eventually played a part in the revolution that overthrew the regime in 1989. It’s a funny, tense, nostalgia-fueled trip full of clips from movies like Missing in Action, 9 1/2 Weeks, and Bloodsport, and speaks to the profound power movies have to change the way people experience the world. Director Ilinca Calugareanu uses her re-enacted sequences to riff on the styles of the bootlegged movies — a Romanian censorship board scene is pure Adrian Lyne, while other sequences call to mind some of the grungy, low-budget action flicks of the era. That framework keeps the documentary moving, but its soul comes from interviews with those that attended the underground screenings, and had their lives changed as a result.   ""We started to want to become heroes,"" says one man who grew up watching bootlegs of action films and the Rocky movies. An older woman describes the eye-opening experience of watching her very first movie — Bernardo Bertolucci’s sexually explicit Last Tango in Paris. It didn’t matter if the movies were Western propaganda, says another young man; at least they weren’t Ceausescu’s propaganda. One woman single-handedly dubbed 3,000 movies Central to the film is the presence of Irina Nistor, the woman who dubbed the English-language movies into Romanian. Handling both male and female roles, Nistor became a folk hero to the underground cinema scene, with audiences equating her voice with the hope and freedom that the uncensored movies themselves evoked. Nistor estimates that she dubbed 3,000 movies before calling it quits, but both in the film and during a post-screening discussion, she insisted that she was never trying to ferment revolution or change; despite the danger, she dubbed the films simply because watching uncensored movies was just too exciting a proposition to pass up. The film drags slightly in its last third, and it doesn’t connect the dots to the Romanian Revolution as clearly as it thinks it does, but neither problem gets in the way of the movie’s fascinating story. And while VCRs have long given way to pirated DVDs and now digital files, the larger theme of Chuck Norris vs. Communism is echoed every time a group uses social media to self-organize, or censored information leaks out online: technology as the mechanism by which the human spirit can rise up against oppression. So if you like movies, you should see this one. Just don’t pirate it when you do.",0.5814336766757076,0.41856632332429244,0.21533285353788803,655,5.1862595419847333,396,6.2474747474747474,0,2,"Culture, Entertainment, Film",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

GoPro has partnered with the NHL to provide its small, rugged cameras for use during live broadcasts of the league's games. This includes first-person footage broadcast from players' helmets and footage captured from cameras around the rink and inside the goals. The NHL intends to start using live GoPro footage during the All-Star Skills Competition on January 24th and potentially during the All-Star Game the following day.  GoPro's cameras will show players' skating and stickhandling As for regular games, GoPro is likely to have a smaller role. Its cameras may still be mounted around the rink and in the goal for live broadcasts, but don't expect to see them hanging off of players' helmets anytime soon. ""I don't see that down the road, where players are wearing it,"" Bob Chesterman, an NHL programming exec, tells The Verge. What is possible is that referees could one day be skating around with them, but even that, Chesterman says, is ""a long way down the road."" Instead, the NHL may start working with helmet manufacturers to add embedded cameras — an integration that seemingly wouldn't involve GoPro but would be a lot safer than using a mounted camera. GoPro has been building toward a major sports deal like this for a little while now. It began testing the use of first-person footage with the NHL last year, and it recently announced a partnership that allows GoPro footage to be broadcast live — lifting perhaps the biggest barrier that prevented use of its cameras during games. The NHL intends to use GoPro footage to demonstrate players' ""skating, stickhandling, goal scoring, and netminding"" skills, saying that it'll allow the league to present better stories. This is also an important step for GoPro, which is trying to make its cameras' footage as marketable as its cameras themselves. To that end, getting that footage in live broadcasts is a big win — even if it won't be doing a lot of first-person work.

If you're not at the festival, chances are you won't be able to see any of these movies until later this year, but trailers are being put out there now to help them start building buzz. And chances are, you'll start hearing quite a bit about some of them. Many of each year's biggest films premiere at Sundance, so pay attention if you want to know what's going to be talked about in the film world over the next several months.   Dope is about how a geek handles the hard streets. It looks like this movie brings some serious attitude, and it's already getting some buzz from the fact that rapper A$AP Rocky plays a role. Also, Bitcoin is involved somehow.   The issue of rape on college campuses is starting to get the attention it deserves, and the documentary The Hunting Ground plans to keep it in the spotlight. The film speaks with survivors and investigates how colleges are dealing with — and covering up — recurring issues of sexual assault.   Another documentary at this year's festival that's ripped out of the current headlines, 3½ Minutes is about a brief encounter at a gas station that led to the killing of an unarmed black teenager. The trailer alone is extremely powerful, so this may be a big one once it premieres.   Yes, it stars James Franco and Jonah Hill, but True Story has the two actors across from one another in dramatic roles. The film is adapted from the memoir of journalist Michael Finkel, who's contacted by an alleged murderer that wants to get his story out.   A beautiful, black-and-white drama that's sure to satiate your French New Wave cravings, Chorus is about a separated couple reuniting when their son's body is found years after his disappearance.   The trailer for Princess is seriously creepy (in part because of the abusive relationships that it hints at), but it also hints at the film's blurring of role play, fantasy, and reality, which is supposed to play a big part in the narrative. It's certainly looks like some intriguing storytelling.   H. has been getting a lot of buzz off of its mysterious first trailer. It's not entirely clear what's going on here — something about a meteor crashing to Earth — but it looks deeply moody.      How would the United Nations handle our first contact with aliens? The Visit is a documentary-style sci-fi film imagining exactly that.   The trailer for Partisan is short but terrifying: the film is about a boy who's a trained assassin beginning to go out into the world.   The director of The Cove is back with a new documentary about mankind's impact on the planet and the potential for another mass extinction.

The spotlight has never been brighter on smartwatches than it is right now, so it shouldn't be too long before we get an official announcement from Samsung.",0.5664782697254791,0.4335217302745209,0.2045897330517555,153,4.8039215686274508,101,5.1980198019801982,0,0,Tech,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Beginning in Q3, the company will roll out a desktop, laptop, and tablet, with all of them focused on providing a top-notch gaming experience. At a global product event today, CEO Jason Chen said the success of Acer's V Nitro series has encouraged the company to go further in targeting gamers. Unlike that V Nitro hardware, all of these products very much look like gaming devices.  The Predator laptop will be available in both 15- and 17-inch configurations and features programmable buttons — which are customizable by game — movement keys, and what Acer describes as a “massive” cooling system to keep the powerful machines running smoothly. Both models will launch in Q4. As for the desktop, Acer isn't yet saying much in regards to tech specs, only promising ""the latest graphics, the latest processors, and the latest chipsets"" when it ships in Q3. And then there's the Predator tablet, which features four front-facing speakers for a surround-like experience. Acer says it will give off haptic feedback during games, much like the gamepads that control your console. ""It’ll shake in your hand as you’re playing,"" an executive said on stage. Rounding out the gaming announcements is a new 35-inch, 21:9 curved gaming monitor that supports N-Vidia's G-Sync and DTS audio. It seems Acer is getting very serious about competing with Alienware, Razer, and other companies that specialize in gaming hardware. But as we said before, Acer's not yet offering details on full hardware specs, let alone pricing or release date.  Photos by Sean O'Kane.

In many cases, the developers who made those apps will be using a Watch for the first time, too. Though Apple has not-so-secretly been inviting developers big and small to trial sessions with the Apple Watch, developers are largely putting out apps that they don't have much actual experience using. ""It's an entirely new platform, and no one has access to one,"" says Adam Grossman, a founder of Dark Sky. ""And yet we're expected to make apps for it."" The task sounds daunting, but it's one that developers seem to be excited about, giving them a chance to play with a whole new platform. ""We had to design an app for a device that we didn't have, that we couldn't use, that doesn't exist yet,"" says Andrew Phelps, product manager for The New York Times' Watch app. ""That was a totally fun and crazy challenge for us.""The trouble is, no one really knows what makes a good Watch app yet. Apple can hand guidelines to developers, but even it doesn't know for certain how people are going to want to use the watch. Developers almost have to code for it, though — waiting means losing ground, users, and publicity to other apps — so thousands are now taking a crack at it and hoping that they get it right. There are two use cases for apps that quickly stand out when you talk to most developers: a Watch app can help you do something faster than a phone app could, or a Watch app can get you to use its corresponding iPhone app even more. Dark Sky only does one of those things — its Watch app is meant to be faster to glance at than its iPhone app — which is why Grossman thinks that his app is a perfect fit for Apple's new device. ""It feels like Dark Sky was really meant to be on the Watch,"" he says. Dark Sky, a forecast app that alerts you ahead of inclement weather, will push a chart of the next hour's rain or snowfall to the Watch before it starts coming down. Normally, the app would just send a brief alert (""Rain starting soon!"") to your phone, and you'd have to open the app to see more. ""A lot of the times it takes longer to get the phone out of your pocket than it does to check the app,"" he says. ""So for us it makes a whole lot of sense to put it on your wrist.""   Dark Sky is the kind of app that translates so naturally to the Watch that it makes you see why the Watch could actually work. But most apps aren't that simple. You don't need to do anything in Dark Sky — you just look at the forecast and then close it. Most other apps have complex functions; you're supposed to use them, often at length. ""We ultimately need be able to help you accomplish something."" That's why many developers are also using the Watch as a way to send people back to their corresponding iPhone apps. Because of that, you may call their presence on the Watch obligatory (and in some cases, it probably is), but apps from The New York Times and Evernote aim to straddle that line, letting you accomplish small tasks and pointing you to your phone when appropriate. ""We ultimately need to be helping you accomplish something,"" says Jamie Hull, Evernote's VP of mobile products. ""Otherwise the app's not particularly valuable."" Evernote has built its Watch app to automatically surface stored notes that are relevant to what a person is doing. Actually reading those notes is a different story: ""We gave ourselves sort of a design rule of thumb: you should be able to get it done in three to five seconds, and if not, we want to bounce you back to the phone,"" Hull says. Evernote's app will even let users search through all of their old notes; but only a few results will surface, and they'll be presented in an abridged format. Try to read too much, and Evernote just won't let you — you'll have to pull out your iPhone.    The New York Times' app blurs the two use cases together. The app displays about half a dozen stories that have been boiled down to just a sentence in length (on the Watch, more detail than a headline) and allows users to add each story to a reading list that they can later pick up on their phone, should they want to know more. The Times' breaking news alerts are meant to serve a similar function. ""If you look at the Watch as a device that helps you decide whether it's worth taking your phone out of your pocket or not, … I think that'll become a very addictive and very useful feature for a lot of people,"" Phelps says. Appropriately, that idea echoes precisely why The New York Times' tech columnist Farhad Manjoo says he began to appreciate using the Apple Watch: ""By notifying me of digital events as soon as they happened, and letting me act on them instantly, without having to fumble for my phone, the Watch became something like a natural extension of my body — a direct link, in a way that I’ve never felt before, from the digital world to my brain."" Of course, that's how Watch apps will function so long as they actually, well, function. The Verge's review of the Apple Watch notes frequent performance issues, both due to the device's limited processing abilities and the fact that nearly all app data is being beamed over from a nearby iPhone. ""The device is first generation,"" Phelps says. ""It has a lot of limitations, and I think readers will blame The New York Times if The New York Times app is slow."" Apps can easily bump up against the Watch's limitations Dealing with those speed issues, for the Times, required making changes to how its app acts to get things running quicker. ""We had to do a lot of work,"" Phelps says. ""Basically shaving every millisecond we could off of installation time, launch time — it came down to even reducing the number of fonts in the binary to make sure that the thing loaded quickly."" Glances — which, as their name suggests, are screens meant to be very quickly glanced over — also ran into performance issues during The Verge's tests. In some instances, they loaded so slowly that you could have pulled out your phone instead, which could really limit their utility to both developers and users. That may not be entirely the Watch's problem, however. ""App developers should pay a lot attention to only put things in there that hopefully are gonna come up in fairly short order,"" says Hull, of Evernote. ""If you know you have to go back to your own servers and do some heavy lifting there via the phone, it might not be appropriate for a Glance."" The Watch also doesn't allow third-party apps to run natively yet, though the developers we spoke with didn't see this as a major problem. Some may wish that their apps could do an additional thing or two — Evernote, for instance, would like to be able to accept dictated notes when a phone isn't nearby — but because the initial round of Watch apps are growing out of traditional iPhone apps, no one really seems to mind that the iPhone has to be around. Parag Vaish, StubHub's head of mobile, says that initial app issues may have more to do with unexpected behavior than with limitations. StubHub's Watch app, for instance, is supposed to allow users to pull up their tickets and present them at a show — but that only works if the Watch’s screen doesn't turn off. ""If you're trying to show a mobile ticket on your Apple Watch to an usher or a ticket taker, the simple fact of you moving it away from your body could have it go dark,"" Vaish says. StubHub says this isn't a problem for most ticketing, since scanners typically come from above, meaning Watch users won't be required to turn their wrists upside down and risk the display turning off. There are also inherent limitations of the hardware that developers will just have to get used to. ""We joke that we hope Arnold Schwarzenegger is not in the news anytime soon,"" Phelps says. ""It simply does not fit on that screen."" Still, one developer The Verge spoke with, who was unable to speak publicly because of an agreement with Apple, said that developers trying to make complicated apps for launch day may just be out of luck; there may be too many potential issues for an app to run into. ""Honestly, I don't know how somebody could build a Watch app without having gone into [Apple's] lab,"" the developer said. While complicated apps may pose problems on launch day, most developers described coding for the Watch as fairly simple. StubHub had one of its developers build a working prototype over a weekend. Evernote even described working on a Watch app as akin to working on a notification screen widget. ""The good news is, the app developer community has certainly had the opportunity to build extensions before this point, which is ultimately what the Watch app is,"" Hull says. And while no one may know exactly what a Watch app should look like, it may not be that hard to build an acceptable one if you follow Apple's suggestions. Grossman, of Dark Sky, says that what you can do with a Watch app is ""very constrained,"" but he sees that as a good thing. ""Apple is kind of leading you down a path,"" he says. ""Ultimately people will want more and more complex experiences on the Watch."" In part, that means keeping Watch apps streamlined and simple. ""We've been at this for about five weeks now, and over the last two weeks we've only removed features from the Watch,"" says StubHub's Vaish. ""Essentially the build we had two weeks ago was more than we needed to have for it to be in the store today. We trimmed it back."" While simplicity may be necessary for now, Phelps, of the Times, suspects that people will want Watch apps to do more in the future. ""I think ultimately people will want more and more complex experiences on the Watch,"" he says. ""But for day one, for a device that is brand new … I think simplicity was key."" Watch apps may evolve in much the same way that iPhone apps did, as developers standardize around symbols, layouts, and interactions that users become accustomed to. Already, Grossman says that he's made Dark Sky better by looking around at other developers' apps. ""The watch is a lot more fluorescent [displaying bright colors on a black background] than the iPhone is,"" he says. ""Looking at other apps made me kind of change Dark Sky from muted colors to more bright, vibrant colors."" Apps are going to have to quickly change to keep up with what people expect from the Watch, especially as more and more people have one. But for the most part, this initial batch of apps may not be far off the mark. ""The apps six months from now are going to be significantly better than the apps on day one,"" Grossman says. ""But I don't think it's going to be a major overhaul in our thinking.""",0.38751476736330803,0.612485232636692,0.17696698204429798,1946,4.4835560123329907,756,5.894179894179894,0,11,"Apple, Apps, Tech",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It’s 3PM, your iPhone is teetering at 10 percent battery, and your friends all want to go out after work, leaving you no time to charge your phone. There’s no way your phone is going to make it. The beads of sweat start to form: “How am I going to sync up with everyone tonight? How will I call that Uber to come pick me up? How will I Instagram my crostini appetizer that never has enough toast?”  This is battery anxiety, and it is real. The iPhone 6 doesn’t make it easy for sufferers of battery anxiety. For many of us, it doesn’t last a full day and it doesn't have as large of a battery as its bigger sibling, the iPhone 6 Plus. But that doesn’t mean all hope is lost. You just need a case that can recharge your iPhone’s battery without having to plug it into the wall. A battery case will protect your phone from the usual dings and damage of day-to-day use, just like any other case. But when your iPhone is getting low on juice, you can just flick a switch on your battery case and recharge it wherever you are — no hunting for an outlet, no tethering to a desk, no hassles required. There are a ton of cases that promise to charge your iPhone while providing protection, and they all work in pretty much the same way. You put your phone inside of it, and the case then recharges the iPhone’s internal battery with its own battery. With most options, you can actually double your time away from a wall outlet. The advantages of having a battery case are many: they eliminate your battery anxiety (or at least extend it until a later time), free you up from being tethered to a wall outlet, and protect your phone from usual wear and tear. The downside is that they make your phone considerably heavier and bulkier, but a good battery case is easy to remove when you don’t need the extra battery capacity. A good case also makes it easy to access the volume buttons and power key on the iPhone and doesn’t block the speaker or microphones. One annoying thing with all of the battery cases is that you need to use a headphone extender to plug in most headphones. Fortunately, all of the cases we tested came supplied with one and most will take Apple’s own EarPods without the adapter. Or you can avoid the problem entirely by using wireless headphones. With so many options available, it can be hard to find the best battery case for your iPhone. But we’ve done the hard work, and when you factor in charging performance, ease of use, and cost, there’s a clear leader in the pack. Shot on location at WeWork. Also available on YouTube. If you’re looking for the best battery case for your iPhone 6, you want the Incipio Offgrid Express. It has a 3,000mAh battery that can fully recharge your dead phone, and then some; a slim, lightweight design; and easy access to the volume buttons and power button, even while wearing gloves. It’s also easy to remove from your iPhone when you don’t need the extra bulk or battery capacity. The Offgrid Express has a battery meter on the front, which can be used to check how much charge is available. It has four LED lights that are easier to read and understand than the single light that many other cases use. Turning on the charging function is as simple as holding down the button on the side of the case for a few seconds — the same action also turns it off. Your iPhone will go from dead to fully charged within a couple of hours, but you can continue to use it the entire time it’s recharging — a big advantage of using a battery case. Recharging the Offgrid Express is done with the included Micro USB cable and any USB port (such as the charging brick that came with your iPhone), and the case will charge your iPhone first before replenishing its own battery when you plug it into the wall. You can even sync with iTunes without having to remove the case from your phone. The downside is that none of the Lightning cables you’ve collected over the years will work with the Offgrid Express, but this is the situation with every case we looked at, and Micro USB cables are pretty cheap and plentiful, so we didn’t find it to be much of an issue. The differences between the Offgrid Express and the many other cases you can choose from are minor, but they add up to a better overall experience. It’s one of the least expensive cases we tested, but it outperformed many of the more expensive options. And it nails all of the key factors you want in a battery case: plenty of battery capacity, easy-to-access buttons, and ease of removal. If you’re looking to avoid that 3PM attack of battery anxiety, the Offgrid Express is the way to go. (Affiliate links are automatically generated by our partner, Skimlinks.

That's changed today with Apple quietly flipping the switch in its app to open up the built-in App Store for WatchKit apps. Right now the store is about as barebones as you can get, with a simple list of of 35 apps with WatchKit integration. Included are apps like Flipboard, Evernote, Twitter, Instagram, and The New York Times, which are being shown off on Apple's site, too. You can download and install these apps right from the list without hopping out to the normal App Store, but a lot of the features you'd find on the usual store are missing — things like search and browsing through genres of apps just aren't there. Read next: Read our Apple Watch review. Right now the store is about as barebones as you can get Oddly enough, there is a larger store hidden within the app (complete with search), which is likely to become the default storefront that people see in the coming days. You can get to it by tapping the App Store tab in the app seven times (Thanks Eytan!). This takes you to a special version of the store with several curated lists of things like ""healthy living,"" ""get stuff done,"" and ""get the score."" Watch App pages have a few things you won't find in the usual App Store — at least for now. Each Watch app has screenshots both of what you'll see on an Apple Watch, and what you'll see on a normal iPhone app. Also, once you've installed any of those apps, you can very quickly hop over to a separate section of the Watch app and toggle whether you want to receive notifications or have them show up on your watch screen, something that's a completely different process for standard iOS apps.   The Apple Watch officially launches tomorrow, with many who preordered back on April 10th getting the first deliveries in time. However unlike with many past new product launches, Apple's provided more vague delivery dates that range several weeks at a time. Those in this first batch are slated to get their Apple Watches sometime between tomorrow and May 8th. Apple yesterday began notifying some customers that their orders were still being worked on, suggesting a delivery timetable sometime in the latter half of that window, in what's since been called the ""email of death"" by expectant buyers. As Buzzfeed — which spotted the feature — notes, there are far more than this smattering of apps that will work with the Apple Watch right out of the gate. Third-party site WatchAware is compiling them, though all are also expected to end up inside the Apple Watch companion app too.

Twitter just announced a new feature called Highlights that serves up a twice-a-day digest of tweets that have been picked out for users. On Android, which Twitter says will be the first platform to get it, Highlights will send people a push notification that opens up a new view in Twitter's app with about a dozen tweets that have been ordered by importance (not chronologically). Users swipe to the left or right to browse them, then can resume using Twitter normally. Twitter says the digest, which requires opting in, is curated from popular accounts and conversations from people that are followed, along with topics and events that are trending. It also gathers tweets from people it believes you're closely tied to, and from accounts that your friends might follow. Introducing Highlights.

The network, which currently consists of a main server and three client machines, has been running continuously in Los Alamos for the past two and a half years, the researchers reported in a paper released earlier this month. During that time, they have also successfully tested sending critical information used by power companies on the status of the electrical grid. Eventually they hope to use it to test offline quantum communication capabilities on smartphones and tablets.    ""prevent a hacking attack on the electrical grid."" ""There's a need for secure communications to prevent a hacking attack on the electrical grid,"" said Richard Hughes, a  fellow at Los Alamos National Laboratory who is involved in the experiment. ""At the same time, there are very demanding requirements for low latency. You can't have the normal time delays introduced by traditional cryptography."" But Los Alamos researchers were able to satisfy the grid's low latency requirement — that is, the need for ultrafast, near real-time communications — as well as improve security, by developing a new type of quantum network. Previously, other types of quantum test networks have required that secure connections, or ""trust,"" be established between every single machine on the network for every type of communication sent, slowing down the rate of transmission. But in the Los Alamos quantum communications network, the central server acts the primary trusted authority, and handles all of the cryptographic key management functions, everything from quantum key distribution (that means sending two machines the keys necessary to establish a secure communications channel between them), to electronic signatures and certificates, which allow the communications to be sent and received. The entire field of quantum cryptography, first proposed in the 1970s, relies on transmitting data in short bursts of light, using quantum physics to encode it, creating a communications channel so secure that the participants will know instantly if it has been cracked. ""We've sent encrypted video with a key that rolls over every second, so even if someone broke an encryption key, it's only valid for a few seconds."" Hughes told The Verge.

Today, Sipho is unemployed, gaunt, and mired in a life of crime outside Durban, where he and untold others have been gripped by a drug known as ""whoonga"" — a potent and highly addictive mixture of marijuana, heroin, and, most shockingly, HIV medications. ""He has lost a lot of weight. He was a very fit and strong boy, and now he is thin and is sick,"" Sarah, Sipho’s mother, said through a translator in an email to The Verge. Sarah, 42, asked that her real name not be disclosed in this report, for fear of reprisal from local gang members and whoonga dealers. ""He cries and hits his head when he cannot get whoonga ... He now steals my money, and has sold all his clothes just for the drug."" ""He was a very fit and strong boy, and now he is thin and is sick."" Antiretroviral (ARV) medications have played an enormous role in stemming the spread of HIV across the globe, but when crushed up and smoked as whoonga, they can destroy lives. Users say the street drug creates intense feelings of ecstasy and euphoria — at least some of which may be attributable to the ARV drug efavirenz, according to new research. This high comes at an enormous cost. According to experts, prolonged use can lead to stomach ulcers, internal bleeding, and excruciating withdrawal symptoms. When Sipho doesn't get his fix, his mother says, he can turn into a monster. ""He becomes mad,"" Sarah says. ""He screams and shouts, and has hit me and my husband already when we tried to keep him at home and not go with the other boys."" Media reports have identified efavirenz as a critical component to whoonga, citing hospital robberies and anecdotes from former dealers. Known in the US by its brand name Sustiva, efavirenz is widely acknowledged as one of the most effective first-line medications in suppressing HIV, and is typically prescribed in conjunction with at least two other drugs. It's also readily available in South Africa, where the government supplies efavirenz free of charge for poor HIV patients. Side effects could explain recreational use   Many have expressed doubts about the illicit use of efavirenz, citing inconclusive evidence on its psychoactive effects, but recent research suggests that the drug may be more potent than previously believed. In a study presented late last month, Dr. John Schetz, a professor of pharmacology and neuroscience at the University of North Texas, found that efavirenz stimulates the same brain receptors that hallucinogens such as LSD act upon. His team's findings, currently under peer review, may explain why some efavirenz users experience side effects including night terrors, hallucinations, and suicidal depression; they may also explain whoonga's purported appeal to recreational drug users. ""The reasons patients experience these neuropsychiatric side effects are probably the same reasons people want to use [efavirenz] recreationally,"" Schetz said in an interview with The Verge. He notes that further research is needed to more fully understand the impact of smoking efavirenz, as well as the drug's interactions with other substances. Based on his findings, though, he says efavirenz ""almost definitely"" has additive effects, enhancing the impacts of marijuana or heroin.  A township outside Durban, South Africa Quintin van Kerken, director of the Anti-Drug Alliance of South Africa, says there's no doubt that addicts are lacing marijuana and heroin with ARV medicines, though it's difficult to gauge how pervasive the practice has become. The South African government does not keep official records on whoonga abusers, and many provinces don't have the resources to conduct chemical analyses of seized supplies. A 2011 study from the University of KwaZulu-Natal found only scant traces of ARV medicines in seized whoonga samples. But Dr. David Grelotti, a researcher at the Harvard School of Public Health, says that as a synthetic street drug, its composition likely varies according to a number of factors. ""we don't really know what's in whoonga all the time."" ""There's probably no confusion that whoonga is abused in South Africa, but there is uncertainty because we don't really know what's in whoonga all the time,"" Grelotti said in an email to The Verge. ""What's in whoonga probably varies depending on what's available when it is being made."" ""HIV medications are added to whoonga,"" he affirms, ""but we don't have any idea how consistently this is happening."" Whoonga use isn't as nationally prevalent as crystal meth, though the drug appears to have taken more of a foothold in South Africa’s poor and predominantly black townships — particularly in the eastern province of KwaZulu-Natal, where peddlers sell whoonga for between 20 and 40 rands a joint (roughly, between $2 and $5). More recently, it's begun spreading to the economic hub of Johannesburg, as well. In KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa's most AIDS-stricken province, there have been reports of dealers robbing HIV patients of their medication as they exit treatment centers, in addition to nighttime thefts of hospital ARV supplies. Others procure the drugs through less violent means, offering to purchase medications from destitute patients or corrupt hospital workers. ""It’s very much a poverty issue."" ""Gangsters or dealers offer money to people who are HIV positive, many of whom come from poor rural areas,"" van Kerken explains. ""And they accept it, because at the end of the day, they need to feed their families. It’s very much a poverty issue."" Experts say hospital robberies and patient muggings have thus far had little effect on AIDS drug supplies. As of 2009, an estimated 5.6 million South Africans were infected with HIV, more than any other country. In recent years, the government has embarked on a massive anti-AIDS campaign, expanding testing centers and subsidizing medical costs for its poorest citizens.   Cathy Vos, national coordinator for the government-funded South African National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence (SANCA), acknowledges that hospital robberies have occurred in recent years, though she describes them as ""isolated incidents."" She also expresses skepticism about the psychoactive effects of efavirenz, arguing instead that dealers may have successfully tricked addicts into believing the drugs boost the high they get from whoonga — a sort of underworld experiment in placebo marketing. But whoonga may still pose a fatal risk for those using it. Late last year, Grelotti coauthored an article in The Lancet, in which he argued that efavirenz abusers could soon become resistant to the drug. Should they later contract HIV, any treatment may be rendered ineffective. ""Resistance to efavirenz can develop relatively easily,"" Grelotti explains, saying such resistance ""could compromise the whole treatment."" ""We worry and ask God to bring him back."" As he and others are quick to point out, efavirenz abuse should not be seen as a reason to abandon the drug altogether. It remains one of the most effective HIV treatments available, and one of the cheapest. Whereas doctors in the US could easily switch to alternative medicines, those in South Africa and other developing nations don’t have many other options. ""We must take great care not to blame patients for this problem,"" Grelotti says, noting that doing so would only exacerbate the stigma from which many HIV patients already suffer. ""We should instead double our efforts to provide people with the care that they need."" He and others say doctors should be more stringent about handing out efavirenz, and that further research is needed to more fully understand the scope of its abuse. Until action is taken, the Molefes and other whoonga-stricken families can do little more than urge addicts to seek rehabilitation, and hope for the best. ""The family are scared of him. We all are,"" Sarah says of her troubled son. ""He sometimes does not come home for many days. We worry and ask God to bring him back.""",0.38792530644186246,0.6120746935581376,0.8412099060783262,1335,5.1333333333333337,688,6.3808139534883717,0,0,"Science, Report",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Starting in the Sun’s outer atmosphere (corona), a CME is a powerful blast of billions of tons of solar gas and parts of the Sun’s magnetic field, which fly toward Earth at around a million miles an hour. Such CMEs thin out as they travel through space over days, and by the time they arrive at our planet, most of them go unnoticed, causing only relatively minor disturbances to our planet’s own magnetic field. Image of a large coronal mass ejection from the Sun in 2003. (Credit: NASA/ESA SOHO.) Every 11 years, the sun enters its cyclical period of increased activity called solar maximum, raising the potential for CMEs up to every few days. During this time, there is a heightened chance of especially powerful CMEs with magnetic fields pointed in the opposite direction of Earth’s. When one of these CMEs reaches our planet, it can cause a geomagnetic storm, ripping away part of Earth’s own magnetic field in the atmosphere and rearranging it. These violent storms can last for days, and result in the beautiful sight of the Northern or Southern Lights (auroras), but can also damage several critical technological systems, including GPS, other satellites, airline radio communications and yes, electrical power grids on the ground. As it turns out, the Sun is expected to enter its period of increased activity this year, though so far, it's been a relatively quiet one. Image of aurora borealis over the Midwest US (credit: NASA).   ""Who uses space weather? Almost everyone."" The space weather prediction center at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association (NOAA) is in charge of forecasting the intensity of these events, using a scale from G1 to G5 (higher is worse), and warning all of the industries that might be affected.  ""The fact is, we’re almost at a point where if you ask the question ‘who uses space weather services,’ my answer is almost everyone,"" said William Murtagh, program coordinator for NOAA’s space prediction weather center, also a coauthor of the new report. Murtagh pointed out that even the pipeline industry was at risk of being affected by solar events because pipelines themselves are electrically conductive. Murtagh’s job is to deliver space weather warnings, especially those of geomagnetic storms, to other industries in time for them to take action and avoid heavy damage. Because of that information, industries have managed to avoid damage to their systems from the lesser G1 to G4 storms that have occurred over the years. Murtagh said the success of this program explains why even when there are dire reports of solar flares and storms in the mainstream media, they often don't result in any perceivable damage to the public at large. ""After the event happens, the media says 'nothing happened. But with space weather, something's always happening."" When it comes to the G5, or ""great geomagnetic storms,"" it's unclear that information alone would be enough to mitigate their effects. As Murtagh told The Verge, ""We sometimes refer to them as ‘Space Weather Katrinas.’"" ""we sometimes refer to them as ‘Space Weather Katrinas.’"" In order to forecast these events well in advance and alert those affected to get out of the way or turn equipment off, space weather experts rely on a long list of specialized instruments on the ground and in the sky, all of which could suffer maintenance issues if their budgets are slashed, as the report notes. But two are of particular importance: the SOHO spacecraft run by NASA and ESA, which contains coronagraphs, instruments capable of imaging the area of the Sun where CMEs are born. The other is a NASA spacecraft called the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE), which is parked a million miles away from Earth in the direction of the Sun. ACE measures solar wind and can provide an hour’s notice of a CME hitting the Earth. The SOHO spacecraft before its launch in 1995. Credit: NASA/ESA SOHO. ""That’s our warning buoy,"" Bonadonna said of the ACE spacecraft. ""That’s the fire alarm going off saying ‘get out of the house.’"" Meanwhile, ""if we were to lose that SOHO spacecraft, we lose that ability to forecast geomagnetic storms,"" Murtagh said. But while both spacecraft have been extremely reliable so far, they were launched in the mid- to late-1990s, and could give out at any time. A replacement spacecraft for ACE called DISCOVR is due to launch in 2014, and while several other craft have already been launched to succeed SOHO, none can provide its full capabilities. ""That’s the fire alarm going off."" Meanwhile, studies have found that while massive geomagnetic storms are rare, they are a real and imminent risk, with as much as a 12 percent chance of one occurring in the next decade, according to some studies. The most recent geomagnetic storm to cause any significant damage to the Earth occurred in 1989, when one knocked out power for nearly the entire province of Quebec, Canada, plunging six million people into darkness for nine hours. For power grids, the danger comes from surges that can overload and permanently damage their equipment. It’s this risk that space weather experts are most worried about. As the new White House-commissioned report notes, potential ""consequences on the nation’s power grid are even higher [than other industries], with potential costs of $1-2 trillion that could take up to a decade to completely repair."" Map of power outages in worst-case scenario of geomagnetic storm. Credit: ""Too Important to Fail"", Space Weather, 3, 2005/White House OSTP.   ""The power distribution industry runs on a very fine line now,"" Bonadonna told The Verge. ""They need to watch it [solar activity] very closely and make sure it doesn’t become a problem. But they have done a very good job in the last several years of making improvements."" Such improvements include systems to harden power grids and make them more resilient against power surges, and to identify which areas are more at risk. As it turns out, not all areas of the world are equally affected by a geomagnetic storm: power stations closer to the poles are at greater risk, as are those located in areas where the surrounding ground minerals are more electrically conductive. ""the consequences would be catastrophic to the nation."" There are two main camps when it comes to how big of risks a geomagnetic storm would pose to power companies . The worst-case scenario was first solidified in a 2008 report funded by NASA. It found that 365 high-voltage transformers out of a total 2,100 could be at risk if the most severe type of geomagnetic storm were to occur. ""The conclusion was that the consequences would be catastrophic to the nation,"" Murtagh said. ""There could be power outages extending from New England, down the mid-Atlantic coast, over to Chicago, affecting tens of millions, with recovery measured in months and years."" Murtagh said that this 2008 report caught the attention of the White House and lawmakers in Congress, who called for the new report to be drafted. But a 2011 report from the North American electrical grid industry organization NERC did not agree that there were this many transformers at risk during a massive geomagnetic storm. There may be some attempt to reconcile the difference in opinion soon, at an electrical grid security summit set for May 20th in Washington, DC. Still, whatever happens, there’s no telling when the next nightmare scenario might strike. It might be a G5 storm on the order of 1989 Quebec, or it might be worse: In 1859, the ""Carrington event"" was a geomagnetic storm so powerful it caused auroras as far south as Cuba and overloaded the dominant communications system of the time, the telegraph, shocking operators, sending sparks flying and even lighting some small fires. Fast forward 154 years, and the effects of a similarly sized solar storm would be far worse, say Murtagh and Bonadonna. ""If you lose dozens of transformers or more and are dealing without power for months or even a year, that’s a totally different challenge to society, to survive an outage like that,"" Murtagh said.",0.5081732799427661,0.49182672005723393,0.8347671137376876,1582,5.0082174462705433,729,6.2976680384087791,0,0,"Policy & Law, Science, Report",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

In a study published Wednesday in the Journal of Visualized Experiments (JoVE), Dr. Vitaly Vodyanoy of Auburn University demonstrates how certain bacteria-killing viruses could be used to identify resistant superbugs, potentially providing a much faster way to treat patients and disinfect hospitals. Vodyanoy's approach specifically targets drug-resistant Staphylococcus, or ""staph"" — a pathogen known that typically results in skin irritation. These conditions are usually cured with antibiotics, but stronger staph strains can become deadly upon infecting internal organs or patients with weakened immune systems. In his study, funded through a collaboration with the US Air Force, Dr. Vodyanoy showed that bacteria-killing bacteriophages can be used in conjunction with certain other antibodies to identify antibiotic resistance in staph samples. These bacteriophages change color when applied to drug-resistant samples, providing results in far less time than traditional tests. Minutes, not hours   ""In our method, we can determine bacterial antibiotic resistance in 10-12 minutes, while other methods take hours,"" Vodyanoy said in a statement released today. Whereas current tests involve complicated purification techniques, Vodyanoy's method could be as simple as a saliva swab. ""We envision a future where clinicians do tests with real blood or saliva samples,"" the researcher explains. ""The virus is completely benign to humans, and we hope to use it to make antimicrobial surfaces and glassware that kill the bacteria."" Vodyanoy's research comes at a critical time for medical researchers and clinicians, who continue to battle a surge in drug-resistant infections. In the US, superbugs are believed to claim more lives than the AIDS virus, with the bacterium MRSA annually accounting for 19,000 deaths alone. Vodyanoy's technique may streamline the identification of these superbugs — thereby stemming their spread — but actually treating them will require an acceleration in the development of new drugs. In a report published last month, the Infectious Diseases Society of America warned that pharmaceutical companies aren't developing enough antibiotics to meet this challenge, noting that the drug pipeline is ""on life support.""",0.5713727673669886,0.4286272326330114,0.8438232010537153,371,5.822102425876011,246,6.654471544715447,0,0,Science,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Harrington writes that many of his coworkers found their orders questionable, from selecting people for enhanced screenings based on their nationality to the broad use of full-body scanners. Harrington also writes that he hated that the job made him pat down children and the elderly and confiscate everything from nail clippers to homemade jellies under the guise of national security.

Harrington writes that those tasked with analyzing images from full-body scanners often didn't pay attention or would crack jokes about passengers' bodies.

In a statement to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), US ambassador Robert Mikulak accused Syria of delaying the process for unwarranted reasons, suggesting that the government is stalling as a ploy to gain leverage in negotiations. An agreement reached last year requires Syria to remove and destroy its entire chemical arsenal by June 30th. The country was supposed to destroy its most dangerous Priority One chemicals by December 31st, and remove its entire stockpile from the country by February 5th. According to the US, however, just 4 percent of Priority One chemicals have been destroyed so far, and the country is likely to miss the February deadline, as well. The OPCW is overseeing the process, which was enacted under an agreement that narrowly avoided a US military strike against the Assad regime.   ""This is not rocket science. They're dragging their feet."" In a statement to the OPCW on Thursday, Mikulak said that ""the effort to remove chemical agent and key precursor chemicals from Syria has seriously languished and stalled."" He added that Assad's ""open-ended delaying of the removal operation could ultimately jeopardize the carefully timed and coordinated multistate removal and destruction effort."" The Syrian government, still engaged in a nearly three-year civil war with rebel groups, has blamed the delay on security concerns, saying it needs more equipment to ensure the chemicals' safe transfer out of the country. But Mikulak told the OPCW that Assad's demands ""are without merit and display a ‘bargaining mentality’ rather than a security mentality."" The Syrian government and opposition groups are holding peace negotiations in Geneva this week, though progress has been slow. ""This is not rocket science,"" Jen Psaki, a State Department spokeswoman, told the New York Times. ""They're dragging their feet."" Mikulak also criticized Syria for deactivating 12 chemical production facilities, rather than destroying them, as stipulated in the agreement. The facilities, housed in airport hangers and underground areas, are currently ""inactivated,"" but Mikulak said these measures could be ""readily reversible within days."" ""The timeline originally agreed upon was terribly optimistic."" Syria began destroying its chemical weapons arsenal in October, drawing swift praise from US Secretary of State John Kerry. So far, only two shipments have been removed from the country. They will be loaded aboard a US cargo ship and destroyed in international waters. The US appears to be growing impatient with Assad's delays, though experts say that considering the deadly circumstances of Syria's civil war, setbacks are hardly a surprise.

That recommendation was based on estimates that there would be no change to the rate in which oil sands development or crude oil refinery occurred. The State Department says it's since taken into account 1.5 million comments on the draft, and has expanded its analysis on climate change, the chance of spills, economics, and the possibility of using rail transport instead. The project would build a 1,179 mile long pipeline from Alberta, Canada to Nebraska in the US, a system designed to funnel some 830,000 barrels of oil from north to south each day. That pipeline would link up to an existing section of US pipeline developed to deliver the crude to refineries in the Gulf Coast. The multi-billion dollar proposal was immediately met with reservation from environmental groups, who worried about potential global warming effects from extracting the oil, as well as disruptions to local wildlife.

The US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is taking its first steps today to modernize that system with a new order that calls for companies like AT&T and Verizon to submit proposals for how to provide telephone service of the future using IP — the protocol that's used to transmit data on the internet. With those proposals, the FCC will allow companies to engage in experimental IP phone service that addresses the numerous different requirements that such a system needs to pass before replacing the country's universal wireline phone network. Companies like AT&T and Verizon have pushed the FCC to let them drop support for costly and outdated copper phone service, and each has proposed its own plans as to how coaxial, fiber, and wireless networks could fill the gap. But there are lots of questions to be answered. Plans like AT&T's only cover 99 percent of customers, and the FCC has little interest in leaving citizens in rural America without phone service in the wake of a changeover from copper. The tests will also help make sure that 911 service is available at all times, and that devices like home alarms and medical devices can continue to work. Perhaps more importantly, companies have to figure out how to transition the US' huge database of phone numbers over to an IP-based system.

The award was the final decision in a court battle with Karbon Arms, Taser’s last standing competitor in the industry focused on selling electroshock weapons to police. Taser claims to supply electroshock guns — the stunners known as Tasers in the same way that tissues are known as Kleenexes — to about 16,500 of the 19,000 police departments in the US. So it’s surprising that Taser even had a competitor, let alone one it needed to stand off against in court. As it turns out, this battle has been ongoing in various forms for a decade. The judge’s award earlier this month was a debilitating blast to an already maimed Karbon Arms — and it ended up being a kill-shot. As of this month, Karbon is officially ""closed for business."" But questions remain about the man behind Taser’s last competitor. Who would be audacious enough to fight for a decade against a company with 90 percent market share in its industry? And after a standoff with the mighty Taser International, what could possibly come next for the entrepreneur? The man behind Karbon is Robert Gruder, a Tampa, Florida businessman whose history is as far removed from electroshock weapons as anyone could expect. He was never a cop. He’s not an electrical engineer. In fact, his background is in finance. And his first company, GEM Technologies, was conceived in 1990 to translate back-end code for corporate IT systems. That ""morphed into"" Alydaar Software Corp., then morphed again into one of the most high-profile companies proselytizing for Y2K computer-system protections. But as Y2K approached, Gruder realized Alydaar was a one-trick pony. ""Y2K was the only business I’m aware of where you knew exactly when your final deadline was going to be,"" Gruder says. So he decided to rebrand as the Information Architects Corp. It produced Jitzu — a predecessor to MySpace or Facebook, Gruder says, that cost $49.95 and failed almost immediately. ""It was a little too visionary for its time,"" according to Gruder. Gruder wasn’t discouraged, though. He had another market in mind. ""I knew,"" he told The Verge, ""I could build a better Taser."" Image credit: Chuck Burton / AP It’s understandable that someone like Gruder — with his keen eye for emerging tech markets — would have seen Taser International as a potential target in 2002. While Taser has a huge market share today and recently expanded into body-worn police cameras, its only products in 2002 were variations on its flagship device, the electroshock gun. That fact, Gruder says, made them vulnerable. ""I’m an opportunist,"" Gruder says. ""It was a large market just like Y2K was, and it seemed like a good space to get into."" Gruder’s first attempt at a Taser competitor was called Stinger Systems. He brought on investors and began the process of taking the company public. By late 2004, he announced that his new electroshock gun was in production and ready for sale. He also said it had been approved as a non-firearm by the US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF). That last point was a huge deal, because it meant his weapon wouldn’t be regulated in the same way as a gun. That regulatory snare kept Taser stagnant for years in the mid 1990s before the company started booming around 1998. If Stinger had a serious electroshock weapon that wasn’t a firearm, it could compete with Taser. Unfortunately for Gruder, Taser did not take his competition lightly. ""Taser doesn't make very good products."" In late 2004, Taser filed a trademark infringement lawsuit. And things never really picked up for Stinger after that. It took about three years for Taser to prevail in that copyright case, and in that time, Taser also hit Stinger with a patent lawsuit. What’s more, the US Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a complaint alleging that Gruder had lied to potential investors about production levels, readiness for sale, and approval by ATF. The National Institute of Justice also released a report panning Stinger’s main electroshock gun, stating that the Stinger was less reliable, less accurate, and less durable than Taser’s X26. The SEC complaint was eventually dismissed, and the NIJ study acknowledges that the Stinger weapon tested was a prototype not cleared for sale, but that didn’t matter; the bad press, combined with the lawsuits, was enough to send Stinger into its death throes. By 2010, Stinger was out of money and in debt, and it had lost its court battles with Taser. So it had little choice but to go out of business. By that time, Gruder tells The Verge, he had become more than aware of complaints about Taser’s shock weapons. There were (and still are) plenty to choose from. A simple Google News search for ""Taser,"" for example, will show some weird news and Taser press, but also a multitude of controversies over the company’s electroshock guns being deployed by police officers. Those deployments have led to lawsuits, public battles, and Taser-related deaths now estimated to be well over 800. In tandem, Gruder says, these problems showed that Taser’s technology was still overdue for innovation through competition. ""Taser doesn't make very good products,"" Gruder bluntly told The Verge. ""They’re not very innovative.""    So Gruder made a move similar to his move with Alydaar years ago: he used the patent loss as an opportunity to rebrand and try again. Then he shrewdly purchased his own dying company’s patents from himself, and began working with experts and designers to build a better version of Stinger’s weapon. Gruder set his sights on making a weapon that was just as good as Taser’s X26 at incapacitating a human being, but less likely to cause fatalities. ""There was no list of the dead for Karbon."" Pointing to a study by scientists at the University of Wisconsin’s Department of Biomedical Engineering, Gruder claims he achieved that goal. That study shows Karbon’s main weapon fires triple the number of electronic pulses per microsecond than Taser’s X26, with a less severe shock per pulse. Gruder says that’s why ""there was no list of the dead for Karbon."" A less severe shock certainly sounds safer. But it’s difficult to say that Karbon’s weapons solved the electroshock fatality problem. Karbon wasn’t a public company and didn’t release sales figures, though Gruder estimates Karbon had overall sales of $1.5 million in 2013. Still, that figure is dwarfed by Taser, which boasted $123.5 million in revenue last year alone. Taser’s electroshock guns have been deployed exponentially more than Karbon’s, in other words, skewing any comparisons on fatality tolls. But if Karbon wasn’t going to solve the fatality problem, no one else was going to either. Other Taser competitors over the years have come and gone. One company, Law Enforcement Associates, joined the electroshock competition around the time Stinger made its first forays into the market. That company now sticks to surveillance and lighting systems. There’s also Phazzer — a blatant Taser knockoff — but the fact that Taser hasn’t mentioned this particular competitor in SEC documents indicates the company doesn’t see it as a pressing concern. ""Taser will continue with their monopoly."" In any case, it’s unlikely Gruder or Karbon will see their weapons further tested on the public because Taser has relentlessly attacked Karbon in court, just as it relentlessly attacked Stinger. Taser filed a patent lawsuit in Arizona almost immediately after Karbon went to market with its new product. Then it filed another lawsuit in Delaware. While Karbon prevailed in the Arizona lawsuit, the $2.4 million award against Karbon this year was too much to bear. ""Needless to say, they had a bigger bankroll than us,"" Gruder says. ""They sued us out of business. So they’ll continue with their monopoly."" Taser International’s press liaison declined to comment about its patent battle with Karbon beyond what the company offered in a press release. But Polk Wagner, a professor of intellectual property law and policy at Stanford University, says that Taser’s lawsuits against Karbon and Stinger tell a classic story about innovation: Taser invented a new technology, and it’s going to do whatever it can to protect it. ""That story only works,"" Polk continues, ""if you think the patent system is working well."" Not that it necessarily is. ""Maybe it’s allowing companies like Taser to protect an edge in the marketplace,"" he adds. ""That’s not necessarily a technological edge but merely an edge by virtue of being in the market longer."" According to Gruder, Taser’s legal dominance comes down to that, a wealth of cash, and a willingness to bully competitors. ""That story only works if you think the patent system is working."" Already, though, the man who fought Taser and lost has moved on to new things. He’s now hoping to get investors — through a not-yet-launched Kickstarter campaign — for VidaPak, a take on the wildly popular K-cup coffee-making system designed for cold drinks. It’s a far cry from incapacitating bad guys with electroshock weapons. But it seems appropriate that Gruder would jump right into a new entrepreneurial venture. The man, it seems, is perpetually undiscouraged. ""Everybody likes coffee like I do, so I think this is really going to be big,"" he says. Then, laughing: ""Let's just hope Taser doesn't get into single-serving beverages.""",0.4443568800365994,0.5556431199634007,0.6438619555509775,1576,5.1123096446700504,754,6.4244031830238724,0,0,"Policy & Law, US & World, Report",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

Durov sold his remaining stake in VK earlier this week. (Hubert Burda Media / Flickr) It's hard to imagine a situation in which Mark Zuckerberg would sell his stake in Facebook. It's even more difficult to imagine him fleeing from the police, battling takeover attempts from billionaires, or tossing $100 bills from his office window. Yet that's exactly the scenario that's unfolded over the past few months in St. Petersburg, where Pavel Durov, the eccentric founder of social networking site VKontakte (VK), is suddenly persona non grata. Durov, 29, sold his remaining stake in VK this week, officially ending his tenure at the helm of Russia's most popular social network and turning the page on more than two years of turmoil and political strife. Durov's departure effectively transfers majority control of VK to business magnate Alisher Usmanov — Russia's richest man, with an estimated worth of $20.2 billion, and a close ally of President Vladimir Putin. Durov sold his 12 percent stake to Ivan Tavrin, chief executive of telecom provider MegaFon, which Usmanov controls. (The exact sum of the sale was not disclosed, though it is believed to be between $300 and $400 million.) That means that Usmanov and his Kremlin-friendly allies now control 52 percent of the company, raising concerns over the future of VK and the freedom of its users. Under Durov, VK became Russia's most popular social network and second-most visited site overall. The network saw nearly 50 million unique daily visitors as of July, 2013, compared to just 7.8 million for Facebook, according to ComScore's data on Russian social media use. Over time, VK became known for its permissive attitude toward digital piracy — something that no doubt boosted its popularity among younger users — and for its similarly liberal approach to free speech. The reason, experts say, is because Durov was at the helm. ""They will not protect users' information as strongly as Durov did."" ""When Durov became CEO, VK was independent,"" says Nickolay Kononov, editor-in-chief of Russian business news site Hopes & Fears and author of a bestselling book on VK. ""He was the only person who made decisions about everything — about product, about marketing, about strategy. And especially in some questions of security and connection with the state, with the Kremlin."" Shifting power to Usmanov could change that. In 2011, the oligarch fired two senior managers for publishing anti-Putin photos in an online newspaper that he owns. ""The new management, I think, will be more flexible,"" Kononov says. ""They will not protect users' information as strongly as Durov did."" A staunch libertarian and devoted fan of The Matrix, Durov is seen as a hero in Russian startup circles, despite being something of a media recluse. He rarely gives interviews, and hardly ever looks at the camera when being photographed, but when he does appear in public, controversy usually follows. In 2012, he was seen tossing paper airplanes made from 5,000-ruble (about $140) notes from the window of VK's St. Petersburg offices, and was reportedly laughing at the people scrambling to pick them up from the street. Last year, Durov offered to hire former NSA contractor Edward Snowden just hours after he was granted asylum in Russia, criticizing the US for ""betraying the principles it was once built on."" His deep-seated contrarianism and libertarian beliefs won him supporters among certain groups, though it ultimately led to his downfall. When anti-Putin protests broke out in 2011 amid allegations of election-fixing, Russian authorities asked Durov to shut down VK pages operated by activists. Durov refused, and responded by posting a picture of a dog wearing a sweatshirt to his Twitter page — a characteristically defiant poke at the intelligence officers who sent the request. In an open letter, he explained that the decision was motivated by business rather than politics, insisting that he was neither pro- nor anti-Putin, though the episode marked a turning point for VK. Rattled by the protests, the Kremlin began taking a greater interest in social media, beginning with VK.  Alisher Usmanov, Russia's richest man, now has majority control over VK. (Gulustan / Wikimedia Commons) Slowly but surely, Durov lost control over his company through nebulous back-room deals and a bizarre run-in with the law. In April of last year, police raided Durov's home and offices after accusing him of driving a white Mercedes over the foot of a traffic cop. Durov denied any involvement and by the time police arrived at his doorstep, he had already fled the country. For months, no one knew where he was or what he was doing, and he remained in hiding after the charges against him were dramatically downgraded in June. Just days after the raid came an even bigger blow: two VK co-founders had decided to sell their 48 percent combined stake to United Capital Partners (UCP), an investment firm managed by purported Putin ally Ilya Sherbovich. The deal took many by surprise, including Durov, who only heard about it when a reporter reached out for comment. Sherbovich insisted that the sale was completed without pressure or interference from the government, though Kononov, in an investigative piece published last year, reported that it was orchestrated by Igor Sechin — head of the state-owned oil giant Rosneft, and one of Putin's closest allies. (Sherbovich sits on the board of Rosneft.) ""The goal was to put VK under the control of businessmen who are friendly to the Kremlin."" Durov didn't lose complete control after the sale; he had earlier secured voting rights on the 40 percent share owned by the internet giant Mail.ru, which, combined with his personal stake, gave him a 52 percent share. But internal tensions began bubbling, as UCP urged Durov to focus on monetizing the site through more advertising, and Mail.ru — which is partially owned by Usmanov — began pushing for a larger stake. Financial concerns, however, were nothing more than a pretext for pursuing larger political goals. ""All these claims about monetization, it's not the main problem with VK,"" Kononov says. ""The goal of this deal was to put VK under the control of businessmen who are friendly to the Kremlin."" For other Russian startups, that may send a dangerous signal. ""It essentially means that there's a glass ceiling to how big you can grow your company, and how influential your company can be in the Russian internet space before the government begins to take interest in it,"" says Samuel Greene, director of the Russia Institute at King's College London. ""And I think the likelihood is that it will have a chilling effect on entrepreneurs."" Ultimately, Kononov says, Durov became fed up, and decided to ""go global."" He resurfaced to the public late last year to promote Telegram — a WhatsApp-like mobile messaging service — and plans to launch new products down the road. (Kononov says he's particularly interested in ephemeral messaging apps like Snapchat.) Although he's technically still the CEO of VK and insists that he'll retain influence over the site, it's expected that he'll step away for good. In a post published to his VK page this week, Durov, true to his enigmatic form, managed to sound both weary and sarcastic. ""What you own sooner or later gets to own you."" ""What you own sooner or later gets to own you,"" he wrote. ""In the past few years, I actively rid myself of property, giving away and selling all I had, from furniture and things to real estate and companies. To achieve the ideal I had to get rid of the biggest piece of property I owned, the 12 percent stake in VKontakte. I am happy to have recently achieved this goal, too, having sold the stake to my friend Ivan Tavrin."" For VK, the future remains muddier than ever. It's unlikely that its new pro-Kremlin owners will implement drastic changes, but their very presence could be cause for concern for activists or opposition members. The idea, Greene suggests, is to simply make sure that the government is ""in a position to control things if and when something happens."" The timing of the announcement is curious, as well. Kononov thinks the Kremlin wanted to secure the sale of Durov's stake prior to next week's Winter Olympics, which has been marred by terrorist threats and security concerns. Securing Putin-friendly leaders at the top of VK could make it easier for the government to monitor the site for terrorist activity, though it's impossible to say whether Sochi factored into the announcement at all. ""I think the only way you can judge that is to get inside the heads of people at the Kremlin,"" Greene says. ""And that's not a comfortable place to be.""",0.635374766323597,0.364625233676403,0.8571664698937426,1481,5.0121539500337606,782,6.296675191815857,0,0,"Policy & Law, US & World, Web, Report",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

The new version is called Pro Tools First, and when it ships sometime in the next couple of months, it will give musicians a way to use Avid's software without subscribing to any services or having to buy any hardware. It's a different approach from what Avid was doing with Pro Tools Express, a similarly feature-limited version of its software that was bundled with its Mbox hardware. It's a small sample of features The free price tag gets you a considerably more limited set of features than you'd get in Express, including a maximum of four track inputs instead of eight, and support for just three projects. It's got the same limit of 16 MIDI tracks that Express has, as opposed to the full version's 512 tracks. You also can't export your projects as an MP3, or to iTunes and Soundcloud (there's a full chart of what you can and can't do here). In that regard, Avid's designed First to let you spend money to add features, though not quite like buying the full version (which starts at $899). Instead, it's more like a freemium app, with Avid's App Store selling bundles and plug-ins, as well as storage for extra projects that get synced to the cloud. It's unclear just how far Avid plans to take that, but it's quite clear that the general idea is to push you towards getting the full version of Pro Tools once you've outgrown this one's limits. Avid says Pro Tools First will arrive as a free download sometime in the first quarter of this year. The company also announced a $29.99 per month license for the full version of Pro Tools 12, as well as a shared production feature for Pro Tools projects in the cloud.",0.598993591502965,0.40100640849703495,0.18366810276991496,324,4.5740740740740744,186,5.344086021505376,0,0,"Entertainment, Tech",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Dude, that is a really great headline for my first Sundance Gurnal entry. It's also a question I had more times than I expected to ask myself yesterday, the day of my journey to Park City. The day started out promisingly: having spent the prior 24 hours dealing with a violent bout of food poisoning contracted at a trendy, overpriced Brooklyn eatery that shall not be named, I rolled out of bed at 5AM and scrambled to last-minute pack for my cinematic mountain retreat. (My first real adventure upon arrival at Sundance: opening my suitcase and finding out what I decided to pack in that particular delirium. I did not disappoint: there are absolutely no t-shirts or scarves, but the bottom of my tote bag is full of loose, lint-covered Emergen-C packets.) Still, I was doing better than I had expected the night before, watching Empire on Hulu in bed in a sweaty daze and wondering if I'd have to miss my first couple days of the festival. I was mad! My first Sundance, sabotaged by the [redacted] pork at [redacted] on [redacted] Avenue! Sundance — a storied, possibly wildly oversold media clusterfuck where I would actually kind of know what I was doing, missed because we just haaad to see what the fuss was about the [redacted] dumplings. what if the movies are, I dunno, not good? Anyway, that's what was going through my mind as I dragged myself to JFK that morning: ""Why am I going to Sundance?"" Again as I waited in security as my anti-nausea medication started to take its sedative effect: ""Why am I going to Sundance?"" Again as my flight to Phoenix was delayed for two hours: ""Why am I going to Sundance?"" Again as I tried to have two simultaneous conversations with equally unhelpful US Airways phone and desk agents: ""Why am I going to Sundance?"" And again as my flight was cancelled, and I waited another six hours: ""Why am I going to Sundance?"" Even as I finally made my way out of Salt Lake City up into the mountains, the absurdity of this event, even aside from my gastrointestinal well-being, began to dawn on me. Here I am, one of thousands taking this long day's journey into a moonlit, snow-capped summit in Utah, mostly to sit inside a series of dark rooms for a week and watch some stories. People grouse about paying for movie tickets and parking when they could just watch something on Netflix; how much is actually at Sundance that makes this trip so perennially worth it? Like, what if the movies are, I dunno, not good? Does that even matter anymore? I've heard people with more experience than me say that this is both a more indie and more mainstream Sundance program than usual. There certainly appear to be a lot of films about white people having relationship problems, and at least one post-apocalyptic love triangle blockbuster. There's gonna be some Oculus happening somewhere, somehow. There are going to be a lot of female directors and writers and cinematographers, telling a wildly varied array of stories that offer some small hope that ""women's picture"" will no longer be considered a thematic genre. There's gonna be some Oculus happening somewhere, somehow Ultimately, there's not one particular thing I'm looking forward to at my first Sundance, and I feel pretty excited about that. And that's also why The Verge is at Sundance: this festival, along with a handful of major international festivals throughout the year, is one of the few chances we have to see movies with close to no interference. By the time the chosen ones of Sundance, Cannes, or Venice make their way to your local Cool Theatre, there will already be a storyline around them, molding your expectations. ""The third act comes out of nowhere."" ""There's no way so-and-so doesn't get an Oscar nod this year."" ""I bet you so-and-so ends up helming Ant-Man IV."" In an era in which a film occupies your awareness over months of marketing and buildup and two hours of inevitable letdown, it's exciting to just plop yourself down in a theatre with little more than a title, a director, and a logline to go on. And yeah, there are parties and celebrities and altitude sickness, among other barriers between the festival-goer and the film. I'll try to take it all in as much as possible, but I have to be careful. Last time I did that it was innocently perusing the menu at [redacted] in Park Slope, and we all know how that turned out. Stuff I'm looking forward to this week:   That's it for now! Now if you'll excuse me — gotta go shop for a scarf and write a very angry Yelp review.

Around a year ago, Jason Kilar and Rich Tom abandoned their positions as Hulu's CEO and chief technical officer to begin building Vessel with the goal of harnessing the financial power of viral video stars. Videos posted to Vessel will only be exclusive for three days For $2.99 a month, Vessel users can watch advance episodes of web shows from stars like fashion blogger Ingrid Nilsen and parody comic Shane Dawson. Videos posted to Vessel won't be available anywhere else for 72 hours — a time slot the creators can extend if they want to. The service began courting content from video creators last month, with plans to launch publicly once their content was flush enough to warrant a fee. In addition to the subscription service, Vessel will let users watch videos from sites like CollegeHumor and Funny Or Die for free. YouTube, where most of these shows are currently hosted, takes a 45 percent cut of the advertising revenue generated by its users. Vessel, on the other hand, is offering creators 70 percent of all ad revenue and 60 percent of subscription revenue. YouTube, unsurprisingly, is worried about Vessel swiping its creators, and has moved quickly to sign new deals with its big stars as well as offer bonuses, The Wall Street Journal reports. These YouTube stars won't appeal to everyone — many people won't even know who they are — but their fanbases are formidable. Nilsen and Dawson both have several million subscribers, and PewDiePie, YouTube's most popular content creator, has nearly 34 million. Last month, Kilar called Vessel ""a missing piece in the ecosystem,"" claiming fans will be willing to pay to see videos before anyone else can. PewDiePie might not appeal to you It remains to be seen whether Vessel's relatively small three-day exclusivity window will be enough to entice fans to pay, when they can always wait the length of a long weekend and watch the videos for free. There is also currently no system in place to prevent users from ripping Vessel videos and posting them to free sites — for now, the company is betting on the morality of its largely teenage target audience.

Google's focus with the new effort is simplicity and bills that aren't confusing. It's an approach not unlike the one John Legere's T-Mobile has tried to lead with its Uncarrier effort. But how does Google's plan compare to what you'd get from the biggest players in wireless right now? Let's take a look. For $20 a month, Google gives you unlimited domestic voice calling and texts, unlimited international texts, coverage in over 120 countries, and support for Wi-Fi tethering. It's all centered around a hybrid take on wireless coverage that's new to most consumers; Project Fi claims to seamlessly hand off between Wi-Fi and the mobile networks of T-Mobile and Sprint in the United States, though we can't yet say how reliably it works. A coverage map is here. And then comes the data. Project Fi's plans are cheaper than any major carrier Google sells monthly data at a price of $10 per gigabyte: $10 for 1GB, $20 for 2GB, $30 for 3GB, $50 for 5GB, and so on. But the innovative part of Project Fi revolves around the data you don't end up using. If you fail to burn through all the data you've paid for in a month, Google will automatically ""refund"" you for the unused portion as a credit on your next bill. ""For example, if your data budget is 3GB and you use 2.2GB, you'll get $8 (for 800MB of unused data) to use next month to lower your bill,"" Google says. But the company is also taking a refreshing approach to overages. Whereas carriers like Verizon and AT&T hit subscribers with stiff fees for going over their data limit — even by a small amount — here again Google will only charge you for what you use. Go over what you've paid for by 500MB, for example, and Google will only ask for an extra $5. There's no harsh penalty for using more data when you need it. But you've got to buy a Nexus 6 to sign up But there are limits to what Project Fi can give you. Mainly, there's no such thing as a family plan and data cannot be shared between users. Everyone must have their own individual Fi plan. With that in mind, we'll limit the following comparisons to individual plans offered by the big four carriers in the United States. Read next: How does Google Fi's coverage compare? Most importantly, Project Fi currently supports just one phone: the Nexus 6. You can't use an iPhone with it, nor Samsung's new Galaxy S6. Google's phablet starts at $649, runs the stock version of Android 5.0, and is quick to receive new software updates. But its size can prove unwieldy, and battery life along with camera performance can't compete with some more recent Android flagships. Thankfully, conversations can be carried across any and all devices that support Google Hangouts, so you won't always need the Nexus at your side. When looking at single-line plans, Verizon's cheapest option is a 1GB package with unlimited voice and unlimited text priced at $60 per month with a traditional contract, or $45 monthly if you sign onto Edge installment plan when buying a smartphone. 2GB is $75 ($60 with Edge), but if you need more data you'll need to switch to Verizon's More Everything plans, which are generally suited better for customers with multiple phone lines. A single line and 3GB of data will cost you $90 ($75 with Edge), while 4GB will cost you $100 ($85). Note that these prices include the access fee that Verizon charges to operate a smartphone on your line. Project Fi does not charge Nexus 6 owners any overage fees.   Fi's hybrid network could still fall short of Verizon's vast coverage For those same data tiers, Project Fi would cost $30, $40, $50, and $60, respectively. And remember that you're credited for unused data. Verizon Wireless currently does not offer any sort of rollover data plan as T-Mobile and AT&T do. If you don't use the data you've paid for, it's gone. And for most plans, Verizon will charge an overage of $15 once you've exceeded your plans data. That applies for every extra gigabyte, and is billed even if you go over your plan's data by even a small amount. Prepaid: Verizon offers two main plans for prepaid customers, and both include unlimited talk and text. The first, with 1GB of included data, is $45 per month. The other, with a higher 2.5GB ceiling, is $60. Additional data can be purchased for $10 per gigabyte. Verizon Wireless allows customers to choose from many smartphones, though prepaid options are more limited. The company's network offers wider coverage than either T-Mobile or Sprint and is frequently regarded as the best in the United States. You're definitely paying more to be on that network, though. Including its access fee on a single line, AT&T's comparable 1GB plan is priced at $65 per month. This drops to $50 if you are a month-to-month customer, bring your own smartphone, or purchase a device through AT&T Next. 3GB is $80 ($65), and moving up to 4GB hikes rates to $110 ($95). AT&T's Mobile Share Value plans offer rollover data, carrying unused data from your current month over to the next — but you must use it before that second billing period is up or you'll lose any remaining data from the original month. Project Fi does not preserve your unused data from one month to the next; instead, it automatically applies a credit for unused data to the following month's bill. AT&T charges overage penalties of $20 per 500MB if you're on the 1GB plan, or $15 per 1GB for all other plans. Overage data does not roll over. The company does not offer complimentary overseas coverage, but allows unlimited texting from the US to anywhere in the world as part of Mobile Share Value plans. Prepaid: AT&T's offers a prepaid plan with 1.5GB of data, unlimited talk and text, plus unlimited texting to Mexico and ""over 100"" countries. A more expensive $60 option includes 4GB of data and expands on international coverage with free unlimited calling to Mexico. Prepaid plans do not offer rollover data. AT&T allows customers to choose from many smartphones. The company's network offers wider coverage than either T-Mobile or Sprint. Sprint, a Project Fi partner, offers its own customers unlimited talk, text, and data plans for between $50 (if you pay full price for an iPhone) and $85 (new and existing customers who sign a two-year contract). Sprint's options do not include mobile hotspot functionality, something you get with Project Fi, Verizon, and AT&T. The carrier does support Wi-Fi calling, however, something its larger rivals don't. Sprint allows customers to choose from many smartphones. The company's cellular network is generally seen as inferior to its competitors. All of T-Mobile's data plans offer ""unlimited"" data, which is to say that after you exceed the high-speed data you've paid for in a month, you can still access the web at much slower, throttled speeds. T-Mobile's plan for 1GB of high-speed data, unlimited talk and text is $50 each month. Bumping up to 3GB of data is $60, 5GB is $70 (the same rate Google charges), and the carrier also offers a proper unlimited data plan for $80 per month. T-Mobile customers do not incur overage fees. T-Mobile's Uncarrier perks still make a compelling case T-Mobile's regular Simple Choice plans include Wi-Fi calling and ""Uncarrier"" features like Music Freedom, which doesn't count streaming from popular music services against your data usage. T-Mobile also offers free international service (with slower data speeds), likely in the same 120 countries that Google says it will extend coverage to. For those on 3GB or 5GB data plans, the company's Data Stash feature carries over unused data from one month to the next, and new customers on those plans are gifted 10GB of 4G LTE to start off with.   Project Fi does not offer perks resembling those from T-Mobile, nor can you purchase an unlimited plan through Google's new service. But for tiered data, Fi's prices are mostly lower; 1GB is $30 each month and 3GB is $50. T-Mobile is the only major US carrier to match Google's prices at any level, asking the same $70 that Project Fi does for 5GB of data. Prepaid: T-Mobile offers a 1GB prepaid plan for $40 per month, 3GB for $50 per month, and 5GB for $60 per month. Of note, you can also purchase a prepaid T-Mobile plan that includes 100 minutes of talk, unlimited texting, and up to 5GB of high-speed data for just $30 — but this option is available exclusively at Walmart stores and cannot be purchased from the carrier directly. T-Mobile allows customers to choose from many smartphones. Its network is viewed as strong in major cities, but tends to be weaker than Verizon and AT&T in suburban and rural areas. So that's how Project Fi lines up against the big four when it comes to pricing. You can find cheaper prepaid options with other MVNOs like Straight Talk, and startups like Republic Wireless offer service based on the idea Google is running with here. But most US wireless customers are aligned with one of the major players. You'll save money by going with Google (and sometimes earn some back), but you're also taking a huge gamble. We still have no idea how Google's mashup Wi-Fi / Sprint / T-Mobile network will fare in the real world, but we can't wait to try. Updated, 4/22/15, 7:45PM ET: Added more plan options for Verizon.

What should I get?”  This question, a real one my mom asked me a couple weeks ago, nearly made me launch into an hour-long conversation about wearables. I haven’t felt that way about a tech question since the iPhone first came out. In two short sentences, she expressed both the conventional wisdom about wearables and everything that’s complicated about it. Everybody expects smartwatches to take over the functions of stand-alone fitness trackers because we’ve seen this story before. Smartphones ate up MP3 players, point-and-shoot cameras, and Gameboys. If the Apple Watch is going to do the same kind of thing, we may as well get on board now.  Well, wait a minute. Actually, maybe wait a year or two.   I think stand-alone fitness trackers have a few good years left in them before smartwatches render them obsolete. I feel that way mainly because I’ve been using the Jawbone Up2 fitness tracker for about a week now. Before that, I’d been using Jawbone Up24 since Christmas — and the Up2 is basically a smaller, better version of it. Although there are a few things I don’t love about the Up2, on the whole there are benefits to it that aren’t easily dismissed, especially compared to a smartwatch. The Up2 is small — Jawbone says it’s 45 percent smaller than last year’s Up24, and I believe it. But more than raw size is the design: it has a more comfortable, more flexible strap and a better-looking module for the electronics. Like the Up24 before it, the Up2 was designed by Yves Behar to have an attractive aluminum casing. I like the crosshatch pattern, and I like that the three indicator lights are hidden underneath it, only lighting up when you need them. The design does a nice job of being attractive enough when you look at it, but nondescript enough that you don’t have to. The only real bad part is the clasp. It’s easy to adjust when you need to. But the thing you do more often is, you know, clasp it, and I find it’s fiddly and kind of annoying. I guess the best thing I can say is that it encourages me to leave the little thing on my wrist. The whole point of the Up2 is to quietly track your basic physical activity, a job it tackles without hassling you. It tracks steps, sure, but the real magic of the Up2 (and with any Jawbone fitness device) is the Up software on your phone. It’s great. It automatically figures out whether you’ve been sleeping or exercising and alerts you when you want it to so you can enter the relevant info on your workouts. You can program smart alarms that set the Up2 to vibrate when you’re coming out of a deep sleep. You can program in little ""get up and move around"" alerts. You can enter your meals in too, if you really want to track those. It’s a good thing the software on the phone is so good, because interacting with the Up2 itself is kind of pointless. You don’t need to, for one, since the software usually guesses whether you’re exercising or walking or sleeping on its own. For two, interacting with the Up2 requires you to use an unintuitive double-tap-and-hold-your-finger-down gesture to switch from active to sleeping modes. Like the clasp, it’s fussy, and after a day or two I stopped bothering with it. The best part about the hardware? The battery life. I’ve had it on for a week and haven’t charged it a single time. I’ve got about two more days left, according to the app. Among smartwatches, only the Pebble comes close to that, and it can’t do the kind of advanced fitness tracking the Up2 can. Unlike most smartwatches, you don’t have to think about charging it every night, and you can leave it on for sleep tracking. Unfortunately, the Up2 isn’t totally waterproof, just water-resistant. It’s fine for sweat or rain or the shower, of course, but to be honest I’m really shocked that Jawbone couldn’t make this more useful for swimmers. There’s no heart rate monitor, so there’s no good hardware reason beyond cost not to waterproof this thing. The charging contacts also theoretically shouldn’t preclude waterproofing. They’re external now, but you have to align it the right way for the magnets to catch. It’s a better system than the Up24’s plug, though, since there’s no more stupid charging cap to lose. But cost might be the most important part of the Up2: it starts at $99.99. That’s much cheaper than almost any smartwatch you can buy right now. It means you can get the benefits of a fitness tracker without committing yourself to a big investment or, honestly, learning how to use a whole new gadget. Truth be told, a hundred bucks seems high for the Up2. You’re paying for the quality, the design, and access to the software, and you’ll need to think about whether it all adds up to being worth it. For me, it does. But if you’re looking to spend less, getting a discounted Up24 might not be a terrible option. I’m a smartwatch guy — but then again I was a smartphone guy long before the iPhone was first announced. We all watched smartphones change the world, and a lot of people are hoping smartwatches can do it again. I’m not so sure, but luckily you don’t have to commit to a smartwatch just to get the benefits of a fitness tracker. Instead, you can spend much less and wait to see whether this watch thing is really ready for you (or vice versa). Hi mom! Here’s your answer: If you want basic activity and sleep tracking, get the Jawbone Up2.",0.47000553008011103,0.529994469919889,0.15288144282825286,972,4.6522633744855968,482,5.8838174273858925,0,12,"Tech, Review",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

""And Djay for iPad proved that obviously wrong.""  ""The whole interaction is done purely from your wrist."" It seems strange now to think of the iPad as something that you can only read on (even if its productivity tools are still limited). But it seems remarkably stranger to think that the same thing could happen with the Apple Watch: that one day, it'll be seen as a device that you can really get things done on. Algoriddim doesn't want to bet against it — in fact, it's hoping to build another app that can illustrate creative uses for a new Apple device. Read next: Read our Apple Watch review. To do that, it's today introducing a version of Djay for the Apple Watch. The app appears to be surprisingly capable, allowing you to pick and control two songs, synchronize them, fade between them, and even create basic loops and apply effects to them. That's a lot to fit on a small watch screen, but it looks like Djay could be an effective way to remotely mix as a DJ. ""iPhones are so powerful now that you can basically hook it up to a PA system at a club or a house party and just leave it alone,"" Karim Morsy, CEO of Algoriddim, tells The Verge. ""The processing is done on the phone, but the whole interaction is done purely from your wrist."" Morsy sees the Watch app as something that can allow pro DJs to step out from behind their booth for a while. It could also let a more casual user tweak their party's music while they're wandering around the house. You can't do everything remotely — there are a lot more features if you actually pick up the iPhone — but Morsy says that the essential tools for DJing are available through the Watch. The app will be free for a week We'll find out tomorrow how well that works in practice. Algoriddim has confidence that its app makes good use of the Watch, but it's worth remembering that the Apple Watch is a limited tool right now: it has some performance issues when it comes to apps, and it has some real limitations when it comes to battery life — you're not supposed to be interacting with this thing for every long, and DJing all night may take a toll. It could also just be uncomfortable. Still, if you're getting an Apple Watch and you're curious, there's not much reason not to try it out. Algoriddim is making Djay's iPhone app free to download starting today and running for a week. Djay's iPad app, which is also getting a small update today, will also be available for free. Simmons says the free downloads are meant to hook people, who could then go on to purchase Djay Pro or introduce the mobile apps to others. Algoriddim is also announcing a pair of updates for Djay's desktop app, Djay Pro. The first is support for Pioneer's CDJ and XDJ controllers, which Morsy believes will be a boon for its more professional users. The other update is video integration, bringing features from Algoriddim's iOS app Vjay into Djay Pro. It includes a number of visualizations and allows people to fade between them and other video footage to create visuals that play in sync with the music. It'll be available as a free update to existing Djay Pro owners.

After months of delays (that didn’t go unnoticed by customers), its latest flagship fitness tracker, the Up3, is finally shipping. It’s “the world’s most advanced tracker,” according to Jawbone’s marketing campaign. Put it next to the $99 Up2 or last year’s Up24, and the company will point out that the Up3 contains more sensors, and that those sensors have more advanced capabilities. From a technology perspective, sure, this $179 Up3 is the best device Jawbone has produced. But is that enough for it to stand up against a new wave of competition?  Companies big and small are trying to build the one true fitness companion that wraps around your wrist; on the high end, Jawbone is facing off against Microsoft Band and Apple Watch. On the low end, it’s got companies like Misfit eager to establish a spot. And then there’s longtime rival Fitbit, which recently rolled out its own updated lineup of health trackers. I’ve recently taken a greater interest in staying fit and maintaining some semblance of a healthy lifestyle, so the Up3 arrived at a pretty great time for me. I just wish it were a better product.   The Up3 features a design that’s not far off from the less-expensive Up2. It’s a bit larger and chunkier overall to accommodate for the added technology inside, but not noticeably so if you’re looking at the thing on someone’s wrist. Most of the Up3’s guts are located inside an aluminum casing that sits on the top of your wrist. The Up3 is splash-proof and safe for the shower, but you won’t want to submerge it. After originally promising that it would be fully waterproof (a requirement for swimmers), Jawbone realized during mass production that it couldn’t follow through and had to go back on its word. The downgrade is disappointing, but you can’t take Microsoft Band or the Apple Watch underwater, either. As it turns out, some of the Up3’s most important sensors are actually located on the inside of its strap. Look at the band’s underside and you’ll see a total of five gold-colored squares that make contact with your skin whenever it’s strapped on. These are what separate the Up3 from all the Ups that have come before it. They’re bioimpedance sensors that can measure your resting heart rate and make the Up3’s improved sleep-tracking features possible by monitoring your respiration rate, body temperature, and galvanic skin response. With these, the Up3 can track the stages of your sleep every night between light, deep, and REM. That’s something the Up2 won’t do. Instead, the less expensive model guesses your sleep patterns based on movement using its accelerometer. Unfortunately, the Up3 has the same poorly designed, awkward clasp as the Up2. Worse yet, it doesn’t even guarantee a secure fit; the Up3 has randomly come loose on a few occasions over the week I’ve been wearing it. It’s never happened while I was asleep, but it still makes me think there had to be a better, simpler way. If there's one plus, it's that you won't be taking it off frequently. The Up3's battery life is exceptional, and it'll last nearly a week on a single charge. A word of advice on style: go with the black one. Jawbone gave me a gray-and-silver model for review, and I never once received a compliment for its appearance. Like most other fitness bands, the black version won’t attract much attention. But this one? It screams, ""Oh, that’s one of those fitness things.""    The best thing about this product is Jawbone’s app on your smartphone. I came away impressed with its ability to automatically detect when I’d started working out or fallen asleep. Jawbone does give you the option to manually switch between activity and sleep-tracking modes, and you really should, since it’s the only way for the Up3 to figure out how long it takes for you to fall asleep. But to make that switch, you have to suffer through a pretty awful user experience. Your physical interactions with the Up3 (and Up2) are based around a bewildering system of taps. Tap twice to wake it up, and then hold to toggle between modes. That’d be simple enough if it worked reliably every time, but I regularly found myself tapping repeatedly to trigger the lights hidden beneath the Up3’s aluminum housing. Too often, it just didn’t register. Next time, they should really put a button on it. Jawbone has told me that the sensitivity around these controls might be fine-tuned in a coming firmware update. Back to the software: Jawbone’s Smart Coach system is pretty great. After picking a daily step goal (I’ve learned 10,000 takes some effort), you can set progress alerts so the band will vibrate every 3,000 steps or at another interval of your choosing. Smart Coach constantly keeps you updated on the previous day’s progress and how you stack up against the Jawbone community at large. I felt a decent sense of accomplishment after seeing that my daily step average ranks in the top 30 percent; sometimes it’s these and other little messages of encouragement that prove most effective. The system tracks your activity milestones (like hitting 50,000 steps) and pushes you to try a bit harder by entering into ""Today I Will"" challenges that go beyond your daily goal. I’m not someone who bothers with meal tracking or logging my weight. I’ve found ""don’t eat like an idiot or late at night"" is a sufficient strategy, and the process in Jawbone’s app always proves to be too much of a hassle. Thankfully Jawbone’s Up software lets you ignore both of these features entirely, and even better, it won’t pester you about them. I also liked the Smart Alarm option, which attempts to wake you during a light stage of sleep at any point between your target wake-up time and 30 minutes beforehand. And that brings us to the heart. Initially, I was pretty excited as Jawbone executives spoke about the Up3’s heart rate monitor. Whereas Apple, Microsoft, and most other fitness bands use LEDs and sophisticated algorithms to sample your blood flow and produce a best guess at your heart rate, Jawbone went with the sensors mentioned earlier. It’s a lot like putting your finger on a treadmill’s heart rate sensor; the Up3 ""measures the resistance of skin tissue to tiny electric currents,"" according to Jawbone. But is that more accurate than the path Fitbit, Microsoft, and Apple are pursuing? Well, it’s impossible to know. Right now, Up3 only measures your resting heart rate. And it only does that once a day. One time. Jawbone’s new flagship fitness tracker can’t tell you how hard you’re pushing your heart during a run or midway through your workout at the gym. It just won’t do it. I even opened up Apple’s Health app, hoping maybe it would pick up a reading as it does for my Polar chest strap: no dice. Measuring your heart rate during a workout is the key thing people expect when they see a fitness tracker has a monitor, and the Up3 just plain can’t do it. Jawbone’s reasoning for this approach is that your resting heart rate is a good gauge of your overall health. Every morning when you wake up, Smart Coach will reveal your reading for that day. And when it notices spikes or sudden changes, the app will do its best to figure out why. Often this is tied directly to sleep; if Jawbone detects you had a lousy night’s sleep or woke up multiple times, it’ll urge you to head to bed sooner and try for better rest. During my time with the Up3 so far, my resting heart rate has averaged between 54 and 58 beats per minute. That’s a bit below the wide range Jawbone says is recommended by the American Heart Association (betwen 60bpm and 100bpm). But Smart Coach never explained why. It’s not a big difference, and I attribute it to the fact that I put in 5 miles on the treadmill a few times each week. But right now, Smart Coach just basically says, ""Here’s your number,"" and only puts in extra effort if it notices something irregular. I can’t see how that’s any better than what Microsoft is doing with the Band. Even if accuracy issues remain, I have to give Redmond credit for trying experimental things and pushing forward. Apple Watch’s heart rate monitor is also said to be fairly on the mark, as is Fitbit’s Charge HR. If keeping tabs on your heart rate is important to you, the Up3 just doesn’t seem like the right choice. Hopefully Jawbone will update the device to expand its heart functionality. Otherwise, the best thing about all those advanced sensors is the sleep tracking. When I strapped on the Up3, I was optimistic this $179 thing could be just what I wanted from ""the world’s most advanced"" fitness tracker. Jawbone has nailed the software end of things marvelously; Smart Coach can definitely help keep you motivated and aware of how much activity you’re getting in every day. It’s helpful and doesn’t get obnoxious about health advice. That alone is a major selling point. Still, after all the months Jawbone spent working on the Up3, I figured this might be the perfect showcase for that mobile app. It’s not. To be clear, the Up3 isn’t terrible. It’s got all the same activity-tracking features as the Up2 and provides somewhat deeper sleep analysis compared to that $99 product. But it’s by no means worth twice the price. I can’t imagine many people will be willing to spend $180 for a single daily record of their resting heart rate. Is it really that useful of a reference for how your health goals are progressing? This is a flagship product that can't make a compelling case against a cheaper option in Jawbone’s own lineup. You’re better off with the Up2. It’s a perfectly fine tool for determining whether you’ve moved around enough in a given day. And in the end, the Up3 is really only good for that same exact thing. (Don’t expect much different from the upcoming Up4, as it’s basically this very product, plus an American Express card on your wrist, for $200.)  I wanted far more out of this product. Using those fancy sensors to track my heart at the gym or during a run doesn’t seem like too much to ask. Maybe next time.",0.6430640031321515,0.3569359968678485,0.1671066938595721,1755,4.7965811965811964,818,6.097799511002445,0,8,"Tech, Review",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The WaveRider, developed by Boeing, DARPA, and the Air Force, is designed to test the feasibility of Scramjet-powered flight. A Scramjet utilized the atmosphere's oxygen, the air compression from its own forward motion, and less fuel than a traditional rocket to propel a craft to hypersonic speeds — in this case Mach 5.1. It's called the ""WaveRider"" because part of the reason it's able to stay aloft is that it literally rides its own shockwaves. The last test of the X-51 didn't go so well, crashing down early into the Pacific after just 15 seconds. This time around, the test went smoothly. ""That vehicle flew like a bat out of hell,"" said Joe Vogel, Boeing's program manager for the X-51 project. Under its initial, more traditional rocket power and then its Scramjet power, the X-51A flew for around six minutes and 230 nautical miles.

""The extreme heavy rain end the prolonged drought side both increase drastically and are also connected physically.""  ""The new part is looking at the entire global rainfall system."" The    NASA rainfall study  study, which is due to be published in an upcoming edition of the journal Geophysical Research Letters, examined data from 14 different leading global climate models. Although each one previously predicted rainfall increases in rain-prone areas such as the tropics, and droughts in drier regions including the American Southwest, the study by Lau and his colleagues is said to be the first to look at rainfall from a global perspective, including over unpopulated areas like the middle of the oceans. ""The new part is looking at the entire global rainfall system from a basic science perspective, and what we're finding is amazing"" Lau said. NASA animation showing rainfall projections over a 140 year period. Credit: NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center Scientific Visualization Studio. Specifically, the new study found that although the 14 climate models differ when it comes to the amount of rainfall in individual locations such as cities, over larger areas, they all point to the same average picture. That is, for every single degree Fahrenheit the global average temperature climbs, heavy rainfall will increase in wet areas by 3.9 percent, while dry areas will experience a 2.6 percent increase in time periods without any rainfall. ""Dust Bowl levels by the end of the century."" ""The projected Mediterranean and southwestern US droughts forced by CO2 [carbon dioxide] increases alone exceed Dust Bowl levels by the end of the century,"" said Dargan Frierson, associate professor of atmospheric sciences at the University of Washington, who was not involved in the study. The reason for the shift is thought to be due to the fact that as the globe warms, the atmosphere is able to hold more water vapor as moisture, but this moisture clusters in the already wet areas, depriving the dry areas of moisture and exacerbating their droughts. Just how quickly the change happens depends on how much CO2 gets pumped into the atmosphere, but Lau said his study was applicable to the next century.",0.4968778972280293,0.5031221027719708,0.8860969472974993,443,5.020316027088036,253,6.0830039525691699,0,0,"Science, Report",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Last year, the Solar Impulse flew from Europe to Africa in its first intercontinental flight, and the craft had its first international flight in 2011, but today the Swiss company's cofounder and chairman is showing the United States what solar power can do. The vision: an aircraft that can fly indefinitely without consuming any fuel whatsoever. This morning, we traveled to Moffett Field to witness the occasion.   At the crack of dawn, journalists and cameramen hungrily gather around the Solar Impulse HB-SIA, an airplane that doesn't use a single drop of fuel. Before them, a runway beckons: Moffett Field, a former naval air station located in the heart of Silicon Valley. The iconic blimp hanger is undergoing restoration. Normally, its steel lattice is covered with panels. The solar plane is practically all wing and tail, with only a tiny fuselage connecting the two. Four 10-horsepower electric engines propel the craft at just 43 miles per hour. ""Our priority is not the speed, but the duration,"" says Piccard. Pilots (and co-founders) Bertrand Piccard and Andre Borschberg excitedly discuss the voyage. ""Today, we're starting a trip that's quite mythical in the history of aviation... flying coast to coast... it's one of the milestones."" The first leg of the journey will take 20 hours, says Piccard, ""but 10 years I've been dreaming of this flight."" He flew the first non-stop balloon trip around the world in 1999. The airplane's cockpit boasts a solar-powered oxygen system, an electrocardiogram to monitor the pilot's fatigue level, a live video camera connected to the internet, ""very compact energy bottles"" for nutrition, and a seat with an integrated parachute and life raft. The Solar Impulse only seats one. Though Borscheberg seemed nervous during the press conference, he cracks a big smile and shares some laughs as his partner is strapped into the cockpit. An electric bicycle, which rode alongside the aircraft as it took off. Piccard completes pre-flight checks, some thirty minutes before takeoff. Fifteen minutes before takeoff, the Solar Impulse team attaches the cockpit canopy and begins clearing ladders and supports. The Solar Impulse weighs just 3,527 pounds, but it has a wingspan of 208 feet — as wide as a Boeing 747. That wing generates so much lift that the plane can take off at 27 MPH with just a few hundred feet of runway. At 6:12AM PT, the Solar Impulse gently, quietly lifts off the tarmac.

Standard kilograms are polished cylinders made of 90 percent platinum, ten percent iridium, and stand 1.5 inches tall and 1.5 inches wide. Scientists may be nearing the end of a 15-year global effort to reinvent the kilogram, the only unit in the International System of Units that is still based on a physical weight. The original kilogram, a hunk of platinum-iridium alloy about the size of a golf ball, sits in a vault in Paris. Forty replicas are used around the world for precise measurement. However, the platinum-iridium kilograms have begun to vary in weight as they collect dust from the atmosphere, and regular steam cleanings aren't enough to keep them all consistent. It's estimated that the kilograms are seeing an average ""relative drift"" from the international prototype of .5 micrograms a year.  That's why the Swiss Federal Office of Metrology (METAS) issued a call for a new method, one that doesn't rely on a physical object. Teams of researchers are developing agnostic ways to measure the unit, including counting atoms and measuring against gravity. Today, one such team announced a breakthrough that they believe will allow them to develop a new standard for the kilogram by the 2015 deadline. 2015 is the deadline for the new kilo Researchers at Mettler Toledo, a global maker of precision measuring instruments, have developed a tiny, ultraprecise weighing cell that allows for measurements accurate within .1 micrograms, significantly more precise than the 1 microgram requested by METAS. Mettler Toledo is collaborating with Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (EPFL) and the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) to develop the so-called ""watt balance,"" an experimental scale that will allow the kilogram to be measured electronically according to the voltage required to lift the prototype in an electromagnetic field. The new weighing cell is a critical component of the watt balance. There is no guarantee that Mettler Toledo's method will be adopted by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures, as this team isn't even the only one working on the watt balance method.

Since I was the proprietor of the major web forum, it fell on me to protect the fragile cocoon of civility that nurtured the conversation. A single troll could easily derail everything.

I wound up banning anyone who used the word 'lightning.' SlateElla Morton tells the story of a secret compound where Hollywood movie studios used to go to film nuclear explosions. On Wonderland Avenue in the Hollywood Hills there's an eight-bedroom, 12-bathroom compound that was built in the early 1940s.  The exterior is a little drab, and there is nothing particularly remarkable about its appearance. But the complex, once known as Lookout Mountain, has an incredible history. Between 1947 and 1969, some of Hollywood's most talented scriptwriters, producers, editors, and directors made furtive journeys to this place to work on a top-secret project: filming nuclear explosions. The New Yorker Betsy Morais watches Mary Pilon, a writer who wrote a book about Monopoly, play the board game in her Brooklyn apartment. ‘Psychologically, it’s a weird game,’ she said. Pilon, who is twenty-eight, has short blond hair, and wore a polka dot skirt. ‘When people say they hate Monopoly, it’s because they lose so bad. They lose their assets. It’s hard to reverse negative momentum. With Clue, if you make the wrong guess, that’s it—there isn’t any prolonged, painful bleeding.’ She shrugged. ‘I’ve become a Monopoly dictator. Like with Free Parking, I’ll just say it’s not in the rules, because I don’t want to be here all night. I guess I’m just bringing it back to the Quakers, because that’s how they played.’ The Kernel Ryan Broderick looks back at the touchstones of internet culture, and details the reasons why some of those touchstones need to change. So take a culture of mostly white, educated men who feel victimized by the rest of society. Give them a digital space to congregate in. Then slowly start to fill that space up (not literally, of course, because the Internet is infinite) but shrink their sphere of influence. New sections of culture appear that they have no involvement in. Young people flock to mobile, they socialize on messaging apps, and they don’t care what new meme is currently trending on Reddit. They have their own memes. The Marshall Project Maurice Chammah reports on the ongoing problem of sexual assault in adult prisons, and details the ways one teenager was treated. Warning: it’s a tough read. The town of 11,000 residents, which sits in the remote center of the state, houses five prisons, and over the years, it has earned the nickname 'I Own Ya.' John, who was 17, had already gotten over the initial fear of going to an adult prison—he had spent several months at a county jail near Detroit and an intake facility in Jackson—but he also knew he would be spending longer at this lonely outpost, a minimum of three years for a couple of home invasions. It was still wintery in April, and his state-issued jacket was poor protection against the drafts coming through the broken windows, shattered by men who had passed through before. 'It was pretty ragged,' he recalled recently, 'a tear down.' This New Jersey trio do riff-heavy garage rock better than most, but their newest album proves they can do head-bobbing pop and sly hints of barely-there twee just as well. Future Brown is a supergroup, of sorts. It’s producer Fatima Al Qadiri, Lit City Trax founder J-Cush, and Asma Maroof and Daniel Pineda of DJ duo Nguzunguzu. Their debut self-titled album bends genres every which way, from hip-hop to grime to dancehall and back again. It’s what you should listen to before you go out tonight. This role-playing game leans on old-school visuals and a wacky enthusiasm for politics. We might find all of that irritating if it weren’t for the unexpected twists on the role-playing genre and those damn cheery smiles.

""We will not break the law to enforce the law."" Last August, a federal judged ruled that the city's program of pulling people aside on the street for searches was unconstitutional. In the ruling, Judge Shira Scheindlin concluded that the police department was indeed going after black and Hispanic New Yorkers on baseless suspicions, and she called for a monitor to help the city rectify faults in the program. As part of the decision, hundreds of police officers were ordered to wear cameras in order to monitor their actions. Then-Mayor Michael Bloomberg repeatedly defended the program, and he moved to have the ruling overturned under appeal. The status of that appeal has been on hold until this March, leaving the decision to continue battling for the policy under de Blasio. As a candidate, de Blasio ran for office as an outspoken critic of the Bloomberg administration's handling of the controversy.

Today, the NSA has filled that position. The agency has named Rebecca Richards, a 10-year veteran of the Department of Homeland Security, who already served in the privacy office there. She'll report directly to the NSA's director, General Keith Alexander, and she'll have two roles. ""Ms. Richards' primary job will be to provide expert advice to the director and oversight of NSA's civil liberties and privacy related activities,"" reads a statement. ""She will also develop measures to further strengthen NSA's privacy protections.""   ""You'd want to hire someone who's had this kind of experience."" From the NSA's perspective, hiring a Homeland Security privacy veteran probably makes a lot of sense. The DHS was the first government agency to explicitly establish an internal privacy office to try to stop privacy violations before they happen, and the NSA role appears to be modeled on that. ""I think it would be fair to say if you want to hire someone at the NSA to do this, you'd want to hire someone who's had this kind of experience,"" says Lee Tien, a staff attorney for the Electronic Frontier Federation. ""[Homeland Security] has been in the crossfire of privacy advocates and civil liberties advocates, and they have a similarly challenging mission."" But as Tien notes, there's a downside as well: the Department of Homeland Security isn't particularly well known for protecting the privacy of individuals. Since Congress established the DHS and its privacy office in 2002, the agency has been caught developing covert body scans, building centralized ""fusion"" surveillance systems of dubious utility, and searching laptops at border checkpoints without reasonable suspicion. It took three years and two court orders to get the TSA — a division of Homeland Security — to stop using full-body scanners at airports. Recently, Homeland Security agents seized notes from an investigative reporter and detained a moviegoer who happened to be wearing Google Glass. ""There are going to be issues about how committed they really are to privacy and civil liberties,"" admits Tien, regarding the NSA role. ""It makes you wonder, has this person been given an impossible job?"" None of that necessarily means that Richards and the DHS aren't a good place to start, though. ""In my opinion, DHS has one of the better privacy offices at intelligence agencies,"" says Michelle Richardson, legislative counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union. ""I think the bigger question here is what type of access to information will she have, and how will [NSA director] Alexander and his successor take her advice."" Both Tien and Richardson note that the US government's unapologizing stance on the NSA's actions could make it a challenge to enact any reform. ""It makes you wonder, has this person been given an impossible job,"" says Richardson. Tien adds that the NSA's secrecy could also stymie things if Richards doesn't have the power to actually investigate privacy violations — something that the Department of Homeland Security's privacy office didn't have until an act of Congress in 2007. Even Jeramie Scott, a national security fellow at the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC), doesn't seem to think that hailing from the Department of Homeland Security is a major problem with regards to the NSA. In 2009, a coalition organized by EPIC slammed the DHS privacy office, likening it to a public relations firm. But today, Scott says that though many of its privacy assessments ""read more like a justification for its actions that raise privacy issues instead of a critical analysis that properly curbs privacy-invasive activities,"" he believes the DHS privacy office does some good work. However, Scott points out that while the DHS privacy office has to comply with specific laws to document privacy violations, it's not yet clear that the NSA privacy officer will need to do so.

In November, Judge Paul Grewal found that Samsung's legal team had likely violated a court order by distributing a legal report that contained confidential information from Apple and Nokia licensing agreements. On Wednesday, Grewal affirmed his earlier decision and ordered Samsung to pay Apple and Nokia's court costs for the case, but he stopped short of imposing sanctions that would hit Samsung with more than merely monetary losses. Samsung attorney John Quinn said the team had simply failed to redact some details from a report prepared by legal expert David Teece before sending it to Samsung executives and employees. Grewal noted that even if the error was inadvertent, Quinn had learned afterwards that it contained confidential information and failed to either stop its spread or tell Apple and Nokia about the leak. He took Quinn to task for managing a team without enough oversight to catch and fix problems, and for waiting over two weeks after Nokia had filed suit against Samsung to tell Apple about the leak, ""as though hoping that would make the problem go away."" Nonetheless, Samsung managed to escape the harshest possible penalties. Apple claimed that not only did Samsung not contain the leaks, company executive Seungho Ahn actually used the information to influence a deal with Nokia's chief intellectual property officer, quoting the details of the Apple deal and saying that ""all information leaks."" Samsung has denied this, saying that Nokia was misinterpreting what was essentially a bluff based on good industry estimates and that Ahn would know better than to incriminate his own legal counsel. Grewal agreed that Samsung executives clearly had seen the report and therefore caused real damage to the companies involved, but the argument that they were leveraging information for unfair gain ultimately fell apart in court. Given this, Grewal rejected what he called ""ludicrously overbroad"" sanctions suggested by Apple and Nokia, including two-year bans on Samsung or Quinn putting themselves in any situation where they might use the leaked details. Besides court costs, Samsung's only real punishment is an official finding of guilt and an order to make sure every copy of the offending report is permanently deleted within the next two weeks.

The classes are free, although some universities will issue a verified certificate after completion of a class for a small fee starting at $39.

The app allows you to browse through an iTunes-like catalog of movies and TV shows by their posters, select one for more information, and then start streaming it after a short buffering period. It's so streamlined that anyone should be able to just pick it up and start watching.  Like Netflix, Popcorn Time makes watching movies easy What Popcorn Time actually is is a pretty face for downloading torrents, an activity that's typically going to be illegal when you're looking for major films and TV shows. This form of piracy is far from a new phenomenon, but it makes torrenting a lot more accessible than it's traditionally been — and that gives Netflix reason to worry. In particular, Netflix points to a Google Trends graph comparing the popularity of searches for Netflix, HBO, and Popcorn Time in the Netherlands. The graph shows the popularity of Popcorn Time rising sharply over the past six months, such that it's now on par with Netflix and far above HBO. Netflix calls the data ""sobering."" Of course, this is only in the Netherlands, which appears to be an outlier. Looking at global data, the graph is far different, with Netflix soaring far, far above Popcorn Time and HBO. Still, it's a sign that Popcorn Time is gaining prominence. Netflix is a great piracy deterrent because it's cheap and easy — but Popcorn Time is now making piracy easy, too. For Netflix, that's cause for concern.",0.5113106442486433,0.48868935575135675,0.13196637757122662,302,4.8675496688741724,173,5.699421965317919,0,0,"Apps, Culture, Entertainment, Tech",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

(Fi automatically selects the faster connection, as Legere mentions.)

Google surprised virtually no one when it formally announced its new cellular service plan called Project Fi today. Project Fi is currently very limited — it's an invite-only program and only works with Google's own Nexus 6 smartphone — but it offers some very interesting things when it comes to service plan pricing and network coverage. Like Republic Wireless, Google Fi is heavily reliant on Wi-Fi networks for both calls and data. But it has a unique trick up its sleeve when you don't have access to Wi-Fi: it will automatically switch between Sprint or T-Mobile's networks based on whichever service is stronger where you are. But as many people already know, Sprint and T-Mobile don't quite have the same level of coverage as Verizon and AT&T, especially in rural areas. How exactly does Google Fi's coverage stack up to AT&T and Verizon's networks? We made a slider to find out. Google Fi on the left (dark green is LTE, green is 3G, light green is 2G), AT&T 4G LTE coverage on the right (dark orange is LTE, orange is 4G, light orange is 3G). Maps provided by Google and AT&T. For whatever reason, finding accurate coverage maps from each carrier is actually pretty difficult, and the way Verizon scales its map doesn't play nicely with our image slider tool. But you can eyeball the side-by-side image below to see how Fi's coverage compares to Verizon's footprint. Google Fi on the left (dark green is LTE, green is 3G, light green is 2G), Verizon 4G LTE coverage on the right. Maps provided by Google and Verizon. It should also be noted that nationwide maps don't provide the best representation of hyperlocal coverage — how a particular service will perform at your exact home address or workplace. Google actually has a pretty great tool that lets you drill down to your exact area and what kind of service you can expect there. According to the tool, I'll get 3G service with Project Fi in the suburbs of New York City, which isn't quite as good as the speedy LTE service I can get from AT&T or Verizon in the same area. The nationwide comparison does show where Google Fi has large gaps in coverage — Montana isn't a great place to be if you're hoping to make use of the service. While Project Fi is very limited right now, it feels a lot like Google's rollout of its high-speed Fiber network, which started out slow and is gaining traction as more cities are added to its roster. Google's big developer conference is scheduled for the end of May — we'll certainly hear more about Project Fi there.

Today the company has made official its plan to offer wireless service to owners of its Nexus 6 smartphone. It's called Project Fi, and Google is launching an early invite program beginning today. ""Similar to our Nexus hardware program, Project Fi enables us to work in close partnership with leading carriers, hardware makers, and all of you to push the boundaries of what's possible,"" the company wrote in a blog post. The service is only available for the Nexus 6 and requires a special SIM card for Project FI — it will work with both existing Nexus 6 devices and new ones. Google says that right now the service is only available as an ""early access program,"" and during that program it won't work on other phones. Google's new offering is unique in that the company will charge consumers only for the data they use rather than hit them with a flat monthly fee that comes with a preset amount of data. If you fail to use all the data you've paid for, Google will refund you the difference. For $20 a month you get all the basics (talk, text, Wi-Fi tethering, and international coverage in 120+ countries), and then it's a flat $10 per GB for cellular data while in the U.S. and abroad. 1GB is $10/month, 2GB is $20/month, 3GB is $30/month, and so on. Since it's hard to predict your data usage, you'll get credit for the full value of your unused data. Let's say you go with 3GB for $30 and only use 1.4GB one month. You'll get $16 back, so you only pay for what you use. If you go over your plan, Google will simply charge you at a pro-rated rate of $10 per GB. In other words, if you pay for data and don't use it, you get refunded. If you don't buy data and use it, you end up paying the same amount. There are no family plans available, but neither does it require a contract of any kind. As reported previously, Google will operate its wireless service with the help of both T-Mobile and Sprint; customers will have access to both networks, and Google's service will intelligently switch between them and Wi-Fi to maintain strong reception. ""We developed new technology that gives you better coverage by intelligently connecting you to the fastest available network at your location whether it's Wi-Fi or one of our two partner LTE networks,"" the company said. Project Fi also supports voice calls and texting over Wi-Fi, lending subscribers more flexibility and how and where they can communicate with their contacts. Google also says it's using secure tech (there's a key that shows up in your menu bar) for when you're using public Wi-Fi hotspots. Project Fi phone numbers ""live in the cloud,"" according to Google, enabling you to text and place voice calls from a laptop or tablet without your actual phone nearby. When you are on the phone, Google says calls can seamlessly transition to LTE when you leave a Wi-Fi network. Google seems to be using the new, combined Hangouts / Google Voice infrastructure in some way for Fi, as its FAQ references it often.

Instead of hammering out the sale, Comcast reportedly convinced its partners that it could raise Hulu's value and make it a true competitor to Netflix, promises that played a significant role in the decision to pull Hulu off the market, according to The New York Times. Comcast is restricted from making management decisions involving Hulu Due to its deal with the Justice Department when it acquired NBC Universal (through which Comcast acquired its stake in Hulu), Comcast's role in management decisions involving Hulu were severely restricted. Comcast agreed not to ""influence, control, or participate in the governance or management of Hulu,"" and its influence over the potential sale of Hulu has raised questions within the government about how compliant Comcast would be if restrictions were placed on the proposed Time Warner Cable merger. The Justice Department will sit down with Comcast on Wednesday to discuss its potential merger with Time Warner Cable, and Hulu is bound to come up.

On an earnings call yesterday, CEO (and former Google executive) Marissa Mayer said that Yahoo was ""particularly interested in search in the mobile sector, what happens when you involve context,"" and it's apparently focusing attention on ""what happens when you involve personal information, from things like email."" Today, Business Insider reports that a source has provided more details about the project, which is supposedly known as Index. Index is supposed to be a smartphone app, following up on Yahoo's current Aviate launcher for Android. Aviate acts as a personal assistant using smartphone data and calendar entries, but this would act more like Google Now, mining information from users' inboxes. According to the source, Yahoo is attempting to have a pilot version ready sometime in the second quarter of this year. ""Yahoo has many 20-year-old accounts.""On the call, Mayer referred to things like Siri, Cortana, and Google Now as a new and promising kind of search. She said that as mobile moves to ""the watch and onto television screens and video,"" Yahoo wants to help people ""make better sense of the content they already have access to, content in their mail,"" to provide better results. She gave the example of learning that a user had booked a flight from John F. Kennedy Airport, then prioritizing their search to favor practical data and a boarding pass over, say, Wikipedia. Helping users find flight information is a fairly fundamental task for a mobile assistant like Google Now, Siri, or Cortana. According to Business Insider's source, though, Yahoo thinks its advantage lies in sheer longevity: ""Gmail users have only had their accounts for 10 years. Yahoo has many 20-year-old accounts. Back then people used to email themselves a lot — store things. To surface that kind of data usefully is exciting.""

In less grandiose terms, it's basically an iPhone case for cops, providing military-grade biometric scanning on the move. The AOptix shell is built to provide everything an officer needs to process a suspect on the spot. There's a fingerprint scanner on the back, the capacity for facial recognition, and the new guest at the party: an iris scanner. The camera's a little tricky — you have to hold it a little less than a foot away, and keep it steady for a few seconds — but otherwise, using the Stratus is like taking pictures with a heavier, clunkier iPhone. Crucially, it's small enough to hold with just one hand, so the officer using it can still reach for his gun. Or maybe not a police officer at all. The Stratus has only been on the market a few weeks, but AOptix is already pitching it for use at border crossings and in airport security. The US Department of Defense is interested too, and provided a $3 million grant for AOptix to develop the tech further. Once it's normalized, scanning your iris could become as routine as swiping a credit card. ""We really feel it's going to be an inflection point in the biometrics industry,"" AOptix marketing director Joey Pritikin told The Verge. ""We can do business, we can conduct health care, we can go to disaster areas. This will really open up new markets."" After years of lurking in the margins, AOptix thinks iris scanning is ready for the big time. Outside of the West, it's already there.  Hundreds of millions of Indians have already been iris-printed, along with thousands of Iraqi civilians and anyone who goes through customs regularly in Dubai. It's the gold standard of a modern ID program, easier than fingerprinting and more stable than facial recognition. All you have to do is look at the camera and open your eyes. And unlike in retinal scans, the scanner doesn't need to be up close. It's just a photograph, taken in infrared, which in theory could work if taken from across the room. If this sounds familiar, it's probably because you saw something like it in Minority Report, where omnipresent eye-flashers identify everyone who walks through a public plaza, targeting ads at them and feeding the police information about their every move. Even Pritikin acknowledges the precedent, saying, ""Tom Cruise did not do us any favors."" But within the industry, the product is less exotic, just the latest and best solution to the persistent problem of quick, reliable identification. What does the world look like when proving ID is as easy as taking a photograph? Like it or not, we're about to find out. Like a lot of technologies, iris recognition’s first big rollout came at the hands of the US military. Soldiers needed a way to keep track of Iraqi civilians, most of whom weren't carrying photo ID.  A company called MorphoTrust built the HIIDE, a two-handed iris scanning device. If the military was investigating the aftermath of an IED, HIIDE allowed soldiers to iris-print everyone in the vicinity and check the results against a database of previous suspects. When dealing with possible enemy combatants, privacy concerns simply weren't an issue. The technology then took a familiar path from the military to law enforcement, ultimately aiming at the civilian world. As soldiers got comfortable with the tech, they started using it on friendlies too, verifying non-US nationals who wanted to work on the base. Fingerprinting a line cook every morning would have been too unwieldy, but handheld iris scanning was fast enough to work in a situation where a false ID might be a matter of life or death. Once iris scanning had been proven on the battlefield, it moved to federal law enforcement, doing duty at customs offices and border crossing sites. If you find yourself flying into Dubai, you can see it in action. The city’s airport recently made the switch to an automated two-gate customs system, also made by AOptix. Scanning your passport opens the first gate; an iris print opens the second. Once the system is fully deployed, the company says it will bring wait times down from 49 minutes to 22 seconds. A private company called Clear is already trying this on an opt-in basis in the US. In exchange for a quick iris scan, their service will let you skip security in half  a dozen American airports. The bargain is simple enough: In exchange for one more biometric, you get to skip an hour in customs, or the indignity of a TSA checkpoint search. And as an ID technology, it simply works better. It's less invasive, harder to fake (although still possible), and more effective at everything we want ID tech to be good at. Of course, that same effectiveness makes a Minority Report future all the more plausible. For countries with national ID programs, this Orwellian scenario is already starting to play out. In collaboration with MorphoTrust, India has already iris-printed 350 million of its citizens as part of its national ID program, and they're on track to scan all 1.2 billion. This year, Mexico will roll out the first iris-matched ID cards in the world as part of a $25 million program. In both cases, the ID will help stop fraud and provide poverty assistance, helping solve half a dozen urgent humanitarian issues at once. Despite these good intentions, this kind of mass identification has civil libertarians very worried. ""The concern is that biometrics will be used for the mass tracking of individuals,"" according to Jay Stanley of the American Civil Liberties Union. ""If that kind of ID system becomes routine and widespread, it turns us into a kind of checkpoint society."" Even in India, the system is still only used at police stations and government offices, but once the print is connected to a universal ID, it's easy to imagine iris scans becoming as commonplace as pulling out a driver's license. Judging by the technology itself, we may be just a few technical breakthroughs away from Minority Report-style eye-flashers. Right now, most iris capturing happens close up because the cameras need flashes of infrared light to illuminate the eye. Too strong a flash will damage the retina, so the devices rely on weaker flashes from closer in. But aside from the flash issues, AOptix says the same technology can work from as far as 60 feet away. The only reason the feature isn’t available is that AOptix saw more money in TSA-style checkpoints. ""We didn't see a compelling market for the long-range iris tech,"" Pritikin says. ""It's essentially surveillance, CCTV but for iris, and there's a limited market for that."" It's good news, but small comfort. If an oppressive regime wanted to pick up the technology and run with it, it would be hard to stop them. For now, we're left with less invasive devices like the Stratus, an iris camera aimed squarely at US law enforcement. The FBI is already building an iris system to track persons of interest, and it's not hard to see them using a Stratus-like device to collect prints. Iris cameras haven't landed in the hands of beat cops yet, but AOptix is trying its best to get them there. The path of the technology, from the military to local law enforcement, is almost complete. The only question is what it will look like when it gets here.",0.43677528628931284,0.5632247137106872,0.19034928275156807,1265,4.8529644268774703,639,6.267605633802817,0,0,,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The six working prototypes, known as ""Morphees,"" are thin, electronic displays capable of automatically changing shape to perform certain functions. Researchers say that if brought to market, the devices could usher in a new era in mobile computing, breaking down the physical barriers that have traditionally defined smartphones, tablets, and gaming consoles. Project leader Anne Roudaut, a researcher at the University of Bristol in the UK, outlined her team’s developments in a paper published this week for the Association of Computing Machinery (ACM). One design transforms a smartphone into the shape of a gaming controller, its edges folding downward to allow for more comfortable two-thumb playing; another caves inward like an origami flower, shielding the display from the view of strangers. Each design incorporates different technologies and materials — wood, paper, and plastic — but they all point to the same vision.   ""all mobile devices should change shape.""   ""In the future, all mobile devices should change shape so that form factor better fits functionality,"" Roudaut said Monday in Paris, where she presented her team's paper at the annual Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI). Such shape-shifting devices, she continued, would allow software makers to cater their applications to specific physical configurations. ""We should all be able to go into an app store, download an application, and that application should come with its own form factor,"" Roudaut explained. In an interview with The Verge, the researcher said her technology could be scaled up to tablet- or TV-sized form factors, though the six prototypes are still years away from deployment. Her current designs don't allow for high screen resolution, and they still require thinner, more powerful batteries. But two Morphee prototypes are significantly more advanced than the rest.   In one design, wooden tiles are sewn together with ""shape memory alloys"" — metals that bend when jolted with an electric current. As demonstrated in the above video, touching any corner of this display causes it to automatically fold upward, transforming it into a box-like shape. The other prototype uses ""home-educated"" shape memory alloys to fold into a cylindrical form, creating a more console-like configuration. According to Roudaut, its name derives from the fact that it can be programmed to morph into a specific form. ""You can actually train the material — you can educate the material to create a different shape,"" she tells The Verge. She notes that this capability could be used to turn a smartphone into a stress ball or to create different physical keyboards, though its future ultimately rests in the hands of developers. ""If we can give developers the tools to experiment, they may come up with many more uses — just like what Apple did with the App Store."" The immediate outlook may be uncertain for Roudaut’s Morphees, though major handset manufacturers have begun investing more heavily in flexible display smartphones, with LG promising to launch one by the end of this year. In the longer term, Roudaut envisions a world in which consumers evaluate mobile devices based not only on screen resolution and processing power, but on what she and her colleagues call ""shape resolution"" — technical specifications that describe a phone’s ability to change shape ""on demand."" The idea is to create mobile devices with more affordance — qualities that clearly convey how an object should be used. A door knob, for instance, is clearly designed to be used in a certain way, as are more organic forms like bananas, their stems inviting users to pull back their peels. Smartphone design, by contrast, has thus far remained uniform and ambiguous, despite the rich variety of mobile apps. ""Affordance is everywhere in everyday life,"" Roudaut explains. ""Shapes guide functionality, and I find it amazing that mobile phones don't do that.""",0.7160512086790484,0.28394879132095163,0.715188447004874,657,5.2907153729071537,388,6.4201030927835054,0,0,"Mobile, Science, Report",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

At least that's the promise of a state-backed initiative that hopes to set a precedent across the country. Called ""The Patient Portal for New Yorkers,"" the venture marks the first time a US state has tried to share comprehensive, digitized medical data, provided by doctors and hospitals, with patients. It's also an ambitious attempt to succeed where private efforts have largely failed: Google, for instance, last year shut down its own patient portal, Google Health, after the venture didn't gain traction with users.    ""For patients, the applications here are going to be huge."" ""We're arguably the most advanced state in the country working on this,"" Paul Wilder, the vice president of product management at the New York eHealth Collaborative, a nonprofit working in conjunction with the New York State Department of Health on the venture, told The Verge. ""For patients, the applications here are going to be huge."" In part because those behind the project ""didn't know what to build,"" they decided to crowdsource the portal design. This past Tuesday in New York City, the top nine designs were unveiled, with a winner to be selected in mid-May. That design will serve as a framework for the final portal, though ""anything from any contestant can be used in the final product,"" Wilder said. ""We want to use the best of the best."" A veritable playground for health aficionados. A glimpse at demo videos from finalists, some of which are included in this story, suggests that the initiative aspires to create a veritable playground for health aficionados — and act as an important resource for those with chronic illnesses. Over soundtracks of soothing jazz, the demos promise a treasure trove of possibilities: patients will track prescriptions, read appointment memos, send notes to doctors, and even log workouts, blood pressure, and other personal health metrics. Officials with the project say that a first iteration will roll out to New Yorkers within a year. But when it does, questions persist about what information, and how much of it, users can actually expect to see.  On its face, the implementation of New York's patient portal seems simple enough — mostly because the backbone that'll feed it with data already exists. New York has spent several years developing what's called a Health Information Exchange (HIE) to allow medical providers to share patient info amongst themselves. ""HIE is like a Google for patient information,"" Wilder explains. ""A provider can see what other work has been done, what prescriptions a patient has been given, or what previous test results they've had. It's a great coordination tool."" In New York, doctors can even trade direct messages through the service. Right now, New York's HIE is divided geographically into 11 zones — meaning medical providers who opt into HIE can trade information and communicate on a regional level. Last year, as a stepping stone to the patient portal, officials announced plans to unify those exchanges into one statewide HIE, a process that remains ongoing. ""A user-friendly interface that [patients] want to interact with."" The patient portal would harness all of the data collected by that HIE, and open it up to patients ""in a user-friendly interface that they'll want to interact with,"" Wilder said. Eventually, the portal will also allow patients to input some of their own information, like workout history or weight, though ""we still need to figure out which data from patients will be reliable, and a good way to separate it from clinical data,"" Wilder added. By relying on a backbone of clinical info, the New York portal has the potential to succeed where ventures like Google Health haven't, experts consulted by The Verge said. ""Google tried something similar, but they didn't have that connectivity to the clinical side,"" Shahid Shah, a software consultant who specializes in health IT, said. ""Without that link, the onus on the patient to input all of their own data is really quite high ... and there's a persistent question about how to make that kind of database profitable."" ""New York is really taking the bull by the horns."" ""New York is really taking the bull by the horns,"" Shah added. ""If they succeed, they'll be setting the groundwork for everyone else to understand how this can actually work.""  If only success was going to be easy. New York might be making a bold foray into open-access patient data, but significant hurdles remain before this kind of portal will actually offer any real benefits to users, experts said. Arguably most important: medical providers have yet to jump onto the e-health bandwagon with significant enthusiasm - around 57 percent of physicians nationwide use electronic records — and even fewer are linking those e-records to HIE networks. By Wilder's own estimate, ""around 80 percent of hospitals, 50 percent of clinics, and [less than 20 percent] of specialty care providers"" in the state are currently using the HIE. ""What's coming through a portal is not gospel."" In other words, that vital backbone remains incomplete. ""This entire process assumes that the foundations of the database are actually working,"" Ateev Mehrotra, MPH, a health care policy analyst at RAND Corporation, said. ""I would be skeptical about whether that's actually fully formed."" Furthermore, Mehrotra said, questions remain about just how accurate digitized information actually is: e-records are often hampered by inaccurate and outdated data, ""and stuff stays in the system and it doesn't get corrected,"" he said. Those inaccuracies are often confusing for patients, and in worst-case scenarios, they're downright dangerous. ""There is a hyper-enthusiasm and overconfidence that troubles me,"" Scot Silverstein, MD, an expert in medical informatics at Drexel University, said. ""Patients need to know that what's coming through a portal is not gospel."" ""Vendors themselves have become data merchants."" Convincing medical providers to hand their data over to a statewide system is yet another problem. Largely, that's because many of them rely on private vendors to operate their e-record systems, and those vendors aren't always enthusiastic about opening up a bounty of patient information. ""Vendors themselves have become data merchants,"" Silverstein said. ""They have an incentive not to provide patient data, or at least to make it very costly."" And then there's the issue of security. Anecdotal evidence points to myriad instances of e-record systems being breached at medical centers across the country. In one 2010 instance, 1.7 million patients were affected by the theft of electronic health records from a network of hospitals in the Bronx. But New York State has since tightened its security regulations, Wilder said, and the patient portal will be ""encrypted and secure,"" and include ""two factor security"" for both providers and patients.  Combined, this bevy of challenges suggest that any statewide patient portal deployed in the near future risks being something of a mess. Some patients might log on and obtain a wealth of data, while others might see gaps, errors, or confusing inconsistencies. ""I'm skeptical at the idea that this can have a real impact on patients right now,"" Peter Stetson, MD, associate professor of clinical informatics at Columbia University, said. ""I haven't seen [the portal], but it sounds like a lot of confusion."" ""The patient should be the sherpa of their own information."" Officials behind New York's portal admit they haven't solved every challenge just yet. At least where gaps in medical data are concerned, Wilder notes that patients will be able to upload documents they obtain from doctors who use e-records but don't participate in the HIE. ""Our goal is that the patient gets all of the data,"" he said. ""The patient should be the sherpa of their own information."" Whether patients can initially access all that data, in a way that's user-friendly and secure, remains an open question. But despite the vexing challenges the project faces, it might at least offer more lessons in what to do — and not to do — in the future. ""New York is showing thought leadership where it matters,"" Shah said. ""These conversations wouldn't be happening if they weren't giving this a shot.""",0.5760531218937714,0.42394687810622855,0.16403426040529098,1411,5.1410347271438699,674,6.4228486646884271,0,0,"Science, Report",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

According to The Independent, Professor Hualan Chen and her team deliberately mixed the 2009 strain of H5N1 bird-flu virus — which is incredibly lethal but is not easily transmitted between people — with a 2009 strain of H1N1 flu virus, which is known to be very infectious. The tests have been branded ""appallingly irresponsible"" by a former UK government chief scientist over worries that the new strains could escape laboratory environments and cause a global pandemic. Five H5N1 and H1N1 hybrids passed via airborne transmission between laboratory guinea pigs Chen has already created 127 viral hybrids in an attempt to emulate what happens when animals are coinfected with two different strains of the influenza virus. Early studies have shown that H5N1 bird-flu viruses can be adapted for transmission between humans, with five H5N1 and H1N1 hybrids passing via airborne transmission between laboratory guinea pigs. The effects on humans are unknown, but scientists believe it is very likely that some — if not all — of the hybrids could be transmitted between humans. While virologist Professor Simon Wain-Hobson of the Pasteur Institute in Paris believes that Chen's work is ""a fabulous piece of virology,"" he warns that the research will be of little use for the development of vaccines or tracking of new flu viruses. Last year, the US government joined scientists worldwide by temporarily suspending research on H5N1 pathogens. However, it announced that research will resume this year under tighter regulations as it continues its efforts to develop a vaccine ""to prepare for a possible pandemic.""

Those efforts have relied on ground-based telescopes and spacecraft, in an attempt to identify clues about the conditions of worlds thousands of light years away. But the entire search depends on one fundamental, widely-accepted premise — that these planets must exist within the ""habitable zone,"" a narrow band around other stars where an orbiting planet’s surface would not be too hot, but also not too cold, to support liquid water. Now, several astronomers are making a provocative suggestion: broaden the search far beyond planets like Earth, to include other strange worlds, from Dune-like planets with almost no liquid water, to gaseous giants with atmospheres full of hydrogen.    ""The logic is that water is required for all life as we know it."" ""The logic is that water is required for all life as we know it,"" said Sara Seager, professor of planetary sciences and physics at MIT, and the author of a new paper, published in the journal Science today, that summarizes proposed theories to include other exoplanets — worlds outside our solar system — that aren’t in the habitable zone. ""If an exoplanet has surface liquid water, it could host life. Planets very different than Earth can maintain surface liquid water, with similar temperatures to Earth's surface."" There’s no specific distance that defines the reaches of a habitable zone, as it varies depending on the size of the star and how luminous it is (larger, more luminous stars tend to have larger habitable zones). The concept has been refined many times since it was first proposed in the 1960s. For stars like our Sun, the zone is now generally agreed to be between 0.99 and 1.70 astronomical units (about 92 million miles to 158 million miles) away, putting Earth near the innermost edge. Still, Seager and other scientists say that it should be expanded dramatically, both inward and outward for a solar system like ours, to between 0.5 and 10 astronomical units. Image of the surface of Venus taken by NASA's Magellan spacecraft circa 1991. Credit: NASA/JPL.    planets much further or closer to their stars could support water Under this new proposal, only a ""handful"" of nearby exoplanets — out of the more than 2,700 candidates that scientists have located thus far — would be added to the elite list of 60 to 70 that are in the habitable zone. But expanding the zone would still increase the chances of life existing elsewhere in the universe. The proposals to expand the concept still keep surface water as a requirement for habitability, but they do upend the conventional wisdom about what conditions can lead to liquid water. Even planets much further or closer to their stars compared to the Earth’s distance from the Sun could support liquid water, Seager and others hypothesize. For planets quite close to their parent stars, such as Venus relative to the Sun, this may be possible so long as a planet is a dry, mostly desert world — meaning it doesn’t have too much water vapor in its atmosphere, which traps heat. ""Water is Earth's most serious greenhouse gas,"" Seager told The Verge. ""Hence a planet with little water vapor will not get overheated if the planet is closer to the star than Earth is to the Sun."" Venus itself may have been habitable over a billion years ago under this theory, but is thought to have had its greenhouse gas effect go into overdrive as the Sun's luminousity steadily increased.  ""I think a Dune-like planet is a perfectly reasonable idea."" Other scientists aren’t so sure. ""I think a Dune-like planet is a perfectly reasonable idea,"" said David Catling, a professor of planetary sciences and astrobiology at the University of Washington, referring to the desert world Arrakis in Frank Herbert’s 1965 sci-fi classic. ""However, I doubt that a planet that is mostly dry is going to have the intensity of biosignatures that you would get from a more Earth-like object covered in oceans."" Catling pointed out that the idea of a planet like Arrakis supporting life was first articulated in a paper published in 2011 by US and Japanese scientists.  Seager’s new review paper references this and many other studies, including some that support expanding the habitable zone outward to go as far away as Saturn, so long as these types of planets have hydrogen-rich atmospheres. Image of Saturn captured by the Voyager 2 spacecraft. Credit: NASA Planetary Photojournal.   ""[Hydrogen] can make planets at Earth's equivalent orbit way too hot, but can also extend the habitable zone by enabling planets to be hotter far from the star,"" Seager said. However, Catling disagrees, pointing out that water microbes on Earth consume hydrogen, eliminating it from the atmosphere. Thus, if a planet has tons of hydrogen in the atmosphere that’s not being eaten by microbes, it’s probably not inhabited. ""I think that hydrogen is actually an ‘anti-biosignature,’"" Catling told The Verge. ""Its high abundance in an atmosphere says ‘no one home’."" ""If so, then the habitable zone is everywhere!"" Still one of the founders of the modern concept of the habitable zone says that exoplanets with hydrogen-rich atmospheres are good candidates for habitability, including so-called ""rogue planets,"" floating alone in interstellar space without any nearby star to heat them. ""Planets with captured H2 [hydrogen] atmospheres could conceivably remain habitable even if they are no longer attached to their parent stars,"" said James Kasting, professor of geosciences at Pennsylvania State University. ""If so, then the habitable zone is everywhere! But this makes the whole concept moot.""  Artist's concept of a ""rogue planet"" floating without a star in interstellar space. Credit: ESO/P. Delorme/Nick Risinger (skysurvey.org)/R. Saito/VVV Consortium.   Still, Kasting says we should keep the standard definition of a habitable zone in mind when it comes to designing new planet-hunting telescopes. ""It helps provide criteria for how big and refined a telescope one needs in order to search for habitable planets,"" Kasting said. But he’s also open to the possibility of expanding that definition once new telescopes have been designed. ""We know that life did get started on Earth. So if we can find other Earth-like planets and look for evidence of life, we should able to develop a pretty good answer"" to the question of whether or not we’re alone in the universe.",0.5866910569458956,0.41330894305410437,0.34466783989824745,1069,5.0636108512628626,506,6.3063241106719365,0,0,"Science, Report",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

As experts continue to broaden their understanding of genetics and cognitive science, for instance, Insel anticipates the possibility of more rigorous diagnoses. ""Patients with mental disorders deserve better,"" he added. To promote those rigorous diagnoses, the NIMH will now focus on funding research that digs into these underlying biological mechanisms. The eventual goal, Insel writes, is to collect ""the genetic, imaging, physiologic, and cognitive data to see how all the data — not just the symptoms — cluster and how these clusters relate to treatment response.""

Right now, though, it's apparently apparently trying to gauge just how big of a problem Twitter abuse really is. Its mobile app is inviting some users (specifically, verified users, as far as we can tell) to take a short survey about their personal experiences and opinions on the platform. It doesn't seem to ask the same questions of everyone, but among other things, it asks how important it is to see interactions, how much they worry about harassment on Twitter, and the overall level of abuse users receive on other services, like YouTube. This is the first time we've seen this survey, but Adria Richards, who was at the center of a vitriolic fight about tech and gender in 2013 and is still regularly harassed, tweeted about receiving an invitation on February 18th.   How helpful is this, exactly? It's a start, and it's certainly not harmful. It comes after a change that (theoretically) makes it harder for suspended users to come back with a new account, requiring them to verify an email address or phone number if they continue to harass. None of it is a panacea, and if stopping harassment in general is hard, it's particularly difficult on Twitter.

The president outlined the proposal during his fifth State of the Union address Tuesday evening, though details on the new centers remain thin. In pushing for more domestic high-tech manufacturing, Obama echoed last year's State of the Union speech, in which he lauded his administration's efforts to create a 3D printing lab and training center in Youngstown, Ohio. Earlier this month, he announced a second manufacturing institute in Raleigh, North Carolina, which will develop more energy-efficient semiconductor technologies for cars and consumer electronics. The president didn't specify where the six centers proposed last night will be located, or what industries they will focus on, though he said congressional support could help launch even more hubs in the future.   ""get those bills to my desk and put more Americans back to work.""   ""We ... have the chance, right now, to beat other countries in the race for the next wave of high-tech manufacturing jobs,"" Obama said Tuesday. ""Tonight, I'm announcing we'll launch six more this year. Bipartisan bills in both houses could double the number of these hubs and the jobs they create. So, get those bills to my desk and put more Americans back to work."" The announcement drew applause and some standing ovations from members of Congress. Several tech companies have begun moving operations back to the US in recent months. Apple brought some Mac manufacturing back to the US last year — a move that earned Obama's praise during last year's State of the Union — while Google-owned Motorola has also begun manufacturing its Moto X smartphone domestically. Some foreign companies are following the move, as well; last week, Taiwan-based Foxconn revealed that it is considering manufacturing some large displays in the US, after devoting $40 million to developing robotic technologies in Pennsylvania. Obama hopes to see more manufacturing hubs in the future, though significant expansion would require congressional support. Last year, the president called upon Congress to invest $1 billion in a network of 15 advanced manufacturing centers, with the hope of expanding that number to 45 over the next decade. The North Carolina center announced this month was supported by $70 million in federal funds, under a public-private partnership with 18 businesses and six universities. ""I don't want the next big job creating discovery, the research and technology, to be in Germany, or China, or Japan,"" the president said this month during a speech at North Carolina State University.

Yesterday, one of the major fronts closed down. Since July, tech companies had been putting pressure on the Department of Justice, fighting for the right to say more about their interactions with law enforcement. Yesterday they made peace, reaching a settlement and withdrawing a class action suit that had drawn in some of the most powerful companies in America. On this front at least, reformers have likely gotten all they’re going to get. The deal was ""understood to resolve the question of transparency"" From the outside, it looked like a simple response to the president's recent NSA order, but according to the Wall Street Journal's reporting, it was the result of intricate backroom negotiations between tech companies and the administration, the end of a conversation that's been going on for months. As soon as the order was announced, the companies quietly dropped their motion against the FISA court, declining to comment beyond a short prepared statement: As one Obama aide told Politico more simply, the deal was ""understood to resolve the question of transparency around national security."" As far as the courts were concerned, the tech companies had won. It's the kind of compromise President Obama loves So what did they win, exactly? On the transparency side, companies get to add two new columns to their transparency reports, announcing the general number of national security letters and FISA warrants alongside traditional warrants and wiretaps. The numbers still aren’t exact, lumped into bands of 250 or 1,000, but users can now have a general idea of the volume of requests companies are receiving through those channels. In exchange for that, the government gets a two-year window in which new methods can’t be disclosed. So if Microsoft were to launch an all-new chat platform tomorrow, the government will have at least two years between the first data request and the first transparency report, supposedly lulling gullible terrorists into a false sense of security. It also applies to entirely new kinds of warrant, so if terrorists start sending self-destructing messages through Snapchat, the same two-year lag time will apply. It's the kind of compromise President Obama loves, locking both sides into a limited version of what they want. There's some chilling effect, since users of smaller services will never know whether a given service is in the two-year window or not — but in the long term, two years is just a snippet, hardly enough time for society to spiral into a surveillance dystopia. As long as all the programs are disclosed within two years, then the public will be generally informed about the government's surveillance programs, and the gears of democracy can take it from there. The disclosure rules only apply to ""customer selectors"" If that were the whole story, privacy advocates would be declaring victory right now — but they're not. That's because the order also leaves a number of loopholes that seem to be designed to let programs like PRISM slip by unnoticed. ACLU chief technologist Chris Soghoian has already raised concerns that the disclosure rules only apply to ""customer selectors"" targeting individual users. That would mean a FISA warrant for a specific person or email address would be included in the numbers, but it might not include broader queries that brought up anyone who emailed the word ""terrorist"" or started accessing their account from Yemen. The order only addresses bulk collection programs in a footnote, offering vague assurances at best. Where does that leave PRISM, or the network-tapping efforts that allowed the NSA to pull wholesale data from Google and Yahoo networks? Those programs are still closed off, effectively unreportable. Tech companies have been looking for something simpler: trust That's a big concern for the ACLU, but for Google and others, it may be beside the point. While NSA reformers have been crusading for fundamental changes in US surveillance, tech companies have been looking for something simpler: trust. All the web's most successful products are built on trust, from Gmail and Facebook on down. If web users stop trusting the service, they’ll simply leave so that trust must be protected at all costs. Disclosure isn't just a public service; it's a business imperative. So when Google wrote an open letter to the FBI director this summer, it opened with the simple statement, ""Google has worked tremendously hard over the past 15 years to earn our users’ trust."" In a joint letter to President Obama, signed by eight of the largest companies in tech, Apple, Microsoft and others asked the president to consider ""users’ reasonable privacy interests and the impact on trust in the internet."" As the CEO of CloudFlare told me back in October, ""we are fundamentally in the business of trust."" ""Google has worked tremendously hard over the past 15 years to earn our users' trust."" Yesterday's deal protects that trust, but it doesn't go further. It's a move back to the pre-Snowden state, with fights over targeted surveillance obscuring more secretive programs that suck up data in bulk and escape accountability entirely. Those programs, with PRISM chief among them, are at the core of the NSA’s surveillance efforts, but they’ve been increasingly ignored by the president’s reform efforts. In last week’s speech, he laid out plans to reform the phone-records program and the FISA courts, but the programs targeting the open web went largely unmentioned. Unless someone forces the issue, it’s likely to stay that way. If you care about web freedom, that’s a scary thought. Programs like PRISM strike at the nature of the internet itself, establishing a breed of totalizing surveillance on a scale that would be unthinkable elsewhere. The free flow of data, once a tool of freedom, becomes something much darker. Any true reform will have to grapple with that fact. The president has made progress, but those crucial reforms are still missing, and each new empty gesture makes it less likely they’ll appear. After the transparency deal, we’re left with an even scarier thought: the companies with the biggest stake in the web may not be interested in defending it.",0.4195295491671631,0.5804704508328369,0.5149217214945215,1047,5.1862464183381087,556,6.3525179856115104,0,0,"Policy & Law, US & World, Report",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

This morning's remarkably hostile Senate hearing pitted Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, FBI head James Comey, and their Congressional supporters against senators who wanted hard, public answers to questions whose answers have been kept ambiguous or under wraps to all but a few officials. In a series of curt questions, Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR), a longtime surveillance critic, extracted hard promises of information from the NSA, CIA, and FBI. Within 30 days, Clapper has agreed to reveal whether intelligence agencies have ever searched through records for information about specific US citizens. CIA director John Brennan will answer within a week whether the limits of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act apply to his agency. Comey will lay out what burden of proof FBI agents must meet before tracking cellphone location data from either apps or cell towers. By next month, we're also promised an answer to one of the most important questions in the debate over phone record collection: have intelligence agencies ever needed immediate access to information that was so old cellphone companies would no longer store it? Obama has promised to move the NSA's phone record database to a third party, possibly by asking cellphone companies to store data for longer. But the program's effectiveness is already in question, and so far, we know relatively little about when and how it's actually been used. ""Simply using the metric of plots foiled is not necessarily a way to get at the value of the program."" Today, Senator Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) passionately denounced Obama's decision to move the database to an outside party, something he said would take away a ""core government function"" without protecting privacy. But others echoed a recent watchdog committee report that found the program both unconstitutional and relatively ineffective. The White House has officially disagreed with the panel's conclusions, and Clapper said that although the program has never actually been necessary to solve a case, it allows the NSA to know if a terrorist has not been communicating with US numbers. ""Simply using the metric of plots foiled is not necessarily a way to get at the value of the program."" Following conflicting decisions in lower courts, Senator Barbara Mikulski (D-MD) asked Clapper to officially condone a fast-tracked Supreme Court decision on whether the program itself was legal, cutting off his reference to one of the dozens of cases. Meanwhile, Clapper's official Twitter account tweeted his testimony throughout the hearing: The stark consequences of this perfect storm are plainly evident: the Intel Community is going to have less capacity to protect our nation… But, if dealing with reduced capabilities is what is needed to ensure the faith and confidence of the American people… …then we in the Intelligence Community will work as hard as we can to meet the expectations before us. Unsurprisingly, Snowden himself came up for attack. Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) opened the hearing by steering discussion towards threats worldwide, saying she was concerned that successful anti-terrorism work has created a false sense of security. In response to a question from Susan Collins (R-ME), Defense Intelligence Agency director Michael Flynn said the greatest price of the leaks would likely be ""the cost in human lives on tomorrow's battlefields."" Clapper himself declined to say whether he thought leaked documents had ended up in Russian hands — a claim Snowden vehemently denies — due to an ongoing investigation. Despite Snowden's prominence in the hearing, his name still eluded both Collins and Mikulski, who respectively referred to him as ""Edwin"" and ""Eric."" Snowden claims that he’s ""won,"" and his mission is accomplished.   If..so, I call on him.. to facilitate the return of.. stolen documents not yet.. exposed, to prevent even more damage to US security.    Clapper called the leaks ""the most massive and most damaging theft of intelligence information in our history."" But he backhandedly accepted that the intelligence community should ""lean in the direction of transparency,"" even if it reduced its operating power. As he and others talked about limiting the NSA's power, though, Comey emphasized the FBI's need for CISPA-like cybersecurity legislation that would let companies and government agencies share information about potential online attacks. The balance between liberty and security is far from a settled issue, but Obama has turned much of the debate over to Congress, and today's hearing is likely only a small sign of what's to come.",0.6228838078872547,0.3771161921127453,0.8355791926810467,773,5.2936610608020702,448,6.3236607142857144,0,0,"Policy & Law, US & World, National Security",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

On Tuesday, Virginia judge Raymond Jackson set an ongoing royalty rate that Google owes a patent and ringtone company called Vringo in addition to the millions in damages it was ordered to pay last year. The case could theoretically net Vringo hundreds of millions of dollars a year, all because of two patents from the early days of search engines. Vringo produces video ringtones and a Facebook-based app called ""FaceTones,"" but its big business is buying and leveraging patents — a struggling Nokia, for example, sold Vringo 500 of its patents in exchange for $22 million. This case dates back to 2011, when it acquired two patents formerly owned by Lycos and promptly sued not only Google but AOL, IAC, Gannett, and Target for infringement in Google's AdWords system. The strategy was successful, and in 2012, a court issued a broad ruling in its favor. Google and its advertising partners were ordered to pay a total of around $30 million, plus an ongoing royalty. Microsoft settled its own case with Vringo last year, paying $1 million upfront and licensing its patents. Google's AdWords redesign still used a ""colorful variation"" of the patent In Google's case, the court found that AdWords incorporated an important element of Lycos' original system: a ""long-term value"" calculation, which selected ads based not only on click-through rate but on factors like the overall quality of the page and minimum bid. After the original decision, Google tweaked AdWords to cut the long-term value score from some elements of AdWords and to move the point at which it was calculated, but Jackson determined that this new method was merely a ""colorful variation"" on its predecessor, keeping Google on the hook for damages for as long as it uses the modified system. A jury had suggested Google pay 3.5 percent of a portion of its revenue (the amount found to depend partly on Vringo's patents, or 20.9 percent), but the judge nearly doubled that, awarding a 6.5 percent royalty. That number was raised partly because even if Google didn't necessarily intentionally copy Lycos' system, it redesigned its product in a way that ""clearly"" still infringed the patent. For scale, Google's total advertising revenue in 2012 was over $43 billion, though that's not all through AdWords or earned in the US. This is Google's second patent loss within a week. Last Wednesday, a Texas judge determined that its Android push notification system infringed the patent of a company called SimpleAir, though damages have not yet been set. In both cases, Google chose to go to court rather than settle or pay a licensing fee; now that the Vringo penalty is set, the company tells Ars Technica that it's already appealed this decision.",0.4828359073800286,0.5171640926199714,0.6758378440508399,475,4.9621052631578948,272,5.7610294117647056,0,0,"Policy & Law, US & World",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

Whether we're speaking broadly about The Hobbit or cynically about Peter Jackson's The Hobbit film trilogy is intentionally open for interpretation. In either case, one superfan did the time-crunched world a favor by condensing the three films (An Unexpected Journey, The Desolation of Smaug, and The Battle of Five Armies) into one four-and-a-half-hour supercut. So what did the (currently anonymous) editor nix? In addition to excising small ""filler scenes"" and trimming action sequences, a lot of the Lord of the Rings callbacks — by which I mean extraneous side stories involving Saruman and Galadriel — are gone. Old Bilbo doesn't appear at the beginning so the story plays out linearly (vs. one long flashback). And the Tauriel / Legolas / Kili love triangle is gone completely, with Legolas demoted to a brief cameo. As the editor notes, that made the barrel ride particularly hard to recut since Legolas / Tauriel were a big presence in the original version. Here's the recut scene:  ""My main goals in undertaking this edit were to re-centre the story on Bilbo, and to have the narrative move at a much brisker pace (though not so fast that the audience lost grasp of what was going on),"" the editor writes in the accompanying post, which outlines even more tweaks. I have a soft spot for fan recuts. Seeing people care enough to spend the time and energy to put their own spin on a narrative is proof just how artistically important the editing process can be. Sometimes it's putting the Marvel movies in chronological order. Sometimes it's Steven Soderbergh having downtime on a weekend. Sometime it's Star Wars. Actually, more often than not, it's Star Wars.

Though The Interview is still performing well digitally, its sales are clearly tapering off. The film took in over $30 million during its first two weeks, meaning these last two weeks represent a huge dip. Nonetheless, Sony seems to be happy with it. ""We always said that we would get the movie to the greatest audience possible,"" Sony Pictures CEO Michael Lynton says in a statement. ""Achieving over $40 million in digital sales is a significant milestone.""  ""Achieving over $40 million in digital sales is a significant milestone."" Lynton's right, even if it isn't going to make The Interview hugely profitable. The Interview is easily the highest profile film to ever receive a simultaneous release on-demand and in theaters, and it's likely going to be the highest profile film to do so for a while. The results are encouraging — clearly a film can find success through an immediate VOD release — but they're hardly good enough to convince studios to start eschewing theatrical windows altogether. Plus, The Interview unintentionally received a global marketing push that it's going to be impossible for any other studio to recreate. The Interview has also taken in around $6 million through its limited theatrical release, which means that the film has likely now broken even on its reported $44 million production budget. Still, Variety reports that Sony spent around $75 million in total on the movie once you factor in marketing and other costs, so there's still a large amount of money that it'll take a while for The Interview to account for. Sony is now quickly bringing The Interview to DVD and Blu-ray, which should let the studio tap into home video sales while the film is still somewhat fresh off of its eventful release. The film is unlikely to ever do as well as it would have with a traditional release in theaters, but even with declining digital sales, it's clear that Sony has come far from a total loss.",0.5792500913334564,0.4207499086665436,0.1748530906897067,360,4.9027777777777777,198,5.6464646464646462,0,0,"Culture, Entertainment",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

I know you can get 50-megapixel sensors, hybrid viewfinders, and see-in-the-dark video capabilities, and I know it’s easier than ever to share the stunning results. But there’s one thing these cameras just don’t do: produce a physical product right there on the spot. For that, you need instant film. And while that used to mean digging your parents’ Polaroid out of the loft, these days you can go for something newer. If you do, that’ll probably mean going for something that shoots Fujifilm’s Instax format. Most of the cameras that use Instax are cheap, toy-like devices, but Fujifilm itself raised the bar last year with the gorgeous Mini 90, an instant camera that took cues from the company’s premium X-series digital line. And now there’s a new competitor from a formidable source. Lomography is the first word in mainstream film photography these days. It’s one of the few companies still designing and selling new film cameras at a large scale, and it has stores and fans all over the world. The prospect of a Lomography Instax camera, then, is an intriguing one, and the resulting product — the Lomo Instant  — seems such an obvious hit that it’s no wonder the project raised over $1 million on Kickstarter. The Lomo Instant has multiple lenses, manual controls, and Lomography’s unparalleled pedigree of making film photography fun, all at a lower price than the Mini 90. But the battle between the two turns out to be more complex. The Lomo Instant is a big, boxy thing. With its sharp angles, protruding lens, and couple of inches’ width on the Mini 90, it’s not the sort of camera you can toss into a bag and forget about. But I like the design overall — it’s clean and attractive, and most of the controls are tucked away in a sensible place. While the Mini 90 has a row of electronic buttons and a simple LCD display, the Lomo Instant relies entirely on physical controls. There’s a manual focus lever to extend or retract the lens, switches for features like bulb mode and multiple exposure, and the shutter is a chunky slider with a satisfying click. I’m not really a fan of the aperture-adjusting wheel, though — for some reason it only locks into place when the camera is switched on, and I often found myself having to reset it to avoid accidentally under- or over-exposing photos. You can buy the Lomo Instant by itself for $119 or in a set with three lens converters for $149.  I’d recommend splurging on the converters — the extra optical options really expand what you can do with this camera. There’s a fisheye, a macro, and a 35mm-equivalent ""portrait"" lens, and all have their uses. The fisheye gives a distorted, ultra-wide view of the world or party around you rendered in a cramped circle. The macro lens doesn’t get all that close and it’s hard to judge precise framing and focus, but it’s a useful addition for shooting food and flowers. And while 35mm isn’t a classic portrait focal length, I actually prefer that adapter to the standard 27mm lens for normal use. The angle is a little tighter, so it’s better for highlighting one or two subjects in the tiny Instax frame. One problem with these lens attachments is that they make the optical viewfinder less accurate; it’s otherwise easier to see through than the Mini 90, but unlike Fujifilm’s camera you don’t get clear frame lines. There are a lot of reasons to prefer the Lomo Instant over the Mini 90, then. But there’s one reason to go the other way, and you might consider it kind of a big one: image quality. In my experience, Fujifilm’s camera simply takes better photos most of the time. Now, ""better"" is a loaded term. No one buys Lomography cameras for sharp and accurate photos to rival a DSLR; the quirks and flaws are part of the appeal. And the Lomo Instant isn’t necessarily any different, especially if you experiment with some its more esoteric features. But ultimately, the Mini 90 is better at handling exposure, particularly in low light. Often the Lomo Instant’s flash will blow out all detail in the subject’s face while obscuring the background in shadow, while the Mini 90’s auto modes do a great job of rendering both at the same time. It’s possible to mitigate this — try dialing the aperture down a notch while using the flash on your subject in combination with a long exposure for the surroundings — but it’s not intuitive. You always have to think about what you’re doing with the Lomo Instant. Or do you? Given the not inconsiderable cost of instant film, the point-and-shoot reliability of the Mini 90 will be a major advantage for many. But if you’re into the impulsive, reckless philosophy of Lomography, you might find the Lomo Instant more to your liking. If all you want out of an instant camera is a bunch of quirky mementos that were fun to shoot, you’ll be happy here. It’s not like it takes worse photos than a Diana, and the film is certainly more convenient to ""develop."" I get what Lomography was going for with the Lomo Instant, and I think a lot of people will like it. It’s a blast to use, and it sets itself apart from every other modern instant camera with its hands-on control and extra lenses. But when I was using it, I couldn’t help thinking of my favorite Lomography camera, which is also one of my favorite cameras ever: the iconic LC-A+, whose forerunner birthed the entire Lomography company. That camera has an amazing, simple, and reliable automatic exposure system: you just hold the shutter down until it clicks a second time once the exact amount of light for a perfect exposure has been captured. It gives unique and beautiful results with minimal effort while allowing for extra creative control if you need it. The Lomo Instant is creatively satisfying, but demands some work That feels like it would have been the right approach for an instant camera, where the number of photos you take is likely to be even more limited than with 35mm film. It’s almost the approach taken by Fujifilm with the Mini 90, although that camera’s heavy reliance on automatic exposure and the realities of Instax film mean that it takes much less dramatic photos than an LC-A+. The Lomo Instant, meanwhile, demands you to put some work in for conventionally great shots, lest its powerful flash blow out your memories. Lomography fans and anyone else used to shooting film in 2015 will probably relish the challenge and rewards — the Lomo Instant is hands-on and creatively satisfying. But if you’re expecting digital-level reliability, you’ll be better off with Fujifilm’s Mini 90. Whichever way you go, I’m just glad that instant film’s surprising revival is enough of a thing today to support different kinds of shooters.",0.6442655373984283,0.3557344626015717,0.14970839345839346,1177,4.8156329651656753,565,6.0920353982300881,0,16,"Photography, Tech, Report",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The Strava and MapMyRide integration follows the addition of a Bike Tile that came in February and lets users share their tracked rides to those networks. The new insights are visible on the Microsoft Health Web Dashboard, a website that lets users review their activity captured by the band. The Health platform can now provide comparisons with an average of other users based on height and weight, so owners can easily see how they stack up. (Microsoft notes that this data is anonymized and is used in an opt-in program, so those concerned about privacy issues can choose not to participate.) The website will also show users how well their body is restoring overnight during sleep and their fitness improvements over time. Microsoft says that the Band is now capable of measuring VO2 Max, the maximum volume of oxygen used during an exercise, based on heart rate information. And the system can now analyze what day and time of day workouts are most effective for each user, so Band wearers can plan their exercise routines accordingly. The Health dashboard will now tell you the best day and time to work out In addition to the new app integrations and fitness insights, Microsoft says that the Microsoft Health app for Android, iOS, and Windows Phone will soon be updated to support the step-counting sensors already present in many smartphones. Users will then be able to take advantage of the Health platform's insights and analysis without having to purchase a Band to do so. While these additions aren't massive and don't address many of the hardware issues with the Microsoft Band, they do show that the company is committed to making this more of a platform than a single product, and it's open to working with other providers in this industry. Microsoft Health still doesn't integrate with Apple's HealthKit or Google's Fit platforms, two other major fitness platforms that promise many of the same things, but Matt Barlow, Microsoft's general manager of new devices, says the company is certainly open to working with any service or device.

Phone calls may have fallen out of fashion, but Americans still make 1 billion of them every day. And yet the experience of making a call isn’t all that great: phones don’t always recognize numbers, contacts can be difficult to manage, and they rarely take advantage of newer technologies like Wi-Fi calling. Now Facebook is introducing an app designed to fix that: Hello, an Android-only dialer app that seeks to modernize phone calls while also working to put Facebook at the center of all your communications. Among other features, it lets you more easily make free calls over Wi-Fi. Hello, which is available in the Google Play store as a free download, replaces the native Android dialer with a significantly more Facebook-centric version. The company is touting three key features: it uses Facebook to identify callers so you know who’s calling, even if you haven’t stored their contact information; it makes it easy to prevent unwanted callers from ringing your phone; and it has a powerful search feature that’s particularly helpful for finding the numbers of local businesses. The app also promotes free calling over Wi-Fi using VoIP, or Voice over Internet Protocol. The feature, which has long been a part of Facebook Messenger, will likely see more use inside a dialer. And if you miss a call, Hello offers you the option of responding using Messenger.   There are dozens of free dialer replacements available for Android, though few have become massively popular. For most, the native dialer is good enough, or at least not worth the bother of replacing. Google’s Hangouts dialer, for example, has fewer than 5 million downloads. But there’s clearly an appetite for apps that replace some aspects of the phone: Viber has more than 100 million downloads on Android, and Skype has more than 500 million. Bringing Facebook back to the core of the operating system Meanwhile, Facebook is still stinging from the failure of Home, its ambitious project to replace the Android homescreen and lockscreen with the News Feed. Home, which appeared to represent the beginnings of a Facebook-centric smartphone operating system, launched with much fanfare in 2013. But users were cool to the idea, and the app topped out at fewer than 5 million downloads. Hello represents a new attempt at bringing Facebook to the core of the operating system. The blue-and-white app uses Google’s Material Design principles, and is organized into four main tabs: recent calls, the dialer, contacts, and settings. When you receive a call from a new number, Facebook attempts to match it with a user profile. If it finds a match, and the user has chosen to let Facebook users find them by their phone number, the person’s face and a miniature profile will pop up on your phone. You’ll see their face, hometown, and whether you have mutual friends, among other info. After the call, you can view additional information, including their email address and a website, if they’ve added one.     Leaked screenshots of Hello from last month indicated the app would include some sort of automatic call blocking. It turns out Hello doesn’t actually block numbers, in the traditional sense. Instead, it simply sends them to voicemail. But Hello crowdsources a list of commonly blocked numbers, and will optionally send any calls from them to voicemail on your behalf. You can also ""block"" any other nuisance number with a single tap. A useful local search engine Hello’s final core feature: a search engine that ties into Facebook’s local listings for easy calls to local businesses. Need a restaurant’s phone number? Just type in the first few letters, and so long as the business has a Facebook page, Hello will surface its address, phone number, and an average star rating from Facebook users. It's a handy feature, but Google has included local search in its dialer since 2013, and it's unclear that Facebook's database of businesses has caught up to Google's quite yet. (Google offers caller ID from businesses, too.) Facebook has no plans to make money from the app directly, says Andrea Vaccari, a product manager at the company. ""Facebook is about making the world more open and connected,"" he says. ""We think it’s core to our mission."" Hello isn’t built to reach the scale of even Messenger — it isn’t likely to ever make it to iOS, given the system-level controls it needs to operate. But by improving on Google’s mediocre contacts app, it could gain a modest following — and give Facebook experience in building more modest mobile utilities.

The disturbing revelation was tempered, however, by reassurances that human-to-human transmission was highly unlikely, and that Chinese health authorities were taking unprecedented measures to monitor and contain the virus. But four weeks later, the situation has changed: 23 people are now dead, and 122 have been infected across several provinces. Officials with the World Health Organization last week warned that the virus is one of ""the most lethal"" they've ever seen, and appears to jump easily from birds to humans.  The progression of this virus, it appears, is still far from over. And experts already warn that bird-borne viruses like H7N9 will continue to emerge from China for the foreseeable future — largely because of a unique combination of ecological and cultural factors that make the country a hotbed for deadly avian influenzas. ""I plainly don't think there is a very good way to prevent these influenzas in the future."" ""We're all puzzled, in the scientific community, with how to handle the dynamics in China,"" Marius Gilbert, PhD, an epidemiologist who specializes in the transmission of avian flu at the Free University of Brussels, told The Verge. ""I plainly don't think there is a very good way to prevent these influenzas in the future."" Two key elements make China a hotbed for new avian influenza: an exceptional density of people living alongside huge numbers of chickens and ducks, and a thriving live-bird market system. And these live-bird markets are not only a cultural norm, but also integral to a great number of local economies. China is home to a diverse array of avian species, including large populations of both domestic and migratory birds living in the same areas. ""Mixing of bird species in small spaces [like markets] provides a great opportunity for the virus to infect different species and to mutate,"" Tanya Graham, PhD, a veterinary pathologist at South Dakota State University, told The Verge. ""Because influenzas are constantly mutating, at some point the virus mutated enough to infect humans."" ""Buy a live bird and take it home to kill and cook."" But those markets, which are ubiquitous in many bustling urban areas, probably aren't going anywhere. ""The cultural norm is the ability to buy a live bird and take it home to kill and cook,"" Graham said. Of course, plenty of other countries, including those in Asia and Africa, and even the US, are also home to live-bird markets. What they don't share with China, experts point out, is the combination of myriad avian species and human beings—all living in cramped quarters. ""People might suggest that unclean conditions or poor hygiene in these markets are to blame,"" Gilbert said. ""But to me, the density is much more important than the conditions under which these animals are farmed and traded."" The potentially deadly impact of this combination has been seen before, namely in H5N1, another China-borne virus that's killed more than 350 people since 2003 alone. Because H5N1 and H7N9 seem to share similar origins, investigators including Gilbert are already using maps of the H5N1 trajectory to anticipate where H7N9 might turn up next. ""The spectre of rapid worldwide transmission."" ""The same places we found high risk of H5N1 spreading, we're finding a high risk with H7N9—because the root causes are [much] the same,"" he said. One hypothetical map, published in Nature, warns that the ""epicenter of current H7N9 outbreaks"" is also a major locus of global airport traffic, raising the spectre of rapid worldwide transmission if the virus does indeed start jumping between people. ""If individuals can infect one another, this virus will spread around the world in a matter of days,"" Gilbert said. ""It would be extremely hard, if not impossible, to stop that."" For now, public health experts are hustling to unravel the H7N9 virus, confirm its origins, and track its spread—a notably tricky project, because birds infected with H7N9 don't show any symptoms, meaning the virus is tough to accurately keep tabs on. Health authorities are also developing an H7N9 vaccine, though it's likely still six weeks from completion. Whether or not H7N9 morphs into a global health concern remains to be seen. Regardless, its origins in the markets and farms of China might not be so easy to change—portending the emergence of novel, new viruses in the years to come. ""There are a lot of farmers, there are a lot of people in this industry, and there is a [dynamic] of wildlife you can't really change,"" Gilbert said. ""We can make all the recommendations we want, but the ones that might be most effective? I just don't think they'd be implementable.""",0.8727939975232737,0.1272060024767263,0.838335467052928,815,5.0638036809815947,446,6.1704035874439462,0,0,"Science, Report",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

A plan to replace the shuttle by paying for rides on commercial spacecraft from SpaceX, Boeing or several other private companies has been delayed from its original 2015 anticipated start date due to budget cuts, NASA announced today. Instead, NASA has extended a contract with the Russian Space Agency (Roscosmos), paying another $424 million to allow US astronauts to fly aboard Russian Soyuz spacecraft through 2016, and to return them or provide rescue services through 2017. That comes out to about $70 million per seat, while SpaceX estimates it will be able to fly astronauts at a cost of $20 million per seat.  ""Unacceptable that we don't currently have an American capability."" Although this type of contract extension with Russia is far from new (NASA has signed extensions for Russian space transportation services several times since the original contract was inked in 2009), the move is a blow to NASA and its commercial crew partners.

That's a $300 million increase from funding approved in fiscal year 2013, but closer to the $850 million NASA originally asked for.

""It's a dangerous thing for Congress, or anybody else, to be trying to specify in detail what types of fundamental research NSF should be funding."" This language may seem reasonable enough—it echoes the 1950 law that founded the NSF—but Science's Jeffrey Mervis writes that the bill ""in effect, would replace peer review at the National Science Foundation."" Currently, NSF research grants are approved by peer scientists judging proposals on just two criteria: their intellectual merit and their broader impact on the science community, as well as in the world at large. Smith's proposal would alter the mission of the NSF, the principal funding source for pure scientific research in the US, by making each project fulfill the agency's aggregate goals. It opens up any project (and the director who approved it) to political scrutiny on that basis. Finally, the prohibition against duplicating current research makes the NSF pick winners and losers, rather than allowing multiple researchers to work toward the same goals with different degrees of success. To see how these changes would affect federal science research, consider what's already happened during Smith's tenure as committee chair. Under a rider to a spending bill passed this year, the NSF is already prohibited from funding political science research unless it promotes economic development or national security. At hearings on the National Science budget two weeks ago, Smith questioned the acting NSF director and presidential science advisors about the merit of specific research projects, arguing that the NSF should require that funded research ""benefit Americans."" In response to a later question, presidential science advisor John Holdren countered that ""it's a dangerous thing for Congress, or anybody else, to be trying to specify in detail what types of fundamental research NSF should be funding."" ""Representative Smith's view of the world is flawed. He seems to believe that legislation of this sort is the answer to large, difficult problems."" Smith followed the hearings by asking acting NSF director Cora Marrett to defend five specific projects in detail. In response, the ranking Democrat on the science committee, Eddie Bernice Johnson, wrote a letter to Smith arguing that ""the moment you compromise both the merit review process and the basic research mission of NSF is the moment you undo everything that has enabled NSF to contribute so profoundly to our national health, prosperity, and welfare."" On his blog, chemist Derek Lowe takes a more cynical view, writing that ""people will rewrite their grant applications in order to make them look attractive under whatever rules apply—which, naturally, is how it's always worked."" Pointing to Smith's work on SOPA, Lowe argues that ""Rep. Smith's view of the world is flawed. He seems to believe that legislation of this sort is the answer to large, difficult problems."" Update: On Monday, President Barack Obama appeared to address this controversy directly in his remarks for the 150th anniversary of the National Academy of Sciences: One of the things that I've tried to do over these last four years and will continue to do over the next four years is to make sure that we are promoting the integrity of our scientific process; that not just in the physical and life sciences, but also in fields like psychology and anthropology and economics and political science — all of which are sciences because scholars develop and test hypotheses and subject them to peer review — but in all the sciences, we’ve got to make sure that we are supporting the idea that they’re not subject to politics, that they’re not skewed by an agenda, that, as I said before, we make sure that we go where the evidence leads us. And that’s why we’ve got to keep investing in these sciences. And what’s true of all sciences is that in order for us to maintain our edge, we’ve got to protect our rigorous peer review system and ensure that we only fund proposals that promise the biggest bang for taxpayer dollars. And I will keep working to make sure that our scientific research does not fall victim to political maneuvers or agendas that in some ways would impact on the integrity of the scientific process. That’s what’s going to maintain our standards of scientific excellence for years to come.",0.630264162531366,0.36973583746863403,0.860541813567759,847,5.2656434474616294,428,6.3668224299065423,0,0,"Policy & Law, Science",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The dress in question was posted on Tumblr earlier today by user swiked, who noted that her friends were unable to agree from a picture whether the frilly number was white and gold, or black and blue. They were, in swiked's words, ""freaking the fuck out."" Discussion quickly leapt to Twitter. Some users quickly made up their minds, their reality locked in place by their first viewing. it’s blue and black bye  Others saw the dress change in front of their eyes, from blue with black bands, to white with bands of gold. And some users, angry and confused by a world in which colors could change at will, invented elaborate explanations to cushion their mental falls. I am glad everybody mutually agreed to troll each other about the color of a dress. You are all wonderful liars. Now whatever I don't even.  The internet needed an explanation for The Dress. Buzzfeed collected the evidence, but it was inconclusive. Computerized color correction could prove that the garment was either bright white with gleaming gold bands, or dark blue with bands as black as midnight. It turned, instead, to the source of the nightmare — the dress itself. It found what appeared to be the same item on sale at Roman clothing, a body-hugging creation in a very distinctive dark blue. But still, the internet wasn't sated. Other dresses could be dark blue, sure, but why was this cursed dress, born to be blue, appearing as white? So we did what we do when we need an answer to one of life's mysteries — we consulted celebrities. But even our brightest minds were defeated by The Dress. I don't understand this odd dress debate and I feel like it's a trick somehow.  I'm confused and scared. PS it's OBVIOUSLY BLUE AND BLACK  What color is that dress? I see white & gold. Kanye sees black & blue, who is color blind?  If that's not White and Gold the universe is falling apart. Seriously what is happening????  So we turned instead to our other gods: brands. Adobe tried to explain the situation; Sesame Street just mocked us.

Xkcd weighed in on the science side, with the comic below illustrating how the ""different"" colors people are seeing could be the result of a white-balance optical illusion. Essentially, this is when our eyes are tricked by the context of what we're looking at — a similar thing is happening in the famous 'checker shadow illusion.' And if you don't believe the colors on the two dresses above are the same, try opening up the comic in an image editor of your choice and use the color picker. They. Are. Identical. However, what physics doesn't explain is why on Earth the internet has reacted in such an overwhelming way to the color of a dress. Perhaps it's to do with truth itself — if our eyes tell us something is blue when more than half of humanity sees it as white, how can we trust our understanding of existence? Or maybe, just maybe, The Dress is super-haunted or something. ",0.6017198457672953,0.3982801542327047,0.4845447890219838,673,4.6968796433878159,374,5.9197860962566846,1,2,,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Even though the text of the speech is still under wraps, White House officials and insiders have given us a preview of the big issues the president will cover. White House senior advisor Dan Pfeiffer described the thrust of the address as ""opportunity, action, and optimism,"" promising that Obama will ""lay out a set of real, concrete, practical proposals to grow the economy, strengthen the middle class, and empower all who hope to join it."" While the speech is expected to focus particularly on income inequality, a lot of other threads from past years need to be tugged into 2014. The State of the Union won’t precisely be a turning point or a fresh start for Obama, but it will tell us where the White House will be focusing its efforts in the coming year, and where it will put pressure on Congress. It’s also a chance for the Democratic White House and GOP — which will respond with a speech by Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-WA) — to compete for credibility and attention. Like last year, a State of the Union hub will feature an ""enhanced"" version of the address with charts and data backing up Obama’s claims. And even if we haven’t seen a dubstep trailer yet, the White House is still making every effort to show its pop culture savvy: it’s following up tomorrow with a West Wing-inspired ""Big Block of Cheese Day,"" where senior advisors will answer questions posted to Twitter, Vine, Instagram, Google+, and Facebook. Healthcare.gov's partial recovery could be presented as a success story Obama’s proposals today are supposed to lean heavily on executive orders that let him bypass a deadlocked Congress. ""The president is going to exercise his authority,"" said press secretary Jay Carney in a press briefing. ""He’s going to use his pen and his phone to advance an agenda that is focused squarely on expanding opportunity."" Last year, Obama introduced a cybersecurity executive order, which Congress followed up by reintroducing the hugely controversial but long-stalled CISPA bill. He also promised action on environmental regulations, saying that if Congress didn’t act, he would: nine months later, the EPA announced tighter pollution restrictions for newly built coal plants. Today, the White House has already announced an executive order raising the minimum wage for federal contractors to $10.10 an hour, following up on a promise from last year’s State of the Union. While these executive orders can move Obama’s policies forward, they can’t go as far as an actual bill would, and Congress will still end up shaping much of the agenda he presents tonight — if it gets around to passing any of it at all. A Google Hangouts interview in 2012. (White House / Flickr) Health care could be a major talking point during the address, with Obama framing the rocky launch and recent reform of the Healthcare.gov insurance market, which was unveiled in October to massive user overload and immediate technical problems, as a provisional victory. The site has come a long way: as of December, it was working for 80 percent of users, with 2.1 million enrollments counted by the end of the year. That’s still far below its target of 3.3 million, though, and the White House is still looking for ways to guarantee the system won’t relapse, having ditched the contractor who originally designed it and extended the signup deadline for people with pre-existing conditions from January 31st to March 15th. Obama has already laid out reforms for NSA surveillance One of the most contentious topics of the new year has been surveillance reform, both inside and outside the US, but new developments seem unlikely. Obama already laid out a set of proposed changes in a speech earlier this month, promising to add more limits to the NSA’s phone record collection and scrutinize its decisions more carefully. Unfortunately for him, that hasn’t stemmed the tide of new information from Edward Snowden’s stash of documents. Like last year, we’ll probably at least see a short mention of balancing national security and civil liberties, with the possibility of more specific details as part of his statements on foreign policy. But either way, we’re going to be waiting until the end of March for the intelligence community to issue its response to his plan. Net neutrality was one of Obama’s original campaign promises, but a court ruled that the policies his FCC established were unenforceable in mid-January. Obama has promised he’s committed to working with the agency, private companies, and Congress to preserve the ""free and open internet,"" but as far as we know he and the FCC are both still weighing their options, with the commission's chair, Tom Wheeler, suggesting he’ll use the limited authority that the court gave him rather than push for larger structural changes. A return to Detroit Rhetorically, we’ll probably see a return to one of last year’s themes: a modern-day technological renaissance that will capture the drive and optimism of the Space Race and revitalize a stagnant American industrial sector. Tim Cook was invited to the First Lady’s booth in 2013, and Apple was name-checked along with research on the human genome and 3D printing. This year, Michelle Obama has invited Andra Rush, founder of Detroit Manufacturing Systems — a company that started producing car interior parts in 2012 and is described as the ""largest new manufacturing employer"" that the city has seen in decades. Mary Barra, who was named as GM’s CEO last month and is the first woman to lead a global automotive company, will also be in attendance. Both women symbolize a possible new era for Detroit, which filed for bankruptcy in mid-2013. More whimsically, the Obamas invited 16-year-old Joey Hudy, a self-described ""maker"" who entered an air-powered marshmallow cannon in the 2012 White House Science Fair and is now an Intel intern. More orders could be revealed throughout the day, and a few of the First Lady’s guests, chosen to represent a broad spectrum of issues and events from 2013, have yet to be announced. We’ll be watching for any new developments tonight, as well as over the next few days as Congress responds to the president’s proposals.",0.587919509315805,0.41208049068419506,0.8990307045054505,1064,5.0601503759398501,588,6.4115646258503398,0,0,"Policy & Law, US & World, Report",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

(World Economic Forum / Flickr) The Sochi Winter Games are already the most expensive Olympics on record, and they're shaping up to be the most watched, as well — not by spectators or television viewers, but by the Russian government. Amid heightened security concerns and terrorist threats, Russian security forces have constructed a powerful surveillance system designed to monitor the movements and communications of virtually everyone on the ground at Sochi. The aim is to deter attacks and unrest through blanket monitoring, though there are fears that the Kremlin is going too far. ""The Russian secret services are just obsessed by the idea of ... total control,"" says Irina Borogan, an investigative journalist for Moscow-based watchdog Agentura.ru. Last year, Borogan and Agentura editor-in-chief Andrei Soldatov published a series of reports on the surveillance programs that Russia is implementing for the Winter Olympics, which run from February 7th through the 23rd. Their investigation shed light on a security system of remarkable breadth — one capable of gathering not only metadata, but actual phone conversations and internet activity. In an interview with The Guardian, one security expert described the program as ""PRISM on steroids,"" referring to the controversial data-gathering system used by the US National Security Agency (NSA). ""These are the first Olympics in which there's a terrorist threat that's serious."" Terrorism is a major concern at every Olympics, but fears are especially high ahead of the Sochi Games. Islamist insurgent groups in the nearby North Caucasus region have threatened to stage attacks during the games in the hopes of discrediting President Vladimir Putin at his showcase event. ""These are the first Olympics in which there's a terrorist threat that's serious, where terrorist groups have said they want to disrupt the Olympics"" says David Wallechinsky, president of the International Society of Olympic Historians. ""In previous incidents, particularly Munich in 1972, Atlanta in 1996, these were without warning. So this is serious."" In December, two suicide bombers killed 34 people in the city of Volgograd, just 400 miles away from the seaside resort of Sochi. The separatist group Vilayat Dagestan later claimed responsibility for the attack, with two members posting an ominous video online. ""If you hold these Olympics, we will give you a present for the innocent Muslim blood being spilled all around the world,"" the men said, addressing Putin. ""For the tourists who come, there will be a present, too."" A ""ring of steel"" to protect Sochi Russia and other countries are taking the threats seriously. Officials have banned unregistered vehicles from Sochi and plan to deploy some 40,000 police officers and 11,000 closed-circuit cameras throughout the area, more than any Olympics in history. The US, meanwhile, plans to station two Navy warships in the Black Sea as a precautionary move — in the event of an attack, the ships would be used to evacuate Americans — and is sharing counterintelligence with the Russians. Kremlin officials have described their security plan as a ""ring of steel"" that will surround Sochi, while intelligence officers collect data on communications to and from the region. At the core of Russia's surveillance apparatus is the System of Operative-Investigative Measures, or SORM: a nationwide electronic monitoring program capable of intercepting phone calls and messages sent through email or social networks. SORM was first developed in the 1980s under the Soviet KGB, and is now under the purview of the Federal Security Service (FSB).  The headquarters of Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB) in Moscow. (NVO / Wikimedia Commons) Government procurement documents obtained by Soldatov and Borogan reveal that the FSB began upgrading SORM in 2010 to guarantee that it would be ready for the surge of traffic that Sochi will bring. Their investigation, carried out in coordination with Privacy International, Citizen Lab, and the Guardian, uncovered new regulations requiring most internet service providers (ISPs) to modify their Wi-Fi equipment in ways that would give the FSB unfettered access to their networks. The regulations also mandate that all internet traffic be unencrypted, allowing the agency to freely monitor web activity. Other documents show that Rostelecom, Russia's national telecom provider, has installed SORM-compatible deep-packet inspection (DPI) systems on all of its networks, which will allow the FSB to sift through internet traffic based on certain keywords or phrases used in emails, chats, or on social media. All told, Russia has spent some $2 billion on Sochi security alone, including two types of drones that will conduct surveillance from above — an Olympic first. ""To identify a terrorist you need to get intelligence on the ground."" The program is certainly massive, though there are concerns that by focusing so much of its efforts on Sochi, the Russian government could leave other areas open for attack. In an assessment report obtained by the BBC this week, UK officials warned that terrorist attacks ""are very likely to occur"" before or during the Sochi Games, noting that cities like Volgograd and other surrounding areas could be particularly vulnerable. Russian security forces are still looking for a 22-year-old Dagestani widow and suspected suicide bomber who could already be in Sochi. The woman is believed to be a so-called ""black widow,"" a term used to describe the wives of slain insurgents who have been blamed for suicide bombings in the past. Soldatov and Borogan have covered surveillance for years, and believe Russia's Sochi program goes well beyond the realm of counterterrorism. In their reports, they note that the FSB plans to conduct surveillance on athletes, event organizers, and foreign journalists, and that the US State Department has advised travelers to not bring any ""trade secrets, negotiating positions, and other sensitive information"" on their laptops or smartphones. ""To identify a terrorist you need to get intelligence on the ground, not drones or [communications] interception,"" Borogan says. ""Total surveillance on those who might mention the suspicious words like 'explosion' or 'bomb' isn't very helpful here."" ""I never expect privacy when I go to the Olympics."" Dmitry Gorenburg, a senior research scientist and Russia expert at the nonprofit think-tank CNA, says the measures are likely as much about crowd control as they are counterterrorism. Amid widespread outrage over his controversial anti-gay propaganda laws and alleged human rights abuses, Putin last year announced a ban on all public demonstrations during the Olympics. He backtracked earlier this month, though demonstrators will need to receive approval from authorities ahead of time. ""They don't want any embarrassing, big political protests,"" says Gorenburg, who also edits the journal Problems of Post-Communism. ""But they also don't want the equally embarrassing [situation of] having to repress the protests."" Russia's domestic tensions have raised fears among international athletes and spectators, including Wallachinsky, who will be traveling to Sochi this week to do radio commentary. He says it's comforting to know that Russian security will be conducting surveillance on potential terrorists and insurgents, though he adds that lumping journalists and athletes into that group is excessive. Still, after attending 15 Olympic Games, he's grown accustomed to spending time in controlled environs. ""I never expect privacy when I go to the Olympics,"" he says, adding that he felt similar scrutiny from Chinese authorities during the 2008 Summer Games in Beijing.

How well will broadcasters be able to serve their customers without their full six megahertz of spectrum, though? That will be the focus of a new pilot program in Los Angeles, California. In April, 2012, the FCC announced new rules to let two or more TV stations share a single band of spectrum, and today the cellular industry has announced that it has found two volunteers. Pending FCC approval, Los Angeles TV stations KCLS and KJLA will both broadcast their content simultaneously over a single digital stream, trying out a variety of combinations of HD and SD content to figure out how viable spectrum sharing really is. ""There will be no impact to KJLA's and KLCS' viewers during this test."" As you'd expect from an organization which represents the cellular industry, the CTIA already believes the trial will be a success. ""There will be no impact to KJLA's and KLCS' viewers during this test,"" reads the association's press release.

We love the idea of re-fighting the Revolutionary War, reduced from a global superpower to a scrappy band of rebels. In our politics, it can manifest in nasty ways — nothing's more dangerous than a powerful group with a persecution complex — but in fiction, it's what gives us classics like Red Dawn and any number of alien invasion stories. No matter how much we may identify with the conquered, though, we can't seem to imagine actually living as them. And apparently, that's true even in Ridley Scott's well-recieved Amazon pilot adaptation of Philip K. Dick's The Man in the High Castle. No matter how much we want to identify with the conquered, we can't seem to imagine actually living as them Compared to unfilmable fever dreams like Ubik and VALIS, The Man in the High Castle is one of Dick's less mind-bending books. Most of it speculates on a familiar theme: what if the Allies had lost World War II? Two decades after an Axis victory, Germany and Japan each rule half the United States in an uneasy truce, and no one is satisfied by how things turned out. Hitler's impending death has created a power vacuum, the Japanese are well aware that they're not safe from the Nazis' genocidal ambitions, and Americans are either erasing their culture or selling it off piece by piece to kitsch-obsessed Japanese businessmen.   The book is full of bizarre speculative fiction details. Africa has been blasted into a wasteland, the Mediterranean was drained for farmland, and Bob Hope does comedy routines about the Nazis' plans to colonize Mars. They're less interesting, though, than seeing characters — a Japanese trader, a German secret agent, an American antiques dealer — navigate two empires obsessed with racial and national differences. Even the most steadfastly xenophobic American is plagued by doubt and humiliation, half-convinced that the country deserved to lose. Here, resistance doesn't mean fighting a guerrilla war; it means preserving your self-worth in a society in which you've become inferior. By the time things start getting genuinely weird, reality breaking down in true Dickean fashion, we understand just how strange it is for characters to see their world change. Amazon's pilot manages to look as grim as Dick's book feels (despite some early establishing shots of the kind of vaseline-focus steampunk cityscapes that characterize budget-conscious CGI dystopias); everything is fittingly rough, grimy, and cramped. Despite it all, we are assured from the first minutes that America is still fighting. ""My father told me what it was like before the war,"" says fresh-faced rebel Joe Blake, who's found one of Nazi-occupied New York's small pockets of resistance, in the opening scene. ""He said every man was free."" Things get much more complicated, and as in the book, no one is what they seem. The Nazis seem determined to stop the spread of an underground film called The Grasshopper Lies Heavy, which shows a world where America wins the war in preternaturally realistic detail. A young couple is drawn into a plot to distribute it, and Joe Blake begins a mysterious cross-country trip for the resistance. The pilot is telling a different, more comforting story than Philip K. Dick's book Given that large sections of Dick's novel are about Japanese gift etiquette, I Ching divination, and jewelry production, there's no shame in punching up the action, especially if The Man in the High Castle hopes to get a full season order from Amazon. By moving around some plot points, it even seems set to resolve the book's tantalizing cliffhanger ending (Dick tried and failed several times to write a sequel before his death.) But as a result, the pilot is telling a different, more comforting story. The first time we see The Grasshopper Lies Heavy, it's in protagonist Juliana Craine's dingy apartment. ""It shows us winning the war!"" she exclaims, brushing off her boyfriend's insistence that the tapes are only well-produced fiction. ""They look real because they are real."" In our reality, she's right, of course — it's newsreel footage of the Iwo Jima flag, the Japanese surrender, and celebration in Times Square. It's as if she's known all along that the world she's living in is just a contrived ""what-if"" scenario, one that will collapse as soon as the credits roll. She's just been waiting for the evidence. That's a fittingly Dickean idea. But it's far too easily won. We're never forced to contemplate what real loss might look like, the kind of loss that the novel evokes so well. Oppression isn't just about laws and violence, it's about ideas: winners create a ""natural"" order and put themselves at the top of it, making rebellion seem not just difficult but downright nonsensical. Being able to see through these skewed realities isn't just a starting point, it's a journey of its own — and it's one that The Man in the High Castle's pilot, to its detriment, doesn't make us take.",0.6967703658238548,0.30322963417614524,0.8390365358589328,844,4.9881516587677721,500,6.1600000000000001,0,2,"Culture, Entertainment",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

The company is positioning Custom TV as an important step in giving customers more control over the TV they're paying for, which is truly a bizarre stance to hear coming from a mega-corporation like Verizon. ""No other subscription-TV service offers this level of personal control and value to consumers today,"" Verizon said in a press release. Viewers watch an average of 17 channels, according to stats from Nielson, so Verizon has trimmed the base package of Custom TV significantly. But don't confuse it with the cord cutter's dream of paying for TV a la carte; with Custom TV, you're getting a sizable bundle of around 50 channels. Most of the big broadcasters and important networks (like AMC) with plenty that most people are unlikely to watch. The stand-alone TV product is priced at $54.99 per month; a Triple Play package that adds internet and phone service runs higher at $74.99 monthly.  The core package of channels that comes with a Custom TV subscription. ESPN says this isn't allowed under current deal The most interesting thing about Custom TV is one network not included in the base subscription: ESPN. The hugely popular, Disney-owned sports channel has instead been split off into an add-on pack. Custom TV subscribers get to choose two add-on packs at no extra cost each month — and they can be changed every 30 days. ESPN will obviously be a default pick for most, but it's not guaranteed. There are seven Custom TV add-on packs in all: Kids, Pop Culture, Lifestyle, Entertainment, News & Info, Sports, and Sports Plus. The possibility of being completely excluded from FiOS in some homes has drawn ESPN's ire. By divorcing it from the main bundle of channels, Verizon is violating existing agreements between the two companies, ESPN insists. ""Our contracts clearly provide that neither ESPN nor ESPN2 may be distributed in a separate sports package,"" a spokesperson told Recode last week.  Looking at this list, it's not hard to imagine some FiOS customers passing on ESPN altogether. Viewers can pick two add-on packs with their monthly subscription at no cost. Go beyond two, and they cost $10 each. Verizon disagrees. During an earnings call today, CFO Fran Shammo positioned his company as the good guy fighting to give you more flexibility. ""This is a product that the consumer wants,"" he said. ""It’s all about consumer choice. I mean, if you look at the TV bundles today, most people only on average watch 17 channels. So this is a way to give consumers what they want on a choice basis."" On the subject of ESPN, Shammo said, ""We believe that we are allowed to offer these packages under our existing contracts."" He didn't expand beyond that, and it's very likely that the two companies remain deep in negotiation talks. But at least on its face, this rift is a win-win for Verizon. Disney relies on the traditional, lucrative cable setup — which always includes ESPN regardless of your channel package — to subsidize its other channels and maximize their audience. Suddenly, Verizon has thrown a wrench into that model by trying to split cable into smaller packs. That's not to say Custom TV is radically cheaper than prior FiOS plans. You may not save much at all. Also, remember that most people can't even get Verizon FiOS, so it's not like Comcast or Time Warner Cable will be feeling any pressure to follow a similar course and carve up the bundle. But it's an interesting disagreement to witness, however short it may last.",0.5394374584470297,0.4605625415529703,0.18115228407700504,644,4.8385093167701863,375,5.7039999999999997,1,4,"Home, Tech",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Long after the company's crushing Supreme Court defeat and the sale of its assets to TiVo, Aereo has agreed to pay broadcasters $950,000 over copyright claims, bringing a permanent end to their legal war. According to Bloomberg, that money will be directed to ABC and other broadcasters that quickly sued Aereo after the March 2012 launch of its ambitious cloud TV service. Aereo streamed live, over-the-air channels to its customers for a low monthly fee — without the blessing of major networks like NBC, FOX, CBS, and Disney's ABC. A federal bankruptcy court must approve the $950,000 payment before the deal is finalized. In the months since Aereo's demise, some big companies have put a new focus on delivering TV to consumers over the internet without any need for a traditional cable package. Dish launched its Sling Television service at the beginning of this year, and Sony recently followed that with the debut of PlayStation Vue, which streams over 50 channels to subscribers in a few launch markets. HBO has rolled out its stand-alone subscription service, HBO Now, and Apple is said to be working on its own Sling-like internet TV offering.

Like, hundreds of times a day a lot. All of that, which involves turning the screen on and using apps, takes a toll on our battery life. Most phones won't last through the day without needing to be charged, but if you didn't compulsively turn it on every few minutes, they probably would. There have been a number of approaches to help solve this problem — Motorola's Active Display and Nokia's Glance screen both aim to keep you from turning your screen on as often — but if you use an iPhone, you're left turning your screen on an awful lot. Popslate, a new accessory for the iPhone 6 and soon the iPhone 6 Plus, could potentially change that. The $129 Popslate case puts an E Ink display on the back of your iPhone, which can be used to display images and text in a black-and-white format that doesn't drain your phone's battery. It's not unlike having a miniature Amazon Kindle clipped to the back of your smartphone and is very similar to the integrated system used by Russia's YotaPhone.   The Popslate looks a lot like a Mophie-style battery case, but instead of recharging your phone, it talks to it over Bluetooth and displays images that you ""pop"" to the screen on the back. The case itself has an internal battery good for five to seven days and can be recharged with a standard Micro USB cable. But even if the battery dies inside the case, the last image displayed on it will remain there indefinitely, thanks to E Ink's retentive properties. There are a lot of potential use cases for an always-on display on the back of your phone: it could show your agenda, the current weather, recent notifications, a static map, a boarding pass, or even your Starbucks card. Displaying any of those things normally requires turning on your iPhone and waking up the display, but with a case like the Popslate, that's avoided. But the first version of the Popslate, which is shipping now, doesn't quite live up to that potential. While it would be great for the Popslate to automatically update itself based on time of day or your location, right now all you can do is push static images to it from a companion app on the iPhone. You can display screenshots, pictures, or graphics in glorious grayscale, but you have to manually change the image anytime you want to display something different. A button on the side of the Popslate lets you cycle through the last eight images stored on it, but there's no function to automatically rotate through them. (And with the eight-image limit, don't expect to use the Popslate to catch up on your favorite ebooks or your Pocket queue.)   Those limitations won't be in place for long, though. Popslate co-founder Greg Moon tells me that the company plans to roll out a back-end data service that will automatically push new images to the case based on your location, time of day, or other factors. With that capability, the Popslate becomes much more than a decorative piece and can actually be useful in your day-to-day life. Imagine arriving at work and having your day's agenda automatically appear on the back of your phone or seeing the score of your favorite team's game without having to turn on your phone. This functionality is expected to be available in the next couple of months, but Moon wouldn't commit to a firm date. For now, the Popslate is mostly for deocoration — you can display your Instagram images, photos from your camera roll, or choose from a community of images and graphics via the app on the iPhone. But it's easy to see the potential of something like this, especially if it were integrated in a more fashionable or useful case design. It doesn't take a huge leap of logic to see this built into a Mophie-style battery case that not only recharges your phone, but also provides information without having to power your display on. Maybe then we'll get our smartphones to last multiple days between charges. The Popslate is available for order from the company's website starting today, with broader retail availability planned for later this year.",0.6354539371245532,0.3645460628754468,0.19942989547095832,737,4.6824966078697425,367,5.8119891008174385,0,9,"Mobile, Tech",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

""We’ve continued to expand our creative role on the shows,"" Hastings told Bloomberg Business. ""Now we’re taking on ownership and production."" It's a shrewd move for a company who by all indications will be going head to head with HBO for the foreseeable future. While Netflix has grown to near parity with premium cable and network channels when production companies are choosing a home for a TV show, there's always the possibility it could be outbid, even for shows deeply tied to its identity like House of Cards. Ownership takes care of that issue, and will give Netflix additional revenue streams like DVD sales and licensing rights.

It's available as part of an Adobe Creative Cloud subscription — where it's called ""Lightroom CC"" — and as standalone software. But the excitement should be tempered, because the new version is really more of an update than a revolution. It's been almost two years since Lightroom 5 was released, which at the time was a major update to the photo editing program's look and performance. The biggest change in this version of Lightroom is speed. Lightroom 6's performance is based heavily on your computer's GPU and processing power, but Adobe is promising speed increases on most modern machines. Even if you're using a MacBook Pro from four years ago, you'll still see an improvement in the overall performance and the speed of individual tools.   The biggest improvements are found in the rendering speed of the ""exposure"" and ""distort"" tools — changes made with these appeared much faster in the preview build of Lightroom 6 I used. Importing a large batch of images into your Lightroom catalog is also faster, but it still takes long enough that you might want to use the time to walk away from your computer or check Twitter. The new Lightroom is faster, but it still crawls here and there Rendering RAW images still takes some time, though. Lightroom spends a full second or more before you see a fully rendered version of the image you want to edit, so you're still going to want to use another program if you want to quickly inspect the full quality of your images. Adobe has added a few new features, the most notable ones being ""HDR merge"" and ""panorama merge."" While HDR and panorama tools aren't revolutionary, these particular ones generate rich DNG files that can be edited without worrying much about quality loss (as opposed to working like a JPEG, which can degrade quickly). Other features announced today are the addition of facial recognition and finer control over the graduated filter tool. There's also DNG editing support on some devices running Android Lollipop — but only on DNG images taken by phones with that capability. Right now only a few phones can do that, like the OnePlus One and the Nexus 5 or 6. Lightroom 6 screenshotsPreviousNextView full GalleryPreviousNext One other major thing Adobe has done with Lightroom 6 is made library syncing work across all your devices. Smart folders can be created on any device — your laptop, your phone, or your tablet — and they will instantly appear everywhere else. Say you've edited a file on your laptop but forgot to upload it to Dropbox or email it to a client — by the time you walk out the door, you should be able to access that edited file on your phone, where you can flag and review it or share it anywhere you want. With this announcement, Adobe is further stressing the value of its Creative Cloud subscription plan. While you can purchase a stand-alone version of Lightroom 6 for $149, you won't have access to any of the file-syncing features, and you'd have to buy separate licenses for Adobe's other software. A monthly subscription to Creative Cloud, however, gives you access to brand new desktop, mobile, and web versions of Lightroom CC (a nomenclature that Adobe introduced with the most recent version of Photoshop), file-syncing, and other programs like Photoshop.

""Our previous policy was unduly narrow.' The company has updated its policy prohibiting violent threats from covering only ""direct, specific threats of violence against others"" to a new wording that includes ""threats of violence against others or promot[ing] violence against others."" It claims this will give it more scope to stamp out abuse, with the company's director of product management, Shreyas Doshi, commenting: ""Our previous policy was unduly narrow and limited our ability to act on certain kinds of threatening behavior."" Doshi adds that the company is also introducing extra tools to deal with violations, with a new option letting members of staff lock abusive accounts for extended periods of time. This is in addition to existing tools that force users to delete abusive tweets or verify their account with a phone number. ""This [new] option gives us leverage in a variety of contexts, particularly where multiple users begin harassing a particular person or group of people,"" says Doshi. Abusive tweets will be identified using various criteria such as age of the account Twitter is also testing a new feature that will help it identify abusive tweets and ""limit their reach"" on the service. The tool will spot infringing messages based on a number of criteria, such as the age of the account (trolls often start new accounts specifically to abuse or threaten someone) and whether or not a tweet is similar to those previously identified as abusive by moderators. Twitter did not specify what ""[limiting] the reach"" of tweets entails, but as Doshi notes, the product will ""not affect your ability to see content that you’ve explicitly sought out."" This might mean that tweets identified by the new feature do not appear in a user's mentions, but can still be seen on the poster's timeline. Doshi adds that the feature does not identify tweets as abusive merely because they are ""controversial or unpopular.""  A graphic from Twitter shows how being locked out of an account might look to a user. However, it’s clear that there’s no silver bullet for dealing with abuse. Despite Twitter's efforts, opportunities for bad behavior on the site seem to be hardwired. Yesterday, for example, the company announced a new setting allowing people to receive direct messages from anyone, regardless of whether or not they follow them. Twitter touted the feature (turned off by default) as an opportunity for better communication, but many people pointed out that for some users — specifically women and people of color — it was just another invitation for abuse.",0.551570145398985,0.44842985460101503,0.8565197859305093,477,5.1907756813417194,266,6.1917293233082704,0,2,Tech,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

A major clinical trial on what was once deemed a potential blockbuster strategy has been halted by federal researchers, after it was determined that the approach didn't prevent infection among study participants. The trial, which kicked off in 2009 and included around 2,500 participants, set out to evaluate a vaccine called HVTN-505. The vaccine relied on a weakened version of a common cold virus, called Ad5, which operated as a vehicle to carry key HIV genes into the body and prime the immune system to defend against the illness. It's an approach that's been tried unsuccessfully before, namely in a 2007 trial, called STEP, that also ended early.      ""The major message is they were not protected"" In fact, both trials appear to share yet another troubling similarity: participants who received the vaccine appeared slightly more likely to contract HIV than those who received placebo. In this latest trial, 41 participants receiving the vaccine became infected with HIV, compared to 30 in the placebo group. The difference isn't statistically significant, but study leaders said they can't rule out the possibility that this vaccine actually increased an individual's risk of HIV.

In that study, researchers took techniques from the pharmaceutical industry and applied them to biofuel production. Specifically, they created a way to get E. coli to excrete the fuel after it has been created — normally the fuel sticks around and kills the bacteria. “It’s the same idea as milking a cow,” Professor Geoffrey Chang told Ars Technica.

According to Astrid Rosenthal-von der Pütten, you just might. Rosenthal-von der Pütten is a researcher at the University of Duisburg-Essen in Germany, and the author of two recent studies on how humans empathize with machines. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure subjects’ brain activity, she and her colleagues found that participants felt a sense of empathy when seeing a robot subjected to both torture and affection. In some cases, they appeared to treat the onscreen animatron as if it were a human. Rosenthal-von der Pütten says her research was inspired by recent trends in robotic assisted living. Robots have played an increasingly large role in Japanese households, for instance, where both humanoids and animatronic pets serve as companions for the elderly. Manufacturers have also begun designing more empathetic androids, though few studies have examined how humans emotionally respond to this technology.   A tale of love and torture   ""Previous studies did not concentrate on the specific emotional reactions of humans to robots,"" Rosenthal-von der Pütten said in an interview with The Verge. ""They didn't really ask people how they were feeling, or apply objective measures of emotional reactions."" In Rosenthal-von der Pütten's first study, published last year in the International Journal of Social Robotics, subjects watched two short videos involving the Pleo — a small robotic dinosaur made by the now-defunct Ugobe. In one clip, the dinosaur was treated with affection, as an anonymous human hand caressed its neck and body. Each stroke drew purrs of pleasure from the robot, its tail wagging with puppy-like alacrity.    Things took a turn for the grotesque in the second video, as the same hand that had treated the Pleo so tenderly suddenly subjected the dinosaur to a barrage of physical abuse. The robot's head was wrapped in plastic, its body was repeatedly battered, and its neck was strangled with a makeshift noose. The Pleo flailed its limbs helplessly throughout the one-minute clip, roaring and writhing in agony. There was no simulated blood or gore, though the contrast was clear: less Land Before Time, more Pleo Dark Thirty.    After watching each video, the 40 subjects reported feeling significantly stronger negative emotions during the torture clip. Researchers also used sensors to measure each subject's skin conductance levels — a gauge of agitation during emotionally stressful situations — and found that viewers exhibited stronger signs of distress while seeing the Pleo being pummeled. These findings confirmed Rosenthal-von der Pütten's hypothesis that subjects would react with anger and pity to the torture video, as opposed to treating each video with apathy. Such differentiation suggests that humans feel at least some empathy toward lifeless animatrons, but her forthcoming follow-up study addresses far more intriguing questions: how would subjects react when watching both robots and humans subjected to torture, and how would their reactions compare? Brain scans yield curious results To test this, Rosenthal-von der Pütten and her team exposed a different set of participants to the same two Pleo videos, as well as two clips of an anonymous woman being subjected to identical levels of torture and tenderness: a plastic bag and noose in one, demonstrations of warmth and care in the other. (An inanimate green box was treated in the same way, serving as a control measure.) This time around, researchers again gauged the subjects' reactions with fMRI scans, paying particularly close attention to neural activity in the amygdala — the part of the brain responsible for processing emotion. These scans show that subjects felt stronger emotions when they saw the woman tortured, though they exhibited similar brain activity when they watched both humans and robots being treated with affection.   This would suggest, then, that people identify with robots in the same way they do other humans — though there are important caveats to consider. As Rosenthal-von der Pütten notes in her findings, subjects exhibited no significant differences in brain activity when watching either experimental or control videos. Ostensibly, this implies that participants perceived box torture no differently from human or robot abuse, but Rosenthal-von der Pütten speculates that this finding might have to do with flaws in the research protocol itself. One subject, for example, said she felt a sense of sympathy during the violent box video because the torturer seemed to hurt her hand while hitting the object. (For future studies, Rosenthal-von der Pütten said she'll likely replace the human torturer with a disembodied hammer, in order to avoid similar interference.) Still, the researcher emphasizes that her primary focus was the comparison between human and robot interactions, adding that the fMRI scans were supplemented with survey feedback from the participants.  RI-MAN, a Japanese nursing robot It's also hard to say how much could be extrapolated from these results, since Rosenthal-von der Pütten's study only examined initial responses to on-screen stimuli. It remains unclear whether this early sense of empathy would evolve into a deeper emotional bond over an extended period, or whether her results would change if the Pleo had been directly in front of them, rather than on video. Equally uncertain is whether subjects would have the same feelings about more human-like robots. The author says she chose the Pleo because it was relatively inexpensive, and because of its lifelike coos and tag wails. But would people respond in a similar fashion to more human-like robots — or, for that matter, a standard stuffed animal? ""The robots will come."" Rosenthal-von der Pütten acknowledges that there's still plenty of work to do in this area, and she plans to expand upon her research after presenting her latest findings at a London conference this June. Her next step is to examine how people respond to seeing a robot being verbally abused. The idea, she says, is to offer both researchers and manufacturers greater insight into how humans respond to robotic companions, in the hopes that her work may better inform the design and function of future models. And as inconclusive as the field may be right now, she remains convinced that robots will soon play a significant, and increasingly intimate, role in our everyday lives. ""The robots will come,"" she said.

In fact, new research suggests, the center of our planet might be around the same temperature as the sun. In a study published in Science, a team out of the French research agency CEA simulated the dynamics occurring at the center of the Earth. Our planet's core is comprised of crystalline iron, surrounded by a layer of extremely hot liquid. For decades, experts have sought to determine how that iron was impacted by both immense amounts of pressure and this hot outer layer.   Blasting the samples with lasers Preliminary estimates, made in the 1990s, suggested that the iron was around 5,000 degrees Celcius. This latest study, however, used more advanced techniques: first, researchers exposed tiny pieces of solid iron to huge amounts of pressure — all while blasting the samples with lasers to amplify their temperature. From there, they beamed x-rays at the samples, using an approach called diffraction, which allowed experts to accurately gauge the temperature at which the iron morphed from solid to liquid under extreme conditions. Extrapolating on that data, they concluded that given the quantity of pressure exerted on the Earth's iron core, its temperature would be 6,000 degrees (give or take 500). The finding is especially important because the Earth's core is what allows our planet to generate a magnetic field.

This is, after all, the agency that’s trying to lasso an asteroid into orbit around the Moon before 2025. But one group at NASA is focused on a far leaner goal: outsourcing the development of new NASA apps to hackers around the world. Earlier this month, they managed to convince 9,000 people in 44 countries to split up into teams and compete against one another to build software and hardware projects that show off NASA data. The goal is to make apps not only for the public audience, but also that NASA may use internally.  Called the International Space Apps Challenge, the second annual event was the largest ""hackathon"" in world history, according to the agency: Between April 20th and 21st, over 770 submissions poured into NASA’s main Space Apps website. NASA is now combing through these and assembling a panel of judges, and will announce the five global winners in May. ""This is a striking example of what the future of government looks like."" In several cities, participants organized and funded in-person gatherings, with only loose direction from NASA’s Space Apps team. And, as Space Apps’s organizers emphasized, they themselves only spent a few months and $70,000 to get the project off the ground—peanuts for an agency that regularly signs multiyear, multibillion-dollar aerospace contracts. ""This is a striking example of what the future of government looks like,"" said Nicholas Skytland, manager of NASA’s Open Innovation Program, in a phone interview with The Verge. The numbers sound great, but two key questions remain, not only for NASA’s Space Apps contest but for the larger trend of crowdsourcing the agency has embraced: How good are the results? And what do participants think about the process when it’s all said and done? ""They are definitely results NASA will use."" NASA says it’s too early to say which, if any, of the apps developed during this year’s challenge the agency itself will choose to adopt. But at least two of the apps from last year’s hackathon have become staples for NASA's staff. One is an app that converts the obscure image file format VICAR—used by many NASA employees—to PNG format, and the other is a software platform for NASA’s underwater robotic submarines. ""Those are getting heavy rotation at NASA,"" said Sarah Rigdon, the communications leader of the NASA Space Apps Team. ""I can tell you that while the results from this year are still being compiled, they are definitely results NASA will use."" Participants in the Space Apps challenge seem to have bought into the concept of free labor—mostly because they’re enthusiastic about space and appreciate competition for its own sake. ""It was overall so much fun, and crazy, when you realize the space and time difference between participants,"" said Arman Atoyan, who led one team and is the founder of the startup software company X-Tech, based in Yerevan, Armenia. His team built an app, called ""Feel the Moon Gravity,"" that uses NASA data and Microsoft’s Xbox Kinect motion controller to simulate jumping on the surface of the moon.  Atoyan and co.’s app is one of the flashier designs to emerge from the challenge, but it’s in good company: other projects include Sol, a beautifully designed iPhone app from Kansas City company Ingenology, which displays the weather on Earth and Mars; and Inbound, a hardware project that consists of a series of LED lights linked together by an Arduino (an open-source microcontroller) to track the path of solar flares and charged particles from the Sun to the Earth.  ""We heavily focused on simplifying the complex data that NASA provided, trying to make it a bit more abstract and digestible at a glance,"" said Matthew Congrove, a developer at the mobile software company Appcelerator in Mountain View, California, who worked with a few colleagues on the Inbound project. ""I don't think there's anything more simple than showing the Sun, the Earth, and the coronal mass ejections travelling between the two.""  It remains to be seen whether any of these eye-catching apps are among the winners of this year’s challenge, but the fact that they were created by teams of professional developers seems to undermine NASA’s claim that the event was designed for average ""citizens from around the world."" Still, NASA maintains that the overall goal of making its data more accessible was met, both in this and last year’s challenge. ""Making vast reservoirs of data available to the public."" ""Our goal has been to infuse a lot of Open Government's values within NASA,"" said Rigdon. ""Part of the work of the Open Government division has been to make our vast reservoirs of data available to the public."" That NASA Open Government effort extends beyond NASA to other federal agencies. In fact, it was catalyzed by an edict from President Obama himself  in 2009. But NASA has embraced the idea with vigor, and other branches of the agency are already holding their own contests, including one in March of this year that was focused on video game development. As for Space Apps, NASA’s plan to effectively ""gameify"" the development of new apps and hardware seems to have worked out better than the agency could have hoped. Although NASA already produces and commissions many official iOS and Android apps under its own label, the goal with Space Apps was to harness both amateur and professional developers' talent from around the world without forking out for employees. ""When you think about a professional developer's salary, it’s about $75 an hour,"" Skytland said. NASA estimates 60 percent of the participants in Space Apps had professional qualifications, a number Skytland says may have earned the agency about a $14 million return-on-investment. ""Right now, we’re just excited we survived it."" Still, despite its apparent success, the crew of 12 on the Space Apps project aren’t sure whether there will ever be another hackathon. ""Who knows?"" Skytland said about a Space Apps 2014. ""Last year we swore we’d never do anything like this again. Right now, we’re just excited we survived it.""",0.634146249395137,0.365853750604863,0.8418746477147998,1024,5.060546875,533,6.2645403377110691,0,0,"Apps, Science, Report",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The flexible, electrophoretic display — which looks quite similar to the flexible e-paper display LG showed off last year —is able to change shape thanks to shape memory alloy wires beneath the display that contract when a notification is received. The phone's entire body can curl up, or up to three individual corners — so you can set different notifications to trigger different shape changes.    As you can see in the demo video, the MorePhone is hardly ready for prime time — it's little more than a bunch of wiring hooked up to a flexible display, not the kind of product one can put in their pocket or purse. But while it isn't ready for prime time quite yet, the team behind it thinks that shipping products could take advantage of this technology within the next five to 10 years.

It lets them get close to celebrities, step into their worlds, imagine their lives intertwining with their idols'. And it also lets them have sex. Lots and lots of sex. The rise of fan fiction — specifically of the erotic variety — has prompted fan fiction megasite Wattpad to release a free iOS app, called After Dark, to collate its thousands of romance stories. Fifty Shades of Grey started as Twilight fan-fic The app is curated, breaking its mature-rated stories up by content-specific channels such as ""southern romance,"" ""urban,"" and ""panty droppers."" As on Wattpad itself, users can comment and vote through the app, which for now, is only available on the App Store. The app will also feature regular romance stories alongside its fan fiction, but Melissa Shapiro, Wattpad's head of marketing, says it's the celeb-focused stories that drove the app's creation. ""On the heels of the release of Fifty Shades of Grey, interest in mature stories has spiked,"" Shapiro said. The BDSM-centric story was first conceived as a Twilight fan-fic by ""Snowqueen's Icedragon,"" a pen name for writer E. L. James. She said the story was her ""midlife crisis, writ large,"" and featured ""all her fantasies"" — an attempt to inject the fairly chaste vampiric love story with more raunchy sex. Fan fiction is not a new phenomenon. Established writers have set their stories in the worlds of Sherlock Holmes, Cthulhu, and Conan the Barbarian, to name but a few, using characters invented by original authors to tell new stories. But the internet helped the concept grow and develop — now it's got its own genres, tropes, and arcane terminology. It's also growing rapidly in popularity: Wattpad now has more than 40 million monthly users and hosts more than 100 million uploaded stories. Wattpad's app is only available on iOS for now After Dark may also end up hosting the next Fifty Shades of Grey. Publishers and movie studios are increasingly using fan fiction sites such as Wattpad to find new material, with fan-fic author Anna Todd, who received a six-figure publishing deal for her series After, the most recent success story. Todd's story focuses on 18-year-old Tessa, who meets One Direction member Harry Styles and falls in love with him, before having several bouts of carefully described intercourse. Paramount bought the film rights to the series in October. The deal shows fan fiction at something of a transitional stage, popular enough to warrant huge book and movie deals, but still seen as something to hide by some in its community — the 25-year-old Todd hadn't told her husband about her hobby or the huge online following she'd built up, only revealing her secret after being offered a book deal. The release of After Dark is one of fan-fic's largest publishing platforms showing tacit approval for the form's steamier side, erotic offerings that don't define all of fan fiction, but nonetheless — as Fifty Shades of Grey shows — can become incredibly popular.

Both numbers will still have to be reported in bands of 250 or 1000. The new order also institutes a two-year buffer for any new company receiving FISA orders or existing companies receiving a new kind of order, which would give law enforcement a crucial window in which agencies can employ new capabilities before they are revealed to the public. The deal will also apply to phone companies, many of which have recently begun reporting law enforcement requests. ""The public interest... now outweighs the national security concerns."" The order was announced by Attorney General Eric Holder, who described it as a clear result of President Obama's plans for NSA reform, which were announced last week and included plans for broader declassification reviews. Holder said that after examining the issue, his office determined that ""the public interest in disclosing this information now outweighs the national security concerns that required its classification."" The order also comes after numerous court challenges by Google, Apple, and other companies implicated in NSA data collection programs. It remains unclear whether today's order will be enough to satisfy the companies, but the new measures offer significantly more than previous proposals. The attorney general's letter also acknowledges the existence of bulk collection programs like PRISM that would potentially affect every user of a service, and takes the first steps in acknowledging how such programs might be disclosed in the future. According to the Department of Justice, the NSA's bulk internet metadata program has already been shuttered and the bulk collection of phone records is still being transformed according to the President's reform plans, but if some version of the program survives, it would not necessarily be exempt from transparency reports. As the order says in a footnote, the reforms ""will determine the manner in which data about any continued collection of that kind is most appropriately reported."" Apple has already responded to the report, issuing an ""Update on National Security and Law Enforcement Orders,"" which replaces its November report with a more detailed set of numbers in accordance with the new guidelines.

While holograms have been used for entertainment purposes — perhaps most notably to project images of Nate Dogg and Tupac at Coachella festival in 2012 — politicians across the world have also tried to harness the technology. In 2012, Indian politician Narendra Modi broadcast 26 holograms of himself to crowds across the state of Gujarat.

Though the group claims to be hacking in support of Syria's Assad regime, its hacks often range from oddly juvenile announcements (""Exclusive! Justin Bieber to E! online: I’m a gay"") to basic vandalism (""Syrian Electronic Army Was Here""), with the group only occasionally acting in a more seriously disruptive way or obviously in support of Assad. Many of the SEA's hacks have come from fairly basic techniques like phishing, allowing the group to break into these organizations' accounts and websites simply by gaining an employee's username and password. The SEA has done more than basic vandalism on occasion though. After hacking the AP's Twitter account, it published a false tweet about an explosion at the White House. In other instances, it hacked Viber and Tango — two chat apps used by rebels in and around Syria — and claimed it would hand their databases of phone numbers over to the Syrian government.  You can follow along with the SEA's hacks and impact below, from basic blog vandalism to more obvious hacktivism for Assad. In its latest breach of a highly trafficked website, the Syrian Electronic Army has published a database that it says contains login credentials for 1 million users of business publication Forbes.com. Forbes confirmed the attack Friday, but stopped short of saying how many credentials had been compromised. ""Users' email addresses may have been exposed,"" Forbes wrote.

The audience is invited to ask questions. Keys says the SEA, which is credited with targeting media... Yesterday, President Barack Obama posted an article on his Twitter account: ""Science fair nightmare: This #climate change denier is the world's most embarrassing dad,"" he wrote.

As the US moves closer to a military strike against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, the pro-Assad Syrian Electronic Army has made one of its most obvious political statements yet.

The hack was acknowledged by Tango on Saturday, however it only noted that ""some data"" had been accessed.

When the Syrian Electronic Army hijacked The Onion's Twitter account earlier this week, it was tough to tell if it was merely the satirical news site making fun the handful of major news organizations who've been hacked recently, or if it was a genuine victim. Strangely, once The Onion began mocking itself for getting hacked, it was much more clear that, indeed, some hackers had taken over the publication's Twitter profile. Now, The Onion's tech team is explaining what happened.  Posting a fake story on a reputable news source's Twitter feed can lead to momentary public panic, but what happens when you post real grievances to a fake news feed?

Quentin Tarantino is on the warpath. The script for The Hateful Eight, the director's long-rumored followup to the 2012 critical darling Django Unchained, already leaked earlier this month, prompting him to put the film on hold. Gawker Media's Defamer blog soon followed the news by linking to the leaked script last week. Now, Tarantino is suing the company for ""blatant copyright infringement,"" demanding at least $1 million in damages if the case is heard in court. ""Gawker Media has made a business of predatory journalism."" The Hollywood Reporter obtained the full complaint, wherein Tarantino states that Gawker Media ""has made a business of predatory journalism, violating people's rights to make a buck."" However, the company took things too far this time in his view: instead of merely linking out to the news of the leak, Defamer ""crossed the journalistic line"" by, in addition to soliciting readers for access to the screenplay, promoting itself online as the first official source. Implicated in the complaint are AnonFiles.com, which allegedly ignored a DMCA takedown request from Tarantino's lawyers, and eight more unnamed defendants who Tarantino believes were involved in the leak. ""There was nothing newsworthy or journalistic about Gawker Media facilitating and encouraging the public's violation of Plaintiff's copyright in the Screenplay,"" the document reads, ""and its conduct will not shield Gawker Media from liability for their unlawful activity."" While it's way too early to tell who will come out on top, it will be interesting to see how Gawker defends itself if the case reaches court. Yes, Defamer gained access to the script and linked to it, but whether or not linking out to infringing material constitutes copyright infringement on its own is still unresolved under the law. Some legal precedent can be found in the MGM Studios, Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd. Supreme Court case, which held that file-sharing companies could be sued for facilitating copyright infringement. What's more, Tarantino's representation sent DMCA takedown notices — apparently addressed to AnonFiles.com — for the screenplay to be taken down. But, unless Tarantino's people can prove that Gawker itself is hosting the screenplay (which would hurt any safe harbor defense Gawker might have), they may have a hard time stopping the company from arguing itself out of this corner. We've reached out to Gawker for comment. Update: Gawker Editor-in-Chief John Cook responded to the lawsuit this evening, leveling pointed critiques on Tarantino's complaint. In the post, Cook writes that Gawker was not responsible for the leak (they have no idea what AnonFiles is), that Tarantino, rather shrewdly, profited on the heated conversation the leak brought about, and that Defamer ultimately published the story ""because it was news."" Defamer covers what people in Hollywood are talking about. Thanks to Tarantino's shrewd publicity strategy, the leak of The Hateful Eight—and the content of the script—had been widely dissected online and was a topic of heated conversation among Defamer readers. News of the fact that it existed on the internet advanced a story that Tarantino himself had launched, and our publication of the link was a routine and unremarkable component of our job: making people aware of news and information about which they are curious. Cook ends the post stating simply, ""We'll be fighting this one.""",0.5051416611511472,0.4948583388488528,0.6609946894425925,552,5.3478260869565215,326,6.3282208588957056,0,0,"Culture, Entertainment, Policy & Law, US & World",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

The candy-apple-red cars looked ordinary, if a little shinier than normal, but it was what was inside that mattered: LTE connectivity and an in-car app store. ""Today, thanks to Chevrolet, you are finally looking at the connected car,"" she said. Whether it’s in the form of car-friendly apps, smartphone integration, or coordination between your smart appliances at home, the internet is coming to your car. The largely latent time we spend in our cars is gold and automakers, carriers, Google, and Apple are all striking out for the new frontier. In the most profitable scenario, your car would drive itself while you and your passengers spend the entire trip fiddling with apps and using precious wireless data. But since self-driving cars are still at least six years from hitting the road, companies must balance the desire to do more things with your car and the need to keep your focus on driving. ""Any non-driving activity you engage in is a potential distraction and increases your risk of crashing."" ""Distraction occurs any time you take your eyes off the road, your hands off the wheel, and your mind off your primary task: driving safely,"" according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). ""Any non-driving activity you engage in is a potential distraction and increases your risk of crashing."" NHTSA says that even using a phone or GPS unit hands-free with voice commands compromises a driver’s ability to avoid an accident. Driving while texting is six times more dangerous than driving drunk, according to the NHTSA, and a driver who texts is twice as likely to crash. At the same time, more than 800,000 vehicles are being driven by someone using a cell phone at any given moment during daylight hours, according to the NHTSA. While 98 percent of people say texting or emailing while driving is unsafe, 49 percent do it anyway, according to a survey by AT&T. Part of the problem is that driving while using your smartphone lacks the social stigma associated with driving while inebriated. Prior to 1980, drunk driving was considered much more culturally acceptable and was rarely prosecuted in the jurisdictions that actually had laws against it. But thanks to a concerted public education campaign by groups including Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD), most people now know that friends don’t let friends drive drunk. By contrast, my mother recently emailed me a terrifying photo taken from behind her steering wheel with the following message: ""I had a great trip but now I'm driving home in rain, fog, and traffic congestion. Bo-ring!! This is why God created texting while driving!!"" The public education effort is being spearheaded by AT&T, which organized the ""It Can Wait"" campaign that produced the harrowing 30-minute Werner Herzog-directed public service announcement that shows the victims of texting accidents and the distracted drivers who caused them. The other major three carriers, Sprint, Verizon, and T-Mobile have all jumped on board with the campaign, which also buys advertising and does workshops in high schools.  Driving while using your smartphone lacks the social stigma associated with driving while inebriated Chevy’s AppShop is launching with 11 apps in 2014 including TuneIn, which pulls in online radio streams; Glympse, which shares your location in real-time; Vehicle Health, which lets you check your car’s vitals; and even Priceline. These all seem like things a driver would want, but they’re also tempting distractions. Carriers and car makers realize this, which is why most of them try to head off the question about distracted driving before it gets asked. ""If we cannot introduce a feature safely, then we will not introduce it at all. That is our absolute commitment,"" says Alan Batey, an executive vice president at Chevrolet. ""We want our customers to get information quickly, but we want them to focus on driving and focus on the road."" That new focus has filtered down to user-interaction designers, who are now adapting apps like Priceline to make them minimally distracting for drivers. That means voice control, haptic feedback, oversized buttons, basic text, and opting for a series of yes-or-no questions to replace the longer, more complicated prompts used on phones. The NHTSA has issued guidelines to minimize in-car distractions. A glance at the screen should take only two seconds and an entire task should take up to 12 seconds, for example, and certain actions should not be possible unless the car is parked. Some carmakers have designed certain features so that they cannot be used while the car is moving; others have guidelines for how many seconds it should take to process what’s on a screen. But all this is still being debated. The new focus has filtered down to user interaction designers ""People say video should only be in the car in the back seat,"" says Chris Penrose, senior vice president of emerging devices at AT&T. ""I would argue that if you're sitting parked in your car waiting for your children to come out, it would be okay to watch video on the front screen of the car."" User interaction designers are working on gesture recognition that will allow drivers to control apps and information without even speaking. But the best way to maximize safety while increasing the number of things you can do with your car is through prediction, Penrose says. The car may detect that gas is low, for example, and ask if you want to navigate to the closest gas station — reducing what could be a multistep process to a simple yes or no. The logical outcome of this is cars that do all that by themselves. ""There’s a lot of discussion about autonomous vehicles,"" Penrose says. ""Hopefully at some point we all get in the cars and they just drive and you can do whatever you want to do. But until we get to those stages, it’s about making the car smarter to minimize you having to do anything, and then when you do have to do something, making it really simple.""",0.3807122123186753,0.6192877876813248,0.36629528215180457,1045,4.9799043062200958,543,6.1860036832412524,0,0,"Policy & Law, Tech, US & World, Report",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

A spokesperson for XS4ALL has told Tweakers that the block has now been removed, though it will take some time for the DNS changes to propagate fully.

With today's reversal, BREIN will have to pay 326,000 euros in damages to the affected broadband providers.

Film crews began setting up shop there today to begin dressing the location in anticipation of shooting the latest film about Apple's co-founder, reports CNET. The house and its garage served as Apple's early and rather humble beginnings, and were depicted briefly in 2013's film Jobs. In this case, it's for the second, unrelated film, penned by Aaron Sorkin and based off Walter Isaacson's authorized biography of the late technology pioneer. Some of the early adornments spotted in the garage include things like a Bob Dylan poster and an ad for a Braun coffeemaker. The film was set to begin shooting in California sometime this month. A job posting recently spotted by Variety showed that the production company was looking for people who could portray engineers, interns, press, and coffee shop patrons circa the 1980s and 1990s. This latest film has suffered a number of setbacks, including changing hands from Sony Pictures to Universal, as well as reported difficulties finding someone to play Jobs. That spot was ultimately filled by Michael Fassbender, with Slumdog Millionaire's Danny Boyle directing. The other film starred Ashton Kutcher as Jobs, and Josh Gad as Steve Wozniak.

If you want to know what's coming up ahead, we've rounded up the best of this week's new trailers — a number of which come from some pretty big names. Since we didn't run a trailer roundup last Friday, a few of last week's biggest titles are also included. You can see all 15 below.   Here it is, the trailer that spawned a thousand analysis pieces. Age of Ultron's second preview was released this week, and there are more nerdy tidbits than ever to dig into. There will be plenty to read about it before everything is revealed on May 1st.   After some bumpy moments during its production, Ant-Man is finally in the editing room and ready to let us take a look at it. It's hard to say that this is the most exciting Marvel movie trailer that we've ever seen, but we're willing to give it some time — there's Age of Ultron to look forward to first, anyway. Ant-Man will be out July 17th.   Frank Underwood may be where he wants to be, but he still has some serious messes to clean up. Netflix debuted the trailer for House of Cards' third season over the weekend, just over a month ahead of its February 27th premiere. Naturally, you'll be able to see it all that very day if you can find the time.   The closer AMC gets to debuting Better Call Saul, the more it's starting to show of it. This might be the longest trailer yet, and it actually shows us a bit of what Bob Odenkirk's character is like way back in the day. The show premieres on February 8th.   Wondering how the Peanuts gang translates to a 3D movie? This second trailer gives a little bit more of a classic look at Snoopy and Woodstock, and it's hard not to find it all kind of charming. It'll be out much later this year, on November 6th.   This is literally the most ridiculous TV show you may ever see. If you only watch one trailer this week, make it this one. iZombie, which is a real show, will premiere on CW on March 17th.      Every name involved with this show is a reason to check it out: Will Forte writes, stars, and produces, and Chris Miller and Phil Lord — the duo behind The Lego Movie and the Jump Street films — are on board as directors for the pilot. There will apparently be some other actors, but there's no word on whether they'll exist in the present or in flashbacks to the past. The series premieres March 1st.   This isn't a Boyhood spinoff. Director Céline Sciamma makes quiet French films about kids, and her latest is Girlhood, which looks to be just as beautiful. It's about a girl trying to escape from a bad family and school situation who ends up finding a new set of troubles in the process. It's supposed to come out in a limited release January 30th.   Melissa McCarthy is teaming up with director Paul Feig yet again. As a reminder, the duo also worked together for Bridesmaids and The Heat, so their latest, Spy, is definitely going to have some fans looking out for it. Consider this a taste of what the new Ghostbusters might look like. It'll be out May 22nd.   There's not much to look at yet, but any comedy that pairs Tina Fey and Amy Poehler together is bound to be a winner. The film's release is still a long way away — it's targeted for next Christmas.   Joke all you want, the trailers for Fifty Shades of Grey are kind of amazing in all sorts of good and bad ways. A lot of people are going to see this movie, so get ready. It's out on Valentine's Day.   The latest trailer for Chappie shows what it's like for a robot that's just developed artificial intelligence. The film is the latest from District 9 director Neill Blomkamp, and while his last movie, Elysium, wasn't quite as well received, we're definitely looking forward to seeing more of this one. It'll be out on March 6th.   There's not much you need to know here other than that Run All Night stars Liam Neeson as a dude with a gun who has to protect his child. Sound good? Cool. Check it out if you're into that sort of thing. The movie will be out April 17th.   There's a lot to unpack here, but needless to say, Unfriended looks all kinds of crazy. The film takes place largely within a group video chat that someone hacks into to begin threatening a bunch of teens over the way they shamed a friend who later killed herself. It's really intense. It'll be out April 17th.   Syfy released a first look at its upcoming miniseries The Expanse this week, beginning to introduce its extraterrestrial world.

As usual, there are a lot of options here and a lot of big names. The favorite so far appears to be an adaptation of Philip K. Dick's alternate-history Nazi novel The Man in the High Castle, which has Ridley Scott producing. The Civil War drama Point of Honor, is another interesting pilot, with Lost showrunner Cartlon Cuse behind its script. The other immediate standout is The New Yorker Presents, which is a mixture of fiction, documentary, and poetry all mashed up that tries to replicate the experience of reading the magazine. Other debuting pilots include the comedy Salem Rogers, which is about a former supermodel leaving rehab; the dark comedy Mad Dogs, which is an adaptation of the UK series about ""underachieving forty-somethings;"" the dark comedy Cocked, which is about a corporate suit forced to return to his rural home; and the comedy Down Dog, which is about a yoga instructor's life after a breakup. Alongside all of those comedy and drama pilots, Amazon is also debuting six pilots for children's series. This is an area that Netflix has been moving into in a strong way, too, as it's an obvious genre to jump into to make these services more appealing to parents of young kids.",0.5116030072947669,0.48839699270523307,0.5172822495078314,243,4.6954732510288064,160,5.4937500000000004,0,0,"Culture, Entertainment",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Jony Ive never mentions it at any point in this video describing the gold watch's creation. But in a set of photos posted to her website, Beyoncé just proved it exists. And she's not the first person to do so. On two occasions now, high-profile early owners of Cupertino's first smartwatch have been photographed wearing a gold band that's probably worth more than any single possession you own. First it was Karl Lagerfeld; last week, the German fashion designer and creative director at Chanel was seen wearing an Apple Watch Edition with a gold link bracelet. Aside from color, the band appears identical to the link bracelets Apple is currently offering in silver and space black, lending credence to the idea that these are coming from Apple directly. Read next: Read our Apple Watch review. 1st apple watch specially made for KarL !! Amazing !!! Thanks #apple !!!!!! @karllagerfeld A photo posted by Sebastien Jondeau (@bentoub) on Apr 15, 2015 at 9:55am PDT  But Apple's store doesn't sell a gold link bracelet — even if you're buying the Edition, which starts at $10,000. In fact, across all its current configurations, the Apple Watch Edition can't be ordered with any metal bracelet in the box at all. The ""classic"" and ""modern"" leather bands that Apple sells feature clasps and buckles that, like the Edition itself, are crafted from 18-karat gold. The most expensive Apple Watch Edition tops out at $17,000, but it's hard to grasp how much it would cost if you replaced its red modern buckle band with a link bracelet made entirely from gold. On materials alone, the band would be worth more than the Watch Edition's casing. The Verge's Chris Ziegler has one theory; this ultra-luxurious Edition model is quietly being made available to the wealthiest of Apple's customers, but it's intentionally hidden from public view and Apple's promotional materials, perhaps to shield a price tag that could run into the tens and tens of thousands of dollars. Think of it as a secret menu — like ordering a quesarito from Chipotle.   But the other, easier-to-digest explanation is that this is something the public will never be able to buy regardless of a customer's wealth. Apple could simply be gifting the gold band to its celebrity pals (and the company certainly loves Beyoncé) and influential design figures to stir up interest and more publicity as the April 24th launch approaches. Under this scenario, some semblance of fame is likely required, leaving even the filthy rich excluded. Other bands beyond those up for pre-order definitely exist in Apple's design studio; Jony Ive just brought some unannounced and colorful variants of the Sport band to Milan Design Week a few days ago. But the solid gold link bracelet? It's something we've heard nothing about — only seen teases of. Odds are it'll stay that way, but we've reached out to Apple for more details.

Aldebaran Robotics' Nao, a bipedal android that costs around $8,000, is now ""staffing"" UFJ's glitzy flagship branch near Tokyo station. Nao speaks Japanese, English, and Chinese, and is designed to answer inquiries ranging from how to open a bank account to what someone should do if they lose their cash card. Perhaps less usefully, the robot can also dance and act out sports poses. I spent the afternoon talking to Nao after UFJ's closing hours. Nao is somewhat reminiscent of SoftBank’s Pepper — soon to be adopted by rival bank Mizuho — with a similar brand of friendly, neutral cuteness; this isn’t surprising, since Aldebaran is responsible for Pepper’s design as well. Nao is much smaller than Pepper, standing around two feet tall, but this allows him to be fully bipedal.

He talks in the same chirpy, expressive tones as Pepper, and it’s possible to get a reasonable amount of useful information out of him in Japanese. But his voice recognition is a little glitchy at this stage, often failing to pick up on questions from me and UFJ staff. And, although Nao is meant to speak Chinese and English as well, he’s not quite a polyglot once you get past small talk. ""We need to explain a few things,"" he answered when I asked about opening an account, ""so please bring someone who is capable of speaking Japanese.""  Nao could be of particular use to foreigners in Japan But as with other voice-recognition software like Siri, it’s easy to see Nao getting better with some updates on the server side. And if that happens, the robot could be of particular use to foreigners in Japan. Right now the Japanese banking system is a complex web of confusion for visitors; banks like UFJ don’t allow cash withdrawals with cards from outside the country, for example, which can be a problem since several places still don’t accept card payments. UFJ ATMs will start to accept foreign cards in the future, a company representative tells me, and Nao may prove helpful with the flock of tourists coming to Tokyo for the 2020 Olympics. Still, the rows of tellers and other assistants at UFJ aren’t going to be out of work any time soon. ""They’re not worried,"" the representative tells me when I ask. For now, and for the foreseeable future, Nao is little more than a cute augmentation of existing services.

While the second of these features sounds like a recipe for spam, it's most likely intended to help brands handle customer support on the site. The ability to DM followers, meanwhile, could be useful for taking public disputes to a more private sphere. An update to Twitter's iOS and Android apps also adds a Direct Messages button to user profiles for easier access. Direct Messages is improving, but it's not as good as the likes of Facebook Messenger Twitter says that it's still ""[laying] the foundation for a powerful and engaging messaging experience,"" but many users will be eager for bigger changes than this. These tweaks follow the addition of direct messages between groups of people earlier this year (a sad loss to the fine art of the subtweet), but messaging in private on Twitter remains relatively buggy and feature-poor, especially compared to the likes of Facebook Messenger.

Estimates suggest that malaria, a mosquito-borne illness, kills upwards of 650,000 people each year — with 90 percent of those fatalities occurring in Africa. And counterfeit medication in regions heavily affected by the illness continues to grow more common, with some research indicating that up to one-third of antimalarial drugs in Southeast Asia and Africa are either phony or don't contain enough active ingredients to treat the illness.  Malaria can be deadly within days after symptoms first appear Malaria can be deadly within days after symptoms first appear, making counterfeit drugs all the more dangerous. But weak drugs pose an additional risk: when exposed to small quantities of medication, the malaria parasite can start to develop resistance — exacerbating the illness' spread through a community. All the while, the drugs generate millions in revenue for criminal outfits, who've developed increasingly sophisticated packaging to disguise phonies.

By using these special polymers, Smet is able to manufacture furniture in its original form. He then applies heat to loosen the polymer bonds and uses machines to compress it twenty times its original size. When the owner unboxes it, they apply heat — via an electrical charge — which returns it to its predetermined (and solid) shape. Back in 1969, designer Gaetano Pesce discovered he could vacuum-seal polyurethane foam to fit furniture into flat boxes. Currently, the material is programmed to expand at 70 degrees celsius (158°F), but work has already begun on a chair that requires just 35 degrees celsius (95°F) to expand.

For years, Maya researchers have adhered to one of two theories. Some argue that the pre-Columbian culture developed virtually on its own and free of influence; others believe it was a direct offshoot from the older Olmec civilization — a group that emerged about 3,600 years ago in what’s now the southern Gulf region of Mexico. But Drs. Takeshi Inomata and Daniela Triadan, husband-and-wife anthropologists from the University of Arizona, believe neither theory is totally accurate. In a study published today in the journal Science, the researchers claim that the Maya likely developed under the influence of not just the Olmec, but an array of other cultures, as well. An alternative origin story Inomata and Triadan arrived at this conclusion after spending seven years excavating early ruins at Ceibal, an ancient Maya city located in present-day Guatemala. Anthropologists have cited the city as proof that Maya culture descended from the Olmec, pointing to similar plazas, pyramids, and ceremonial structures found in both Ceibal and nearby La Venta — a coastal city that was once the cultural hub of Olmec civilization. Previous excavations showed that Ceibal's structures were erected well after those in La Venta, lending credence to those who describe the Olmec as the Maya's true ""mother culture."" According to Inomata, though, it's unlikely that the Olmec gave direct rise to their regional successors. Using radiocarbon dating, he and his team found that Ceibal's earliest structures predate La Venta by as many as 200 years, suggesting that the Olmec settlement could not have been the primary influence on Ceibal.  Photo by Takeshi Inomata, University of Arizona As Inomata points out, this evidence doesn't mean that the Maya predate the Olmec, or that their civilization arose within a cultural bubble. In fact, the ceremonial structures he uncovered at Ceibal bear a remarkable resemblance to those from La Venta. The centers of each city were laid out in near-identical fashion; both were oriented northward with the same array of pyramids, platforms, and a central plaza. Inomata also uncovered jade and other precious stones at Ceibal, suggesting that both groups performed similar ritual sacrifices. The most likely explanation, Inomata said, is that Mayan culture developed as part of a broader social movement that unfurled across Mesoamerica — a region extending from central Mexico to Central America — between the years 1500 and 800 BC. ""There’s no such thing as 'Maya' or 'Olmec’ as one solid cultural block,"" Inomata said in an interview with The Verge. ""Instead, it's these cultural interactions among various groups that were most important"" in giving rise to the Maya. According to the researcher, these groups likely included early civilizations living along Mexico's Pacific coast, as well as those who settled in present-day Chiapas, a Mexican state that borders Guatemala. For the Mayans, he says, ""There was not just one origin."" Excavation of Ceibal ruinsPreviousNextView full GalleryPreviousNext The cause of this social shift remains less clear. Inomata speculates that it may have something to do with the rise of maize-based agriculture, which likely created new social structures, or perhaps some sort of political upheaval within the Olmec civilization. The city of San Lorenzo was the Olmec cultural center before La Venta, and this transition — and its resultant power vacuum — may have triggered larger shifts throughout the region. ""This is not just a study about this specific civilization.""   It's also unclear whether Inomata's study will have broader implications for what scientists currently know about the Mayan culture and belief system. Ceibal predates the emergence of both the Maya calendar and system of writing, but in a press conference held Thursday, Inomata acknowledged that the ceremonial structures his team uncovered suggest that earlier Mayans performed rituals similar to those of their predecessors. Whether or not these rituals were predicated upon a calendar system remains unknown. Ultimately, though, Inomata's findings pose questions that extend well beyond the the Maya. ""This is not just a study about this specific civilization,"" Inomata told reporters. ""We also want to think about how human society changed, and how human civilization developed."" ""What we have seen here is that major renovation and change can happen through the interaction of various groups. It doesn’t have to come from powerful political centers.""",0.8318781636304755,0.1681218363695245,0.8686506658607852,754,5.4058355437665782,390,6.5564102564102562,0,0,"Science, Report",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Nicknamed ""dual-pol,"" by weather scientists, the technology gives weather radar units the ability to tell the difference between types of precipitation — rain, snow, or hail — for the first time. It also lets scientists track flying debris kicked up in particularly dangerous storms like tornadoes, and provide advance warning to areas at risk, which the National Weather Service says has it has already done.  a new type of radar wave Image of a dual-pol radar view of tornado debris, courtesy NOAA. Dual-pol technology improves upon older weather radar by incorporating a new type of radar wave. All radar sends out pulses of microwave energy, which run into objects like raindrops and reflect some energy back to the radar detector in the form of a wave. But until now, weather radar has only been able to detect waves coming back in one direction: horizontal. The new dual-pol adds vertical wave detection, allowing scientists to piece together a much more detailed picture of what's actually falling from or flying through the sky. The National Weather Service published the following animated GIF to show off the added capability:   Credit: NOAA/National Weather Service   ""The information we were getting only came from one direction.""

The National Weather Service cited several examples of the technology's life-saving potential, including tracking airborne debris from a dangerous tornado near Jackson, Mississippi in 2012, and successfully forecasting a 2011 dust storm in the Phoenix, Arizona area.

At a conference held this week by the European Space Agency (ESA), researchers suggested various ways to tackle the problem — including harpoons, nets, and junk-busting lasers. The density of space debris has become so severe, recent research has warned, that a disastrous in-orbit collision could occur every five to nine years. And that estimate is ""an optimistic look"" modeled on the assumption that most space agencies comply with an agreement to remove their equipment from orbit within 25 years of mission completion. Most notably, potential collisions threaten to interfere with communication and observation satellites.    An estimated 170 million pieces of cosmic trash So how do you clean up an estimated 170 million pieces of cosmic trash racing through orbit? Some experts, including Thomas Schildknecht, an astronomer who spoke at the ESA conference, suggest deploying a satellite affixed with a net and harpoon to snag unwanted items. Satellites that fire ions in the direction of debris might also succeed in dragging small pieces of junk back towards Earth, and lasers on the ground have the potential to do the same. In the case of bigger objects, it might be necessary to employ ""suicide robots"" that would be sent into orbit on single missions — each one costing an estimated $200 million.  But that's a small price to pay to protect valuable spots in orbit, said Heiner Klinkrad with the ESA. ""Whatever we do is going to be an expensive solution,"" he noted. ""But one has to compare the costs of what we are investing to solve the problem as compared to losing the infrastructure that we have in orbit."" One project, run out of the Swiss Space Center, will soon see ""janitor satellites"" taking on some of the debris. Unfortunately, most other ideas on space junk removal remain speculative — in part because agencies have yet to agree on who'll fork over the money to execute a comprehensive plan.

I was running late to interview Vivek Wadhwa, the author, academic, and long-time advocate for increased diversity in Silicon Valley. Among feminists, Wadhwa recently secured a dubious distinction: the man who won't stop speaking for women in tech. I had decided to meet him face to face to find out why. Our last-minute road trip began with an email Wadhwa sent me earlier that week and ended outside a Starbucks in a strip mall just off Sand Hill Road. The email's subject line was: ""Would you like to discuss why you are so angry with me."" The tone, both paternal and patronizing, was unmistakable. There's a reason female detractors have taken to calling him ""Dadhwa."" There's a reason female detractors have taken to calling him ""Dadhwa"" The email began with a compliment, then asked if I wanted to talk about my ""angry tweets"" by phone. There had been only one tweet. ""This is the top tweet in my feed right now if you search for @wadhwa,"" I wrote, linking to Stanford University's Twitter account, which promised that an upcoming lecture from Wadhwa would provide ""a fresh perspective on diversity."" (Wadhwa is a fellow at the law school.) Stanford's claim to freshness was ballsy considering the growing number of female voices asking Wadhwa to stop speaking on their behalf. The blowback cycle started as a reaction to Newsweek's recent cover story about sexism in Silicon Valley, where Wadhwa described women as ""humble,"" ""practical,"" self-effacing non-""nerds,"" who needed to be reassured they are ""wonderful."" He meant it as praise, but it came across as condescending and facile. @wadhwa especially when women are routinely assumed to not be ""technical"" or ""not one of the nerds""  Critics say he misrepresents women in the industry and, worse, takes up their space on the page. Amelia Greenhall, co-founder of Double Union, a hacker space for women in San Francisco, had laid out the case recently in a widely read blog post. She argued that Wadhwa's role as the go-to quote machine on women in Silicon Valley is self-serving — and that his aggressive dismissal of those who challenged his expertise was hurting the people he claimed to help. ""Vivek seems to interpret such criticism from influential technical women as ‘silencing,'"" she wrote, ""when by appointing himself the unwanted spokesman for women in tech he has kept actual, qualified women's voices from being heard widely in the mainstream media."" Straw men, false flags, psychological projection — you name it, Wadhwa tweeted it. Repeatedly Before I could respond to his first email, Wadhwa sent me another. He had a better idea. Why not come to Stanford, watch him deliver the lecture, and see first-hand whether he really was ""taking away"" the voices of women? The request surprised me. There's nothing out of line about inviting a reporter to cover your talk. But had Wadhwa slept through his own takedown? In the past few weeks, women expressed discomfort with his eagerness to move online criticism offline, followed by an invitation to meet him on campus to discuss it in person. Being scolded, then stage-managed by a stranger while no one else is watching is an invasive and uncomfortable power dynamic. Kelly Ellis, a female software engineer at Medium, sparked discussion about whether this was appropriate in late January after she posted a series of direct messages that Wadhwa sent her on Twitter. In the DMs, he took a public conversation private, expressed his ""disappointment"" in her, invited her to Stanford, then mentioned visiting Stanford again after she declined. ""Please have the courage to post the entire discussion"" @wadhwa (1/2) pic.twitter.com/i9W26bxXf3  ""What you did is not right."" @wadhwa pic.twitter.com/TWZmTFJZX5  The denouncements against Wadhwa were vehement and targeted — and they escalated quickly. But I didn't need to watch Wadhwa perform on campus to know that he had put women on mute. Even if his intentions were good up until the outrage erupted, the proof was in his response. He tried to marginalize and discredit the women who criticized him, and accepted backup from Milo Yiannopoulos, opportunist-in-chief at Gamergate, a movement to harass outspoken women that has been poorly disguised as a fight for ethics in video game journalism. Straw men, false flags, psychological projection — you name it, Wadhwa tweeted it. Repeatedly.  @Nero It has become too easy to label people and malign their characters. People seem to think in 140 characters also. #Sad  I know @wadhwa has been misled about GG in the past but he is a good man and deserves your support. His haters are the same people. That's why I took him up on his offer to meet in person. The aversion to Wadhwa as an ally had been an open secret among women in tech, a gray-area grievance shared mostly off the record  — perhaps because of the need for male allies, perhaps because they didn't want to be scolded for their angry tweets. Only a few women publicly argued that it was time for him to pass the mic. If that secret was out, then I had some questions. @benedictevans @mjb_sf well, it didn't start with vitriol, for years. Then he brought in G*merGate and, well… there you go.  As the van rattled down I-280, Kelsey and I listened to an NPR podcast called TLDR that had become a focal point for the backlash. TLDR initially interviewed Greenhall about her blog post without seeking comment from Wadhwa or fact-checking any claims, neglecting journalistic best practices. He cried ""libel,"" and a new podcast was put up in its place. Over an excruciating 23 minutes, we heard Wadhwa patronize Meredith Haggerty, the show's young female host, and insinuate that his detractors were an ""angry"" mob of randos. When Haggerty asked about Ellis and the DMs, Wadhwa said the problem with social media is that you ""don't know if they're an alias or a real human being,"" adding, ""Have you verified that she’s in software engineering?"" I had to hit pause a few times when Kelsey started talking back to the audio system. Kelsey also works as a software engineer. Hours before, she published a brilliant (I'm biased) post on Medium about how Wadhwa's ""toxic"" brand of advocacy is actually ""damn common"" in the startup world. Villainizing Wadhwa, she argued, risks drawing a false line between good and bad people, obscuring the ways in which we all perpetuate and ""fail to challenge systems of oppression."" Imagine Tweetdeck as a video game played out in the parking lot of a Silicon Valley strip mall The fact that Kelsey's essay on Wadhwa was blowing up while she waited for me in the back of her van (""listening to KMEL and reading my Twitter mentions,"" she later revealed) added to the feeling that we were somewhere between online and real life. Imagine Tweetdeck as a video game played out in the parking lot of a Silicon Valley strip mall. I had to make the right moves. Wadhwa was sitting outside the Starbucks where we were supposed to meet. Neither of us bothered with coffee. He was much more subdued than he sounded on TLDR. Defensive, but not at all combative. My first question was a test: Name five women in tech we should be paying attention to. Given how Wadhwa's self-defense strategy discussed his supporters in aggregate, rather than by name, I wasn't sure if I would get a blank stare. He quickly rattled off seven names and details about their accomplishments. Four of them (Kim Polese, Heidi Roizen, Lynn Tilton, and Megan Smith) are the interview subjects highlighted on the promotional copy for the book Wadhwa co-authored called Innovating Women. We were off to a lukewarm start. The unfortunate effect of TLDR's initial oversight is that more attention has been paid to Greenhall's criticisms that aren't true than to the ones that are. Wadhwa published a point-by-point refutation and has been challenging everyone to fact-check the allegations, but at Starbucks, I found him ill-prepared for that challenge. For example, he repeatedly drew a dichotomy between the angry women whose objections were amplified by social media and a group of ""humble,"" ""low-key"" women around the world who are not on social media and have more serious issues to deal with. There was a gesture that went along with it. On the table between us, he would make a small circle with his hands on the left — symbolizing a tiny group on the margins — versus a big ol' circle with his hands on the right. Wadhwa was ill-prepared for his own fact-checking challenge I have done more for the cause of women in tech than almost anyone. Spoke up before others dared; took intense fire; did what was right  . @wadhwa is following 189 men, 78 orgs, 58 women in Media/journalism, 11 other women, and at most 33 women in tech. Seems very skewed. @MJB_SF you should consider how this looks to people who've never heard of any of you (that is, everyone).  @girlziplocked No frankly I don't. What is wrong with an Indian man speaking about women in tech--when he has interviewed 1000+? ""It's a different crowd than I've been researching,"" Wadhwa explained. I told him that was beside the point. ""But that does matter,"" he interrupted, if you have one set of people saying, ""‘Stop speaking, stop speaking, stop speaking,' and you have another set of people saying ‘Thank you, thank you, thank you.'"" I snapped back: Where in the world were these grateful women saying ""thank you""? Did he think he was doing so much good that women begged him to speak on their behalf? ""I'm speaking for the broader set of women,"" was the only detail he offered. Sounds like a straw-man argument to me, I replied. Why, I asked, wasn't he listening to people like Ellis or Kelsey, who worked in his industry? After the Newsweek article, Ellen Chisa, a former product manager at Kickstarter, looked up who Wadhwa was following ""because he clearly holds a different perspective from me."" Something gave him the impression that these women could be ignored. If he had been paying attention to the conversation about women in tech, these Twitter handles would have been familiar to him. They use social justice warrior tactics because they work. Politeness didn’t get a response from Wadhwa in 2013. Politeness in 2015 was likewise sidelined. On occasion, Wadhwa threw up a shield that he wasn't trying to represent anyone, only his research. His unpopular observation in Newsweek that women undersell themselves? ""I'm sorry, Nitasha, but that's based on research."" Wadhwa also focuses on immigration, where his critique of H1-B visas has helped shape public opinion about Silicon Valley's motivations, as well as the Ray Kurzweil school of futurism as practiced by Singularity University, a for-profit unaccredited institute where he serves as a distinguished fellow. Wadhwa told me his next book is going to be about ""what life will look like in 2025–2030 and the legal and ethical issues."" When it comes to gender, he typically references studies from 2010 and 2014, as well as women from his book. However, Katty Kay and Claire Shipman found a similar pattern in their research for ""The Confidence Gap."" So what research backs up that women are more ""humble"" outside the United States, I asked. ""Well, that is anecdotal, that is my opinion,"" he replied. Another research chimera? When I asked if he used Institutional Review Board (IRB) standards for Innovating Women, Wadhwa said the book was done through Singularity University and Farai Chideya, his co-author. (One good measure of Wadhwa's value for diversity: how often do you hear Farai's name associated with the book?) ""It also wasn't research, it was journalism/reporting...SU doesn't receive government research funds, so no IRB regardless."" I was able to confirm one more disputed fact about donating the proceeds of his book to educational grants for women (through Singularity University). The school's spokesperson told me that $60,000 in initial supporting funds from Wadhwa's Innovating Women were donated to the Singularity University Fund, ""a corporate-advised fund"" at the Silicon Valley Community Foundation. The donation had been allocated to the University's Graduate Studies Program. The funds were used to ""award more GSP seats"" to winners of its 2014 Global Impact Competition for Gender Equality, ""which resulted in three women attending the GSP for free or reduced program fees."" It hasn't been calculated yet, the spokesperson added, but ""net proceeds from book sales will also be donated to the Fund."" Wadhwa was not aware of the latter. He told me to try his publisher, the university, or SVCF, and one of them would know. There were other fact-checking road blocks. Wadhwa mentioned a public spreadsheet created by journalist Glenn Fleishman with the names of women from the book. He claimed the subjects of his book ""felt harassed"" by critics who were ""going around digging up dirt on me"" (also known as journalism). He compared the spreadsheet to Gamergate. Wadhwa's understanding of Gamergate shifts when it's convenient for him. When I asked why he aligned himself with Gamergate, Wadhwa said, ""I don’t even know who these people are, you’ve got to realize."" When I said that that’s a problem, he said: ""Nitasha, Nitasha, I read horror stories about it, and I tweeted my horror at that."" When I asked why he was palling around with @Nero, he said, ""You’re talking about Milo? I’ve known Milo since — I mean Paul Carr introduced me to him when we were at TechCrunch."" All those responses? Within the span of a couple minutes. In any case, he gave me the name of one woman who felt harassed by the spreadsheet: Screenmancer's founder Quendrith Johnson. She said the harassment fears ""did not pertain to her."" However, Johnson staunchly supports Wadhwa and called the case against him ""a tangled mass of vitriol"" with ""competing agendas and misdirected firepower."" Fleishman told me he started the spreadsheet because some of the women listed as ""ambassadors"" had no idea. ""At least two have sworn it off,"" he said. There were other oddities. On TLDR, Wadhwa said that four to five times a week reporters contact him to comment on a story related to women in tech and, instead, he directs them to the aforementioned women. But I had to press him to identify even one of these people who call him four or five times a week. It wasn't until I said it sounded like he couldn't name any that he coughed up an example. That reporter confirmed that Wadhwa directed him to speak to other women, however, the media request came after the controversy. Nina Burleigh, the author of Newsweek's cover story on sexism, couldn't recall and didn't get why this mattered: I had already interviewed dozens of women - many off the record and not appearing in the story, when I called Wadhwa bc I needed a male voice, and his writing seemed interesting. I don't recall whether he suggested I speak to any more women but since I already had talked to at least 30 already I wasn't looking for more. I honestly do not understand the attacks on this man. The world needs more men speaking out on this topic, and there are few enough of them already. If you are interested in pursuing this you should contact Jackson Katz, a prominent male anti rape speaker, writer. There is a movement of pro feminist men out there and it needs to be nurtured not attacked. We're stuck in a debate about amplifying women's voices that revolves around a man From many angles, the fixation on Wadhwa does look futile. We're stuck in a debate about amplifying women's voices that revolves around a man. In order to explain the terms of the debate, the spotlight has to shine back on Wadhwa. And he, in turn, has co-opted terms for abuse that often targets women in order to sideline his female critics. Mary Trigiani, founder of the marketing firm Spada, told TLDR that Wadhwa ""reframes the question as a personal attack towards him and uses words like ‘stalking' and ‘harassing.'"" It's a real Turducken of irony. A Matryoshka doll of absurdity. It is a hot mess. .@wadhwa so what you’re saying is, it’s actually about ethics in journalism  Wadhwa has not helped himself. It's easy to assume that becoming a Twitter target takes its toll. A recent Washington Post investigation showed feminist writers (not in tech) retiring because of the psychic toll of online abuse. In Wadhwa's mind, he's had a few weeks of it, they have been at it for years. But he reacts as badly to one detractor as he does to a dozen. Trigiani was at a Bloomberg conference in January 2014 when he used the term ""token floozies"" and she wanted an explanation. As he did with ""nerds,"" in Newsweek, Wadhwa blamed it on a lack of familiarity with American slang. There is no possible explanation for this epic ""apology"" to Trigiani that gaslights her for having ""personal difficulties"" (this is in the apology) and tells her to ""do your homework"" by reading his articles and familiarizing herself with his expertise. If you can believe it, the letter sounded worse when Wadhwa recounted it at Starbucks. The equivalent this time were those DMs to Ellis. In the initial TLDR episode, Haggerty said DMs were ""the hand on the knee of social media communication."" In the follow-up episode, she stood by the phrase. Probably because it's 2015! Women are starting to build a vocabulary to talk about the gray-area interactions they face online. Managing the expectations of a ""mentions pest,"" for example, is incredibly energy-zapping, but I never had a word for it until Lily Benson's etiquette guide list this month. Wadhwa blames the ""hand on knee"" comment for allegations of sexual harassment and being called a sexual predator, but Wadhwa is the one who keeps bringing it up. Last week was not the first time Wadhwa invited me to Stanford. He offered to meet there once before. I would not classify any of his messages to me as harassment. That was never part of the backchannel conversation. I have, however, found many (many) of his emails to me to be uncomfortably paternalistic. I never called him on it before the meeting, so that's on me. The thing is, when I did, he seemed to get it. Maybe it was the fourth or fifth time I made the same point, but he listened and nodded and thanked me. His mental posture seemed to shift. It was a relief. I wasn't sure how he was going to react when I told him this was an open secret, or that he has made it harder for women to talk about sexual harassment, or that he is out of touch with feminism in tech today. The last one happened when Wadhwa asked me what ""gaslighting"" meant. If he didn't know what gaslighting and Gamergate meant, he had no business speaking for women in tech, I replied, incredulous. ""I can see the stress in your voice,"" he said, with a sympathetic look. It's the parallax of outrage culture Wadhwa started his end of the conversation by trying to explain to me what it was like when he began writing about diversity. It's just my impression, but I remember the tenor of tech blogging then, and I can believe he started down that path with good intentions. He reminded me of Y Combinator founder Paul Graham, a hero to hackers since back when engineers were not the rockstars and ninjas and Jedis and assholes, whose worldview just wasn't as nimble as the startups he invests in. It's the parallax of outrage culture that Kelsey warned about. It's easy to make heroes and villains. There should be a vocabulary for gray areas in this sphere, too. Over and over and over and over again, Wadhwa told me that he was getting out of the diversity game. The only time I believed him was right before we parted ways. What if all of this attention had been paid to women in tech instead, I asked. ""There's nothing I would have liked better,"" he replied. You refocused it on yourself, I shot back. He let out a kind of exclamatory sigh. ""Ah, that's the last thing I wanted to do. The last thing I would have chosen is to be in the middle of this, and frankly, I want to get out of it."" Considering that he was going to get on the phone with one of the biggest newspapers in the country as soon as I walked back to Kelsey's van, I didn't buy it. The next day, Wadhwa sent me another email. ""After reflecting on the things you said, I am going to be announcing that I am exiting the debate."" On Monday, his column for The Washington Post was headlined, ""Why I am stepping out of the debate on women in technology."" ""I got frustrated, and it showed, and the quality of the discussion suffered,"" he acknowledged. ""Today there is a chorus of very powerful, intelligent voices who are speaking from personal experience. The women who I have written about, who have lived the discrimination and abuse, as well as others, deserve the air time."" In classic Wadhwa fashion, the extended cuts of his exit letter posted on his personal blog and on VentureBeat, as well as his accompanying Tweetstorm, swung back to claiming that contributors to his book had been ""harassed"" and implied that TLDR used the phrase ""come sit on my lap,"" as well ""hand on the knee."" We'll see which version of retirement he sticks to.",0.4696357470350385,0.5303642529649615,0.8582208251975785,3659,4.8226291336430718,1523,6.6296782665791198,0,0,"Culture, Tech, Interview",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Schumer dubbed the proposed legislation ""Avonte's law,"" named for Avonte Oquendo. Oquendo, who suffered from severe autism, disappeared from his school in Queens last October. His remains were found in the East River earlier this month. Oquendo's mother, Vanessa Fontaine, stood beside Schumer as he unveiled the proposed legislation on Sunday. The voluntary scheme would see children with autism wearing GPS trackers in belts, shoelaces, or even sewn into clothes. In Oguendo's case, New York police and volunteers had to resort to unconventional methods in an attempt to find the child in a months-long search that included playing his mother's voice from truck-mounted loudspeakers. According to WABC-TV News, the new trackers would reduce the time it takes to find a child by 95 percent. The voluntary program would see children with autism wearing GPS trackers The traits that characterize autism also mean autistic children have an increased chance of getting lost. Studies have shown that children with autism are four times more likely to flee from safe environments such as school or their homes than non-autistic siblings. In 2011, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention designated ""wandering"" as a ""potentially life-threatening"" aspect of autism-spectrum disorders, a danger compounded by the fact that one-third of children with autism are non-verbal and unable to explain their situation or request help. Avonte's law — called ""a great solution"" by Michael Rosen, executive vice president of autism advocacy group Autism Speaks — is modeled after an Alzheimer's program that gives grants to organizations that search for missing patients.

The Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board was conceived in the wake of 9/11, the event we’ve used to justify almost any level of surveillance. For five of its ten years, it hasn’t even been operational. But on Thursday, it came out with perhaps the harshest take yet we’ve seen on the NSA’s phone-record database, drawing a combination of sharp disagreement and immediate disregard from the president. In contrast to the vague promises of reform in Obama’s speech last week, though, the oversight panel’s 238-page report takes direct aim at the problems posed by the bulk collection of phone metadata — even if all it gets is a rhetorical victory. Like Obama’s other NSA review panel, the oversight board made its decision based partly on classified documents, but the report follows a long trickle of disclosures about what the agency really does. Over the past six months, for example, the NSA’s claim that metadata collection foiled 54 terrorist plots has been largely debunked, leaving only a few cases where phone-record searches provided hints. It’s believed to have unmasked precisely one potential terrorist: Basaaly Moalin, who was convicted in 2013 not of planning an attack but of sending money to militant group al-Shabaab. The report says that while there was ""critical value"" in cutting off these funds, it’s telling that over seven years of data collection, Moalin’s case remains the only example of the program getting a lead on a suspect. It even suggests that the FBI may have found the link without the NSA's tip-off, and that the NSA could probably have gotten the same information without the database, even if it took more time. What's proving a negative worth? Over those same years, phone companies inadvertently sent the NSA credit card numbers, the NSA accidentally kept thousands of call-record files for over the five-year limit, and technicians created automated alert lists that sucked in records without authorization, then tried and failed to fix the problem multiple times before shutting down the alerts altogether. Declassified documents so far have only revealed a dozen cases where analysts intentionally misused the database, but accidental violations keep piling up. The report doesn’t say that the program was useless, but it effectively damns it with faint praise. The board agrees that having so much information could let agencies ""triage"" terrorist threats by using the database to quickly hunt down and prioritize leads. It also allows ""negative reporting"" — being able to see every phone communication can let agents know if a terrorist has not been in contact with anyone in the US, whether that’s for peace of mind or to focus resources somewhere else. Has having these options open helped close cases or prevent attacks, though? The worth of peace of mind is difficult to measure. What is easy to point to is the list of plots the program hasn’t foiled. The report compares the database to a security system or insurance policy that could be valuable even if it never goes off. ""Yet, it is worth noting that the program supplied no advance notice of attempted attacks on the New York City subway, the failed Christmas Day airliner bombing, or the failed Times Square car bombing."" Given these failures, it concludes, it’s unlikely to provide ""significant value, much less essential value, in safeguarding the nation in the future."" Image credit: Bobistraveling (Flickr) Obama’s ad-hoc review panel of ""outside experts,"" which released its report back in December, said something similar: the database had never actually disrupted a plot, but it could help confirm where attacks weren’t taking place. Its take, though, proved gentler than that of a committee whose members Obama didn’t even bother to nominate during most of his first term. After the press quoted the December panel report’s conclusion that the program was ""not essential to preventing attacks,"" chair (and former CIA deputy director) Michael Morell followed up with a scathing editorial, saying that the records database could ""prevent the next 9/11"" and ""needs to be successful only once to be invaluable."" The 9/11 claim has been disputed by other members, and the panel explicitly recommended moving information out of a government-owned database, but Morell’s argument stayed at the forefront: the program hasn’t helped before now, but it might help someday, and that’s enough. The program's operation has ""almost no resemblance"" to the law justifying it Morell’s panel punted anything close to a legal question into the realm of the courts. But the oversight board’s biggest finding is that not only is the database almost certainly ineffective, it’s also probably illegal. The program is justified by the Patriot Act’s Section 215, which lets agencies request evidence that’s relevant to a national security investigation. But the panel says the current program ""bears almost no resemblance"" to this description. If a tool like the database is seen as relevant to investigations as a whole, this definition opens the door to any new, more invasive technology. ""The word ‘relevant,’"" the report says, ""becomes limited only by the government’s technological capacity to ingest information and sift through it efficiently."" Defenders have pointed out that Congress knew about the program and voted twice to continue it, but the panel says legislators ""merely postponed the sunset dates"" and often had virtually no information about how the law was actually being used. On a broader level, if Congress signed off on the law, the report says it would still violate the First and Fourth Amendments: collecting the information counts as an unreasonable search, and freedom of speech suffers when the government can theoretically analyze the patterns of almost anyone’s life. Once again, metadata matters. Image credit: Jamiesrabbits (Flickr)  For anyone who’s been frustrated by the slow progress of NSA reform, this is all gratifying to hear. But does it actually mean anything? The White House has already said it believes the board’s opinion is wrong — Obama even got to propose his reforms without a public report castigating their legal basis, insisting that the program was both effective and legal. The intelligence community and attorney general will be coming back in March to present alternatives to the current government database, but they’ll likely make only the most modest changes possible. ""The president has very clearly said that he wants to keep the capability."" Bills like the USA Freedom Act are meant to rein in metadata collection, and Section 215, which authorizes the phone-record collection, will come up for debate next year — it’s set to expire on June 1st, 2015. Any significant changes, though, will meet with heavy opposition. Senate Intelligence Committee Chair Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) quickly shot down the idea that Congress would go much further than Obama on reforms. ""The president has very clearly said that he wants to keep the capability,"" she said on an NBC Meet the Press appearance. ""So I think we would agree with him. I know a dominant majority of the — everybody, virtually, except two or three, on the Senate Intelligence Committee would agree with that."" What the oversight board recommendations can do is help set the tone for these debates and, because the board was given access to more information than the public will ever get, provide meaningful clues about what the NSA can do. But if we’re interested in arguments about how the program is illegal, we should look to Judge Richard Leon, who recently called bulk phone record collection an ""Orwellian"" overreach that was likely unconstitutional. Leon’s opinion is balanced by that of another judge, who ruled in favor of the government in a different trial. Both cases, though, will go to appeals, potentially setting the stage for a Supreme Court showdown. The chances that the judicial branch will crack down on metadata collection are far from certain, but it’s got a better shot than a report that the president decided to ignore before we even got to see it.",0.43885688536933876,0.5611431146306612,0.8417970206452218,1346,5.2615156017830609,709,6.4724964739069115,0,0,"Policy & Law, US & World, Editorial, National Security",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

Hollywood has become adroit at making the everyday feel spectacular and entertaining. 2014's Dawn of the Planet of the Apes was the most fun I've had watching humans and apes repair a dam, while Interstellar somehow kept us rapt through history's longest long-distance flight. But there's one task we humans do every day that even the best directors struggle to film without sending the audience into a trance: computing. Last month I had a chance to see an early screening of Blackhat, the upcoming Michael Mann thriller about a hacker released from prison under a bold promise: find the cyber criminal fomenting global chaos and earn your freedom. The good guy hacker played by Chris Hemsworth, also known as Thor, dwarfs every laptop in the movie; when writing code, his fingers don't tap, they pile drive. Hemsworth's casting, goofy as it looks, charmingly plays against computer nerd stereotypes. His meaty frame can hardly be blamed for the tediousness of watching him or anyone else in the film do glorified office work. According to a report from 2013, the average American spends five hours a day looking at a computer, tablet, or phone and that number is trending upwards. That may explain in small part why it's so tedious to spend another minute watching someone else do the same.  But I suspect a handful of other reasons compound to inspire our disinterest in gazing at impossibly beautiful people typing on all-too-mundane hardware. Hemsworth's casting plays against computer nerd stereotypes Hardware is designed to be operated and enjoyed by a party of one. Our daily experience on the internet requires a bit of imagination, like reading a book, where the two-dimensional representation of the world on our screen becomes a serviceable stand-on for the real world. Which is to say while I'm not working at the office today, programs like Gmail and Slack and Twitter and YouTube make it feel like I kind of, sort of am. The magic mostly happens in my head — not a place you can film. And so film has struggled to capture that sensation of connectivity. Not for lack of trying. Some films take the gutsy move of making the imaginary world inside our computers real, creating a tangible space for the characters to stroll about. The style fits most naturally in films about virtual reality, like The Lawnmower Man. The Matrix had its own memorable take on this, too.   Blackhat uses the more traditional method for signifying the importance of computing: frenetic editing, ultra close-ups, and a hard drive full of computer animation. In the early minutes of the film, an unknown hacker launches an attack on a Chinese nuclear power plant. A keystroke sends the camera through the keyboard's casing, through a jumble of wires, across the motherboard, into the CPU, and over miniature mountains of silicon — at least, I think that's what I saw. It's an action sequence, played out in nano scale on familiar hardware that up close looks alien. The effect is entrancing at first, but much less so the second time. The third time a hacker sits at a computer, the film gives up on the charade, and goes with the de facto shot of men and women brooding at their desk, intercut with close-ups of pixelated monitors. By the second act, most of the computers have been exchanged for guns, so Chris Hemsworth and his crew can start kicking ass in the real world with their perfectly fitted clothes and groomed hair fluttering in the wind. It was always curious for Mann, whose digital photography skillfully captures the beauty of ordinary cosmopolitan office complexes and downtown clubs, to make a movie about computers. The best ""hacking"" scene in the film involves some creative use of a stolen vehicle and disguise — no keyboards required. There are two rules taught on the first day of every film program: ""show, don't tell"" and ""people like watching people."" Blackhat never manages to pat its head and rub its belly at the same time. We're either blasting through the cavernous interior of the computer or watching Thor flex, grimace, and shoot. But it's not the first film to have this problem. There's simply no established way to show what's happening in the real world, on the monitor, and that intangible space between them. I mentioned Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, a film set in a world hungry for electricity. Restoring the dam is visceral and practical, a task with visible results. Once the power returns to the huddle of survivors, a grizzled Gary Oldman turns on his tablet to look at photos of his lost family.

I had reached peak remake saturation.  And then they started coming to television.  At first it seemed more like a cute prequel parlor trick than a trend. Bryan Fuller’s excellent Hannibal took on pre-Silence of the Lambs Hannibal Lecter to wonderful effect, and Bates Motel latched onto the adolescent years of Psycho’s Norman Bates for its own charming, if uneven, mash-up of Oedipal issues and Twin Peaks small-town weirdisms. But the remake deals kept closing, and now Hollywood is awash in projects repurposing old movie properties for the small screen.  This Friday, Syfy debuts its latest foray into the arena with 12 Monkeys, a new series based on Terry Gilliam’s 1995 cult classic. The building blocks are familiar: 30 years in the future a mysterious virus has wiped out humanity, and a group of scientists send a man named James Cole back to our present to investigate the disease’s origins. Aaron Stanford (The CW’s Nikita) swaps in for Bruce Willis, while Amanda Schull is Cassandra, a doctor that teams up with him to try to save humanity. The original 12 Monkeys, like the French short La Jetée that inspired it, was a puzzle box movie about insanity and inevitability, carefully crafted to wrap around itself and land an unexpected emotional punch at the end. How a series would tackle that element was one of the things I was most interested in, but the answer appears to be that Syfy is sidestepping it completely and doing something different with the premise. And as strange as it sounds, that’s one of the most interesting things about the series. The new 12 Monkeys is a straightforward sci-fi adventure, with Cole time-tripping from year to year — the show calls it “splintering,” presumably because that’s supposed to sound cool — thanks to a chemical process that also conveniently gives him accelerated healing powers and enhanced fighting ability. In that sense it’s nothing at all like Gilliam’s film, and the straightforward treatment carries on throughout. The wide-lens dystopia of the original is gone, replaced by a polished but much less distinguished aesthetic — call it basic cable futurism — and the jagged edginess of Willis’ Cole is pounded flat. Instead, Stanford creates a generic action hero with no real sense of personality or past (at least, nothing we see in the first two episodes). It gets 12 Monkeys into trouble; without strong lead performances to ground the universe, the show’s strained reaches left me laughing for all the wrong reasons. (Genius doctor after going over Cole’s vitals: “This guy is a flesh and blood molecular computer!”)  But it can take time for a series to find its footing, and co-creators Travis Fickett and Terry Matalas are clearly interested in using the broader canvas to play with the conventions of time travel and to grow the film’s nugget of a premise into an expanded universe’s worth of mythology. When Cole starts ricocheting off people that have already met his future self, Doctor Who-style, 12 Monkeys is at its best. That’s particularly clear once the show gets all the introductory necessities of the pilot out of the way and shifts its focus to the daughter of a rich biotech executive (Emily Hampshire, in the role originally played by Brad Pitt) and a mysterious villain that is part Stephen King creation and part Slenderman. 12 Monkeys’ allure is not in the familiar premise, but in the promise of things beyond the edges of Gilliam’s vision — and a reminder that while film reboots may have limited tools to work with, serialized television is another matter entirely.  When tackling a known character or story in two hours, there’s an inherent tension between satisfying expectations while also differentiating from the source material. It’s why rebooted origin stories are so exhausting; how many different ways can we really see Peter Parker become Spider-Man? TV, on the other hand, is all about long-term world building. Characters, relationships, narrative set-ups and pay-offs evolve and play out over years. Quite simply, television does things movies can’t, and with the right creative forces at the helm, a show can use an existing premise to tell an entirely new set of stories — just ask Fargo’s Noah Hawley. Not to compare the two shows directly, of course. Monkeys isn’t even attempting the kind of storytelling that Hawley was able to pull off, but it already has enough secrets and mysteries set into motion that I’ve set my DVR to find out what happens next. And while my stance on movie reboots may not have softened, I’m somehow optimistic about the potential of these television projects. You only need to travel back 11 years to find evidence that Syfy — then just SciFi — knew how to rework a property with Ronald D. Moore’s Battlestar Galactica (another show, it should be noted, that struggled with some clumsy performances and B-movie flavor before hitting stride).   In any case, we might as well all make our peace with the movie-to-TV reboot concept now. With Minority Report, Real Genius, and Evil Dead just some of the titles currently in the works, it’s not like we’re going to have much of a choice.",0.5585546897592395,0.4414453102407605,0.17021729904293245,962,4.9397089397089395,566,6.1395759717314489,0,8,"Culture, Entertainment, TV Review",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Google’s introducing several new features that change how we use our watches, from Wi-Fi support to hand gestures and hand-drawn emoji. Individually, these changes are small, but collectively, they promise to make even year-old hardware seem new. They also ensure that Android Wear keeps up (and in some cases surpasses) the Apple Watch from a pure features perspective. That could become important down the line should Google’s plans to release Android Wear for the iPhone come to fruition. Probably the most fun part of the update is the new support for drawing emoji characters. Instead of replying with a canned response or awkwardly speaking into your wrist, you can draw an emoji character and Android Wear will do its best to recognize it and convert it to an actual emoji. In practice, it ends up being entertaining, both when it gets it right, and when it fails horribly.   The feature was born out of a company hackathon, and is also included in the Android Handwriting Input app Google introduced last week. The Android Wear team decided to turn the one-off idea into a feature, but needed help in making it work for potentially millions of people. It ended up turning to other Googlers who were used as guinea pigs to figure out a kind of common handwriting language for things like thumbs up signs, hamburgers, and yes — even poop. ""We had volunteer Googlers send us hundreds of thousands of drawing samples,"" says Jeff Chang, the lead product manager for Wear. ""We’d say ‘hey, draw a dog, draw it on the screen.’"" They’d do that over and over, and eventually the result, Chang says, is a reliable way to covertly reply to things in situations where you can’t talk, or when an emoji is a more appropriate response. And by all appearances, it’s much faster than using the emoji selector Apple’s come up with for its watch. There’s even a simple menu you can pull up with recently used emoji and a list of the top 25 most popular emoji so that you don’t have to draw anything at all. While emoji are useful for responding to people, you need to be near your phone to even get those messages, something Google is changing. As The Verge previously reported, Android Wear now supports Wi-Fi. The change means that you can be well beyond your phone’s Bluetooth range and still get notifications, take phone calls, and do searches, just as if your phone was in your pocket. Wi-Fi is already built into many Android Wear devices, however it's been dormant and waiting to be flipped on. This means you can go to another part of your house (if you have a really big house), and still be connected to a phone that’s not on your person. But the more interesting part is that you will stay connected to your phone no matter what Wi-Fi network your watch is connected to, via Google’s cloud services. Google will also automatically sniff out open Wi-Fi hotspots and connect your watch. Even with this newfound freedom, Android Wear devices are still not designed to exist on their own, says Chang. ""The brains of the operation are still on the phone,"" he says. ""Wi-Fi support is more about when you’re away from your phone it continues to work."" The same goes for when you’ll unbox a new watch with the update; it will still need to be paired to an Android phone. Two other changes Google’s made in the update impact what you see on screen, and how you interact with it. One is a new low-power mode for the screen when you’re not actively looking at it. It allows apps to ambiently display just a minimal amount of data, usually in black and white, without a gesture to turn the screen on. Google already does this for your watch face, but is opening up the feature for apps too. This is especially useful for things like shopping lists, fitness apps, and music controls, Chang says. Developers will now be able to tweak how often the information you see gets updated in the low-power mode, but it could ultimately mean less fiddling. The other change to the screen is how you interact with it. The update adds a new gesture system that lets you navigate around your watch without touching the screen. You can now jump to the next card in your stream with a flick outwards. Do the same gesture inwards, and it goes back a card. That could arguably make bezel-laden Android Wear devices like the LG G Watch R or the upcoming Urbane more enjoyable to use, but also frustrating if you’re trying to traverse notifications on a bumpy bus or subway car. Chang says the team did lots of testing for just that situation, and says that it’s difficult to do it by mistake. And if that actually happens too much, you can simply turn the feature off. ""We’ve certainly done a lot to reduce false positives, but the nice thing is, it’s not a destructive action. It’s just a way to scroll up and down,"" he says. In other words, flicking your wrist will not accidentally start a phone call to your boss. At least not in this version. The first watch to get the update will be the upcoming LG Urbane, which comes with it out of the box. Other Android Wear devices will get it as a part of an update that’s rolling out beginning next month, though Chang stresses that it will be up to each individual device maker to add Wi-Fi to future products, or retroactively update old ones with Wi-Fi support. Leading up to the Apple Watch being announced last fall, the big question on everyone’s mind was how Apple’s rendition of a watch might be better or worse than existing smartwatches, including Android Wear. Many people were also looking at how Google might respond in areas where it obviously fell short. These new things like keeping apps — actual native apps — running at all times, using emoji in a very simple and non-jarring way, and making devices less reliant on phones are all things that either help set Android Wear apart — or at least ensure feature parity. But Google will need to prove it can quickly distribute the update to existing watches, and further prove that Wi-Fi connectivity won’t make battery life significantly worse. And if Google also manages to get Android Wear support going on the iPhone, the smartwatch wars might shape up to be just as wild as the smartphone wars.

A number of sample images shot with the G4 show off its potential, and they look predictably lustrous and splendid. The big emphasis throughout is on the appeal to professional users; they're not the typical smartphone photography demographic, but whatever's good for them will surely be beneficial to more casual users as well.

Phones and tablets have become so much more than ""second screens"" — for many of us, they're our main screens now. But if you'd like something that offers a bit more flexibility whether you're at home or on the road, there's a new option from ZTE: a smart projector called the Spro 2. It's the next version of the company's first mini projector (the Spro), and it will be initially available exclusively through AT&T. We saw it for the first time at CES this year, but a final version of the unit made it to our office on Friday, so I took it for a spin.  It's a small and light mobile projector, measuring 5.3 inches by 5.2 inches by 1.2 inches thick, and it weighs just a little over a pound. That's not small enough to fit in a pocket, but it will easily fit into your bag. It's Wi-Fi enabled and has an LTE radio (the Spro 2 works exclusively with AT&T for now) that can be used as a hotspot, and on the back of the device there is a micro SD card slot as well as ports for audio, USB, and HDMI.  That means that, despite the small package, the Spro 2 can handle just about everything you throw at it. I watched video files from my Google Drive account, used Netflix and Hulu, and even plugged in a PlayStation 4. The performance was fluid and never stuttered, the fan noise was negligible, and it never got too hot. The Spro 2 runs a custom version of Android 4.4 KitKat, so you can access any media that you would be able to watch on your phone, and you control it all through a rather nice 5-inch 720p touchscreen display. Its 6300 mAh battery will last over two hours while streaming content, too, and up to 16 hours on standby. And there's an on-board speaker on the bottom of the device, but you won't want to use it — the best solution would probably be to connect the Spro 2 to some Bluetooth-enabled speakers. The biggest limitation of the Spro 2 is, unsurprisingly, brightness. It's woefully dimmer than a television screen, and at least 10 times dimmer than most standard home cinema projectors. It reaches 200 lumens when it's plugged in, but you can only set it to medium brightness or lower when it's not. While that's brighter than most competing mini projectors, you're still going to struggle to see the image if there are any other competing light sources in the room.     In a truly dark room, however, the picture looks great — provided you have a smooth white wall or a screen. It projects a 720p image up to a size of 120 inches that stays clear throughout, although the colors wash out a bit. There's an autofocus feature that works well and an ""auto keystone"" feature, which keeps the image rectangular no matter how high or low you point the projector. (There's no side-to-side adjustment, however.) The Spro 2 is definitely capable, but it's not cheap. You'll be able to buy it starting April 24th for $399 with a two-year contract on AT&T, or $499 without one. That's more expensive than competing portable projectors, but you get many more features in a much sleeker design. The price almost bumps up against that of the the cheapest home cinema projectors, which offer much better image quality but take up more space, are louder, and aren't portable. So the question here is who, exactly, is this thing for? If it offered a better picture in any room, it would be a compelling purchase for anyone. As it is, it's probably only for heavy travelers who need a presentation device, reliable connectivity wherever they go, and also don't want to use the decade-old television at the foot of the bed in their hotel room. There might even be a place for it in the home — after all, this thing is capable enough to replace your Apple TV, Roku, or other streaming device, and you can more easily bring it from one room to another. But even if it's the right device for those people, the rest of us will get by just fine with the screens we have.

All of them run Android TV, which replaces Sony's previous, clunky software for a richer experience deeply tied to Google's own software and third-party streaming apps. Most of Sony's lineup is on the larger side when it comes to display size. Though you'll find a few options available in the 43- to 55-inch range, Sony is putting the most effort into models that will dominate most home theater setups at 65 or 75 inches. It's here you'll find the flagship XBR-75X940C, a $7,999 TV that features full-array local dimming, 4K resolution, and support for HDR video output, which Sony will deliver through a firmware update sometime this summer. Obviously Sony isn't trying to wage a pricing war with Vizio and other manufacturers making entry-level 4K TVs. At a recent press preview, the company expressed confidence that the picture quality these sets display stands alone among the competition. For its flagship models in particular, Sony tosses around its branded ""features"" like X-Tended Dynamic Range Pro and Triluminos when explaining what your $8,000 will get you versus a TV from Samsung or LG. Sony's latest and greatest are capable of displaying a wider color gamut, which Sony says can match and exceed what Samsung's doing with its SUHD TVs. (No, none of Sony's TVs feature a curved design, but with the best ones, you're still stuck with those pretty large speakers on the sides.) HDR looks fantastic, but you'll have a tough time finding content at launch The HDR demonstrations Sony gave were impressive; executives think they've found the right recipe to create stunning picture quality, eye-popping brights, inky blacks, and contrast that can rival OLED. Sony isn't certifying these TVs for Dolby Vision, and the specifications it uses for HDR differ slightly from Dolby's approach, but it looks pretty fantastic. Content is a huge question mark this early. We're only now getting to an okay selection of 4K movies and TV shows, and manufacturers already want to shift focus to HDR. But this one's not a gimmick; HDR looks great, and Sony also says its premier sets will try to ""upscale"" regular Blu-rays and HD video to benefit from the feature. But again, to do that, you'll be paying a total sum that could decorate your entire house with Vizio 4K sets. (A slightly cheaper, 65-inch entry into HDR will cost $4,499.99, offering fewer bells and whistles than the flagship X940C model.) Sadly, Sony isn't yet saying when its ridiculously thin XBR-55X900C will hit the market, nor how much it'll cost. A good section of this thing measures just 0.2 inches thick, which is thinner than many smartphones people are carrying around in their pocket. With dimensions like that, Sony had to build its own mount system for the X900C, and also claims that the bezel basically disappears when it's turned on, leaving only the picture visible. The X900C is probably thinner than the smartphone in your pocket Based on the brief demo we saw, Android TV on Sony's sets looks basically identical to what you'd see from Google's Nexus Player. There's an added section for switching inputs, but other than that it's the same. You get the benefits of built-in Google Cast support and a healthy ecosystem of third-party apps. (Amazon Instant Video appears on Sony's TVs and in a press release, which is a bit odd since Amazon hasn't yet officially unveiled an Android TV app.) And everything's fast, responsive, and fluid. Sony definitely made the right move here in collaborating with Google to have Android handle the software side of things.   Along with the new TVs, Sony is also updating its lineup of soundbars. The new flagship HT-ST9 runs $1,499, which obviously is on the very high end of sound bar pricing. But Sony says it offers unrivaled audio performance, with sound that, like its predecessor, was fine tuned by Academy Award-winning Sony Pictures engineers. It includes three HDMI ports, 800 watts of output, support for Bluetooth audio, and 7.1 channel surround sound with its seven discrete amplifiers and nine speakers. There's a wireless subwoofer packaged with it, too. Cheaper options in Sony's new line exist between $349 and $699, but the ST9 is the one it's pushing on consumers who want the best possible audio — yet somehow don't have room for or want to fuss around with a proper surround system. The soundbars are also due to start shipping in May.",0.6514603460204029,0.3485396539795971,0.16446345973649923,772,4.9132124352331603,450,5.8511111111111109,1,2,"Home, Tech",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Several people have since died as a result of the virus, and dozens more have been infected, as scientists around the globe struggle to understand how it spreads and pinpoint the source.  In April, China took the drastic measure of shutting down 780 live poultry markets in order to stop the spread of H7N9 bird flu, a sometimes-lethal virus that had been quickly spreading. Reports of infection by the virus all but stopped following the shutdown, and researchers are now reporting that it was in fact the shutdown that caused the change. In a paper published tomorrow in The Lancet, researchers led from The University of Hong Kong report that shutting down live poultry markets... A deadly new strain of bird flu called H7N9 has killed at least 43 people and infected a total of 134, mainly in western China, according to the World Health Organization. The outbreak in humans has slowed down since the virus was first detected in March, thankfully. But things on the virology front are heating back up because today, 22 scientists from around the world announced their decision to begin new experiments on the virus, which will involve deliberately mutating it in laboratories... Scientists have confirmed that the deadly H7N9 bird flu strain is transferrable between ferrets. Six of the animals — which often serve as a good measure for the risk of transmission between humans — were injected with the virus and placed in a cage with three uninfected ferrets. Three more uninfected specimens were nearby, but outside of the cage. All three caged ferrets became infected with H7N9, though only outside ferret was afflicted. That suggests there's less risk of infection by air... After months of mounting concern, Chinese health officials are breathing a sigh of relief: no new human cases of H7N9 have been reported in the country in more than a week. The milestone marks the first time since March, when the H7N9 outbreak first began, that human cases haven't continued to increase.  In the week beginning May 13, one previously infected patient succumbed to the virus, according to a statement issued on Monday by China's National Health and Family Planning Commission.... As influenzas go, the H7N9 virus at first seemed relatively benign: in late March, the Chinese government reported that three individuals had contracted the illness, and that two had died. The disturbing revelation was tempered, however, by reassurances that human-to-human transmission was highly unlikely, and that Chinese health authorities were taking unprecedented measures to monitor and contain the virus. But four weeks later, the situation has changed: 23 people are now dead, and 122... Scientists in China say they have pinpointed a likely source of a new strain of avian influenza (bird flu) that's killed 23 people in the country so far: chicken sold in the markets of Zhejiang, China. In a study fast-tracked into online publication in the international medical journal the Lancet yesterday, 30 scientists from hospitals and universities around China took samples of the H7N9 virus strain from human patients and compared it to samples of viruses grown from chicken in a  Zhejiang... A new strain of avian influenza (bird flu) that has killed 22 people so far in China is ""one of the most lethal influenza viruses"" that scientists have ever encountered, according to Keiji Fukuda, an official with the World Health Organization (WHO). Fukuda also said of the new H7N9 virus strain that ""when we look at influenza viruses, this is an unusually dangerous virus for humans,"" as Reuters reported today.  A recent outbreak of a new strain of avian influenza (bird flu) has killed at least 17 people in China since the first cases in humans were reported in late March. No cases of the H7N9 virus have yet been reported outside of that country, but in the US, precautions are being taken anyway. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued new guidance to doctors and other health care workers yesterday, warning them to ""consider the possibility of avian influenza A(H7N9) virus... Researchers in Japan and the US have analyzed the genes of a new strain of avian (bird) flu that's killed at least 17 people in China in recent weeks, and discovered that some of the new H7N9 viruses have mutated to be more effective and deadlier in humans than they are in birds. The findings ""raise concerns regarding their [the virsues'] pandemic potential,"" according to the researchers, who published their findings in a paper in the journal Eurosurveillance last week.  In a worrying development, the World Health Organization is reporting that a new strain of bird flu has infected people who have reportedly never come in contact with poultry.

Now, researchers are welcoming yet another bio-inspired robot to join the menagerie: a 'bot built to emulate the movements of baby sea turtles. In a new study published in Bioinspiration and Biomimetics, a team of physicists and engineers out of Georgia Tech and Northwestern University shared progress on ""FlipperBot,"" a robot designed to emulate the strategies employed by young sea turtles in order to traverse both firm terrain and sand with equal ease.    The robot's creation started in nature itself, with a lengthy study on 25 hatchling sea turtles in their natural habitat. Researchers compiled data on the movement patterns of the turtles, namely how they were able to maintain their pace while zipping along sandy ground. That pace is important for the critters: immediately after hatching, the turtles need to make their way across sand and into water — away from eager predators on land. As it turns out, the turtle's success came down to flexible wrists at the ends of each flipper. ""On hard ground, they seemed to lock their wrists to move forward,"" study co-author Daniel Goldman, an associate professor at Georgia Tech, told The Verge. On sand, the turtles used a different tactic: they dug their limbs into the sand at a specific depth — ""but not so much that the sand would flow around the limbs and slow them down,"" Goldman said — and then bent their wrists to propel themselves. A wee robot... capable of traipsing through tricky terrain Following that research, the team translated this flexible wrist principle to a robotic model, dubbed FlipperBot. With a little tweaking, they managed to develop a wee robot — weighing in at less than a pound — capable of traipsing through tricky terrain using the same patterns as its biological peer. Obviously, the work — which was funded, in part, by the US Army Research Laboratory — could offer new tricks for the development of robots that use flippers to either traverse land or water, or be versatile enough to do both. But that's actually not the top priority. Instead, Goldman and his colleagues hope that robotic models like this one yield a better understanding of animal locomotion. ""We're able to study precise movements in robot models that is much harder to do in the field,"" he noted. The work might also play a role in understanding evolution. ""I hope we can use models like this to understand [more] about the flipper-like appendages from the earliest animals to walk on land,"" Goldman said.",0.55689143460528,0.44310856539472,0.8381616567189694,441,4.9523809523809526,274,5.8613138686131387,0,0,Science,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Starting May 1st, some of the exhibits at America’s premier art galleries will be closed, essentially at random, because of sweeping, mandatory federal government budget cuts known as the sequester. Worse still, even the staff at the Smithsonian’s six major art museums won’t know on any given day which exhibits will be closed, and the Smithsonian won’t be posting that information online or making it publicly available in advance.  ""you may show up and find that a particular exhibition is closed."" ""The museums are going to be open seven days a week as always,"" said Linda St. Thomas, chief spokesperson for the Smithsonian Institution, in a phone interview with The Verge. ""But you may show up and find that a particular exhibition is closed, because we didn’t have enough security for that area."" The six art museums due to face random exhibition closures are the National Portrait Gallery, the American Art Museum, the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, the National Museum of African Art, and the Freer and Sackler Galleries of Asian Art. Together, they constitute a sizeable portion of the Smithsonian's 19 total museums, most of which are largely funded by the government and through donations (Cooper Hewitt in New York charges adult admission fees, but is currently closed for renovation). Over three million visitors combined passed through these six museums alone in 2012. The Verge reached out to each of the six affected museums, but was referred back to St. Thomas for comment. Ai Weiwei contemporary art installation at the Smithsonian's Hirshhorn Museum, courtesy the Smithsonian Institution.   To be clear, the Smithsonian isn’t laying off any staff, nor are any workers being furloughed — the controversial practice of forcing employees to take unpaid time off to balance the budget. That strategy is, however, currently underway among the Federal Aviation Administration’s air traffic controllers and the Internal Revenue Service's (IRS) employees — all thanks to the $84.5 billion in federal spending cuts initiated on March 1st. The cuts, initially meant as a failsafe until lawmakers agreed on a longer-term compromise that never manifested, will now be enacted until at least the end of September. So the Smithsonian — which is supposed to chop nearly 5 percent of its budget, or $42 million, this year alone — is cutting back on contracted security guards from the private firm AlliedBarton, which staffs the security detail at the Smithsonian’s six art museums in DC. Asked about how many security staff would be affected, AlliedBarton provided the following statement: ""AlliedBarton Security Services does not release information related to client contracts. We work in conjunction with our clients to meet their ongoing needs for security officer services."" The Smithsonian has also implemented a freeze on new staff hires, cut down on employee travel, and postponed maintenance at other major museums, including at the popular National Air and Space Museum. Photo of the Smithsonian American Art Museum and National Portrait Gallery, courtesy the Donald W. Reynolds Center and Smithsonian Institution. ""these required reductions will be felt by our visitors."" ""We have little budgetary flexibility remaining, and these required reductions will be felt by our visitors and those who are increasingly expecting services online,"" said G. Wayne Clough, the Smithsonian Institution’s Secretary, when he testified before Congress on the impact of the sequestration last week. Both Clough and St. Thomas repeatedly warned that if budget cuts become permanent through 2014 and subsequent years, they could ""translate into permanent staff reductions,"" and result in museums ""being forced to postpone or cancel exhibitions,"" as Clough put it in his testimony. As for why the Institution won’t be posting information about which exhibits within the museums will be closed on which days, St. Thomas said it was because the decisions would be made on a day-to-day, case-by-case basis by museum directors and the heads of security at each museum. ""The reason we can’t post [closing information] online is because we don’t know,"" St. Thomas told The Verge.  ""We won't know enough time in advance to do a web post."" ""We won’t know enough time in advance to do a web post."" At the same time, the Smithsonian — which calls itself the largest museum and research complex in the world — is aiming to keep the rest of its operations as normal as possible, and its 13 other museums won’t be subject to random closures. St. Thomas sought to emphasize that ""every museum is still open,"" but the decision to close some art exhibitions at random is largely unprecedented in the Smithsonian’s history. In 1986, a series of funding cuts forced the Smithsonian to reduce its museums’ evening hours during the summer. Photo of the Smithsonian Freer Gallery courtyard at night, courtesy the Smithsonian Institution. But that was almost 30 years ago, and the Smithsonian hasn’t felt a budget crunch like this since then. ""In recent times, we haven’t faced anything this severe,"" St. Thomas said. Still, it’s unlikely the Smithsonian will alleviate the crunch by collecting admission at DC museums.

At least according to the founders of Mars One, a Dutch non-profit aiming to send four people to the red planet in 2023 — and leave them there. The goal? For those intrepid settlers to develop an autonomous, self-sustaining society. Speaking to a handful of reporters at New York's Hotel Pennsylvania on Monday, the intergalactic pioneers behind Mars One offered up new details on their plan. And wannabe space cowboys, take note: Mars One founder Bas Lansdorp used the event as an opportunity to open the selection process for would-be astronauts. They have until August 31st to submit an application. ""We call on everyone interested to apply,"" he said. ""You can go to Mars.""  But even if you get there, you won't be coming back. Assuming the Mars One program proceeds as planned, four astronauts will land on the red planet in 2023, and be joined by four more (two men and two women) in two-year intervals thereafter. After a seven month journey, those first settlers will complete the construction of living quarters, cultivate gardens for nourishment, and perform scientific experiments. Eventually they'll procreate, and at some point, of course, they'll die. ""This is a mission of the world."" All under the watchful eyes of the entire world. The complete Mars One venture, from astronaut selection to eventual Mars colonization, will be broadcast on TV and online, according to the organization. ""This is a mission of the world, and we want to treat it like that,"" Lansdorp told The Verge. ""So much of our goal is to inspire people at home."" Not to mention that traveling to Mars is, you know, going to be expensive. ""On a more practical note, opening this up to a big audience means we can partner with advertisers and sponsors,"" he continued. ""[And] we think this will be the biggest audience ever.""  Alexander is a 26-year-old student in biomedical engineering from Russia, whose interests include ""neural science"" and ""pole dance."" Ilona, a 23-year-old in Finland, is a self-described ""bookish diplomat"" who hopes to live ""a long, hearty life."" Stephen, a married father of three from Germany, is a flight instructor who's been ""breathing space"" for all of his 44 years. These are three of the first applicants for the Mars One mission, but there might soon be many more: Lansdorp said he anticipates ""up to a million"" interested parties, all of whom will be asked to fill out a questionnaire, write an essay, and produce a short video explaining why they're the right candidate. After that first round, successful applicants will meet with ""a committee"" of Mars One consultants for further questioning. That's when things get really interesting: applicants who make it to round three will undergo additional interviews, all of them broadcast online and on TV. The general public will be asked to narrow the competition by voting for their favorite candidate. A fourth and final round will see the selection of 24-40 applicants, split into groups of four, who'll undergo several years of training to prep for possible space travel. At some point, experts with Mars One will select four of those candidates for take-off. ""You don't have to be a fighter jet pilot to do this,"" Lansdorp said. ""These four people, these adventurers, they will be heroes around the world."" ""It is important for [them]...to survive on Mars."" But before that day comes, they'll have a lot of work to do. That includes seven years of training, including annual three-month stints in a confined setting that'll mimic the limitations — in both living space and creature comforts — of what they can expect on Mars. ""We will train [them] in dentistry, medicine, biology, archeology,"" Dr. Norbert Kraft, the chief medical officer for Mars One, said. ""[They] have to keep up with the training and show progress in it. It is important for [them], in the end, to survive on Mars."" Successful candidates don't need exceptional physical fitness or a profound knowledge of space exploration, Kraft noted. Anyone over the age of 18, in relatively good health, can apply. The deciding factor? Whether you play well with others. ""The key is that you can work with other people, you are empathetic, adaptive,"" he told The Verge. ""If you're someone who explodes when there's a sock on the floor, this maybe isn't for you.""  Audacious as Mars One sounds, it's initial inspiration was relatively mundane. A childhood space aficionado, Landsorp initially made his fortune as the founder of wind energy company Ampyx Power. He sold his majority share in the company in 2011, in part inspired by Packing For Mars, the bestseller by science journalist Mary Roach, which reignited his dreams of space travel. ""It started as a very egocentric thing,"" he said. ""At first, I was intent that I would go to Mars myself."" Lansdorp reached out to experts interviewed by Roach in her book, including Dr. Kraft, formerly a NASA research scientist. Together, they devised a much bolder plan, and publicly announced the Mars One venture last year. Given the relative infancy of their venture, the Mars One team admit they've yet to finesse the technology necessary to get travelers to Mars and sustain them once arrived. Not that Lansdorp is particularly concerned. ""People conceive of this as being such a complex thing,"" he said. ""It isn't, really. The technology to do this already exists, and we are simply going to take advantage of that."" Indeed, the organization doesn't itself plan to develop any new technology. Instead, they said they'll harness existing systems and contract out new requirements — already, they've partnered with Paragon Space Development Corporation for the development of robust ""life-support systems"" that'll include air supplies and running water. They've also had extensive discussions with SpaceX, Lansdorp said, about using a modified version of the Dragon capsule to actually land participants on the red planet. ""I'm not saying this mission isn't really, really, really hard. But it definitely isn't impossible."" But Mars One may already have circumvented the biggest challenge associated with human missions to the red planet: bringing astronauts home. ""It's not rocket science to know that if you don't have to bring things back, you can significantly reduce the mass you're starting with,"" Dr. Robert Braun, a professor of space technology at Georgia Tech who has worked on several NASA-led Mars missions, told The Verge. ""I'm not saying this mission isn't really, really, really hard. But it definitely isn't impossible."" Aside from actually getting several vessels on Mars — the team also plans to land robotic rovers on the planet, to set up an initial habitat and life support systems — Braun noted that astronauts will be exposed to dangerous levels of radiation. ""How do you keep people safe outside of earth's atmosphere?"" he said. ""You'd need shielding to protect your body, and no existing concept is particularly feasible."" When asked by The Verge, Mars One leaders admitted that they haven't addressed this challenge just yet. ""But we are working on it,"" Norbert said. ""That is a very high priority for us.""  Technical challenges aside, the Mars One group will also confront a notable financial barrier: they estimate that the initial mission to Mars will cost around $6 billion, with subsequent trips costing even more. The group won't reveal how much money they've raised thus far, though an online donation ticker suggests they've only rustled up around $72,000 from generous fans. How to raise the other $5.9 billion or so? Corporate backers, application fees ... and a decades-long reality television show. ""It sounds like a lot of money, and it is a lot of money, but everyone on the globe will want to see this,"" Lansdorp said, estimating that ""four billion people will be watching."" The Olympic Games seem to be Lansdorp's primary metric in calculating potential profits: he noted that the IOM earned $4 billion just from selling broadcasting rights to the 2012 London Olympics. ""If you think of it that way, $6 billion starts to sound much smaller."" Martian gardening and baby-making Of course, it remains to be seen whether television networks and advertisers agree. Not to mention how long a fickle audience, once the initial flurry of activity wanes, will be captivated by Martian gardening and baby-making. But none of these challenges — whether technological or financial — seem enough to sway Lansdorp and his team from their long-term vision: a community of Martian citizens with their own holidays, their own economy, and their own laws. ""The day I am most excited for is when the colony declares its independence,"" he said. ""And we can then say that we are an interplanetary species.""",0.6288452914552839,0.3711547085447161,0.8503018735167496,1470,5.0387755102040819,761,6.3679369250985545,0,0,"Science, Report",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

But this latest test flight, Grasshopper's fifth, continues SpaceX's goal of launching the rocket to ever-increasing heights — this time up to 820 feet. Even more impressively, the rocket managed to hover in place at that height, holding ""against wind,"" before returning squarely to the launch pad, as SpaceX founder Elon Musk tweeted.       The Grasshopper isn't spaceworthy quite yet and it's not clear just when it will be. But SpaceX's goal in designing the craft — which is based on parts from its active Falcon 9 rocket lineup and Merlin 1D engines, with added metal landing legs — is to make the first ever viable, commercial, rapidly reusable rocket. SpaceX thinks that the technology will drastically reduce the costs associated with spaceflight and pave the way for more routine launches into orbit, including by civilians, as Musk has repeatedly stated in the past. Update: A spokesperson with SpaceX tells us that the company hopes to rapidly implement the reusability technology being tested here for its space launches by retrieving and reusing a Falcon 9 first-stage rocket component from a water landing in the ocean later this year. SpaceX could also attempt a first-stage landing on dry ground using the landing legs in 2014.

However, a researcher at Sandia National Laboratories has developed an alternative to ammonium nitrate that still helps plants grow — but can't be used so easily as an explosive compound. Engineer Kevin Fleming responded to an open call from the  Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Organization (JIEDDO, part of the US Department of Defense) for ideas on neutralizing ammonium nitrate — which is commonly used in improvised explosive devices (IEDs). Fewer IEDs would be good news Fleming, who previously had experience in both organic gardening and with IEDs as part of the US military, discovered that adding iron sulfate helps stabilize the inherent properties of ammonium sulfate that make it easy to destabilize and very sensitive to shock when mixed with combustible materials like diesel. As such, IEDs using ammonium nitrate are heavily prevalent in Afghanistan — it was used in about 65 percent of the 16,300 homemade bombs found in the country last year. The compound is actually illegal in Afghanistan, but is widely available in neighboring Pakistan, where a quarter of the country's gross domestic product is dependent on agriculture. With his new discovery, Fleming is hoping to cut back on ammonium nitrate's availability for those building IEDs and eventually save lives, though a move to his compound will take a lot of time and effort. ""It's easy to get in large quantities,"" Fleming said. ""The sheer volume of ammonium nitrate is gigantic.""  To help get his discovery out into the world, Fleming has decided not to patent or license the formula — instead, it will be freely available to anyone who wants to use it.",0.41851246301901024,0.5814875369809898,0.8694607657114347,298,5.0570469798657722,194,5.9329896907216497,0,0,Science,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Sort of. In a new request for research proposals, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is asking investigators to develop refined techniques for the measurement of oxytocin — a neurohormone implicated in myriad human behaviors, but best known for its roles in bonding and sexual arousal. In recent years, research into oxytocin has surged. We've long known that oxytocin is important for reproduction, and that it plays a pivotal role in maternal bonding after childbirth. More recent studies suggest that oxytocin might hasten wound healing, bolster against stress, and enhance levels of connectedness and generosity. As DARPA points out, those attributes ""affect behaviors relevant to national security"" — including vulnerability to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as well as social interactions that might impact military cohesiveness or even the outcome of an international conflict.  ""Novel methods to measure oxytocin levels in the human body"" So in an effort to better understand oxytocin, the agency's looking for better ways to measure it in the human body. Unfortunately, that's trickier than it sounds: because oxytocin is present in extremely small quantities, picking it up from blood samples with any degree of sensitivity is tough. And the process is nearly impossible with sweat or saliva samples, both of which would be more convenient to test, the agency pointed out. In particular, DARPA's looking for an approach that could distinguish bioactive forms of oxytocin — those that play a role in behavior — from inert ones. ""More sensitive and specific assay techniques for oxytocin would provide a more accurate picture of the complex regulation of this intriguing neurohormone,"" the agency noted. An effort to enhance public messages from the US military By the end of the program, DARPA wants to see a method successfully tested in ""animal or human experiments,"" and data on oxytocin levels during stress and social interaction. They hope to see the technique applied in several areas, including the evaluation of how oxytocin might help prevent or treat PTSD. Perhaps most intriguingly, the agency noted that their Narrative Networks program — an effort to enhance public messages from the US military through an understanding of the brain's inner workings — is already evaluating the role of oxytocin, and might also benefit from this new research.",0.8799811418102286,0.12001885818977143,0.24968207464584627,389,5.4113110539845755,233,6.4935622317596566,0,0,Science,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

A team of researchers concluded that Troodon, a small, meat-eating North American dinosaur, probably buried its eggs partially in mud and hatched them by sitting. The conclusion was reached by analyzing fossilized eggshells found in Montana and Alberta. ""Based on our calculations, the eggshells of Troodon were very similar to those of brooding birds, which tells us that this dinosaur did not completely bury its eggs in nesting materials like crocodiles do,"" said study co-author Darla Zelenitsky of the University of Calgary. ""Both the eggs and the surrounding sediments indicate only partial burial,"" added lead author David Varricchio at Montana State University, ""thus an adult would have directly contacted the exposed parts of the eggs during incubation.""  Study suggests ""Bird-like nesting behaviors evolved in meat-eating dinosaurs prior to the origin of birds"" The researchers compared the porosity of Troodon's eggs to those of birds and crocodiles; the dinosaur eggs exhibited varying amounts of pores across different areas of the shell, suggesting that they were laid vertically in the mud to facilitate incubation in combination with bodily contact. This is similar to the nesting habits of the Egyptian plover (pictured above), which cools its eggs by sitting on them with a wet belly. Crocodiles, on the other hand, completely bury their eggs in enclosed nests, and the shells are much more porous to compensate. The researchers concluded that the troodontids were the non-avian dinosaurs most similar to birds in reproductive behavior and physiology; the study ""helps substantiate that some bird-like nesting behaviors evolved in meat-eating dinosaurs prior to the origin of birds,"" said Zelenitsky.

""an unusually dangerous virus for humans."" The comments come on the same day as the first reported case of H7N9 in a person outside China, where all 108 confirmed cases have occurred since the outbreak first began in late March. Late Wednesday afternoon Taiwan time, the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control reported its first confirmed human diagnosis of H7N9, in a man who had recently returned from China and developed symptoms three days later. That man is currently in severe condition and being treated in a contained room, according to Taiwan's CDC. Symptoms of H7N9 include severe cough and fever, which can progress to severe pneumonia and eventually death. So far, the virus appears to have been concentrated in elderly men, but scientists still aren't sure why. Unfortunately, the initial days of an international scientific investigation into bird flu in China, led by the World Health Organization, haven't answered many key questions yet — such as whether or not the virus has the potential to be transmitted between humans. Typically, bird flu is transmitted only from birds to humans who have been in direct contact with them, limiting the pandemic potential of the virus.  But a large portion of the new H7N9 cases in humans have reportedly occurred in people who haven't been around birds. Part of the WHO's scientific investigation has been hampered by the fact that birds infected with the virus seem to suffer less severe forms of illness  than human patients, and don't display visible symptoms.

His 32-person jail has sold out of the 200 e-cigs it ordered in December, and it now has more on the way.  E-cig manufacturers have started making 'jail-safe' plastic models Traditional cigarettes are reportedly banned from most prisons due to fire and second-hand smoke concerns. Not all e-cigarettes are allowed into prisons either because of their metal bodies, but the Times reports that some manufacturers have begun making ""jail-safe"" plastic models to get approval. Prisons spoken to by the Times seem to be finding that e-cigs have reduced violence between inmates, likely because it provides them with a nicotine fix they would otherwise be unable to get. But for prisons, selling e-cigarettes is about more than the prisoners' interests: it's about profit. One jail said that it buys e-cigs that lasts through 500 puffs for $2.75 and then sells them to inmates for $10 each. While that jail's goal is to give its guards a raise and make up for budget cuts, for others, it isn't clear exactly what their plans are for the new stream of revenue.",0.4784041772431001,0.5215958227569,0.816155121428611,259,4.9266409266409266,168,5.5,0,0,US & World,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

Snowden is currently living under asylum in Russia to avoid charges of espionage after he famously leaked thousands of documents outlining the alarming surveillance practices of the US government. Some lawmakers and civil liberties groups have called for the Obama administration to grant Snowden clemency for his actions, which put a spotlight on controversial data collection and mass snooping tactics of the NSA. President Obama himself recently said he doesn't have a straight yes or no answer as it relates to clemency for Snowden. ""This is an active case, where charges have been brought,"" he said during a wide-ranging interview with The New Yorker. But Attorney General Eric Holder has taken a much firmer stance; he says clemency is off the table, and it was never a plausible option to begin with. ""We’ve always indicated that the notion of clemency isn’t something that we were willing to consider,"" he said at the University of Virginia on Thursday. ""Instead, were he coming back to the US to enter a plea, we would engage with his lawyers."" Holder also makes it clear that Snowden wouldn't be given any special treatment. Despite the high profile nature of the case, those discussions would be the ""same with any defendant who wanted to enter a plea of guilty,"" he said. For his part, Snowden says he isn't coming back anytime soon — but he realizes it would be the preferred outcome for everyone involved. In an online Q&A yesterday, he said, ""Returning to the US, I think, is the best resolution for the government, the public, and myself, but it’s unfortunately not possible in the face of current whistleblower protection laws, which through a failure in law did not cover national security contractors like myself.""

The network is preparing to run episodes of Saturday Night Live for 19 days straight, starting with the most recent seasons and running back toward its first episodes. That means the network won't make it through SNL's complete history — for better or for worse — and is instead going to be selectively showing its best moments. Even so, VH1 says that this will still make for the longest-ever TV marathon dedicated to a single series.  Clear your schedule for the Justin Timberlake block The network is also going to be carving out blocks of time that'll be dedicated to specific sketches, hosts, and artists — there's one for Justin Timberlake, another for Wayne's World, and another for Chris Farley, for instance — so those will disrupt the chronological tour. The network is also cheating a little bit: it plans to run three movies starring former SNL members once each during the marathon. Nonetheless, it's still 19 days dedicated to SNL, which is an insane amount of time and really makes you wonder what VH1 Classic normally spends it time on. The intention of the marathon is to celebrate SNL's 40th anniversary, which is coming up later this year. The marathon will start Wednesday, January 28th and will conclude on Sunday, February 15th, with the final episode airing at 6:30PM that evening. NBC, which is owned by a totally different company than VH1, will air a three-hour anniversary special after the marathon concludes at 8PM. The timing is all totally arbitrary, as SNL's actual anniversary is in October. As ridiculous as it sounds to dedicate so much time to a single show, VH1 Classic may know what it's doing. When the FXX network ran its 12-day Simpsons marathon, it pulled in 25 million viewers — a figure that it should be very happy with. VH1 Classic is likely hoping for the same results with another classic series. VH1 proper will also air 10 hours of SNL retrospectives on the marathon's final day, and some episodes will be available to stream through VH1's website and on its app during the marathon. There's a good chance that we'll be seeing more SNL tributes as the year goes on. VH1 and NBC aren't even alone right now: an SNL exhibition featuring ""original scripts, set pieces, props, costumes, masks, and interactive elements"" is opening up in New York this spring.

Unsurprisingly, it's described as an attempt at a franchise — the 1981 original spawned a coolly-received sequel, a novelization, and a new comics series, but this is described as a completely new reboot. Escape From New York has been passed around Hollywood for the last several years. New Line Cinema originally bought the rights for a remake, but it passed to Joel Silver's Silver Pictures in 2013. Last year, rumors suggested that Silver Pictures was still working on the project, naming Sons of Anarchy's Charlie Hunnam, Downton Abbey's Dan Stevens, and The Walking Dead's Jon Bernthal as potential leads.

Variety says Pitt has been ""very passionate"" about getting a movie based on Lewis' non-fiction best-seller made, and that the big-screen adaptation will likely give its three megastars fairly equal billing and similarly sized roles.

Though they've yet to reach the hands of regular consumers, the headsets have already been evaluated by a preeminent expert in virtual reality therapy, or VRT, the practice of immersing patients in virtual realms to treat mental health problems. His verdict? ""They're a game changer for the work that we do."" ""I have no question that Oculus will revolutionize virtual reality for clinical purposes,"" Dr. Albert Rizzo, a research scientist at the University of California's Institute for Creative Technologies (ICT), told The Verge. ""This system is going to be about so much more than playing games."" Rizzo received an Oculus Rift developer's kit early, about six weeks before they shipped to other backers, because Oculus creator Palmer Luckey used to work as a technician in another lab at ICT.  Because of that early access, Rizzo has already tested the headset extensively — making him the first clinician to report assessing Oculus' potential in ""non-entertainment"" settings.  Indeed, Rizzo has something of an ideal background to evaluate new VR systems. In 2005, he developed first-of-its-kind virtual reality software designed to treat war veterans suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. His program, called Virtual Iraq, has since become a mainstay at several military medical centers as well as 55 Veterans Affairs clinics across the country. Rizzo has also developed another military-funded VRT program, meant to bolster soldiers' mental health before they deploy, that's currently being evaluated for widespread use. Several studies have shown that Rizzo's VRT protocol yields a significant reduction in PTSD symptoms, and current research is comparing its effectiveness to other therapeutic approaches. In addition to PTSD, other experts are either using or evaluating VRT programs to treat addiction, phobias, and anxiety disorders, among other mental health problems. Depending on the issue being addressed, VRT works in different ways — but the therapy is typically designed to mimic real-life scenarios that a patient struggles with. For war-related PTSD, patients use it to re-live combat situations, in an effort to assuage fearful associations linked to traumatic memories. For addiction, patients are confronted with triggers (a bar or a cigarette, for example) in an effort to cultivate and master their resistance strategies for cravings. ""The...idea is to get someone's head into it as much as you can"" Though the field of VRT continues to grow, Rizzo notes that it's been hampered by several factors. Namely, that virtual reality hardware remains costly — the systems used for Virtual Iraq run anywhere from $800 to $1,600 — and that the ability to fully immerse a patient is still limited. ""The technology isn't where we want it,"" he said. ""With exposure therapy and PTSD, the entire idea is to get someone's head into it as much as you can — we think that's what'll lead to better clinical outcomes."" Oculus Rift, given its low price and unprecedented realism, might very well solve both problems, Rizzo noted. He plans to recommend that treatment sites already using Virtual Iraq consider using Oculus Rift, and has already demoed the system to military clinicians at Joint Base Lewis-McCord. ""This has the capacity to turn virtual reality [therapy] into a mass market treatment,"" he said. ""I'm sure anyone doing this kind of clinical work will agree with me."" ""People think virtual reality is all about gaming."" We might soon find out: Luckey told The Verge that ""several hundred"" developers kits have recently been shipped to individuals in ""the military, as well as emergency response and medical training fields."" ""Once these guys have something to show, it'll be pretty amazing,"" Luckey said. ""People think virtual reality is all about gaming. But we really think that's only the beginning.""",0.6218676942490428,0.37813230575095724,0.8532381228438034,644,5.3059006211180124,372,6.327956989247312,0,0,Science,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Within these, seven new planets were found, and three of them are located in the sweet spot around their stars that makes it not too hot, nor too cold, for liquid water to exist on their surfaces. That fits one of two major criteria for what NASA considers a habitable planet, meaning that these three new worlds are technically capable of supporting the kinds of life we see here on Earth.    ""We believe that liquid water is crucial for life such as humans to develop."" ""We believe that liquid water is crucial for life such as humans to develop,"" said Steve Howell, project scientist for the Kepler mission, in an email to The Verge. ""There are many other life forms on our earth that may be okay without liquid water,"" he added. Howell said that eventually, scientists will attempt to use other instruments to detect light reflecting off the newly discovered planets, and from that light, ""detect signs of life, or at least signs of things we believe we need for life — water, CO2, etc."" Photo of technician assembling NASA's Kepler photometer instrument. Credit: Ball Aerospace But until then, NASA's Kepler mission is still the best shot we have of discovering places out there in the wider universe that are similar enough to Earth to be favorable to life. Kepler is an unmanned, tube-shaped spacecraft standing over 15 feet tall designed and built for NASA by Ball Aerospace company, created specifically to hunt for other planets (called ""exoplanets""), namely Earth-sized ones, by detecting the slight fluctuations in light that occur from a star when a planet crosses in front of it. ""only a small few are in the habitable zone."" Kepler's primary instrument is a light-measuring telescope, which is pointed at a specific area in the constellations Cygnus and Lyra that contains over 100,000 stars, around which an unknown number of planets, including at least a few habitable ones. In fact, since the spacecraft was launched into orbit trailing the Earth around the Sun four years ago, it's discovered 2,740 potential planets in this area of the sky, and 122 of these have been confirmed as planets by other different instruments. ""Of the 122 planets that have been confirmed, only a small few are in the habitable zone of their stars and even less are small enough to be likely a solid or rocky surface planet,"" Howell explained to The Verge. Specifically, only around 60 to 70, but as Howell added, ""most are around two times the Earth"" in size, ruling them out for the types of life we see here. Kepler's field of view in each of the four seasons, courtesy NASA/Kepler mission That brings up another important point about why the hunt for finding another candidate for life as we know it is so hard: the planet needs to be the right size. Too big (eight times the mass of Earth) and the gravity of the planet would be strong enough to trap hydrogen and helium, likely making it a gas giant, without a solid surface to support liquid water. Too small (half of Earth's mass or less), and the planet's gravity wouldn't be strong enough for an atmosphere at all, making it more like the moon. ""our best and closest discoveries to date of a planet like Earth."" Of Kepler's recently discovered seven new planets, only three were found to be both the right size and in the right spot to be able to conceivably support life. One of these, called Kepler-62f, is 40 percent larger than Earth, the closest in size yet to our homeworld found by the spacecraft. In total, since it first began its mission in 2009 and counting the three discovered last week, Kepler has only found five planets that are both the right size and in the right spot to be able to technically support types of life like we have on Earth.  ""Our best guess is that the planets announced [April 18, 2013] are our best and closest discoveries to date of a planet like Earth,"" Howell said. Still, Kepler is not done looking. The spacecraft was launched with a three-and-a-half-year long mission, but has already exceeded that by seven months and counting. It has suffered a few problems with its only moving parts — four wheels used to aim the telescope's view, but Howell and others hope it will continue functioning for more than double its intended lifetime. ""Kepler can possibly last another four years or so, assuming funding continues and the spacecraft and instrument suffer no catastrophic failures,"" Howell told The Verge. NASA, for one, thinks its a good investment too. Late last year, the agency granted Kepler continued funding through 2016. ""As humans, we are eager to learn if we are alone."" As for what use Kepler provides us here back on Earth, Howell is philosophic. ""As humans, we are eager to learn if we are alone,"" Howell pointed out. ""We have been since the dawn of time. Kepler is providing a census of one part of our galaxy to help answer that question. While we will not know if any particular exoplanet has life, we will know the frequency of such small, habitable zone planets. And if that number is high, it seems to me that we have to accept the verdict that we are not alone.""",0.6469971118975449,0.35300288810245506,0.8323075036773805,935,4.7080213903743315,438,5.8219178082191778,0,0,"Science, Report",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Researchers at MIT say they've successfully harnessed an obscure technique, called ""singlet exciton fission,"" that would reduce the amount of sunlight wasted as heat instead of being converted to electricity. In a typical solar cell, each photon of sunlight hitting the cell knocks loose one electron, to kickstart the process of energy conversion. In this new research, however, each photon knocks two electrons loose — making the process of solar energy generation more efficient. The process behind the research is relatively simple: researchers successfully coated solar cells with pentacene, an organic compound capable of generating two electrons from one photon.  The finding is particularly important because it may break what has, until now, been considered a fundamental barrier in solar energy efficiency: a calculation, known as the Shockley-Queisser limit, which posits that solar conversion will never exceed an efficiency level of 33.7 percent. And right now, top-notch commercial solar panels max out at around 25 percent efficiency. According to the MIT team, their technique will allow solar cells to transcend this limit. Unfortunately, that big moment isn't here just yet: the research is still in its early stages, with a proof-of-principle that maxes out at 2 percent efficiency.

By contrast, in birds, the illness caused by these viruses is only relatively mild. Other mutations found from the human virus samples indicated that they preferred to bind with human genes.

But in China, up to 40 percent of the people infected so far had no direct contact with birds, worrying the World Health Organization. Still, it's too early to say whether the new viruses will lead to a pandemic, according to the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), which funded the new research. “The H7N9 influenza virus is a new concern that the public health and scientific communities will continue to track closely, including watching for any genetic mutations that might enable the virus to become transmissible from person to person or to cause more severe disease,” said NIAID Director Anthony Fauci, M.D. in a statement published online today.

Published by the American Psychiatric Association (APA), the DSM offers detailed classifications and criteria for conditions like depression, anxiety disorders, and schizophrenia. Psychiatrists around the world consult it when treating patients, insurance companies use it to verify reimbursement claims, and criminal investigators use it to assess a suspect's mental health. Today, the DSM is widely referred to as the ""bible"" of psychiatry — but not everyone is a believer. The book has undergone four major revisions since first being published in 1952, with each one drawing varying degrees of criticism. The book's forthcoming fifth edition, known as DSM-5 and due to be published in May, has sparked a particularly fierce debate, prompting accusations of bias and recklessness on the part of the APA, and even eliciting calls for a boycott. ""Nothing to do with symptoms and everything to do with labeling"" ""I think the country is suffering from a glut of overdiagnosis and overmedication,"" Dr. Allen Frances, a professor emeritus at Duke University and outspoken DSM-5 critic, said in an interview with The Verge. ""This has nothing to do with symptoms and everything to do with labeling."" The major argument from Frances and others is that the DSM-5 lowers the thresholds for many diagnoses, and broadens the definitions of existing mental illnesses. Doing so, they argue, will exacerbate what many consider alarming trends in overdiagnosis and overmedication. Among the book's most controversial revisions are proposals to broaden the definition of depression, and to categorize childhood tantrums as a bona fide disorder. Each revision to the DSM is determined by a task force of doctors and researchers. Initially conceived as a reference book to standardize the terminology of known mental illnesses, the document eventually morphed into a more formalized diagnostic guide, beginning with the DSM-III in 1980. Dr. David Kupfer, a professor of neuroscience at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine and co-chair of the 31-member DSM-5 task force, says that the book provides professionals around the world with a common language, describing it as an ""invaluable tool."" ""for the DSM to masquerade as the public face of psychiatric science is ludicrous."" He insists that the book remains an ""evidence-based manual,"" noting that the task force published its proposed changes for professional and public review on two occasions before finalizing this latest edition. But Dr. Edward Shorter, a social historian of medicine at the University of Toronto, says that DSM deliberations have historically been more about ""horse trading"" in the name of consensus rather than scientific analysis. ""Each person [on the task force] says, 'you approve my diagnosis, and I'll approve yours,'"" Shorter explained, noting that the scope of the DSM's official disorders has nearly tripled since its first edition. ""This is normally not the way we do science. We didn’t have a consensus conference to find the speed of light."" He adds that ""for the DSM to masquerade as the public face of psychiatric science is ludicrous."" The book's revisions won't be official until its May 22nd release, but several major changes have already been confirmed. One of the most contentious is a new disorder called ""Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder""(DMDD) — a diagnosis for children aged 6 to 18 who exhibit ""temper outbursts that are grossly out of proportion in intensity or duration to the situation."" The idea is to stem the misdiagnosis of child bipolar disorder — a condition of dubious scientific merit — though some say that its broad language could incorrectly label youthful temper tantrums as symptomatic of a deeper problem. Another proposal calls for the removal of the ""bereavement exclusion"" — a provision in the DSM-IV that drew a distinction between depression and grief following the death of a loved one. The exclusion was nixed based on evidence that grief-related depression can be conflated with normal depression, but skeptics say it could encourage doctors to medicate away an otherwise natural emotion. Under the APA's new classification, patients still grieving two weeks after a funeral could be considered for a diagnosis of depression. Grief, or depression? Frances, who served as chairman of the DSM-IV task force, is widely recognized as the most outspoken critic of the APA's latest revisions. Like Shorter, he believes that the DSM-5 was largely based on unsound science and academic politics, and has taken issue with the strict confidentiality under which the proceedings unfolded. The decision to remove the bereavement exclusion, he says, is just one example of the APA's ""dangerous"" push to label harmless human behaviors as disorders — in this case, by turning ""normal grief into clinical depression."" Such a provision, he writes, will present a ""golden opportunity"" for drug companies to launch unfounded campaigns about grief-related depression, thereby entrenching new financial interests that may be difficult to reverse. Frances' campaign has spawned similar efforts elsewhere. The Society for Humanistic Psychology, a division of the American Psychological Association, launched a petition against the DSM-5 in 2011, echoing the British Psychological Society, which voiced similar concerns in a formal critique. In the US, some mental health professionals have even organized a boycott movement. Thus far, however, neither petition nor boycott have gained much traction, with both falling well below their stated goals.  DSM supporters cast Frances and his fellow critics as an outspoken minority in the psychiatric world, claiming that their rhetoric is blown out of proportion. Even Shorter acknowledges that the proposed changes to the DSM-5 don’t mark a dramatic departure from those introduced in the DSM-IV — the edition that Frances oversaw. In December, Kupfer told reporters that the new manual would contain roughly as many diagnoses as its predecessor, dispelling claims that it would drastically expand the definition of mental illness. Indeed, it seems as if Frances and other critics are using the forthcoming revision — the first in more than a decade — as an opportunity to attack the DSM and APA as an entity, rather than any specific set of changes. ""mental health professionals are not automatons.""   Psychologist John Grohol argues that critics of the DSM-5 overestimate its influence on clinical practitioners. ""The thing that critics don't seem to take into account is that mental health professionals are not automatons, they're not robots,"" he says. ""They don't just look a diagnosis up in a book and then apply the criteria without any subjectivity. That's just going against everything we know."" Dr. Peter Dozier, a pediatric psychiatrist at the Children's Hospital of the King's Daughters in Norfolk, Virginia, says he consults the DSM at least ""several times a week,"" but only to look up the diagnostic codes required for medical billing and insurance forms. He adds that although the book can be useful in teaching residents how to recognize certain clusters of symptoms, the DSM ""does not occupy a holy place on my desk."" But Frances' concerns go beyond the clinic. He and his supporters warn that the DSM has become too powerful, and that its influence has spread into non-diagnostic domains. Some health benefits, for instance, are determined according to whether or not a patient is diagnosed with a DSM-approved disorder, as are court decisions on a suspect's mental state. In January, a Missouri man filed a lawsuit against the APA and the St. Louis police department, claiming that officers wrongfully placed him in a mental institution on the basis of the DSM's diagnostic criteria. Some say that a better alternative would be to adopt the World Health Organization's international standards, or to do away with the DSM altogether and start from scratch. But as Grohol points out, establishing the causality between overdiagnosis and a single book can be a daunting, if not impossible task. ""A publisher can't be held responsible for how people use or misuse something they publish,"" he explains. ""That's just not American.""",0.5109061146661407,0.48909388533385934,0.8778706891430338,1322,5.3479576399394855,675,6.9881481481481478,0,0,"Science, Report",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

In a press conference, NASA announced a series of discoveries from its Kepler probe program, revealing the existence of three planets that appear to be in the orbital ""habitable zone"" that could support liquid water. Since they also exist in systems anchored by sun-like stars, the planets are among the strongest candidates for supporting life, though researchers are just beginning to explore the implications of their discovery. The three planets were discovered orbiting two different stars. Two of them, Kepler-62e and Kepler-62f, are anchored around a star somewhat smaller and cooler than our sun, while a third orbits Kepler-69, a star similar to Earth's. NASA isn't calling the planets ""Earth-like"" exactly; instead, they're described as ""Super Earths"" that are anywhere from 40 to 70 percent larger than our planet. However, that's still much smaller than the habitable zone planets that have been discovered so far, including predecessor Kepler-22b. The smallest, shown above, is Kepler-69f, believed to be a rocky planet based on its size; there's also the possibility of water. The larger Kepler-69e could be either rocky or a ""water world,"" and the even bigger Kepler-69c is described as potentially a ""Super Venus,"" situated on the hotter side of the habitable zone. ""What it shows you is the diversity we're discovering out there."" As of this January, the Kepler mission had uncovered 2,740 planet candidates, and scientists are increasingly finding that smaller planets in the habitable zone are more common than once believed. As a NASA panel conceded, it's not inconceivable that we could find life on a planet different to our own, or one orbiting a non-sun-like star. But looking for environments like our own is a way to narrow the search, and it can give us insights about Earth. Finding Earth-like planets, says Harvard astronomer Lisa Kaltenegger, is a way to see what our own planet might be going. It's also a way to visualize different types of solar systems: if Kepler-62e is indeed a water planet, it would be unlike anything in our own solar system.

The Washington Post reports that in October, the Aberdeen Proving Ground military base plans to start a three-year test of how surveillance aerostats (essentially large, tethered balloons) could improve missile defense systems on the Eastern Seaboard. The two craft would float up to 10,000 feet above the ground for 30 days at a time, and their attached radar system is supposed to be able to detect airborne objects from up to 340 miles away — which means it could reach as far as Boston — and vehicles on the surface from up to 140 miles away, closer to the distance between the base and New York City. The aerostats, designed by defense contractor Raytheon, can be mounted with extremely sensitive sensors that can capture a live video feed of vehicles from ""dozens"" of miles away. But the Army denies that it has any current plans to mount cameras or infrared sensors, nor to share the information it captures with law enforcement at any level, though the Post reports that it wouldn't rule either possibility out. The system has previously been tested in Utah, where small planes simulated the flight of missiles, and similar tests will be carried out in Maryland. The Raytheon system, known as JLENS, is meant to quickly detect flying objects, like missiles, that might be difficult or impossible to see from the ground in time to alert officials of an attack on the nearby capital.

The promised new rules may pave the way for future state initiatives on weed that mirror those in Colorado and Washington. According to Holder, the Justice and Treasury Departments are collaborating on the regulations to ease the anxiety of banks unwilling to work with weed merchants for fear of being prosecuted. As a result, the money such businesses make would end up ""lying around."" ""You don’t want just huge amounts of cash in these places,"" said Holder.

A Justice Department official stated after the talk that these rules would not be enforceable in court, but are rather meant as guidance for prosecutors and federal law enforcement. However, that the administration is encouraging banks to do business with pot sellers indicates that, while marijuana is still illegal on the federal level, interest in prosecuting the sale of the drug may wane if banks start to see more profit from its sale.

Lee's film is a big grab for Vimeo Digital distribution is slowly becoming more common for feature films — especially for low-budget matters like this. In particular, indie films are often released digitally or on VOD platforms before entering theaters as a way to increase buzz. That's been done with some major directors — like Lars Von Trier, with Nymphomaniac — but it's still rare for a marketable name like Lee to head straight online. Vimeo is streaming the movie in the US, Canada, and Puerto Rico. It's $9.99 to rent and $14.99 to purchase. Da Sweet Blood of Jesus may be more suited to an online release. The film was funded through a Kickstarter campaign in 2013, so there are fans out there who will likely jump at the opportunity to watch it early online. The apparent eccentricity of this new film may also lend to an online release, allowing Da Sweet Blood of Jesus to gain some steam before it's in theaters. Lee's latest is a vampire pic, though he prefers not to call it one: rather, it's a modern ""love story"" about people who become addicted to blood and want to live forever. It's supposed to explore the nature of ""love, addiction, sex, and status"" in today's society. The film is also a big grab for Vimeo. Vimeo has been operating a paid section of its website for a little while now, but it hasn't seen a lot of attention. To be fair, most people likely found out that YouTube sold and rented movies just a couple weeks ago when it debuted The Interview, but that just goes to show how hard of a time these streaming services are having at finding audiences for paid content.

Universal's new supernatural horror flick, Unfriended (previously known as Cybernatural) looks like it's pushing the envelope, though, by plotting the entire film — paranormal activity and all — on a screencapped desktop. Think of this as the Skype session from Hell Think of Unfriended, then, as the Skype session from Hell. The film, directed by Levan Gabriadze, is perfectly basic on a surface level: a white teenaged girl is ridiculed by her white teenaged peers, kills herself, and, one year later, her spirit returns to seek revenge on her tormenters. This all sounds really, really '90s. But what's somewhat innovative is that the entire plot is conveyed by way of online applications we use everyday, touching on painfully real problems of our time in the process. Rape shaming, doxing, teen suicide, and hacking all converge on a single computer screen in truly disturbing ways, and makes the haunting later on in the trailer feel all the more unsettling. Even if the set pieces are pretty ridiculous.   Now, no one is suggesting that Unfriended looks like a particularly good movie. It's still a run-of-the-mill teen horror flick with a timely gimmick that manages to trivialize the real suffering of people for jump scares. That's something horror movies routinely do. But it can at least be said that the film's conceit is inventive enough to make the it worth keeping track of.

""I don’t know how I got into this,"" Allen says in a statement. ""I have no ideas and I’m not sure where to begin."" Without seeing a single episode or announcing a single casting decision, Amazon has ordered an entire season of a TV show to be written and directed entirely by Allen. The series will consist of half-hour episodes, though Amazon hasn't yet said how many. There's no title for the show either, nor is there a description of what it'll be about. It'll debut on Prime Instant Video during 2016 in the US, UK, and Germany.  Allen's films have been on an upswing in recent years ""Woody Allen is a visionary creator who has made some of the greatest films of all-time, and it’s an honor to be working with him on his first television series,"" Roy Price, Amazon Studios VP, says in a statement. Allen jokes, ""My guess is that Roy Price will regret this."" Allen has written and directed a new movie pretty much every year for decades now. Though they've been of varying quality — from masterpieces like Annie Hall to a handful of clunkers — he's very much been on an upswing lately, finding some of his biggest successes in recent years with films like Midnight in Paris and Blue Jasmine. That appears to have been enough to give Amazon faith in whatever project he dreams up for it. Amazon is also beginning to find success in comedy, and this is an opportunity to bolster that in a major way. Amazon doesn't say what the funding will be like for Allen's TV series, but it very much seems like the studio was willing to do whatever it takes — even so far as committing to an entire season before much work has been put into the show — in order to land Allen. Allen typically operates on small budgets (his films have never brought in that much for studios), but he's also been able to bring on terrific actors simply because they're willing to take the pay cut just to work with him. While a television series would be a larger time commitment, it's possible that scoring Allen also means that Amazon will be able to bring on actors with a star power that it otherwise couldn't afford. While Allen is a huge catch for Amazon, which has been trying to scoop up major talent for its series, he will not come without controversy. Over the past two decades, an allegation of child abuse against Allen has continued to resurface, with the matter once again entering the spotlight just under a year ago when the alleged victim published a harrowing open letter in The New York Times. Allen has been cleared of charges and the issue has once again left the spotlight, but it is not unlikely for Amazon to receive criticism for choosing to support him. Allen has another film due out later this year, starring Emma Stone and Joaquin Phoenix. Given that his films are made so close together, it's possible that 2016 could be the first year in a while without a Woody Allen movie.

But today the company announced that it's going to give FiOS TV customers greater choice over which channels they're receiving (and paying for). Beginning Sunday, the new ""Custom TV"" packages will start with a $65 bundle that pairs internet service with 35 TV channels. (The TV half can be purchased alone for $55 each month.) This one checks off the basics like ABC, Fox AMC, CNN, and Food Network. But if you want more programming, you'll be able to purchase $10 add-ons with additional channels. Sound familiar? Verizon is pretty much applying the Sling TV formula to its FiOS business. Dish's internet TV service starts at $20 per month, but offers more content in small, themed channel packs that add $5 onto the base price. You don't have to pay the ESPN tax anymore With Verizon, customers can switch between channel packs every month, and they'll almost definitely want to expand on the core bundle a bit. ESPN is split off as part of the sports add-on, and some bigger channels like USA and TNT also require an added purchase. Thankfully, two add-ons of your choice come as part of the monthly price — and they contain more channels than Sling's bonus packs. Expect between 10 and 17 additional channels in each Verizon pack. Will you actually end up saving any money this way? Perhaps not, but Verizon is patting itself on the back for offering more flexibility. ""While this is not all-the-way a la carte, customers have the ability to consolidate and collapse the kind of content they want to view,"" Tami Erwin, Verizon's president of FiOS, told The Wall Street Journal. Verizon takes the same line as everyone else in the cable business when it comes to proper a la carte; the company insists the freedom of choosing individual channels would result in costs higher than consumers would want to pay.

My cousins lived in the big city, and the majority of my schoolmates were in another town, so I ended up developing single-player versions of most board games. All it took was a little bit of imagination and a healthy disregard for the social norms imposed by the default game rules. Now I’m living in the constantly connected world of social apps, and, wouldn’t you know it, I’m still coming up with single-person varieties of experiences that are supposed to be shared. And I think more people should give it a try.  The first rule of social apps is that you can never have enough friends. Let's break it. The first rule of social networking apps is that you can never have enough connections. I once gave LinkedIn a fake name and an old email address just to read an article posted to it, and it continues to dredge up the most ancient (and fleeting) acquaintances of my life. Remember the help desk clerk from college whom you emailed exactly once? LinkedIn does, and it really wants you to network up. Twitter is the same way, with the initiation procedures for setting up its mobile app designed to get you to accidentally follow a bunch of people. And if you use Google+ with only a few friends, you’ll get an interstitial ad urging you to round up more humans. All of this social recruitment feels exhausting, but you can work your way past it. Disable a few notifications, decline a few ""but you’ll be lonely!"" dialogs, and you can begin using the apps to your own purposes. Here’s the thing: social apps happen to be the most versatile and capable mobile software we have available. We take it for granted that we can post instant updates and upload images from anywhere, and that we can return to those archives from anywhere else. The first step to that combination, which we might call the Snapchat component, is indeed easy, however keeping an organized and comprehensive history of everything you’ve posted is a costly affair. Not everyone has the funds for vast server farms to host your countless image and video uploads for free. Social apps usually do. This crystallized for me this past weekend when I set out to find a good app for keeping a food journal. I don’t want to lose weight or gain muscle, I don’t want others to judge the healthfulness of my meals or estimate my calorie intake — I just want to compile a photo archive. For my own gratification and no one else’s. That immediately disqualified pretty much every dedicated food app out there. They all try to do and track too much, and most don’t have the finances to maintain a free image archive online. Evernote Food has a piddling 60MB monthly upload limit for free accounts, meaning I’d have to either pay for a subscription or starve for half the month. Other dedicated apps degrade image quality to keep things manageable. I’m using a social app completely antisocially and benefiting from it And then my search led me to Path. Path puts a time stamp on every post and lets me annotate with the list of ingredients. It’s perfect for what I want to do. I only want a simple visual history and, provided I don’t let anybody in on my Path activities, it’s the cleanest and simplest way of doing it. That’s right, I’m using a social app completely antisocially and benefiting from it. I guess these are the perks of not reading the instructions. A friendless account on Instagram, Facebook, or Google Photos (née Google+) would probably work just as well. The advantage of these established names is that I know they’ll keep my photos backed up and safe over the long term. Twitter’s another good example: just protect your tweets from external eyes and you have a cross-platform, rapid-fire note-taking app. Businesses have long used social networks in quirky and unusual ways to project their brands to a wider audience. What I’m urging is that we, the users, start to think a little less linearly, too. The race for retweets and favorites can be addictive, but it’s not the only application for these powerful apps at our disposal. If we break a few of the implicit rules, we can fashion out our own, truly personal timelines, taking advantage of the services that more often exploit us and our pseudo-social activity. Give it a shot. Take the social out of social apps and see how much is left. You might be pleasantly surprised.",0.6132629837465874,0.3867370162534126,0.1856521340552558,784,4.7142857142857144,433,5.956120092378753,0,0,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Last night, Department of Public Safety spokesman DL Wilson compared the current scene in West to the damage sustained by McVeigh’s target, the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building. At this point, over 100 people are reported to have been injured in the blast, with at least five believed dead.  ""Water, under certain conditions, will set off anhydrous ammonia."" It’s still unclear whether ammonium nitrate, other chemicals, or a combination, were responsible for the blast at West Fertilizer. Many media reports so far have focused on the presence of anhydrous ammonia, one of the components used to make ammonium nitrate. Physicist Michio Kaku told CBS News that water from fire hoses could have reacted with the anhydrous ammonia on the premises. ""Water, under certain conditions, will set off anhydrous ammonia,"" he explained. ""The hose water might have set off the anhydrous ammonia, creating a chain reaction."" Under normal conditions, ammonia is not explosive. Hot pools of ammonium nitrate can form when it's confined Likewise, ammonium nitrate is rated as non-flammable and since it doesn’t detonate under normal conditions (i.e., when it’s not in the presence of fuel oil), it’s generally regarded to be safe. However, an Australian government report notes that in a fire, hot pools of ammonium nitrate can form when the chemical is confined, making it very sensitive to shock if it comes in contact with other flammable or combustible materials, oil, metals, or other chemicals. It is also a strong oxidizing agent, supplying oxygen to the fuel in a fire even when there’s no air available. That strong oxidizing property can even risk causing combustible materials like paper and oil to ignite. There's a lengthy history of deadly, accidental ammonium nitrate explosions, including the Texas City disaster of 1947, when a cargo ship being loaded with ammonium nitrate caught fire and exploded, killing at least 576 and leveling much of the town, still considered the deadliest industrial accident in US history. But there have been at least 17 major fatal ammonium nitrate explosions around the globe since 1921, as The Guardian reports. Many have occurred overseas, including in France and Australia. A University College of London organic chemistry professor just happened to be nearby one of these such explosions in Toulouse, France, and recalled the incident at Chemistry World magazine, saying: ""I had previously heard three terrorist explosions in London, UK. I had also witnessed some pretty substantial bangs during my time as a graduate student or while doing lecture demonstrations. But this was different. This was big."" For the people of West, Texas, the story is still unfolding. Rescue teams are still searching for the missing, and Police Sgt. William Patrick Swanton is telling the press that it will be a slow process going forward. ""It is tedious, it is time consuming, it is a very methodical process they are doing.""

New research, published yesterday in the journal mBio, supports the theory that this is due to decreased levels of bacteria. The paper shows that circumcision dramatically lowers the amount of bacteria in the area, which could be the reason for the increased resistance when compared to uncircumcised males. The research team responsible from the study at the Translational Genomics Research Institute in Arizona looked at the levels of bacteria in over 156 uncircumcised men aged 15 to 49. Half of the volunteers were then circumcised, while the other half were not. After one year, there was an average 81-percent reduction in bacteria in the circumcised men. The team concludes that removing the foreskin positively changes the penile ecosystem by increasing the amount of oxygen that reaches the previously-covered skin. This in turn greatly decreases the prevalence of anaerobic bacteria (although slightly increases aerobic bacteria levels), reducing the risk of inflammation that can make HIV infection more likely. Although the team didn't directly look at HIV risks, the research suggests that the lower level of anaerobic bacteria ""may play a role in HIV risk reduction."" The fact that circumcised people are less likely to contract HIV represents one of very few cases where modifying the body's natural form can have positive effects on health.

I was terrified at [its] resilience.”  This gory description could have been one of many zombie survivor stories from the novel World War Z, but it’s actually a man’s factual description the tenacity of a rabid raccoon he beat to death with a hammer in the non-fiction book Rabid. Many people are familiar with Max Brooks’ 2006 best-seller World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War (soon to be a film starring Brad Pitt), a novel about a global pandemic. People are probably less familiar with the 2012 non-fiction book by Wired Senior Editor Bill Wasik and veterinarian Monica Murphy, Rabid: A Cultural History of the World’s Most Diabolical Virus 9 (a 5,000 word excerpt can be found here). If Rabid walks us through humanity’s two thousand year history of trying (and failing) to cure this horrifying disease, World War Z shows us what the consequences of failing could be. Connecting zombies to rabies isn’t a stretch, it turns out. Rabies is a real and terrifying neurological disease that, when contracted in humans, can make the victim appear zombie-like (fatigue, vision disturbances, slurred speech, loss of coordination) and, if the infection reaches the brain, it is one of the few diseases that is 100 percent fatal and for which there is still no known cure. Once bitten by an infected animal, the human victim begins showing symptoms much like the flu, becoming weak, feverish, and plagued by headaches for several days. If caught in the early acute stages, the virus can be treated with a vaccine and human immune globulin injections, but left untreated, the victim will begin exhibiting stronger feelings of anxiety and confusion, alternating between mania and sluggishness. As the virus spreads and infects the central nervous system, delirium and hallucinations set in, leading to death and the brain and spinal cord ultimately become fatally inflamed. The most recent World Health Organization numbers, updated in 2013, show that there are still over 55,000 deaths due to rabies every year, primarily centred in Asia and Africa. Fewer than five cases are reported per year in the US. If World War Z weren’t so liberal with the use of the word zombie, one could be lulled into thinking it’s a non-fiction book. Told through a series of interviews with survivors of a global pandemic ten years after the initial outbreak, the novel’s clinical approach was inspired by Studs Terkel’s oral history of World War II, The Good War. While Max Brooks’ previous book Zombie Survival Guide was packed with practical knowledge (“The trench spike is the best compact anti-zombie weapon on earth”), World War Z opts for a more analytical perspective and a series of unreliable narrators. It begs the reader to think harder about the subject than they might otherwise. Where World War Z entertains, Rabid educates. In 1953, Richard Matheson, inspired in part by the movie Werewolf of London, wrote the iconic novel I Am Legend (yes, the one that became the Will Smith movie). It was a novel nominally about vampires, but not the rural cape-wearing paramours popular up until then. Matheson pitted a lone protagonist researching and testing a cure for a global pandemic that created a horde of base, animalistic vampires. Sound familiar? Matheson’s vampires are the embryonic version of the modern day zombie. Zombie master George Romero even admits he “basically ripped off” Matheson in writing one his first short stories about a dystopian world of the undead. In Rabid, Bill Wasik and Monica Murphy actually name check World War Z in a chapter-length overview of the history of zombies and how they connect to rabies through their sister-monster: the vampire. Yes, zombies, part of our culture for less than a century, find their roots in the thousands of years old myths of vampires. There’s not just a casual relationship between the virus and the monster: zombies and their much older cousins, vampires, share a causal connection. Spanish physician Juan Gomez-Alonso explains four connections between rabies and vampire myths in a 1998 Neurology journal article, the most obvious being infection through the blood via bites. Rabies victims also often suffer from facial spasms, lending them an animalistic appearance. The third connection is the time frame: vampire lore had them living for forty days before being turned, the same amount of time it usually takes for the victim of a rabies attack to die after their initial bite. The final connection is probably the most surprising: sex drive. The insatiable sexual desire that’s a trademark of both traditionally gothic and sparkly modern vampires can also be traced to rabies. Male rabies victims often get involuntary erections and have spontaneous orgasms. Unsurprisingly, this was not often spoken of outright, but was alluded to in much of the early medical literature, with one eighteenth century Austrian physician noting “his seed and his life were lost at the same time.” The myth of vampires, imbued with traits of rabies victims, was popularized long before we fully understood rabies. Even further back than the vampire is a tale that is part myth, part metaphor: in Homer’s epics, the Trojan hero and Achilles’ foe Hector has a strong fury akin to primal possession that made him terrifying and superhuman on the battlefield. The word used to describe his state is lyssa. As Wasik and Murphy describe it in Rabid: “Lyssa was rare, terrifying, violent, and animalistically destructive of self. It made creatures maim and kill those closest to them. It hollowed out reason and left nothing but frenzy.” In Attic Greek (the prestige dialect of Ancient Greek that was spoken in Attica) lyssa literally translates to rabies. World War Z has its own version of the lyssa crazed warriors: quislings. Quislings were once humans, reduced below a feral state into thinking and acting as zombies. It’s an involuntary coping mechanism on the part of some weak-willed percentage of the population. They were so ingrained with the idea they were zombies, they’d lay motionless while they were eaten alive. We personify and mythologize what we fear to try to understand it in whatever way we can. Considering the high (100 percent) rate of fatality for rabies in the advanced stage, it’s seen its own share of placebo ‘cures’ throughout the ages, most of which have amounted to a mixture of palliative treatment and wishful thinking. Ancient recommended treatments outlined in Rabid include bleeding and then cauterizing the wound with clarified butter which the patient would then drink, applying a sesame paste to the wound, and then being fed a cake made of rice, roots, and leaves. The cauterization and bleeding make as much sense as anything, the rest is a comfort. Even today the best treatments are still unproven. In 2004, 15 year-old Jeanna Giese was transferred to the care of Milwaukee physician Rodney Willoughby who confirmed with the Center for Disease Control (CDC) that she had rabies. Knowing there was no proven effective treatment, he proposed something unorthodox: since rabies seems to kill the brain faster than it kills the body, put the patient into a medically induced coma to give the body a fighting chance to kill the disease on its own. To everyone’s surprise it worked. No one knows whether it was the coma, the drug used, or Jeanna’s innate predisposition to survive. But after a week-long coma and several weeks of rehabilitation, Jeanna was able to leave the hospital. This treatment is now called the Milwaukee protocol. World War Z never specifies exactly what disease caused the zombie plague or whether a cure was developed. One chapter, however, features a pharmaceutical bigshot who had developed a vaccine that turns out to be a glorified placebo. “We knew it would work against rabies, and that’s what they said it was, right, just some weird strain of jungle rabies. […] We never lied, you understand? They told us it was rabies, so we made a vaccine for rabies. We said it had been tested in Europe, and the drugs it was based on had been tested in Europe. It protected them from their fears. That’s all I was selling.” Just because the “cure” in World War Z may have been a placebo doesn’t mean it wasn’t a panacea. For people who took the placebo and who were then bitten by quislings, the zombie play-acting humans, the fact that they didn’t become infected was enough to stave off a national panic. Which goes to show, as anyone who’s seen the destruction caused by panic will tell you, a placebo can be almost as good as a cure. World War Z doesn’t attempt to cure the zombies of their rabies-like disease, with author Max Brooks preferring to find hope in the silver lining of a society ably adapting to a world with zombies. Which is why the scariest part of either book is this section towards the end of Rabid about where rabies research stands today, despite some early success with the Milwaukee protocol: “Nevertheless, the medical establishment remains largely skeptical. At the time of his original publication, Willoughby declared his intention to set up animal studies to test some of his claims. […] Six and a half year later, these studies have yet to materialize. The basic reason is financial: Willoughby has not received enough funding to undertake the research himself, and meanwhile no other rabies researcher has made such efforts a priority.” A deadly but overlooked disease. No money for scientific research. A lone doctor throwing up his hands. The medical establishment turning away from him. … Isn’t this how zombie movies start?",0.5025183871520369,0.4974816128479631,0.865982142857009,1622,5.0363748458692967,854,6.365339578454333,0,0,,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The company says it spent $500 million and 17 years studying a pair of genes called BRCA1 and BRCA2 that indicate an increased risk of breast and ovarian cancer. After half a billion dollars in investment, Myriad wants to own the genes — both its current process of testing for them, and any other tests that might isolate the same gene. For the past three years, Myriad has been defending those patents in court, culminating in this week's arguments before the highest court in the country. ""Life's instructions ought not be controlled by legal monopolies."" The problem is, the law won’t let you patent something if it’s a ""product of nature."" To most observers, that describes DNA pretty well. In arguments, justices joked about patenting the kidney, or atomic energy, but even they didn't reach the most ambitious levels of metaphor. No less than James D. Watson, official co-discoverer of DNA, found himself telling the court, ""Life's instructions ought not be controlled by legal monopolies."" It's a familiar line of argument; as Jonas Salk famously said about patenting the polio vaccine, ""Could you patent the sun?"" But after the final arguments have been made, the justices, far from dismissive of the right to patent genes, were skeptical and cautious. If the predictions of court-watchers hold, the final ruling is likely to fall short of the sweeping condemnation many observers were hoping for, leaving many avenues for gene patents still open. One possibility suggested by the Justice Department is to limit the patents to cDNA, an edited version of the DNA that’s injected into a cell to produce a specific protein. That would provide some incentive for the first person to isolate a gene, but leave any given sequence of DNA open for research. But it dodges the larger question: how did the building block of life become so easily bought and sold? Mapping a person's whole genome is still too error-prone and expensive The idea of genetic patents grows directly out of the way most human genome research is conducted. Despite the falling price of sequencing, it still costs thousands of dollars to sequence an entire genome. As a result, mapping a person's whole genome is too expensive and error-prone to work in most clinical settings. Instead, labs chop up chromosomes and look for unique strings of nucleotide that they can isolate and study. If the studies turn up something useful, researchers can easily test patient DNA for the same string, effectively divorced from the rest of the genome. In many cases, the patent-holders don't even know where on the chromosome the patented gene is. They don't need to. As long as they've got a workable test, they can build studies around it, and build a meaningful tool for doctors and patients from there. To a CEO, this process looks like something you should patent. After investing lots of time and money, researchers created something (in this case, a medical test) that has real value for patients, value that was shored up by arduous and extensive testing. If it were a special kind of X-ray that told patients about their risk of breast cancer, the case would be open and shut. But because genes are involved, drawing the line gets complicated fast. The expensive and difficult work is isolating the gene itself. In exchange for that, companies want a patent The simple answer — and one the ACLU has suggested many times in pressing the case — is just to patent the test, but for many companies, that's not enough. The test itself is nothing special. It would be too easy for a rival company to circumvent the patent by developing an alternate test for the same string of nucleotides. As the field develops, new sequencing methods are bound to develop, and researchers want a patent that can survive the next generation of testing technology. The expensive and difficult work is isolating the gene itself, and doing the clinical tests that establish its meaning. In exchange for that work, companies like Myriad want the protection of a patent. As the BRCA genes became more important, Myriad decided to break the truce Traditionally, they've gotten it. Patents have been granted on genes for decades. The first official DNA patent came in 1982, when a trio of University of California scientists isolated the cDNA strand to produce human growth hormone. The university, eager for profit, licensed it to biotech companies like Lilly and Genentech for a new generation of HGH treatments. For the most part, patent-holders taken care to stay on the right side of the research community, offering free licenses and not enforcing most of the rights associated with their patents. Since most of the research was in such an early stage, this was a cheap concession. But as the BRCA genes became increasingly important in preventative breast cancer testing, Myriad decided to break the truce. It started aggressively enforcing the BRCA patents, serving violation notices to labs that performed infringing tests. Labs still performed the test (it was too effective to ignore), but they had to license it from Myriad, which made the test more expensive and less common. Even worse, anyone who wanted to research the gene had to get Myriad’s approval, which throttled the usual flow of research.  If it sounds bad in broad strokes, the specifics are even worse. In one case that the ACLU has aggressively pushed, a woman received a negative result from Myriad’s BRCA test only to discover, years later, that she had a BRCA mutation that Myriad hadn’t studied. Since Myriad didn’t study it, no one could, and there was no effective test for her unique mutation. In the meantime, a relative’s ovarian cancer advanced to the point of being inoperable, with no evidence that she was genetically at-risk. Would a patent-free system have inspired the research that would have saved her life? The woman certainly thinks so, and her case, among others, has spurred medical associations into a full fledged legal battle. The American Medical Association and AARP have already sided against Myriad, and dozens of smaller medical groups have signed on in their wake. 41 percent of identified genes fall under some patent And while Myriad is the most visible case, they're not the only bad actor. Below the radar, you'll find a host of companies that exist mostly to accumulate and license patents, often offering no more than a connection to an established protein. 41 percent of identified genes fall under some patent or another, which presents a growing problem for genetics research. The new wave of personal genomics companies like 23andme fall into an even stranger place, using open tests to entice customers, but potentially generating revenue from their own portfolio of patents. Depending on how the court rules, they could end up either facing a dwindling supply of open-source genes, or having to rewrite their business model entirely. In the end, 30 years worth of gene patents is a lot to overturn, and while the justices seem skeptical of the genetic patent system, they also seem wary of too large an overhaul — especially one that might stunt investment in the growing biotech field. But it's hard to predict what will become restrictive as the field develops, or how the Supreme Court will parse the science of the case. The Court is expected to issue its decision in late June; until then, all Myriad and others can do is wait.",0.40905466736115026,0.5909453326388497,0.8315434852629794,1280,4.95703125,632,6.1661392405063289,0,0,"Policy & Law, Science, Report",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The pledge to reduce office space emissions extends to all these companies offices in the New York City area, including leased office spaces. The companies join another 17 universities and 11 hospitals in New York that previously took the pledge, four of which have already met their goals, as the mayor's office noted.

""When pollsters ask Americans what share of the budget goes to aid,"" Gates says, ""the average response is 25 percent."" When those same people are asked how much the government should spend on aid, people tend to say 10 percent. The actual figure is less than one percent of the budget. Gates breaks that 1 percent — roughly $30 billion — down further. $11 billion is spent on health, the vaccines, drugs, bed nets, and other life-saving items that the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation centers much of its attention on providing, giving a figure of around $5,000 ""per child saved."" Less than 1 percent of the US budget goes to development aid Particularly notable in the letter is an indirect criticism of the government's apportioning of its budget. Gates juxtaposes the amount spent on aid against farm subsidies — given twice as much of the budget as development aid — and the military, which receives 60 times as much funding, against that spent helping those less fortunate. He ends his letter on a call to action.

Chatham House and the Center for International Governance Innovation (CIGI) announced the 25-member commission at the World Economic Forum in Davos, calling on them to investigate how to balance civil rights, appropriate regulation, online threats, and economic interests. The panel's work includes answering general questions about the future of the internet, but in a release, its founders cite two particular areas of concern. First, a number of authoritarian states are waging a campaign to exert greater state control over critical internet resources. Second, revelations about the nature and extent of online surveillance have led to a loss of trust. Collectively, these circumstances have created a need to update legacy mechanisms for internet governance; but deadlocks in international dialogue mean the potential exists for the fragmentation of the internet. Russia, Turkey, and other countries have increasingly cracked down on the web in recent years, and the possibility of authoritarian state-by-state control was an issue in 2012's internet governance debate. Over the last year, though, former NSA contractor Edward Snowden has released documents suggesting that the US and UK have tapped into internet backbone connections to gather information, among other surveillance efforts. ""Revelations about the nature and extent of online surveillance have led to a loss of trust."" The Global Commission on Internet Governance, as the panel is called, is one of many projects to investigate internet surveillance, but it's notable for its independence from government agencies and its high-profile members. It's chaired by Swedish foreign minister Carl Bildt, and other members include venture capitalist and former Apple Europe manager Pascal Cagni, White House Open Government Initiative founder Beth Simone Noveck, influential political scientist and National Intelligence Council chair Joseph Nye, and several members of think tanks and a variety of national internet associations. The list also includes Michael Chertoff, former Secretary of Homeland Security and co-author of the Patriot Act. As the commission kicks off, White House spokesperson Jay Carney has said that Obama administration officials are ""hard at work"" on the reforms that were promised last week, and that they are attempting to meet the two-month deadline for presenting a way to move phone records out of the government's direct control. His response contrasts with the opinion of some present and former officials, who told The Washington Post that the timeline was ""very unlikely, if not impossible."" Most of the direct changes will have to go through agencies like the NSA or FBI, despite the efforts of Congress to introduce reform. One of the most outspoken critics of surveillance, Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT) used his platform at Davos to reiterate a common refrain: that the NSA's efforts have sacrificed American privacy without concrete benefits. ""In the United States, which should be one of the freest countries to express yourself, we are collecting far too much information,"" he said in a panel discussion.

The $61 million used for lobbying between the ten companies is an increase of 16 percent since 2012, in which they spent a collective $52.78 million. 2013's biggest spender remained Google, but the $14.06 million the search giant put towards Washington was actually a decrease in outlay of 14.7 percent from the previous year, when it was the target of an antitrust investigation. The firm's lobbying costs looked to be trending upwards at the end of 2013: after a decrease in relative third quarter spending, Google's fourth quarter expenses rose from $3.35 million to $3.98 million. Seven of the ten companies on the list increased their lobbying spend from 2012 to 2013 Seven of the ten companies on the list increased their spending on lobbying. Microsoft increased its budget 30 percent from 2012, spending $10.49 million last year. Amazon was up 38.3 percent to $3.46 million, IBM leaped 45.6 percent to $7.06 million, while Yahoo's one percent increase pushed its spending to $2.78 million. Facebook and Apple had the largest rises in lobby spending: the former was up 61.2 percent to $6.43 million, while the latter jumped almost 72 percent to $3.37 million. The increase in lobbying spend comes as the United States' largest technology companies increase their political efforts. Among the group, Facebook has been particularly active. In April last year, Mark Zuckerberg launched FWD.us with other Silicon Valley executives to push for immigration reform. In November, the Facebook CEO took his political advocacy to ABC's This Week, discussing NSA surveillance and directly criticizing the government's Healthcare.gov.

By way of comparison, the Times cites China's summer olympiad in 2008 as the nearest competitor, coming in at roughly $40 billion, but the real eyebrow raiser is when you compare the 2014 Winter Games to their 2010 precursor: Vancouver is estimated to have spent around $6 billion on hosting the competition. With plans for Sochi to serve as a venue for both the Russian Formula One race and World Cup matches during the 2018 tournament, the vast investment can be justified along multiple practical lines, though it ultimately appears an ideologically motivated effort to demonstrate Russia's enduring strength.

The board's findings run counter to President Obama's, who said last week although the program would ""end as it currently exists,"" its capabilities should be maintained.

""The digital world can be an environment rich in humanity."" Francis, 77, has proven to be a divisive figure among some conservative Catholics, who have taken issue with his statements on atheism and homosexuality. In the address published today, he called for Catholics to engage in more inter-religious dialogue, saying that doing so ""does not mean renouncing our own ideas and traditions, but the claim that they alone are valid or absolute."" The pope added that the internet and social media should be used to foster real connections and relationships, calling for greater calm and tenderness. ""The digital world can be an environment rich in humanity,"" Francis wrote.

As an inventor, a coder, and an activist, Swartz had an outsized impact on the world before he died at the age of 26. In his short life, he helped to shape the modern internet by developing RSS, Creative Commons licenses, and Reddit. But he also spent the last two years of his life fighting a legal case that stemmed from his copying millions of documents from a digital library. Depressed and facing 35 years in prison, Swartz committed suicide in his Brooklyn apartment. A compelling new feature documentary Swartz’s story was widely chronicled in real time, including here on The Verge. Now his life and death are being profiled in a compelling new feature-length documentary. The Internet’s Own Boy, directed by Brian Knappenberger (We Are Legion: The Story of the Hacktivists) represents an effort to bring Swartz’s story to a wider audience, one that is less steeped in the fight for unfettered access to information. The film, which premiered this week at the Sundance Film Festival, personalizes the story in part by introducing us to Swartz’s parents and brothers. Like many of us, they are still struggling to understand what happened to Aaron — and whether any positive change can result from the tragedy. A day after the film’s premiere, I met with Swartz’s father, Bob, and his brothers, Noah and Ben. A year later, their grief is still raw: the family dutifully answers my questions, but at times they look as if they would rather be anywhere else. They agreed to participate in the film and to promote it at Sundance to draw attention to Aaron’s case. It is a story that raises questions about the US criminal justice system, prosecutorial discretion, and the threats posed by expanded government monitoring and control over the internet. ""Everyone can do something to help,"" Noah Swartz says, grabbing a seat at the Wasatch Brew Pub in downtown Park City. (No one present is drinking anything stronger than water.) ""People should remember they can go support the EFF, and go look at the things they’re working on and contribute. There’s tons of these organizations, and tons of new ones sprouting up — to help with encryption, tech activism, law reform. People should seek them out."" ""Everyone can do something to help."" While they have come to talk about their brother’s work, Ben and Noah grow most animated while talking about his personality. They still marvel at his workaholism. Ben recalls making lunch plans with Aaron and arriving on time at his apartment only to find his brother alone in his room with the door closed, working on a project. ""He’d say ‘Oh, give me 20 more minutes,’"" Ben says. ""I would sit in the living room and wait for him."" Noah recalls frequently bringing potential projects to Aaron’s attention, only to learn his brother had already investigated them and decided to tackle the same idea from a different approach. ""I could never get him interested in the things I was interested in,"" Noah says, laughing. ""He was always two steps ahead."" On the other hand, his devotion to activism could also isolate him. ""He felt very strongly that he should be productive all the time,"" Noah says. ""I’d say, come hang out. And he’d say ‘Yeah, but I’d rather be writing this email to this senator.’"" Beside us sat Knappenberger, whose previous film profiled the hacktivist collective Anonymous. He is deeply interested in the political dimensions of Swartz’s life, and as a result The Internet’s Own Boy sometimes veers toward agitprop — Knappenberger interviews a host of Swartz’s supporters, and just one person who says the government’s case against him had merit. (The prosecutors declined his interview requests.) It also avoids discussion of Swartz’s history of depression, which others who knew him have said played a role in his suicide. But the movie effectively traces Swartz’s path from programming prodigy to startup wunderkind to outspoken internet activist. Drawing on home movies, photographs, and video clips from his many television appearances, The Internet’s Own Boy captures Swartz’s charisma in a way that his many obituaries have struggled to do. And after he is arrested for downloading articles from the digital archive JSTOR, his treatment at the hands of the government manages to infuriate all over again. It will infuriate you all over again Knappenberger says he wanted to weave together the many threads of Swartz’s life into a portrait that would resonate with a broader audience. ""There was a huge outpouring of anger and frustration when Aaron died,"" he says. ""We all felt it, and we read everything we could read about it. But I felt like it was fractured. It was small glimpses. Unpacking it in a way that tells the whole pictures is something that we really needed."" If he succeeds, he says, he’ll have created ""something that can be accessible to audiences far beyond the internet world."" The film also describes efforts to pass Aaron’s Law, which would reform the 1986 Computer Fraud and Abuse Act under which Swartz was prosecuted. But Congress is slow to act in the best of times, and the Swartz family says that revelations about the National Security Agency by former contractor Edward Snowden have killed any appetite for showing leniency for computer crimes. Still, the Swartzes say they will continue their efforts. ""It looks like there may be some forward progress,"" Bob Swartz says. ""But getting anything but a budget through Congress is hard."" In the meantime, the family continues to find new ways to honor Aaron’s life. Noah is organizing global hackathons to encourage work on projects reflecting his brother’s ideals. And Knappenberger will honor Swartz in a different way — the film will eventually be released under a Creative Commons license. All of which is cold comfort, of course. Aaron Swartz is gone, and the story of his final months still has the power to infuriate a year later. But the internet he helped to shape, and the activism he inspired, is more central to the public consciousness than ever. It is perhaps the only affirming truth in the whole tragedy.",0.7768980082502561,0.22310199174974388,0.850240102036775,1029,5.0272108843537415,554,6.2364620938628157,0,0,"Culture, Entertainment, US & World, Report",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

Spider-Man (or Supaidāman for those of you who love laughing at rōmaji) was a late 1970s series developed by Marvel and Japan's Toei Company. Unlike the American source material, however, it's much, much weirder. The show follows Takuya Yamashiro in the title role, but he's no Peter Parker. Instead of being a nebbishy high school nerd who was bitten by a radioactive spider, he's a motorcyclist who was given his spider powers to help in an intergalactic war against the evil Professor Monster and the Iron Cross Group. And along with his costume, he's given a space ship that can transform into a giant robot called Leopardon, mostly because Toei practically invented Power Rangers-style theatrics and every live-action Toei show needs a robot or twelve. ""I am the Emissary of Hell!"" Marvel is currently streaming episodes one and seven from the series, though it's unclear when the company will release more. The move is fitting since the character just made his canon debut in Amazing Spider-Man #12 during the Spider-Verse event. Hopefully we see more of him.

I tend to have a pretty zen, detached relationship with television: when a show that I like is on, I watch it and appreciate it and think about it. When it's gone, I honor its memory and move on with my life. But the two seasons of Mike White's HBO — comedy? Drama? Weekly meditation on good intentions and human frailty? — were not enough for me. Despite its mundane setting, there was always something universal lurking in its margins. The stakes were much higher than whether Amy Jellicoe would get any Twitter followers, and the show was artful and subtle in the way it let that on. If it had a high concept, it was its profound empathy for its collection of imperfect characters. That thrillingly undefined genre positioning was probably Enlightened's undoing; if you were a fan, you definitely remember the difficulty of summing it up and pushing it on your friends. But in its wake, HBO has taken chances on several similarly nebulous half-hours. Girls debuted in the spring of 2012, placing its bets on the voice of (then little-known) Lena Dunham and the ability of producer Judd Apatow to make it into a Thing. Looking followed in 2014, placing its bets on an audience for a ""gay Girls"" (an unfair reduction of the frequently wonderful series that nonetheless continues to stick). Mumblecore had to be about young people, because who wants to watch anyone over 30 do nothing? Girls and Looking are mumbleshows — the contemporary television iteration of mumblecore, the mid-aughts indie film movement. Mumblecore was defined by its low budgets, unpolished filming style, and naturalistic acting. But it was more than that, otherwise 2004 Sundance Grand Jury Prize winner Primer would be considered one of its greatest successes. Mumblecore had to be about very little. And it had to be about young people, because who wants to watch anyone over 30 do nothing?   Enter Togetherness, a new half-hour from Jay and Mark Duplass. The show follows four adults living under the same roof — a married couple played by Mark Duplass and an excellent Melanie Lynskey, the husband's out-of-work actor best friend (Steve Zissis), and the wife's fading hot-girl sister (Amanda Peet). All of the four leads are circling 40, and dealing with the sort of issues one would expect characters of that age to deal with — marriage troubles, professional crises. Not much happens; a road trip to Sacramento is one of the most dramatic developments in the second half of the season. Mumblecore is all grown up, baby, and it lives in a comfortable craftsman bungalow in Los Feliz! I've spent a good amount of time since watching all eight episodes of its first season wondering what the elevator pitch was that sold this series. ""It's Girls for grown-ups!"" ""It's like Full House if the kids didn't get any lines!"" But perhaps the most accurate and honest would be this: ""Mumblecore is all grown up, baby, and it lives in a comfortable craftsman bungalow in Los Feliz!"" Ten years ago the Duplasses won the SXSW Audience Award for their debut feature The Puffy Chair, and in the interim, not only have the cameras have gotten better and cheaper, but mumblecore itself has become deradicalized. This is in part due to the Duplasses themselves; they were the first of the original mumblecore filmmakers to begin using name talent in their films (2010's Cyrus starred Jonah Hill and Marisa Tomei, 2011's Jeff, Who Lives at Home had Susan Sarandon in a supporting role.) Mark Duplass has also become a familiar face for a certain stripe of comedy fan, between his roles on FX's The League and The Mindy Project.   Mumblecore was toothless by definition; that was part of the charm. The bite came from the idea of a bunch of non-professional kids were asking to be recognized at festivals alongside name talent and much bigger budgets. But when those kids grow up, and there is no longer anything disruptive about them being on the same channel as the Khaleesi, and they're still telling the same kinds of low-stakes stories; it's hard not to question, just like Duplass's Brett at his sound design job, what the whole point is. That's not to say that Togetherness isn't well done and charming in parts, and won't be deeply relatable to a certain kind of middle class Angeleno. But, like Girls, it's largely about people who are scared — of intimacy, of success, of growing old — and while these are legitimate fears to explore dramatically, characters defined by their inaction are hard to maintain much week-to-week interest in. Only Lynskey's character — Michelle, a mild-mannered mom — has a serious adventurous side, which easily makes her the character to root for. The fifth episode revolves around an adult kickball game instigated by Michelle, and her moment of slow-motion victory against a gang of millennials and her own malaise is the emotional high point of the season. Togetherness often feels like a less stylistic American Beauty, which, ouch How can mumblecore age gracefully? Noah Baumbach and Greta Gerwig have been able to pull it off with Greenberg and Frances Ha (I have not yet seen Baumbach's 2014 film While We're Young, but its premise appears to be not too far from Togetherness.) Jill Soloway's Afternoon Delight and now Golden Globe-winning Transparent manage to capture something of the universal in their highly specific characters and stories. Baumbach, Gerwig, and Soloway do more than telegraph events, they put a halo of significance around feelings and experiences one rarely sees on screen, which is clearly what HBO Sunday night seeks to do now as well. All too often, though — and I seriously mean more than twice — Togetherness feels like a less stylistic American Beauty, which, ouch. Its revelations — that marriages can crumble, that there is nothing holding you back from quitting your job and just being a full-time human being — are pretty well-worn territory. And that grown-up mumblecore style does very little to elevate it to something more. My criticism of Togetherness is weirdly the same as my criticism of Gone Girl: it's just a series of events happening to some people. Which is totally fine and a prerequisite for most filmed entertainment, but kind of a dead end.   Critics of the mumblecore movement observed that its radicalness was also its crutch — the absence of an empty high concept often just resulted in an empty low concept. Oftentimes it seemed like a conceptual explanation for the filmmaker either being unable or uninterested in telling stories that weren't largely autobiographical. (By the second episode of the fourth season of Girls, Hannah Horvath runs up against a similar inability and unwillingness, further evidence that she is indeed fated to be the voice of her generation.) Looking is more frequently able to reach beyond itself and the relationship woes of its characters, largely due to its superior acting. Of the three shows in HBO's Sunday night mumblecore block, it's my favorite, but its second season, despite an uptick in on-screen sex, is not without a few navel-gazing lulls. It's great that HBO is greenlighting these smaller, low-stakes shows, even if they didn't find Enlightened to be a worthwhile investment. I'd watch eight more seasons of Togetherness before I watch another episode of the bloated, dourly high-concept The Leftovers. But once we're finished being impressed by how little is happening on the screen, hopefully there's something more for us there to chew on. I'm not asking for much, just a touch of the universal in these increasingly tiny worlds.",0.6451565392148061,0.3548434607851939,0.18301093351093353,1288,4.9371118012422359,682,6.2492668621700878,0,4,"Culture, Entertainment, Review",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

How do you transfer over all the hard work you've put into compiling great mixes for working out, driving, or whatever else? Obviously no one wants to do it manually like some sort of animal, and Tidal seems to understand that. Today, the premium music service owned by Jay Z and his roster of musician pals announced a partnership with Soundiiz. If you're like me, you've probably never heard of Soundiiz before today, and you're equally clueless as to how it's pronounced. I can't help with the latter, but Soundiiz is a website that automatically transfers playlists from one music app to another. After connecting to your Spotify account (that's clearly the competitor Tidal is targeting most with this move), you can simply drag and drop playlists over to Tidal. Soundiiz can also bring over stuff from Soundcloud, Xbox Music, Rdio, and even iTunes playlist files.   And it works, but uh... Let's just say the whole experience feels a bit rough. There are some weird language issues all over the place, likely owing to imperfect machine translations. A healthy dose of banner ads combined with a PayPal donate button almost makes it feel like you're doing something illegal, even when all this thing really does is transfer a list of songs between two services. In fairness, Soundiiz openly says that the whole operation is in beta. And yeah, it definitely feels that way.  Come again? Informartions? But like I said, it pretty much works without issue. Soundiiz successfully transferred 72 of the 75 tracks I've got in my Spotify ""2015"" playlist over to Tidal. Not bad, and I'll chalk the missing tracks up to some small holes in Tidal's catalog. That doesn't mean I'm leaving Spotify anytime soon; I'm firmly in the camp that finds Tidal's design and overall user experience to be pretty subpar by comparison — at least right now. Tidal's CD-quality streaming hasn't swayed me yet, and exclusives do little to help the argument, at least while those same tracks and music videos keep showing up elsewhere before long. We're only at the beginning stages of Tidal as owned by Jay Z, and there's obviously way more to come from this relaunch. Still, I'm a bit surprised that Soundiiz met the company's bar for quality, but maybe signups are going slower than Hov, Daft Punk, Madonna, Rihanna, Alicia Keys, Chris Martin, Jack White, and everyone else had hoped. They're all in this thing together, after all. If you're looking to give Tidal a shot, this should make it pretty painless to get all your stuff copied over.

In a blog post, the company announced the launch of a ""Works with Google Cardboard"" certification program. It aims to guarantee compatibility and the best user experience between the growing number of inexpensive VR headsets (modeled after Google's own) and virtual reality apps in Google Play. ""There’s a tremendous diversity of VR viewers and apps to choose from,"" wrote Andrew Nartker, Cardboard's product manager. ""Each viewer may have slightly different optics and dimensions, and apps actually need this info to deliver a great experience."" So to address this, Google is now offering developers a new tool that will automatically calibrate headsets and apps for the optimal viewing experience. Users will scan a QR code found on any headset with the ""Works with Google Cardboard"" badge, and from there all apps will automatically be adjusted to account for that viewer's specific design. Improved SDK tools for Cardboard are rolling out to developers now, and Google's also releasing a set of design guidelines that it's put together in the months since launching Cardboard last June. These give developers ideas for proper VR menu and interface design, and the guidelines also highlight important steps that can keep users from getting motion sick. The most important guideline in designing for virtual reality is to always maintain head tracking. Never stop tracking the user’s head position inside of the application. Even a short pause in head tracking will cause some users to feel ill. Users will also have an easier time browsing Google Cardboard-compatible apps in Google Play; VR apps are now divided into sections for Music and Video, Games, and Experiences. To round out today's news, Google also revealed that it recently acquired two companies that will help advance its VR efforts. One is Thrive Audio, whose ambisonic surround sound technology will bring truly ""immersive audio to VR,"" according to Google. The other is the team behind Tilt Brush, a 3D painting VR game.

More specifically, Roach has become something of an expert at exploring weird, uncomfortable, sometimes taboo questions — from how quickly a cadaver decays to how paraplegics can achieve orgasm  — and doing it with an unmistakable combination of candor and comedy. Her new book, Gulp, takes readers through the alimentary canal to explore the science of human digestion. Along the way, Roach samples rancid olive oil and whale skin, shoves her hand inside a living cow’s stomach, and follows a human fecal transplant (it’s exactly what it sounds like) from donation to insertion. We caught up with Roach to learn more about the ins and outs of science reporting, the weirdest facts about digestion, and how she decides which far-out topics merit the signature Roach approach. What got you hooked on writing about science, instead of spending your career covering something else? To be honest, it turned out that science stories were always, consistently, the most interesting stories I was assigned to cover. I didn’t plan it like this, and I don’t have a formal background in science, or any education in science journalism. Actually, I have a bachelor’s degree in psychology. But whenever I got a call about doing a science story, I was always drawn to the assignment. I guess for me, it’s sort of like being in continuing education classes all the time. You’re always learning something new, and that’s what I really like about it. You just finished Gulp, a book about digestion. What was the weirdest thing you learned in the reporting process? Keep in mind that I come into these things with no background, so everything I learn is pretty shocking and weird to me. But I was really surprised to find out that we have a second set of nostrils, in the backs of our throats towards our nasal passages. When we chew, some of those [ed: airborne] molecules actually enter this nose and help our brain figure out what we’re eating. I really like wine and gin, so now whenever I drink either one, I try to exhale with my nose when I have some in my mouth. It makes a huge huge difference in what you can taste. What’s the toughest part about science reporting for you? ""I come into a book with the same sense of awe as my readers."" Hands down, the fact that I don’t have a degree in any type of science. I’m always on thin ice with getting stuff straight. Even if I have the basics, or all the little pieces of a story, I’m always at risk of missing some big part or misstating some important detail. When I’m done a book, I always give it to someone with expertise in the topic and tell them to flag all of my stupid mistakes. At the same time, this means I come into a book with the same sense of awe as my readers. I’m discovering all of this stuff with them at the same time, this feeling of ""holy shit, I cannot believe that!"" You certainly seem to pull it off. Which means other writers want to know: how do you work? What’s a day in the work life of Mary Roach? I work out of a little office with 11 other writers and a few people in the radio business. We share office space in downtown Oakland, and that’s where I do my research and my writing if I’m not out on a reporting trip. I have a nice little office, with a nice little window in it, but I do basically spend huge amounts of time in what you could consider solitary confinement. ""I’m basically a professional pesterer."" I usually work Monday to Friday, 9-to-5 banker’s hours, but not because it necessarily has to be that way. I guess that just makes it easier, because those tend to be the hours that the rest of the world is working. I spend a lot of my time on the phone, pestering people. What’s new in your lab? Can I come visit your lab? When can I come visit your lab? I’m basically a professional pesterer. Your books have run the gamut: space, sex, digestion. How do you decide what topic to devote a book project to? It’s largely a process of elimination. A lot of interesting topics out there just won’t work for me. People have suggested that I write books about sleep, or drugs, but those are largely internal — a lot is going on inside someone’s body or inside their head — and I have a hard time making that compelling. I like scenes, events, on-the-ground reporting. ""But there’s no magic potion for coming up with the right idea."" A topic really has to be broad enough so that I can cover a bunch of research and a lot of different angles, but it also has to be appealing to a lot of readers, because publishers like selling books. And let’s face it, so do writers. But there’s no magic potion for coming up with the right idea; you can’t just sit down and decide that you’ll find it in the next two hours. It often just pops up right under my nose, or in the case of Gulp, I guess it popped up inside my nose. If you had to pick, what’s the one scientific breakthrough you most hope to see in your lifetime? I get really excited about specific therapies, personalized therapies. Like, let’s say taking a piece of someone’s tumor and testing a bunch of treatments in a lab and being able to come up with the right therapy for that specific patient. Right now it’s still really expensive and it might still be a ways off, but I think we’re on the verge of a huge breakthrough right now. Who knows how long it’ll be, but that’ll be a big day. And I think that’ll be pretty amazing. Speaking of digestion, let’s say you have to pick your last meal. Right now. What is it? We’ll start with 12 oysters from pretty much anywhere, as long as they’re fresh. Then I’d have to have beef pho, with the raw beef that you put into the soup yourself and let it cook as long as you want it to. And somebody’s gotta do a good job on the broth, because this is my last meal. Then I’d have a few al pastor tacos from the Sinaloa taco truck in Oakland, where I live. And some really good ribs. For dessert, a perfectly fresh mango and some perfectly fresh cherries. But I don’t care so much about dessert; I’d rather save myself for the main courses. Finally, a very, very dry martini, because I need to be a little bit drunk before the executioner pushes the button, or whatever he’s going to do to me.

But a WHO spokesperson told Reuters  that 40 percent of individuals with the flu don't fit that criteria, an alarming situation that heightens potential for a pandemic outbreak. Worse yet, a four-year-old has tested positive for the flu while exhibiting no ill symptoms, a situation that could make tracking H7N9 extremely difficult. Hartl made clear that the WHO has seen no evidence that  ""sustained"" human-to-human transmission is occurring, but he didn't dismiss the possibility. In fact, two suspected cases of inter-human transmission are currently under investigation.

If you look at one effort — a quietly growing national stockpile of vaccines and drug treatments for such horrors as anthrax and avian flu — the answer is yes. But one agency in charge of building that stockpile is also funding the creation of deadlier and more infectious varieties of avian flu, and other animal-borne diseases, which could pose the threat of an outbreak if not handled properly. The paradox has raised alarm bells among some researchers across the country that the government may be undermining its own biodefense strategy.    ""It reflects the clear lack of anyone in charge."" ""It's hard to imagine that someone thought creating new pandemic pathogens would be a good strategy for defending against pandemic pathogens,"" said Richard Ebright, a professor of biochemistry at Rutgers University in New Jersey and director of the Waksman Institute of Microbiology, in an interview with The Verge. ""It reflects the clear lack of anyone in charge"" of US biodefense strategy. The seeming disconnect is highlighted by two major developments in national biosecurity that occurred within the last few months. In late February, the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced that it would restart funding for research projects around the world focused on making new, deadlier, more contagious strains of avian influenza, better known as ""bird flu"" or ""avian flu."" Researchers working in this area argue genetically modifying the virus to make it spread more easily in mammals such as humans is ""essential for pandemic preparedness,"" by revealing in advance how the wild virus could potentially mutate. Currently, avian flu doesn't spread easily among mammals or people, and most fatal cases have occurred directly among those people handling or in close proximity to birds. Some researchers have pointed to the recent outbreak of an avian flu strain in China that's killed over a dozen people as evidence of why their work is necessary. Microscopic image of avian influenza, H5N1 wild type, from Dr. Takeshi Noda, University of Tokyo But researchers around the world working to develop new strains temporarily suspended their work voluntarily last year, and the US government followed in halting funding, after a vocal outcry from other scientists that the published results of such research could be weaponized by terrorists, or that new strains could accidentally infect the public. Despite these concerns, the moratorium on research of more infectious bird flu strains ended in January, with researchers saying the ""the benefits of this work outweigh the risks."" A month later, HHS released a draft version of new funding policies for research, which it said would help minimize the risk to the public, imposing new security criteria on researchers receiving government funds. Still, critics of avian flu research are unswayed. ""Rather than use the avian flu moratorium to seek advice, listen and foster debate, many influenza scientists engaged in an academic exercise of self-justification,"" wrote Simon Wain-Hobson, chairman of the nonprofit Foundation for Vaccine Research, in a recent editorial in the journal Nature. ""[The moratorium] was strictly for public relations,"" Ebright agreed, also telling The Verge, ""No one with a moral compass would propose or perform this work."" ""Many influenza scientists engaged in an academic exercise of self-justification."" Separately and without much fanfare, President Obama in March signed a law giving $2.8 billion in funding to a decade-old biodefense effort called ""Project Bioshield,"" extending it for another five years. Project Bioshield is the umbrella name for a few different programs, and it was initially launched under President George W. Bush in 2004 with $5.6 billion in funding over 10 years, which would have dried up this year had it not been extended. The effort's main goal was to help the US government rapidly build up a national stockpile of drugs collectively known as ""medical countermeasures"" — vaccines, antidotes and other treatments — that could be quickly administered to the public right before or in the event of a bioterror attack. FBI file photo of bagged evidence of a letter containing anthrax sent to then-US Senator Tom Daschle in early October 2001 Coming in the wake of the Sept. 11th, 2001 terror attacks and subsequent, separate anthrax mailing attacks — and following the invasion of Iraq, which was thought to possess chemical or biological weapons — the imperative for Project Bioshield seemed obvious at the time. Just this week, bioterror is back in the headlines again, with reports of a letter mailed to Republican Senator Roger Wicker (R-MS) testing positive for ricin, a type of poison prepared from castor beans.  While bioterror has long faded from the list of concerns for most Americans, Bioshield has quietly spawned into and inspired numerous other biodefense efforts. Researchers and lawmakers maintain that the larger goal of stockpiling against potential health threats such as bioterror, and now, bird flu and other ""emerging diseases,"" is as pertinent as ever. ""This legislation will save lives by improving our ability to quickly respond to a bioterror attack or pandemic outbreak,"" said US Congressman Mike Rogers (R-MI), who introduced the reauthorization bill for parts of Bioshield and its offshoots, in a statement last month. ""Bioshield has had a positive impact."" The way Bioshield has worked so far, the Department of Homeland Security uses intelligence reports to decide which diseases and biological threats are considered ""material,"" or realistic threats to US security. It then refers these findings to Health and Human Services (HHS), which determines whether it's necessary for the government to order new drugs from pharmaceutical companies to combat the threats. In order to spur pharmaceutical companies to develop these drugs fast enough, a funding agency within HHS called the  Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) hands out lucrative contracts, parts of which can be paid up front. It also offers avenues to speed up the drug approval process, and guarantees certain purchase amounts. By most accounts, this process has been successful, with BARDA securing 17 different medical countermeasures worth over $2 billion collectively, including drugs used to prevent and treat such threats as anthrax, smallpox and, lately, avian flu. ""The benefits have extended beyond what the drafters may have originally intended,"" wrote Robert Kadlec, who helped lead biodefense efforts under both presidents W. Bush and Obama, in a recently published review of Project Bioshield. ""Bioshield has had a positive impact,"" Ebright also said to The Verge. Microscopic view of anthrax bacteria bacillus anthracis from Kenyon College's MicrobeWiki But for its successes, there were also some early failures, and gaps that remain to this day. The first Bioshield contract issued in 2004 was terminated after the pharmaceutical company that received the award failed to produce 25 million doses of anthrax vaccine in two years per HHS's deadline, which ""would have been unrealistic even for a larger manufacturer,"" as a report from the Government Accountability Office (GAO) found. The report concluded HHS should never have awarded the contract in the first place, and that ""the lack of clear requirements is a cause of concern to companies asked to partner with the government."" Another major issue uncovered in subsequent Congressional research reports is the expiration of the drugs in the stockpile. Like most drugs, they too have expiration dates, but it's still unclear if and how BARDA should be dipping into Project Bioshield funding to replenish the stockpile when drugs go bad, and if it should turn to the same companies that made the drug in the first place. That issue ""certainly hasn't been publicly addressed,"" as Ebright noted. ""the lack of clear requirements is a cause of concern."" Then there's the issue of the money leftover from the original Project Bioshield fund: nearly a third of the original $5.8 billion has yet to be spent. ""If Congress had not made rescissions and transfers to other accounts,"" HHS would not have been able to spend all the money it has so far, one report found.  ""Project Bioshield is the remarkable case of a federal agency that has actually grossly underspent its budget,"" said Ebright, ""Primarily because of bureaucratic mismanagement."" But perhaps most disconcerting of all is the fact that the very same parent agency in charge of funding drugs for the national stockpile, HHS, is also the one that is separately funding research into new diseases that could result in a bioterror or accidental infection, which would in turn demand a response from the national stockpile. ""The activities of Project Bioshield are directly undermined by HHS funding the development of potential bioweapons agents,"" Ebright said. ""These are clear cross purposes. Would any sane government do that? Absolutely not."" All reported cases of avian influenza in humans for the year 2013 as of March 12, compiled by the World Health Organization ""I think we made our own situation worse."" In other disconcerting news, a report issued by the Government Accountability Office in February found that there is no good estimate of how many labs around the US are able to carry out the work of engineering deadly new pathogens (labs rated the highest biosafety levels, or BSL-3 and BSL-4), and there's no federal accountability for what security procedures they are following.  ""I think we made our own situation worse by building a lot of BSL-3 and 4 labs with very little supervision,"" said Laura Kahn, a Princeton staff researcher specializing in biodefense and pandemics. As Kahn pointed out, the leading suspect of the still-unresolved 2001 anthrax attacks was himself a former Army microbiologist with access to these types of labs. Incredibly, if any of the HHS-funded research to create new, more dangerous pathogens is ""successful,"" it may lead to the results being categorized as threats by Homeland Security, and then, in turn, to BARDA spending money on drugs to protect against the results its parent organization just helped fund. Ebright pointed to the resumption of avian flu research, and other recent HHS-funded research on a variant of SARS, as just some examples of the kind of threats that could potentially result in this kind of boomerang effect — although none so far have. Asked about this concern, HHS said the two efforts — disease research and drug stockpiling — would not be impacted by each other. ""The type of research BARDA supports would not be affected by the resumption of [avian flu] studies,"" said  Robin Robinson, Ph.D., director of BARDA, in an email to The Verge. ""There are no overlaps between these activities and BARDA’s medical countermeasure development programs under Project Bioshield and Pandemic Influenza Preparedness and Response."" Image credit: CDC Whatever one makes of the current state of US biodefenses, it's fairly clear from all the available oversight documents — including those released by HHS itself — that the system could be far more efficient, well-organized and arguably safer. Kahn and Ebright lament the fact that there are few independent organizations reviewing the government's work in this persistently important arena, leaving it up to the government check itself. Ebright, for his part, thinks that the US would do well to appoint a ""central biopreparedness czar,"" to coordinate these disparate efforts and make sure they aren't canceling each other out. BARDA, for its part, has attempted to solve one of its own issues — that only small companies have tried to fill the contracts for the drug stockpile —  by creating new public-private partnership incubators designed to ramp up even more drug production in the next five years. ""I had hoped there would be a major change with the replacement of the Bush Administration."" ""I had hoped there would be a major change with the replacement of the Bush Administration,"" Ebright said to The Verge. ""The Obama campaign said all the right things about science-based policy. It's dismaying to see that they kept the same dysfunctional structures and programs in place for biopreparedness."" Ultimately, the researchers sounding the alarm just hope that policy change rolls around by 2016, or sooner — before a threat emerges that we are unprepared to deal with. ""The other way that there would be a change is the one you hope never happens,"" Ebright said.",0.5043979967526133,0.4956020032473867,0.8484369363832998,2045,5.2542787286063568,913,6.7962760131434834,0,0,"Policy & Law, Science, Report",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Recent reports indicate that other letters mailed to other government officials, including President Obama himself, may have tested positive for ricin as well.  ""You can make it in your kitchen from a plant you grow in your garden."" People can be exposed to ricin through a variety of ways: inhaling the powder, ingesting powder or castor beans, or having it injected straight into the bloodstream. Absorption through the skin is rare. The symptoms and health effects vary depending on the route ricin was administered, including everything from coughing, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, accumulation of fluid in the brain, low blood pressure, and potentially, death. No injuries have been reported yet due to the letters reported this week, but the close timing of both the bombings and the ricin mailings to one another this week recalled the tense months after the September 11th, 2001 terror attacks, when letters containing anthrax, a separate bioterror agent, were mailed to several Congressmen and national media figures. But anthrax is much harder to make into a biological weapon, requiring a specific knowledge of biology and medicine. ""The reason we keep seeing ricin used in bioterror is that you can make it in your kitchen from a plant you grow in your garden,""  Dr. Eric Toner, a senior research associate at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center's (UMPC) Center for Biosecurity. ""Most ricin used in bioterror and biocrimes has not been effective."" Indeed, ricin has a much lengthier public history as a bioweapon, going back the 1978 murder of Bulgarian journalist Georgi Markov, who was killed after having a pellet thought to contain ricin injected into his leg. Since then, there have been dozens of incidents of attempted ricin poisonings against various victims, but few recorded fatalities, or even illnesses. That's because although ricin is lethal in its most potent forms, very few amateurs are able to extract and concentrate it to the point that it could cause death, or even severe illness. ""Most ricin used in bioterror and biocrimes has not been effective,"" Toner said. Although we still don't know all the details about the ricin mailing incidents this week, Toner cautions against overhyping the threat. ""The fact that they [authorities] have been able to detect ricin does not mean there was a toxic amount present,"" Toner told The Verge. ""The stuff you make in your kitchen is not very potent or pure."" So despite the fact the instructions for making ricin are readily available to amateurs on the internet, and the poison has been featured as a recurring weapon in the hit drama Breaking Bad, making the poison itself in any significant dose to seriously harm or kill someone would require a chemistry lab, Toner said. ""The stuff you make in your kitchen is not very potent or pure,"" he explained. That goes doubly true for ricin being used as a type of letter attack: even as a powder, the individual ricin particles don't stay suspended in the air nearly as long as anthrax spores. ""The notion that someone would get a toxic dose of ricin through a letter that they opened, via inhalation or absorption, is doubtful,"" Toner asserted. ""Ricin isn't in the same category as other biological agents. We're much more concerned about anthrax, smallpox and ebola."" That's a good thing, all the more so because as of now, there is no US-government approved antidote for ricin, nor vaccine, although a vaccine is in development. Toner cautions against findings by other researchers that natural properties of milk and black tea may be effective defenses. ""I'm sure none of that is based on strong science,"" he said. Instead, treatment for ricin poisonings includes general ""supportive therapy"" such as intravenous fluids and medicines to maintain blood pressure. ""The intent may simply be to cause havoc."" Without further details on who is behind the latest ricin attacks, and the precise method that was used to extract the ricin, it's tough to evaluate the physiological danger they may have posed. But the psychological effects of the attacks on society are fairly clear: panic and terror. ""Because ricin is very unlikely to kill anybody, that may not be the intent,"" Toner said. ""The intent may simply be to cause havoc. People know they can do this and it will set off all sorts of alarms in the media, like we are seeing today.""",0.38248073323329507,0.6175192667667049,0.4413182111888901,801,5.0262172284644198,415,6.2939759036144576,0,0,"Science, Report",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Previously, scientists used the Atacama Pathfinder Experiment (APEX) telescope, which produced the best map to date but didn't provide enough resolution for researchers to be sure how many galaxies were depicted in the imagery. The team says that their results ""form the first statistically reliable catalogue of dusty star-forming galaxies in the early universe.""  ALMA's sharper results go beyond offering a prettier picture — they actually change our understanding of star formation. The team discovered that up to half of the time what APEX had rendered as a single blob represented multiple galaxies. ""We previously thought the brightest of these galaxies were forming stars a thousand times more vigorously than our own galaxy, the Milky Way, putting them at risk of blowing themselves apart,"" said team member Alexander Karim of Durham University. ""The ALMA images revealed multiple, smaller galaxies forming stars at somewhat more reasonable rates.""  Previous map blurred multiple galaxies into one blob ALMA was finally completed with all 66 individual antennas last month, but this study was only conducted with less than a quarter of these. Even so, the array performed admirably — it was able to pinpoint each galaxy to a tiny area 200 times smaller than the region captured by APEX, and three times as sensitive. ALMA's speed and sensitivity allowed it to double the total number of observations that had ever been made in the space of a few hours. In the image below, the small red marks denote galaxies captured by ALMA, and the red circles are regions where APEX had detected the presence of galaxies.  Telescopes that observe light at longer wavelengths like ALMA and APEX are necessary to study the formation of the universe because much of it took place in distant areas obscured by space dust. While APEX uses one large dish-shaped antenna, ALMA works by spreading several similar antennas across a wider distance.

In his post to readers on the eve of 2013, Josh Topolsky offered up that promise. And he kept it. Four months later, I'm excited to welcome all of you to The Verge Science — a dedicated section of The Verge that'll explore scientific inquiry with the same enthusiasm, intellect, and curiosity that our site already brings to coverage of technology and culture.  It's my job to get you really damn excited about science If you're an avid reader of The Verge, I'm willing to bet that you get really excited about tech. It's my job, as the fearless leader of this new hub, to get you really damn excited about science, too. To do that, I had to step back and figure out why I was excited about science in the first place. I've worked as a science reporter since I was 18, and I've covered the topic for a ton of different audiences — from national defense nerds to uber-science fanatics to women ages 35 to 60 to the ""average American reader"" on AOL. But no matter who I was writing for, or what topics I was covering, science always seemed like the only game in town.   When I was 11 or so, my parents both got sick. Their illnesses weren't similar at all: one manifested itself in the body, in the ability to see, to walk, to speak; the other showed up less tangibly, in the capacity to enjoy experiences, treasure relationships, and perceive the positive. Yet they were both rooted in the same inscrutable place: the brain. It's a connection that both fascinated and frustrated me for years, as I struggled to understand how we could know so little about diseases that affected so much. Meanwhile, I watched my parents experience markedly different outcomes following their diagnoses. Thanks to a pioneering treatment for MS, my dad has never been healthier. My mom, in part because of a lack of adequate remedies for clinical depression, died eight years ago. Learning to understand these experiences opened my eyes to science Learning to understand these experiences opened my eyes to science. I realized that when the people closest to me were sick, struggling, even dying, the possibilities of science became my only recourse. I could be frustrated by what we didn't know, or I could be heartened by what we might one day find out. Knowing that people were working on solutions was comforting in a way that nothing else could be. Scientific research might not figure out the answers I wanted quickly enough, but someday, it would have them. When things get really bad, someday is a pretty important word. No question is impossible to answer Of course, science is about much more than health and medicine, and it doesn't always touch us so personally. But the possibilities inherent to scientific investigation are universal, whether it's space or electronics or climate change — and often those possibilities are going to impact our lives. In science, no question is impossible to answer, though it might take thousands of tries and several lifetimes to find the right solution. That makes me hopeful, and curious, and excited. It also makes me intent on staying informed. I want to know how what's going on now might one day influence my health or the environment, or how it might transform the devices we use or even the way we understand the universe.

With very few exceptions, though, these all have one limiting factor in common: you're relying on someone else's software to interpret data and relay it to you. What if you could program your own notifications from objects or conditions in your physical environment, set to tell you anything you want to know, when you need to know it? That’s the proposition offered by Supermechanical's Twine, a small turquoise box crammed with sensors. Launched on Kickstarter last year, it takes standard accelerometers, thermometers, and other sensors, and fits them into an ambitious package that promises to be a lot easier to set up than your average Arduino-powered DIY assembly. How does Twine work? Does it even work at all? Will it change your life? Let's find out. Twine makes a great impression out of the box. Its brown cardboard packaging befits the product's humble Kickstarter origins, but it's emblazoned with an attractive design on the outside and thoughtful compartmentalization when opened. Each sensor has its own labeled section, making it easy to tell which spartan part is which, and Twine itself rests in a tray on top of the whole package with its battery section exposed. That's another nice consideration, since it's actually pretty hard to open the device up again — the main Twine unit is a white plastic box encased in a teal silicone sleeve that has an incredibly snug fit. Once your batteries are in and the sleeve is on, though, you're left with a simple palm-sized square about 2.8 inches on each side. A Micro USB port and a 3.5mm headphone jack let you hook up external sensors with a male-to-male cable, and your sole hardware output comes via a blueish white LED that glows when Twine is responding to something. The most distinctive part of Twine's design is the corrugated pattern that breaks away at one end, recalling a ball of wool. It's not just for show, either; the wayward ""string"" leads to a hole in the top left corner, which goes through the whole box and makes it easier to attach or fit Twine to otherwise awkward places. The standard Twine unit comes with three functioning sensors that detect orientation, temperature, and — enabled via a recent software update — vibration. The basic package knows which direction it's facing, can tell you the temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit, and tracks whether and how intensely it's in motion. For anything more than that, though, you'll need to connect some external sensors, which you can order in various configurations from Supermechanical. The company also recently launched an accessory called the Cloud Shield, which attaches to an Arduino board and sends information straight to Twine. My Twine shipped with three sensors: a moisture detector, a magnetic switch (plus an adhesive magnet), and a breakout board that dramatically expands your options for connectivity. With the board, you'll be able to connect photoresistors and other components that Supermechanical doesn't sell itself. All of these attach via an included 3.5mm male-to-male cable, and Twine detects them automatically. In appearance, though, the sensors are everything Twine isn't; the exposed circuitry jars a little with the sleek and friendly package offered by the main box. The moisture sensor in particular was a little alarming when I first started using it — is it really okay to put something like this outside in the rain, exposing its elements to the elements? The answer, so far at least, appears to be yes, but I have to admit to a degree of trepidation in my first days with Twine. Since then, however, Supermechanical has updated its website and blog with more useful information on how the sensors are supposed to work, which should give owners a bit more peace of mind. Since Twine itself is pretty much a featureless box, all your interaction with it is handled through a well-designed web app. Changes in the environment are accurately reported online; Twine usually updates its status every 45 seconds or so, but you can force more frequent reports at the expense of battery life by placing it face-down. Twine uses two included AAAs for power, and while Supermechanical officially claims they should last around 30-40 days under normal conditions, I didn't find performance to be nearly that good. My unit tended to send me a message warning of low energy after just over a week, which isn't great, although Supermechanical has acknowledged the issue and pledged to fix it in an forthcoming update. In any case, you'll probably want to invest in a decent set of rechargeables or use the Micro USB port instead. Twine's hardware works well and is wrapped in a convenient package, to be sure, but it's nothing many DIY enthusiasts couldn't string together themselves. Where it takes a leap into a new realm of accessibility, however, is in the setup and software. The first thing you do with Twine is read the message embossed on the back of the device, which tells you to go to twinesetup.com, and in a couple of minutes you should be hooked up to your home Wi-Fi network. Once that's done, you use a simple web-based interface to set up rules and conditions for Twine to respond to. This really couldn't be much easier to use: a box on the left tells you what state your Twine is currently in, and you can create new rules by selecting from just a couple of options. For example, it's easy to set Twine to let you know when the temperature drops below a certain level, or if the moisture sensor gets wet, or if the magnet switch is tripped. The website has been updated significantly since I first received my Twine, and now features a semi-responsive design that scales down well to Android, iOS, and Windows Phone 8 devices — though I couldn't get it to load on Windows Phone 7. So, Twine works well enough in theory, but how about in practice? I've tried as best I can to slot the little box into my life and find potential uses for it, and in my personal situation the results have been mixed. For example, I thought the moisture sensor might work well as a way to let me know when the weather took a turn for the worse so I could bring my laundry in. It does indeed do this, but I found I needed to place the sensor in a glass that would collect enough water in order to trip both prongs, by which point I'd probably have noticed the weather by looking outside the window — or my clothes would be too damp for it to matter. I could see the moisture sensor working effectively in more drastic scenarios, however, such as keeping track of a basement prone to flooding. I also tried using the vibration sensor to let me know when my washing machine's cycle was done (Supermechanical has posted a handy guide for this), and while it did work well enough, in my miniature Tokyo apartment it's not like I'd ever miss the beep that the washer makes itself. I also found that keeping this parameter set would often result in Twine sending me messages that it was no longer moving, even if it had simply been lying on my table for hours; perhaps I'd need to tweak the sensitivity settings further, or perhaps it's the sort of thing best turned off when not in use. My greatest success came with using the orientation sensor. Twine reacts really quickly and accurately to let you know which way it's facing, and I put this to use in my mailbox (physical, not electronic). By placing it within a couple of inches of the letter flap, I was able to make it send me a message whenever the mailman inadvertently knocked it over with his delivery. Granted, this often gave me false alarms whenever I got junk mail from Domino's, meaning I'd have to go downstairs to both put Twine back upright and dispose of a pizza menu, but it still gave good results for the most part. The temperature sensing also worked well for me. In Tokyo's volatile weather, I often find myself leaving the heater or cooler on longer than I probably should; by setting high or low thresholds for your room's temperature, Twine can let you know that it's probably time to adjust your thermostat. As with the other sensors, I found temperature readouts to be responsive and accurate. Obviously, Twine’s potential is pretty intimately tied to your living situation. I work at home most days in a fairly small apartment, so a single box that can tell me a single thing that’s going on within my general location isn’t hugely useful to me. If I had a larger living space, a commute, and more Twines, however, the story might be quite different. I can imagine elaborate schemes where multiple Twines work in tandem to notify workers of various things going on in their houses while they’re at the office, or vice versa. When its environment changes and its sensors are triggered, Twine can contact you in a variety of ways. The easiest is email — it works with any address, and you can set the subject line and body of each message. I found that these almost always arrived within a couple of seconds of tripping Twine's sensors, and if you send them to an account that gives you push notifications on your phone, it's probably the best option. You can also set Twine to send SMS messages or voice alerts to your phone number, though you'll need a paid subscription. I also had trouble getting them to work on Japanese carriers at first, but the system was reworked with the introduction of subscriptions and voice alerts, and now works perfectly. In any case, I found the email alerts to be a better option; you're less limited in formatting, and the messages are free. Supermechanical rolled out a further update that added Twitter support during the review period, and while I'm still waiting for it to talk to my Pebble smartwatch directly, it's a bit of a moot point — the Pebble can already receive emails, tweets, and texts that Twine sends to smartphones. Another somewhat unorthodox future notification method is the Spark Socket, which will let you control your home light bulbs based on feedback from Twine. I haven't seen exactly how this will work yet, but presumably it'll be based on the same simple system of rules that powers the more conventional sensors. If Twine as a product picked up steam, I could see it becoming a solid platform for this kind of thing; its software is basic, but useful enough to be easily applicable to a variety of devices and situations. There's a whole ecosystem of outlandish hardware products that connect to the iPhone — I'd like to see more using Twine as a bridge to the home.",0.5181863201653344,0.4818136798346656,0.1872945418815446,1863,4.7530864197530862,839,6.2622169249106081,0,0,,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

A research team at Brigham and Women's Hospital applied similar thinking to a new adhesive patch that latches onto human tissue by way of dozens of microneedles. The resulting bond is over three times as strong as staples conventionally used in skin graft procedures according to Dr. Seung Yun Yang. Lead researcher Jeffrey Karp explains the adhesion process further, saying ""the unique design allows the needles to stick to soft tissues with minimal damage to the tissues. Moreover, when it comes time to remove the adhesive, compared to staples, there is less trauma inflicted to the tissue, blood and nerves, as well as a reduced risk of infection.""  Infection is another potential danger of the staples and stutures that commonly go hand-in-hand with skin grafts.

These requests are split between court orders, warrants, and emergency requests, each of which dictates how much personal information Verizon will release. What the report can't include is information on most national security orders issued by the NSA or other intelligence agencies — including the one that compels Verizon to turn over all phone records for storage in a government database. By far the most common category is subpoenas, which can provide police or federal agents with metadata and customer information; Verizon says that more than half of that number request only the name and address behind an IP address or phone number. Of the roughly 70,600 additional court orders received during the same period, Verizon says 63,000 asked for the same information as subpoenas, while 6,300 requested traces on phone lines and 1,500 involved actually tapping phones. A further 36,000 warrants were issued, which Verizon says asked for location information and content that customers stored through the company's email or phone services. Verizon received between 1,000 and 2,000 national security letters Verizon disclosed these requests after coming under scrutiny for releasing information to the NSA, but the most it releases about the far less transparent US anti-terrorism and anti-espionage orders is the number of national security letters it receives. These controversial orders, usually issued by the FBI and staunchly defended by the White House, can only be described in ranges of a thousand, so we've now learned that Verizon received somewhere between 1,000 and 2,000 requests in 2013, as well as what it will disclose after receiving them: name, address, length of service and toll billing records. As part of Obama's promised policy reforms, companies are supposed to be able to give more information about these orders except if it would seriously hurt an investigation, but there's no telling when that will happen. Likewise, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper has said that companies and the intelligence community will eventually be able to give estimates of more national security requests.

In a ruling on Tuesday, Koh ruled that Samsung was infringing on one patent, and she invalidated one of the patents it was preparing to bring against Apple in court. Specifically, the keyboard found on the Galaxy Nexus, Galaxy Note, and several other older devices officially violates an Apple autocorrect patent, which covers Android's system of displaying both what the user is typing and what the system thinks they meant to type. Samsung argued that Apple's patent could only refer to a hardware keyboard, not the ""soft"" one used on both iOS and Android. But this claim didn't hold water, and Koh found the infringement so clear that she granted Apple summary judgment, which means Samsung will need to prove the patent is invalid in order to win. If Apple comes out victorious, this isn't just a problem for Samsung: Google will have to work around the judgment in order to make sure Android as a whole isn't left open to lawsuits. Apple's patent covered the Android autocorrect system Apple didn't do as well in its claims for summary judgment on other patents. Koh declined to judge a claim that Samsung's system for recognizing things like phone numbers or email addresses in text violated an existing patent. Samsung, however, also failed to get an assurance that Android's Jelly Bean iteration didn't violate that patent. The same thing happened with a patent for synchronizing information between devices and one for universal search, a feature that's come up in other Apple patent suits: there was enough potential ambiguity that neither side won a decisive victory. One of Samsung's patents, however, was declared invalid, leaving it with only four claims to bring to court. Koh agreed with Apple's argument that the patent, which covered syncing media between devices, depended too heavily on previous work, with few meaningful updates. This puts Samsung at a disadvantage if the case goes to trial, but it also gives it less bargaining power when the two meet for a mediation session in February. Either way, the chances of an agreement seem unlikely, and both parties are likely to go before a jury in March.",0.30858260183256325,0.6914173981674367,0.8646416797002955,371,4.9622641509433958,223,5.7488789237668163,0,0,"Policy & Law, US & World",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

The technology was made by Recon Instruments, a Canadian company started in 2008 as a business school project at the University of British Columbia. The software was a bit sluggish, and the battery only lasted about half a day on the mountain, but otherwise the experience was amazing. Seeing my speed and altitude in real time was thrilling, and the live trail maps completely enhanced my time on the mountain. It was a transhuman kind of experience.  The Recon Jet is the next evolution of that experience, and it's much more accessible. It takes that same idea of a heads-up display and moves it to a more portable pair of sports-style sunglasses. Instead of requiring a lift ticket to enjoy it, the Jet works just as well on a bike ride as it does when you're jogging around the block.  The company gave me a short demo in our office last month, and it works much better than the winter sports version. That's because the software it runs has been totally revamped, and also because Recon has been working on the Jet for years — the first time we tried a prototype was when it debuted at Google's I/O developer conference in 2013. All the information sits just below your right eye in a spot that's surprisingly easy to glance at. The screen quality is vastly improved from past versions, too, and you have more control over the positioning of it than before. Recon doesn't expect you to wear it all day, however. The display wont last all day, but you can detach it or swap batteries  ""We think the proper way to think about smart eyewear is in an activity-specific way,"" Tom Fowler, Recon's chief marketing officer, tells me. So the team made the Jet with modular hardware. The battery — which lasts about four hours and can be swapped — is housed in a unit on one side of the glasses, and the display, touchpad, and all the internals are in a unit on the other. Each are easy to clip off, which leaves you with a big and sporty pair of sunglasses. Even the lenses and frames separate, and Recon sells alternate versions of each piece. The whole package weighs 85 grams — noticeably heavier than normal sunglasses, but the Jet still feels light. I wasn't worried about the glasses falling off, either, though it's not like I was working up a sweat.  Recon Jet's heads-up display PreviousNextView full GalleryPreviousNext The $699 price tag isn't cheap, but frankly that's the Jet's biggest drawback. For competitive or even casual athletes, it's a much better price point than Google Glass, and a more attractive option overall. Inside there's a 1GHz dual-core processor, 1GB of RAM, and 8GB of storage. It pairs to your phone via Bluetooth for access to social media notifications and messages, accepting and rejecting calls, and controlling music. You don't need your phone, though. The Jet shoots video and photos, uses maps and navigation, tracks your speed and altitude, and more, all while unpaired. Interaction with the software is performed with an optical touchpad, which in the demo worked much better than the touchpad found on Google Glass. You can swipe up, down, left, and right — but you also use rocker buttons underneath the right module to move through menus, instead of tapping the touchpad like with Glass. It's a much better experience: it's harder for accidental clicks to register, and you won't knock the glasses off balance as easily. The Recon Jet is not for everyone. Future versions could certainly be sleeker, and other companies are trying to find ways to put screens in front of our faces. (Sony's working on one, and Google's not done trying.) But plenty of people have been waiting for a device like the Jet, and for them, that wait is over.",0.6170232705831717,0.38297672941682825,0.19590192540559903,681,4.6828193832599121,385,5.8311688311688314,0,45,"Tech, Hands-on, Photo Essay",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The update doesn't, however, include the mail or notes apps promised by Any.do nearly two years ago.  In addition to the new grid view, Any.do version 3.0 also makes collaboration a bit simpler. Sharing lists with multiple users was added in the app's last major update, but it's now easier to add people and see who's involved, with little portraits for each collaborator displayed at the top of the project. Lists can also now be sorted by time or priority, with Any.do remembering preferences for different lists. (You might want to sort your work list by deadline, for example, but keep your home list sorted by priority.)

""It's the first one ever that's been implanted into an animal,"" said Harald Ott, MD and PhD at the Massachusetts General Hospital Center for Regenerative Medicine and the lead researcher behind the project, to The Verge.     ""The first one ever that's been implanted into an animal."" Specifically, Ott and his team managed to grow whole new kidneys in several days outside of the animals' bodies in ""bioreactors,"" chambers full of oxygen and nutrients, and then implant them into several rat test animals that were suffering from kidney failure. These bioengineered kidneys were able to link up to the rats' circulatory system without rejection, produced urine just like real kidneys, and prolonged the rat subjects' lives. ""Based on this inital proof of principle, we hope that bioengineered kidneys will someday be able to fully replace kidney function just as donor kidneys do,"" Ott said in a statement.    A kidney scaffold was re-seeded with newborn rat cells To be clear, Ott and his team still relied on donor organs for their work, but not in the way you might think. The researchers took several nonfunctioning kidneys from other, dead rats and stripped them of most of their tissue and cells using a soapy, liquid detergent solution. What was left behind was a scaffold made up of collagen — essentially the 3D-outline of a kidney — which the researchers then took and re-""seeded"" with kidney cells from newborn rats and blood cells from humans. Previous research by other teams has also produced kidney scaffolds, but not gone the extra mile of re-seeding them and implanting them successfully into living animals. To re-attach the cells to the empty kidney scaffold in this case, the researchers used a pressurized solution. Finally, when all was said and done, they were able to watch the kidneys regrow into new, functional kidneys that secreted urine.  Rat kidney scaffold, stripped of cells, from Massachusetts General Hospital.   The next step is to repeat the experiment with larger animals and using the cells of the actual implant recipient, eventually working the way up to human beings needing organ transplants. Ott and his colleagues have already managed to strip the cells of larger animals — pigs and human kidneys — using the same technique. ""In an ideal world, such grafts could be produced 'on demand' from a patient's own cells, helping us overcome both the organ shortage and the need for chronic immunosuppression,"" Ott said in a statement. ""We're now investigating methods of deriving the necessary cell types from patient-derived cells and refining the cell-seeding and organ culture methods to handle human-sized organs."" The goal is to be able to help reduce the shortfall of donor organs for the over 75,000 Americans with kidney failure still awaiting transplant. ""We're now investigating methods [...] to handle human-sized organs."" So far, the researchers have already learned a number of important procedures from their experiments on rats. One of those was just how much pressure to apply to re-seed the kidneys with new cells. Ott said that his team came to this via trial and error. ""We had quite a few kidneys blow up in a jar,"" he explained in a Nature video on the research. The full results of the work, including the successfully-grown kidneys, are described in depth in a paper published in the journal Nature Medicine this week.

Each nanosponge is a tiny polymer-based particle measuring 85nm (around one 300,000th of an inch) across that's been wrapped in a red blood cell membrane. When scientists injected the material into mice, toxic proteins attached themselves to the nanosponges and were harmlessly transported to the liver for removal. The nanosponges were developed at the University of California, San Diego by a team led by Professor Liangfang Zhang. A clinical trial on mice tested their efficacy against a lethal dose of a bacterial toxin from Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and found that it greatly increased the rodents' chance of survival. When dosed with the nanosponges before being injected with the toxin, 89 percent of the mice survived. When treated after being infected, 44 percent of the mice lived. When dosed at exactly the same time, the mice suffered no adverse effects, even with a 70-to-one ratio of toxin and nanosponges. Tests in 2011 showed that the sponges could stay inside the bodies of mice for almost three days.    Further tests are needed but the future looks bright for nanosponges The results of the clinical trial are certainly encouraging, but further tests are needed to gauge the nanosponges' ability to save human lives. Professor Jean-Christophe Leroux of the Institute of Pharmaceutical Studies at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology tells Discovery News that it's not clear if the approach will work with humans, and also notes that infections would have to be treated very early as damage can occur quite quickly. The nanosponges will also only be effective against certain types of infections — toxins that attack the nervous system, for example, would be unaffected. Even so, Professor Zhang hopes to move to human trials soon. The path to seeing their research approved for real-world use could be smoother for Zhang's team than most. The polymer used for the nanosponges has already been approved by the FDA, and the red blood cell membrane is taken from the body, meaning there are no new chemical compounds to approve.",0.5881342787660194,0.4118657212339806,0.8674390932322349,354,5.2457627118644066,219,6.1141552511415522,0,0,Science,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

In a press release published Thursday, NASA credited a group of amateur Russian space enthusiasts with discovering what could be remnants of the Mars 3 — a Soviet craft that successfully landed on Mars in 1971, before suddenly losing contact with the USSR seconds afterward.    The discovery was made by a Russian online community dedicated to the Mars Rover Curiosity. Community leader Vitali Egorov led an effort to discover the Mars 3 using the imagery gathered by NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, and a model of what the Mars 3's hardware might look like under the orbiter's High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) camera. A match was ultimately found in a five-year-old image that may contain evidence of the Mars 3's parachute, heat shield, terminal retrorocket and lander. Experts say the items in the images bear remarkable similarities with the Mars 3's hardware, though further tests are needed.   ""I wanted to attract people's attention to the fact that Mars exploration today is available to practically anyone."" ""Together, this set of features and their layout on the ground provide a remarkable match to what is expected from the Mars 3 landing, but alternative explanations for the features cannot be ruled out,"" HiRISE Principal Investigator Alfred McEwen of the University of Arizona, Tucson, said in a statement.

For Egorov, the finding is a testament to the power of crowdsourced space exploration.

In front of a meeting room packed full with journalists and citizens, the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency (SFMTA) just approved a proposal that will see commuter shuttle buses pay to share approximately 200 spots with city buses. Companies that operate the buses will soon have to pay $1 for every stop they make, every day, to the SFMTA — amounting to about $1.5 million over the 18-month pilot (set to start in July 2014). The agency won't earn any profit from the money it collects, though; instead, it'll use the fees to cover the new permit program, enforcement, and further evaluation of the pilot. Prior to today, Silicon Valley shuttles typically would use SFMTA bus stops throughout the city without express permission, leading to potential traffic snarls — as well as a sentiment that these companies were taking advantage of the city without giving anything back. ""We need to be able to keep [the shuttles] honest."" Carli Paine, a project manager for the pilot, gave a number of details on what the SFMTA hopes to accomplish in her opening remarks. ""The commuter shuttle sector has grown very rapidly, and its created some impacts on Muni (San Francisco public transportation). Our approach has been to resolve the problems in an ad hoc way,"" she said, ""but the sector is so large now that that's not really a sustainable approach."" Aside from collecting money from commuter shuttles, those shuttles will now be equipped with GPS so their impact on traffic and the buses that typically use the Muni stops can be better measured. ""We need to be able to keep them honest, and this data will allow us to do that,"" said Payne. Vehicles will also have to be clearly identified with a new permit that will allow them to use the Muni stops — those without the proper permits will be ticketed, just like normal vehicles. As for when this program will get underway, the SFMTA will spend the next few months doing more research, getting data from Muni stops and shuttle services to find out which stops make the most sense to roll this program out to. In case you're living under a rock... BREAKING protesters stop 2 tech buses just before SFMTA vote on bus fees pic.twitter.com/cHFeTI6ljP Whether that'll be enough to quell the sometimes-violent protests against tech shuttles remains to be seen — just hours before today's vote, protesters in San Francisco again blocked two buses from Apple and Google. Things didn't get violent this time, but it seems likely that tensions between the bus-users and other San Francisco citizens could remain high. This tension was acknowledged right at the top of today's meeting — While the Silicon Valley companies will now be giving back to the city more than they have in the past, a formalized shuttle system won't fully address concerns that the tech industry is causing class warfare in San Francisco. Housing prices in the city are skyrocketing out of the reach of ordinary citizens, and many are blaming the high-income individuals employed by companies like Facebook, Apple, and Google. ""We're very concerned that the tech industry is privatizing public transit."" Despite these concerns, there were no protesters lined up outside San Francisco City Hall before today's vote — but there were plenty of objections to the plan voiced prior to the vote. ""We're very concerned that the tech industry is privatizing public transit,"" said Jane Martin. ""We think the tech industry can do more."" A common refrain from objectors was that the buses should pay far more than a dollar per stop to make the income collected more equal to what those paying for public transportation have to pay. An animated citizen Steve Zeltzer said that ""this is a class warfare"" and questioned why these commuter shuttles were allowed to park in bus spots for years without the city doing anything about it. Indeed, a number of citizens commented on the fact that if they parked in a bus spot, they'd get smacked with a ticket for hundreds of dollars — but the commuter buses parked there without incident for years. As for data in favor of the vote, the SFMTA's research showed that nearly half of all regional shuttle riders and 27 percent of all intra-city shuttle riders they surveyed said they would drive alone if not for the shuttles; 59 percent of regional riders said they either sold their car or put off buying one because of the shuttles. Without shuttles, the companies argue, there'd be more cars on the road and more congestion in San Francisco itself. Without shuttles, the companies argue, there'd be more cars on the road  San Francisco supervisor Scott Wiener also came out to support the measure, saying that he was ""here today in strong support of the staff recommendation relating to employee shuttles."" Wiener also attempted to keep the issue focused specifically on transportation rather than sprawling out to encompass housing. ""Blaming employee shuttles, blaming tech workers is not a solution to our housing problems,"" he said. While the naysayers seemed to outnumber the supporters, there were a number of Google employees (as well as other citizens who don't use the shuttles) who showed up in favor of the pilot program — not to mention an employee of one of the shuttle bus programs who noted that his San Francisco-based company employs plenty of working-class citizens. ""I just wanted to say that not everyone at Google is a billionaire,"" said Crystal Sholts, a project manager at Google who rides the shuttle.

Kennedy notes that he never modified any URLs, just that he noticed that it was possible. Kennedy first testified about the issue before a Congressional committee in November, he says, but it still hasn't been resolved. It's just one of several issues he's identified with the site, and it's actually one of the easier ones to fix: Kennedy estimates it would take just a few days to hide the records. Deeper issues, such as a loophole that allows hackers to easily impersonate links coming from Healthcare.gov, would take longer to fix. Kennedy and other security experts believe that new features are also introducing new problems as changes are made to the site. The website is less secure than 50 percent of all the sites on the internet according to Security Headers, a website that tests basic configuration issues. The website is less secure than 50 percent of all the sites on the internet Unfortunately, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) the Health Department agency responsible for Healthcare.gov's development, hasn't responded to Kennedy's disclosures. CMS did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Healthcare.gov was supposed to allow Americans to shop for health insurance the way they might shop for a book on Amazon.com. Unfortunately, a rushed timeline and convoluted management lead to a disastrous launch that undermined public confidence in the website and the underlying health care reform law. The administration had to scramble to get the site fixed and the lead contractor has been fired. But in getting the basic issues fixed, it appears that the tech team may have let security precautions fall behind. It's easier for hackers to steal identities than ever — consider the wealth of personal information recently made available through the Target hack — and the more sources of information that can be cross-referenced, the better things are for thieves.

The 14-year-old boy, who suffered from severe autism, wandered away from his school in Long Island City, NY, last October. Oquendo's disappearance prompted a massive search effort, but unfortunately, it was a futile one: earlier today, officials announced that human remains found on a beach are indeed those of Oquendo.  Those conclusions were reached using DNA analysis, with investigators relying on a toothbrush and hair sample provided by Oquendo's family to conduct the tests. The remains in question (including two legs, an arm, and part of a skull) were found earlier this month, along with scraps of clothing that matched the description of what Oquendo was wearing when he went missing. The cause of his death has yet to be confirmed. Police and volunteers resorted to unconventional tactics Sadly, efforts to locate Oquendo stumped law enforcement from the get-go. As The Verge reported in October, many of the traits that characterize autism also increase the likelihood that children with autism will wander off and go missing — and often make them tougher to find when they do. In Oquendo's case, police and volunteers resorted to unconventional tactics during the search: in addition to posting flyers and scouring transit facilities, they played a recording of his mother's voice from a van that drove throughout New York.

They’re the kind of over-the-top you don’t get anywhere else, where seeing insane, surreal things is normal to the point of being mundane. Jason Derulo fits right in here. He has a castle. You know. No big deal. Last night, The Verge went to the Light Nightclub for iHeartRadio’s annual night of debauchery, where Derulo was scheduled to talk dirty to a crowd of reporters and corporate hangers on. If that sounds crazy, it absolutely is. To quote Nilay Patel, it’s one of the silliest parties at CES, since it’s there that you remember that not only does iHeartMedia have a lot of money, but it has enough money to outdo every other party in Vegas all in the name of an app few talk about. (iHeartRadio is actually approaching 60 million subscribers, but my friends and colleagues are not among them.) It’s a yearly tradition that’s given us Ke$ha dancing with a talking penis, so, God bless this mess, we had to go back. Sam. A video posted by Kwame Opam (@kwames) on Jan 1, 2015 at 10:17pm PST  The party did not disappoint. It was big, bright, and weird. Cirque du Soleil performers in nipple decor and not much else lurked in every corner. We nearly got blown away by onstage fog cannons, and freaked out when a man-sized bunny in jumping stilts crossed our path. Of all the unsettling things I’ve seen at CES, that hit my personal Top Five for ""What the fuck am I looking at?"" And I remember thinking, ""Oh God, just please let me get home!"" Midnight came, and Jason arrived, followed by an entourage wearing almost exclusively Jordan 13s. I was tipsy and had only a few minutes to ask my most burning questions, the most burning of which was the unaskable, ""Why is saying your name so fun?"" I settled on what CES has been like for him. ""It’s dope, man,"" he said. ""I just bought a castle just down the way, so I’m trying to link that thing up and make sure everything is comfortable. I’m really into technology. It just makes life easier."" Is there such a thing as a Connected Castle? He seemed pleased when he said that, but in the way you and I would be pleased about a new phone that needs setting up. Wiring castles is tough, man. And right then, I could feel the chasm between Jason’s celebrity and my own not-really-mattering threaten to swallow me whole. Celebrities have castles. Yeah, that’s not exactly beyond the pale. But the way he said it, later adding that the castle itself was built in the 1920s like it was just a piece of trivia, shook me. He was just so nonchalant about it. I pictured Xanadu from Citizen Kane filled with Jordans and women wiggling ""just a little bit."" But what about gadgets? I asked myself. Will it have a curved SUHD TV? Is there such a thing as a Connected Castle? How smart can a castle be? There wasn’t enough time to ask all these questions, though. I’m not even sure Jason Derulo has strong opinions about 4K and the Internet of Things. We talked about a variety of things — his drunken fans, his travels, Instagram — and I came away feeling like he’s a mostly regular guy enjoying his fame. ""My life is really fun,"" he said, likely knowing that his fun is nowhere near my fun. I did learn that he loves his iPhone 6 Plus and Galaxy Note. (He has big hands.) He’s probably using them in his castle right this second. I want a castle now. h2.ces-promo a{  background: #fa4b2a;  border-radius: 3px;  padding: 5px 14px 0px;  font-family: ff-din-web-condensed,Helvetica,sans-serif;  text-transform: uppercase;  font-weight: normal;  font-size: 30px;  text-align:center;  display:inline-block;  margin:0px auto;  color: #fff;}  h2.ces-promo a:hover {      background:#bf2a0d;      color:#fff;      text-decoration:none;    }} Update: The above article has been updated to include iHeartRadio's subscriber base.",0.4249524625555736,0.5750475374444264,0.1449998693276852,697,4.5810616929698709,428,5.6962616822429908,0,0,"CES 2015, Culture, Entertainment, Report",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

The Wu-Tang also announced an additional album — and that they would only produce one copy. Fans reportedly pooled together $5 million to buy the sole copy, but nothing materialized. We sat down with RZA, a Wu-Tang co-founder and one of its principal producers, to talk about both albums, the concept of music as tangible, exclusive art, and find out more about the Wu-Tang pay tier. The track ""Big Horn B"" is exclusive to people buying the limited-edition Wu-Tang Bombotix speaker. Most artists want to get their music out to everyone, using Spotify, Android, Pandora, etc. This has become a very exclusive song.  I think exclusivity is important in life. When you look at a hot pair of Jordans, not everybody got them — it's a limited run. You look at guitars. When Gibson made the robot guitar, it was a limited run. I had to wait in line and get mine. But that's a tangible object, a utilitarian function. This is art, this is expression. Even art becomes exclusive. If you wanna see the the Mona Lisa, you better have a ticket to France. But there are pictures of the Mona Lisa. It's not the real thing. The secret album. Did that really go out for like 5 million dollars? Is it in a vault somewhere? That was the highest offer that came in. I had a gag order, a non-disclosure agreement with the auction house, but I think I can talk about it now. ""This is all part of this idea of making music tangible and making it have a value within itself."" I would love to know what happened to it. We gave it to an auction house and they gonna handle the process. I'll say this. There's an auction house called Paddle8 — have you heard of them? Paddle8 is more modern like us, they understand the world we're in. So these are a group of guys who see the vision of what we're doing. They respect the idea of music being returned to art. It's the same thing with Boombotix; to me, this is all part of this idea of making music tangible and making it have a value within itself instead of just becoming something that's being devalued. I'm a big fan of technology, I've been a geek since 1986... and I was spending all my paper money on gadgets. Now we up to the level of streaming through Spotify and all these guys — and you can use [the Boombotix], of course, Spotify can stream through your a Bluetooth speaker. But the trick of it all, to me of this is that somebody will go and pay $300 for headphones, $600 for a phone or some device, and yet the device is most useful when music's playing through it, but you won't spend a dollar for a song, or ten dollars for an album. It's not logical. The reason why you got these great headphones — why you got these great gadgets — is because what it does for your media. If the consumer don't pay attention to him devaluing the media, where's the new concept gonna come from? Wu-Tang is on Spotify, we've seen Taylor Swift and others say that's it's devaluing the business model. Are you guys staying on there? What Taylor did was smart for her business, but to me, I like Spotify. It's like a new radio station. I like the fact that the music is accessible, but that's when you're listening, that's when you're maybe in the car or somewhere just going through it. I like you having music. People don't have turntables so I don't expect you to go buy a vinyl. People don't have cassette players so I don't expect you to go buy a cassette. If you put out an exclusive cassette, people will buy it. Well, I mean, that'd be a limited. We all are reaching toward our Bluetooth speakers — we're all looking for ways to hear our music. So how about you get you get the Bluetooth speaker, but you have your favorite artist. Not just Wu-Tang, but I think the whole music industry could use this. Think about if a company like Warner Bros. said, ""Ok, we're gonna take Warner Bros.'s classic 100 rock and roll songs and put it in a personal portable speaker for the consumer so he doesn't have to depend on his phone, or depend on the internet, or depend on any other force, to enjoy music."" I'd like to talk about Wu-Tang background. You are the principal producer, not just for Wu-Tang but for a bunch of people. You do say you're a gadget person. What's your set-up? Don't get jealous, anybody. I'm a gadget geek, so I have multiple set-ups. If you go in my dining room, which should be a dining room, I have the Maschine hooked up to my laptop. It's called the Maschine, by Native Instruments, yeah. I use that when I'm eating and I get an idea, I bang on the pads there. And if you go up to my living room, it's strictly digital piano that records for composing music. If you go next door I've got the new Motif, the new Korg, there's a company out of Sweden, the company's called Elektron, I've got all their product, I got every product they make. If you go to my studio then you'll find my rolling material, of course I love Pro Tools, that's industry standard, and I'm into New Window, I'm into Sonar, but I love Ableton. Ableton is very unique to their approach to music programming. I didn't know about Ableton til Mikey D, a producer who works with Kanye, he was like ""I do all things in Ableton."" I was like, ""Yeah but I need to touch my stuff."" But then I got the push that comes with it, and I'm having a lot of fun with it. Has your style evolved over the years? Do you see what you do versus when Wu-Tang first formed, versus even 15, 10 years ago when you started doing scores for Ghostdog. ""Technology causes us to be more creative and experiment more."" I think my style has evolved but I think I can go back and forth. You hear the new album and a song like ""Felt"" — I could've made that 20 years ago or a song like ""Pioneer the Frontier,"" those are the same drums from 36 Chambers. When you're hearing like Ruckus in B minor, you're hearing live instruments, you're hearing Ableton, you're hearing the Pioneer DJ set. You're hearing all these different elements that make this one song. Technology causes us to be more creative and experiment more. In the old days there was a quarter note delay, you had to patch one thing to another, patch it to another, walk over, twist it, then maybe get the tempo right. Now it's just like ""Yo,"" drag and drop. In interviews you talked about the Wu-Tang pay tier. Can you set the record straight on that? There was a pay tier. There was or there is? ""I put myself on the lower tier, because I don't agree with the concept."" There was. It should be over. I agreed to not contest it for a year, but I didn't agree with the pay system at all. I thought that it should be equality. That's what makes brotherhood. I know other bands and rock and roll, whether it's System of a Down, who I hang with — we equal. The Beatles broke up because they started talking about who wrote the songs and all this stuff. I thought equality was achieved by keeping the band together, because I know we all have a value. But I was outvoted. Not everybody, but the upper-tier guys wanted a tier system. So I was like okay, let's try it for a year. My idea was, if it works, it works. But what happens when someone in the lower tier becomes more valuable than the upper-tier guys? Well I put myself on the lower tier, because I don't agree with the concept. I said, let's go with the lower tier, and I'll stay here for a year, and you upper-tier guys go get yours. Here go a little bad news about it — it didn't really work. It didn't work because the upper tier started wanting to go a little upper. There's no end to it. Once you start something like that. I understand it works in basketball, it might work in football, but when you done with a band like Wu-Tang Clan, people are paying to see Wu-Tang Clan. They're not paying to see RZA, or paying to see GZA, or paying to see Method Man, or Ghostface, or Raekwon, or Masta Killer, they're paying to see all of us. Are you guys gonna tour soon? I think we will. Hopefully the system will be diminished by then. But if not, I'm just one voice — it's a democracy. If it was a dictatorship, I'd be like ""Yo man,"" *slaps air*, but it's a democracy so I go with the votes. What do you think about you and GZA and Raekwon, all of you are in the top 20 for largest hip-hop vocabulary. How does it feel to make some of the most sophisticated lyrics in hip hop? That was very flattering actually. The other guy, Aesop, I never really knew his music. I knew him from some years ago but I never really knew his music, but he had the highest. But it just shows that a lot of work goes into what we're doing. They didn't even count the Wu-Tang Clan, they only counted our solo albums, I was like, well I only had three solo albums, and I made it to the top 10. I need to drop some more solo albums, I might move up a rank! Just read a dictionary over a 4/4 beat, see what happens. I think it's the unique words, so you can't even just have a dictionary. I had one where I rhymed the word ""achievement"" with the word ""deviant."" I think of words that have different context but use words to define words. I like to do that when I write lyrics. You may not understand the first half of the sentence, but the second half explains it to you. One last question. What's next for you, and what's next for the Wu? Well this comes out this summer, the Boombotix Rex Plus, 2GB memory inside it. We're thinking of putting an album on it, so we'll see what happens. h2.ces-promo a{  background: #fa4b2a;  border-radius: 3px;  padding: 5px 14px 0px;  font-family: ff-din-web-condensed,Helvetica,sans-serif;  text-transform: uppercase;  font-weight: normal;  font-size: 30px;  text-align:center;  display:inline-block;  margin:0px auto;  color: #fff;}  h2.ces-promo a:hover {      background:#bf2a0d;      color:#fff;      text-decoration:none;    }}",0.4715074701800592,0.5284925298199408,0.3117950841930116,1871,4.322287546766435,772,5.7823834196891193,0,0,"CES 2015, Culture, Entertainment, Interview, Videos",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

But with the growing popularity of, say, Scandinavian crime shows or British black comedies it’s becoming exceedingly clear just how much TV talent is hiding overseas. To give you a peek at what’s out there, we’re taking an international tour of television’s best and weirdest. This time around, we’re headed to Russia.  Despite the internet’s limitless reach, for the most part American audiences watch American shows — until, that is, they’re bought up and remade a la      When Putin came to power in 2000, most Russians watched Brazilian and Mexican soaps, or cheap rip-offs of old American serials. Thanks in part to the country’s economic growth, today much of Russia’s entertainment television is homemade — but just as gaudy and absurd as the imported fare: on Jeopardy (aka Своя Игра), contestants wear wizard robes, and The Kitchen illustrates its protagonist’s emotions with kitschy, lewd animations. Despite the very serious geopolitical situation the country finds itself in, these shows portray a flourishing — if garden-variety dramatic — Russia. Recently, Russian TV shows have begun selling to other markets. A few months ago, Hulu partnered with the global video-on-demand studio Digital Media Rights to stream a handful of its Russian shows with (pretty horrendous) subtitles for English-language viewers. The shows stick tightly to their genres: comedies rely on slapstick humor and dramas revolve around age-old subjects like adultery and alcoholism. Thanks to mandatory military conscription, there are more army uniforms and plotlines involving PTSD than you find in American television. And parental advice — as well as characters living with their aging parents — figures prominently. Regardless, this batch of shows brings you some characters you’re probably well-acquainted with (corporate villains, spurned lovers, oblivious millennials) and some you aren’t — like a vigilante child support debt collector named Natasha. Watch if you: Like Fringe and X-files but yearned for more skinheads and smartphone-addicted ravers.    The Day After — not to be confused with the doom-laden made-for-TV tale of nuclear winter of the same name — is the kind of show that immediately inspires you to take bets on who’ll bite the dust first. From the moment when a group of strangers awaken in a cavernous and dimly lit bunker with no memory of how they arrived there, it’s essentially a race to see whose character traits will prove fatal first. This show’s got a truly committed spectrum of fully fledged stock caricatures: the terrified girl in a lacy dress tottering around on buckled knees, the pale creepy nerd who knows more than he’s letting on, and the foolish EDM-flavored millennial (a near shoe-in for Jesse Eisenberg) constantly training his phone’s camera on the action and narrating it as if he were a Big Brother contestant. Oh, then there’s the full-on skinhead tramping around the shady bunker like he’s in a circle pit. Elsewhere, diabolical bad guys — part-David Bowie, part-Donald Trump — finger-colored crystals and slowly leak their plans for world domination and / or salvation from behind the front of their mega-corporation (in the subtitles, Acme Corp). If you’re into shows like Fringe, the blend of mysticism and pseudoscience here will feel super familiar—the first few episodes alone feature chemical warfare, abandoned surgical equipment, inexplicably appearing mute children, and a scene from the afterlife.  Watch if: You want a CSI experience where deadbeat dads replace sex criminals. In 2010, Moscow officials reported that 98 percent of alimony in the city goes unpaid, which perhaps explains why a show about a vigilante child support debt collector makes sense in Russia. Natasha is the eponymous ex-wife struggling to care for her child on a lounge singer’s salary; when her former husband reappears after a few years only to dodge a court-ordered property seizure, she goes, understandably, a little bananas. Enraged, Natasha scribbles a manifesto disguised as a job application to federal services that declares, in rough translation, ""Fathers will pay for every single tear you shed."" She is immediately given a job on the strength of her punchy hand-written rant. In The Ex-Wife, the Russian federal services office is a fun-loving and deeply honorable place, which seems like a stretch. Then again, in Andy Sandberg’s Brooklyn Nine-Nine, the NYPD come off looking like a bunch of harmless and jovial pranksters. I was hoping justice might come in a swifter and bloodier form for the ex-husbands in this show, but unfortunately Natasha’s weapon of choice is talking gentle sense into deadbeat dads and repossessing their TVs, even as they train shotguns at her in vodka-soaked stupors. Watch if: You’d like a Top Chef-flavored office procedural where the main character has cartoon hallucinations and a top-notch sweater game. This show is so popular that it’s been spun off into both a feature-length film and a documentary about the making of said feature-length film. In The Kitchen, Max is a young and boastful wannabe chef who gets his start cooking in the army. Thanks to a series of mishaps, he lands in ""Claude Monet,"" one of the nicest restaurants in Moscow, only to be mercilessly hazed by his fellow cooks and the hulking alcoholic head chef. Dmitriy Nagiev, by all accounts a wildly popular actor in Russia, plays himself as the wealthy actor and owner of the restaurant: expect ample aviator sunglasses and miles of acid wash denim. This is a goofy slapstick sitcom, with extended comedic montages set to Western pop songs, emotive animated sequences, and lots of physical comedy with knives and pastry squeeze guns. Brace yourself for a painfully long and bizarre food-fetish sex scene in one of the first episodes. Watch if: you liked Twin Peaks but thought it could do with fewer midgets, magic, red velvet, coffee, donuts, sex workers, and dream sequences. It’s no Twin Peaks or Top of the Lake, but this atmospheric crime drama deals in a similar genre of misty small-town secrecy. Set among the epic snow drifts and ramshackle lodges of barely-settled Siberia, Pure Gold follows a scientist as she studies the area’s surrounding wilderness. When one of her soil samples is stolen and the thief who nicked it is brutally stabbed, she joins a local — played by Evgenij Pronin, basically Mother Russia’s Matt Damon — in tracking it down. Spoiler: the soil isn’t soil at all, but gold, of such purity as to be near-magical. As the scientist and her new friend race across snowdrifts and trade thinly veiled declarations of love, they’re alternately pursued and sweet-talked by the square-shouldered local sheriff and various crusty Siberian residents, all of whom know far more than they’re letting on. This show nails, if not the dramatic tension, at least the male lead: Matt Damonovsky plays the wounded small-town ex-con with a boy-band level of soulful eyebrow action. Watch if: Orange is the New Black appealed to you but you’d prefer to think of prison as a hetero dating service. If the shows on Hulu are a reliable sample group, Russian TV has no shortage of spurned and mistreated women. But no woman is more screwed over than Tatiana, who stars in Love Formula, a romance show about going to prison. Tatiana, devoted wife and mother, dotes on her wealthy husband and only child, the latter of whom harbors dreams of government work and is engaged to be married. But on the night of a celebration, he gets drunk and hits a woman with his car. In a veritable fit of martyrdom, Tatiana takes the fall for his crime and winds up in a penal colony—a prison which looks downright lovely, considering what we know about incarceration in Russia. The bulk of the show centers around the interpersonal dramas that plague Tatiana: her spoiled son’s wedding goes on without her; her husband shacks up with his mistress; and Tatiana, jealous and then enraged, finds herself going doe-eyed for a kind and handsome fellow prisoner.",0.5886611429864017,0.4113388570135983,0.8610237969675826,1355,5.1557195571955718,783,6.5070242656449553,0,20,"Culture, Entertainment",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

But since the script was written in 2005, it has struggled to find a home. Thanks to Amazon Studios, it looks like that will finally change. ""We always had too many ideas to fit into the feature."" The show takes place in a Victorian-esque fantasy world filled with magical creatures, and the original script focused on a detective in search of a serial killer, though it's unclear if the TV series will follow the same route. According to del Toro, the shift from film to television will allow him and his writing team to expand the world quite a bit. ""We always had too many ideas to fit into the feature,"" he told The Hollywood Reporter. ""We can now really focus on the world and the politics of what it is to be a magical being in Victorian steampunk atmosphere where you are seen as a lesser being."" Carnival Row is still in development, so there's no word on when it might debut on Amazon's streaming service, or who might be starring in it. del Toro fans may want to hedge their excitement, however — Amazon recently cancelled its new sci-fi series from X-Files creator Chris Carter before a single episode was filmed.

Services like AIM and ICQ let us stay in touch not just through chat, but through away messages — tiny fragments letting friends know what you were up to while away from your keyboard. (The indispensable YourAwayMessage offers a representative sample.) Today, Facebook is bringing those fragments back with what it's calling the ""sidebar status"" — a kind of away message you can post in the sidebar of its mobile apps for iOS and Android. The sidebar, which you bring up by swiping right in Facebook's flagship app, currently shows your most frequently messaged friends. Starting today, in a test that Facebook is running in Taiwan and Australia, users will see short status messages under their friends' names: ""making blueberry scones at home,"" say, or ""watching the game at home."" (Twitter was once derided as a place where people only posted about what they had for breakfast; the away message was a place where you could share your breakfast without shame.)   Messages can be accompanied with a little picture icon; Facebook has created dozens to choose from. Your messages show up only in the sidebar — you won't see them in the News Feed, or on your profile — and they expire in 12 hours, or whenever you post a new one. And they come with fairly robust privacy settings: by default, your friends can see them, but you can restrict it in much the same way you can limit access to your profile. Facebook does save your old status messages, but they're visible only to you. A more intimate, ephemeral news feed It's not quite right to call these ""away"" messages, of course, because these days we're never really ""away"" in the way we were in the era of desktop computing. But sidebar statuses have the same look and feel, and they're intended for the same audience that away messages were: your closest friends. Of course, there was a time when Facebook's main News Feed was for your close friends, too. But over the years, the feed has become more cluttered: with ads, news stories, videos, and distant acquaintances.   Sidebar status messages appear most prominently for your ""favorites,"" a dynamically generated list of friends based on who you message most on Facebook. (You can also pin your favorites to the top, and scroll down to see more distant friends' updates.) ""People were having a difficult time staying in touch with their friends and seeing what they're doing on a daily basis,"" Sue Young, a Facebook product manager, said in an interview. The idea behind the sidebar status, she said, is that ""small things would make people feel connected in a big way."" She added: ""Now when I visit the sidebar, I can get an instant pulse of what all my friends are doing."" Of course, the sidebar isn't exactly prime real estate in Facebook's mobile app. Many users may not even be aware that it exists. But if Facebook rolls out the sidebar status broadly — and Young says she hopes to — I wouldn't be surprised to see people using it more. It's a throwback idea that scratches an itch most of us still have — to tell our closest friends what we're up to, and to hear the same from them. Even if it's only what we had for breakfast.

The $99.99 Up2, available beginning today, slots in between the basic $49 Jawbone Move that can be tossed in your pocket and the $179 flagship Up3 wrist band, which houses additional sensors capable of reading heart rate, skin temperature, and so on. (And yes, it's finally about to start shipping.) But Jawbone thinks this middle device will appeal to the widest range of consumers. It's the new mainstream model. Designed by Yves Behar, the Up2 is 45 percent smaller than the Up24; it's also smaller than the more feature-rich Up3. Jawbone says it'll last seven days on a charge, is splash-resistant, and can be taken in the shower without any problems. The Up2's sensors are now shielded by an aluminum shell, but aside from this and other refinements to its size and design, you're basically looking at the same essentials that went into the Up24. Jawbone's latest fitness device will track your sleep patterns, daily activity, and it can vibrate to remind you of an alarm or urge you to get moving after you've been sitting too long.   But more than the new hardware, Jawbone is really putting the focus on its smartphone apps and Smart Coach. Smart Coach is the company's health system that offers personalized tips on improving your sleep, diet, and being more active. For instance, if it notices you tend to have a higher step count after a good night's rest, Smart Coach will likely encourage you to head to bed earlier to keep that progress going. It's all a bit more helpful if you're using the Up3, since that fitness tracker also monitors your resting heart rate and can go deeper into analyzing sleep habits thanks to its added sensors. But Jawbone thinks the Up2 will be a fine entry point into greater fitness awareness for many people. You can order one in black starting today at Jawbone's web store, Amazon, and Best Buy.

The ability to double as a mobile wallet is usually reserved for pricier smartwatches like the Apple Watch and smartphones themselves. But Jawbone seems to think that its wrist-worn health trackers are the perfect vehicle for NFC payments. Today, the company is announcing Up4, an upgraded version of the Up3 (which is finally, only now about to start shipping) that adds an NFC chip necessary to pay on the go. It'll ship this summer for $199 versus the $179 you'd pay for the Up3. An American Express card on your wrist The thinking behind this seems to be that since runners and other athletes often try to carry as little around with them as possible, it shouldn't take much to convince them to ditch their wallet. But Jawbone's entry into the mobile payments business has one big limitation: only American Express cardholders can use it. The company has partnered closely with AmEx on the new feature. Existing members will be able to use their regular account credentials to link their card with the Up4, but everyone else will be able to apply for an American Express card and (potentially) receive instant approval. But it's not exactly seamless; after registering your card with Jawbone's app, you'll have to jump over to the AmEx app to see recent transaction history and other account details. American Express' Leslie Berland told The Verge this split is meant to protect sensitive customer data.   And both companies say they're taking security seriously; like Apple Pay, AmEx's system uses tokenization to hide your true credit card number from merchants and replace it with a different one dedicated to mobile payments. And while it's theoretically as fast, Jawbone's system doesn't sound nearly as elegant as Apple's. Since there's no screen or any kind of speaker on Up4, you'll be relying solely on a store's payment terminal to verify that the NFC transaction went through. The ability to pay with a tap is reserved exclusively for proper American Express credit card holders, with no prepaid alternative available for people with a spotty credit record. Meanwhile, Apple is regularly adding to the already sizable list of banks and credit card companies behind Apple Pay. Jawbone is unlikely to match that anytime soon, but if you're an American Express holder and you really want to buy things with your wrist, you'll soon be able to do it for a couple hundred bucks — and get what sounds like a pretty decent health tracker as part of the deal.",0.48491564936145837,0.5150843506385416,0.16292510469291172,441,4.925170068027211,260,5.7692307692307692,0,2,Tech,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

But it's melting much faster than most studies previously predicted. As early as 2020 and no later than 2050, it will be almost completely ice-free, according to a new paper out this week. ""It's pretty scary how rapidly all this Arctic change is happening,"" said James Overland, lead author of the new study, and a research oceanographer with the US National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). ""The Arctic is a real indicator of global change here, that's why we wrote the paper,"" he told The Verge.    ""It's pretty scary how rapidly all this Arctic change is happening."" Specifically, Overland explained that the loss of the majority of Arctic sea ice during future summer melt seasons will have three major impacts: it will open the door for drilling and shipping in the region, it will ruin the habitats for polar bears and marine mammals, and eventually, it could cause more extreme weather events for us who live down in the more southern latitudes. ""It's hard right now to say that 'this particular snowstorm two years ago was caused by what was going on in the Arctic,' or that the path of Hurricane Sandy was caused by Arctic changes, but there are indications we will see more extreme weather as the Arctic warms up."" Graph of sea ice loss maximum and minimum from 1979 through 2013, from the National Snow and Ice Data Center. It's important to point out that the Arctic is likely to still always be covered by a little bit of ice, according to Overland and his colleague's projections, and other future models of Earth's temperature. ""Ten to fifteen percent will still be there during the winter,"" said Overland. Every year, large areas — hundreds of thousands of square miles across — of Arctic sea ice melt during the summer and refreeze each winter, part of a naturally occurring seasonal process. ""There are indications we will see more extreme weather as the Arctic warms up."" But the amount of sea ice lost in the summer has been exacerbated in recent years by global warming, which Overland and others have linked to a rise in human produced greenhouse gas emissions. Last year saw a record amount of sea ice melt, according to NOAA. And overall, the trend is going way down. ""We've already lost three fourths of the sea ice volume since the 1980s,"" Overland said.

Founded in 1836, the Maryland-based NLM is home to the world's largest collection of biomedical resources, including old books, videos, and scientific studies. It also houses a fascinating online collection of public service announcements and health-related propaganda — a century-spanning trove of posters, advertisements, and pamphlets from just about every corner of the globe.    ""It's meant to be cultural, in the broadest sense of the word,"" Paul Theermin, head of the NLM's images and archives, said in an interview with The Verge. Until the 1950s, the NLM operated in tandem with the National Museum of Health and Medicine. When it split off, the clinical materials were placed with the Armed Forces Medical Library (now under the Department of Defense), leaving the NLM to manage all social and cultural documents.     The NLM, now under the domain of US Health and Human Services, launched its first website in the 1990s, before ramping up its efforts in 2009 with the launch of its Images from the History of Medicine (IHM) database. Today, its online collection encompasses more than 70,000 digitized images, 42,000 of which are in the public domain. Collection manager Ginny Roth says she aims to upload between 600 and 700 new documents each year, pulling from NLM's existing physical archive, as well as new materials received from donors or other public institutions. Thus far, the library hasn't digitized even half of its archive.     The majority of NLM's images are portraits — centuries-old drawings of renowned doctors — though there are thousands of photographs, as well — slice-of-life stills of old hospital wards and patients. But perhaps most intriguing is its collection of public health posters. Some are iconic relics from the global AIDS campaign, others are more obscure, puzzling, or implicitly racist. Each, however, is its own time capsule — a snapshot of not only the major public health issues from a given era, but the aesthetic, political, and social norms that informed their visual representation.

""It's the volatility that really makes the supply chain... just a complete train wreck."" The anitmalarial artemisinin is currently produced using artemisinic acid farmed from the soft wormwood tree, and as a result, prices can vary wildly between $350 and $1250 per kilogram as supply fluctuates based on crop yields and other factors. The yeast strain used in the study was engineered by a biotech startup called Amyris, whose chief scientific officer Jack Newman tells NPR,  ""It's the volatility that really makes the supply chain for this life-saving drug just a complete train wreck."" It's hoped that augmenting existing production of artemisinin with the new semi-synthetic version can fill shortages in supply without distorting the market price, so as not to impact farmers in China, Vietnam, and elsewhere. Scientists have been exploring the baker's yeast approach for years, but previous methods have only been able to produce weak artemisinic acid solutions of about 1.6 grams per liter. In contrast, the newly-published study cranks that to 25 grams per liter, for the first time enabling real industrial-scale production.

On Friday, an international team of researchers will publish their latest findings on Australopithecus sediba — a uniquely puzzling prehuman species that lived nearly 2 million years ago. Led by Lee Berger, a paleoanthropologist at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, South Africa, the research reveals new insights about the way Au. sediba walked, chewed, and moved, lending support to Berger's claim that the species is a direct human ancestor. Experts have long identified Homo habilis as the most likely ancestor to Homo erectus — the precursor to modern man — but Berger’s research points to an alternate lineage. Au. sediba predated Homo habilis by nearly 100,000 years, according to some estimates, and its ""mosaic"" blend of ape and human qualities suggests a different evolution from human ancestors (known as hominins) to our own Homo genus. ""Everywhere we see evidence of evolution."" The six papers to be published in Science tomorrow only underscore this hypothesis. A study of Au. sediba's dental structure shows that while the species shared some similarities with the Homo genus, it was distinct from the Au. afarensis — a class of East African hominins that includes Lucy, the famed prehistoric skeleton discovered in 1974. This so-called ""Lucy species"" has been widely accepted as the common ancestor from which all prehumans sprung, but Berger says this hypothesis now seems ""very unlikely."" Instead, he argues, it appears that Au. sediba represents a ""ghost lineage"" completely divorced from Lucy and her East African contemporaries.   The team's other studies reveal similarly mosaic qualities in Au. sediba's spine, thorax, and jawbone — a feature they found to be surprisingly humanlike in structure, and markedly different from Au. africanus ""ape-man"" fossils found in the same region. The creature's arms exhibit qualities ideal for climbing, but its fossilized lower limbs point to bipedal movements, as well. ""Everywhere we look in these skeletons, from the jaws on down to the feet, we see evidence of the transition from australopith to Homo,"" Darryl de Ruiter, a professor at Texas A&M University and co-author of one of the papers, said in a statement. ""Everywhere we see evidence of evolution."" ""Au. sediba looks more like Homo than any other australopith known,"" de Ruiter explained in an e-mail to The Verge, ""and for this reason represents an excellent candidate ancestor for the genus Homo."" Boy meets skeleton Friday's publication comes after more than four years of research on Au. sediba, marking one of the most comprehensive studies of a prehuman species ever conducted. The species was first discovered in 2008, when Berger's then-nine-year-old son stumbled upon a fossilized clavicle bone near the Malapa caves of South Africa. Berger later discovered more bones belonging to the specimen — a young boy — as well as the partial skeleton of an adult female. Subsequent research on these and other samples returned enigmatic results. Its hand, for instance, featured elongated fingers ideal for scaling trees, as well as an unusually long thumb that Au. sediba, like early humans, could have used to hold tools. Standing at little more than four feet tall, the species also had a small, apelike brain, albeit one with a more human shape and organization.  Composite reconstruction of Au. sediba (center); for comparison, small-bodied female modern Homo sapiens on left, male Pan troglodytes on right. Image credit: Lee Berger, courtesy of the University of the Witwatersrand De Ruiter acknowledges that these findings remain open to interpretation, largely due to a still-incomplete fossil record. Nevertheless, he says that the growing body of evidence strongly suggests that ""we are looking at the ancestor of the genus Homo, or at least a very close relative of that ancestor."" Detractors have argued that Au. sediba is too young to have been a direct ancestor to the Homo genus, citing some Homo habilis fossils estimated to be 2.3 million years old. Berger and his team dispute these estimates, instead claiming that Homo habilis arose 1.9 million years ago, and that purportedly older fossils are too fragmentary to rely upon. They also note that the remains found in South Africa are but one sample; there could be far older Au. sediba fossils that have yet to be unearthed. Teasing out this lineage remains a daunting task, despite the relative abundance and remarkable quality of Au. sediba fossils. ""an unprecedented look at an early hominin species"" ""We're getting an unprecedented look at an early hominin species in a field that is generally identified by fragments, and often very small fragments,"" Berger tells The Verge, citing the species' nearly intact hand, leg, and skull bones. ""So we're beginning to see a record that's more complete than we've ever had before."" But Berger's blessing may also be a curse. Without well-preserved fossils from other species, it's difficult to piece together a clear evolutionary trajectory, leaving the field in a haze of speculation. ""Sediba stands as this remarkably complete nature, but there’s almost nothing to compare it to in Homo habilis,"" Berger explains, though he notes that amidst this uncertainty lies an exciting opportunity — a chance to rewrite human evolution, or, at the very least, to explore new avenues. ""This leaves us with an enormous question,"" he says. ""We thought we knew how this part of human evolution worked, and sediba comes along and says, 'Here's another option.'""",0.8653237790726636,0.13467622092733644,0.8561858290653196,940,5.25,496,6.473790322580645,0,0,"Science, Report",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

As detailed in The New England Journal of Medicine, the studies involved 114 different individuals, who had their brains scanned using functional magnetic resonance imaging. During the scans, they were exposed to heat of varying degrees while being asked to rate their pain level on a scale of one to nine. The researchers then looked at the resulting brain scans, and discovered a common pattern of activity. By keying off this signature, they were able to differentiate between which subjects were simply feeling heat and which ones were feeling pain from the exposure. In the first study, the technique was successful 94 percent of the time, while the second study yielded a 93 percent success rate. The intensity of the signature pattern also decreased when pain medication was administered to subjects. In a third study, some subjects that had recently gone through relationship break-ups were shown pictures of their former partners to add emotional pain to the mix. In that case, the signature was able to determine which subjects were feeling pain 85 percent of the time, and was able to determine which were simply feeling emotional distress 73 percent of the time. The study has enormous potential benefits in both pain management and helping treat those who may be unable to express whether they're feeling pain for one reason or another. It could also be of use for doctors that are trying to objectively determine whether patients are in pain, whether they say they are or not. That said, further research will need to be done. The researchers note that different kinds of pain felt in other parts of the body could result in their own distinct pain signatures, and the studies as conducted did not address chronic pain that individuals may have to deal with over the course of a lifetime due to illness or other maladies.",0.4355175885730097,0.5644824114269903,0.8312622148319466,335,4.9701492537313436,186,5.774193548387097,0,0,Science,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

He had been fighting cancer since 2013. ""It made the situation easier to deal with.""

It was the only time the family was able to laugh in days ... We were all laughing, and it made the situation easier to deal with."" Merrill's cause of death wasn't the only part of his life ripped from the pages of fictional worlds. Every day, he reported to work at a retail store call The Big Shop in Legoland. Merrill worked in a world full of toys, where Lego came to life. His coworkers even sent the family a Lego gift after learning of Merrill's death. He had been known as ""Bread,"" so they made no less than a loaf of bread out of Lego to honor his death.

This week, we explored the possibility of ending world hunger with GMOs, considered Google's relationship to a famous architect, and spoke to Spider-Man writer Dan Slott. We'll also be setting you up for a stellar weekend back on this terrestrial plane. So sit back and take a journey with us. We learned this week that the US government was considering stricter guidelines for meat and sugar consumption, so now might be a good time to visit a McDonald’s museum. This one in Illinois is a replica of the fast food chain’s ninth store, complete with the restaurant’s original equipment and mannequins dressed in a classic McDonald’s uniform. Image via Atlas Obscura. The annual Lunar New Year parade winds through Little Italy and Chinatown this Sunday. Brave the cold to watch traditional lion dances and colorful ceremonies while gnawing on steaming street meat. And, just in case you didn’t know, this is the Year of the Sheep. Image via NYC Go. Genetically modified crops have the potential to dramatically increase how much food farmers can grow, which is why Bill Gates believes that they'll play a big role in reducing global issues with hunger. But GMOs aren't everything: growing more food is good, but it doesn't mean that the food will get where it's needed. Did Google steal the life's work of a famous architect? Eli Attia spent decades developing a process to revolutionize how we design and construct new buildings — he wanted Google to make that work a reality, but now he claims that Google is doing it without him. We caught up with Dan Slott — the writer who oversees Spider-Man — to talk about the hero's big news: that he's joining Marvel's Cinematic Universe. Slott chats with us about what classic stories he'd like to see on film, which Spider-Man movies he actually liked, and what movie execs should consider when recasting the hero. Imagine sitting on your couch, putting on a virtual-reality headset, and getting a 3D, court-side view of the latest basketball game. The NBA isn't there yet, but it's working with Samsung to explore just how far VR can go. We dropped by an All-Star event in New York to see the collaboration in action. Sony CEO Kaz Hirai said this week that Sony was going to narrow its focus onto the PlayStation — at the cost of ignoring or giving up on pretty much everything else, from mobile phones to TVs. That may sound unthinkable, but the PlayStation may be Sony's best bet for newfound success. MediumMac McClelland reports on France’s police force, detailing the aggressive ways in which officers reacted to the Charlie Hebdo massacre and its aftermath. Theo’s unit was part of the Peloton Spécialisé de Protection de la Gendarmerie, stationary but highly specialized, securing one of the country’s 19 nuclear power plants. All his unit did was talk about terrorism. Subsidized by the energy company whose property they protected, PSPG had more, and bigger, guns than regular units. Twice a day they did counter-terrorism exercises. Imagine: a bomb scenario. Drill: maneuvers for an organized attack. Rolling StoneDavid Kushner details the life of John Willis Junior, a nobody from Massachusetts who somehow became the kingpin of a massive American drug cartel. He made sure no one would fuck with him either. He threw himself into weightlifting – and steroids. 'He went from a chubby kid to a monster,' his childhood friend Sean Gaudet tells me. But he fit right in with his boyhood crew. 'He was a regular neighborhood kid,' recalls another old friend, Brant Welty, 'we all used to run around in the streets getting in trouble.' Hopes&Fears Hopes&Fears’ anonymous interview series profiles a night guard at a museum, who talks about what it’s really like to patrol an empty museum when the sun goes down. There’s a room in the American Wing that a lot of people avoid if they can help it because people have seen the cradle rocking at night, apparently. And they get this very intense feeling when they’re inside. It’s funny, because the offices where I get the heebie jeebies from are directly above that. One of the people who’s been there for a long time was telling me that it was a storage area before they turned them into offices. And people used to hear voices up there at night. Outside Will Grant meets mining prospector Flint Carter and follows a hand-drawn treasure map looking for gold in Arizona’s Sonoran Desert. 'That right there would make any miner happy,' he said, nodding at the table. He picked up one of the samples and held it to the dusky light. He moved his hand over the rock, covering it in shadow. 'If it’s gold, it shines even when it’s shaded.' The New York Times Tyler Cowen argues that the act of waiting in line has economic benefits, and often makes something seem cooler than it is. Lately I have noticed a small but perhaps not insignificant increase in ""waiting culture"" in Washington. Two of the town’s best (and relatively new) restaurants — Little Serow and Rose’s Luxury — refuse to take reservations under normal circumstances. I am frustrated by the resulting lines, but it reflects the emergence of Washington as a wealthy and indeed ""cool"" city with some special places that generate buzz. Casual fans will recognize José González for his finger-plucked cover of The Knife's ""Heartbeats,"" but Vestiges & Claws is a fully matured collection of delicate, hushed indie folk that's easy to appreciate on first listen. This San Francisco trio traipse through melodic, woozy pop at a leisurely pace. One listen to Talent Night at the Ashram will have you forgetting about the wintry hellscape in front of you and thinking about the fleeting summer crushes that await you. This new game for iOS is almost captivatingly chill. It's a simple automatic runner game where players must jump across valleys and treacherous ski slopes. But it's the world around those slopes that will lure you in; stunning animation of sun-drenched mountains and delicately falling snowflakes provides the backdrop to the most relaxing snowboarding experience you'll ever have. Despite our lukewarm feelings about Interstellar, we recognize the best way to see it is in IMAX. And this weekend you can do just that — the space flick is returning to select IMAX screens at AMC theaters this Saturday, February 21st.

Its aim is to see what genres you like the most — say, horror with a mix of mid-90s sitcoms — and pair you off with someone, so the two of you can pretend to watch Friends while either making out on the couch or being completely awkward because who is this person? It's like Cuddlr, but for the lonely souls who can't stop binge-watching their favorite TV shows. (Read: all of us at some point in our lives, because that was a dumb study.) We can concede that this idea is either brilliant or potentially super creepy.  But that's dating in the Tinder age, and yes, going to bars that smell like Fireball and regret truly sucks.

At a tech event, most companies have just a handful of products. Some have just one or two. Even a gigantic company like Samsung might be showing off no more than 50 different devices in all: a dozen TVs, a handful of phones, a line of computers, and a handful of washing machines, smart home fixtures, watches, and (now) VR headsets. But at Toy Fair, which is held every year in New York, even a small booth might have a dozen board games or walls full of action figures. Lego had exactly 331 new sets covering Star Wars, Batman, Jurassic World, Ant-Man, pirates, elves, spies, New York City architecture, and more. Toy giants Mattel and Hasbro have entire show floors to themselves packed with untold hundreds of toys. At Mattel’s private upper-level booth, Barbie meets Halo and elaborate Hot Wheels sets give way to smart cradles with remote rocking technology. At The Verge, our job is to sift through and pick out the most futuristic bits. I can only imagine what it’s like to cover everything. So. Many. Toys. So what was the future of toys in 2015? Two very different companies were making cloud-powered talking companions — ""Hello Barbie"" remembered your hobbies and gave you (dubious) career advice, and startup Elemental Path's Watson-powered dinosaur fired off math questions and cracked knock-knock jokes. (To put it mildly, we’re not making Turing-test-worthy toys just yet; kids can look forward to memorizing the exact phrasing and voice volume that will elicit a response.) Besides the classic superhero franchises, excitement started growing for Jurassic World, which is heralding an always-welcome boom of dinosaurs. And companies like Crayola and Hasbro are figuring out how to add digital twists to their offline classics. But a lot of the show was defined by what wasn’t there: namely, anything based on the upcoming Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Companies had to make do with enigmatic boxes and banners — Lego even seemed a little apologetic about the absence of Force Awakens sets on its wall full of Star Wars merchandise from the first six films. On the one hand, that means no hints at the most anticipated geek movie of the year. On the other hand, it does mean there's a whole other wave of toys to look forward to later this year. Photography by Dante D'Orazio. Correction February 23rd, 3:30pm: We originally referred to startup Elemental Path by its toy line, CogniToys.  Anki Overdrive was undoubtedly one of the coolest toys at the show. It combines video game combat racing with real cars and a real track.   Crayola's Color Alive Easy Animation Studio ($24.99) brings a page from a coloring book to life as a 3D model that you can then animate using a mannequin. The Force Awakens loomed over Toy Fair 2015, but no one was allowed to show off anything from the film. That meant the floor was scattered with blank boxes like these that promised ""some play value."" That didn't stop toy companies from pumping out products tied to earlier Star Wars films, like this Wookiee Furby.  If Furby's not your style, you could also build your very own (extremely dangerous) lightsaber design with this new set from Hasbro. We're pretty sure any of these would kill you instantly. Naturally, this was the first lightsaber we built. Knock-offs are a big problem in the toy business -- that's why all the major booths at Toy Fair are fortresses of secrecy accessible by appointment only. Within Lego's massive booth lay over 300 new sets, including, for the first time ever, a Scooby-Doo set for the new film. Lego is integrating its sets with an app for the first time -- this set uses small carbon-fiber pieces that can be read by the iPad's screen. Kids must build special tools to unlock secrets in a comic book-style story. Of course, licensed toys are huge every year, and the new Jurassic World movie means dinosaurs are back. Check out this story for even more Legos at Toy Fair 2015. These raptor claws and heads on the left go on your hands to make a cool pair of gloves. The best part? They're actually in the film. Toy companies are always looking to exploit new licensing opportunities. The awkward Urban Dictionary Game is a mix between Pictionary and Trivial Pursuit, with plenty of memes tossed in for good measure. Life isn't complete without an app, right? This ""SmartConnect"" Fisher-Price set lets you control your baby's cradle or nursery mobile with your phone. The most high-tech Barbie ever can carry simple conversations -- if you speak clearly and ask the right questions. An internet connection is necessary for voice processing in the cloud, but the matching real-life Barbie is strictly optional. This dinosaur from startup CogniToys is similar to the Hello Barbie -- it uses IBM's Watson to answer questions from elementary school kids.  You can always find plenty of traditional models and action figures at Toy Fair. This Hulk Buster ($199.99) and Hulk ($69.99) from Age of Ultron will be available later this year from Kotobukiya. There are plenty of toys based on The Walking Dead -- this impressive set from McFarlane toys would cost you about $400 to build. There are plenty of traditional toys, too -- these cute wooden cars from Scandinavian company Playsam and ABS plastic cars from Playforever Toys would be just at home on a desk as in a child's hand.  There's also a whole section dedicated to board games. This brand new portable edition of Catan is designed so you won't lose the pieces. It'll be available this summer for $45.

Since the passage of Measure B in 2012, which strictly imposes the use of condoms on all porn sets in Los Angeles, triple-x movie production has largely begun to move out of the San Fernando Valley. However, gay porn company Falcon Studios is now attempting to hearken back to the days before the measure was passed. In their latest release California Dreamin' 1, the studio filmed all its scenes with condoms but managed to digitally remove the prophylactics in post-production. ""I felt that condoms need to be addressed."" Director Tony DiMarco stated on the Falcon Studio blog (which has some graphic content) that the film is meant to tap into fantasies of bareback sex in the 1970s and 80s, while also aligning with the safe sex ethos that is currently being enforced in LA. ""With this movie I really wanted to capture the essence of that time, when life seemed more carefree and spontaneous,"" said Dimarco. ""In keeping with this concept, I felt that condoms need to be addressed."" The decision to go with this technique appears to strike a middle ground between Measure B and the porn industry's belief that scenes without condoms are a better sell with consumers. Nevertheless, while Falcon Studios seems committed to their new style of filming, it's unclear if it will catch on. The company doesn't make clear how expensive it is to painstakingly remove condoms during sex scenes — a luxury that the porn industry, already culturally disinclined to use condoms in lieu of other modes of safe sex, may not be able to afford. Indeed, in the midst of rampant piracy on top of Measure B, many studios have relocated to Las Vegas, where filmmaking is cheaper and regulations are more lax.",0.46953497843822467,0.5304650215617753,0.8329529577278265,295,4.8779661016949154,189,5.71957671957672,0,0,"Culture, Entertainment, Policy & Law, US & World",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

While Obama mostly stays on-point throughout the piece, not letting his guard down enough to say anything truly out-of-character, there are still a number of worthwhile stories throughout. He called marijuana less dangerous than alcohol ""in terms of its impact on the individual consumer"" — but was more concerned with the disproportionate number of marijuana arrests that land minorities and the poor in jail and less interested in whether or not it should be made legal. He also reiterated the same message he's been pushing around the NSA. He said that the media's coverage of Edward Snowden's leaks paints ""a picture of a rogue agency out there running around and breaking a whole bunch of laws and engaging in a 'domestic spying program' that isn't accurate. But what that does is it synchs up with a public imagination that sees Big Brother looming everywhere."" More concerning to Obama is how these leaks have damaged the country's relationship with foreign leaders, who now feel heightened suspicion towards the country. As for possibly pardoning Snowden, Obama certainly wouldn't say for sure what he was thinking — but he didn't rule it out, either. ""I do not have a yes / no answer on clemency for Edward Snowden,"" Obama said. He went on to note that it was an active, ongoing case with charges pending — so he probably isn't in the position yet to make such a judgement. As for Snowden's actions, Obama summed up his concerns as such: ""Is the only way to [raise questions about the NSA's actions] by giving some twenty-nine-year-old free rein to basically dump a mountain of information, much of which is definitely legal, definitely necessary for national security, and should properly be classified?""

Congress is still debating that question, but today a federal appeals court ruled that there's no difference when it comes to defamation. In 2011, blogger Crystal Cox lost a trial when an Oregon judge denied her a First Amendment protection traditionally reserved for the press. She claimed that Obsidian Finance Group was guilty of tax fraud — which was false, it appears — and a jury awarded Obsidian $2.5 million in damages. Normally, Obsidan would have had to prove that Cox was negligent to recover some of that money from Cox, and that prove she acted with ""actual malice"" to get the rest. However, those rules came from Supreme Court cases that only applied to journalists — cases that predated blogging — and at the time, the Oregon judge decided that Cox didn't have the credentials of a journalist. Today, however, the appeals court decided it doesn't matter whether Cox is part of the traditional press. Wrote Judge Marco Hernandez: ""The protections of the First Amendment do not turn on whether the defendant was a trained journalist, formally affiliated with traditional news entities, engaged in conflict-of-interest disclosure, went beyond just assembling others' writings, or tried to get both sides of a story. As the Supreme Court has accurately warned, a First Amendment distinction between the institutional press and other speakers is unworkable."" ""In defamation cases, the public-figure status of a plaintiff and the public importance of the statement at issue — not the identity of the speaker — provide the First Amendment touchstones,"" added the judge. Cox's case isn't over, though. Obsidian can still attempt to prove that she was negligent, or harbored actual malice, at a new trial. That might not be an impossible task. According to court documents, Cox didn't contest the jury's decision that her blog post was false and defamatory. And according to a New York Times story from 2011, Cox may have been trying to blackmail the organization. She sent Obsidian Finance a letter suggesting that the company pay her $2,500 a month for her to fix the damage to its reputation. In a much stranger story of a blogger facing a defamation case, former sports reporter Roger Schuler currently sits in an Alabama jail, charged with contempt of court.

Tuesday night, I attended Spotify Supper, an annual party for buyers, marketers, publicists, celebrities, general business folk, and party beat reporters. Located deep within the caverns of the Bellagio, in a gold-trimmed nightclub called The Bank, guests were served a mix of good food, good music, and brief business pitches.    Spotify commissioned a menu from Marcus Samuelsson, the chef behind Red Rooster Harlem and Ginny's Supper Club in New York. As our sister-site Eater has noted, Samuelsson's a master of comfort food. The meal featured fried chicken bites, shrimp and grits, and a smattering of other nibble-ables. Samuelsson also selected the night's music: landmark rap group De La Soul. The trio maintained a stunning level of enthusiasm, considering the audience of a hundred or so ranged from lifetime fans, to casual listeners, to a guy who I am convinced had no idea where he was, or how he got there, or why someone had put shrimp on the gourmet hot dogs. At the beginning of the performance, the trio's DJ, Vincent Mason, polled the audiences's age as a warm-up. Who in here is in the late 20s, he asked, their early 30s, late 30s, 40s? With each jump, Mason rolled with laughter, while emphatically tugging his peppery beard. And the older he polled, the louder the club got.       Spotify may target young, but this was an older audience. It wasn't the loudest show I've seen, but thanks to the group's regular encouragement, the concert felt alive, despite most of the club being more interested in enjoying a nice meal than getting close to the stage. The show ended around 9, and most people seemed satisfied with their evening. As musicians try to find alternate models for making bank, I wonder if this is a worthy route: good food, good music, and a good experience, sold at a premium. Would 30-somethings pay $200 a ticket for a custom-designed meal inspired by and enjoyed with their favorite music? As bands age, so do their fans. Older audiences — who have greater income, lower patience, and recurring back pain — want more than a cement floor, overpriced drinks, small bathrooms, and over-amplified audio. I think a smart service would provide as much. Spotify may target young, but this was an older audience I think Spotify thinks so too, in some part. Spotify has an established albeit peculiar relationship with food. It launched Supper.mx last year — which curiously didn't come up during a party with literally the very same name. The site (which resembles a custom Pinterest board) features recipes, often from popular chefs, and pairs them with music on Spotify. Through Supper, the company has presumably built some sort of relationship with these chefs and their restaurants. And it already knows the music business intimately. Yes, my bold idea is for Spotify, a streaming company, to get into the incredibly complex, competitive world of live music. Do it for promotion. Do it for money. Do it for people like me who want to enjoy the music in comfort. I'm sure I sound lame, like a man approaching his 30s that no longer fits in the venues he frequented only a few years ago, but believe me the older music market is real. Need proof?

First, he's going to sell the movie, a comedy called Hits, as a BitTorrent Bundle. This is the first feature film distributed over a Bundle (certainly not over BitTorrent itself...), and it's going to be the first Bundle to use a pay-what-you-want model as well.    Cross wasn't satisfied with what movie distributors were offering Bundles are BitTorrent's way of legitimizing the network it created, allowing artists to take advantage of the way it limits costs for distribution by spreading files out across a large group, while also making people pay for the content that they're downloading. It doesn't always make sense — if a seller can afford to distribute their file through a direct download, that's going to be a much easier experience for most viewers — but it's not totally illogical. In an instance like this, where Cross wants to do pay-what-you-want, he isn't going to be losing money on bandwidth costs for every viewer who doesn't pay. The Bundle for Hits is going to go on sale February 13th.   Even though he's distributing the film online first, Cross still wants to see his film enter theaters. To that end, he's launching a Kickstarter campaign to fund yet another distribution experiment: he wants to do pay-what-you-want sales for movie tickets. He's looking to raise $100,000 so that Hits can make it into at least 50 markets. The money will go toward theater rentals and marketing.   Cross says that both distribution efforts are ""inspired in great part by what Thom Yorke and Radiohead did with BitTorrent, and what Louis C.K. did to redefine how an artist can get their material directly to fans."" Yorke distributed his most recent album over a Bundle, while Louis C.K. has released several recordings online for a low price and with no DRM. Radiohead, famously, popularized the experimental pay-what-you-want model back in 2007 with their album In Rainbows.   There's some difference here in that Cross' movie, which received several bad reviews out of its Sundance premiere, certainly wouldn't have received the type of huge publicity and distribution that a release like In Rainbows would have otherwise been treated to. Nonetheless, he's still going against the grain. It still may take someone of Cross' prominence to successful run an experiment like this, but it will ultimately make it easier for other artists to find success by taking the same route.",0.5924271346072763,0.40757286539272375,0.23440260344090294,451,4.9379157427937912,263,5.832699619771863,0,0,"Culture, Entertainment, Tech",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Blessed with a rare moment of peace found in the chaos of the first 48 hours, I almost missed will.i.am zip by me through the door. A few minutes later a rep for 3D Systems — the company whose event I'm there for — turned to him and said ""I’m going to power you down. I'm going to have to turn you off.""   Okay, so will.i.am wasn't actually there — he was attending the event via a telepresence robot made by Beam. And after some technical difficulties were fixed by rebooting ""Will,"" the celebrity greeted the small crowd. He is there because he is 3D Systems' Chief Creative Officer, the newest high-level (and perhaps questionable) title the Black Eyed Pea has added to his resume over the years.   The event for the 3D printing company itself was typical of many I've experienced here at my first CES with The Verge. There was stuff that was seen last year, like these colorful and sugary 3D-printed candies. There were few announcements, like a dedicated chocolate 3D printer called CocoJet. And there was stuff in between, like an overlooked but significant product from mid-2014 called the Ekocycle Cube. The last one is a compact 3D printer that prints with post-consumer plastic — a cool first step down the road that leads to discarded soda bottles becoming the material your home printer uses to make your kid's toys.   That's the problem with these events — the news of small but meaningful advances gets clouded by the attempts to make them stand out. There was valuable information about what 3D Systems is doing, you just had to look for it. In a darker, less-prepared room on the second floor, creative director Annie Shaw showed off a line of fashion items with open-sourced designs next to an underdressed worker who was manning the audio for the event. Back out on that balcony, 3D Systems' Keith Ozar was explaining how the Ekocycle Cube worked while his colleague Joshua St. John was walking people through the company's Touch haptic stylus — a funny-looking device that's actually quite innovative. It's a pen that, at the tip, is connected to a cylinder by a motorized arm that gives feedback relative to whatever's happening on a screen. You don't write on a surface with it, you write in suspended space and the feedback mimics the contours of what you're working on. It's a solution the company has provided to professional 3D designers and sculptors for a while. The demo game it runs along with Oculus Rift was a repetitive but fun Jenga-style puzzler set on a Mars-like world. You use the pen to ""grab"" the bricks you want to move, and as you do the motors drive force feedback that makes it feel like you're actually touching them. St. John excitedly described other possible applications, some of which have already been developed. One is a program that lets students peer around a 3D archaeological dig and use the pen as a brush. When a bone is successfully unearthed, the student receives a file that can be used to 3D-print their treasure. It's not revolutionary, but it's the kind of thing that could change a classroom experience and add to a school's curriculum. The flashy parts of 3D Systems' event — the chocolate, an ornate 3D-printed cake, and yes, the robot — were in the main room of the suite. It was there that CEO Avi Reichental addressed the press from between the telecelebrity and a ChefJet 3D printer that perturbingly rocked back and forth as it toiled away on another piece of candy. If the suite had been filled with true CES show-goers, these things would make sense.   In 2013, we said will.i.am was ""the most CES celebrity ever,"" and it appears that nothing has changed. Even with celebrities being incongruously handed honorary senior and advisory positions by tech companies left and right, he's still one of the most visible. He's the Director of Creative Innovation for Intel. He created the Puls smartwatch. He is responsible for creating a monstrosity of a phone case called i.am+ foto.soho. And after watching him speak from a script via a robot from a grey-walled room in London, part of me is convinced will.i.am's real job is actually being an outsourced CCO. There he sits, day after day, waiting for companies to call his people to reserve a time so he can beam in and wax futuristic. But there was a moment where he went off script and effused about teaching a child how garbage can be used as raw material to make something new using the Ekocycle Cube. And those devices he created came from a company he started that gets kids involved. He’s not the first promote these things, but he does it just well enough that we will never, ever escape him at CES. And maybe that’s okay. The Ekocycle Cube, made in partnership with Coca-Cola, uses post-consumer plastic as raw material for printing.  The fashion items ranged from ornate jewelry to a dress printed with materials that are used in Formula 1 cars. The designs that were shown were open source, 3D Systems' Creative Director Annie Shaw told me. The goal is that consumers will download the designs to print at home, or even modify them to fit their needs. 3D Systems has collaborated with designer Iris Van Herpen, who gathered inspiration for the collection from a visit to the Large Hadron Collider, according to Shaw. 3D systems announced CocoJet at CES, the result of a partnership with Hershey. The ChefJet, seen here, was announced at last year's CES. A rep helps troubleshoot the issues that delayed the event. Will.I.Am + 3DS (do not beam in unless you are Adam) The future of candy packaging is a USB drive. 3D Systems is offering an SDK for the Touch haptic stylus aimed at digital design and virtual gaming for $599. 3D Systems CEO Avi Reichental, will.i.am, and the CocoJet printer. The entire top of this beetle-shaped cake was printed using 3D printers.  This tart candy was one of our favorite things we saw at last year's CES. They were just as delicious this time around.  All of these candies came out of the 3D printer looking just like this. These are the 3D-printed legs that 3D Systems made for Derby the dog, a pup that was born with deformed front legs. Thanks to these, Derby was able to run for the first time ever. The fins on this surfboard were 3D-printed as well, and they were modeled after the fins of a whale. One of the biggest applications for 3D printing is the creation of drones. Another star was on hand at the event — Justin Bieber. These ping pong paddles were made in his likeness.",0.5858042206508203,0.4141957793491797,0.25433937308862115,1172,4.6552901023890785,597,5.9430485762144052,0,60,"CES 2015, Culture, Entertainment, Photo Essay, Report",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

She's just not giving it that pop, that spark it needs to take off. ""I need you to sing like you are going to die tomorrow,"" Lucious says after the first failed take. The second doesn't hit either, so he enters the booth and asks her to remember her brother's murder: ""How did it feel when you had to go identify his body?"" And the third time's the charm — she nails it. Turning soulful singing into an equation — or an artist's adversity into a marketable product — and repeating it ad infinitum is the secret of Lucious' job. Empire is about the ""music industry,"" a phrase that will always be innately contradictory Empire is about the ""music industry,"" a phrase that will always be innately contradictory. Selling music is a business, one that lends itself to all kinds of dramatic intrigue on series like Nashville, Mozart In The Jungle, and Power. In its pilot, at least, Empire itself emphasizes commerce over art — Lucious' company is called Empire Enterprises, not Empire Records (a name that, admittedly, has already been taken). And it derives most of its dramatic tension from that end of the industry. Rather than focusing on any of the characters' difficulties with artistic inspiration for its own sake, Lucious' business has to remain profitable in a replicable fashion, at least if his plan to save the music industry by taking Empire public is to succeed. That plan requires the ailing mogul (he's been recently diagnosed with ALS) to pick a new figurehead for the company — to determine which of his sons will succeed him. The three sons, all theoretically competitors for leadership of the company, are effectively positioned on a spectrum that posits an inverse relationship between business knowledge and charisma. Andre (Trai Byers), the eldest son, is an immensely intelligent, cold-blooded executive who's clearly the most qualified to run a company but largely expressionless, consigned to scheming with his Lady Macbeth-like wife. He's a representative of the increasingly dominant pure business approach to music, but Empire isn't just a series of calculations — Lucious tells Andre it has to remain a ""celebrity-driven brand,"" which should therefore be run by a celebrity (who will somehow have time to run a publicly traded company while being a public figure). Empire subscribes to a management philosophy that's more Jay Z than Lyor Cohen That personality-fueled approach lends itself to a series as over-the-top in its dramatics as Empire aspires to be, and it subscribes to a management philosophy that's more Jay-Z (on whom Lucious is clearly based) than, say, Lyor Cohen. And it's why his first choice to lead the company is Hakeem (Bryshere Y. Gray), his youngest son, a gifted hip-hop artist (you can tell because he uses the Migos flow at the end of the episode) who has never worked for anything and suffers from an alcohol problem. Hakeen has both the creativity and impulse control of a child, and is reminiscent of some of hip-hop's extremely talented enfant terribles — Chief Keef or Tyler The Creator circa 2010; acts whose ""shocking"" and ""unstable"" antics are part of how we understand their success. Though Keef's legal problems contribute to his image, they'll likely only remain useful so long as he can keep producing hits. Then there's Jamal (Jussie Smollett), the middle son: both a talented, passionate songwriter and reasonably intelligent, put-together human being. But he's seemingly passive and unwilling to take charge of his career, or, as Lucious would have it, overcome his homosexuality. Lucious' is of the opinion that a gay artist — and, apparently, executive — can't sell to the black community or white kids. (Clearly Frank Ocean, on whom Jamal appears to be at least partially based, doesn't exist in the world of Empire.) Lucious is all about mass appeal, building a persona that can satisfy everyone at once. Jamal, meanwhile, is apparently largely successful in Brooklyn and San Francisco — a limited audience, but one indicative of an increasingly diversified pop music landscape where only four albums sell over a million copies. (Though Jamal’s story inevitably seems like it will find him making crossover hits.)   Lucious seems to think that he can identify intense individuality and sell it to the masses — his perspective on the intersection of art and commerce. When Hakeem lays down a track Jamal helped him write, Lucious is impressed, but downplays Jamal's contributions. He attributes success to ""that monster in you, that genius."" And in its pilot, Empire would seem to confirm Lucious' theory that the right people — the ones possessed by that monster — are paid for their emotional labor in artistic talent, or at least business success. Clearly Frank Ocean doesn't exist in the world of Empire At the heart of this is Lucious' own dark back story: we learn that he murdered several people early in his pre-record-industry criminal career, and his ex-wife Cookie (a stellar Taraji P. Henson), served a 30-year sentence after covering up for his involvement in the drug trade. In a way this is yet another retelling of the dominant narrative of the Successful Rapper. Jay Z's origin story has been told so many times it's now functionally a series of tropes for him to reference on phoned-in guest verses. Get Rich Or Die Tryin' is literally a movie dramatizing 50 Cent's beginnings. And Rick Ross built his career upon a completely fictionalized variation on this myth. In practice, Lucious' approach — personal drama as a pre-requisite for becoming a star — is disastrous. As he suggests to his board, the music business has changed, from the model where one is rewarded for having a strong will and a difficult life, because of the internet. Because of illegal downloading, he says, it's now ""impossible for disenfranchised kids growing up in the projects to overcome poverty the way that I did."" He believes he can change this by taking the company public, and maintaining the same model for exchange between humanity (as art) and money. This is a deeply conservative myth (not to mention one that's afraid of the internet to a Sorkinesque degree) premised in the ability of Lucious and others like him to pull themselves up by their bootstraps. The full picture here makes sense, but there's rot at the base. Empire often looks like a relic from 2006 The biggest threat to Lucious' empire comes from Cookie, who notes that he was only able to obtain his wealth with an initial investment from criminal activity — something which has become just as much a part of that myth of his success. Lucious and Cookie's implication that those crimes were justified by his later success makes the entirety of Empire Enterprises a house of cards — one that demands a dark, soapy secret at the heart of substantial wealth. And it leaves Empire looking a bit like a relic from 2006. There are certainly real-life artists in 2015 who one can easily manage being signed to Empire — Pusha T, YG, even Kendrick Lamar (whose Good Kid, M.A.A.d City is sort of an album-length version of this sort of narrative) — but there's more than enough diversity in the hip-hop landscape to support different approaches to making and selling music. The sort of niches Lucious rejects have been filled by everyone from Chance The Rapper to Swedish internet sensation Yung Lean. And that's not even including people who could have been birthed fully-formed from Andre's account book (Flo Rida, Big Sean, and, of course, Iggy Azalea). Lucious' view of what it takes for someone to succeed in hip-hop is dangerously narrow-minded, and reinforces unfortunate ideas about what kids should ""have to"" do to become artists. Let's hope Empire acknowledges his limitations as it builds.",0.6269299156190976,0.3730700843809024,0.834569445001276,1346,4.9910846953937593,705,6.3446808510638295,0,2,"Culture, Entertainment, Review",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

The fitness trackers, like a Fitbit or a Jawbone, and the smartwatches, like Android Wear and the Apple Watch. The common thinking has been that these two camps will soon converge, and there’s been a lot of evidence that such a future is not far off. Fitness tracking is a big component of the Apple Watch and a number of Android Wear devices, and Fitbit’s latest models have a lot of smartwatch capabilities to augment their fitness tracking.Yet while many smartwatches have fitness tracking and many fitness trackers have smartwatch features, both options demand compromises. You either choose between great fitness-tracking features or smartwatch productivity. Alcatel’s new Onetouch Watch, a $149.99 wrist-worn wearable shipping this month, is just the latest device trying to be both. After wearing the Onetouch Watch for the past week, I’ve found that it’s not a great smartwatch, nor is it a great fitness tracker. Instead, it asks a different compromise: are you willing to give up the best in either category for something that’s cheaper than most smartwatches and better looking than most fitness trackers?   At first glance, the Onetouch Watch belongs in the smartwatch camp. With its round face, metal body, and color display, it’s easy to compare it to Motorola’s Moto 360. But while the Moto 360 is a full Android Wear-powered smartwatch, the Onetouch Watch runs on a proprietary platform that works with both Android and iOS devices. Aside from the cross-platform benefit, the Onetouch Watch is slimmer, cheaper, and lasts longer between charges than most other smartwatches. Aesthetically, the Onetouch Watch is considerably nicer than many other wearables, especially in this price range. It’s round, much like a traditional watch, isn’t as thick as most Android Wear devices, and has a design that can work with a wide variety of outfits or personal styles. It doesn’t look like a computer on my wrist nor does it attempt to make a fashion statement like the Apple Watch — to most people, I’m just wearing a generic digital watch. At the center of the round face is a 1.22-inch color touchscreen with 240 x 204 pixel resolution. It’s not a full circle — there’s a flat area at the bottom just like on the Moto 360 — and you can certainly see pixels, but it’s bright and vibrant with great viewing angles. It’s easily visible outdoors, which isn’t something I can say for a lot of smartwatches with color screens. Most of the time the Watch’s display is off — you wake it up by pressing the button on the side or raising your arm as if to check the time. The gesture actually works with less lag than I expected, but I still prefer a watch that lets me check the time without moving my arm. The Onetouch Watch has a fixed rubber strap that’s flexible and comfortable to wear all day. It comes in two colors — white or black  — but it isn’t interchangeable, so you’re stuck with whichever one you pick from the outset. The fixed band does have a couple of key advantages: there’s an NFC chip inside the band for quick pairing and a built-in USB plug for charging. The USB plug at the end of the strap might be the smartest part of the Watch’s design: you can plug into any USB port to recharge the watch, no clumsy adapters needed.   Tapping the screen launches a basic grid for the various built-in apps on the Watch. There’s a simple weather app, compass, music controller, phone locator, and an app to remotely take pictures with your phone’s camera. There’s also the fitness-tracking apps, which can count steps, track distance traveled, track your sleep, and measure your heart rate. There are three basic watch face designs (two analog, one digital), and you can customize the colors and background of the watch face. You access notifications by swiping up from the bottom of the screen, which is a bit clumsy and not too easy to do when you’re on the go. The flat area at the bottom of the display also acts as a back button to navigate through the hierarchy of the interface. Notifications on the Onetouch Watch are where its smartwatch leanings start to fall apart. Like any other smartwatch, it’s convenient to get buzzes on your wrist when something or someone is trying to get your attention. But the Watch’s display does not light up automatically when notifications come in, nor does the notification drawer pop up by itself, requiring me to touch the watch with my other hand to see what just made it buzz. The Watch only lets me read the notification — there’s no clearing it or acting upon it from my wrist. Further, the Watch only supports notifications from select apps (calls, messages, email, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Facebook Messenger, Google+, Google Hangouts, and Gmail), so there was no way to configure it to see alerts from my email app of choice (Outlook) or get alerts from Google Now. Alcatel tells me that it will add support for more app notifications in the future, but it will be relying on feedback from users for what apps to add. The other smartwatch things you might look for — third-party apps, custom watch faces, and voice control — aren’t available on the Onetouch Watch. With its limited support for notifications and lack of these extra features, it’s better to think of this as a fitness device with some smartwatch features rather than a smartwatch with fitness features.   So how does it fare as a fitness device? Fine enough for what it is, but what it is turns out to be pretty limited. I’ll start with the good parts. The companion app for iOS and Android lets you view your activity and set goals with an informative and attractive dashboard. Thankfully, the Watch’s step counting isn’t as wildly inaccurate as other trackers I’ve worn. The  heart rate monitoring may be slow, but it’s consistent and about as accurate as any other wrist-worn monitor I’ve tried. I could easily see someone choosing to wear the Onetouch Watch just because it’s a decent-looking device that counts their steps. (This is also the entire appeal of the Withings Activité line.) Yet as much as I like the fitness tracking, there’s a lot of room for improvement. I can set my goals and see charts of my activity in the companion app, but unless I’m consciously checking my progress throughout the day, the watch doesn’t actively encourage me to get up and work toward hitting my goals. The data captured by the watch doesn’t sync with Apple’s Health app, Google’s Fit platform, or any other service, trapping it within Alcatel’s system. That’s actually a huge disappointment, because most fitness trackers at this price give you the added benefit of participating in some kind of ecosystem. Either you can compare your scores with friends or at least get plugged into either Android or Apple’s built-in system for fitness. There’s also a sleep-tracking system on Alcatel’s watch, but it’s not automatic, so I need to start it each night and stop it when I wake up. So why would you want to accept all these limitations? Well, for one, you might just like the traditional, no-nonsense look of the watch. For another, the Onetouch Watch outlasts all other smartwatches with color displays when it comes to battery life. I’ve been able to get a full two days between charges with it, and even more if I take it off at night and forget about the (questionably useful) sleep tracking. Combine that with the super convenient built-in USB port on the strap, and the Watch is one of the least annoying wearables you can buy when it comes to battery life and charging.   The Onetouch Watch embodies the split between smartwatches and fitness trackers, and it’s emblematic of what is about to be a deluge of also-ran wearables. It’s a fitness tracker posing as a smartwatch, but it doesn’t do as well as the best options in either category. If you want a fitness tracker that looks more like a traditional watch than a sport band, the Onetouch Watch is more appealing than a Fitbit or a Jawbone. It’s attractive, lasts long enough between charges, has reliable and accurate step and activity tracking, and is less expensive than similarly equipped devices. The downside is that your data is trapped inside Alcatel’s ecosystem instead of a more open or useful platform. But as a smartwatch, the Onetouch Watch leaves a lot to be desired, especially when it comes to useful notifications on your wrist. It also doesn’t have the expandability of Pebble, Apple Watch, or Android Wear through third-party apps. The Onetouch Watch is cheap, and it looks good, but that’s where its appeal ends as a smartwatch. It’s an in-between wearable device that doesn’t have the platform support of Apple or Google, nor the fitness tracking chops of Fitbit, Jawbone, and the like. You’re going to see a lot of devices like this on the shelves at Best Buy, because it turns out that making a basic smartwatch and making a basic fitness tracker is getting to be pretty easy. But making something that does both well? That’s really hard.",0.6380977195822848,0.3619022804177152,0.17401000187259733,1576,4.8464467005076139,633,6.2195892575039498,0,12,"Mobile, Tech, Review",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Biometric sensors like the fingerprint scanner are one option, but some students and researchers from UC Berkeley are taking a more mental than physical approach to security. Using an off-the-shelf, consumer-oriented headset with a built-in electroencephalogram (EEG), the team developed a way for users to log in and authenticate their identities using only their brain waves. The impetus for this project came from the availability of low-cost EEG sensors — while researchers have long proposed using EEGs to authenticate users with ""passthoughts,"" previous hardware was both expensive and invasive. However, the UC Berkeley team was able to use the Neurosky Mindset, a $199 dollar headset that looks like a standard pair of bluetooth headphones with a single EEG probe attached to it. The question was then whether or not that single sensor would provide enough of a quality brainwave signal to effectively authenticate users. After selecting customized thought-tasks for each user and calibrating the headset for each user's ""authentication threshold,"" the system returned error rates of less than one percent. Another blow struck against the venerable but aging password The last hurdle involved determining what specific mental tasks would be best-suited to this type of authentication — the team wanted the interaction to be as user-friendly as possible. To find the most suitable tasks, the team measured the brainwaves of test subjects performing seven different mental activities to authenticate their identify. Research showed that the best tasks for this setup were ones that users didn't mind repeating on a daily basis — the tasks need to be easy, but not too boring. Imagining singing a song or counting objects of a specific color worked well, while more mundane tasks like imagining sliding your finger were too boring. Users also didn't want to choose their own task — they ended up choosing something too complicated or difficult to repeat. While EEG hardware will need to become more commonplace before such an authentication system can be widely implemented, the simplicity and low cost of newer sensors means this system might have a shot.",0.33284751416455044,0.6671524858354496,0.31572654506461406,377,5.3607427055702921,238,6.3193277310924367,0,0,Science,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

These waves are obviously no longer audible, but it's possible to simulate them: NASA probes collect information on cosmic background radiation, which was shaped by the sound so that some areas still remain hotter or colder. In 2003, Professor Emeritus John Cramer mapped those variations into a sound file, producing a widely-heard 100-second ""recording"" of the Big Bang. Ten years later, he's back with another ""high fidelity"" version.  Cramer based his 2003 interpretation of the Big Bang's sound on data from NASA's Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP). This time, though, he opted for the European Space Agency's Planck mission, which recently released a new and more precise map of cosmic microwaves. That map can be seen above; ESA scientists have pointed to several small anomalies that could require us to rethink how the universe developed. The new sound file is based on temperature fluctuations mapped on an ESA graph; after manually recording each of the data points, Cramer created a monaural sound wave following the frequency spectrum, then adjusted it to account for how the sound would have changed as the universe stretched, ""becoming more of a 'bass instrument.'"" As a last step, he scaled it upwards to create a sound that could be heard by the human ear.

A team of chemical engineers and neuroscientists at Stanford University collaborated on the new federally-funded technique, known as CLARITY, which was described today in the journal Nature. Experts involved in the project suggest it will play a pivotal role in the government's recently announced BRAIN project, a blockbuster venture that hopes to map the mind, much as scientists over the last decade mapped the human genome. The hope is to understand processes like memory formation and learning, and treat ailments like Alzheimer's disease and epilepsy. ""This is huge."" ""I can't make any official statement, but I can say that this is exactly the type of technology one would hope to develop for the [BRAIN] project,"" Michelle Freund, Ph.D., a program manager with the National Institutes of Mental Health who oversaw the CLARITY research, told The Verge. ""This is huge."" Right now, researchers conducting analyses of post-mortem brain samples struggle to obtain much in the way of useful information. That's because they're thwarted by lipids, fatty molecules that help the brain maintain its structure — but also prevent chemicals or light from permeating grey matter, barring researchers from getting a closer look at the brain's molecular workings. To circumvent that challenge, researchers slice the brain into thin layers. Unfortunately, that tactic prevents them from understanding how ""big picture"" brain components, like neural circuits, are impacted by, say, the millions of neurons that interact to control these larger processes.    ""Studying intact systems with this sort of molecular resolution and scope — to be able to see the fine detail and the big picture at the same time — has been a major unmet goal of biology,"" research leader Karl Deisseroth, M.D., Ph.D., said. ""[It's] a goal that CLARITY begins to address."" Dr. Deisseroth, notably, is one of 15 scientists on a federal working group tasked with establishing priorities for the federal BRAIN venture. The result? A fully transparent brain Dr. Deisseroth and his colleagues accomplished what, until now, remained an impossible task: they managed to remove the brain's lipids without destroying the structure of the grey matter itself. To do it, the team infused a brain with a clear gel solution that expanded into a mesh supporting the brain tissue. That process complete, researchers were able to extract the brain's lipids without compromising structural integrity. The result? A fully transparent brain whose components remained available for analysis. Already, the team has tested the method on a full mouse brain and on samples of human brain tissue. In the mouse brain, they were able to see complex circuitry that winds through the brain, as well as probe into finer details, like the structure of a single cell. Plus, any brain that undergoes the CLARITY process can be examined over and over: tracer molecules, used to stain specific brain components for analysis, can be flushed out without disturbing delicate tissue. ""You could conceivably label and follow 10 or 12 different neurotransmitters in a single brain,"" Freund said. ""With earlier methods, that just wasn't possible — you stained once, that slice of tissue was done."" The implications of the method are myriad. For one, researchers can use the technique for post-mortem study of individuals afflicted with various brain-based illnesses, to better understand how those ailments manifest in grey matter and help determine how we might treat or prevent them. The project is also partly funded by military agency DARPA's Repair program, which endeavors to come up with better treatments for traumatic brain injuries — a problem afflicting both soldiers and athletes, namely NFL players, in devastating numbers. ""Issues with data risk being a bottleneck for the uptake of this technology."" But before the approach can become a mainstay of neuroscientific study, researchers will need to clear one major hurdle: how to handle the huge reams of data that'll emerge from collecting information on these billions of cells, and their complex interactions, that have suddenly become readily accessible for study. ""Issues with data risk being a bottleneck for the uptake of this technology,"" Freund said, adding that several federal agencies and programs (including the BRAIN project) will work to tackle that challenge, though they've yet to announce specific strategies. ""This project is a perfect example of why better ways to handle large quantities of data should be a top priority.""",0.8856716923341168,0.1143283076658832,0.5196351734856147,773,5.3130659767141006,435,6.4850574712643674,0,0,"Science, Report",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It's completely voluntarily and up to state boards of education to decide which if any of the new standards they want to adopt.

In fact, your own body might be one of the first places these devices are deployed.    ""Electronics that disappear in a way that's programmable and controlled."" ""The goal of the electronics industry has always been to build durable devices that last forever and perform consistently,"" John Rogers, Ph.D., a materials scientist at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, told The Verge. ""But imagine the possibilities once you start thinking about electronics that disappear in a way that's programmable and controlled."" Rogers is leading a team of materials scientists and biomedical engineers from across the country in the development of such gadgets. One day they may transform the consumer electronics industry. But researchers are currently more interested in the devices' potential for medical care, like implantable sensors or drug dispensers, as well as military exploits and environmental monitoring. Research into such devices has made rapid progress, meaning that preliminary versions of vanishing electronics might be available within the next few years. In a presentation at the annual conference of the American Chemical Society, Rogers shared tantalizing details of new progress in transient electronic development, including successful tests on animal subjects and wireless power systems integrated into the devices, offering energy without relying on an external electricity source. ""We're coming along quickly,"" he said. ""I don't want to give a specific timetable, but I can say that we're already a long way from where we were even a few months ago."" Rogers first started investigating transient electronics in 2008, and worked with a grant from military research agency DARPA to develop preliminary iterations of the devices. In September of last year, he and a consortium of researchers published a paper in Science outlining several key breakthroughs, most notably the development of integrated circuit boards capable of dissolving in water or bodily fluid at a controlled rate of degradation. Rogers and colleagues had to re-imagine every single component of an electronic To come up with the devices in the first place, Rogers and colleagues had to re-imagine every single component of an electronic gadget, from semiconductors to power supply systems, in order to flip the standards of conventional electronics — durability and long lifespan — on their heads. The devices rely on an eclectic combination of biocompatible materials: silicon, already an industry standard in conventional integrated circuits, is spliced into ultra-thin dissolvable layers; magnesium acts as a conductor; and layers of magnesium oxide and silk encase the entire device. The lifespan of a given gadget will depend on how thick that outer layer is, but could theoretically range from hours to years. Rogers and his team have now successfully implanted one type of transient device into a mouse, where the implant killed off bacteria around a surgical wound site — a process that typically relies on antibiotics — before dissolving. Where medical care is concerned, different iterations of the devices would circumvent existing challenges that hamper existing implantable electronics, namely concerns over long-term effects inside the body, as well as painful or costly implant removal and replacement. ""That's a pretty game-changing application."" They've also devised two different systems to fuel the devices: a wireless power system that converts radio frequency energy into DC power, and another that harvests power through movement. Rogers anticipates the latter being particularly helpful inside the human body. ""Imagine you insert something into the heart, the heart is beating, and you're able to generate energy from that movement,"" he said. ""That's a pretty game-changing application."" The military is also taking note of that game-changing potential. DARPA earlier this year solicited research proposals for a new program, called Vanishing Programmable Resources (VAPR), that aims to devise transient electronics for national defense. Rogers, whose team applied for funding through the initiative, declined to specify what those applications might be. The DARPA program announcement, however, mentions a desire for ""remote sensing and communications devices"" that don't need to be collected once they've completed a task — suggesting that surveillance is a top priority. Rogers and his team, it's worth noting, have already designed a transient, 64-pixel digital camera. ""With regards to the military, I'm not at liberty to tell you what the most important applications might be,"" Rogers noted. ""But I'm sure you can imagine.""",0.7502370468032671,0.24976295319673292,0.8053542083122608,764,5.6164921465968582,437,6.7254004576659039,0,0,"Science, Report",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The Ponce is a transport vessel from the 1970s that was recently upgraded into a hi-tech floating base and is stationed in the Persian Gulf, in range of Iranian attack boats.  As evidence of how far it's come with laser technology, the Navy released videos and imagery today of its prototype cannon tracking and burning a small drone out of the sky. The test firing took place off the coast of California in July last year, an ONR spokesperson told The Verge. It followed on the heels of a previous test of the Navy's laser weapons in early 2011, when a laser cannon was used to ignite and destroy a small boat.   ""a major show of confidence"" in the technology Putting such a weapon out into the field aboard the Ponce, however, is ""a major show of confidence"" in the technology, as Danger Room's Spencer Ackerman wrote last month. That's especially true given the fact that defense spending is likely to face cuts in the upcoming federal budget. Still, the Navy thinks the technology is worth further investment in and may actually be cheaper than other current defense weapons. ""Compared to existing ship self-defense systems, such as missiles and guns,"" a Navy specialist wrote in a report to Congress last month, ""lasers could provide Navy surface ships with a more cost effective means of countering certain surface, air, and ballistic missile targets."" The latest test is further evidence that the Navy is setting its laser ambitions higher than you may have guessed.",0.48178622853344044,0.5182137714665596,0.6572826807628244,313,4.7380191693290739,189,5.6719576719576716,0,0,Science,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

We've reached out to Intuitive Surgical for comment. As the increasing use of robotic surgical systems brings about more opportunities for a glitch to surface, Carnegie Mellon and Johns Hopkins researchers have begun developing ways to prove that a robot is free of errors.

The researchers have developed a new time-of-flight (ToF) 3D camera system that can capture laser pulses from so-called ""uncooperative"" objects — objects made of up surfaces that don't properly reflect laser light, like fabrics. The new system sweeps a low-power infrared laser rapidly across an object and then records the pixel-by-pixel time between when the beam leaves the camera and returns after bouncing off the object in question. The other big improvement to this scanner is its range — according to the researchers, images precise to the millimeter can be shot from up to one kilometer (or just a bit over a half-mile) away. Eventully, the team hopes that the camera's range will extend ten times as far.  The primary planned usage for this scanner is stationary human-made objects, and it's particularly good at scanning images behind a cluttered foreground (such as foliage). However, the one major flaw in the scanner's design is that it can't render human faces properly — in the test images, faces are distorted and disfigured because human skin doesn't reflect enough of the infrared beams to give a proper depth measurement, while a mannequin's face was scanned far more accurately. That's probably a relief for those concerned with the increasing lack of privacy city-dwellers often deal with.

Bloomberg has unearthed a February bill from Kansas' House Committee on Energy and Environment that would outlaw using public funds to promote, support, or plan for ""sustainable development."" What do they mean by that? The bill says it's aimed at ""a mode of human development in which resource use aims to meet human needs while preserving the environment so that these needs can be met not only in the present, but also for generations to come."" The bill is using a standard definition of sustainability — and one that's espoused by the UN, a frequent target of American ire. But its bluntness makes it clear that this isn't just about avoiding unintended consequences from environmentalism: it's taking aim at the essential idea of preserving natural resources for future generations. The one thing it doesn't apply to is conservationism, or attempts to preserve specific sites from destruction; presumably, future Kansans will experience the nature-filled past in special preserves while surviving on resources mined from asteroids. ""Sustainable development and its association with a range of activities is something that needs to be scrutinized."" The Committee on Energy and Environment is headed by Dennis Hedke, a consulting geophysicist who The Topeka Capital-Journal says has worked for dozens of regional oil and gas companies. Hedke has said he brought the bill on behalf of several constituents, but he's suggested in an interview with Bloomberg that it's more a preventative measure than a real response to anything: ""we don’t have laws in Kansas right now that relate to sustainable development."" It's also meant to raise a debate about the practices. ""The idea of sustainable development and its association with a range of activities is something that needs to be scrutinized in the public domain."" State legislatures are no stranger to bizarre or extreme proposals, and Hedke's bill hadn't been heard by the time Kansas' most recent legislative session ended, though it may be revived in the future. As such, it's unlikely citizens will see a ban on sustainability any time soon. But even as plenty of politicians dispute the idea that human activity is causing climate change or that environmental preservation is a good thing, it's unusual to see such opposition spelled out so plainly.",0.5611943711449535,0.4388056288550465,0.2534396168170969,402,5.2736318407960203,244,6.3360655737704921,0,0,"Policy & Law, Science",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

We've graded the big changes below, comparing them to the reforms that were recommended by an independent review panel last year. All in all, the proposed changes mainly concern the NSA's bulk collection of Americans' phone records, not its spying on internet communications. Even accounting for that limitation, they seem good on paper — and far better than many privacy advocates feared — but we're still waiting to see how they will be enacted.  Our scoring takes into account the fact that Obama can’t single-handedly execute the reforms that the panel recommends; in several cases, Congress will need to pass legal reforms, and in others, departments themselves will need to develop and make changes under his direction. For purposes of grading, we’re also assuming some level of good faith: if a resolution is so broad as to be meaningless, it will affect the score, but guidelines that don’t come with a specific policy directive can still be graded well. Keep in mind that this categorically isn’t an evaluation of what’s going to happen, just what we’re being promised today -- for whatever that’s worth. This isn’t a wish list of how the program will ideally be reformed, but it’s holding Obama to the recommendations his panel made. The White House has promised to ""end the program as it currently exists,"" moving phone records out of the government’s direct control. What that is remains to be seen: Obama is asking the intelligence community, including the attorney general and the NSA, to come back in March with alternative ideas. The review panel recommended either asking phone companies to hold information or putting it in the hands of a private third party, both of which pose their own privacy concerns but would mark a step away from centralized collection. Obama also made direct changes to the program as it exists today, though. From now on, analysts can only query records with approval from the FISA court, and they can only search within two ""hops"" or degrees from the target number, rather than three. Instead of collecting phone records in a central database, leave it in the hands of phone companies or another private third party Each piece of information the NSA collects must be relevant to a national security investigation As a general rule, ""the government should not be permitted to collect and store all mass, undigested, non-public personal information."" National security letters – the secret government orders that compel companies like Google and Facebook to turn over user information to the FBI, without telling the users' themselves – don’t appear to be getting that much added oversight. The president said in his speech that he had directed Attorney General Eric Holder to ""amend"" the secrecy surrounding the letters so that the users who were targeted by them could be told and that tech companies could share more information with the public about the letters they received. But the scope of the letters isn't being narrowed. None of this is precisely a surprise; the FBI pushed hard to maintain NSLs’ ease of use, promising that last decade’s rampant abuse has been curbed and that the letters are a vital national security tool. We are, however, seeing significant reforms to the accompanying gag orders: Letters should have to go through a court instead of being managed almost purely by the FBI NSLs must be ""reasonable in focus, scope, and breadth,"" subject to the same limits on keeping and distributing information as the court-managed Section 215 law Unless a court says it would pose a significant risk, recipients shouldn’t be banned from talking about an NSL; if they are, the order should expire within 180 days unless renewed The president mostly defended the NSA's sweeping collection of ordinary citizens' emails at home and abroad, saying ""the men and women of the intelligence community, including the NSA, consistently follow protocols designed to protect the privacy of ordinary people. They are not abusing authorities in order to listen to your private phone calls, or read your emails."" Obama acknowledged ""mistakes"" had been made, but said they were quickly corrected. He pointed out that even intelligence workers ""have kids on Facebook and Instagram,"" and so were not inclined to abuse their authority. It seems like this program will remain mostly unchanged for now. If any information about a US citizen is collected under a law for non-American surveillance, it should be purged immediately unless it has foreign intelligence value If data from a US person is kept, it shouldn’t be used as evidence in any case against them, and the government can’t specifically search for communications involving a particular US person Non-US persons should only be surveilled for national security, and the US should make clear that it’s not targeting people for political or religious beliefs and is monitoring the program as closely as possible Much of this work will have to be done by Congress, but the president made a strong commitment to many of the crucial FISA reforms, including the new position of Public Interest Advocate, which also now includes an unexpected technical component. The president also made gestures towards annual declassification reviews, a crucial but delicate transparency measure where the details of implimentation will be particularly important to watch. There was little word about the wonky details of how FISA judges are confirmed, but the larger push for FISA reform suggests those changes have a good chance of coming through. This post would be a citizen’s advocate, arguing against the NSA’s surveillance demands. Before now, the court’s rulings have been secret by default. The new procedure would tie FISA judges to the Supreme Court, separating the court further from the executive branch. This is a serious point of disagreement between Obama and the review panel, although it's not necessarily a bad one. The review panel's oversight mechanisms are all focused in the executive branch, adding new presidentially appointed offices and stronger oversight from the presidential staff. Obama's directives ignore that entirely, favoring oversight from the judicial branch. In many ways it's a better solution, offering a stronger check on from a separate branch of government. It's also a challenge the judiciary is better equipped to handle in many ways. Still the judges in question are unlikely to be as sensitive to public opinion as the proposed Sensitive Activities Office. There were a few nods towards more review from department heads, but anyone hoping for strong oversight from civilian agencies is coming away empty-handed. The independent office would monitor classified collection activities, and object when they seem inappropriately broad. This would give the president more of a say in the tools the NSA uses, and what it uses them for. For the cryptography geeks and civil liberties advocates, this was the main event, proof that the US government was undermining the essential tools of online privacy. Unfortunately, Obama hasn't touched this yet, possibly betting that most Americans care more about their phones than their HTTPS layer. The president also hasn't made any moves to separate the NSA from the US Cyber Command, or touched the NSA's status as the government's codemaker general. Anyone waiting for a sweeping affirmation of the sanctity of encryption would be advised not to hold their breath. After inserting its own backdoors, the NSA has no credibility as an encryption authority. New efforts are needed to regain the world’s trust in American IT products. Right now, the NSA retains encrypted communications automatically, holding them as suspicious by default. This was one of the most damaging leaks, and while most of the backpedaling has happened on the diplomatic stage, it’s been a key example of NSA power run amok. Spying on Angela Merkel was a key example where diplomatic risk outweighed the benefits of the information involved. In today’s speech, the president explicitly said he had instructed intelligence agencies to refrain from surveilling friendly heads of state, and while there’s no specific program to stop it from happening again, the president has asked Secretary of State John Kerry to appoint a new official, a ""Coordinator for International Diplomacy,"" to handle complaints and questions about international surveillance from foreign leaders and dignitaries. It’s likely the President didn’t even know the NSA was tapping the German chancellor’s phone. New reforms would require explicit approval before other world leaders could be surveilled. In sum, President Obama’s new reforms offer some hope, but little change. If, as the President suggested, the most controversial program was the collection of phone records, then today’s news is reassuring. The collection of bulk phone records is on the cusp of real and lasting reforms, far beyond the illusory reforms many were predicting. But for those who were more concerned with the NSA reading emails or monitoring web browsing, the president offered surprisingly little. Neither the speech nor the directive addressed PRISM or the tapping of private company networks at Google and Yahoo. Long-standing issues like national security letters received some instructions for future reform, but only after a process of negotiation with the FBI and with no assurance that they would see greater oversight. The NSA will continue its quiet war against encryption tools. Even the promised progress is only a first step, a seed of reform which could easily perish in a hostile legislature or an unresponsive bureaucracy. The next test will come when intelligence agencies respond to the proposals, and Congress moves forward with existing bills for FISA reform.",0.6204554023599778,0.37954459764002224,0.8190307483789478,1622,5.2817509247842169,782,6.671355498721228,2,0,,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

He reminded us that as technology advances, we continue to face new and evolving threats to our national security and must adjust our policies and practices to ensure that our intelligence activities are both necessary and appropriate. In the coming weeks, we will work with our oversight committees to implement the President’s reforms while we continue to focus on the intelligence challenges facing the United States and our allies. As the President said, the men and women of the Intelligence Community perform extraordinarily difficult jobs, in which success is rarely celebrated but is vital to our national security. We conduct the lawful foreign intelligence activities that have been instrumental in preventing a multitude of attacks and saved scores of innocent lives – not just here in the United States, but around the globe. I am extremely proud of how our workforce, especially the National Security Agency, has persevered, and I have assured the President that as we embrace the reforms announced today, we will continue – as we always have – to do our part to keep the nation safe.  Statement by Senator Dianne Feinstein and Representative Mike Rogers: Today President Obama gave a strong speech in defense of the need to collect and use intelligence in order to protect the nation and to prevent terrorist attacks around the world. We strongly agree with his comments in support and praise of the professionals in our intelligence community who do this work while upholding the civil liberties and privacy rights of all Americans. We are also pleased the president underscored the importance of using telephone metadata to rapidly identify possible terrorist plots, a gap that existed on September 11, 2001, and which has been closed through the NSA’s collection of telephone metadata under Section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act. As the president said, this is a capability that is ‘critical’ and must be ‘preserved.’ We have carefully reviewed this program and have found it to be legal and effective. And for seven months, both the House and Senate intelligence committees have developed legislation to provide additional safeguards on the program, while keeping the data where it is most secure and effective. The president announced his intent to seek approvals from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court prior to querying the Section 215 database. If instituted, that approval process must be made faster in the future than it was in the past—when it took up to nine days to gain Court approval for a single search. We encourage the White House to send legislation with the president’s proposed changes to Congress so they can be fully debated. President Obama said today that U.S. intelligence programs have ‘made us more secure’ and that nothing indicates that our intelligence community ‘has sought to violate the law or is cavalier about the civil liberties of their fellow citizens.’ We agree and look forward to working with the president to increase confidence in these programs.",0.8931600791721224,0.10683992082787763,0.8029661684585211,819,5.4041514041514045,393,6.5394402035623411,0,0,US & World,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

A digital rights issue that divides states and courts The Court will review two cases on the subject of warrantless search, and each case differs crucially on whether the Fourth Amendment permits police to search phones. The first, United States v. Wurie, concerns the arrest of Brima Wurie after a suspected drug deal in 2007. South Boston cops confiscated Wurie's phone after a drug deal, and, after rifling through his call logs, were able to locate a massive cache of crack cocaine, marijuana, and weapons at one of Wurie's residences. However, the First US Circuit Court of Appeals threw out the evidence, maintaining that search as part of an arrest does not authorize the search of data on a suspect's cell phone. The Obama administration is currently appealing the verdict, arguing that a warrant should not be necessary. The second case, Riley v. California, concerns suspected gang member David Leon Riley and his involvement in the shooting of a rival gang member in August 2009. In addition to ballistics analysis that linked Riley to the drive-by shooting, law enforcement leaned heavily on evidence gathered from Riley's phone that suggested he was a involved in the San Diego's Lincoln Park Gang. Riley was sentenced to 15 years in prison. Organizations like the EFF have called for the practice to be struck down Supreme Court's decision will serve as a mandate for circuit courts and states that are currently divided on the issue. Presently, the Fourth, Fifth, and Seventh US Circuit Courts, along with the supreme courts of Georgia, California, and Massachusetts, allow for cellphone search without a warrant. The practice has been ruled illegal by the First Circuit and the supreme courts of Florida and Ohio. Meanwhile, organizations like the EFF and Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) have released statements calling for a ruling that strikes down the practice, especially with regard to Riley v California. According to the EPIC website, ""EPIC has an interest in ensuring that the vast amount of personal data contained in individuals' cellphones is not searched and stored by the government without prior judicial authorization and oversight.""

The group's members included Paul Revere, and at night they would patrol the streets, reporting back any signs that the British were preparing raids against America's early Patriots. Ironically, if the British crown had the same surveillance powers in 1775 that the United States does today, Paul Revere would probably have been languishing in a prison cell instead of making his midnight ride. In June, Duke University sociology professor Kieran Healy cleverly explained how metadata alone could have led to Revere's arrest. Simply by mapping out the relationships between known members of seven different Boston social clubs that existed at the time, you find Paul Revere at the center.  Here's a close-up:  While this only proves that Revere was a highly connected individual, a bridge between various social circles, that would have made him a person of interest at the very least, and all the crown needed was a little bit of metadata to know precisely who to target for a deeper investigation. With today's technology and bulk data collection, computers could be programmed to highlight such individuals automatically, so it's not hard to imagine why critics aren't satisfied that the US government doesn't actually listen to telephone calls or read the contents of email.

The court invited the commission to act, and I intend to accept that invitation. Using our authority, we will readdress the concepts in the Open Internet Order as the court invited to encourage growth and innovation and enforce against abuse. We've noted with great interest the expressions from many internet service providers to the effect that they will continue to honor the Open Internet Order's concepts even though they may have been remanded to the commission. That's the right and responsible thing to do, and we take them up on their commitment. At the same time, we accept the court's invitation to revisit the structure of the rules that it vacated.

Judge Tatel struck down the FCC's rules against blocking or discriminating against content, saying that the agency was trying to enforce a policy that couldn't apply to ISPs. But he agreed that the FCC did have some authority to regulate carriers under the rules it was using — Section 706 — even if that authority didn't go as far as it wanted. The framework that we think of as net neutrality, though, may require the politically risky move of actually reclassifying broadband internet as a telecommunications carrier. Will Wheeler be pursuing this? According to a senior capital hill staffer, his office has indicated it will move forward with the authority granted by the court under Section 706 instead of immediately attempting reclassification.

You can read our analysis of Obama's proposed reforms at this link. Remarks of President Barack Obama Results of our Signals Intelligence Review January 17, 2014 Washington, D.C. At the dawn of our Republic, a small, secret surveillance committee borne out of the ""The Sons of Liberty"" was established in Boston. The group's members included Paul Revere, and at night they would patrol the streets, reporting back any signs that the British were preparing raids against America's early Patriots. Throughout American history, intelligence has helped secure our country and our freedoms. In the Civil War, Union balloon reconnaissance tracked the size of Confederate armies by counting the number of camp fires. In World War II, code-breaking gave us insight into Japanese war plans, and when Patton marched across Europe, intercepted communications helped save the lives of his troops. After the war, the rise of the Iron Curtain and nuclear weapons only increased the need for sustained intelligence-gathering. And so, in the early days of the Cold War, President Truman created the National Security Agency to give us insight into the Soviet bloc, and provide our leaders with information they needed to confront aggression and avert catastrophe. Throughout this evolution, we benefited from both our Constitution and traditions of limited government. U.S. intelligence agencies were anchored in our system of checks and balances - with oversight from elected leaders, and protections for ordinary citizens. Meanwhile, totalitarian states like East Germany offered a cautionary tale of what could happen when vast, unchecked surveillance turned citizens into informers, and persecuted people for what they said in the privacy of their own homes. In fact even the United States proved not to be immune to the abuse of surveillance. In the 1960s, government spied on civil rights leaders and critics of the Vietnam War. Partly in response to these revelations, additional laws were established in the 1970s to ensure that our intelligence capabilities could not be misused against our citizens. In the long, twilight struggle against Communism, we had been reminded that the very liberties that we sought to preserve could not be sacrificed at the altar of national security. If the fall of the Soviet Union left America without a competing superpower, emerging threats from terrorist groups, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction placed new - and, in some ways more complicated - demands on our intelligence agencies. Globalization and the Internet made these threats more acute, as technology erased borders and empowered individuals to project great violence, as well as great good. Moreover, these new threats raised new legal and policy questions. For while few doubted the legitimacy of spying on hostile states, our framework of laws was not fully adapted to prevent terrorist attacks by individuals acting on their own, or acting in small, ideologically driven groups rather than on behalf of a foreign power. The horror of September 11th brought these issues to the fore. Across the political spectrum, Americans recognized that we had to adapt to a world in which a bomb could be built in a basement, and our electric grid could be shut down by operators an ocean away. We were shaken by the signs we had missed leading up to the attacks - how the hijackers had made phone calls to known extremists, and travelled to suspicious places. So we demanded that our intelligence community improve its capabilities, and that law enforcement change practices to focus more on preventing attacks before they happen than prosecuting terrorists after an attack. It is hard to overstate the transformation America's intelligence community had to go through after 9/11. Our agencies suddenly needed to do far more than the traditional mission of monitoring hostile powers and gathering information for policymakers - instead, they were asked to identify and target plotters in some of the most remote parts of the world, and to anticipate the actions of networks that, by their very nature, cannot be easily penetrated with spies or informants. And it is a testimony to the hard work and dedication of the men and women in our intelligence community that over the past decade, we made enormous strides in fulfilling this mission. Today, new capabilities allow intelligence agencies to track who a terrorist is in contact with, and follow the trail of his travel or funding. New laws allow information to be collected and shared more quickly between federal agencies, and state and local law enforcement. Relationships with foreign intelligence services have expanded, and our capacity to repel cyber-attacks has been strengthened. Taken together, these efforts have prevented multiple attacks and saved innocent lives - not just here in the United States, but around the globe as well. And yet, in our rush to respond to very real and novel threats, the risks of government overreach - the possibility that we lose some of our core liberties in pursuit of security - became more pronounced. We saw, in the immediate aftermath of 9/11, our government engaged in enhanced interrogation techniques that contradicted our values. As a Senator, I was critical of several practices, such as warrantless wiretaps. And all too often new authorities were instituted without adequate public debate. Through a combination of action by the courts, increased congressional oversight, and adjustments by the previous Administration, some of the worst excesses that emerged after 9/11 were curbed by the time I took office. But a variety of factors have continued to complicate America's efforts to both defend our nation and uphold our civil liberties. First, the same technological advances that allow U.S. intelligence agencies to pin-point an al Qaeda cell in Yemen or an email between two terrorists in the Sahel, also mean that many routine communications around the world are within our reach. At a time when more and more of our lives are digital, that prospect is disquieting for all of us. Second, the combination of increased digital information and powerful supercomputers offers intelligence agencies the possibility of sifting through massive amounts of bulk data to identify patterns or pursue leads that may thwart impending threats. But the government collection and storage of such bulk data also creates a potential for abuse. Third, the legal safeguards that restrict surveillance against U.S. persons without a warrant do not apply to foreign persons overseas. This is not unique to America; few, if any, spy agencies around the world constrain their activities beyond their own borders. And the whole point of intelligence is to obtain information that is not publicly available. But America's capabilities are unique. And the power of new technologies means that there are fewer and fewer technical constraints on what we can do. That places a special obligation on us to ask tough questions about what we should do. Finally, intelligence agencies cannot function without secrecy, which makes their work less subject to public debate. Yet there is an inevitable bias not only within the intelligence community, but among all who are responsible for national security, to collect more information about the world, not less. So in the absence of institutional requirements for regular debate - and oversight that is public, as well as private - the danger of government overreach becomes more acute. This is particularly true when surveillance technology and our reliance on digital information is evolving much faster than our laws. For all these reasons, I maintained a healthy skepticism toward our surveillance programs after I became President. I ordered that our programs be reviewed by my national security team and our lawyers, and in some cases I ordered changes in how we did business. We increased oversight and auditing, including new structures aimed at compliance. Improved rules were proposed by the government and approved by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. And we sought to keep Congress continually updated on these activities. What I did not do is stop these programs wholesale - not only because I felt that they made us more secure; but also because nothing in that initial review, and nothing that I have learned since, indicated that our intelligence community has sought to violate the law or is cavalier about the civil liberties of their fellow citizens. To the contrary, in an extraordinarily difficult job, one in which actions are second-guessed, success is unreported, and failure can be catastrophic, the men and women of the intelligence community, including the NSA, consistently follow protocols designed to protect the privacy of ordinary people. They are not abusing authorities in order to listen to your private phone calls, or read your emails. When mistakes are made - which is inevitable in any large and complicated human enterprise - they correct those mistakes. Laboring in obscurity, often unable to discuss their work even with family and friends, they know that if another 9/11 or massive cyber-attack occurs, they will be asked, by Congress and the media, why they failed to connect the dots. What sustains those who work at NSA through all these pressures is the knowledge that their professionalism and dedication play a central role in the defense of our nation. To say that our intelligence community follows the law, and is staffed by patriots, is not to suggest that I, or others in my Administration, felt complacent about the potential impact of these programs. Those of us who hold office in America have a responsibility to our Constitution, and while I was confident in the integrity of those in our intelligence community, it was clear to me in observing our intelligence operations on a regular basis that changes in our technological capabilities were raising new questions about the privacy safeguards currently in place. Moreover, after an extended review of our use of drones in the fight against terrorist networks, I believed a fresh examination of our surveillance programs was a necessary next step in our effort to get off the open ended war-footing that we have maintained since 9/11. For these reasons, I indicated in a speech at the National Defense University last May that we needed a more robust public discussion about the balance between security and liberty. What I did not know at the time is that within weeks of my speech, an avalanche of unauthorized disclosures would spark controversies at home and abroad that have continued to this day. Given the fact of an open investigation, I'm not going to dwell on Mr. Snowden's actions or motivations. I will say that our nation's defense depends in part on the fidelity of those entrusted with our nation's secrets. If any individual who objects to government policy can take it in their own hands to publicly disclose classified information, then we will never be able to keep our people safe, or conduct foreign policy. Moreover, the sensational way in which these disclosures have come out has often shed more heat than light, while revealing methods to our adversaries that could impact our operations in ways that we may not fully understand for years to come. Regardless of how we got here, though, the task before us now is greater than simply repairing the damage done to our operations; or preventing more disclosures from taking place in the future. Instead, we have to make some important decisions about how to protect ourselves and sustain our leadership in the world, while upholding the civil liberties and privacy protections that our ideals - and our Constitution - require. We need to do so not only because it is right, but because the challenges posed by threats like terrorism, proliferation, and cyber-attacks are not going away any time soon, and for our intelligence community to be effective over the long haul, we must maintain the trust of the American people, and people around the world. This effort will not be completed overnight, and given the pace of technological change, we shouldn't expect this to be the last time America has this debate. But I want the American people to know that the work has begun. Over the last six months, I created an outside Review Group on Intelligence and Communications Technologies to make recommendations for reform. I've consulted with the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board. I've listened to foreign partners, privacy advocates, and industry leaders. My Administration has spent countless hours considering how to approach intelligence in this era of diffuse threats and technological revolution. And before outlining specific changes that I have ordered, let me make a few broad observations that have emerged from this process. First, everyone who has looked at these problems, including skeptics of existing programs, recognizes that we have real enemies and threats, and that intelligence serves a vital role in confronting them. We cannot prevent terrorist attacks or cyber-threats without some capability to penetrate digital communications - whether it's to unravel a terrorist plot; to intercept malware that targets a stock exchange; to make sure air traffic control systems are not compromised; or to ensure that hackers do not empty your bank accounts. Moreover, we cannot unilaterally disarm our intelligence agencies. There is a reason why blackberries and I-Phones are not allowed in the White House Situation Room. We know that the intelligence services of other countries - including some who feign surprise over the Snowden disclosures - are constantly probing our government and private sector networks, and accelerating programs to listen to our conversations, intercept our emails, or compromise our systems. Meanwhile, a number of countries, including some who have loudly criticized the NSA, privately acknowledge that America has special responsibilities as the world's only superpower; that our intelligence capabilities are critical to meeting these responsibilities; and that they themselves have relied on the information we obtain to protect their own people. Second, just as ardent civil libertarians recognize the need for robust intelligence capabilities, those with responsibilities for our national security readily acknowledge the potential for abuse as intelligence capabilities advance, and more and more private information is digitized. After all, the folks at NSA and other intelligence agencies are our neighbors and our friends. They have electronic bank and medical records like everyone else. They have kids on Facebook and Instagram, and they know, more than most of us, the vulnerabilities to privacy that exist in a world where transactions are recorded; emails and text messages are stored; and even our movements can be tracked through the GPS on our phones. Third, there was a recognition by all who participated in these reviews that the challenges to our privacy do not come from government alone. Corporations of all shapes and sizes track what you buy, store and analyze our data, and use it for commercial purposes; that's how those targeted ads pop up on your computer or smartphone. But all of us understand that the standards for government surveillance must be higher. Given the unique power of the state, it is not enough for leaders to say: trust us, we won't abuse the data we collect. For history has too many examples when that trust has been breached. Our system of government is built on the premise that our liberty cannot depend on the good intentions of those in power; it depends upon the law to constrain those in power. I make these observations to underscore that the basic values of most Americans when it comes to questions of surveillance and privacy converge far more than the crude characterizations that have emerged over the last several months. Those who are troubled by our existing programs are not interested in a repeat of 9/11, and those who defend these programs are not dismissive of civil liberties. The challenge is getting the details right, and that's not simple. Indeed, during the course of our review, I have often reminded myself that I would not be where I am today were it not for the courage of dissidents, like Dr. King, who were spied on by their own government; as a President who looks at intelligence every morning, I also can't help but be reminded that America must be vigilant in the face of threats. Fortunately, by focusing on facts and specifics rather than speculation and hypotheticals, this review process has given me - and hopefully the American people - some clear direction for change. And today, I can announce a series of concrete and substantial reforms that my Administration intends to adopt administratively or will seek to codify with Congress. First, I have approved a new presidential directive for our signals intelligence activities, at home and abroad. This guidance will strengthen executive branch oversight of our intelligence activities. It will ensure that we take into account our security requirements, but also our alliances; our trade and investment relationships, including the concerns of America's companies; and our commitment to privacy and basic liberties. And we will review decisions about intelligence priorities and sensitive targets on an annual basis, so that our actions are regularly scrutinized by my senior national security team. Second, we will reform programs and procedures in place to provide greater transparency to our surveillance activities, and fortify the safeguards that protect the privacy of U.S. persons. Since we began this review, including information being released today, we have declassified over 40 opinions and orders of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, which provides judicial review of some of our most sensitive intelligence activities - including the Section 702 program targeting foreign individuals overseas and the Section 215 telephone metadata program. Going forward, I am directing the Director of National Intelligence, in consultation with the Attorney General, to annually review - for the purpose of declassification - any future opinions of the Court with broad privacy implications, and to report to me and Congress on these efforts. To ensure that the Court hears a broader range of privacy perspectives, I am calling on Congress to authorize the establishment of a panel of advocates from outside government to provide an independent voice in significant cases before the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. Third, we will provide additional protections for activities conducted under Section 702, which allows the government to intercept the communications of foreign targets overseas who have information that's important for our national security. Specifically, I am asking the Attorney General and DNI to institute reforms that place additional restrictions on government's ability to retain, search, and use in criminal cases, communications between Americans and foreign citizens incidentally collected under Section 702. Fourth, in investigating threats, the FBI also relies on National Security Letters, which can  require companies to provide specific and limited information to the government without disclosing the orders to the subject of the investigation. These are cases in which it is important that the subject of the investigation, such as a possible terrorist or spy, isn't tipped off. But we can - and should - be more transparent in how government uses this authority. I have therefore directed the Attorney General to amend how we use National Security Letters so this secrecy will not be indefinite, and will terminate within a fixed time unless the government demonstrates a real need for further secrecy.  We will also enable communications providers to make public more information than ever before about the orders they have received to provide data to the government. This brings me to program that has generated the most controversy these past few months - the bulk collection of telephone records under Section 215. Let me repeat what I said when this story first broke - this program does not involve the content of phone calls, or the names of people making calls. Instead, it provides a record of phone numbers and the times and lengths of calls - meta-data that can be queried if and when we have a reasonable suspicion that a particular number is linked to a terrorist organization. Why is this necessary? The program grew out of a desire to address a gap identified after 9/11. One of the 9/11 hijackers - Khalid al-Mihdhar - made a phone call from San Diego to a known al Qaeda safe-house in Yemen. NSA saw that call, but could not see that it was coming from an individual already in the United States. The telephone metadata program under Section 215 was designed to map the communications of terrorists, so we can see who they may be in contact with as quickly as possible. This capability could also prove valuable in a crisis. For example, if a bomb goes off in one of our cities and law enforcement is racing to determine whether a network is poised to conduct additional attacks, time is of the essence.  Being able to quickly review telephone connections to assess whether a network exists is critical to that effort. In sum, the program does not involve the NSA examining the phone records of ordinary Americans. Rather, it consolidates these records into a database that the government can query if it has a specific lead - phone records that the companies already retain for business purposes. The Review Group turned up no indication that this database has been intentionally abused. And I believe it is important that the capability that this program is designed to meet is preserved. Having said that, I believe critics are right to point out that without proper safeguards, this type of program could be used to yield more information about our private lives, and open the door to more intrusive, bulk collection programs. They also rightly point out that although the telephone bulk collection program was subject to oversight by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court and has been reauthorized repeatedly by Congress, it has never been subject to vigorous public debate. For all these reasons, I believe we need a new approach. I am therefore ordering a transition that will end the Section 215 bulk metadata program as it currently exists, and establish a mechanism that preserves the capabilities we need without the government holding this bulk meta-data. This will not be simple. The Review Group recommended that our current approach be replaced by one in which the providers or a third party retain the bulk records, with the government accessing information as needed. Both of these options pose difficult problems. Relying solely on the records of multiple providers, for example, could require companies to alter their procedures in ways that raise new privacy concerns. On the other hand, any third party maintaining a single, consolidated data-base would be carrying out what is essentially a government function with more expense, more legal ambiguity, and a doubtful impact on public confidence that their privacy is being protected. During the review process, some suggested that we may also be able to preserve the capabilities we need through a combination of existing authorities, better information sharing, and recent technological advances. But more work needs to be done to determine exactly how this system might work. Because of the challenges involved, I've ordered that the transition away from the existing program will proceed in two steps. Effective immediately, we will only pursue phone calls that are two steps removed from a number associated with a terrorist organization instead of three. And I have directed the Attorney General to work with the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court so that during this transition period, the database can be queried only after a judicial finding, or in a true emergency. Next, I have instructed the intelligence community and Attorney General to use this transition period to develop options for a new approach that can match the capabilities and fill the gaps that the Section 215 program was designed to address without the government holding this meta-data. They will report back to me with options for alternative approaches before the program comes up for reauthorization on March 28.  During this period, I will consult with the relevant committees in Congress to seek their views, and then seek congressional authorization for the new program as needed. The reforms I'm proposing today should give the American people greater confidence that their rights are being protected, even as our intelligence and law enforcement agencies maintain the tools they need to keep us safe. I recognize that there are additional issues that require further debate. For example, some who participated in our review, as well as some in Congress, would like to see more sweeping reforms to the use of National Security Letters, so that we have to go to a judge before issuing these requests. Here, I have concerns that we should not set a standard for terrorism investigations that is higher than those involved in investigating an ordinary crime. But I agree that greater oversight on the use of these letters may be appropriate, and am prepared to work with Congress on this issue.  There are also those who would like to see different changes to the FISA court than the ones I have proposed. On all of these issues, I am open to working with Congress to ensure that we build a broad consensus for how to move forward, and am confident that we can shape an approach that meets our security needs while upholding the civil liberties of every American. Let me now turn to the separate set of concerns that have been raised overseas, and focus on America's approach to intelligence collection abroad. As I've indicated, the United States has unique responsibilities when it comes to intelligence collection. Our capabilities help protect not only our own nation, but our friends and allies as well. Our efforts will only be effective if ordinary citizens in other countries have confidence that the United States respects their privacy too. And the leaders of our close friends and allies deserve to know that if I want to learn what they think about an issue, I will pick up the phone and call them, rather than turning to surveillance. In other words, just as we balance security and privacy at home, our global leadership demands that we balance our security requirements against our need to maintain trust and cooperation among people and leaders around the world. For that reason, the new presidential directive that I have issued today will clearly prescribe what we do, and do not do, when it comes to our overseas surveillance. To begin with, the directive makes clear that the United States only uses signals intelligence for legitimate national security purposes, and not for the purpose of indiscriminately reviewing the emails or phone calls of ordinary people. I have also made it clear that the United States does not collect intelligence to suppress criticism or dissent, nor do we collect intelligence to disadvantage people on the basis of their ethnicity, race, gender, sexual orientation, or religious beliefs. And we do not collect intelligence to provide a competitive advantage to U.S. companies, or U.S. commercial sectors. In terms of our bulk collection of signals intelligence, U.S. intelligence agencies will only use such data to meet specific security requirements: counter-intelligence; counter-terrorism; counter-proliferation; cyber-security; force protection for our troops and allies; and combating transnational crime, including sanctions evasion. Moreover, I have directed that we take the unprecedented step of extending certain protections that we have for the American people to people overseas. I have directed the DNI, in consultation with the Attorney General, to develop these safeguards, which will limit the duration that we can hold personal information, while also restricting the use of this information. The bottom line is that people around the world - regardless of their nationality - should know that the United States is not spying on ordinary people who don't threaten our national security, and that we take their privacy concerns into account. This applies to foreign leaders as well. Given the understandable attention that this issue has received, I have made clear to the intelligence community that - unless there is a compelling national security purpose - we will not monitor the communications of heads of state and government of our close friends and allies. And I've instructed my national security team, as well as the intelligence community, to work with foreign counterparts to deepen our coordination and cooperation in ways that rebuild trust going forward. Now let me be clear: our intelligence agencies will continue to gather information about the intentions of governments - as opposed to ordinary citizens - around the world, in the same way that the intelligence services of every other nation does. We will not apologize simply because our services may be more effective. But heads of state and government with whom we work closely, and on whose cooperation we depend, should feel confident that we are treating them as real partners. The changes I've ordered do just that. Finally, to make sure that we follow through on these reforms, I am making some important changes to how our government is organized. The State Department will designate a senior officer to coordinate our diplomacy on issues related to technology and signals intelligence. We will appoint a senior official at the White House to implement the new privacy safeguards that I have announced today. I will devote the resources to centralize and improve the process we use to handle foreign requests for legal assistance, keeping our high standards for privacy while helping foreign partners fight crime and terrorism. I have also asked my Counselor, John Podesta, to lead a comprehensive review of big data and privacy. This group will consist of government officials who-along with the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology-will reach out to privacy experts, technologists and business leaders, and look at how the challenges inherent in big data are being  confronted by both the public and private sectors; whether we can forge international norms on how to manage this data; and how we can continue to promote the free flow of information in ways that are consistent with both privacy and security. For ultimately, what's at stake in this debate goes far beyond a few months of headlines, or passing tensions in our foreign policy. When you cut through the noise, what's really at stake is how we remain true to who we are in a world that is remaking itself at dizzying speed. Whether it's the ability of individuals to communicate ideas; to access information that would have once filled every great library in every country in the world; or to forge bonds with people on other sides of the globe, technology is remaking what is possible for individuals, for institutions, and for the international order. So while the reforms that I have announced will point us in a new direction, I am mindful that more work will be needed in the future. One thing I'm certain of: this debate will make us stronger. And I also know that in this time of change, the United States of America will have to lead. It may seem sometimes that America is being held to a different standard, and the readiness of some to assume the worst motives by our government can be frustrating. No one expects China to have an open debate about their surveillance programs, or Russia to take the privacy concerns of citizens into account. But let us remember that we are held to a different standard precisely because we have been at the forefront in defending personal privacy and human dignity. As the nation that developed the Internet, the world expects us to ensure that the digital revolution works as a tool for individual empowerment rather than government control. Having faced down the totalitarian dangers of fascism and communism, the world expects us to stand up for the principle that every person has the right to think and write and form relationships freely - because individual freedom is the wellspring of human progress. Those values make us who we are. And because of the strength of our own democracy, we should not shy away from high expectations. For more than two centuries, our Constitution has weathered every type of change because we have been willing to defend it, and because we have been willing to question the actions that have been taken in its defense. Today is no different. Together, let us chart a way forward that secures the life of our nation, while preserving the liberties that make our nation worth fighting for.

They've got a high profile because their song is on the radio, but 90% of the crowd will peace out after they finally shut up and play the hit. Hozier's got a guitar, though, so for one night, he's bigger than Raekwon and Ghostface. 3. Lil B (Night 3): UNBASEDLY SMALL You wanna talk about earning the zeitgest, Interpol?

Over Thanksgiving, I watched as my parents sat back, strapped in, and explored the space station from Christopher Nolan’s Interstellar. For studios looking to promote movies and TV shows, virtual reality has become a go-to gimmick, giving audiences a sneak peek at new technology that’s just around the corner. At CES, Fox Searchlight is taking that a step further with the debut of Wild — The Experience. Based on the movie of the same name, it’s a 3-minute narrative that puts the viewer in an original scene right alongside Reese Witherspoon and Laura Dern. And those behind the project are betting that one day, VR won’t just be a promotional tool — but the main attraction itself. The Wild experience is the first official title from the Fox Innovation Lab, a think tank and experimentation center for 20th Century Fox and its sister studios. ""We started [the lab] about a year ago, and the idea was that our relationship with consumer electronics manufacturers — just in general between Hollywood and CE — it just seemed we were out of sync,"" says Mike Dunn, president of Fox Home Entertainment. With physical media sales shrinking faster than expected and theatrical attendance steadily declining, the need to get ahead of the next big thing before it becomes the next big thing is obvious. Media disruption has already arrived; it’s just a matter of what side of tech history movie studios will end up on. For Fox, that meant teaming up with Samsung (Wild runs on the Gear VR, and the studio partnered on the new SUHD TVs) and branching out to virtual reality. In Los Angeles, Fox’s resident futurist Ted Schilowitz works out of the lab’s ""VR bunker."" It’s a large conference room with a massive bank of flat-panel screens against one wall, and two smaller rooms off to the side. One of the side rooms has an array of computers, displays, and Oculus gear, while the other is filled with props from the Wild shoot. (It also has projectors trained against each wall; Schilowitz tells me they use it for four-wall immersive experiments.) Schilowitz, who also co-founded RED Camera, worked with Fox on several of its prior VR experiments, including the Sleepy Hollow and X-Men Comic-Con pieces. But creating something from a slow-paced drama like Wild — the real-life story of Cheryl Strayed (Witherspoon), who hiked a thousand miles along the Pacific Crest Trail in an effort to deal with her mother’s death — was a different challenge. ""This was this interesting kind of wild card, because it’s this very naturalistic movie that you wouldn’t expect something tied to technology,"" says Schilowitz. The team chose to depict a single moment along Strayed’s trek where she stops, takes a breath, and is visited by the ghost of her mother (Dern). Directors Félix Lajeunesse and Paul Raphaël were chosen to tackle the project due to their ability to create slow, more emotional VR experiences — a far cry from bombastic VR demos like EVE Valkyrie or Alien: Isolation. The result is a VR narrative that rewards patience, with the interactive components keying off subtle cues from the viewer. Look one way at a given moment, and you may see Strayed’s mother watching over her; look at a different time, and she may never appear at all. Wild — The Experience is largely a proof-of-concept, Schilowitz says, designed as a starting point for narrative experimentation. ""Now we’re more intrigued to take it further. And some of the very high-level execs that we’ve shown [this to] at Fox said the same thing: we should look at doing something like this for every movie and TV show that we have."" Fox currently has around 40 movies in development, and the lab has been looking at which new projects would be well-suited for a VR tie-in; they expect to launch up to three new experiences in 2015 alone. The Wild piece will be traveling to this year’s Sundance Film Festival where it’ll premiere to the general public, but as the medium develops, Schilowitz and Dunn expect that these virtual reality narratives will become standalone pieces of content that people will purchase for viewing on their own. ""I’m sure that this technology will be used as a promotional means for the movie in the theatrical window, and maybe home entertainment,"" Dunn says, ""but I think for it to be really relevant to the consumer it needs to be a real product. If it tends to be just promotional, then it’s more like an innovative gimmick than the real deal."" That, of course, is a hill that far too many cool ideas and technological trends have fought and died on without ever going mainstream. (QR codes and alternate reality games, I’m looking at you.) But as Dunn sees it, the vast potential of virtual reality makes it too useful to fail: with applications across gaming, entertainment, education, and more, it’s the kind of transformative technology that will inevitably become integrated into people’s lives. Meanwhile, it’s up to Fox and others to develop content  that makes using the technology worthwhile — and that’s a challenge Schilowitz and his team are up for. ""We’re not just going to stay in place because we’re a movie studio, and the thing that movie studios do is put up pictures on a rectangle,"" Schilowitz says. ""What we do is we make stories. And if there’s a new way to tell those stories, we need to be involved in it, and we need to be figuring it out.""

At a CES that's full of attempts at making VR work, the recently announced prototype is one of the most interesting headsets. Instead of an LCD screen, it uses a virtual retinal display that projects images on your eyes. Instead of attempting immersion, it limits the display to a square with a roughly 45-degree field of view, leaving your peripheral vision free. And Avegant, the company behind it, is doing its best to fool casual observers into thinking it's a pair of high-end headphones with a pair of weird bumps on top. Because let's be honest, wearing a pair of VR goggles in public still feels kind of dumb.   In fact, the creators don't actually describe it as VR. The Glyph can handle head tracking for games or virtual movies, but Avegant CSO Edward Tang describes it as a replacement for a mobile screen — instead of squinting at your iPhone on a plane, you can plug in the Glyph with an HDMI cable and watch movies on the equivalent of an 80-inch TV. It shares some DNA with the personal 3D theaters that Sony and others produced in years past, but the technology and hardware are fundamentally different. Even the highest-definition screen-based virtual reality displays, like the Gear VR, have visible pixels that mar the experience. When you look through the eyepieces of the Glyph engineering prototype, by contrast, you'll see a perfectly clear, brilliantly colored image, floating in front of you with virtually no lag. We took a look at an early version of the Glyph in 2013, but its engineering prototype has slimmed down significantly since then. It could reasonably pass for a pair of oversized, heavily padded headphones, with an optional strap that slides over the top of your head. I've gotten used to slight blurriness in VR headsets, so the Glyph's image quality was comparatively amazing, as was its adjustability; you can slide the lenses sideways to change the distance between your eyes and focus each one with a wheel on the bottom. The obvious compromise is that you won't get the same sense of being in a place. Its low field of view (roughly 45 degrees, compared to closer to 100 degrees for the Oculus Rift) leaves large black spaces around the screen, and the visor doesn't quite black out the rest of the world. That's not all bad — there's something to be said for having situational awareness in a mobile headset. But it's why Avegant is right to distance itself from companies that are trying to create full 360-degree experiences. At CES, the company finally unveiled the design mockup that  it hopes to turn into a consumer product by fall of 2015. It's a distinctly Beats-inspired pair of chunky headphones with lenses set into the top. When you're using them purely for sound, you can cover the eyepieces in a plastic protector, keeping them free of hair product or skin oil. To switch to headset mode, you tilt them forward to act as a rounded visor — instead of evoking Johnny Mnemonic, you'll look more like LeVar Burton in Star Trek. Ideally, there's no strap, just the pressure of the ear cups to hold the Glyph in place. While people will probably still look at you funny when you slide it over your eyes, it's far more natural than taking out a pair of virtual ski goggles. One of my biggest problems with the Gear VR was its sheer bulk, but I could actually imagine keeping the Glyph headphones around my neck. The problem is that with no support, it's incredibly difficult to keep the headset tilted at an angle that will give you that perfect image. The preliminary mockup was a fixed size, so I couldn't make it small enough to rest on my ears and nose at the same time; every time I tried to wear it, it just slid down my face. The heavier engineering prototype fit me, but to see clearly, I had to either hold it in place or tilt my face almost horizontal. Avegant is confident that this issue will be solved by launch, but it's set quite the task for itself. It has to produce a device that has minimal nose support, limited adjustability, and no overhead straps, but can still fit in a precise position over anyone's eyes. If the optics get light enough or the ear cups tight enough, this might be possible, but given that the Glyph in its current form is almost unusable, it's hard to make a call on how likely it is. If you're looking for virtual reality per se, the Glyph is no Oculus Rift or Gear VR. At $599 (or $499, if you pre-order by January 15th) Its strict focus on image quality and portability, though, make it more than just another runner-up. Avegant's move away from screens puts it more in the company of Google Glass or the mysterious Magic Leap system, but without the difficulty of cracking augmented reality. And if you end up getting too uncomfortable to put them over your eyes... well, at least you've still got a pair of headphones.

Scientists in the US this week announced a new, and potentially groundbreaking method for producing nanocellulose — a so-called ""wonder material"" derived from tree fiber that could be used to create ultra-thin displays, lightweight body armor, and a wide range of other products. Their key ingredient? Algae.   ""one of the most important discoveries in plant biology"" Dr. R. Malcolm Brown, a biology professor at the University of Texas at Austin, presented his team's findings at an American Chemical Society conference in New Orleans on Sunday, heralding their progress as a major step toward ""one of the most important discoveries in plant biology."" At the core of Brown's research is a family of bacteria that produce vinegar, Kombucha tea, and nata de coco. These bacteria secrete nanocellulose in a culture medium, though extracting the material at a large scale would require high volumes of sugars, nutrients, and fermentation tanks. Today, most non-bacterial nanocellulose is produced from compressed and homogenized wood pulp — a relatively inexpensive, but resource-heavy process. Brown's method, by contrast, is vastly more efficient and environmentally friendly, requiring only sunlight, water, and algae. By genetically engineering vinegar bacterium into blue-green algae, Brown's lab has effectively created organic factories capable of making nanocellulose on a potentially industrial scale. Organic, self-sustaining factories   These genetically-altered algae, known as cyanobacteria, are entirely self-sustaining. They produce their own food from sunlight and water, and absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, offering a natural way to reduce the world's most pernicious greenhouse gas. The team is currently working on synthesizing a more complete and stable form of the material, though their progress is already promising. If scaled up, Brown's method could have a dramatic impact across several sectors. Cellulose is the most abundant organic polymer on Earth, forming a major component in tree trunks, dietary fibers, and cotton. Nanocellulose shares some similar properties, though it's notably more versatile  — lightweight, stiffer than Kevlar, and, under certain conditions, conductive. Advances in genetic engineering have only expanded its potential. Last year, researchers in Finland created a nanocellulose aerogel with an incredibly high buoyancy. According to the scientists, a one-pound boat made of this substance would be able to carry up to 1,000 pounds of cargo. Brown says bacterial nanocellulose can also be used to create ballistic glass, aerospace materials, or even wound dressings, due to the fact that it retains its stiffness and strength even when submerged in liquid. But perhaps its most obvious application would be in the paper and display industry. Thin, lightweight, and remarkably versatile   At a press briefing Sunday, Brown said he and his team have begun adding electrochromic dye to the cellulose to create an electronic display. “I see this as a major development,"" he said, noting that its thin and flexible qualities make it ideal for electronic wallpaper, as well. It's unlikely that Brown's material will completely replace traditional paper, but its sustainable qualities present obvious environmental benefits. ""It certainly won't replace or supplant the forest and paper industry, but it could supplement it,"" Brown said in an interview with The Verge, adding that his technique, if widely adopted, could help reduce deforestation. Brown's lab is still ""five to ten years"" away from adapting the process to a large scale, though he says the science behind it is sound. All they need now, the professor explains, is broader awareness and momentum. Last year, the US Forest Service opened the country's first nanocellulose production facility in Wisconsin, in an effort to take the lead in renewable nanomaterials. After devoting 40 years to nanocellulose research, Brown hopes that his latest developments will encourage similar investments. ""We need to have more funds in this area,"" Brown told reporters. ""So having the chance to tell the world more about this new microorganism will, I think, help tip the funding. I hope so.""",0.7532420437312222,0.24675795626877783,0.7476309116952208,678,5.5412979351032448,410,6.6829268292682924,0,0,"Science, Report",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

This simpler antibody would immunize against fewer versions of HIV than its more complicated forms, but there's a better chance that scientists will be able to implement it effectively. Recent technology allowed the researchers to identify a patient earlier after infection than previously possible — thereby giving them access to the simpler antibodies. The person studied was among the 20 percent of patients who developed ""broadly neutralizing"" antibodies that can identify and fight multiple versions of HIV.

The process, published in Science by an Oxford University team led by Hagan Bayley, prints a network of droplets made out of aqueous solutions — a liquid mixture — instead of the solids that standard 3D printers produce. The printer, made specifically for this experiment since already-existent models weren't up to the task, places tiny drops of liquid into an oil solution. The drops, instead of adhering to one another, are naturally separated by a lipid layer. When networks of these drops are printed in the tens of thousands — the researchers have produced networks containing up to 35,000 drops — the final result resembles caviar and has an elasticity similar to that of brain and fat tissues. These networks, according to the researchers, currently have a stable shelf life of a few weeks. Tissue made of tens of thousands of droplets  The possibilities for this synthetic tissue get particularly interesting when you consider that the liquid inside the droplets can be swapped out. The researchers were able to send electrical signals through one of these networks by including membrane proteins inside the solution, allowing the 3D printed material to mimic nerves. As illustrated in the photograph below, researchers were able to effectively pass electric signals through a pathway of green droplets including the protein, which are insulated by other clear droplets.  Another experiment used varying concentrations of solution in each droplet to create networks that can fold themselves into unique shapes that the 3D printer can't produce — like a hollow sphere that closes like the petals of a flower (see video at bottom of page). As you may remember from high school biology, water can pass through membranes to produce an equilibrium by osmosis; this action is what causes the structures to fold to the scientists' whims. The development clearly reveals a new type of 3D printing, but the researchers say that as the networks get more advanced they may be able to integrate them with living organisms. They suggest that, with further development, such 3D-printed networks could help facilitate drug applications or help support failing tissues. They note that since this method is entirely synthetic, the networks lack a genome and the ability to replicate — avoiding some of the difficulties other artificial tissue production methods have faced. As lead researcher Hagan Bayley tells Oxford University, ""we aren't trying to make materials that faithfully resemble tissues but rather structures that can carry out the functions of tissues.""

According to Donald Yeomans, head of NASA’s Near Earth Object program, the robotic spaceship that will trap the asteroid will be like “a baggie with a drawstring,” reports The Associated Press. After you “bag” the object, you just need to “attach the solar propulsion module to de-spin it and bring it back to where you want it,” which sounds easy enough. In order to do that, the project would need a new, cutting-edge solar engine, said former NASA CTO Robert Braun.

The idea of recording dreams has been a mainstay in science fiction, but also a frequent goal for researchers. As Smithsonian Magazine writes, this group designed its study based on the premise that brains react to ""seeing"" objects with repeatable patterns that can be measured with MRI. If a machine can recognize the patterns well enough, it can reverse-engineer them, giving us a window into what's going on inside people's heads while they dream. Three participants were selected for a study and asked to sleep for several three-hour blocks in an MRI scanner. Once they fell asleep, scientists woke them up and asked them to describe what they'd seen in the dream, grouping them into loose categories and sub-categories like ""car,"" ""male,"" ""female,"" or ""dwelling."" The group then picked representations of those categories from an online image search and showed them to the participants, once again measuring their brain activity to figure out what patterns might be unique to that concept. Finally, the participants were asked to sleep again, but this time, a machine wouldn't simply record how their brain responded to dreaming — it would attempt to match it to one of the categories with a series of images, as seen in the video below.  When matching the contents of the video to the categories the sleeper actually recounted when asked about a dream, the machine turned out to be right roughly 60 percent of the time, or better than it could have done by random chance. The system was unsurprisingly better at detecting general meta-categories, like whether someone was looking at a person or a scene, than it was at sensing more specific objects. Several steps towards effective dream recording have been made over the past several years. In 2005, one of the authors of this paper — Yukiyasu Kamitani — published a similar study in which he detected basic aspects of perception with functional MRI. Kamitani further explored the idea of predicting what people see from their brain activity in subsequent work, reconstructing an image from scratch after having a subject look at it. Another group from UC Berkeley has also been trying to crack the problem of recording dreams. Professor Jack Gallant's lab has put together equally eerie videos reconstructing and decoding people's brain activity as they watch movie trailers, though these are recreations of real visual stimuli, not the images we see while dreaming.",0.4240539213810266,0.5759460786189734,0.2230264731677151,423,5.0709219858156027,253,6.0039525691699609,0,0,Science,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

At first, I thought there was an issue with the app, but after going through the login process, it became clear that it was something else entirely: I’d become one of the latest victims of Facebook’s real name policy. This wasn’t a huge shock for me. Though my entire career is conducted under the name Lux Alptraum — which has appeared as my byline at publications ranging from The Guardian and Al Jazeera America to Cosmopolitan and Fast Company — it is not the name that appears on my legal identification; given the unusual nature of the name, it’s not entirely surprising that it eventually set off someone’s red flag. Though many first heard of the real name policy last fall, when it led to the suspension of a number of drag queens’ accounts, it’s actually been in effect since the beginning of Facebook. And for a number of years, it’s been plagued by accusations that it’s racist, transphobic, and insensitive to the privacy concerns of vulnerable populations, like domestic violence victims and sex workers. One core issue comes from the fact that Facebook does not require all of its users to submit legal proof of their names. As with many of its systems, its real name enforcement seems to rely on a combination of automation and human monitoring. Under this system, names that sound ""fake,"" or involve dictionary words, are more likely to be flagged. Plagued by accusations that it’s racist, transphobic, and insensitive to the privacy concerns of vulnerable populations Chances are good that you can use Facebook as John Smith even if your government name is something else entirely, but sign up with a non-European name (like Kurdistan or Kenyatta Cheese) or a name that doesn’t appear to align with your gender, and you may find yourself on the wrong side of the policy. In recent weeks, a number of Native American users have found that Facebook does not consider their names to be ""real"" enough, sometimes even after these users have submitted identification — an ironic disenfranchisement that has not gone unnoticed. Facebook’s real name policy is also inconsistently enforced, further complicating this issue, in addition to unfairly targeting more vulnerable populations. In the first week of February, radio host and blogger Jay Smooth found himself locked out of his Facebook account despite the fact that ""Jay Smooth [is] the only name [he’s] used publicly for 20+ years."" He was quickly reinstated, with Facebook production engineer Jeff Ferland tweeting an apology less than a day after Smooth’s tweeted complaint. Those who are well connected, or have the press on their side, find they don’t have to play by the same rules as others. (Indeed, when I discovered my account had been disabled, one of my first moves was to text a friend who works at Facebook, who assured me my account would be reinstated.) The search for a ""better"" real name policy is a bizarre and useless exercise In the aftermath of its drag queen drama, Facebook made a pledge to change, promising to reevaluate its policies to better support marginalized populations and allow users to make use of its services under a name that felt appropriate for them. In an email exchange sent to The Verge last year, a Facebook representative promised that ""our teams will continue to prioritize these improvements so everyone can be their authentic self on Facebook."" But my experience, and the experience of other recently blocked users, suggests otherwise. After getting locked out of my account, the only option I was offered was to update my name; there was no option to contact a Facebook representative or even submit any documentation to support my online identity. Underlying all of this is the fact that the search for a ""better"" real name policy is a bizarre and useless exercise, because ""real names"" are a clumsy metric for the issue that Facebook is trying to solve. If the desire is to prevent abuse, banning people who are largely using the service as intended seems counterintuitive. Monitoring behavior, rather than names, seems like a much more useful strategy. Furthermore, given all the tracking Facebook does in service of its advertising strategy, it doesn’t need users to present under their legal names to know who they ""really"" are. It should be able to devise a better system to determine who’s just setting up a fake account to troll, abuse, or misrepresent.",0.49005630788379495,0.509943692116205,0.8561441800979134,745,5.0,397,6.2367758186397984,0,0,"Culture, Web, Essay",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

BitPay will be processing all Bitcoin transactions on behalf of the team; the company will accept the virtual funds and pay the Kings in a more familiar currency: cash. “With BitPay, we are able to implement a technology that allows our fans to make Kings-related purchases without physically reaching into their wallets,"" Ranadive said in a press release. According to BitPay co-founder and CEO Tony Gallippi, the deal came together during last week's CES.

As BBC News reports, authorities have so far arrested 29 people as part of ""Operation Endeavor,"" an investigation spanning 14 countries. The investigation into the Philippines network was launched in 2012 by the UK's National Crime Agency (NCA), the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and the Australian Federal Police. The suspects in question are accused of paying to see children being abused online, in what the NCA describes as ""significant and emerging threat,"" particularly in the developing world. Payments totaled more than £37,500 ($61,268), authorities say, with some of that going directly to family members who were complicit in selling video of their children. So far, 15 children between the ages of six and 15 have been taken into custody, after being identified as victims. ""Being thousands of miles away makes no difference to their guilt."" In addition to Operation Endeavor, there are three ongoing investigations into child abuse rings, and 733 suspects have been identified. The NCA says crime groups have focused their efforts on developing countries, where high poverty rates and greater internet connectivity have made it easier to exploit children for cash. Several suspects have already been convicted, including Timothy Ford, whose 2012 arrest sparked Operation Endeavor. According to UK authorities, Ford planned to buy an internet cafe in the Philippines and rent out rooms to people on so-called ""pedopal vacations.""

That's according to a new report from The Guardian and the UK's Channel 4 News service, aided by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden. As part of the program, so-called ""untargeted"" texts are collected then analyzed by a separate service called ""Prefer,"" which is capable of pulling together detailed reports for the agency. News of the program comes from an internal NSA presentation dated June 2011, which refers to SMS text messages as ""a goldmine to exploit."" ""A goldmine to exploit"" Some of the information captured by the program includes names, phone numbers, and images, though other seemingly basic alerts offer a closer look at someone's habits. Three such examples are texts from banks and other services about financial transactions, detailed meeting information from calendar invites, as well as messages from wireless phone carriers that are sent when borders are crossed. The program also kept track of missed calls, passwords, and information about SIM cards. One key factor of Dishfire is how the data is treated for texts from within the US versus abroad. While American records are eventually removed, the presentation about Dishfire suggests data from other countries is stored for far longer.  And while the scale of the database is unclear from the documents, The Guardian notes that the NSA told analysts to limit searches to under 1,800 phone numbers. An NSA spokesperson reiterated to The Guardian that ""the implication that NSA's collection is arbitrary and unconstrained is false,"" adding that the agency's activities ""are focused and specifically deployed against — and only against — valid foreign intelligence targets in response to intelligence requirements."" On Dishfire specifically, the spokesperson said ""privacy protections for US persons exist across the entire process concerning the use, handling, retention, and dissemination of SMS data in Dishfire."" New details on the program come just a day before President Barack Obama is set to give a speech about public surveillance. A report by The Wall Street Journal earlier this week suggested the main topic will be sweeping changes to the agency, which has been embroiled in controversy since last year's leaks by Snowden.

Information on approximately 40 million credit and debit card accounts was stolen during the breach, and this sensitive financial data quickly appeared on the black market. Target would later reveal that names, mailing addresses, and phone numbers for up to 70 million customers had also been taken during the attack. The retailer is cooperating with the US Secret Service and Department of Justice to find those responsible; those perpetrators currently remain at large. Target's holiday breach ranks as one of the largest retail hacks in history. In response to the ordeal, the company offered affected customers one year of complimentary credit monitoring and identity protection.  In a big milestone for banks hoping to make Target pay for a massive data breach, a judge on Tuesday certified a class-action lawsuit against the retailer. The judge ruled that the banks will now be able to pursue their lawsuit against Target as a group, which, as Reuters reports, makes a settlement more likely. Last month, Target settled a case individually with financial institutions issuing Visa cards, although Reuters reports that it's unclear how many have already taken that settlement,... Target has agreed to pay $10 million to people affected by the breach of its systems in 2013 that saw 40 million credit and debit card numbers stolen. According to court documents, the retailer's proposed settlement — which has yet to be approved by a federal judge — could pay individuals up to $10,000 in compensation. A court hearing to approve the proposal is scheduled for Thursday. Home Depot could be the latest major company to have customer credit card data siphoned off and sold online. Security researcher Brian Krebs writes that multiple banks have said the chain might be the source of a batch of credit and debit cards currently being sold in an online black market.

The hack that cost Target and its partners more than $200 million may have caused even more damage than we thought. The New York Times is reporting that the same malware used in the attack also targeted more than a thousand other US businesses, based on a new assessment from the Secret Service. Known as Backoff malware, the attack allows hackers to monitor all the information passing through checkout computers, including customer credit cards. UPS and Supervalu have both announced they were... Five months after a data breach that compromised credit card data for 40 million customers, Target CEO Gregg Steinhafel has agreed to step down from his position running the retail giant.

Chief Financial Officer John Mulligan is expected to take over as president until a successor can be found. In March, the company's chief technology officer resigned over the...

Last year's cyberattack on US retail giant Target in which up to 40 million credit cards were compromised and up to 70 million names, email addresses, and phone numbers were stolen — has cost banks and credit unions more than $200 million.

The cost to CBA member banks has now reached $172 million, while credit unions have... Target's security staff may have been aware of vulnerabilities in the retailer's systems months before a massive breach compromised data on millions of shoppers. The Wall Street Journal reports that at least one internal analyst had called for a thorough review of the defenses around Target's payment terminals, which were later infiltrated during the sophisticated attack. That request was initially ""brushed off"" according to the Journal. It's unclear if a review was eventually granted before... Customers might have to be worried about another range of companies thanks to the Target credit card security breach. The retailer reported that the initial intrusion into its network was traced back to credentials stolen from Fazio Mechanical Services, a refrigeration, heating, and air conditioning company hired by Target.

Target says it's accelerating a program that will update its retail stores with technology designed to thwart credit card fraud. In an op-ed in The Hill, Target chief financial officer John Mulligan says the company is moving up its goal to utilize chip-enabled smart cards, and now plans to have them in stores by early 2015, which is six months earlier than originally planned. Those cards encrypt point of sale data, rendering the credit card number less useful if stolen. Mulligan notes that...

The theft of credit and debit card information for as many as 40 million Target customers, first reported by independent journalist Brian Krebs, is prompting banks to take action. JP Morgan Chase, Santander Bank, and Citibank have capped debit card purchases and ATM withdrawals for customers whose accounts may have been compromised. Some smaller banks are out-and-out canceling customers' cards. With Target already reeling from a massive hack that left up to 40 million credit and debit cards compromised, The New York Times now reports that all that data has been pouring into the black market since the break-in. With the breach taking place between Black Friday and December 15th, criminals on hundreds of illicit card-selling markets have likely had access to consumer information for weeks to date. Retailers are an appealing target for hackers during the holidays, and Target may be learning that lesson the hard way. According to Krebs on Security, the US retail giant is investigating a major breach that could potentially involve ""millions"" of customer credit and debit card records. The sophisticated hack reportedly took place over several weeks — starting on Black Friday and possibly extending all the way through December 15th — and is said to involve ""nearly all"" Target stores in the...",0.48184828097984456,0.5181517190201554,0.8535987129090578,1738,5.2922899884925201,722,6.6523545706371188,0,0,US & World,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

Does he want to?  It's time for a change at the NSA. But will President Obama deliver it? After former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden leaked documents showing the agency was engaged in widespread and often unchecked surveillance of phone and internet activity, calls to reform America's top spy organization have come from all corners.   This week, we find out whether those calls will be answered — but unfortunately, early reports from Washington insiders suggest that the president won't be making big changes.   Obama is giving a speech on Friday to address the recommendations made by an independent review panel, which he set up last year to help reform the American intelligence community. But so far, officials have been reluctant to endorse any big changes, and US lawmakers have also defended the programs, despite little to no evidence to suggest they've thwarted terrorist plots. We’ve taken a look at the reforms proposed by the review group, and we’ll be back tomorrow to see how the president's speech stacked up. The NSA’s comprehensive database of phone records was the first thing revealed by last year’s leaks, and it’s still one of the most hotly debated issues. The panel’s proposal basically shifts everything back a step: the standard for collecting information would become more like the current standards for looking up a particular number, and phone companies or some other private entity would need to keep information ready for the NSA to access quickly — though phone companies have said they don’t want to keep the records. Obama has said this plan could be feasible, and there are bills addressing it in both houses of Congress. The reform panel has insisted that they’re only suggesting a ""change in approach,"" but moving metadata out of the government’s direct control is a step away from the laissez-faire system the FISA court has authorized so far. Instead of collecting phone records in a central database, leave it in the hands of phone companies or another private third party Each piece of information the NSA collects must be relevant to a national security investigation As a general rule, ""the government should not be permitted to collect and store all mass, undigested, non-public personal information."" National security letters have actually gotten less attention since the NSA leaks, but the subpoenas, which don’t require court approval and come with a gag order that prevents recipients from revealing their existence, are still a major issue for privacy advocates. Investigations have revealed that the FBI has widely abused national security letters, and the letters as they stand now have been ruled unconstitutional by a district court. The review panel recommends significant reforms: subjecting NSLs to judicial oversight, tightening the scope, and making gag orders harder to get. The USA FREEDOM Act, the bill meant to dismantle the NSA’s phone records database, also proposes reforms to the national security letter system. But FBI director James Comey has pushed back heavily on the reform group’s recommendations, saying that judicial review would cripple a ""very important"" national security investigation tool, although he indicated willingness to compromise on changes to the gag orders. Letters should have to go through a court instead of being managed almost purely by the FBI NSLs must be ""reasonable in focus, scope, and breadth,"" subject to the same limits on keeping and distributing information as the court-managed Section 215 law Unless a court says it would pose a significant risk, recipients shouldn’t be banned from talking about an NSL; if they are, the order should expire within 180 days unless renewed Section 702 allows the intelligence community to sweep up emails, social media data, and other information for long-term storage, so long as the information is confined to non-US citizens outside the US. This rule, however, doesn’t seem to have been followed religiously by the NSA: the FISA court chided it in 2011 for apparently accidentally collecting thousands of purely domestic communications a year. The review group insists that the NSA keep as little American data as possible and reassure non-Americans that operatives can only target them under narrow circumstances and strict supervision. If any information about a US citizen is collected under a law for non-American surveillance, it should be purged immediately unless it has foreign intelligence value If data from a US person is kept, it shouldn’t be used as evidence in any case against them, and the government can’t specifically search for communications involving a particular US person Non-US persons should only be surveilled for national security, and the US should make clear that it’s not targeting people for political or religious beliefs and is monitoring the program as closely as possible Under the current system, FISA courts are the primary check on NSA power, overseeing and approving the bulk of the agency's data requests. To the extent that the NSA has gone too far in surveilling phone records, it's because the FISA court failed, granting warrants with unprecedented power and scope. What was meant to be oversight turned into a rubber stamp, approving nearly everything submitted to the court. The new measures are aimed at changing the culture of the FISA court, a tricky and nebulous task, but taken together, they have a good chance of restoring the court as a check on surveillance power, and potentially bringing a sorely absent sense of restraint into the NSA's requests. They're also comparatively easy reforms to make, if the President wants to make them. This post would be a citizen’s advocate, arguing against the NSA’s surveillance demands. Before now, the court’s rulings have been secret by default. The new procedure would tie FISA judges to the Supreme Court, separating the court further from the executive branch. Perhaps the biggest problem with the NSA is the lack of effective accountability for the agency. Congress and even the President seem to have been kept in the dark on key programs, while internal checks like the FISA court grew too closely aligned with the agency to offer an effective counterpoint. As a result, the NSA was given free rein over its data, with no one able to tell the agency when it had gone too far. The review panel would create new checks on that power, but the balance between secrecy and accountability is not an easy one to strike, and the bureaucratic details of the new agencies will be hugely important. The independent office woud monitor classified collection activities, and object when they seem inappropriately broad. This would give the president more of a say in the tools the NSA uses, and what it uses them for. The review panel suffered from poor timing on this one, stating that, ""we are unaware of any vulnerability created by the US Government in generally available commercial software that puts users at risk of criminal hackers or foreign governments decrypting their data."" Just a few days after the recommendations were made public, Reuters proved them wrong with hard evidence that the NSA had purposefully weakened RSA's BSafe program, in conjunction with earlier efforts to insert certify faulty standards through the NIST approval process. It's particularly troubling to the observers since it endangers anyone using cryptography on the web, including the encryption that secures webmail and online banking. If those standards were seeded with an NSA-built backdoor, they'd be vulnerable not just to the government but to any third-parties that stumbled onto the key. After inserting its own backdoors, the NSA has no credibility as an encryption authority. New efforts are needed to regain the world’s trust in American IT products. Right now, the NSA retains encrypted communications automatically, holding them as suspicious by default. Some of the most politically damaging news to come out of the Snowden docs was the revelation that the NSA had been tapping the phone of German chancellor Angela Merkel, along with more than 30 other world leaders. It's been a diplomatic disaster ever since the news was made public, with Merkel openly comparing the agency to the East German Stasi that surveilled her as a child. Still, without an agency overseeing those highly classified operations, enforcement is likely to be a problem. It’s likely the President didn’t even know the NSA was tapping the German chancellor’s phone. New reforms would require explicit approval before other world leaders could be surveilled.

Breaking News is unveiling an Apple Watch app today that'll deliver alerts on local stories and stories of interest to you. But the app also has a small experiment built in: a tip button, which will send an alert straight to the Breaking News team's publishing system. ""We’re expecting new users to tap it just for fun,"" Breaking News co-founder Cory Bergman writes in an email to The Verge, ""but over time we’re expecting more signal than noise.""  ""Over time we’re expecting more signal than noise."" As we've been seeing with other Apple Watch apps, the tip feature is super stripped down. There's nothing you can do but tap it. When you press the button, it'll send your general location to Breaking News, and that's it — there's no way to offer more information or even tell Breaking News what the story is that you're looking at. The plan is for Breaking News' team to identify when there's something important going on and then search around to see what's happening. ""This is wired right into our content management system, and it’s rather easy for us to run location searches in our tool,"" Bergman writes. Read next: Read our Apple Watch review. If the tips feature seems to be working, Bergman says that it could eventually be included in the iPhone app so that it can reach more people. That's when he thinks things could really get interesting. ""Imagine, for example, what an earthquake might look like,"" Bergman writes. ""We’re already thinking about how a cluster of tips could automatically trigger location searches for editors, making it even easier for us to detect news from social media very quickly. ...Our goal is to get faster at detecting news near our users around the world."" That's critical for Breaking News, which has been focusing on local alerts on the iPhone and Watch. By default, to spare you from the horrors of not-so-important breaking news alerts, Breaking News' app will only send you information on what's happening around you. Breaking News says that you'll get about one of those a day. You can get many more updates if you want them, but they'll only come if you follow specific subjects and stories. Unfortunately, every alert you get on your phone will come to your Watch — Apple doesn't provide an option to change that — so you'd better make sure you really want them. As a news source, Breaking News' Apple Watch app is meant to be a lot like its Twitter account: something that will give you the gist on top stories. The app will hold five stories at a time, which are supposed to be a mix of local stories, major stories, and stories you're specifically interested in. The intention is to let you catch up on news with just a few flicks. ""We’re big believers in the ideal of 'time saved' rather than 'time spent,'"" Bergman writes. ""If we’re hyper-efficient at giving people just the news that matters to them, we save them time and build loyalty in the long run."" That could be perfect for news junkies, so long as notifications don't drive them crazy first.

And the company puts a worry-free guarantee behind its Fire HD Kids Edition; break the thing at any point over the course of two years, and Amazon will replace it for free. Google doesn't offer anything like that for its Nexus tablets, nor does Android come with a built-in answer for FreeTime Unlimited.

Yes, Google Play already displays age ratings, which are a quick (but imperfect) way of weeding out inappropriate content.

With the FTC constantly breathing down the necks of Google, Apple, and Amazon to ensure child safety on mobile devices, it's not surprising to see Google in turn raising the bar here. But what do developers get in exchange for signing on? Right now, Google is only saying that participating apps will be prominently featured in ""upcoming family-focused experiences on Google Play that will help parents discover great, age-appropriate content and make more informed choices.""

Will Android perhaps offer more granular parental controls that permit only Designed for Families apps?

WinBeta has obtained screenshots of Windows 10 running on what appears to be a 7-inch device, and it simply looks like Windows Phone scaled up. While Windows 10 for 8-inch and above devices includes a desktop and full Windows, Microsoft is using the Windows Phone UI for tablets and phones that are below 8 inches. It's an early look at Windows 10 on such devices, but at the moment most of the UI doesn't take advantage of the extra screen real estate. There are exceptions, and apps like Calculator and Voice Recorder take advantage of the bigger screen by offering a three-paneled interface. Everything else is mostly just scaled up from what exists in Windows 10 for phones today, but Microsoft is planning to tweak this tablet mode to improve the Start Screen and other built-in apps. We're expecting Microsoft to detail its work on small tablets at the company's upcoming Build developers conference later this month. While there's no sign of a desktop, this version of Windows 10 will support universal apps and Bluetooth keyboards and mice. It's possible Microsoft's Windows 10 mobile work could make way for devices in future that are phone- or tablet-like, but transform into a PC when docked with relevant additional hardware.

For most people, the answers are obvious. But for Microsoft’s Surface line, it’s been a bit murky.  Microsoft’s first attempt, the Surface RT, flopped. So much so that the company had to take a $900 million hit when it failed to sell them all. Microsoft’s second stab at tablets resulted in the Surface 2 with a sleeker design and better performance. It still wasn’t easy to use on the lap, and the lack of a full Windows OS meant it was never really a laptop and never really a tablet due to a lack of touch-friendly apps.  While mistakes have been made along the way, there’s always been something charming and unique about the Surface and the fact that it’s not just an iPad clone. It’s never quite nailed what Microsoft was looking for, but there’s always been promise there, hiding underneath that kickstand. So now we have a third attempt, the Surface 3. It’s Microsoft learning from all of its mistakes and bringing lessons from the bigger Surface Pro 3 down to a smaller and cheaper $499 tablet. Because it finally uses a full version of Windows, you can now run all the full Windows apps you’d expect to use like Chrome, iTunes, and Photoshop. But is that enough? Is the third time the charm for Microsoft’s tablet / laptop hybrid? When I first looked at the Surface 3, I honestly thought it was a Surface 2 from a year and a half ago. With the same silver matte aluminum finish, it still looks beautiful, modern, and premium. Dig a little deeper and you find some subtle — but important — changes. The Surface 3 is both thinner (8.7mm) and lighter (1.37 pounds) than its predecessor, and the dimensions have changed to make this more of a tablet than ever before. There’s now a 10.8-inch display running at 1920 x 1280, which is slightly larger than the Surface 2, and a 3:2 aspect ratio finally makes it a lot more comfortable to use in portrait mode as a pure tablet. The display is bright and crisp and has great viewing angles. Surprisingly, I find the color reproduction is actually better than the Surface Pro 3, and the screen is brighter. The design still looks beautiful and modern As a tablet, the Surface 3 is still bigger, heavier, and thicker than the iPad Air 2, but you’re also getting a whole lot more. There’s a single USB 3.0 port, Mini DisplayPort, headset jack, and a microSD slot underneath the hinge of the kickstand. They’re not the only ports, though: Microsoft has swapped its magnetic charging mechanism to Micro USB which means you can use a normal phone charger to juice up the Surface 3. It also doubles as a full-size USB port if you buy the necessary adaptor. If you really want to have some fun, plug a Micro USB cable into the full-size USB and the charging port, and watch the Surface 3 charge itself. It doesn’t really, but in a quirky moment, Windows briefly says it’s charging before realizing it can’t actually redefine the laws of physics. While the Surface RT and Surface 2 were difficult to use on your lap as a laptop thanks to the limited travel of their kickstands, the Surface 3 can work at three different angles. Disappointingly, it’s not the same redesigned kickstand that the Surface Pro 3 uses, with the hinge to allow you to set it at any angle. On the Surface 3, the first angle is totally useless for the lap, and the second is only slightly better, but I found the third was the one I used the most. It’s far from ideal, though, and I found myself longing for the adjustability of the Surface Pro 3. I use my laptop in weird positions a lot, with my legs crossed, on the floor of a trade show, in the back of a cab, and many other places. Usually I just move the screen back and forth to adjust the angle and rely on the sturdy base, but with the Surface 3 I found I had to adjust the way I was sitting instead. If you use it on a desk it’s mostly fine, but it still becomes irritating if your desk doesn’t work well with one of those three angles. Part of the lap use is eased by the introduction of a new Type Cover for the Surface 3. It’s largely the same as the Surface Pro 3 version, just shrunk down for the 10-inch dimensions. It has new magnets that attach to both the bottom of the Surface and the screen so it’s a lot sturdier. This is a great change, and it really makes a big difference for lap use. It features a full keyboard that’s backlit, and I enjoyed typing away on it for brief periods of time. It’s still nowhere near as nice as a real, full laptop keyboard, but it’s close enough for me. Microsoft is clearly looking toward Windows 10 with the Surface 3, as the keyboard ditches the shortcuts for charms, settings, and other Windows 8 features for PrtScn, insert, and screen brightness controls. You’ll need to buy a Type Cover separately for $129.99 as Microsoft still doesn’t bundle the keyboard. While the trackpad has improved, it’s still far too small. I complain about PC trackpads all the time, and I wish Microsoft and other OEMs would take note that they’re simply not doing a good enough job. This is the primary input mechanism if you’re using the Surface 3 as a laptop, and it spoils the experience if it mis-clicks or starts dragging files around randomly in File Explorer. The Surface pen is accurate and natural to use A new way to interact with the Surface 3 is with a pen. While this has traditionally been part of Microsoft’s Surface Pro offering, the same pen from the Surface Pro 3 now works with this cheaper model. It’s functionally identical, and it’s really accurate and natural to write notes in OneNote, or just draw something in Fresh Paint. Like the Surface Pro 3, you can click the cap on the pen at any time (even when the screen is off) and it will launch OneNote immediately so you can start taking notes. It still feels like Windows needs some work to fully accommodate the pen in a more natural way, but using it inside certain apps makes me want to use it more. I just wish I could stow the pen away inside the Surface, but instead there’s a weird loop you can attach to the Surface or the cover. Unfortunately, this pen doesn’t come in the box like it does with the Surface Pro 3. You’ll need to spend $49.99 to purchase it separately. But the biggest change to the Surface 3 is what’s inside. Microsoft has opted for an Intel Atom x7 processor, which means the Surface 3 can now run a full version of Windows 8.1 with support for traditional desktop apps. This isn’t the same Atom processor from the dreadful days of netbooks, but the performance still isn’t great compared to $499 PCs. I’ve used iTunes, Chrome, Photoshop, and a number of other Windows desktop apps, and most of them run just fine at a basic level until you start to push things further. Steam is the big exception, as most of the modern games just won’t run well at all. That’s not really surprising, as this isn’t exactly designed to be a gaming laptop for those titles, but if you want to play some basic mobile games from the Windows Store, it should handle those okay. During my days of testing I found that the Surface 3 just about got me through a day of work before needing to be plugged in. It stayed alive for 7 hours and 7 minutes in our battery rundown test, which is only 40 minutes shy of the Surface Pro 3. I’d expect a little more from the Surface 3, but for many it will be enough. I have found that the Surface 3 is pretty aggressive at dimming the display or putting itself to sleep, even when it’s plugged in. If you’re charging and stop using the Surface 3, then it will sleep after just two minutes, so I’d regularly go and grab a drink and return to a black screen. It resumes instantly, but I’m not sure I need my laptop (or tablet) to turn off so quickly when it’s charging. Nearly enough battery for a working day One of the irritating parts of the previous Surface models is the battery drain when it’s not in use. I would regularly come back to my Surface RT or Surface 2 and find it had an empty battery, but the Surface 3 is much better. I found that it drains around 2–3 percent of battery over a 12-hour period without entering hibernation mode. That’s pretty impressive, and I haven’t worried about just putting it on standby and in my bag ever since. During all this time of battery testing and running apps or games, I never found that the Surface 3 got warm. There’s no fan, no noise, and no heat, just like a tablet should be. Though it will be upgraded to Windows 10, the Surface 3 ships with Windows 8.1. The fullscreen apps and awkward navigation with a keyboard and trackpad on the Surface 3 is still a frustrating experience in Windows 8.1, but as a pure tablet, I still enjoy the gestures and the Start Screen. It’s the mix that Windows 8.1 doesn’t really get right, and it underlines the Surface as a product. It’s a mash up, a weird combination of legacy and new. A laptop that isn’t really a laptop, and a tablet that’s nearly a tablet but doesn’t have the touch-friendly apps to back it up. The Windows Store is at a standstill, and I’m increasingly finding it hard to discover any meaningful finger-friendly apps. StaffPad surprised me last week as a stunning Windows app, but it’s designed more for the Surface pen than it is for touch. It's a beautiful and confused machine Microsoft has this same lack of apps issue on Windows Phone, and it feels like the company is waiting on Windows 10 as its hope for developer interest. Windows 10 will be a free upgrade for the Surface 3, and it should fix a lot of the weird inconsistencies of using this as a hybrid laptop and tablet, but it’s not clear if it will lead to more touch-friendly apps for Windows. It also won’t address the fact that the Surface 3 doesn’t really know what it is. It’s a beautiful and confused machine. It’s fun to use, and it’s really sleek and pretty, but I’m not sure I’d use it everyday. I love the fact that it’s more versatile than an iPad, and I can immediately transition from playing a game to writing an article for The Verge without switching machines, but it’s not good enough in either mode for me to justify giving up separate devices. At its core, the Surface 3 is a shrunken-down version of the Surface Pro 3 that’s cheaper and less powerful. For many, the $499 price is attractive, but once you’ve added the Type Cover, it’s nearly $630 — and that’s just the base model. I reach for my Surface Pro 3 a lot at home because there’s something about it I just love, but I always travel with a laptop. The Surface 3 won’t change this for me. There ought to be a market for the Surface, because having the power of touch, keyboard, and pen in one single thin and light device is really compelling. But even three years into this experiment, there are just compromises I’m not willing to make, especially on the laptop side. Unless you’re on a tight budget, I would just recommend a laptop or at least the Surface Pro 3 with its adjustable hinge if you really want the pen and touch input. It's time for a Surface laptop Perhaps that’s just the story of the Surface. It’s not the ""tablet that can replace your laptop"" so much as it’s a tablet that wants to be a laptop, and maybe it’s just time Microsoft made a Surface laptop. That’s really what the Surface wants to be.",0.4048419925016582,0.5951580074983418,0.1457207876805867,2088,4.490421455938697,769,5.8959687906371911,0,22,"Microsoft, Tech, Review",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

On this week's episode of What's Tech?, The Verge's Executive Editor and resident smoker Dieter Bohn explains vaping. Is it healthier than smoking? Can it be used to fight nicotine addictions? Is vaping a sport? We'll get to the heart of a potentially unhealthy habit. Subscribe to What's Tech? on iTunes, listen on SoundCloud, or subscribe via RSS. And be sure to follow us on Twitter.

The tagline for this year's Worldwide Developers Conference is ""the epicenter of change,"" and that's a good explanation for why this event is so popular. Like last year, Apple has actually switched over to a lottery process for selling tickets — rather than offering them first come, first serve — because their demand is so high. The event will once again be held at the Moscone Center in San Francisco. Developer events will run through June 12th, and this time around, they'll actually stream live to those offsite.  Will a new Apple TV be introduced?  As usual, Apple is vague about what we can expect to hear about at WWDC, giving its regular statement that we'll see ""the future of iOS and OS X."" That's pretty much a given, though. Each year, WWDC kicks off with a keynote presentation from Apple's top executives, who usually run through sales and distribution highlights and then introduce major software updates. Hardware debuts are not as common at WWDC as they once were — for a while, it was where new iPhones were introduced — but they're certainly not out of the question. A couple years ago, Apple used the stage to preview its long-awaited Mac Pro update. This year, it's been reported that Apple will introduce a new version of the Apple TV at the conference. It would be a logical place for the streaming box's introduction: the new model is supposed to include support for third-party apps, and Apple's developers conference is the obvious place to announce that if it wants to get people coding. Developers interested in attending will be able to apply for tickets from today through Friday at 10AM in California. Those chosen will be lucky enough to have the chance to pay $1,599 to attend. One final, important note to attendees: selfie sticks are banned this year on the Moscone grounds.

Now, more than half of them have abruptly vanished. Last week, China's Ministry of Water Resources announced the results of a three-year survey of the country’s waterways, revealing startling declines in water supply. According to the census, there were 22,909 rivers in China as of 2011, each covering an area of at least 100 square kilometers. That marks a decrease of about 28,000 from the government's previous estimates, raising fears among environmentalists and putting Beijing on the defensive. China's longest rivers, the Yangtze and the Yellow, have each seen declining water levels in recent years, but the government's survey — its most comprehensive to date — may shed new light on the breadth and gravity of the country's crisis.  According to the South China Morning Post, officials attributed the decline to global warming and outdated mapping techniques, saying previous estimates were based on incomplete topographical maps from the 1950s. Experts, meanwhile, say there are more direct factors at play — namely, explosive economic development and poor environmental stewardship. Ma Jun, director of the Beijing-based Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs, acknowledges that updated mapping techniques could explain some discrepancies in river estimates, though he notes that the government's findings corroborate those from independent studies. ""pollution is destroying the limited resources we have"" ""Our research has shown that in some areas, especially in north China, rivers are drying up or turning into seasonal rivers,"" Ma said in a phone interview with The Verge. There are several explanations for this phenomenon, including deforestation and, to a less certain extent, climate change, though Ma says the two primary catalysts are pollution and overpopulation. Together, they form a potentially disastrous combination. China's mushrooming population has added extra strain to its limited water supply, while the country's rampant industrialization has left many rivers contaminated. ""At the moment, pollution discharge is destroying the limited clean resources we have,"" Ma said. The extent of China's pollution problem was laid bare in grisly fashion last month, when more than 12,000 dumped pig carcasses washed ashore in Shanghai and Jiaxing. Agricultural and industrial waste has had a pronounced human impact, as well, contaminating water supplies in so-called ""cancer villages"" — a moniker for areas with particularly high cancer rates. Dead pigs and cancer villages   These incidents have drawn greater attention to China's water crisis, while reviving concerns over the environmental costs of unfettered economic development. Chinese lawmakers, however, have been grappling with these issues for decades. China's modern water management system dates back to the 1960s, when a series of devastating floods forced Mao Zedong to commission an array of dams, reservoirs, and spillways. Mao's infrastructure helped prevent floods, but it also created ecological imbalances by blocking rivers that once flowed into the North China Plain. As a result, lakes and rivers in the region began drying up, and farmers began depleting well supplies. Population growth has only compounded China’s supply issues. According to a 2006 study from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), China's water use has increased more than fivefold since 1949, forcing the government to take even more drastic measures.  In 2008, China unveiled the Three Gorges Dam — a massive hydropower project that the country heralded as a marvel of engineering. Today, it's the largest hydropower structure in the world, though it has had disastrous ecological and social effects, resulting in deadly landslides and the displacement of an estimated 1.4 million people. The government openly acknowledged these pitfalls in 2011, but it remains intent on building the South-North Water Transfer Project — an even grander undertaking that the New York Times described as ""China's most ambitious attempt to subjugate nature."" When completed, the $62 billion initiative will divert water from China's already drought-ravaged southern region to the northern Yellow and Hai rivers. ""An emergency relief effort"" Ma describes the Water Transfer Project as ""an emergency relief effort,"" citing the dire situation in China's northeast region, though he doesn't see it as a viable long-term solution. ""They could run out of water without this project,"" he said, ""but even the current volume of redirected water likely won't be enough to keep up with demand."" Instead, Ma and others say China should focus on controlling demand and regulating pollution, rather than re-allocating its water supply. Xavier Leflaive, head of the water team at the OECD's Environment Directorate, says China should implement market-based reforms to encourage more responsible water usage, while phasing out fertilizer subsidies to mitigate agricultural runoff. He acknowledges that China isn't the only country facing these issues; global water demand is expected to increase 55 percent over the next three decades, and rapidly developing countries like India have faced similar crises. But Beijing's unique economic and social developments add an extra layer of urgency. ""This global trend is exacerbated in China by the speed and scale of urbanization and economic development, and by a lack of strong monitoring, inspection and enforcement capabilities,"" Leflaive said in an email to The Verge. ""This lack is limiting the effectiveness of otherwise sound policies, laws and regulations."" China has implemented tougher regulations on water usage and pollutants — the so-called ""three red lines"" — though it remains to be seen whether they can be enforced across an expansive, and fast-growing economy. ""punish offenders with no mercy and enforce the law with an iron fist"" The good news is that the Chinese government seems willing to take a harder stance on environmental stewardship. In the past, Beijing has scoffed at calls to control its greenhouse emissions, arguing that it shouldn't be punished for its own economic prosperity. But Premier Li Keqiang has adopted a more environmentally conscious tone in recent weeks, vowing to be more transparent about his country's ecological issues. ""We must take the steps in advance,"" Li said last month, ""rather than hurry to handle these issues when they have caused a disturbance in society."" The premier has also promised to enforce current regulations on pollution, as he explained at his debut press conference in March.  ""This government will show even greater resolve and take more vigorous efforts to clean up such pollution,"" Li said. ""We need to face the situation and punish offenders with no mercy and enforce the law with an iron fist.""",0.4830032613094145,0.5169967386905855,0.877811934171229,1067,5.5248359887535141,606,6.8036303630363033,0,0,"Policy & Law, Science, Politics, Report",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Y.H. Percival Zhang and his team accomplished this through the use of xylose, the second most prevalent sugar in plants. ""Our new process could help end our dependence on fossil fuels,"" Zhang said of the finding. Hydrogen energy has the potential to become a booming industry, but as Forbes points out, logistical challenges have hindered its progression into a low-cost, widely available power source. By tapping into xylose — found in every plant — researchers have made it over one hurdle; they've found a remarkably efficient way of producing hydrogen gas. The conventional (and wasteful) method of doing so involves reforming natural gas, a process that sacrifices some of the energy stored in the valuable resource.  Zhang's research is still preliminary, however, and it will be at least three years before it's ready for primetime. Further, other challenges remain when it comes to establishing hydrogen fuel cells as a means of powering automobile. Owing to issues with storage and distribution, former Obama administration Energy Secretary Steven Chu deemed it ""unlikely"" that hydrogen energy would see wide adoption anytime soon. But Virginia Tech's process could help move things closer to the goal post.

That's the result of a new study of cocaine-addicted lab rodents published today by US researchers working with the National Institute on Drug Abuse. But the scientists behind it think that their results could be easily and quickly replicated in humans using a less intrusive therapy that involves stimulating the brain with magnets on the outside of the skull, and they're aiming to get human trials going by the end of the year.  ""That's the most the exciting part for me,"" said Antonello Bonci, a research director at the National Institute of Drug Abuse who led the study, in a phone interview with The Verge. ""Generally there is a 15-year-lag between the day you discover something and when you can try it in humans."" The research relies on similarities between rat and human brains The promising new results of Bonci and his colleagues' research relies on similarities between rat and human brains, specifically an area of the rat brain known as the prelimbic cortex, which in humans is called the anterior cingulate cortex. Previous studies of human cocaine addicts have found that this area suffers from diminished activity. The researchers wanted to see if stimulating this region in addicted rats would be enough to stop cravings for cocaine. The researchers genetically engineered the brains of a group of about 100 rats to respond to light. They took a handful of the bunch and trained them to press levers that would administer cocaine on demand. Then the researchers implanted fiber optics into these rats' brains and beamed a low-intensity laser from several feet away. While the laser was shining, rats didn't press the levers. In non-addicted rats, deactivating this part of the brain caused them to seek out cocaine. They haven't yet tested it out on other drugs, but are looking to do so in the near future. ""When we give that certain level of activity to the prefrontal cortex, the desire to take cocaine is gone."" The therapy doesn't need light to work, just a form of energetic stimulation. So researchers think that transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), a less invasive procedure involving placing magnets on the side of the skull, which is already being used today to treat symptoms of depression in humans, could be adapted to help cocaine addicts. Still, there are some big unanswered questions, such as ""how many times and for how long"" the treatment needs to be administered to completely eliminate cravings for the drug. ""We don't know that the addiction is cured,"" Bonci said. ""All we know is that when we give that certain level of activity to the prefrontal cortex, the desire to take cocaine is gone. We can't prove that it's gone forever.""",0.49895911293195705,0.501040887068043,0.8777793323390813,472,4.9046610169491522,265,5.8528301886792455,0,0,Science,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

A new study by MIT researchers demonstrated all of these capacities and more for ionic thrusters and now at least one major aerospace company, Lockheed Martin, has said it's investigating the technology.  ""I think UAVs would be the most likely initial application if [ionic thrusters] work,"" said the lead researcher in the study, MIT aerospace professor Steven Barrett, in an email to The Verge. Ionic thrusters for aircraft work by generating a high-voltage electrical field that strips electrons from air molecules, ""ionizing"" them and pushing them away behind an aircraft as ionic wind, to move the craft forward. Scientists and hobbyists have been tinkering with small, lightweight model planes using these kinds of propulsion systems since the 1960s. The technology uses no moving parts and is almost completely silent. It hasn't come to full-size planes, though, due to power concerns. ""I think UAVs would be the most likely initial application if they work."" But scientists at MIT's department of aeronautics have built a working prototype (pictured above) that suggests the technology is more feasible than previously assumed, generating far more thrust (110 newtons per kilowatt of power) than a comparable jet engine (2 newtons per kilowatt). ""You could imagine all sorts of military or security benefits to having a silent propulsion system with no infrared signature,"" said Steven Barrett, the lead author of the study published today in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society. Indeed, Lockheed Martin is already expressing an interest, with an executive telling MIT News ""there are still unanswered questions, but because they seem so efficient, it’s definitely worth investigating further."" ""It could be useful in exploration of other planets."" Barrett told The Verge there are still major hurdles to overcome before aircraft ionic thrusters are able to be commercialized, namely a large enough power supply for their electrical field, and a way to retain efficiency at higher speeds. ""At reasonable flight speeds [about 560 miles per hour] the efficiency does decrease, but still looks promising,"" he wrote in an email. Also, because it uses air molecules,  ""this kind of propulsion only works in an atmosphere,"" Barrett said.

Some 1.2 million premature deaths in the country can be attributed to the outdoor air quality in 2010, a loss of some 25 million healthy years, according to the Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD), published by The Lancet in December. The New York Times reports that ""ambient particulate matter pollution"" was the number four cause of death in the country, behind dietary risks, high blood pressure, and smoking.    ""The energy consumption in China is rising dramatically."" Speaking to NPR, Robert O’Keefe of the Health Effects Institute in Boston explained that the huge rise in air pollution is a direct result of the fast pace of industrialization. ""Cars are being added and trucks are being added to the streets in major cities at record numbers. Power plants burn significant amounts of very low-grade coal, and the energy consumption in China is rising dramatically,"" he explained. But while the effects of rapid industrialization might be most keenly felt in China, its citizens aren’t the only ones to be feeling the effects of air pollution. According to the GBD, the number was around 3.2 million worldwide in 2010, which would make China’s figure roughly 40 percent of the total.

Topics come less than a year after Imgur introduced tagging to its pictures, another move designed to make it easier to search through millions of uploaded images. Sam Gerstenzang, Imgur's director of product, says the site is also refining its tagging process at the same time as it introduces topics.

Following a landmark decision by a federal appeals court to strike down key parts of the FCC's Open Internet rules, internet service providers and telecommunications companies are scrambling to reassure customers that the internet — as they know it — will continue to work as advertised. A barrage of companies including AT&T, Verizon, Comcast, and others have issued public statements that attempt to calm, and otherwise reassure customers the internet will continue to be ""open,"" ""vibrant,"" and that people will have ""unfettered"" access to all (legal) parts of it. Those promises could be reevaluated later on down the line, something that makes these statements a time capsule if, and when, any future policy changes are made. Verizon — the key instigator against the FCC's rules — spun the opinion, saying the decision will result in ""more"" innovation and ""choices"" for consumers: ... Today's decision will not change consumers' ability to access and use the Internet as they do now. The court's decision will allow more room for innovation, and consumers will have more choices to determine for themselves how they access and experience the Internet. Verizon has been and remains committed to the open Internet that provides consumers with competitive choices and unblocked access to lawful websites and content when, where, and how they want. This will not change in light of the court's decision. We look forward to working with the FCC and Congress to keep the Internet a hub of innovation without the need for unnecessary new regulations that seek to manage the explosive dynamism of the Internet. Jim Cicconi, AT&T's senior executive vice president of external and legislative affairs said that the company is still ""committed to protect an open Internet,"" and that its service ""won't change."" He also added that the company's backed the FCC on the rules since 2004 : AT&T has been committed to the open Internet since our endorsement of the FCC's statement of Internet freedoms in 2004. We worked constructively to help craft the FCC's net neutrality rule, and testified in support of it in the Congress. As the FCC assesses the impact of today's court decision, AT&T can assure all of our customers and stakeholders that our commitment to protect and maintain an open Internet will not change. In a statement, Time Warner Cable said changes to the FCC rules or not, TWC still wants to give customers ""unfettered access"" to the internet: Since pioneering the development of high-speed broadband service in the late 1990s, Time Warner Cable has been committed to providing its customers the best service possible, including unfettered access to the web content and services of their choice. This commitment, which long precedes the FCC rules, will not be affected by today's court decision. Comcast executive vice president David Cohen noted that the company still has a multi-year deal in place to ""abide by"" the Open Internet rules, but that it will also be working with the FCC on future regulation: Comcast has consistently supported the Commission's Open Internet Order as an appropriate balance of protection of consumer interests while not interfering with companies' network management and engineering decisions.  As a result, we agreed in the NBCUniversal Transaction Order to abide by the Open Internet rules for seven years even if the rules were modified by the courts.  We remain comfortable with that commitment because we have not - and will not - block our customers' ability to access lawful Internet content, applications, or services.  Comcast's customers want an open and vibrant Internet, and we are absolutely committed to deliver that experience. We are committed to work with Chairman Wheeler and the Commission to play a constructive role in finding an appropriate regulatory balance going forward that will continue to allow the Internet to flourish.  Given the DC Circuit Court of Appeals holding that the FCC has jurisdiction in the broadband arena to preserve and facilitate the innovation that has driven the Internet, we are optimistic that the Commission can accomplish this result while avoiding inappropriate common carrier regulation. The CTIA, a consortium of wireless companies, said it's still going over the details of the ruling. But CTIA chief executive Steve Largent noted that companies make decisions on service based on the market, and not legislation: While we are still reviewing the text of the opinion, today's court decision does nothing to temper CTIA members' long-standing commitment to an open Internet and a vibrant wireless ecosystem because that's what wireless customers demand. In fact, the United States leads the world in mobile broadband specifically because investment and innovation have been driven by the needs of customers, not by regulations or court decisions. Policymakers should exercise caution before adding any additional regulation to this area, particularly given the fundamental technical and operational challenges facing mobile broadband providers and the robust competition to attract and retain customers.

As a result of insufficient parental controls, the company is required to refund customers who have been billed for faulty charges, paying out a total of $32.5 million to 37,000 different customers. Apple will also be required to change its billing practice ""to ensure that it has obtained express, informed consent from consumers before charging them for items sold in mobile apps."" In one case, a girl spent $2,600 in 15 minutes According to a companywide letter from Apple CEO Tim Cook, posted by 9to5mac, Apple solicited the claims after hearing complaints of in-app purchases that occurred without a parent's permission. In response, the company emailed every iOS user that had made an in-app purchase in an app designed for children, 28 million accounts in total. Of those 28 million, 37,000 responded with claims and were reimbursed for their purchase. Despite the sweeping nature of the FTC settlement, Cook told employees it ""does not require us to do anything we weren’t already going to do."" The FTC took particular issue with Apple's 15-minute window for charging, in which a single password entry can be used to authorize unlimited charges during the following 15 minutes of usage. FTC Chairwoman Edith Martinez said in one case, a girl spent more than $2,600 in that 15-minute window, using the app ""Tap Pet Hotel."" Martinez said the issue was not the duration of time, but the fact that parents approving in-app purchasing have no way of knowing the full extent of the charges they could incur during that window. The settlement requires Apple to modify its billing practices to allow for more explicit consent, with new safeguards in place no later than March 31st of this year. Tim Cook's letter to employees is reproduced below. I want to let you know that Apple has entered into a consent decree with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. We have been negotiating with the FTC for several months over disclosures about the in-app purchase feature of the App Store, because younger customers have sometimes been able to make purchases without their parents’ consent. I know this announcement will come as a surprise to many of you since Apple has led the industry by making the App Store a safe place for customers of all ages. From the very beginning, protecting children has been a top priority for the App Store team and everyone at Apple. The store is thoughtfully curated, and we hold app developers to Apple’s own high standards of security, privacy, usefulness and decency, among others. The parental controls in iOS are strong, intuitive and customizable, and we’ve continued to add ways for parents to protect their children. These controls go far beyond the features of other mobile device and OS makers, most of whom don’t even review the apps they sell to children. When we introduced in-app purchases in 2009, we proactively offered parents a way to disable the function with a single switch. When in-app purchases were enabled and a password was entered to download an app, the App Store allowed purchases for 15 minutes without requiring a password. The 15-minute window had been there since the launch of the App Store in 2008 and was aimed at making the App Store easy to use, but some younger customers discovered that it also allowed them to make in-app purchases without a parent’s approval. We heard from some customers with children that it was too easy to make in-app purchases, so we moved quickly to make improvements. We even created additional steps in the purchasing process, because these steps are so helpful to parents. Last year, we set out to refund any in-app purchase which may have been made without a parent’s permission. We wanted to reach every customer who might have been affected, so we sent emails to 28 million App Store customers – anyone who had made an in-app purchase in a game designed for kids. When some emails bounced, we mailed the parents postcards. In all, we received 37,000 claims and we will be reimbursing each one as promised. A federal judge agreed with our actions as a full settlement and we felt we had made things right for everyone. Then, the FTC got involved and we faced the prospect of a second lawsuit over the very same issue. It doesn’t feel right for the FTC to sue over a case that had already been settled. To us, it smacked of double jeopardy. However, the consent decree the FTC proposed does not require us to do anything we weren’t already going to do, so we decided to accept it rather than take on a long and distracting legal fight. The App Store is one of Apple’s most important innovations, and it’s wildly popular with our customers around the world because they know they can trust Apple. You and your coworkers have helped Apple earn that trust, which we value and respect above all else. Apple is a company full of disruptive ideas and innovative people, who are also committed to upholding the highest moral, legal and ethical standards in everything we do. As I’ve said before, we believe technology can serve humankind’s deepest values and highest aspirations. As Apple continues to grow, there will inevitably be scrutiny and criticism along our journey. We don’t shy away from these kinds of questions, because we are confident in the integrity of our company and our coworkers.

That was the overwhelming message delivered to the FCC by the DC Circuit yesterday when it ruled to vacate the agency’s net neutrality rules. The FCC had tried to impose so-called “common carrier” regulations on broadband providers without officially classifying them as utilities subject to those types of rules, and the court rejected that sleight of hand. Most observers saw the decision coming months, if not years, ago; Cardozo Law School’s Susan Crawford called the FCC’s position a “house of cards.”  I’ll be a little more clear: it’s bullshit. Bullshit built on cowardice and political expediency instead of sound policymaking. Bullshit built on the wrong words. Since 1980, the FCC has divided communication services into basic and enhanced categories; phone lines, with their ""pure"" transmission, are basic, while services like web hosting, which process information, are enhanced. Only basic services are subject to what are known as common carrier laws, which stop carriers from discriminating against or refusing service to customers. Over time, those categories matured and gained new names: the basic services were tightly regulated under Title II of the Telecommunications Act as ""telecommunications services,"" while enhanced services were regulated under the much weaker Title I as ""information services.""   At its simplest, net neutrality holds that just as phone companies can’t check who’s on the line and selectively block or degrade the service of callers, everyone on the internet should start on roughly the same footing: ISPs shouldn’t slow down services, block legal content, or let companies pay for their data to get to customers faster than a competitor’s. In this case, we’re also talking about a very specific policy: the Open Internet Order, which the FCC adopted in 2010. Under the order, wired and wireless broadband providers must disclose how they manage network traffic. Wired providers can’t block lawful content, software, services, or devices, and wireless providers can’t block websites or directly competing apps. And wired providers can’t ""unreasonably discriminate"" in transmitting information. The FCC has been trying in one way or another to implement net neutrality rules since 2005, but this latest defeat is the second time its principles have been put to the test and failed. The FCC adopts its ""Computer II"" policies, establishing separate rules for ""basic"" and ""enhanced"" communications services. Basic services are subject to ""common carrier"" rules, which stop them from blocking or discriminating against traffic over their networks. The new Telecommunications Act creates more specific terms. Basic services are now called Title II ""telecommunications carriers,"" which simply transmit information, and enhanced services that offer interactive features are classified as Title I ""information service providers."" DSL companies are classified as carriers, while AOL-style internet portals fall under information services. After legal confusion, cable broadband is defined as an information service, effectively exempting the most popular consumer internet providers from common carrier rules. A court decision upholds the FCC's definitions, but DSL and wireless are reclassified as information services. The FCC establishes its first set of ""open internet"" rules, four principles that grant users the right to access any lawful content and use any devices and services they want on a network. Comcast is found to be slowing down BitTorrent traffic, hurting customers’ ability to use the service. The FCC requires Comcast to change its policy, but Comcast files suit to overturn the order, arguing that the FCC has no authority to censure it. FCC chair Julius Genachowski proposes two new open internet principles: non-discrimination, which would stop carriers from slowing particular services, and transparency, which would require them to make their network management practices public. His idea is to take specific rules that govern Title II telecommunications carriers and apply them to Title I information service providers. After its defeat in court, the FCC revises its standards and releases Genachowski’s Open Internet Order, justifying it as a necessary move to promote broadband adoption. Broadband companies are still classified as information service providers. The Open Internet rules go into effect, barring wired broadband providers from blocking, slowing, or prioritizing traffic in most cases. In a compromise, wireless carriers were exempted from these rules. Verizon and MetroPCS appeal the order. The DC court once again rules against the FCC, striking down its anti-blocking and anti-discrimination requirements in an almost complete victory for Verizon. The court says that the FCC has proven that broadband providers represent a threat to internet openness, but that the government can’t impose common carrier rules on information service providers. In 2002, the FCC made what would turn out to be a pivotal mistake. Instead of stating the blindingly obvious — internet service is a utility just like landline phone service — the FCC tried to appease the out-of-control corporate egos of behemoths like Verizon and Comcast by pretending internet providers were special and classifying them as ""information service providers"" and not ""telecommunications carriers."" The wrong words. Then, once everyone was wearing the nametag they wanted, the FCC tried to impose common carrier-style telecommunications regulations on them anyway. The FCC’s first attempt to regulate broadband providers consisted of four ""open internet"" principles adopted in 2005. They were meant to ""encourage broadband deployment and preserve and promote the open and interconnected nature of the public internet"" by stopping companies like AT&T and Comcast from blocking devices or services. In 2007 the house of cards started tumbling down. Comcast customers found that the company was drastically slowing BitTorrent speeds and the FCC took action, slapping it with an order to stop the throttling and tell subscribers exactly how it managed their traffic. Comcast agreed to the plan, but it took the whole issue to court, making a point that would come up again and again: the FCC’s justification for the open internet principles were vague at best. The issue was so contentious and so important to the titans of the internet and media industries that net neutrality became an issue in the 2008 presidential election, with Obama issuing his support for an open internet. Even with Obama’s support, Comcast beat the FCC in 2010 when Judge David Tatel — the same judge who wrote yesterday’s net neutrality decision — found that the agency lacked the authority to enforce the open internet principles because Comcast was an information service provider, not a telecommunications provider. The FCC had used the wrong words. The timing could hardly have been worse. Newly appointed FCC chairman Julius Genachowski had just started work on a revamped version of the open internet rules, adding two principles that directly addressed Comcast's actions: companies couldn't discriminate against traffic by slowing it beyond what was necessary to keep a network running, and they had to be transparent about any reasonable management. When the Comcast decision came down in early 2010, the FCC scrambled to build a stronger framework under Title II, but Genachowski backed down under enormous pressure from major service providers and instead reached consensus with the industry. He declined to reclassify broadband as a telecommunications service and further compromised by exempting mobile providers from the regulations. The process resulted in the Open Internet Order, which enshrined transparency and non-discrimination but was still built on the wrong words. Critics like Susan Crawford referred to the plan as ""once more, with feeling."" Comcast was happy, but Verizon wasn’t; it took the FCC to court once again. And as we saw yesterday, Genachowski’s Open Internet Order didn't stand up any better. No matter how the FCC defends its rules, net neutrality regulations for information services look a whole lot like common carrier rules for telecommunications providers —  and all Verizon had to do was point that out. That’s it. That’s the whole mistake. The wrong words. The entire American internet experience is now at risk of turning into a walled garden of corporate control because the FCC chickened out and picked the wrong words in 2002, and the court called them on it twice over. You used the wrong words. The court even agreed with the FCC’s policy goals — after a bitterly fought lawsuit and thousands of pages of high-priced arguments from Verizon and its supporters, Judge Tatel was convinced that ""broadband providers represent a threat to internet openness and could act in ways that would ultimately inhibit the speed and extent of future broadband deployment."" Too bad you used the wrong fucking words. What happens now is entirely dependent on whether the FCC’s new chairman, Tom Wheeler, has the courage to stand up and finally say the right words — that broadband access is a telecommunications service that should be regulated just like landline phones. He need only convince two additional FCC commissioners to agree with him, and the argument is simple: consumers already perceive internet service as a utility, and it’s advertised only on the commodity basis of speed and price. But the political cost will be incredible. National Cable and Telecommunications Association CEO Michael Powell — the former FCC chairman who issued the 2005 open internet rules — has said that any attempts to reclassify broadband as a common carrier telecommunications service will be ""World War III."" That’s not an idle threat: the NCTA is a powerful force in the industry, and it counts major companies like Comcast and Time Warner Cable as members. That’s a lot of influence to throw around — not only does Comcast lobby and donate freely, but it also owns NBCUniversal, giving it the kind of power over the American political conversation few corporations have even dared to dream about. Put enough pressure on Congress, and they’ll start making noise about the FCC’s budget — a budget Wheeler needs to hold his upcoming spectrum auctions, which have until now been the cornerstone of his regulatory agenda. So, this is going to be chaos. All you’re going to hear from now on is that net neutrality proponents want to ""regulate the internet,"" a conflation so insidious it boggles the mind. Comcast and Time Warner Cable and Verizon are not the internet. We are the internet — the people. It is us who make things like Reddit and Facebook and Twitter vibrant communities of unfiltered conversation. It is us who wield the unaffected market power that picks Google over Bing and Amazon over everything. It’s us who turned Netflix from a DVD-by-mail company into a video giant that uses a third of the US internet’s bandwidth each night. And it is us who can quit stable but boring corporate jobs to start new businesses like The Verge and Vox Media without anyone’s permission. Comcast and Verizon are just pipes. The dumber the better. It’s time to start using the right words.

This type of video is basically a ""teaser teaser,"" since it's teasing a soon-to-be-released movie teaser (which will eventually be followed by an even longer movie trailer). It's actually the second teaser teaser that Marvel has released in the past 24 hours. Yesterday, we saw one for Avengers: Age of Ultron. Today, it's pulling the same stunt for Ant-Man. This is how you build hype, and while it's more than a little ridiculous to be staring into an ""ant-sized"" preview of the Ant-Man teaser, yeah, it works.  This is how you build hype in the Marvel Universe Marvel isn't the only studio that's been using the teaser teaser lately. There were two for both Terminator Genisys and Jurassic World, including one each without any actual footage. Teaser teasers have been effective for big films like these — they get movies' names out there, and they get people talking about them, even when there's next to nothing in the teaser to discuss. It's marketing genius, but it's also such a strange experience for fans: the trailer is cut, ready, and sitting around on a server somewhere waiting for the publish button to be pressed, but it's being held until a more auspicious moment comes up. For Marvel, that's often right in the middle of its own TV shows. Ant-Man's teaser will first air during the series premiere of Agent Carter on Tuesday at 8PM ET on ABC. You can expect a lot more teasers, trailers, teaser trailers, and teaser teasers as we enter superhero madness, which is scheduled to last for the next five years.

Those are the broad strokes of Google's planned wireless service in the US, according to a report from Android Police based on a leaked app. It's not possible to be certain that the leak originated from Google itself, however its level of detail and the way it meshes with earlier reports about Google's plans would suggest there's something to it. The app in question is called Tycho, and it contains all the usual settings and options you might expect from a carrier app. You can pay bills, check your data usage, adjust plan details, and so on. But you can also activate your service with Google, request a new number, or switch numbers directly from within the app as well. This is also the spot where you'll be able to pause or suspend your wireless data service or even close your account entirely. So, in quite literal terms, wireless service turned into an app. Well, more than one app, actually, since there's also reference to a separate Project Fi app. Project Fi appears to be the codename for Google's wireless service, which this leaks suggests will offer free calls and texts within the United States while charging for data on a per-gigabyte basis. T-Mobile and Sprint, the two carriers that were reported as Google's partners that would provide cellular connectivity, also make appearances in the leaked app. Verizon and AT&T are notable for their absence. Another interesting aspect of this leak is that it suggests Google will offer data-only options for at least some devices on a given plan. That could work out nicely if you don't care to make phone calls with your 4G tablet. A month ago, Google's Sundar Pichai confirmed the rumors that the Mountain View company was planning a wireless service of its own, though he added an important caveat: ""we don't intend to be a carrier at scale."" As the chief in charge of Google's mobile products, Pichai is one of the key decision makers who'll shape the way the company's wireless service works, and his focus is on creating a seamless wireless service that exploits Wi-Fi as much as cellular networks. That's where Google can potentially disrupt the status quo, even if it doesn't have immediate plans to go to a large-scale deployment. In any case, Google I/O this summer looks like the time when Pichai and company will have more to disclose.

Augmenting our audio-visual experiences with odor isn't a new idea — theaters experimented with the concept several times between 1906 - 1960. Perhaps most famous of these pilots is Smell-O-Vision, which was used (without much success) in three theaters for the movie Scent of Mystery in 1960. Later, scratch and sniff was invented as a far cheaper way to generate scents. Only one film-maker truly embraced the technology, but in recent years advertisers have been using it to promote their wares. The deluxe edition of Katy Perry's Teenage Dream smelled like cotton candy, and games like Fifa 2001 and Gran Turismo 2 simulated the smell of turf and burning rubber, respectively, with a simple scratch. Apart from these experiments, there aren't many examples of odor successfully taking hold in either entertainment or advertising. Why will this new invention be any different? The smelling screen is a regular television with four fans mounted along its edges that pump odors in the right direction. It generates scent from hydrogel ""aroma chips,"" which are heated to produce vapor. Using the fans at varying rates, the system can purportedly give the illusion that a scent is coming from a certain place on the screen. It's this directional accuracy that sets the smelling screen apart from systems in the past. The researchers have only been able to generate one odor at any given time so far, but hope to develop cartridges with multiple scents that can be swapped out for different movies and programs.  The team faces a huge challenge to get their system into homes — persuading manufacturers to incorporate fans, heating pumps, and odor cartridge slots into their televisions is a big task. But just as scratch and sniff transformed from a cinematic experience into an advertising gimmick, the smelling screen may find a home in marketing. In a paper presenting the research, inventor Haruka Matsukura points out that bakeries, popcorn stands, and other food retailers already utilize scent to attract customers. Matsukura's displays, if proved to be reliable, could represent a powerful new tool for advertisers, who have been looking into similar tech for some time.

The court today rejected a patent application from Novartis, the world's second-largest drug manufacturer, for the  breakthrough leukemia drug Glivec. It ruled that Novartis' new drug represents only a ""minor tweak to an existing drug"" whose patent has expired, echoing critics' complaints that the manufacturer was attempting to exploit a loophole to squeeze more money out of the medicine. The practice of making minor changes to drugs to extend their patents — known in the industry as ""evergreening"" — was effectively outlawed in 2005 by Indian lawmakers, and today's decision solidified that ruling. Glivec, the brand name for Imatinib, has been the subject of many court battles over the past six years. Its progress through the Indian court system has been seen as a test case for laws relating to patent expiry and generic drugs. In 2007, Novartis' attempt to challenge the legality of the Indian patent system was squashed by a High Court in what was seen as a victory for the generic drugs industry as a whole. India's legal system is especially relevant to the generic trade as some of the industry's largest manufacturers are located in the country.

The burgeoning field of quantum cryptography, first proposed in the 1970s, uses quantum physics in an effort to create a communications channel that can't be eavesdropped upon without the participants noticing (though some experts have argued that it still doesn't address major intrusion points).

In a filing last week Apple said it wanted Bromwich out, and accused him of having a personal bias against the company. Moreover, Apple had also tried to reverse the need for a monitor entirely, something Cote denied as part of her ruling today, Reuters reports. Still on the job The spat between the two began weeks ago. Bromwich fired first, saying the company had been wholly uncooperative, shutting him out from speaking with board members and executives as part of his job. Apple's lawyers then took Bromwich to task, saying he charged too much for his services, and overstepped his boundaries of viewing the deepest parts of its business. Bromwich's two-year post at Apple was just part of a set of penalties placed on the company following its loss in court last year.

The DC circuit court has ruled on Verizon v. FCC, a challenge to the net neutrality rules put in place in 2010, vacating the FCC's anti-discrimination and anti-blocking policies, though it preserved disclosure requirements that Verizon opposed — in other words, carriers can make some traffic run faster or block other services, but they have to tell subscribers. The problem isn't that the court opposed the FCC's goals, it's that unlike older telecommunications providers, ISPs aren't classified as ""common carriers"" that must pass information through their networks without preference. By enforcing net neutrality, the court found, the agency was imposing rules that didn't apply to carriers. It's an issue that net neutrality supporters have been worried about for years: ""The FCC — under the leadership of former Chairman Julius Genachowski — made a grave mistake when it failed to ground its Open Internet rules on solid legal footing,"" says Free Press president Craig Aaron. ""Internet users will pay dearly for the previous chairman's lack of political will."" ""We will consider all available options, including those for appeal."" Despite striking down parts of the rules, Judge David Tatel said that the FCC should have some authority to regulate service providers. The FCC justified its rules partly by saying that the Open Internet order promotes broadband development, an explicit agency goal. While opponents of net neutrality have said that there's little evidence these rules actually help, Tatel disagreed, saying that the idea was ""both rational and supported by substantial evidence."" Verizon also argued that Congress was responsible for passing regulations, but ""although regulation of broadband Internet providers certainly involves decisions of great 'economic and political significance' ... we have little reason given this history to think that Congress could not have delegated some of these decisions to the Commission."" Notably, Tatel also agreed that striking down net neutrality could have negative effects on consumers. ""The commission has adequately supported and explained its conclusion that absent rules such as those set forth in the Open Internet Order, broadband providers represent a threat to internet openness and could act in ways that would ultimately inhibit the speed and extent of future broadband deployment,"" he said, saying that broadband companies have ""powerful incentives"" to charge for prioritized access or to exclude services that competed with their own offerings. Without net neutrality, ""broadband providers represent a threat to internet openness."" Unfortunately for the commission, the particular rules it tried to make — anti-blocking and anti-discrimination measures — were expressly allowed only for common carriers. Despite the FCC's arguments, Tatel didn't think that the Open Internet rules were more permissive than common carrier standards, nor did he think that internet service providers could be counted as something besides carriers, an argument that could have opened the door to more regulations. FCC chair Tom Wheeler said that the agency would continue the fight, though it's not clear exactly how. ""I am committed to maintaining our networks as engines for economic growth, test beds for innovative services and products, and channels for all forms of speech protected by the First Amendment. We will consider all available options, including those for appeal, to ensure that these networks on which the Internet depends continue to provide a free and open platform for innovation and expression, and operate in the interest of all Americans."" Update: Verizon has responded to the decision, saying that the FCC could no longer ""impose last century's common carriage requirements on the internet"" and insisting that service will only get better. One thing is for sure: today's decision will not change consumers' ability to access and use the internet as they do now. The court's decision will allow more room for innovation, and consumers will have more choices to determine for themselves how they access and experience the internet. Verizon has been and remains committed to the open internet that provides consumers with competitive choices and unblocked access to lawful websites and content when, where, and how they want.

As Le Monde reports, the nationwide demonstrations were organized by five major taxi unions, which are protesting the ""unfair competition"" that Uber and other chauffeur services pose. Kat Borlongan, co-founder of consulting firm Five by Five, was traveling from the Charles de Gaulle airport Monday morning when her Uber car was attacked by protesters. The assailants threw rocks and paint at their van, before smashing a passenger window and slashing one of its tires. Uber confirmed the attack in a statement, and an eyewitness corroborated Borlongan's account to The Verge.   Attackers tried to get in the car but our brave @uber driver maneuvered us to safety, changed the tire on the freeway and got us home.  Renaud Visage, photographer and CTO of Eventbrite, was traveling in the car with Borlongan, and corroborated her reports in a phone interview. Visage says taxis blockaded one of the main highways from the airport, forcing cars to file through a single lane. When their van passed through the checkpoint, ""three or four"" men on each side started throwing rocks and paint at them, shattering the back window and leaving the passengers with cuts on their hands. At a second blockade, an assailant slashed the back tire, forcing them to pull off the road a few minutes later.  Protesters descended upon an Uber van outside Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris, amid widespread demonstrations against smartphone-based cab services. (Renaud Visage) ""They also tried to open the doors, but fortunately our driver had locked them,"" says Visage, who was returning to Paris from a trip to the Philippines. All told, it took them about two hours to reach their destination, leaving Visage in a state of ""emotional trauma."" Visage says their van didn't have any Uber signage or logos, though the protesters clearly identified it as a chauffeur service, and were attacking vehicles from other independent operators, as well. He says law enforcement was on hand, though no one intervened to stop the violence. ""The police were there, but they were just watching."" ""The police were there, but they were just watching,"" he says. ""They were not actively doing anything."" As many as 5,000 taxi drivers are striking today across several French cities, in protest of new regulations that allow Uber and other smartphone-based cab services to operate in the country. A decree issued in December allowed independent operators to offer their services in France, as long as they wait for at least 15 minutes before picking up a passenger. The provision was intended to appease taxi unions, who describe Uber and similar services as ""multinationals,"" but they're now calling for tighter restrictions, including a minimum 30-minute delay. Uber and other cab-hailing services have faced resistance from taxi groups in the US, as well, forcing regulators to carve out new rules for their use. Uber, meanwhile, has responded rapidly to today's events.

(David Prasad / Flickr) You arrive at the airport and the security line is huge. You're nervously glancing at your watch and the snake of people in front of you, when an employee from the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) suddenly pulls you aside. You've been selected for the PreCheck line, which means you won't have to take off your shoes, remove your computer, or sweat through the tedium that normal security lines entail. You waltz past the checkpoint and arrive at your gate with time to spare, and everything seems great — except for the fact that you've just breezed through a security procedure typically reserved for thoroughly vetted passengers. You never applied for the PreCheck program, never submitted fingerprints or filed paperwork, but for some reason you've been deemed ""safe"" enough for the express lane. It's a scenario that many passengers have experienced in recent months, and one that has raised concerns over how the TSA is rolling out PreCheck — an expedited security program that launched more than two years ago and has since expanded to more than 100 US airports with nine partner airlines. Subscribers who submit to a background check, provide fingerprints, undergo an interview, and pay an $85 fee can pass through security with minimal safety checks. They're also allowed to pass through standard metal detectors, rather than the full-body scanners that have drawn so much controversy in recent years. ""This is TSA's biggest secret of all, and it should be."" The idea is to speed up the screening process by moving away from a ""one size fits all"" approach to airport security, though the program has since expanded to include passengers who haven't been pre-vetted. Last year, the agency began incorporating non-enrolled travelers into PreCheck lines as part of a policy known as ""managed inclusion."" Under the program, behavior-detection officers — some accompanied by bomb-sniffing dogs — analyze passengers' behavior as they wait in security. If they display no anxiety or other high-risk behaviors, they may be invited to go through the PreCheck line. TSA administrator John Pistole has defended the program before Congress, arguing that the methods deployed are ""scientifically validated,"" though the agency has revealed few details on the criteria it uses to select passengers — whether from the security line, or during the application process. ""This is TSA's biggest secret of all, and it should be,"" says Jeff Price, an aviation security expert and professor at the Metropolitan State University of Denver. ""Part of the success of the program is to not let people know how they are selected or the criteria.""  The TSA says it selects some passengers for PreCheck in order to speed up security lines. (Wayan Vota / Flickr) Doing so, some say, would make it easier for criminals to slip through PreCheck, though privacy groups argue that the TSA should be more transparent about its standards. The PreCheck application program is exempt from some provisions of the federal Privacy Act, in order to protect information that could compromise criminal investigations, but privacy advocates say there should be greater oversight. ""That's a problem because it can be quite subjective,"" says Khaliah Barnes, administrative law counsel at the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC). ""It's not exactly clear how the TSA is leveraging all the information that is amassed to make determinations about individuals."" EPIC has urged Congress to implement stronger oversight and privacy protection over the PreCheck database, pointing to factual inaccuracies and the sensitive information that the database contains — information like fingerprints, social security numbers, and birth certificates. The TSA has dismissed allegations that PreCheck invades passenger privacy, noting that the program remains voluntary, and has said that it does not tolerate ethnic or racial profiling. Yet EPIC fears that citizens won't have legal recourse to challenge the TSA's decisions if the agency's database remains sealed, and lawmakers have so far been reluctant to take action. ""The underlying premise of PreCheck, I think, is wrong."" There are also doubts over whether the TSA's behavior-detection methods are even effective at identifying potential threats. A November report from the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that behavior-detection techniques work only ""slightly better than chance"", and that they may be applied on inconsistent or subjective bases. The report was especially discouraging considering that the TSA has spent an estimated $1 billion on implementing behavior-detection protocols since launching the program in 2007. The TSA later contested the report's findings, saying they were based on a survey of academic studies focused on identifying liars, rather than the suspicious behaviors that its agents are looking for. Jim Harper, director of information policy studies at the Cato Institute, says it's equally futile to sift through mountains of personal information in the hopes of uncovering potential terrorists. Recent attacks, he notes, have been executed or attempted by ""lone wolves,"" such as the suspected Boston Marathon bombers and Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, who tried to smuggle a bomb onto a plane in 2009. ""The underlying premise of PreCheck, I think, is wrong,"" Harper says. ""That is the idea that you can go looking through a person's biography and figure out whether they're a threat or not."" ""I don't think the government should be in a position of segregating society."" Yet Harper and security experts see value in PreCheck's unpredictability. TSA agents select passengers to pass through PreCheck at irregular times and locations, usually depending on queue length, and some eligible travelers are randomly selected prior to going through security. That makes it harder for would-be terrorists to exploit the system, but Harper still has reservations about a two-tiered approach to airport security. As the program expands, he argues, it's not hard to imagine a situation where affluent passengers whisk through PreCheck, while poorer or less experienced travelers remain trapped in longer lines. ""To some degree, that's a simple product of economic inequality,"" Harper says. ""But when it's the government standing there, enforcing a system predicated upon economic inequality, that's not cool... I don't think the government should be in a position of segregating society that way."" For the moment, however, the TSA has shown no signs of scaling back or reforming the PreCheck program. Since its launch in October, 2011, more than 30 million people have used the expedited service, and the agency plans to expand it to more airports over the coming year. The response from randomly selected travelers has been largely positive, as well, though there have been some growing pains. ""The problem now is that some frequent flyers are selecting the normal line because the PreChecks line are backed up with people who don't understand the process,"" says Price. ""I think this is going to hurt the program in terms of enrollment, but we'll see what happens in the long-term.""",0.4955249798199368,0.5044750201800632,0.6642940361601563,1153,5.3772766695576752,597,6.5527638190954773,0,0,"Policy & Law, US & World, National Security, Report",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

Apocalypse pop is a subgenre of radio dance pop that I made up, whose lyrics and musicality invoke the end of the world, usually to rationalize dancing for a very long time or engaging in sexual activity with someone you might otherwise not. For reference, the holy trinity of apocalypse pop is ""Give Me Everything"" (Pitbull feat. Ne-Yo, Afrojack, and Nayer), ""Till The World Ends"" (Britney Spears), and ""We Found Love"" (Rihanna feat. Calvin Harris). All three of those songs were released in 2011 — the brief reign of apocalypse pop coincided with the rise of the EDM-crossover pop hit, back when EDM could still be said to cross over into the mainstream, rather than take up indefinite residence there. Apocalypse pop was predated by the rise of Ke$ha and LMFAO, silly party tracks that were about having a good time at the expense of health and good taste. These songs, perhaps most literally exemplified by Katy Perry's ""Last Friday Nite (T.G.I.F.),"" were obviously nihilistic in their own way, but were delivered with a metal-mouthed grin. It did not take very long for the party to get weird. A minor key started creeping into the mix, with Far East Movement's ""Like a G6"" and its champagne-bucket-cold synth line and endless, mindless repetition of its titular lyric. ""Like a G6"" sounds like walking for hours through a maze of subterranean passageways in Forever 21 stiletto heels, looking for the party and never quite finding it, which is to say it sounds amazing.  Both this period and the apocalypse pop period were criticized for a perceived lack of substance, the full musical expression of a generation of apathetic libertines. But more accurately, it was the sound of pop artists and producers figuring out how to fully integrate the sound of ""the clurb"" into their hits, and the first instinct was to use those inhuman, too-big-to-be-real electronic melodies to channel their basest poetic feelings. Something about the dominant big-room EDM sound — 130 bpm, minor key, syncopated — suggested a kind of careening instability that obviously found some kind of resonance in the post-recession mainstream. At the core of these songs was something earnest and vital — and yes, totally nihilistic But more importantly, once you got past the winking and smirking of Ke$ha and Katy, at the core of these songs was something earnest and vital — and yes, totally nihilistic. When Ne-Yo wails ""give me everything,"" it's ostensibly about sex, but it's also a call to action: dispense with all pretense and commit yourself fully to this sick beat / your marathon training / your career aspirations — not necessarily for the betterment of yourself, but because you've realized you're nothing but a bag of meat and bones that could be wiped out at any moment by some whim of the universe.  At a not-at-all raging New Year's house party in 2011, I remember somewhat obnoxiously taking over the stereo and plugging in my phone so we could listen to ""Till The World Ends"" when the clock struck midnight. People got up and danced, hesitantly at first, because you kind of have to dance to ""Till The World Ends."" Eventually we were all bouncing around the living room, counting down the seconds to 2012. There is something deeply primal about jumping up and down to a silly dance song as a new year begins, repeatedly, rhythmically utilizing our planet's gravity to reassure ourselves of its stability as we make another rotation around the Sun. It's a cliché, but like anything that invokes death, apocalypse pop necessarily invokes life as well.  After the world had collectively OD'd on endtimes (in pop at least — the apocalypse lives on in blockbuster filmmaking), the next wave of mainstream EDM hits started with Avicii's ""Levels,"" or, more likely, Flo Rida's hijacking of ""Levels"" for ""Good Feeling."" That song's refrain, from Etta James' ""Something's Got a Hold On Me,"" was a far cry from the ""let's ruin our lives at the club tonight"" vibe of 2011. Even if Avicii was using James' words as a roundabout reference to the effects of MDMA, the song was purely focused on the positive effects of that good feeling, not the perhaps less-good circumstances that may have led to the seeking out of that good feeling in the first place. Pop artists and producers soon realized they could find more universal appeal — and thus more licensing opportunities — if they accentuated the positive. Thus by 2013, we got Swedish House Mafia's ""Don't You Worry Child"" as well as Avicii and Aloe Blacc's ""Wake Me Up,"" songs with a redemptive bent, built around a soulful male vocal. The apocalypse got handed back to pop-rock, in songs like Imagine Dragons' world-endingly successful ""Radioactive"" (87 weeks on the Hot 100, a record it still holds) and Bastille's ""Pompeii."" When ""Wake Me Up"" first came out, I thought Avicii's EDM-folk hybrid was just about the worst collection of sounds I'd ever heard; rave-lite music for the Hollister set. But without it we wouldn't have the now-ubiquitous DJ Mike D remix of Hozier's ""Take Me To Church,"" a song I just realized is the most viable inheritor of the apocalypse pop banner we had this year.  The last time I heard it involuntarily was last night at a nearly-empty vegetarian café near Columbus Circle. When it came on, blasting fuzzily from the boom box in the corner, the one other diner in the establishment looked up at the girl behind the counter, smiled, and said ""I love this song."" I've overheard versions of that exchange several times now with regard to this song, in line at the drug store or at Chop't, but this time it stuck with me. Here was this guy, eating his meatless dinner by himself on a cold winter night while reading his phone (same as me, to be honest), probably getting goosebumps when Andrew Hozier-Byrne yells ""Good god, let me give you my life!"" (Also same as me, to be even more honest.) I challenge and dare anyone to be cynical about that lyric. You can be sick of the song, but that moment is irony-free. It's a belated response to Ne-Yo's 2011 request, but Ne-Yo could not have predicted how serious we'd be three years later. Dance music has always had an evangelical undercurrent YouTube commenters seem to be less sold on the dance version (""This remix is an abomination. All of the original song's poignant emotion is lost in this remix."") but throwing that somewhat arbitrary dance beat over its towering melody is what makes it apocalypse pop, driving it eyes-closed toward an ever-more-imminent white light. Dance music has always had an evangelical undercurrent (guy behind a pulpit, hands up, ecstasy) and remixing ""Take Me To Church"" for the club seems only logical. Lyrically, the song, like most apocalypse pop, is about sex. But when Hozier talks about death it feels more like the big kind than the little kind. It certainly sounds like the end of the year, if not the world, but it would probably only work at tomorrow night's New Year's party if everyone actually got raptured at midnight.",0.557261615346683,0.44273838465331705,0.15646568626609222,1227,4.8141809290953548,648,6.0925925925925926,0,0,"Culture, Entertainment, Essay",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Earlier this month, my other bestest friend Chris Plante (I have a lot of bestest friends, I'm not picky) named ""Never Catch Me"" the best music video of the year. While I agree with them, mostly, I'd like to take a moment to appreciate the performances of 2014. It's one of my favorite parts of late night and award shows — a chance for the musician to show off with no second takes or (extensive) post-production. Consider this a small sampling of the year's best performances. If your favorite isn't on the list, then it's probably because we didn't see it — so let us know!  It's rare for Daft Punk to perform these days, but when they do, it's an all-out spectacle (cf. pyramids). For this year's Grammy Awards, Daft Punk waits a full two minutes into ""Get Lucky"" before revealing themselves, opting instead to dance in a dark mocked-up recording room while Pharrell, Nile Rodgers, and Stevie Wonder play, crescendoing into a blend of electronic and '70s funk. Admittedly, I still find this song catchy.  Note: Looks like NBC has nixed the breakout clip, so just skip ahead to the 26-minute mark and enjoy Prince is another musical recluse, but this year he released two albums and celebrated the 30th anniversary of Purple Rain. So he gets eight minutes on Saturday Night Live to play a medley of whatever he wants, because he's Prince. It was one of the best SNL musical spots this year.  ... but while Prince was pretty much guaranteed to rock the house, Kendrick Lamar was surprising in how dramatic and powerful his two performances of the night were. Honorable mention goes to his untitled song debut during The Colbert Report's last week, but performance-wise, his showmanship (and contact lenses) on ""i"" was the best.  Beyoncé wasn't eligible for the 2014 Grammy Awards since she literally surprised the world with her self-titled album not one month prior. Still, it was all anyone could talk about, so she basically had to start the show with ""Drunk in Love,"" featuring her husband Jay Z.  Does a hologram count as a live performance? The musicians around her were actually playing, so we're including it here. Hatsune Miku's US television debut is a landmark moment for the Japanese superstar. Sure, she's 100 percent artificial, but you could also say she's completely honest and upfront about her artificiality. Besides, she could be the future of music.  With both Late Night and now The Tonight Show, Jimmy Fallon has always found ways to integrate music into the whole show. And while a number of Verge staffers recommended Lip Sync Battle, I'm going with Daniel Radcliffe's cover of Blackalicious's ""Alphabet Aerobics"" because he's actually performing and... you know... it's Harry Potter.  Stephen Colbert has big shoes to fill when he takes over for David Letterman as host of The Late Show next year — not just for the obvious reasons, but also because Letterman managed to book impressive musical talent. The Colbert Report seemed to ramp up its musical guests over the last several years. This Jon Batiste and Stay Human performance is one of the all-time best if for no other reason than because it breaks out of the studio and onto the streets. Honorable mention goes to Michael Fassbender wearing a giant cartoon head singing about love.  Multiple Verge staffers brought up this Future Island performance. I told Chris Plante I'd just quote him on this one: ""For me, it's the most important live performance on late night in a decade because it's the only time I've seen a.) a band actually perform like they do on stage b.) the lead singer dance like my father on Quaaludes and c.) make grumpy David Letterman care about anything beyond his paycheck.""    Look, this list was getting long and I really wanted to include Run the Jewels, but J. Cole's performance was so powerful that I had to include him. Sorry for the arbitrary cutoff, El-P and Killer Mike.  Vox Media has an official Taylor Swift chatroom to talk about all things Taylor, and unanimously they said her take on ""All Too Well"" at the Grammy Awards was best of the year. I really don't want to argue with them; it's a pretty popular chat room.  One more Jimmy Fallon moment for the list. Billy Joel and Jimmy Fallon use an iPad app to sing incredible harmonized doo-wop. Honorable mention, though it's more entertaining than musical, goes to the years-in-the-making Will Ferrell vs. Chad Smith drum-off.  The final Colbert Report music performance, starring Stephen himself and countless celebrity guests of variable / questionable musical talent. It was the perfect send-off to the character's nine-year run.  So far, this list has been centered around performances that debuted on TV, but have you heard T-Pain sing without autotune?

A newly leaked build (10056) has surfaced on the internet today, and it shows that Microsoft is improving the touch experience in Windows 10. When you enable tablet mode, any apps on the taskbar are removed, and you're thrown into a UI that only has access to the Start Screen, virtual desktops, and the Cortana digital assistant. It's a lot more similar to how Windows 8.1 does touch, but the Charms bar has still been replaced by the notification center with quick access to settings and notifications. You can swipe in from the left to access recent apps, and the Start Screen has a fullscreen view of Live Tiles and apps. There's also a new animation to bring up the Start Screen, and it simply glides into view over your desktop wallpaper. You can even launch desktop apps and they'll automatically expand fullscreen without cluttering the taskbar. If you switch off tablet mode, it reverts to the traditional desktop view with all your apps open and resized into windows.  I haven't been a fan of how much of the touch experience has been lost in Windows 10, so it's encouraging to see Microsoft bringing back the parts that make sense. It's clearly just an early look at some of the touch tweaks, and Microsoft is also introducing a new black theme throughout this Windows 10 build. The notification center is now black, and most of the UI elements are equally dark. There's even a new recycle bin icon that looks a little better than Microsoft's previous effort. You can also resize the Start Menu again, and switch transparency on or off. There's even an option to change the color for the UI across Windows 10 to match your background. Little else is changed, though, and it's likely that we'll see this or another similar build available for official testing in the coming weeks.

Garmin tried this with its last camera, the VIRB Elite, and now it's looking to do the same with two smaller cameras that promise to be much more capable: the VIRB X and the VIRB XE. The new cameras come in a much smaller form factor than the Elite, which was oblong in shape with a camera facing out from one end. The smaller and more rectangular X and XE, on the other hand, look more like ruggedized GoPros than anything. The two models are also tiered in their price and quality, much like how GoPro offers ""Black"" and ""Silver"" models. The X is the more basic model and will cost $299, while the XE — which has slightly better internals — will run $399.   Inside the XE, Garmin is offering the ability to shoot up to a resolution of 1440p at 30 frames per second, or 1080p at 60 frames per second. It also has a ""pro mode"" that lets users make common adjustments like white balance and exposure while also tweaking less common settings like sharpness control and ISO limit. The video capabilities of the X top out at 1080p at 30 frames per second, and both cameras can shoot 12MP still images. Both are also equipped with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, and Garmin says each camera should get about two hours of battery life. There's no crazy slow-motion shooting or 4K resolution available here, but that's a game Garmin would likely lose anyway; its competitors already do that really well. The VIRB XE tops out at 1440p  Garmin's game is to aim for the truly sports-minded user, something I found out when I tested the Elite against the other leading action cameras last fall. While its video quality didn't stack up against the others, it did offer some rather unique features. The Elite was ruggedized, it had really good battery life (most competitors have trouble eclipsing an hour; the Elite easily passed that), and it could keep track of data like GPS and heart rate. It also was able take that data and, along with other information like speed and acceleration, overlay it right on your video so your friends would know just how fast you were, say, biking down a trail.   The company promises even more with the new cameras, including measuring things like the G-loads you experience during things like skydiving and aerobatic maneuvers, or tracking the vertical feet covered while you're skiing down a mountain. The new shape should also allow you to mount it in more ways, and that's another improvement. Users of the Elite were limited by the oblong shape, which was a bit too unwieldy to strap to your head. For that to happen, however, Garmin will have to step up its accessories game. Companies like GoPro, Sony, and ION all do this extremely well, but the rest of the competition definitely doesn't. How this all comes together is yet to be seen; Garmin likely had to make some sacrifices in order to fit its internals into the much smaller package than it's used to designing for. But if the X and XE are any good, the company has a shot at cornering some of the market without taking a direct swing at GoPro.

It bounces off a tree trunk, smashes into a highway tunnel, or careens into the side of a building. It runs out of battery and falls into a body of water. Your four-figure investment is typically only as good as your ability to handle it once it's aloft — which is why I'm a bit anxious when I first take the controller for the Solo, which 3D Robotics is billing as the smartest drone ever. Competition for that title gets tougher all the time: just last week, DJI announced Phantom 3, the next version of its best-selling consumer drone, with improved cameras and the ability to live-stream video from the drone to YouTube. But Solo represents a step forward in a few big ways: onboard computers in the controller and the drone, allowing for enhanced controls; full access to GoPro camera controls in flight (a first); and software that allows novices to create intricate multistep shots using just a couple taps. Solo also offers a level of customer support previously unheard of in the industry. 3DR will give you a 30-day money-back guarantee if your drone bores you and free replacement if Solo breaks while in flight. The company is betting Solo will appeal to drone enthusiasts and novices alike — and that it can begin to chip away at the consumer drone market that the Phantom helped create. It is a critical time for 3DR, which has raised $85 million from investors.  “We are a player, but we are the underdog player,” says 3DR’s Colin Guinn. “How big of a defining moment is it? It is the moment. This is the introduction to the world of 3DR.” Guinn came to 3DR from DJI, where he was CEO of DJI's North American division. He helped lead design and marketing efforts for the Phantom, the Chinese company's hugely popular consumer model. Thanks in part to a series of popular YouTube videos where Guinn showed off the Phantom’s capabilities, he became well known to hobbyists. One drone blog continues to refer to him in headlines as ""The Guinnmeister."" But Guinn's relationship with DJI executives in China soured over business terms, lawsuits were filed, and last February he decamped with his team for 3DR. (Guinn declines to comment on the lawsuit, which was settled.) Now at 3DR, Guinn's official title is chief revenue officer. But his role at the company is much larger than the bean-counter title suggests: the new Solo drone is his baby, 3.3 pounds of precision-engineered flying plastic robot. And even all that  doesn't really get at the main thing about Colin Guinn, which is that he is obsessed with drones. Because he once ran an aerial photography company, shooting scenes for Hollywood films, Guinn has an all-encompassing knowledge about how to make movies in the sky. When he speaks, what comes across is this overwhelming sense that to own a drone is to have a superpower — and that if you could only master that power, you could bend the universe a little more exactly to your will. He mentions the history of comic book and fantasy characters who have the ability to see the world through the eyes of a bird. ""What is the difference between those powers and Solo, with a high-definition video feed coming from the GoPro?"" Guinn asks. ""We’re basically giving people a superhuman power for a thousand bucks."" It's time for me to try out my powers. On a blustery day in Berkeley, California, we take a pre-production Solo unit onto the roof of 3DR headquarters. Guinn pops the drone out of a separately sold backpack and spins on the rotors. He snaps in the battery and attaches a GoPro to the gimbal. The whole process takes about 60 seconds. I pick up the controller and press a button marked ""FLY."" The rotors spin up, and suddenly Solo is safely in the air, hovering 10 or so feet off the ground. Autopilot keeps it roughly in place while I think about what to do next. We decide to shoot a selfie, a pre-scripted shot you can find in the app that runs on your tablet. With a couple taps, Solo zooms off into the sky, then slowly flies back in, keeping me perfectly in frame. We watch it all unfold on Guinn's iPad Mini, which snaps onto the controller and accesses most of Solo's functions. When it's all done, we save the video to the iPad's camera roll. If I wanted, I could post it to Instagram while I'm still flying. Solo does more complicated shots, too. A ""cable cam"" lets you set up a virtual line in the sky and then have Solo traverse it automatically, as if suspended on a wire. We use it to create dramatic shots that rise up above the railroad tracks next to 3DR headquarters and smoothly pan to reveal the San Francisco Bay behind us. 3DR is already seeding Solo units with filmmakers; Guinn says director Michael Bay's review of Solo, having used it once, was: ""Fuuuuuck."" I just fly Solo using trial and error I'm no Michael Bay, though I'm pretty sure I could get the drone to explode if I could only figure out how to turn off the autopilot. Over a handful of 20-minute flights, I never even develop the muscle memory for what the control sticks do; I just fly Solo using trial and error. It's a luxury that most drones simply haven't afforded up until now; it helped me to relax and enjoy myself in a way I can't imagine being possible even a year ago. Toward the end of one flight, while trying to get a shot, I find myself walking backward while keeping my eyes focused on Solo overheard. THUNK. I trip over a small HVAC unit on 3DR's roof and fall flat on my ass. Various bits of plastic fly off the controller, and the battery comes loose, barely tethered to the unit. I'm dazed, my video team is laughing, and Guinn is asking if I'm alright. And Solo? It's still humming away up above me, perfectly content in the 20 mph winds, ready to do whatever I ask, with 70 percent of its battery remaining. We reassemble the controller and land it safely with two button taps. I crashed; the drone didn't. Score one for the robots. 3DR is unveiling Solo today at the National Association of Broadcasters Show in Las Vegas, and it will begin shipping in a few weeks. For a base price of $999, with an optional $399 gimbal for enhanced camera controls, Solo is the first drone to offer full control of a GoPro camera. (I asked GoPro what they liked so much about Solo, and they sent back a bone-dry statement that didn't really answer the question — I assume because they worried about offending their other partners.) But the integration turns out to be a big deal: with Solo you can start and stop recordings, or change the camera's frame rate or other settings while in flight. It's stuff filmmakers have been asking for forever. Most drones use a single computer, located in the flying unit, and broadcast signals to it using a controller. Solo, on the other hand, has 1 Ghz processors in both the controller and the quadcopter. The processor on the quadcopter is devoted entirely to autopilot functions necessary to keep it aloft. Meanwhile, the controller serves as Solo's ""frontal cortex,"" and operates higher-level functions — some of which will arrive through future software updates. (My favorite of these, which I used in a test unit, is a flight ""rewind"" feature — simply tap and hold the ""pause"" button, which normally functions as a kind of emergency brake, and Solo retraces its steps. It's expected to ship within 60 days from launch.) It's stuff filmmakers have been asking for forever The Solo app will warn you when your battery is running low, flying home automatically to ensure you make it on time. (You can override the feature, but the controller will start vibrating until you land safely.) 3DR is also rolling out the world's most expansive customer service program for drone owners, for a product where service has been downright medieval. (Drone drop into the ocean? Sorry about that! Feel free to buy another.) It's the first drone to offer a 30-day money-back guarantee if you aren't satisfied with your purchase; you'll just have to complete a five-question survey, providing data 3DR will use to improve future versions. Meanwhile, a team of nearly 100 in-house technicians will respond to calls for help, using the data that Solo continuously logs during flights. The Solo app detects crashes and will ask you if you want to submit a trouble ticket in the event something goes wrong. If it's your fault, 3DR will offer to sell you a refurbished unit at a lower cost. And if the flight logs show Solo was at fault, 3DR will replace your drone — along with your gimbal and GoPro, if they also perished — at no cost. Will all that be enough to make 3DR the biggest player in the game? We may soon find out. The company was founded in 2009 by Chris Anderson, the author and former editor of Wired, and engineer Jordi Muñoz. (Anderson had been inspired in part by a 2007 incident in which he crashed a camera-equipped, remote-control plane into a tree at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory.) The pair met on a web forum Anderson created, DIY Drones, whose community had developed powerful open-source software for controlling flying objects. Today the company has 300 employees, with offices in Berkeley, San Diego, Tijuana, and Austin, Texas. Last fall 3DR introduced a consumer drone named Iris+. But it has lagged in sales behind DJI and Parrot, according to estimates from Gartner Research. DJI sold an estimated $500 million in drones last year for professional and amateur use, focused on aerial photography and videography. (Last summer, its Phantom 2 Vision+ was The Verge's pick for best consumer drone.) The market for consumer drones is still well under $1 billion, according to Gartner. But an FAA ruling in February finally gave explicit permission to what had previously been a legal gray area. And the cost of consumer drones is coming down, albeit slowly. The big three manufacturers are betting that if drones become a bit easier to use and develop an expanded range of applications, the market will grow more quickly. ""You press the button and you get the shot."" ""As the product becomes more sophisticated, the users can become less sophisticated,"" Anderson says. ""In the same way the iPhone transformed the phone by turning it into a single button — all that complexity reduced to a single button — what Solo does is it takes all the complexity of flying and robots and data acquisition and turns it into what is effectively a single button. You press the button and you get the shot."" It's in that sense that 3DR sees the latest drones as the start of a new age in drones. ""The first era of our industry was getting robots to fly. It was super hard! But we got there,"" Anderson says. ""The next era was making them easier to fly. I think we all got there. The next era is not flying them at all — making it so that their intelligence can be so profound that you can almost not care about the vehicle itself."" For all the time I spend with Solo — I visited the team several times over the past six months, flying prototypes in Austin and Berkeley — I never see a true production model. Even days before Solo is set to premiere, the team is still refining the software and hardware. Guinn pays fanatical attention to the product, and he rattles off requests to the software team throughout my visits. (""He's killing me,"" one executive laments.) In my tests, Solo performs mostly as we would hope. But Guinn fixates on a small tremor in the gimbal that might make captured footage less than butter-smooth, and while it's quite windy for my last flight, I can't help but notice that Solo sometimes has trouble staying still. Instead, it floats around in a roughly 3-foot cube, and I wonder how that might affect the footage I shoot. Meanwhile, it's hard to see what I'm shooting, because the glare is so bad on the iPad Mini. (Not Solo's fault, of course, but it does affect the user experience.) Flying Solo is a blast Flying Solo is a blast, and yet I’m still not sure I see the regular use case for myself. Getting great shots requires travel, and bringing Solo with me on vacation will mean checking one more bag and lugging it around. There are only so many drone-shot selfies a person needs, no matter how fun they are to shoot. So while I’m convinced Solo will make it easier and more fun for novices to fly drones, I’m skeptical of how much it can broaden the market for drones beyond hobbyists and filmmakers. Whether or not there’s space for three players in the consumer drone market or not, 3DR isn’t content to remain in third place. The Guinnmeister may not want to talk about his days at DJI — about the fact that the Solo, had he stayed at the company, would have been the Phantom 3 that was announced last week — but there's no doubt that he wants to win. ""We’re an order of magnitude less well known than our bigger competitor,"" he says. ""But I think that’s all gonna change really soon."" He notes that Solo is launching in 10 countries and will be available at thousands of big-box retail locations, featured in giant kiosks with flight simulators. ""The world is about to know who 3DR is.""",0.6384058506362842,0.3615941493637158,0.8423510168213584,2351,4.6299447043811144,1050,6.1409523809523812,0,48,"Tech, Exclusive",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Tesla, which has as much to gain from improved battery technology as any company in the world, is desperately trying to figure out how to move the market forward, and now it sounds like Google is doing the same. A new report from The Wall Street Journal indicates that the secretive and experimental Google X lab is trying to develop new battery technology to power its expanding universe of hardware products and emerging technology. While better batteries could certainly make for a better Nexus phone, the report indicated that Google was likely to push this technology across a wide variety of the less established industries it works in, including its self-driving cars as well as more general healthcare, robotics, and communications groups. How much of a priority this is to Google remains to be seen, though — the WSJ says that only four people are currently part of this team, one of whom is former Apple employee and battery expert Dr. Ramesh Bhardwaj.

Their full findings appear today in the journal Science.    The device could tell cancerous cells to stop dividing The new device is called a ""transcriptor."" It's a microscopic piece of a DNA molecule inside a living cell that Stanford researchers genetically engineered to control the flow of another important molecule, RNA, as though it were an electrical current. RNA is responsible for translating DNA instructions in a cell's natural processes, so by controlling it, researchers can command an entire living cell. They could tell cancerous cells to stop dividing after they reach a certain number, or turn plant cells into sensors for monitoring the environment, as one scientist involved in the work told The Independent. The transcriptor can also be used to build more efficient types of circuits than are possible using all synthetic materials. The researchers  released some of their blueprints under a public domain license, which they hope will be used by other scientists to help speed up work on the overall goal of building a complete biocomputer. In February, a separate team at the University of Massachusetts published their own research on a similar, but slightly less complex genetic transistor.

The researchers programmed the robots to mimic some basic ant behaviors, such as to avoid obstacles and to follow light trails, which were used to represent pheromone trails that real ants leave for each other. They discovered that relying on just these simple behaviors, the robots were able to select the shortest path through a maze most of the time (over 70 percent of trials), approaching ant-like levels of success. The high level of performance of robots using only simple programs led the researchers to conclude that ants aren't using any ""complex cognitive process"" to pick their route, and instead rely mainly on a loose obstacle-avoidance system and directions laid out by peers that have already successfully navigated the maze.

Krebs on Security reports that hackers have stolen customer credit card data from the Dallas-based fashion chain Neiman Marcus. Krebs says his sources in the finance industry started to suspect a large retailer had been hacked after a December surge in fraudulent debit and credit card charges. The payments, Krebs says, were traced to cards that had been recently been used at Neiman Marcus' brick-and-mortar stores. Those suspicions were confirmed by Neiman Marcus spokesperson Ginger Reeder, who said that the chain was informed of ""potentially unauthorized payment card activity that occurred following customer purchases at Neiman Marcus Group stores"" by its credit card processor in mid-December. The company says it informed federal law enforcement agencies, in addition to ""a leading investigations, intelligence and risk management firm, and a leading forensics firm."" On January 1st, that forensics firm found evidence that the fashion chain was indeed ""the victim of a criminal cyber-security intrusion,"" and said that some customers' cards were ""possibly compromised"" as a result. The hack affects cards that were used in Neiman Marcus brick-and-mortar stores The scale and scope of the hack are yet to be revealed, but the amount of time the hackers had to access the data undetected may affect the number of customers affected. Target's hackers were reportedly able to obtain so much data — details for up to 40 million cards, and up to 70 million names, email addresses, and phone numbers — because the security hole stayed open from Thanksgiving until mid-December.

Dana McClintock from CBS corporate communications tweeted a statement, saying that ""we are pleased that our case will be heard and we look forward to having our day in court."" CBS: ""We are pleased that our case will be heard and we look forward to having our day in court."" Ever since it launched, Aereo has been the subject of a complex legal battle — networks have sued Aereo in many of the places it launched, and the company has counter-sued in some cases. The main complaint from the networks is that Aereo is violating copyright law be retransmitting signals without paying the same retransmission fees that cable and satellite providers pay. Aereo has tried to get around that by installing an antenna for every single customer it has, making the argument that it is essentially operating as an internet antenna for the content that is already free over the airwaves. The coming Supreme Court fight is actually something Aereo has been looking forward to. Last month, Aereo CEO Chet Kanojia said that ""we are unwavering in our belief that Aereo's technology falls squarely within the law."" Rather than deal with protracted legal battles in local areas across the country, it appears that Aereo would rather let the Supreme Court decide so it can continue its growth across the US unabated. ""We want this resolved on the merits rather than through a wasteful war of attrition,"" said Kanojia. ""This case is critically important not only to Aereo, but to the entire cloud computing and cloud storage industry. "" Aereo has responded with a lengthy statement of its own that backs up Kanojia's earlier remarks. ""We look forward to presenting our case to the Supreme Court and we have every confidence that the Court will validate and preserve a consumer's right to access local over-the-air television with an individual antenna, make a personal recording with a DVR, and watch that recording on a device of their choice,"" it reads. There's no word yet on when the broadcaster complaints will be formally presented to and ruled on by the Supreme Court, but there's now a chance that Aereo might be able to quell its legal worries on a larger scale — or that the service might have to revamp significantly or shut down entirely. However, past decisions may give Aereo a reason to be optimistic — last year, the United States Second Circuit Court of Appeals rejected an appeal from TV networks, concluding that Aereo's system does not infringe the broadcaster's copyrights. The full Aereo statement is below: ""We said from the beginning that it was our hope that this case would be decided on the merits and not through a wasteful war of attrition. We look forward to presenting our case to the Supreme Court and we have every confidence that the Court will validate and preserve a consumer's right to access local over-the-air television with an individual antenna, make a personal recording with a DVR, and watch that recording on a device of their choice. ""This case is critically important not only to Aereo, but to the entire cloud computing and cloud storage industry.  The landmark Second Circuit decision in Cablevision provided much needed clarity for the cloud industry and as a result, helped foster massive investment, growth and innovation in the sector.  The challenges outlined in the broadcasters’ filing make clear that they are using Aereo as a proxy to attack Cablevision itself and thus, undermine a critical foundation of the cloud computing and storage industry. ""We believe that consumers have a right to use an antenna to access over-the-air television and to make personal recordings of those broadcasts.  The broadcasters are asking the Court to deny consumers the ability to use the cloud to access a more modern-day television antenna and DVR.  If the broadcasters succeed, the consequences to consumers and the cloud industry are chilling.

In this instance, emails from the Yahoo Mail account of Bridget Anne Kelly — Christie's former deputy chief of staff who was fired by the governor last week — indicate a correspondence related to the controversial closure of lanes on the George Washington Bridge that connects Manhattan to Fort Lee, New Jersey. The circumstances surrounding those closures have since erupted into a controversy, dubbed ""Bridgegate,"" with Christie denying that he was involved in any ploy devised by his staff to close the lanes as part of a political vendetta. Using her Yahoo account rather than her professional one When a local newspaper filed a request for emails related to the issue, Christie's office replied with a statement that no such emails existed in its records. But as the Associated Press reports, a subpoena now reveals that Kelly had been using her Yahoo account rather than her professional one to orchestrate the lane closures.

The cellphone is by far the cheapest option at $5.21 per hour, with GPS clocking in at $10 an hour and an old-fashioned tail costing the authorities a whopping $275 per hour.

This marks the first time in history that the majority of the United States' lawmakers have fortunes totaling more than $1 million. The data, filed in May last year for the 530 members of Congress at the time, put their median net worth at $1,008,767, an increase on the previous year's figure of $966,000.

Last year's wealthiest member, Texas Republican Michael McCaul, had his own personal fortune fall from just over $500 million to $143.1 million - but as OpenSecrets points out, the shift isn't the result of a financial catastrophe, but instead indicative of new reporting rules that mean members of Congress can call assets and incomes belonging to their spouses as an ""asset over $1 million."" Only 8% of Americans think Congress is doing a good job McCaul's slide in reported fortune means of the five wealthiest members of Congress, four are Democrats. The party also comes out slightly ahead of their Republican counterparts when comparing Congressional members' net median income: the former are valued at a median of $1.04 million, while the latter reported median personal wealth of almost exactly $1 million. But the Democratic party also contained the only group to note a drop in wealth: the median net worth of party members in the Senate dipped, likely due to John Kerry's new position as Secretary of State, and the death of Senator Frank Lautenberg - worth a reported $87.5 million. As their personal fortunes rise, Congressional members are beginning to invest again. Real estate remains the most popular market, with the combined investment between $442.2 million and $1.4 billion. General Electric is the most popular company for Congressional investment, with 74 members pumping cash into the massive corporation.

The site monitors data available on large public trackers like The Pirate Bay, as well as additional info, to estimate how many times a particular file has been downloaded. The analysis is far from a precise science, but the site has concluded that Game of Thrones episodes were downloaded 8.1 million times from peer-to-peer file sharing sites. That far surpasses the other shows in the top five, The Walking Dead, Big Bang Theory, How I Met Your Mother, and Gotham, all of which have fewer than 5 million downloads each. The people who like Game of Thrones also like to torrent It will be interesting to see what happens to these numbers come next year. HBO's highly anticipated over-the-top streaming service is expected to launch day-and-date with the Game of Thrones season five premiere in April.

Leading up to its premiere this past Friday, HBO has kept its HD remasters of The Wire entirely under wraps — but now we can see just what the show looks like in HD. And, frankly, the results are quite good. Unlike The Simpsons, this is no half-assed scan-and-pan job that merely stretches or crops the original 4:3 frame to fill your widescreen TV. Since the show was originally shot on 35mm film, the editors had extra footage to work with to bring the remastered version to life. That means we now have a ""true"" widescreen version of The Wire to enjoy. However, it's important to note that this is absolutely not the definitive version — merely an alternative. As showrunner David Simon describes it, ""while this new version of The Wire is not, in some specific ways, the film we first made, it has sufficient merit to exist as an alternate version."" HD transfer is the result of painstaking effort Simon explains on his blog that HBO worked extensively on its own to complete the necessary work for the HD transfer. Its work included painting out crew and gear, as well as performing additional CGI to mask ""mistakes"" that are only visible at higher resolutions, and the company planned to release the new version this fall with essentially no input from Simon or the show's other creators. After he and others behind the show expressed their desire to be involved, however, HBO halted its planned fall release and ""allowed us to engage in detail,"" writes Simon. They quickly found that the additional space afforded by the ""new"" footage obtained from the HD transfers simply didn't work for every scene. Shots that had been meticulously composed for the traditional 4:3 frame needed some adjustments to be workable in 16:9. So, in some shots, the team decided to crop the footage in, losing some space above and below the frame to ensure that distracting details on the edges of the frame weren't seen. This is precisely the case with the clips below from the pilot, where the filmmakers placed D'Angelo and Wee Bey under the ""Chicken"" and ""Burger"" signs, respectively, with purpose. The shot in question occurs at the one-minute mark; the first clip is the original, and the third clip is the final approved version for the HD version. The second clip is the HD version HBO made before David Simon's input.    Despite the careful attention to detail, there's no denying that the new version fundamentally changes the feeling of the show. The widescreen aspect ratio is decidedly more cinematic, taking away from the harsh, almost journalistic feel of the original. And, unavoidably, certain shots suffer from the looser framing. The precision of the original framing and the focus afforded by it is certainly lost in some shots. (It's worth noting that some others do benefit from the wider presentation, as in the final shot from this SD and HD comparison clip.) ""Film is artifice."" Unfortunately, HBO currently has no public plans to release another version in HD that retains the original's 4:3 aspect ratio. (The upcoming Blu-ray set will only include the widescreen versions that are currently being broadcast on TV.) David Simon does say that ""I have made my suggestions and my inquiries"" regarding another version, but, nevertheless he is adamant that a 4:3 HD transfer would not be an improvement over the standard definition originals. In a lengthy (and highly informative) conversation with a commenter on his blog, he explains that the added resolution of HD brings clarity to objects in the frame that the filmmakers never intended to be seen. ""Film is artifice. We are lying at every fucking moment, trying to conjure fictional imagery and suspend disbelief, and we are doing so with finite time and resources,"" writes Simon. Since The Wire was created for standard definition, the show was made with its limitations in mind. According to Simon, The Wire in HD is no more authentic than The Wire in 16:9. One adds extra imagery to the left and right of the frame, while another adds depth to the image that wasn't there in the original. Some may prefer the new version — and he's glad for it — but his masterpiece has only a singular definitive version. And that's the original. See below for a series of screenshot comparisons collected by Redditors. Pay close attention to the edges of the frame.

You wear it. It has to look good on you. You probably won’t want to buy one without seeing it in person. And it might not take off at all if people don’t think it’s cool. So, Apple’s retail strategy for the Watch is a little different to other products. You can check it out in Apple’s own stores, of course, but the company is experimenting with other partners as well — places that never would have sold Apple products before. And the first phase of this occurred today, with pop-up Watch shops opening in major department stores in three fashion-forward cities: Tokyo, Paris, and London. We were at all three. Here’s what we saw. by Sam Byford As I approached Isetan, a huge department store in the bustling business district of Shinjuku, I thought I saw a big line of people. When I got there, I found out that at least half of them were reporters and photographers, so I ended up in line behind only about 15 actual customers. That line quickly grew, though, and at 10:30AM we were shuffled inside and guided to a dark stairwell. There, two lines formed: one for those who wanted to make an appointment to try the Watch on, and one for those who just wanted to see it in the store. This confused exactly everyone. When it became apparent that all the appointments had already been filled up until late afternoon, and soon not even then, several frustrated customers moved to the other line just so they could get a glimpse of the Watch within the hour. The Watch shop itself is a black void amid an otherwise well-lit department store. The neighboring, modestly shiny Cartier storefront looks like the glitziest place in the world by comparison. Glowing profile photos of the Watch adorn the walls, and the only other falls on the windowed table set up with examples of each model and band. The shop is nothing if not imposing. I've never ordered a $17,000 watch before, but I don't think this is a typical setting in which to do so. The crowd was, as you’d expect, a little different to Isetan’s usual demographic. There were a lot of curious Apple fans, of course, and attendance was mostly male. But as I was ushered into the shop to see the Watch myself for the first time, I wound up next to a bubbly Japanese woman in expensive-looking clothes peering at the rose gold Edition and telling staff that she’d buy one when she could. If Apple can bring a few more people like that into these stores, the experiment will have been more than worthwhile.   by Amar Toor I didn't really know what to expect this morning when I biked over to Galeries Lafayette, an upscale, tourist-drenched department store in central Paris. I figured the scene wouldn't be quite as frenzied as one of Apple's first-day-of-iPhone-sales extravaganzas, since there wouldn't be a footrace to actually buy anything, but I woke up early just to be safe. As it turns out, I didn't really need to. I arrived at the store around 8:15 AM, 45 minutes before the doors were to open. Red velvet ropes and metal barriers had been placed in front of one of the entrances, around which a group of employees were hanging out, dressed in all-black and staring at handheld devices. There were two people standing in line, both of them 20-something males. The first was a Chinese engineering student who lives in Germany, the second a tall, lanky Belgian software developer named Gaïtano. Both spent Thursday night in front of the building. ""I had like, half-an-hour sleep, in this chair,"" said Gaïtano, 23, pointing to a folding chair leaned against the wall. ""And he spent the night in a sleeping bag."" Like others I spoke with, the two men had already decided that they were going to purchase an Apple Watch, but Gaïtano hadn't decided on a model. Apart from them and the Apple employees who had flown in for the event, most appeared to be locals or vacationers who were there to try out the device for themselves. An older German man I later spoke with said he purchased one for his 14-year-old son as soon as preorders opened this morning; a young Chinese couple behind me in line had already decided on buying the Sport, Apple's cheapest model.   The entire area was patrolled by security guards in bright orange vests, though they didn't have much of a crowd to deal with. Perhaps 40 people had amassed outside by the time the doors opened, at which point the Apple employees ushered us inside and up an escalator to the second level. There, we were greeted with pep rally cheers and high-fives from a slew of employees, who were lined up in front of Apple's slice of the store. The welcome seemed a bit disproportionate, but I obliged with a high five or three. Galeries Lafayette is enormous, and it's very expensive. The central part of the store is a series of circular floors that look down on an open space full of luxury bags and perfumes. Hovering above it all is an ornate stained glass dome. It's the kind of place that attracts the rich and the haut couture fashionable, which is the demographic Apple seems to be targeting. But much like its September preview event at the store Colette, a mecca of all things hipster-chic, the people who gathered this morning weren't exactly fashionistas. The clientele was predominantly male, and it was at times difficult to differentiate journalists from customers. Apple's slice of real estate was comparatively small, with four sections of long wooden tables — much like what you'd find in any typical Apple Store, save for the Chanel and Dior stands that bordered it. The watches were displayed under glass along the wooden tables, with some working models available for people to try out. Each section was organized by watch model and divided by tall, Apple Watch-branded barriers. (The final section was devoted to iPhones.) Other watches are stored in the tables' RFID-controlled drawers, but the high-end Edition models were kept in an undisclosed location elsewhere in the store. An Apple employee who helped me try one on cited security reasons for the separation. Once the initial wave of excitement subsided, things settled into a more normal retail experience. If it weren't for the luxury goods and art deco architecture surrounding it, the carpeted space could've easily been part of any other Apple Store — full of clean edges and white paint. It's hard to say whether the Paris event was a ""success."" It certainly wasn't as chaotic as I expected, and no one I spoke with said the preview had convinced them to buy a smartwatch. Instead, it seems like Apple just reaffirmed decisions that its most loyal customers had already made. As I was leaving, I saw Gaïtano trying on an Edition. He looked at me and flashed a wide smile.     by Tom Warren A passer-by looks at an Apple Watch on display in an Isetan window. ""Coming soon."" The watches may have been under glass, but that didn't stop people trying to touch them. Asia is an important market for the 18-karat gold Apple Watch Edition. Just as many people were interested in the aluminum Apple Watch Sport, which starts at a more affordable $349. Apple's Isetan shop is like the evil twin of the company's regular stores. The entrance to Isetan. The Watch shop is immediately on your left as you enter. Right next to Apple is Cartier. These assistants seemed somehow less busy than their neighbors. Isetan. This was the scene outside Galeries Lafayette about 45 minutes before it opened. Two people were in line.  Apple's slice of Galeries Lafayette looks over a metropolis of luxury stands. The art-deco building feels like an old opera house. Apple's section is on the second level, near stands for Chanel, Dior, and upscale macaroons. The Apple Watch Edition is a strictly hands-off, appointment-only affair. Apple Watch Sport bands were displayed on one of the barriers separating each section.  The crowd today was sizable, but not exactly swarming. The last display section is devoted to iPhones. Customers are fitted for the Apple Watch Edition at a separate table, with brown leather mats. Displays allow customers to play around with Apple Watch apps on a larger screen. The Apple Watch store inside London's Selfridges.

Apple’s MacBooks are the best computers for my needs. So why is the combination of the two such a wretched and chronically compromised situation? Almost every advice column on how to improve MacBook battery life begins with the suggestion to avoid using Chrome in favor of Apple’s more efficient Safari browser. The idea that Chrome is a big and profligate battery drain on MacBooks has existed almost as long as the browser has been available, and most benchmarks reiterate it by showing Chrome’s gluttonous consumption of system resources for seemingly basic tasks. I guess I hoped that by 2015 things would be different. While reviewing the new MacBook Pro with Retina display, I ran the usual Verge battery test on Apple’s new machine. With the screen set to 65 percent brightness, it cycles through a series of websites until the laptop’s battery gives out. The native Safari made the new Retina machine look good: 13 hours and 18 minutes. Google’s Chrome, on the other hand, forced the laptop to tap out at 9 hours and 45 minutes.  Safari lasts three and a half hours longer than Chrome If I’m taking off on a trip from London, then Safari would be with me all the way to Tokyo, Hong Kong, Taipei, or Seoul. Chrome would require a pit stop to recharge somewhere over the Indian subcontinent. Not to put too fine a point on it, but this is insane. It’s the same exact computer. The battery, the processor, the memory — nothing changes but the web browser and the MacBook’s endurance is suddenly scythed down by a whopping three and a half hours. It’s not just the distance you can go with Chrome that’s an issue. The speed and quality of the ride are also compromised. The widely used SunSpider browser benchmark clocks the MacBook Pro in at 203ms when using Chrome. Safari scores 30 percent better with a time of 144ms. Same machine, very different outcomes. You’d think YouTube would be a spot where Google collects an easy win, but that’s been another cause of distress: the new 4K 60fps videos that YouTube now supports are playable on the MacBook, but only — you guessed it — when using Safari and not Chrome. Google’s own browser chokes while playing back video from Google’s own video service. Years of complaints, but little improvement Apple and Google must both bear a portion of the blame for this ongoing disparity. The MacBook maker has a vested interest in promoting Safari as the most efficient, fluid, and pleasing web experience on its platform. Safari will always have the advantage of being optimized for the latest OS X release ahead of any other browser, which means its lead in efficiency will never be completely eradicated. But three and a half hours? That’s the sort of gap that Google should be able to close — if it makes optimization its priority. There’s a certain sense of futility to the words I’m typing. They’re going into a Google Doc nestled within one of many Chrome tabs on a Mac. I live my life in Chrome and in Google apps. The release of Safari 8 made me curious enough to try and switch camps, but Safari’s tab management is atrocious, including the absence of a shortcut to recover more than my last closed tab. It’s the little things that keep me hooked to Chrome, like not having to install any translation extensions or log into Google services once I’m signed into the browser. But if I’m not willing to change, why would Google?

On its site this morning, Apple revealed the pricing for its AppleCare+ warranties for each model of the Watch: $49 for the Sport, $69 for the standard Watch, and $1,500 for the Edition. In the US, those warranties will each give you an additional year on top of what's already included with the watches — one year, unless you buy an Edition, which gets two years of coverage. The extended warranties have to be purchased within 60 days of the purchase of a Watch.  The Edition has a $1,000 service fee on a $1,500 warranty Extended warranties for the Apple Watch work pretty much the same as they have for other Apple products in the past. They include phone support, battery replacement, and parts failures on the smartwatches. More importantly, they cover two instances of accidental damage. Unfortunately, you'll still have to pay a service fee to get a repair for accidental damage: $69 for the Sport, $79 for the standard Watch, and $1,000 for the Edition. Even if you end up paying the service fee twice, MacRumors reports that it's still going to be cheaper than paying a single out-of-warranty service fee for the Sport or standard Watch, which costs $229 and $329 respectively. The report also says that a battery replacement costs $79 across the board if you're out of warranty. Given that the Watch currently seems to make it just until the end of the day, you'll want to hope its battery doesn't wear out too quickly.

Amazon says TV shows, movies, and its own original programming will be available in HDR, which offers more vibrant imagery compared to traditional video output.

The researcher leading this discovery, Tokyo University professor Yasuhiro Kato, said that China's restricted exports are meant to force companies to build inside of the country, where he believes that the state will steal their technologies. A relaxed reliance on Chinese exports could be a major boon for Japan, which uses half of the world's rare earth metal production, reports The Telegraph. Increasing production of rare earth elements continues to be a concern for the United States as well. Earlier this year, the US Department of Energy granted $120 million to create an organization that would investigate new methods of rare earth element production. Though the elements aren't actually rare, they are generally found in tiny amounts and are expensive to mine. Increased earth metal exports from Japan could result in lower prices worldwide, if the country's newly found reserves can help to diminish China's monopoly.",0.5916016458780556,0.40839835412194436,0.8333178781156287,267,5.3408239700374533,173,6.1156069364161851,0,0,"Policy & Law, Science",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The white dwarf can actually survive the explosion Like standard Type Ia supernovas, the new Type Iax variety also happen in binary systems, in which a white dwarf and companion star are locked in orbit around a common center of mass, and in both cases the white dwarf explodes. But surprisingly, in Type Iax supernovas the white dwarf can actually survive the explosion. ""The star will be battered and bruised, but it might live to see another day,"" said lead researcher Ryan Foley. As far as what ultimately causes it to explode, it might be that the helium layer of the companion star ignites, detonating the white dwarf with a shock wave, or the white dwarf might ignite first due to the influence of its helium shell, which could alter the density and temperature of its interior. It turns out that the new supernovas aren’t that rare, they’re just so faint that no one has noticed them until now.

It's now accepted that many of them were covered in feathers, for example, with dinosaurs' role in the evolution of birds more clearly defined. It appears, however, that Jurassic Park 4 director Colin Trevorrow is unconcerned by such discoveries.  No feathers. #JP4  Trevorrow hasn't gone into further details — if the post is legitimate, the director doesn't seem to be the most prolific of Twitter users with only 186 tweets, 2,334 followers, and an unverified account. Presumably he is concerned about preserving the legacy and continuity of Jurassic Park; the original movie wasn't a paragon of scientific accuracy itself, with its six-foot-tall doorknob-turning velociraptors and venom-spitting dilophosaurs. Jurassic Park III, on the other hand, featured velociraptors that had something approaching plumage on their heads and necks, though this was more of a token nod to science rather than strict faithfulness to paleontology. But the simple announcement has sparked some controversy online nonetheless. Science writer Brian Switek took to his Laelaps blog at National Geographic to bemoan the lack of feathers, arguing that the movie will ""turn its back on a critical aspect of dinosaur lives."" ""Velociraptor was definitely a feathery dinosaur, and Tyrannosaurus probably was, as well. In fact, other dinosaurs more distantly-related to birds - such as Triceratops - at least sometimes sported swaths of bristles, quills, or similar body coverings in addition to the pebbly tubercles of their skin. Dinosaurs were far stranger and flashier than anyone expected... if Velociraptor and Tyrannosaurus are reprising their roles, these dinosaurs should certainly have some kind of plumage. That comes right from fossil evidence and evolutionary logic."" Paleontologist Mark Witton agrees, saying on his blog that Jurassic Park 4 will miss a ""terrific chance to affirm modern concepts of dinosaur palaeobiology with a wide audience"" if it leaves out feathers entirely, and questions if Trevorrow's tweet was either a marketing stunt or an attempt to test the waters with the fanbase. After all, there's very little information on the movie as of yet; the Safety Not Guaranteed director's involvement was first reported by Deadline under two weeks ago. Jurassic Park 4 marks a major step up in profile for Trevorrow, and it's understandable that he may want to assuage fans' fears of a radical departure for Jurassic Park. But the nature of the announcement doesn't necessarily bode well for the upcoming movie — as Switek argues, ""there is something undeniably unsettling and scary about envisioning a Velociraptor cleaning blood from its colorful plumage after a kill.""",0.44924783942930585,0.5507521605706942,0.17039716242710679,450,5.402222222222222,295,6.3796610169491528,0,0,"Culture, Entertainment, Science",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Some found twice as likely to reoffend The study used mobile MRI scanners to test inmates' brains for impulsivity; subjects were asked to press a button when they saw the letter X appear on a screen, and do nothing when they saw K.

Unfortunately, the federal government hasn't done a good job keeping track of all of them and the risks they pose. In fact, it doesn't know exactly how many are in operation today, nor how secure they all are. ""This incident highlighted the risks inherent in relying on local building codes."" Those are the grim conclusions of a new report from the Government Accountability Office published today. The report, which follows up on a 2009 review which also found many of the same problems, says that the best, latest estimate of the total number of many high-containment labs in the country is 1,495, and that comes from 2010. The report says that because there is no national standard of security for these labs, they've been built to varying local specifications of security, resulting in several situations at some of these labs that could have been hugely problematic.   In one instance in 2007, construction workers accidentally cut a ""critical grounding cable"" leading to a power outage at a lab with the highest level of biosafety precautions (BSL-4) at the Centers of Disease Control in Atlanta, Georgia. No biological agent was released, thankfully, but as the report notes: ""this incident highlighted the risks inherent in relying on local building codes to ensure the safety of high-containment laboratories, as there are no building codes and testing procedures specifically for those laboratories.""  ""The risk associated with any single laboratory is non-zero."" The report recommends that the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) take control of these labs and set up national standards, but points out this may be made more difficult by recent federal budget cuts. The report also indicates the White House's reluctance to address the problem, saying that the OSTP disagreed that more labs around the US means more risk. ""The risk associated with any single laboratory is non-zero,"" the report concludes, adding, ""The risk at each laboratory leads to an overall increased risk with expansion."" With the US just restarting funding into bird flu research earlier this year after a safety moratorium, it would probably be a good time to make sure labs containing that research are sound.

To be fair, there is no actual clinical condition that occurs from watching the annual NCAA college basketball tournament, the 75th edition of which is now approaching its close. But over four decades of research has shown that these heightened psychological and emotional effects do occur in all sports fans during and after viewing games, rising and falling along with their teams. Even compared to other major sports, the distinctive structure and culture of men's college basketball may make these effects even more pronounced during March Madness. March Madness ""may result in more intense feelings of sorrow or joy for fans."" ""The NCAA college basketball tournament is sort of a unique creature,"" said psychologist Daniel Wann in an interview with The Verge. ""The varying rounds, the brackets, the upsets, the fact that it's single-elimination, loser-go-home. All of that, especially the finality associated with each game, may result in more intense feelings of sorrow or joy for fans.""     Wann, a psychology professor at Murray State University in Murray, Kentucky, specializes in the psychology of sports fandom. To call him one of the leading researchers in the field may be an understatement, considering he's authored or co-authored nearly 200 papers and three books on the subject going back to the late 1980s. The majority of Wann's research has focused on college basketball, using student fans as subjects. Wann says this has been the case more out of circumstance than any preference on his part. Besides Murray State, he has worked out of Kansas University, a school and campus legendary for its large NCAA basketball following. Everything Wann and his colleagues have found in their work indicates that fandom is a unique psychological and emotional phenomena. Unsurprisingly, the most committed fans have the most heightened viewing experiences. ""Overall the more a fan cares, the more intense their reaction to a game is going to be, both positive and negative,"" Wann told The Verge. ""The more a fan cares, the more intense their reaction to a game is going to be, both positive and negative."" In 1993, Wann and University of Kansas psychology professor Nyla Branscombe developed one of the most influential scales for measuring fan commitment, the Sport Spectator Identification Scale (SSIS). Later, Wann came up with a fan commitment index specific to particular teams. The scales ask fans to rate themselves using seven questions, including basic ones like ""how important is being a fan to you?"" Then fans are typically then divided into various groups depending on their own self-ratings, asked to attend or watch games on TV, and asked about their emotional responses afterward. While all that may seem straightforward even to non-fans without psychology degrees, Wann and his colleagues have found some surprising results in the course of their research. For example, in a 1997 study, Wann and another researcher, Michael Schrader, confirmed that die-hard fans derive the most enjoyment from seeing their team win. But counterintuitively, the study also found the emotional responses of die-hard fans who saw their team lose were about the same as those of more casual fan viewers, win or lose. In a 2007 study, Wann and Joshua Polk discovered that die-hard fans tended to be more trustworthy than less committed spectators. And though there are of course limitations to these types of survey questionnaires, recent  brain scans of college basketball spectators conducted by neuroscience researchers at Duke University back up the fact that fans have measurably different emotional responses to game outcomes that even affected their memory of the games. Brain scans of college basketball fans after recalling high-intensity plays, from a 2010 Duke University study. ""These sorts of clinical reactions are rare."" ""There's the happy side and then there's the darker side,"" Wann told The Verge. ""You're always going to have both sides of the coin in sports, whether that's depression or anger from a loss, or euphoria, feeling like you're on top of the world from a win."" Fortunately, as Wann's work has shown, most fans, even die-hards are are able to keep those reactions in perspective and not let them interfere with their lives or the well being of others. ""I'm sure there are a few fans out there who take it too far and go off the deep end with aggression if their team loses,"" Wann said. ""But these sorts of clinical reactions are rare."" ""Given the combination of alcohol and arousal, sports fans are amazingly well behaved."" Wann looked specifically at the characters of highly aggressive, violent, so-called ""dysfunctional fans"" in a 2006 study, finding that they tended to be a ""less educated, lower income, younger, single, with no children at home, male who spends an inordinate amount of his time consuming sports media, and presumably, beer."" These types of fans may also overlap with those who suffer from antisocial personality disorders. But they are far and away in the minority, Wann said. ""It's kind of surprising that there is not more aggression in fans of the NCAA,"" Wann said. ""Given the combination of alcohol and arousal, sports fans are amazingly well behaved."" As for the 2013 March Madness tournament, Wann declined to offer any predictions on how it might be impacting fans of particular teams, but noted that the upsets could have a large effect. ""A whole bunch of the madness is the lack of predictability,"" Wann said. ""Who would have thought Florida Gulf Coast would be in the Sweet 16? There are so many upsets every year.

The crowdfunding campaign launched on Indiegogo last month, but the proposed statue design was just submitted to an Oklahoma state panel this week. It would feature a 7-foot-tall horned figure (Baphomet, a deity long associated with the Satanic movement) sitting on a throne and preaching to two children. And more importantly, it's an interactive statue. As Satanic Temple spokesperson Lucian Greaves explained to The Raw Story: ""The statue will also have a functional purpose as a chair where people of all ages may sit on the lap of Satan for inspiration and contemplation.""  ""people of all ages may sit on the lap of Satan."" Despite these devilish details, the organization claims the project is not just an elaborate prank, and points out they don't actually worship Satan, just the idea of free expression. In that vein, the statue is meant to counterbalance the Ten Commandments statue that was constructed outside the Oklahoma Capitol building in 2012, following years of controversy and debate. Critics of that older monument say it marks a de facto endorsement of Christianity by the state government and therefore violates the US Constitution's ""establishment clause"" against a national religion.  ""By accepting our offer, the good people of Oklahoma City will have the opportunity to show that they espouse the basic freedoms spelled out in the Constitution,"" the group's Indiegogo project site clarifies. For reference, the Satanic Temple also has a long history of these types of public demonstrations. Of course, even if the group raises its target amount of $20,000 by December 17th, it's not clear that the Satanic Temple will ever be able to get the chance to build the statue. Oklahoma lawmakers are not exactly warm to the idea, rushing to enact a temporary ban on new monuments outside the Capitol building late last month. ""I think it is very offensive they would contemplate or even have this kind of conversation,"" one Oklahoma lawmaker told The Raw Story. The Satanic Temple, though, is unswayed: ""The decision by Oklahoma to impose a moratorium on new requests for monuments at the state Capitol means little to us, and our course of action remains the same,"" Greaves wrote on the group's Indiegogo page, arguing that his group's submission still counts because it was filed before the ban.",0.5691286131840521,0.43087138681594794,0.8798307940925248,421,5.1187648456057007,252,6.0714285714285712,0,0,"Culture, US & World",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

""We very much have a voice at the table,"" Pritzker added, saying that President Obama ""would make something public shortly.""  ""We very much have a voice at the table."" Prtizker didn't elaborate on what specific reforms to NSA spying the president was leaning towards, but the one major reform recommended by the review panel — ending bulk collection of Americans' mobile phone records, which includes numbers called, dates, and times — isn't likely to happen anytime soon. That's because the NSA just won court approval to keep collecting all that metadata for the next 90 days. But Prtizker did say that there needed to be a balance between security and privacy, and that the White House was even considering quantifying the economic impact surveillance might have on businesses. ""Inserting a cost-benefit analysis into the process is one of the things that's being considered,"" Pritzker told the panel attendees. ""The president asked for a national conversation on the subject, and we're having it."" Analysts have suggested that the US economy could see anywhere between $35 and $180 billion in losses to cloud-based companies by 2016 from concerns about NSA spying. ""there's an enormous window ... to get immigration reform done."" Pritzker didn't address concerns that the National Institute for the Standards of Technology (NIST), a Commerce Department agency that sets the country's cryptography standards, may have deliberately left standards weak to allow for NSA spying. But during her wide-ranging talk, Pritzker also addressed a number of tech community hot-button issues. She came out strongly in support of reforming the country's immigration system to allow for more ""high skilled"" workers in science and tech, saying ""there's an enormous window in the first half of this year to get immigration reform done."" To that end, Pritzker called upon the Republican-controlled House of Representatives to move forward with a reform bill (the Senate passed its own immigration bill last year). Pritzker also told the audience that the Commerce Department was ""trying to improve your ability to get your patents"" by opening satellite patent offices around the country. Pritzker's talk wasn't all about serious government issues, though. She said she had time to walk the showroom floor and gushed about Qualcomm's UltraSound NotePad, a concept stylus that transfers a person's paper writing to a tablet in real-time.

Police officers and security staff stand guard outside the building. Local news reporters are ready and waiting to ask filmgoers questions like ""Why are you spending your Christmas watching this movie?"" and ""Shouldn't you be spending the day with your family?"" Luckily, I thought ahead and dragged my parents along with me, because it's the holidays. Once inside the theater, we are greeted with an array of little American flags and even more news cameras. The place is in a tizzy. Reporters awkwardly push their cameras in the faces of people in their seats, waiting for the movie. Conveniently, the bright lights from the cameras help illuminate the drink menu a little better. I opt for a Bloody Mary in lieu of their drink special, the ""Supreme Leader Rita"", because it's only 1PM, and I have class. I quickly become distracted by Seth Rogen and James Franco's ""Bound 2"" parody, which is quickly followed by a series of North Korean anti-United States biological warfare children's cartoons.  I momentarily panic. Is something bad happening for real? When I step out briefly to head downstairs, I am greeted not only with more newscasters, but now several firemen. I momentarily panic. Is something bad happening for real? Nobody will tell me what's going on, but I see a fire truck outside. More firemen come in, carrying large tools. It turns out the elevator is stuck, which is weird, because I have never even seen someone use the elevator here. Crisis averted. Once the situation becomes clear, the cameramen quickly find something else to focus on: Tim League, owner and founder of the Alamo Drafthouse has made his entrance in the lobby. He talks to several journalists about the extra security they have in place (though the police officers I had previously seen standing outside have now disappeared), and how this is all about ""freedom of speech, freedom of expression."" He says he feels proud to be a part of the film's hard-fought distribution.   ""You can only get this in a democracy, my friend."" League then disappears — apparently to make a quick outfit change, because when he reappears he's onstage wearing an American flag onesie, throwing prizes out into the audience. He invites 16 ""true patriots"" on stage, by which I mean he bribes 16 people with Budweiser and Four Loko (""you can only get this in a democracy, my friend"") to come sing Lee Greenwood's ""God Bless the USA"" (which he calls ""our true national anthem"") with him. ""You guys are true American heroes!"" he praises. This is shaping up to be the best Christmas ever.  After a quick preview of the Entourage movie, The Interview finally begins. I won't rehash what you can read in other reviews, but I will say that the movie itself is much more entertaining with a large group of people than it would have been otherwise. Also, there is an extremely adorable puppy who is easily the best character in the film. Audience members cheer and wave their tiny American flags throughout the film. I think a ""U-S-A"" chant might break out towards the end, but it never does. The movie ends, and I can't help but feel like a true patriot. I have done a service for my country. I'm not sure what that service is, but I've definitely done it. And it's pretty clear everybody else there felt the same way. ""It blew away our expectations, and a dictator!"" ""We were staying home anyway, so we decided to come see this. But also, like, freedom of speech."" ""Did you know the FBI admitted North Korea wasn't behind the hack and it was just some guys who ended up doing it?"" ""To us it was important to come see it in theaters to show them we're not afraid."" ""It was funny."" I have done a service for my country. I'm not sure what that service is, but I've definitely done it A reporter stops the man next to me. ""At what point did you realize this was an American movement?"" he asks. ""I just wanted to see the movie."" Great response, random dude. You're blowing this for America. It's like you don't even care about this country.    ""Could you feel the patriotism in there?"" another reporter asks. You know what? I could. I really could. Because there's no truer form of American patriotism than the kind that involves being as lazy as possible.

When it was announced the morning that the film would get an online release at 10AM PT, without missing a beat I yelled to my mom in the next room (who I am currently visiting for the holidays) that we would have to cancel a day trip we had planned. Welcome to the hot take workshop: when a story snowballs to the proportion that the Sony hack and near-non-release of The Interview has, a certain kind of professional easily becomes a slave to the feeds and the whims of the individuals at the center of the story. But having now finally watched Seth Rogen, Evan Goldberg, and screenwriter Dan Sterling's film, I can confirm with confidence that the least important element of the story of The Interview is The Interview itself. The Interview was bound to be an emperor-has-no-clothes situation Of course, it was bound to be an emperor-has-no-clothes situation, much like the buildup to any other anticipated Hollywood blockbuster. We have endured a month of the equivalent of trailers and teaser trailers and previews of the teaser trailers courtesy of the Guardians of Peace and Michael Lynton, and as cynical moviegoers, we should be used to the idea that the product at the center of the storm can't stand up to that kind of scrutiny and speculation. The Interview is substandard Apatovian bro-fare to the point of self-parody, full of the offensive Asian accents and dick-joke-a-minute banter one would expect; Lizzie Caplan's CIA agent is a carbon copy of Cecily Strong's ""one-dimensional female character from a male driven comedy"" as seen on SNL's Weekend Update a couple weeks ago, down to the bangs and glasses. It should not be a terribly revelatory statement to claim that a Seth Rogen / James Franco gross-out buddy romp is not a good film, but the story surrounding it has elevated it to the realm of hyperbole. After Sony's initial decision to pull the film, the (completely righteous) indignation over the cowardice of the film industry quickly rendered the discourse in black-and-white. Even as many of us suspected the film was trash, we begrudgingly accepted that The Interview was the most important film of our era, and it was our duty as cineasts to defend and champion it as such. In the past week, the #IWouldGo hashtag sprung up in support of independent theaters screening the film. Either you were first in line for The Interview in whatever form it ended up screening, or you hated America. #YouDontHaveToGo #YouCanGo if you want, but sheesh, #YouDontHaveToGo. Just as it's our right as Americans to put out any dumb, racist, homophobic, misogynistic comedy that also happens to depict the fiery death of a sitting political leader, it's also our right to not give a shit about said comedy. Not only is there nothing revolutionary about The Interview, there is nothing revolutionary about the screening and viewing of The Interview. That's not to say that it shouldn't happen, but let's keep it all in perspective. More than anything, watching the same bros make jokes about gay anal sex for fun and profit actually kinda sounds like business as usual.  The film is not an act of courage. It is not a stand against totalitarianism, concentration camps, mass starvation or state-sponsored terror If you are not the kind of person who would normally go see The Interview, but have been swept up in the mania surrounding it and have a ticket to a brick-and-mortar screening on Christmas Day, maybe take a moment to ask yourself why. Consider spending those two hours with your families or loved ones instead; they probably miss you and love you. If you want to support the cinematic arts on Christmas, that's great — see if you can trade your Alamo ticket for a screening of The Babadook or hey, even Wild. I've heard mixed things, but who isn't rooting for lil' Reese? Good luck at the Oscars this year, Dub-spoon. The Interview is a bad movie that trivializes one of the worst ongoing human rights violations on our planet If you were going to see The Interview even before the GOP tried to take it away from us, then by all means, get out there and have your fun. If I sound judgy, it's because I'm judging you: The Interview is a bad movie that trivializes one of the worst ongoing human rights violations on our planet right now, and its distribution, as integral as it is to our First Amendment rights, will change absolutely nothing. Still, I am a little grateful for the early online release today; it means we can get on with our lives that much sooner.",0.5206810892246097,0.47931891077539035,0.1829444049599169,810,4.7518518518518515,430,6.0302325581395353,0,0,"Culture, Entertainment, Essay",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Head below to see seven of this week's best new trailers, including the first for the Entourage movie.   After a few years off the air, Entourage is coming back — and this time it's headed into theaters. The first trailer for the Entourage movie premiered this week, and it's as wild and bro-heavy as you probably hoped. Plus, there's a first look at Vince's latest extravagant film. It'll be in theaters June 5th.   Breaking Bad fans don't have to wait that much longer to start getting their fill of Saul Goodman again. AMC has been releasing more and more teasers for Better Call Saul as the spinoff series' February 8th premiere approaches, and each one just makes us want to see it even more.   Focus is about Will Smith being a cool dude and a con man and getting mixed up in a convoluted scheme that almost definitely does not turn out well. Con movies always look like a lot of fun, and this trailer certainly plays to that. That said, Focus will be out in February, which is never the most promising sign that a studio has faith in a film.   This isn't Moby-Dick, but it is the story that inspired it. Ron Howard's In the Heart of the Sea is about the huge whale's attack on the ship Essex and its crew's attempt to survive the destruction. Howard seems to be shooting it as though it were a big action film, but it sounds like the film could be more about survival than the trailer lets on. It'll be in theaters on March 13th.   Here's the trailer for the long awaited sequel to SLC Punk!, the cult-classic comedy about punks in Salt Lake City that came out back in 1998. Be warned: this trailer is definitely not edge. The film will be out sometime next year.   Hits is the directorial debut of David Cross, which is reason enough to pay attention to it. The film is a send up of the world's obsession with fame and going viral in the age of YouTube, and a number of great comedians pop up in the trailer to have some fun with it. There's no word on when you'll be able to see Hits, but it sounds like it'll be distributed over BitTorrent's pay bundles.      Helen Mirren and Ryan Reynolds' new film is based on the true story of a woman who tried to recover a famous work of art that had been stolen from her family by Nazis and later wound up in an Austrian museum. Woman of Gold is meant to be a total heart-warmer, and the bad jokes between Mirren and Reynolds weirdly help to sell it. It'll be in theaters April 3rd.

According to the emails — which have come to light thanks to the massive Sony hack, now believed to have been perpetrated by North Korea — Sony had decided that growth prospects for Sony/ATV had diminished, and were discussing a potential sale of the division. Sony's music publishing arm is the largest music catalog in the world, controlling the rights to over 2 million songs, including tracks by Beyoncé, Jay Z, Taylor Swift, Bob Dylan, and the majority of The Beatles' catalog. Sony Entertainment CEO Michael Lynton, Sony Corporation of America president Nicole Seligman, and SCA CFO Steve Kober were leading the sale, according to an email from Kober back in November. ""this is a top-secret project."" The sale was considered ""top secret,"" with details only being discussed between a few high-level executives, according to the emails obtained by Bloomberg. Sony's Tokyo-based executives wrote about their concerns with the complex ownership behind Sony/ATV, and the continuing shift to streaming music. Sony/ATV artist Taylor Swift recently spoke out about the issues with streaming music, and it seems the company that owns her publishing agrees. Sony/ATV is co-owned by Michael Jackson's estate — the late singer purchased ATV music publishing for $47.5 million in 1985 in one of the shrewdest business deals in recent history. 10 years later, Jackson sold Sony a 50 percent stake in the company for $90 million, creating Sony/ATV. In 2012, the group partnered with music mogul David Geffen and Mubadala Development, the investment arm of the Abu Dhabi government to purchase EMI's music publishing division from Citigroup for $2.2 billion, bringing even more ownership parties to the table. Sony/ATV is co-owned by Michael Jackson's estate   Selling the music publisher could help alleviate the stress put on Sony by its mobile division. Sony is expecting to lose over $2 billion this fiscal year — nearly five times what it initially expected to lose — due to its mobile division.

Lucky for us, we'll have plenty to choose from — a bunch of new movies arrive in theaters on the 25th of December. The Verge staff has seen (most of) them, and we are quite prepared to advise you in your yuletide entertainment choices that don't involve The Interview. Who to see it with: Every single person at your Christmas dinner you can manage to drag away from Night At The Museum Holiday spirit threat level: Twenty-eight ""amen""s  Emily Yoshida: There's no way director Ava DuVernay could not have known how incredibly timely her depiction of Martin Luther King, Jr. and the Selma to Montgomery marches would be by the time it hit theaters. But even without the visceral parallels between Selma in 1965 and Ferguson in 2014, the film would still be a sharp, emotionally rendered historical drama. Selma is the best possible kind of Oscar bait, an important film whose actual importance is hard to overstate. Selma is smart enough not to be a biopic; we begin with King (Daniel Oyewelo) winning the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964, and DuVernay doesn't ever condescend to go back to his childhood or his rise through the Civil Rights movement. The film uses one struggle within the movement to tell multiple stories: of the hundreds of families who lost loved ones to racially motivated police violence, of Lyndon B. Johnson (Tom Wilkinson) grappling with his legacy as a president, of Martin and Coretta's (Carmen Ejogo) marriage. But it's its currency, not its breadth, that makes Selma more than just a big-budget school report. Oyewelo's deeply lived-in performance and Cinematographer Bradford Young's warm, expressive palette breaks down the distance of history; parts of the film feel like they could have happened last week. Selma is both upsetting and cathartic, and puts our current events in powerful context.   Who to see it with: Your aunt and uncle that liked The Passion of the Christ a little too much Holiday spirit threat level:  I'm sorry, I can't think about the holidays when I'm watching the screen through my fingers.  Bryan Bishop: When Angelina Jolie decided to film the story of Louis Zamperini, the Olympic athlete who endured almost three years in a World War II prison camp, the project had all the makings of an inspirational holiday tearjerker. Laura Hillenbrand's acclaimed book Unbroken served as source material, everyone from Richard LaGravenese to the Coen Brothers worked on the script, and legendary cinematographer Roger Deakins signed up — guaranteeing some of the most breathtaking visuals of the year. What gets lost in the translation, unfortunately, is humanity. After a brief introduction introduces the mantra ""If you can take it, you can make it"" — the movie's only stab at any deeper insight — Unbroken shifts into pure torture porn mode as Jack O'Connell's Zamperini is beaten, broken, baked, and bullied scene after scene after scene. If you're already familiar with Zamperini's story, the movie will serve as a well-made reminder of all he overcame. For everyone else, however, it will likely come off as a grueling passion play intent on punishing its characters without mercy, intent, or reason. It may be an accurate depiction of the horrors Zamperini endured, but it takes more than that to become the cohesive, inspirational film Unbroken wants to be.   Who to see it with: Anyone in your family with two ears and a deep-seated need to have their childhood viciously and unexpectedly ruined Holiday spirit threat level: Twelve burned storybooks  David Pierce: Once upon a time, many people were afraid Disney would ruin Into The Woods, the much-loved mashup of a thousand fairy tales into a single Stephen Sondheim musical. I can say, with absolute certainty, nothing here is ruined. It's not as good as the play, and a few key moments and characters have been omitted in service of a simpler and more family-friendly story. The play is deeply sexual, deeply subversive, and in many ways deeply strange — that's why it's so great. The movie Into The Woods is something different, something tamer, but still something worth seeing. And it'll permanently ruin Little Red Riding Hood as a children's story. Like, permanently. But the soundtrack is gorgeous, the sets are beautiful, the casting is fantastic, and the Chris Pine is handsome as hell. The movie cuts and moves quickly, then lets the songs unfold over long takes, so every song feels huge and important. The play's defining change of tone at the halfway point feels a little jarring without the presence of the Narrator. Still, with huge set-piece songs that made the audience in my screening spontaneously cheer, and one of the most remarkably bizarre Meryl Streep performances I can think of, it's plenty of fun as a movie. And dear LORD, Chris Pine is handsome.   Who to see it with: The hyperactive tween in your family who literally will not shut up for like two seconds so you can think Holiday spirit threat level: Two fornicating cavemen  David Pierce: I liked the first Night at the Museum. It's a cute, fun, weird idea that was cleverly executed, and there's solid comedic material to be mined from the idea that a thousand years' worth of history's most important people are hanging out in a museum and Owen Wilson is very small. Even in the second movie — when Ben Stiller and his Merry Gang pretty much made all the same jokes in all the same places — I was still on board. But by the end of the third installment, Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb, I realized that maybe it's best if Teddy Roosevelt and his cohorts stay asleep for a while. The movie's fun, in the exact same way the previous two movies are fun. But in an effort to wrap the series up, Secret of the Tomb spends too much time explaining the magic of the tablet and the museum. It tries to become a story about aging, growing up, and moving on, but it comes across heavy-handed and unimaginative. The magic of Toy Story is that it never explains the magic; it's just magic. Knowing how Night at the Museum works kills whatever fun was left to be had.   Who to see it with: Your uncle who never grew up, or your pretentious college buddies home for the holidays Holiday spirit threat level: Very low — unless quotes from The Stranger bring you Christmas cheer  Ben Popper: With a screenplay from the writer behind The Departed and a trailer that reads like a mashup of that film and Rounders, I was prepared for a fun, fast-paced action flick centering around a gambler who can't pay his debts. But The Gambler is actually a remake of the 1974 James Caan film of the same name, and it spends more time on the existential crisis of Wahlberg's character, an English literature professor with a death wish. There are extended monologues about Shakespeare and Albert Camus, none of which sound very believable coming from Wahlberg. There is also precious little gambling intrigue or nuance, since his brutalist style of play involves betting everything, every turn, until his luck runs out. The supporting cast is excellent — Michael K. Williams and John Goodman are great as loan sharks who for some reason decide to stake a clearly suicidal addict. So is Brie Larson, the love interest, a talented student who falls for Walhberg's passionate but tortured persona. But Wahlberg is not quite up to the task of holding it all together, and the whole film falls short as a result.",0.6807643343750512,0.31923566562494876,0.15335064567888987,1321,4.7887963663890991,723,6.0843706777316733,0,0,"Culture, Entertainment",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

""Considering the incredibly challenging circumstances, we are extremely grateful to the people all over the country who came out to experience The Interview on the first day of its unconventional release,"" Rory Bruer, Sony's global distribution president, says in a statement. Sony says that The Interview opened in fewer than 10 percent of the theaters it was originally going to play in — just 331, according to Variety. Many theaters are said to have sold out.  Sony has a lot of money left to make up There's no word on how The Interview performed online, which would have be the most interesting statistic here. Since Wednesday, the film has been available to rent for $5.99 and to buy for $14.99. Given the publicity surrounding The Interview, Sony may actually see some nice returns from online distribution. It's unusual for a major studio film to simultaneously open on-demand and in theaters, which likely caught the attention of potential viewers. The fact that Google called out its distribution of The Interview on its home page certainly should have helped as well. That should all help boost The Interview's early numbers, though it may cut into long-term profits since people are able to watch and buy it at home immediately. Online rentals and sales can only make up for so much lost revenue at the box office, though. In its small number of theaters, The Interview was never going to do particularly well. The Wrap speculates that The Interview should make between $3 million and $4 million by the end of the weekend, and while that's a fine box office figure given its limited release, it's far from what the film would have earned — reportedly estimated to be around $20 million during its opening. That's an issue for Sony, which needs to earn a lot more to make up for The Interview's $44 million budget. Sony may not be able to widely expand the film's release either, as major theater chains aren't going to be happy with The Interview's online release. At this point, Sony may be happy to see anything from this movie, and releasing it now, while there's still controversy and buzz, may have been its best bet. Sony may also have one other Interview problem to deal with: the film is alleged to have used a portion of a song without getting a license for it. But that's probably among the least of Sony's worries right now. There are a lot of people hoping that The Interview's online distribution will work out well for it and begin to convince other studios that this is a viable model. Chances are, given the huge figures The Interview has to take in to make up for its own budget and then actually turn a profit, it won't be that revolutionary release. It seems like the most Sony can hope for is that this is at least an effective release. As of Friday morning, The Interview had fallen to second place on Google's listing on top Play Store films, with Guardians of the Galaxy taking first.

Previous reports suggested that Apple had developed ""a unique Apple Store purchasing experience"" for people who wished to try on the 18-karat edition of its new smartwatch, which is priced at up to $17,000. My experience was certainly pleasant and informative, but it was hardly the ""red carpet treatment"" that many expected — and some feared. I booked my appointment as soon as I got in line this morning at around 8:15AM. The doors of upscale department store Galeries Lafayette were to open at 9, and only two other people were waiting. An Apple employee booked me with the same handset / Apple ID system used to register Genius Bar appointments, and once the doors opened and the first rush of cheers subsided, I was guided to the far end of Apple's section for my fitting. (Four sections of long wooden tables are fanned out across the second level of the building — the first three for the Apple Watch, and the last for iPhones.) Not the Pretty Woman experience I was hoping for A friendly and entirely competent employee ran me through the various sizes and wristbands, which were all displayed under a glass and wooden case. He asked me what I was looking for and how I planned to use the watch (I don't), and then helped me select two models to try on (the most expensive). I then had to wait around for about 20 minutes, because, as was later explained to me, the Watch Editions are kept in an entirely different part of the department store, which is huge. Once they arrived in gray leather boxes, I tried them on over one of the tan leather mats that have been laid atop the tables, but I couldn't actually use the watches because the Editions are not functional. Instead, they play a demo loop and will remain like that once the watches go on sale later this month. (The cheaper models are live.) The fitting was enjoyable enough, but it was far from the champagne-and-strawberries, Pretty Woman treatment I was secretly hoping for. The section wasn't roped off or at all different from the areas where the cheaper Apple Watch and Apple Watch Sport models are displayed, and didn't seem especially ""magical"" to me. Maybe things will be slightly different in Apple's own stores — today's event was only for fittings, no sales until April 24th — but for a watch that costs nearly as much as a college education, the experience was a bit pedestrian.

The screen uses what HP researchers are calling ""directional pixels,"" reports the MIT Technology Review. The directional pixels are made up from nanopatterned grooves on the display that send light off in different directions. HP's display is cut very deliberately — each directional pixel has three sets of grooves that correspond to and direct red, green, and blue light in different directions. From there, the reflected light passes through another, more standard LCD display that turns the light into a moving image.  The display is very much in the early stages, and the images it produces don't look terribly stunning at first glance, but the team behind it still has managed a fairly impressive technical achievement. Static images can be seen in 3D from up to one meter away in a 180 degree field of view, while video playing at 30 frames per second can be viewed from 90 degrees.

According to a study published last week in Current Biology, an area in southwestern Nebraska has seen a marked drop in cliff swallows found as roadkill. At the same time, the average wing length in the group decreased, with one exception: birds who were found dead on the roadside had a wingspan that was ""significantly larger than in the population at large."" One plausible explanation? In areas with roads, cliff swallows tend to nest in overpasses, bridges, or culverts, putting them at risk of death. But those with shorter wings can manage a more vertical takeoff, getting them out of the way of incoming vehicles. If birds with longer wingspans are more likely to be killed, smaller ones could have a reproductive advantage, leading to a larger shift in the population; correspondingly, as long wingspans decline, birds could be less likely to end up as roadkill, explaining the decline. While there are always other possible explanations for finding fewer dead roadside birds, authors Charles and Mary Brown don't believe the populations of scavengers have varied, and other changes would logically point to more dead birds, not less: vehicle traffic either stayed the same or increased, and vehicles are likely to have gotten larger since the study started in 1982. Swallows with shorter wingspans can make more vertical takeoffs, which could help them avoid trucks An alternate hypothesis for finding fewer dead birds is that over 30 years, they've learned to avoid traffic. The authors say they couldn't evaluate this, but that younger birds weren't more heavily represented among the dead ones — which one might expect if the swallows were exhibiting a form of learning. They, however, believe other factors are at work in the birds' declining wingspan. Changing weather or insect patterns, for example, could lead to smaller wingspans.

Scientists today have access to supercomputers capable of running advanced simulations of Earth's climate hundreds of years into the future, accounting for millions of tiny variables. But even with all that equipment and training, they still can't quite figure out how clouds work. That mystery is actually the source of their greatest uncertainty when it comes to accurately predicting how much our planet's temperature will increase, scientists say. ""How much the climate would warm largely depends on how clouds would change in the future,"" said Yen-Ting Hwang, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Washington, in an email to The Verge, noting ""clouds are extremely difficult to simulate.""  ""Clouds are extremely difficult to simulate."" We do know a few things about how clouds behave right now, of course. They're responsible for precipitation, the primary mechanism for moving water around the world. They also provide both warming and cooling effects — trapping heat below and reflecting it from the sun above — and are the drivers of global wind circulation, affecting areas far away from where they are located.   Animated high resolution numerical simulation of a tall cloud forming, from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. But there are still many outstanding questions. ""Why do they form where they do? Why do some form in groups? Why does it rain in one spot not another? These are all very hard questions dealing with very interesting physics,"" says David Romps, a professor of earth and planetary science at the University of California Berkeley.   ""These are hard questions dealing with very interesting physics.""   Romps would know. He received his Ph.D. from Harvard in particle physics. But since 2011, he's been leading a group of six other scientists studying cloud dynamics, splitting his time between UC Berkeley and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, which is the site of the official supercomputer division of the US Energy Department. Recently, his team has been focusing on the question of vertical velocity, or how fast clouds rise. ""This is really basic information that's hard to come by, because people haven't until recently wanted to fly planes up in into the upper troposphere [4 miles to 9 miles in altitude], and we didn't have the right instruments,"" he said. Hwang, for her part, works out of the University of Washington's Atmospheric Sciences Division, a member of which literally wrote the book on cloud dynamics back in the 1990s. Hwang and her advisor published a paper earlier this month that found clouds were key to resolving another longstanding problem, improving the accuracy of future rainfall predictions of the tropics, which are expected to become much wetter as the temperature rises. ""The tropics are also where many of the most vulnerable ecosystems and societies are, so it’s especially important to know how things will change there,"" wrote Dargan Frierson, Hwang's advisor, an associated professor at UW, in an email. ""In some respects [we're] racing the clock here."" Aside from these teams, there are several hundred other scientists in the wider field of cloud dynamics and atmospheric sciences working furiously to unravel the mystery of how clouds affect, and are affected by, the changing climate. ""We know very well that we're in some respects racing the clock here,"" Romps said. ""Whether we like it or not, we're going to see what the outcome of increased CO2 is going to be on this planet. But we'd like to get some predictions before that behavior arrives.""   Animated high resolution numerical simulation of a tall rain cloud forming, from Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.   These scientists rely on a few main tools for their work. The big one is something called a general circulation model, a type of complex mathematical equation that can be used by a supercomputer to simulate the natural cycles of the entire planet. The models are used by the UN and most scientists around the world to predict climate change. The problem is, most of these can only simulate atmospheric phenomena larger than 62 miles (100 kilometers) wide in size, while most clouds are considerably smaller, 0.62 miles (1 kilometer). ""The analogy I give people is, imagine if you were handed a Lego block and asked to make a full scale model of a gnat,"" Romps said. ""You can't, the block is too big.""  ""You can kind of play God in a way."" So Romps and other atmospheric scientists have to use smaller-scale models to simulate clouds. One type, called a convective parameterization, uses observational data of real clouds gathered by satellites and planes. Another type of model, a high-resolution numerical simulation, essentially turns cloud science into a video game. ""You can kind of play God in a way, go in and kick up certain winds, make certain forces pick up from the ocean,"" Romps explained.

As usual, Lego managed to stand out with its ware, but this year is a little bit different for the block company. Unlike recent years, when fans couldn't expect boatloads of nostalgic homages to the likes of Ghostbusters or The Simpsons. Instead, many of Lego's wares were tailor made for the upcoming blockbuster season. Not that there's anything wrong with that.   The set for Jurassic World caught our eye since it shows off the elusive über-dinosaur Indominus rex in all its glory, but the entire set includes the requisite velociraptors and Chris Pratt figures. Elsewhere, we saw sets for Avengers: Age of Ultron, complete with Iron Man's Hulkbuster armor, as well as a set for Ant-Man, which featured scaled-up versions of the Lego bricks for his miniaturized self alongside the normal ones. We also saw plenty of revamped Star Wars sets, but we'll have to wait until later this year to see designs for The Force Awakens. Take a look. T-Rex Tracker will sell for $69.99 later this year. The massive Indominus Rex set will sell for $129.99 this May. Raptor Rampage, complete with a diminutive Chris Pratt, will go for $49.99. Dilophosaurus Ambush will cost $29.99.

When its engineers found such vulnerabilities, Google would originally give the developers a strict 90-day window to issue a fix, before making an exploit or security hole public. At the time of launch, the search giant believed the timeframe would give developers enough time to cook up a fix, but in the face of criticism, it's now extended that 90-day period. If developers contact Google and indicate that a fix is being put together, but won't be ready in time for the 90-day window, then they can receive another 14-day grace period in which to put a patch out without the security hole being made public. Google has also agreed to move deadlines that fall on weekends or national holidays to the next concurrent working day, and has said in extreme circumstances, it will move deadlines forwards or backwards. Microsoft criticized Google for outing a security flaw in Windows 8.1 two days before a patch The change comes a month after Microsoft openly criticized Google for publishing information on a Windows 8.1 vulnerability two days before it was scheduled to be fixed. Microsoft said Google's approach was ""less like principles and more like a 'gotcha,'"" arguing that customers would suffer as a result. After making details of another security flaw in Windows 8.1 public before Microsoft could ready a fix in December last year, Google defended its 90-day period, telling Engadget that its disclosure deadlines were ""currently the optimal approach for user security."" The slight tweaks to the policy now give developers slightly more time to complete their work, but Google is by no means the most demanding of all security research groups when it comes to zero day discoveries. Google says its 90-day policy is a ""middle-of-the-road deadline timetable"" in comparison with its industry peers.

In October, PETA launched the Air Angels program, a line of drones meant to let concerned citizens report illegal activity by hunters. Hunting groups pushed back and, as of January 1st, the program has been made illegal in Illinois with a law prohibiting ""the use of drones to interfere with hunters or fishermen."" The only problem: PETA isn't buying it. ""It's being done on public land in a nonresidential area."" According to Jared Goodman, PETA's director of animal law, Air Angels aren't about interference at all. ""The intention is simply to monitor what hunters are actually doing,"" Goodman says, ""and whether they're engaged in any illegal activity, such as drinking in possession of a firearm or illegally using spotlights or feedlures."" If they spot any illegal activity, PETA members are advised to report it to a local game warden and not take any further action themselves. As a result, PETA is eager to challenge the new law, but even more eager to test out the project in states. Hunting groups like The US Sportsman's Alliance, which has applauded the Illinois law, aren't so sure. ""PETA's approach here was essentially just to get some press,"" says CEO Nick Pinizzotto. He says his members were incensed by the idea of the project, but he hasn't heard any instances of hunters actually being harassed by the drones. (Goodman, in his defense, says ""dozens"" of the Air Angels have been sold through PETA's website.) ""I don't think Americans in general appreciate being spied on."" Still, the legal issues are thorny enough to cause problems even without widespread hunter-watching programs. If the Illinois law is challenged, it's not clear hunters would be able to appeal on privacy grounds. ""It's being done on public land in a nonresidential area,"" Goodman says. ""There's no reasonable expectation of privacy there. Any other hunter who's on the same land could see the same thing."" It might be more unnerving to be watched by a drone than a person, but the legal distinction is less clear, which presents regulators with real uncertainties as they look to draw up rules for the bots. Even if the law isn't settled, Pinizzotto is sure public opinion is on the side of hunters. ""I don't think Americans in general appreciate being spied on, whether it's hunting or anything else,"" he says. ""People are really concerned about the idea of drones.

On Friday, Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) asked NSA head Keith Alexander if the agency was ""spying,"" or had ever spied, on American Congress members or other elected officials. Today, the NSA provided an equivocal answer, promising that Congress has ""the same privacy protections as all US persons. ""NSA's authorities to collect signals intelligence data include procedures that protect the privacy of US persons,"" reads the statement, provided to The Guardian. ""Such protections are built into and cut across the entire process. Members of Congress have the same privacy protections as all US persons. NSA is fully committed to transparency with Congress.""

The NSA said that it was ""reviewing"" the letter and would work to give Sanders and other members of Congress more information, but it didn't deny using any of the above surveillance techniques. If anything, saying that Congress members receive the same protections as other citizens implies that their information is indeed being collected and could theoretically be queried as part of an investigation. Previously, US intelligence agencies have been found to have monitored the phones of national leaders abroad, including German chancellor Angela Merkel. ""Members of Congress have the same privacy protections as all US persons."" Members of Congress have expressed varying degrees of knowledge about the NSA's surveillance programs. After the first leaked documents appeared in June, President Obama, Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), and others said that Congress had been briefed extensively, but one representative said he hadn't been given crucial documents before voting on a reauthorization of the FISA Amendments Act, which expanded the intelligence community's powers. The issue was further obfuscated in a March 2013 Senate hearing, where Director of National Intelligence James Clapper falsely denied that the NSA had collected data on millions of Americans. Since then, lawmakers in both houses have expressed outrage, calling for his resignation and an official Department of Justice investigation. The phone records collection Sanders references, meanwhile, is hotly contested in court. In December, two judges in New York and Washington, DC issued directly conflicting rulings on whether mass metadata surveillance constitutes an illegal search, and both the ACLU and Department of Justice have filed appeals against their respective losses.

Following the first legal sale of recreational marijuana in the United States in over a century, governor Andrew Cuomo is set to announce an executive action that will loosen restrictions on marijuana, according to The New York Times. According to the report, the policy will be very strict: only 20 hospitals across the state will be granted permission to prescribe marijuana to those with cancer, glaucoma, or any other disease explicitly approved by the state's Department of Health.  The state currently has some of the tightest policies regarding weed — according to the Marijuana Policy Project the state has the second highest number of arrests per capita for charges related to the substance. While possession below 25 grams is not a criminal offense, if it's burned or otherwise viewable in public it's an arrestable offense. It's a shift for Governor Cuomo, who's been opposed to medical marijuana, though he's said before that he has an open mind on the matter. The issue has come to the fore recently with both Colorado and Washington legalizing recreational use of weed, and subsequent research showing that an estimated 58 percent of Americans support legalization. Cuomo's decision is a very small step towards legalization, but it should open up use of marijuana when needed. By opting to use an executive action, Cuomo is bypassing the Republican-led state Senate, which has blocked medical marijuana bills in the past. The announcement is expected to come on Wednesday during the governor's State of the State address, but any new rules would take some time to take effect: the state would need to find a supplier of weed, as well as select which hospitals to bring into the program. The limited nature of the program speaks to Cuomo's view on the matter: a source tells The New York Times that it is a test designed to allow authorities to monitor the effects of allowing medical marijuana in the state.",0.6880094846424449,0.31199051535755506,0.9048634439259339,335,4.964179104477612,204,5.9803921568627452,0,0,"Policy & Law, US & World",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

Leaks from Edward Snowden reveal a $79.7 million research program called ""Penetrating Hard Targets,"" including classified funding to research a quantum computer that could be used for cryptography. The Post says that much of the research is being done at the University of Maryland's Laboratory for Physical Sciences, but not much more is revealed about the program, including how far quantum computing work has actually progressed. Quantum computing hinges, very broadly, on allowing individual bits (called qubits) to contain superimposed values of zero and one, vastly increasing computing power. Its implications for cryptography, medicine, and research have made it a major goal for public services and private industry alike: DARPA has devoted years of funding to quantum computing research, and Google launched its own ""Quantum Artificial Intelligence Lab"" last year. But while qubits have been stored for a limited period of time under certain conditions, and specialized machines have been built using quantum technology, that's not enough for practical code-breaking applications. Last year, for example,The Economist all but ruled out the possibility that the NSA had a crypto-ready quantum computer. The NSA's program, part of the larger intelligence community ""Black Budget,"" doesn't actually task anybody with building a quantum computer. According to the memo, it asks researchers to ""conduct basic research in quantum physics and architecture/engineering studies to determine if, and how, a cryptographically useful quantum computer can be built."" So while the grant fits with the NSA's general mission — and quantum computing could one day pose a real threat to present-day encryption methods — it's a lot more theoretical than the agency's ability to, say, seed malware to computers from miles away.

Now you've got some free time to kill, and there's one obvious place to look: Netflix. Marco Polo may not have turned out so well, but Netflix has still added a pretty great selection of new and classic movies over the past month. Here are 10 favorites for you to consider when you're searching for something to watch.   This is the British sci-fi series that has everyone talking. Black Mirror just hit Netflix this month, making the holidays your perfect chance to catch up. It’s a show about our obsession with technology and how the effects of that can easily get out of hand. Things get pretty crazy, pretty quickly. Just watch it.  If you aren't familiar with director Bong Joon-ho, now's the time to make your introduction. Snowpiercer, his first English-language film, came out this summer and is now on Netflix. It's a smart, energetic, and action-packed sci-fi picture with great directing and a cool enough world (literally just a giant, futuristic train) to keep you onboard for the entire ride.  If you don’t care for ponderous meditations on plastic bags wafting in the breeze, you at least have to give Kevin Spacey his due for his incredible performance in this movie. American Beauty follows Lester Burnham, a suburban milquetoast who falls in love with his underage daughter’s friend, catalyzing his need to reinvent himself. It’s stylistically striking, funny, and heartbreaking in ways you’ve heard all about before, but should experience if you’ve never had the opportunity.  Martin Scorsese's latest film is a wild one. Like, seriously, parents: don't watch this with your kids, and kids: don't watch this with your parents. But maybe find someone you're comfortable with and take a look. It's a strange, overlong send-up of everything that's wrong with Wall Street, and it's all at once alluring and infuriating to watch.  Cameron Crowe's classic about rock and roll and growing up, Almost Famous is a must-watch if it's somehow still on your to-watch list and an obvious re-watch if you just haven't seen it in a while. Just check out that soundtrack and cast. What's not to like?  A Knight's Tale is both terrible and delicious. In fact, the reason it's delicious is every bit a product of how terrible it is. The constant rock music — and dance breaks to rock music — in the middle of Medieval England are key, but so is Heath Ledger's haircut and Shannyn Sossamon's anachronistic fashion. After all, A Knight's Tale isn't a drama. The love story and Ledger's quest to win a jousting tournament are important, but they ultimately takes a backseat to the comedy. No one watches A Knight Tale to be serious. You watch it for the fighting, for the early 2000s heartthrobs, and for Alan Tudyk's brilliant slapstick comedic performance.  Ida follows a woman who is just days from becoming a nun when she discovers that her birth parents were Jews. It's a film about life in Poland years after the Holocaust, but it's also about one woman, Ida, figuring out who she is and what her vows really mean. It's easily among the most beautiful films you'll see this year.  For many AHS fans, this is where things started to go off the rails, but that doesn’t mean there weren’t incredible moments and performances. As with previous seasons of this anthology series, Coven follows the descendents of Salem witches who wield powerful and deadly magic. As with all Ryan Murphy shows, there’s plenty that’s over the top, but Kathy Bates, who won an Emmy for this season, makes up for it.  In this sequel to 2010’s The Trip, Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon go on a trip through the Italian countryside, enjoying food and joking along the way. You could easily say ""That’s it,"" but the comic dynamic between the two is infectious. You can’t help but laugh at them riffing off each other, and you almost wish you were along with them for the ride.  For many of us, the high school reunion is the time to either show off or just not show up. Romy and Michele are in the same boat in this film, but concoct new identities to show off to the popular kids that tormented them in school. Of course, the dance scene to Cyndi Lauper’s ""Time After Time"" makes the film. Watch this and relive the memories.",0.8968863069912469,0.10311369300875306,0.1319966608997034,748,4.7098930481283423,437,5.8466819221967965,0,0,"Culture, Entertainment",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Kamau Bell is podcasting about it.  On December 20th, gunman Ismaaiyl Brinsley allegedly shot and killed two New York City police officers in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn. He later killed himself. The murders came after weeks of nationwide protests against law enforcement in America, with people taking to the streets to denounce the shooting deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner and the non-indictment of the police officers involved, and reports indicate that Brinsley committed the killings as revenge against law enforcement at large. With these new killings, the tenor surrounding the situation had changed in one fell swoop.  The shootings gave Bell pause, but also a chance to find a new platform. He’d already, in his small way, taken part in the protests. He also discusses race and law enforcement in his work. In a recent Vanity Fair piece, Bell say he’s “petrified of the cops,” and describes his fear as a cultural inclination, a means of survival. But it was when he got to speak candidly with retired LAPD police officer Anthony Escobar in September, two months before the Michael Brown grand jury decision that he felt like he had something worth saving and one day sharing. ""I’d never had that kind of unfettered access to a police officer where I never felt like he was going to turn on me or arrest me or murder me,"" Bell told me over the phone. The conversation turned into an hour-long podcast he calls Coptalk, and it seemed like the right thing to help bridge the yawning gap between police and the communities they serve. But when two cops die and the president of the Patrolmen’s Benevolent Association says protesters and the mayor himself have blood on their hands, what can a podcast hope to achieve? He’s is still figuring that out, but releasing it feels like a step in the right direction. ""There’s a part of me that goes, ‘Is this actually the wrong time to put this out?’"" he told me, letting me in on his doubt. ""But I sort of feel like I can’t sit on this any longer."" Coptalk was made and released through the EarWolf Podcast Network this week, which hosts popular shows like the Comedy Bang! Bang! podcast. Bell calls his effort the first episode of a new series, but he isn’t sure what episode two will look like yet. In fact, he doesn’t seem to have a fully realized plan. All he knows is that this show just needed to be out there now. ""It was just about trying to focus on what it’s like to be a cop in these situations and what is it like to be a person who’s not a police officer [and] just walked into the neighborhood,"" Bell told me. ""And I certainly don’t think that we addressed that in that hour-long conversation. I think there’s more we could address. I just want to add this to the conversation."" Sharing this conversation via podcast, as opposed to, say, an appearance on Meet the Press, felt right and in keeping with the media landscape today. There’s something to the DIY-ness, he says, of making something important without worrying about production values. Bell even cited Serial, the true crime podcast that quickly became the fastest-growing show in the medium, for giving him the opportunity to make something he feels is powerful and his own. ""I think the one thing Serial did was it started conversations about the criminal justice system,"" he said. ""Now, it didn’t have to do necessarily with police brutality or abusive cops. I don’t know that it addressed the racist side of the criminal justice system. In my mind, that’s not their job."" He laughs. ""That’s my job."" Over the course of their talk, Bell and Escobar converse frankly about how police and communities (particularly communities of color) interact. Escobar even gives a first-person perspective on how law enforcement is trained to use the weapons at their disposal — billy clubs, tasers, and guns — when faced with the kind of threat Michael Brown was said to have posed. The discussion can be hard to hear at times, especially in light of how the case panned out. It’s even clear that the two disagree on fundamental points, and Bell concedes that the show could have also been called ""Trigger Warning."" It might be too much for some people. But that's okay. For him, the key part of this discussion was that there was some attempt to reach consensus. It’s the kind of discussion we need more of. ""Sometimes the best thing we can do is shut the fuck up and listen to other people,"" he said. ""I think we live in a time where, with social media and Twitter, everybody has an opinion. It would have been really easy for me to sit down with Anthony and go ‘No no no no no.’ Even times when I disagreed with him, it was just like, 'No, let me let him talk and get his point across.' And I think the challenge of doing more of this podcast is [finding] other cops who are as open as he was."" He continued, ""I think if we did more of these [podcasts], we’d do them live, and I think we’d start to go around the country and go to the places where they need to talk to the police who patrol that community. The problem is can we get cops to sit down at that table? I got lucky."" Truthfully, Bell doesn’t have much hope that cop-community relations can change much in the near term. ""Unfortunately right now, people think we’re an occupied nation negotiating with the police, as opposed the the police being our servants,"" he said.  But, as a comedian with a platform who’s used to ""spitting into the wind,"" it’s enough for him to try to build something that can effect change. ""We are at a critical time, and you have to be open to all new ideas and all new ways to solve the problem,"" he said. ""Because you don’t know where the solution’s gonna come from. Obviously people are dying, and it seems like every day. That’s why I felt like I couldn’t sit on this any longer. This may be the first step toward us working on this show and figuring out what we can do here. This is my way.""

It should also support some more advanced features with Google's own iOS apps, like replying to Gmail messages.  The LG G Watch R with a FaceTime notification from iOS But beyond that, there are plenty of unanswered questions. Pebble, who makes a smartwatch that works with both Android and iOS, has managed to get features like music control and watch apps working on its smartwatch with the iPhone. So it's possible that Google could do the same. Some third-party developers have already hacked together a solution that makes Android Wear work on iOS. Another developer has discovered ""iOS related code"" in Android 4.4 that he believes implies that Google has been working on iOS compatibility for Android Wear. Last October, Android Wear product manager Jeff Chang didn't rule out the possibility that Google could be working on it, telling The Huffington Post that ""We always want as many users as possible to enjoy our experience, so in terms of enabling more people to use Android Wear we're very interested in making that happen."" ""Apps or metadata that mentions the name of any other mobile platform will be rejected.""  But a bigger question is whether or not Apple would actually approve the companion app into its App Store. Certainly it doesn't have much incentive to do so in the middle of the launch of the Apple Watch, its biggest product launch in years. Google and Apple have a history of contentious app approval processes — Google's Voice app and Maps app have had issues in the past — though it's been quite awhile since the two companies have butted heads over apps. But here's another possible problem: way back in 2010 it came out that Apple may reject apps that mention competing platforms. It specifically rejected an app for mentioning Android. The guideline still exists today. Since Android Wear is called, well, Android Wear, that could be a problem. Apple declined to comment for this story. Google said it ""has nothing to announce at this time."" Meanwhile, we've also heard that Android Wear for Android will be getting a significant update in the near future, including support for gestures and Wi-Fi.

Also available on YouTube)   Apple's latest laptop is simply called the MacBook.   Actually, I suppose, you're going to see everybody refer to it as ""the new MacBook"" for a little while, but that's just temporary. The name is a signal. Apple could have called it the MacBook Air 12-inch or the MacBook Slim or any number of other things. But instead, it’s the MacBook. That has to mean something.  You are really, really going to want this laptop, even though it's relatively expensive, starting at $1,299. It’s easily the most impressive laptop I’ve seen since the original MacBook Air. It’s almost unbelievable in every regard. How did Apple make it so thin? What dark magicks make this trackpad work? Is it really going to be fast enough? Why is there only one port? Every one of those questions has an interesting answer, and the mere fact that a laptop can still engender this much intrigue in 2015 is remarkable.  After using this tiny little wonder of a computer for a little over a week, I have a pretty strong guess about what the name means. It’s called the MacBook because Apple sees it as the Platonic ideal of what a laptop should be. It’s what Apple believes all laptops should eventually become.  But if you know anything about Platonic ideals, you know that there's a big difference between the ideal and the reality. And so the big question for this tiny new MacBook is simple: is the reality anywhere close to the ideal?  The MacBook is what happens when the iPad Air decides to up and grow a keyboard, hinge, and trackpad. It's a thin, compact, and light sliver of a machine with no loose pieces and no unconsidered lines. The same precision we've seen on Apple's phones and tablets has been applied here — it's genuinely a level above any other laptop Apple has ever made, to say nothing of other hardware makers. It is, in a word, beautiful. A thin machine with no loose pieces and no unconsidered lines It's almost impossibly thin, measuring just over 13mm at its thickest point. It's even more impossibly light, weighing just over two pounds. That's about a full pound less than the 13-inch MacBook Air and a third of a pound less than the 11-inch Air. And that weight is perfectly distributed across the deck of the laptop and the screen. It's so well-balanced that it feels lighter than it actually is. People who use the 11-inch Air are going to feel right at home, and actually people who use the 13-inch Air will, too. It just feels like the ideal size for a small laptop, perfectly fitted to a full-sized keyboard and not a whit bigger. Apple also redesigned the hinge so that it is made of metal, increased the size of the trackpad, and moved the speakers (which are reasonably loud, but obviously lack anything resembling bass) up above the keyboard. It comes in gold, silver, and space gray. I got a gold review unit because, well, why not? I think it totally works. It's much more restrained in person than you might think, but honestly I'd probably end up choosing the space gray model. To pull off this design, Apple's marketing video will tell you that it required a lot of inventions. The keyboard, trackpad, screen, and batteries all needed to be redone to make the MacBook as thin as it is. And in every one of those cases, you can safely believe the hype. But the flip side of invention is compromise, and unfortunately there's enough of that here that I have to leaven the enthusiasm I've been expressing thus far with a warning: it's not all wonderful. Invention and compromise. But let's stick with the inventions for now, because they truly are remarkable. It starts with the keyboard, which is shallower than what you might be used to. Underneath each key is a butterfly mechanism, a ""steel dome"" that registers your keystrokes, and an individual backlight for every single key. At first, I hated it. It felt weird to have each button move so little when I pressed down on it. But it didn't take long at all for me to change my mind. The combination of all those new parts meant that the essential friction and ""clack"" that make up any great keyboard is still here, just different than what I was used to. I can bang away on this thing or type more softly, and both feel completely satisfying. The only real hassles are the redesigned up and down arrow keys: they're entirely too small. The next thing is the screen, a 236 ppi Retina display that's 2304 x 1440 pixels. The invention here is that it's thinner and brighter thanks to rearranged electronics inside, and it's also more energy efficient. The thinner screen also means that the Apple logo on the back of the laptop no longer lights up, if that's something you care about. But ignore those specs and just look at it: it simply puts the screen on the MacBook Air to shame. The redesigned keyboard will grow on you It's sharp and bright, and Apple also switched the bezels to black to match the rest of the Retina MacBook lineup. Those bezels are thin, too, so the combination makes the screen feel really big. You can set the resolution all the way up to 1440 x 900, so it's effectively giving you the same real estate as the 13-inch MacBook Air. You can’t crank it up to the full resolution, but you wouldn’t want to anyway, since it would make everything way too small. The Force Touch Trackpad feels like an impossible object. It has tiny pads that detect pressure, and then an electromagnet inside that simulates the feel of a click when you press down. So when the laptop is off, you feel nothing. When it's on, click. It's all in service of thinness — and some clever software features. You can set the click strength in settings and also turn on a bunch of unique features for it in OS X. Force clicking (as it's called) lets you open up web page previews on links or definitions for words. You can also step through fast-forward speeds on videos and even feel some haptic feedback in a select few apps, like iMovie. Honestly, none of those software tricks felt very intuitive to me. But the trackpad itself felt completely natural, easily up to Apple's standards. In fact, it feels better than normal for a MacBook, since you can now click on the very top of it as easily as the bottom. The Force Touch Trackpad feels like an impossible object There are other inventions, too. Apple redesigned its batteries to be tiered, so they can cram more of them into the MacBook. The result is a claimed nine hours of battery life — a claim that's notably close to my experience. In our relatively light test, which reloads websites once a minute, this MacBook actually beat Apple's claims by about an hour or so. But when you're putting it under stress, you'll get a bit less, probably closer to eight hours. But here's where the inventions, while impressive, begin to feel more like those compromises. Apple created an all new, tiny little circuit board to house all the microchips that power the MacBook. It means that it doesn't need a fan at all, but it also means that using the kind of processor we're used to on modern laptops isn't really tenable. Instead, the processor on the MacBook is an Intel Core M, clocked at 1.1GHz but with a Turbo Boost mode that can crank it up to more than twice as fast (and there are other, more expensive variants that can go even faster). Hence the compromises: the MacBook benchmarks at about the same level as a four-year-old MacBook Air. That sounds dire, but in my experience it doesn't feel anywhere near that slow — mostly. Fast enough for most common tasks, but it gets warm if you push it Basically, if you do anything that’s going to really tax the processor, this laptop probably isn't going to cut it for you. In that sense it's actually kind of like a Chromebook. It's fast enough for 70 percent of what I do, but a little slower than what I'm used to. For about 20 percent of what I do — mostly photo editing — it works but requires patience. But it's the last 10 percent that's hard: video editing, really big iPhoto libraries, basically anything processor-intensive can get rough. I'll also say that the Chrome browser is kind of the perfect app to show where the line is between ""good enough"" and ""kind of slow."" Chrome has really become something of a resource hog for me lately. It’s not a problem most of the time, but load up enough tabs, and any computer will start to chug. On my MacBook Air, that happens at around 20 tabs. On the new MacBook, it’s about half that. Safari runs much better, but the point is that the headroom for apps that hog resources is much smaller than what I'm used to. And in any case, the fact that it's fanless means that the laptop gets warm. I wouldn't say hot, but it’s definitely riding that line of comfort for bare legs. Fortunately, the heat is localized to where that processor cranking into turbo boost is located: on the bottom, near the back. The tiny board, the fanless design, the fact that it can power this Retina display at all — all these inventions are impressive. But being impressed and being able to get work done are not the same thing. It's a compromise I can't promise you is okay unless you're sure you're not going to push a machine beyond the basics and can stand to wait for those times when you need to. Which leads me to the last invention / compromise: the new MacBook has a new port, called USB Type-C. It's also the only port besides the headphone jack. You use it for power and for connecting your phone, monitor, printer, camera, or whatever else you might have. And because it's a brand new kind of plug, you will need adapters for all of those things. Say you want to charge your computer, plug in your iPhone, and plug in an external monitor. That's a totally natural thing to want to do! To pull it off, you are going to need to have the right dongle — and you’re going to need to buy it, too, since they don’t come in the box. They're just beginning to come on the market now, and I’m hopeful they’ll be both cheap and plentiful, but so far I've only been able to use the basic ones. So, just by way of example, right now I can't plug my Apple MacBook into my Apple Cinema Display because I don’t have a dongle with Display Port on it. Again, this is an invention and a compromise, and it's one that I'm actually a little torn on. USB Type-C has a legitimate chance of being the One Connector To Rule Them All. Google and Nokia are already using it, other phone and laptop manufacturers are on board, and from a technical standpoint it's a really great plug. It's strong, it’s reversible, it's fast from both a data and power perspective, and it's not proprietary. I charged the new MacBook with Google's power adapter. Heck, I charged the new MacBook off one of those battery bricks that's meant to power an iPad. Sure, I miss the safety of the MagSafe adapter, but being able to buy any number of chargers and adapters from whomever makes the cheapest or best ones is a big deal — and worth the tradeoff. Or will be, once USB Type-C takes hold. Apple says that it designed the MacBook with the idea that soon you'll be able to connect everything wirelessly anyway. The iPhone can sync wirelessly or use AirDrop, lots of cameras support Wi-Fi, etc, etc. That all sounds nice, but I can tell you from painful experience that the dream of wireless peripherals is usually more like a waking nightmare of confusing sync settings, delays, and frustration. The MacBook supports Bluetooth 4.0 and an alphabet of Wi-Fi standards, but that's not enough, not yet. Talking to other Verge staffers about it, I joked that I'm looking forward to ""Livin' La Vida Dongle."" That's almost true! When it comes down to it, I mostly plug in power and only rarely need to use an SD card reader or plug in some other USB device. But when I need it, I need it, and having to carry a rat's nest of adapters and cables puts a huge damper on the portability of this machine. A lot of people remember the moment when Steve Jobs pulled the original MacBook Air out of that interoffice memo envelope. It was jaw-dropping. But it's easy to forget that the very first MacBook Air had problems — some of the very same problems as this new MacBook: not enough ports, slow, expensive. But the next version became the MacBook Air you know now, the one everybody either uses or copies. The one that changed laptops for five years. This new MacBook is the future. All laptops are going to be like this someday: with ridiculously good screens, no fans, lasting all day. Just like the original MacBook Air defined a generation of competitors, this new MacBook will do the same. It, or something inspired by it, is what you'll be using in two or three years. It's that good.  All laptops are going to be like this someday  Here's a crazy surprise I didn't expect: my 13-inch MacBook Air felt big and clunky after I went back to it. And make no mistake, the MacBook Air is itself a wonder of engineering. Yet compared to the new MacBook it felt like a heavy, kind of ugly throwback with a mediocre screen. I really didn't want to go back to that Air. But I still went back. You see, the problem with the future is that it isn't here yet. Instead we live in the now, and the now doesn't have the ecosystem of adapters and wireless peripherals I need to use this laptop with its single port. The now doesn't have the right processor to power through the apps I need without ruining battery life. And right now, this laptop is far from cheap at $1,299. But if history is any guide, all of those problems will go away — and more quickly than you probably expect. When they do, I'll be using this MacBook. The MacBook. Hurry up, future. Hurry the hell up.  ",0.5826674547050817,0.41733254529491826,0.1547148513283972,2500,4.5027999999999997,979,5.9039836567926454,0,28,"Apple, Tech, Review",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Now, Microsoft is ready to announce further integration with Dropbox: as of today, you'll be able to view your Dropbox documents when using Microsoft's free Office Online apps. This means that if Dropbox is your preferred place to store files, you'll be able to access and edit them when using either Microsoft's mobile apps or its web apps. Until now, there's been a bit of a disconnect in that you've been able to access and edit those Office docs on mobile, but not through your browser, something that's been done away with now in Dropbox's ongoing quest to support as many services as possible so people can access their files no matter what platform or tool they're using.  ""Our philosphy is to give people the ability to work with the tools they want,"" says Dropbox's Ilya Fushman, ""and Office is clearly the world's biggest productivity suite."" Indeed, there's good incentive for Dropbox to work closely with Microsoft — Fushman said that more than 35 billion Office documents were stored in Dropbox when the partnership was announced last fall. He also noted that Dropbox integration was the number one request from users of Microsoft's mobile and web apps when they launched, making this collaboration a pretty natural one. Microsoft and Dropbox's mutually beneficial partnership continues Now that Office Online and Dropbox are all linked up, users will be able to either find files through the Office Online interface, or simply find them through Dropbox's web site — either way, they'll open up in Microsoft's web apps. Of course, Office files saved in your Dropbox locally on your computer will open in Microsoft's Office apps, just as they always have. This isn't a groundbreaking change, but if you're one of the millions of people out there who uses Dropbox, you no longer have to decide whether you should store your Office files in Dropbox or OneDrive — you can keep everything in Dropbox and Office will see it, whether you're on mobile or on the web.

It is a catch-all term for a combination of pressure sensitivity and haptic feedback that you will find built into the Apple Watch and the trackpad of the newly redesigned MacBook. Force Touch is Apple’s hallmark of newness for 2015, but it also finds a home in one of the Cupertino company’s less adventurous machines, the 13-inch MacBook Pro. Though it was a mere footnote to Apple’s big event last month, the MacBook Pro will actually play a pioneering role for its maker. It’s going to serve as the device on which many people experience Force Touch for the first time, and it signifies Apple’s intention to make this a standard feature across all of its laptops. Unlike the more glamorous Watch and MacBook, the new MacBook Pro is practical and designed for everyone. Its price isn’t weighed down by a novelty premium, its versatility and power aren’t compromised, and its raison d'être isn’t in question. This is Apple’s most powerful mobile computer, so if mobile computing is a thing you do, this is the laptop for you. It really is that simple.   Left: 2013 MacBook Air with original glass trackpad. Right: 2015 Retina MacBook Pro with new Force Touch trackpad. The new MacBook Pro’s design is, to borrow a famous Jony Ive adverb, unapologetically unchanged. Convinced in the superiority of its display, keyboard, and chassis, Apple has kept them all the same as in years past. All the upgrades have taken place within. Everything inside the machine is now faster: the processor, the memory, and the SSD have all been given a speed boost. This dual approach of moving to new technology while sticking to a familiar aesthetic is best exemplified by the Force Touch trackpad. The size and shape of Apple’s new trackpad on the Pro are the same as the classic glass pad that’s been around for years now. Touch it and you won’t notice anything different about its smooth surface. Press into it and you’ll hear and feel a familiar click. It’s the same reliable, satisfying user experience that Windows laptops have been so chronically unable to match. Only the click isn’t real. Force Touch uses a haptic feedback system, which vibrates the pad’s surface in a way that simulates the sensation of pressing a button in. In reality, the trackpad is fixed in place and barely moves at all. The sound of the click is simulated just like the sense of motion under my finger, but both feel real. As far as all my senses are concerned, I am clicking exactly as before. Apple has taken one of the last remaining mechanical parts in its laptops and replaced it with a more high-tech version that — successfully — recreates the familiar tactile response. I came to this review dreading the idea of Apple tinkering with a thing that really didn’t need changing. The original glass trackpad is one of the MacBook’s clearest advantages, and it seemed to me that Apple was tackling a problem that didn’t need a solution. But I’m gratified to find that little has been lost in the transition to an electronic alternative, and there’s plenty to be gained from it — in the future, if not immediately. For example, the new design means a click at the very top of the trackpad feels the same as at the bottom. The old hinge made clicking easier in the lower half of the touchpad. Another important advantage for Apple’s engineers, claims the company, is that the static pad is less likely to break down over time and takes up a tiny bit less space than its predecessor. While that doesn’t make a difference for me today, Apple’s big design revolutions are built upon small evolutions of precisely this magnitude: shaving off a millimeter here, improving space efficiency there, and suddenly a new MacBook is born.   And yet, the MacBook Pro isn’t the future-facing MacBook. It’s the machine for now, for today, which signals that Apple considers Force Touch a technology that’s mature enough to be deployed widely and capitalized upon through software. That’s the thing that can make Force Touch special: what Apple and its vibrant ecosystem of software developers do with the new pad’s capabilities. So far, practical uses for the Force Touch trackpad’s pressure sensitivity are quite limited. I’ve made a valiant effort to try and use the functions Apple has integrated into OS X, but they’re honestly no more useful or intuitive than bashing out a quick right-click. I can press down once for a click, or push further to get a Force click, which produces a contextual action like a dictionary lookup or a preview of a web link or a document. Even with three distinct settings of ""firmness"" for the regular click, I am never truly sure if and when I’m adding enough pressure to turn it into a Force click. And what’s worse, most apps don’t yet support the feature, which means I’d be wasting my time developing the proper Force Touch habits if I spend most of my days inside unsupported apps.   The most immediate benefits of Force Touch on laptops are likely are to be felt when using drawing apps. Inklet was first out of the gate in announcing support for the new trackpad, turning it into a Wacom-like input field for styluses. With force sensitivity, you’re now able to control the thickness of your digital brush’s tip by adjusting how much pressure you apply with the stylus. Apple has already enabled the same feature when signing documents in its Preview app — even if you just use your finger — and the latest version of OS X contains the APIs necessary for more software makers to get involved. Beyond practical and artistic applications, Force Touch also has great potential to benefit disabled users. The tactile feedback provided from Apple’s Taptic Engine can be used to help those with poor eyesight by augmenting information on the screen. The trackpad can give small sensory hints and help people navigate their way around the OS X interface. While very little of that potential has yet been tapped, it’s certainly available for both Apple and others to explore. With Force Touch being a prominent feature of the Apple Watch and new MacBook — two devices that are only just beginning to figure out their best uses and applications — there’s good reason to expect a wave of innovative applications for Apple’s new technology. As of today, Force Touch is a neat enhancement, but far from a singularly excellent feature that you should go out and buy a new computer for. There are plenty of good reasons to own a MacBook Pro, though, even if they are as familiar as the computer’s appearance. For starters, the Retina display on my 13-inch review unit is simply stunning. Coming from a 2013 MacBook Air, I notice major differences in color reproduction, viewing angles, contrast, and, of course, sharpness. The 2560 x 1600 resolution of the display embarrasses my incumbent laptop’s non-Retina screen. As someone who spends great stretches of time staring into text editors on screen, I really appreciate the crispness and precision of text rendering on this new MacBook Pro. One of the initial stumbling blocks for Apple’s Retina displays was the graphics chip’s inability to handle all of those pixels at once. Intel’s new Broadwell processor promises, as every new piece of silicon does, major improvements in performance, but there are still occasions where the MacBook Pro is simply overwhelmed by the amount of information it has to animate on the screen. This most commonly happens when switching in and out of the Mission Control multitasking overview with a bunch of apps open. I may be willing to forgive such infractions on my MacBook Air, which trades away a sliver of performance for better battery life and a thinner profile, but the Pro is supposed to be the no-compromise MacBook. The comparison to my present laptop is also salient when looking at the new Retina MacBook Pro’s general performance. It’s very fast, right from the start. It boots up in under 14 seconds, wakes from sleep in less time than it takes me to open its lid, and handles multiple apps with aplomb. It can play back the new 60fps 4K videos that YouTube has just rolled out (provided I use Safari and not Chrome). But I can say the exact same things about my Haswell-powered Air, only adjusting the boot time to a slightly slower 16 seconds. To feel the actual benefit of the greater power contained within the new Pro, you’ll have to take on more intensive tasks like video and image processing. Gaming is another obvious power-hungry application, but that’s the one thing I wouldn’t recommend buying a MacBook for. Even lightweight games like Sid Meier’s Starships and Valve’s Dota 2 are buggy and unattractive when played on OS X. The lack of a discrete graphics chip in the 13-inch model is another hint pointing committed gamers in the direction of Windows-based alternatives that will better suit their needs. MacBook Pro users will be more interested in getting creative with Apple’s new Photos app or their favorite audio or video editing application. It’s when these workloads grow large that the MacBook Pro distinguishes itself. A GeekBench score of 7,001 marks a nice bump over the 6,303 of the 2013 Retina model as well as the 6,057 of my MacBook Air from the same year. But in most of my daily activities, this extra power goes completely unnoticed. The fast SSD storage in the new Pro machine is also capable of ludicrous speeds — doubling the previous generation’s numbers and achieving a read speed in excess of 1GB per second — but I am again unable to come up with daily use scenarios that make that apparent. The difference is between fast and ultra fast when handling specific, heavy workloads. A good example is the update to OS X 10.10.3, which took significantly longer on the Air than it did on the 2015 Pro — but how many times are you transferring and processing that volume of data? Battery life isn’t a massive differentiator between the Air and Pro lines. The MacBook Air has the edge during our web browsing battery test, but it’s a slight one: the Air runs for 13 hours and 29 minutes whereas the 2015 MacBook Pro achieves 13 hours and 18 minutes. Mind you, that’s when using Safari for your browsing, and there’s a major drop-off when using Google’s Chrome browser, which chews through the Pro’s battery in 9 hours and 45 minutes. In daily use, I’m finding myself recharging both the Pro and the Air at roughly the same intervals. Pushing beyond 10 hours of use isn’t a problem with either laptop and I can confidently leave home in the morning without worrying about bringing a charger. I’d be happy to recommend the Retina MacBook Pro on the strength of its display alone. Sure, I’m late to the Retina party, but now that I’m here, I don’t want to ever leave. The new Force Touch trackpad has the potential to be equally transformative, once compelling uses for its pressure sensitivity and haptic feedback are developed. As of right now, though, it’s just a really good trackpad, probably the best there is. It doesn’t feel like an obvious upgrade when moving to it from the MacBook Air, but I do sense a downgrade when going in the opposite direction and having to tap instead of click at the top of the pad. Apple has deliberately camouflaged its new Force Touch trackpad in the garb of its familiar hardware. It’s even simulating the click in an effort to keep the same trusty feel of the pad that MacBook users know and love. While the company’s confident about the technology, it clearly recognizes that Force Touch applications are yet to come and it’s being honest with its customers by releasing a new MacBook Pro that looks identical to the old one. There really is no reason to consider this new Pro model if you have one of its recent forebears. It’s undergone the annual honing and improvement of specs, but in its essence, it is the same old MacBook Pro. That might be a downside for any other machine, but in the case of the MacBook Pro, it just means that Apple continues to have one of the absolute best laptops in the world.",0.5376508642194489,0.46234913578055115,0.1721349893991404,2110,4.8175355450236967,898,6.4576837416481068,0,16,"Apple, Tech, Review",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Astronomers funded by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory today announced their study, reporting that Voyager 1 measured drastic changes in radiation levels — an indication that the spacecraft has left the wind of the Sun's energetic particles behind, traveling into unknown space. In December, scientists observed that Voyager had entered the penultimate stretch of its journey to interstellar space: an area called the ""magnetic highway."" At the time, NASA predicted that Voyager was anywhere from ""a few months to a couple of years away"" from leaving the solar system. Voyagers 1 and 2, launched in 1977 under the Carter administration, were sent to fly to Jupiter, Saturn, and, assuming they could survive long enough, to other planets in the solar system. Voyager 2 successfully reached Neptune in 1989, while Voyager 1 was launched by Saturn's gravity into a new trajectory that has taken it to the edge of our cosmic backyard. While there's no telling when Voyager 1 and 2 will go quiet, they'll still bear marks of human civilization; each spacecraft carries gold-plated disks with representations of photos, music, and messages from Earth. ""This is a present from a small distant world, a token of our sounds, our science, our images, our music, our thoughts, and our feelings,"" said President Jimmy Carter following the Voyager launch. ""We hope someday, having solved the problems we face, to join a community of galactic civilizations."" The astronomers note that scientists are still debating whether Voyager 1 has reached interstellar space, but in any event, the spacecraft has reportedly entered an unknown region. ""It's outside the normal heliosphere,"" says New Mexico State University astronomer W.R. Webber. ""We're in a new region. And everything we're measuring is different and exciting."" Update: The astronomers involved in today's announcement were right about one thing: the results are under debate. The official Voyager team at NASA has just disputed the findings, saying that ""it is the consensus of the Voyager science team that Voyager 1 has not yet left the solar system or reached interstellar space.""

Now, nearly a full 12 months later, Bezos' team has recovered a number of F-1 engine parts and brought them out of the ocean — his blog goes into full detail, with a variety of great photos and a quick video showing the underwater recovery. Bezos says that his team recovered enough ""major components"" to put together displays of two flown F-1 engines. ""We want the hardware to tell its true story, including its 5,000 mile per hour re-entry and subsequent impact with the ocean surface,"" Bezos writes. Unfortunately, many of the serial numbers from the recovered parts are missing, which will make determining which exactly Apollo mission the parts are from quite a bit more difficult. While Bezos didn't indicate whether he still hopes to display the rockets in the Smithsonian and the Seattle Museum of Flight, it definitely appears that this engines will be on public display somewhere, once some restoration to prevent further corrosion is complete. Bezos also gave some details on the technology behind the recovery — the team used remotely operated vehicles that dived 14,000 feet below sea level.

The Pentagon said that it was releasing the final three Uighur detainees to Slovakia, which has agreed to take them in. ""This transfer and resettlement constitutes a significant milestone in our effort to close the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay,"" Rear Admiral John Kirby, the Pentagon's press secretary, says in a statement.  ""A significant milestone in our effort to close the detention facility."" Though a ""significant milestone,"" the transfer comes after much delay. According to The New York Times, the US military determined as early as 2003 that these three detainees should be released. Later, a 2008 court order mandated the release of all Uighur detainees still at Guantanamo — of which there were 17 at the time — but the process has been piecemeal due to troubles with finding countries to take them. In total, the Times reports that 22 Uighurs have been detained in Guantanamo, most of them captured in Afghanistan in the early 2000s when the military believed them to be associated with Al Qaeda or the Taliban. In reality, many had simply fled from China, where they've been persecuted as an ethnic minority. In 2004, the Times reported that the Uighur detainees did not want to be returned from Guantanamo to China, fearing that they would be considered terrorists and tortured or killed. Pressure from the Chinese government has reportedly kept many countries from offering to take the Uighur detainees in, making the release process a slow one. The Times reports that six were transferred out by the Bush administration, while 12 were released between 2009 and 2010. But releasing the remaining five became a problem when they refused to go to certain countries. Two finally went last year to El Salvador, while these last three were said to have been waiting for a country they preferred more — despite extending their stay in detention.

Additionally, we have been unaware of this alleged NSA program targeting our products."" The program in question is called DROPOUTJEEP, described in a leaked 2008 slide as a tool capable of turning on and capturing data from iOS microphones and cameras and remotely pulling files, contact lists, text messages, location data, and more. While security researcher Jacob Appelbaum suggested that the program could only work as perfectly as the NSA claimed with help from Apple, the leaked documents describe the FBI, NSA, and CIA covertly intercepting a variety of electronic devices to install malware, not necessarily with the company's knowledge. In this case, the slide says the first version of DROPOUTJEEP would be installed via close physical access, while future versions could be installed remotely. Previous leaks, especially for the internet data collection program known as PRISM, have apparently shown that Apple and other companies allowed the NSA to pull data from their servers, although all companies have denied these claims. But installing malware on an iPhone can be done by non-NSA hackers as well, and the DROPOUTJEEP exploit was leaked alongside other modules that could supposedly let agents control any GSM phone, regardless of manufacturer.  The real question is where the program has gone since this document — which was composed in the very early days of the iPhone and smartphones in general — and whether Apple and other companies can effect much meaningful change.

He’s used social media and inexpensive distribution to get his message out. His most recent film, Unmanned: America’s Drone Wars, investigates US drone policy, including testimony from people on the ground. Last October on Capitol Hill, Greenwald testified with the Rafiq Rehman family, the first Pakistani drone strike survivors to appear before Congress. In the following conversation, edited for length and clarity, he discusses why he thinks drone strikes are counterproductive, how they got to be such a major part of US policy, and why we have such a hard time talking about them.  What drew you to this topic in the first place? Did your perspective change as you worked on the documentary? I was drawn to it because I’ve done a series of films and investigations around the war issues. I did the first film around the Iraq war and the reasons we were given for it; I did another film called Iraq for Sale about war profiteering; I went to Afghanistan and did a film challenging the military policy there. I see the idea of the bipartisan militarization of policy — the bipartisan belief that we will be safer by invading or occupying or droning — as one that is highly questionable. The drones were another example to me of a belief that there is a silver bullet. Is it counterinsurgency; is it counterterrorism — whatever is the philosophy of the moment or, in this case, the tool of the moment. It’s consistent with what I’ve been interested in, what I’ve done a series of films on. When I did the research, it didn’t seem possible that what we were hearing was accurate. That here was this new tool, and it was only getting very dangerous people. I don’t believe in Santa Claus, I don’t believe in the Tooth Fairy, and this seemed really, really questionable. But I wasn’t sure, and I didn’t know how much damage was being done. I thought maybe, in the larger scheme of things, there is some rationale for it. The people advocating for this are not stupid people. ""I don’t believe in Santa Claus, I don’t believe in the Tooth Fairy, and this seemed really, really questionable."" But when I interviewed people — “game-changer” is an understatement. It was an extraordinary experience to talk to person after person who clearly is innocent, who clearly has had family members killed who shouldn’t have been killed. Then to speak to experts in Pakistan: most notably Imran Khan saying to me, “Yes, there were 100, maybe 200 fanatics in the tribal area, and now you have 80,000 people who hate you. How will that make you more secure?” I started more with questions, and then it moved to a stronger and stronger opposition. The people made it clear to me that the policy was not one that could be justified, on any level. Ultimately, none of the arguments held up for me, over the course of a little over a year of working on the film.  What are the arguments in favor of using drones this way? The first argument was that they’d target only high-value targets. They’re not doing that. We’re seeing thousand and thousands of people in different countries who are not high-value targets. How do we know? Because whenever there is a high-value target, they announce that. But those numbers are 2 percent, 3 percent. So you can’t say this is a policy of going after high-value targets when it’s such an incidental percentage of what we’re doing. Why is it expanding like that? Is it the philosophy, is it the CIA, is it bureaucrats taking over? We’re never going to know that, but it’s clearly gotten beyond what was initially suggested. That’s one argument. The second argument is of an imminent threat: somebody’s going to do something now and the only way to stop him — this is partly a legal argument — is with a drone. Well, I don’t believe even the government or the CIA or the White House has articulated a single case where someone represented an imminent threat, say a person holding someone hostage or a person who has a gun and is about to shoot someone. I’ve never seen that argued; based on the information that we’re getting, it seems hard to believe we’d have that kind of situation. ""The information being given to the technically accurate drones is,  over and over and over again, inaccurate information."" Another argument is that these drones are incredibly accurate. Technically, they are. What’s the problem? The problem is the information being given to the technically accurate drones is,  over and over and over again, inaccurate information. Whether it’s somebody settling a grudge because so much money is being offered for targets; whether it’s mistaken names; whether it’s military interventions trying to clean up battles that they’re having — there’s a variety of possibilities. The main one that I heard repeatedly in Pakistan is the idea that in a very, very poor area, money is being used. We saw this policy in Guantanamo: the CIA spent a lot of money around Afghanistan, and you had a lot of people wind up in Guantanamo and in Iraq who, by the government’s own admission, were innocent. That’s a fundamental problem with the policy. The other argument is that this is much better than sending in troops. Well, that’s not the question. Nobody in their right mind is talking about sending troops to invade Pakistan, yet we have drone strikes ongoing there. That argument sounds good, but it’s not an accurate description of the alternatives.  We’ve been using drone strikes for more than a decade, but it seems as though a sustained, serious conversation about the policy hasn’t really taken place. Do you think it will? I think it’s a hard conversation for people to have. And they don’t want to have it for a couple of reasons. One is it’s a conversation that challenges an essential, almost religious belief that military solutions are available for the most difficult, complex problems. The drone situation suggests that’s not true. I definitely think there was a spike in discussion around the John Brennan CIA confirmation. What we were frankly trying to do was to ignite another conversation. Hopefully we’ve been able to do a little bit of that. You never know — it’s only when you look backwards can you say, ""Yeah, I think we were able to help there.” ""The Iraq and Afghanistan wars have not made us safer."" I’m optimistic and I’m pessimistic. I’m pessimistic because the entrenched interests, both philosophical and financial, that are supportive of military solutions are extraordinary in their size and power. That makes me pessimistic. I’m optimistic because of a combination for people really knowing that with all the death and with the extraordinary, horrific human toll and with all the money spent, the Iraq and Afghanistan wars have not made us safer. So we have that kind of foundation to build from, which we haven’t really had before. That gives me hope. These things don’t happen overnight, but sometimes with a film if you can get people feeling something, you can get them thinking something, and then you can get them taking action.

""There is not a substantial risk that their electronic devices will be subject to a search or seizure without reasonable suspicion,"" he noted. And even if the lawsuit had moved forward, the judge added that the government doesn't need reasonable suspicion to confiscate or search devices like laptops or cellphones. His laptop was confiscated and held for nearly two weeks The lawsuit in question was initially filed in 2010 by Pascal Abidor, a student pursuing a graduate degree in Islamic studies. Abidor was removed from a train while traveling from Canada back to the US, detained for several hours, and saw his laptop confiscated and held for nearly two weeks. He was joined as a plaintiff by the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers and the National Press Photographers Association, who stated that traveling with confidential information on electronic devices was necessary for their work, and represented by the ACLU. ""Suspicionless searches of devices containing vast amounts of personal information cannot meet the standard set by the Fourth Amendment, which prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures,"" reads a statement from ACLU attorney Catherine Crump.

After a week of drama surrounding hacking, threats, and Presidential disses, Sony has decided to give The Interview a limited theatrical release on December 25th. ""We have never given up on releasing The Interview, and we're excited our movie will be in a number of theaters on Christmas Day,"" Michael Lynton, CEO of Sony Entertainment, says in a statement. ""At the same time, we are continuing our efforts to secure more platforms and more theaters so that this movie reaches the largest possible audience."" The people have spoken! Freedom has prevailed! Sony didn't give up! The Interview will be shown at theaters willing to play it on Xmas day!  Two theaters immediately confirmed that they would be screening the film: Alamo Drafthouse and the Plaza Atlanta. It sounds as though the theatrical release will be fairly small, with the Plaza saying that it would be among ""the few theaters in the nation to open the film."" The New York Times reports that Sony is aiming for 200 to 300 smaller theaters.  Sony appears to be done with getting blackmailed by hackers The Plaza says that it will be screening The Interview from Christmas through New Year's Day. However, it remains unclear exactly how wide this release will be. Sony previously took down just about all online advertising for The Interview, but alongside these reports, its Twitter page was relaunched, suggesting that marketing is starting up again. The Alamo Drafthouse's Dallas location is now listing tickets for sale. The theater chain says that it will be playing The Interview at ""multiple"" of its nationwide locations, but it has not determined which specific ones just yet. The Wrap also reports that Sony will release The Interview on-demand on Christmas, though Sony makes no note of this in its statement. However, Sony does say that it is trying to ""secure more platforms"" to release the film, which suggests that it is actively investigating on-demand networks that it can use. The Wrap reports that Sony was in talks with Dish to have it distribute the film, but those talks are said to have fallen apart over the weekend. There's no suggestion as to what network Sony will use or is even looking into, but there are no shortage of options available. This is a big change of pace from Sony, which has come across more-or-less clueless about what to do with the The Interview until now. It initially cancelled the film's release last week, following threats by hackers to attack its screenings. Since then, Sony hasn't said much, aside from trying to shift the blame for its cancellation onto the theaters that wouldn't show it. A number of small theaters, like the Alamo Drafthouse, have always been quite vocal about their intention to show the film, however, and it sounds like Sony has finally listened. ""We are proud to ... have stood up to those who attempted to suppress free speech."" While we hope this is only the first step of the film's release,"" Lynton says, ""we are proud to make it available to the public and to have stood up to those who attempted to suppress free speech."" The film, which stars Seth Rogen and James Franco, is about an assassination attempt on North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. It also graphically depicts his death. The FBI has identified North Korea as being behind the cyberattack on Sony, presumably initiating it because of The Interview's premise. ""This is the best Christmas gift anyone could give us,"" Alamo Drafthouse CEO Tim League says in a statement, ""We, both distributors and exhibitors, have collectively stood firm to our principles and for the right to freedom of expression. Two days till Christmas, and I am proud to be an American."" Playing The Interview on Christmas — and, especially, releasing it on-demand — will be a big win for Sony as far as saving face goes. The downside for the studio is that the group who hacked it said that they would release more stolen Sony data if the film was screened, and it's possible that Sony will now have to deal with the repercussions of that. That may ultimately be a good thing, though. Sony can't allow this group to continue blackmailing it indefinitely, and releasing The Interview now means that it's done with folding to hacker threats. It's also possible that Sony is now more certain of the safety of The Interview screenings. Though Homeland Security almost immediately suggested that it was an empty threat, the government is now publicly stating that North Korea was behind the hack that set these events off. With President Obama saying that canceling the film was the wrong choice, Sony may well feel more confident in making the decision to screen it. Sony was attacked by hackers in late November, shortly after which, the hackers began releasing stolen Sony documents online. Those releases have created quite a headache for Sony. They've included highly embarrassing emails, business plans, and sensitive information on its employees, such as their social security numbers. Last week, the hackers threatened to attack movie theaters playing The Interview, leading to Sony's temporary cancellation of the film. On Friday, the FBI formally identified North Korea as the culprit, though the country has denied involvement. Now the biggest remaining question is: is The Interview any good? The internet says ""yes,"" but early reviews say ""no."" In reality, it probably doesn't matter. As Seth Rogen puts it: ""The people have spoken!"" James Franco had this to say: VICTORY!!!!!!!

But in most cases, the priority these cameras place on photography is easy to see from their grips and button layouts. A new camera from Canon goes the other way — it's more or less a camcorder, but one that should please photographers as well. The XC10 shares some DNA with Canon's high-end Cinema EOS line, in particular the C100. It has a 1-inch sensor with a max ISO sensitivity of 20,000, and Canon says it will provide 12 stops of dynamic range when capturing 305Mbps 4K video or 12-megapixel still photos. The fixed lens is a 24-240mm-equivalent f/2.8-5.6 zoom, and the body is small at just 4.9 x 4 x 4.8 inches — though it gets bigger when attaching the lens hood and clip-on loupe-style viewfinder. There's a microphone socket, headphone jack, HDMI 1.4 port, DC power, a built-in neutral density filter, and both USB and Wi-Fi connectivity.   What all of this means is that the XC10 should be a seriously versatile camera that draws on Canon's abilities in both photo and video. It could be particularly well suited to journalists and others in the media who need to capture high-quality movies and still images in the field without carrying a ton of gear. While 1-inch sensors aren't as capable as what you'd find in a DSLR, cameras like Sony's RX100 line have proven that they can produce great results. The XC10 will be a niche product for consumers That said, at $2,499 the XC10 will be a niche product among consumers. Sony's RX10 and Panasonic's FZ1000 pair more capable lenses with the same size sensor and reasonable amateur-level video capability for less than half the price, for example, and Panasonic's Lumix GH4 is a strong 4K-capable contender with a larger Micro Four Thirds sensor and a wide selection of compatible lenses. But for a certain kind of user, the XC10 could be a uniquely appealing camera. It's a hybrid device that puts pro-level video at the forefront of its design, while offering strong photo functionality along the way. It'll be out in June.

The highlight is a new panel in Premiere that's meant to make color correcting videos as easy as Lightroom makes color correcting photos. In fact, the new panel, called Lumetri Color, looks and works pretty much exactly like the correction tools in Lightroom. You can drag sliders left and right to save highlights and shadows, tint and saturate colors, sharpen and brighten your image, and so on. Curves and basic grading tools are there, too.  Lightroom-style color correction is a huge improvement Lumetri Color won't replace dedicated coloring tools, nor will it necessarily even replace add-ons like Magic Bullet Looks. But from the demo Adobe showed The Verge over a screencast, it appears to be a dramatic improvement over the app's existing color tools, which aren't very accessible to new users. Of course, the tools will have to work well in practice for this to be the dramatic improvement that it appears to be, but it's a sign of Adobe streamlining its sometimes disparate collection of apps around a common — and simple — way of working. Adobe says that it's heard plenty of requests over the years to have color correction in Premiere work just like Lightroom; this is apparently much easier said than done, but it's finally just about done.  Project Candy screenshots. The color panel actually comes with one other particularly cool trick. Adobe is working on a new iPhone app called Project Candy that takes a photo, analyzes its color makeup, and then applies that to a photo or video like a filter. The idea is that you can take a photo of a scene that has the tone you like and then have Adobe automatically figure out how to give another image or video the same vibe. In the demo Adobe showed, it seemed to work about as well as any other filter — which is to say, the effect was generally too strong until it was toned down. Nonetheless, the combined effect should make editing how a video looks in Premiere Pro much easier for new and inexperienced users than before. Candy's filters will also work in After Effects and the mobile app Premiere Clip. The other particularly interesting feature being added to Premiere Pro may actually make editors cringe. It's called Time Tuner, and Adobe says that it can be used to increase or decrease the length of a project by 10 percent, supposedly without making a noticeable difference. The goal is to automate what some TV networks have been doing with reruns, like Seinfeld, speeding the show up so that more commercials can be squeezed in. It's not something that'll make viewers very happy, but it's interesting to see Adobe building this in for the networks. Another tool lets you animate cartoons using a webcam Adobe is also announcing an upcoming preview release of Character Animator today. Character Animator is a new desktop app, first demoed last year under the name Animal, that's supposed to make it easy to animate cartoon characters. The app can analyze basic character art pulled in from other apps and then animate it based on what the app sees an actor doing over a webcam, turning side to side as the actor does, speaking when the actor speaks, and so on. It's not clear how powerful the tool will be for existing animators, but Adobe is pitching it as an efficient option.  Character Animator in use. That's not everything that Adobe is announcing today — it also has updates for After Effects, Audition, SpeedGrade, and more — but those are some of the biggest highlights. Unfortunately, you're going to have to wait to use them. Adobe says that the updates being announced today likely won't be available until late spring or early summer.

The revamped lineup offers up to 128GB of additional storage, with the iPhone 6 and iPad mini cases doubling the smartphones' battery life. The iPhone 6 Plus option, however, only adds an additional 50 percent juice. up to 128GB extra storage and 100 percent extra battery Mophie first unveiled its Space Pack range for the iPhone 5 and 5S last year, and the new cases offer the same package. The bulky cases fit around your smartphone, slotting into its Lightning port and providing a micro-USB slot on the bottom edge for power and storage. The mute, volume, and power switches remain accessible through overlaid buttons, and the case itself also provides extra protection against bumps and scrapes. When turned on, the Space Pack feeds the smartphone power until it runs out and the phone's internal battery takes over. However, while Mophie's battery-only Juice Pack range has been well received, reviews of the Space Pack have been a little more mixed. Last year, The Guardian pointed out that while Mophie's extra storage was good in theory, in practice, managing files is not a smooth process — mostly due to Apple's restrictions on how third parties can access iOS storage. So, for example, you can use Mophie's app to browse music on both your iPhone and your Space Pack, but you can't use Apple's Music app to access music on your Space Pack. Mophie's extra storage is good in theory, but tricky to navigate in practice Mophie is updating its Space app to make this sort of file management easier (including a new feature that lets users access items using Macs and PCs on the same Wi-Fi network as the phone). However, those with content locked inside apps like Spotify and VSCO Cam won't be able to make much use of the extra local storage. the spacestation offers extra battery and storage in a static unit There are other options though.

The product itself is actually made up of three components: the knob, which mechanically controls the temperature on the burner with a battery-powered motor; a thermometer, which clips into your pots and pans to measure the temperature, sending data back wirelessly to the knob; and a connected iOS and Android app, which allows you to remotely control the temperature or choose from hundreds of preset recipes.  The Meld app and smart knob. (Meld) Meld's creators say the device can be used for a whole range of cooking methods, including poaching, frying, simmering, slow cooking, and candy making. The precise temperature control also means it's suitable for sous vide — a method which involves sealing meat in a plastic bag and placing it in a water bath for long periods of time. Sous vide has been a target for smart cooking companies for a while now, with products like the $179 Anova allowing amateur chefs to set and forget their submersed steaks. However, the Meld is not only cheaper than other options on the market (Kickstarter early birds snagged it for $99, but its normal retail price is $149), but it's also more flexible, allowing users to automate a greater number of recipes.

Populations are dwindling, poaching is on the rise, and the illegal ivory trade has shown no signs of slowing down. The lucrative underground business has turned parts of Africa into a grim, blood-soaked landscape, but many see hope in the form of a familiar forensic tool: DNA testing. This week, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) passed a new resolution that requires all 178 member countries to submit seized ivory for DNA testing, as part of a renewed effort to crack down on elephant poachers and the criminal networks behind them. Tracking traffickers with tusks Experts say such testing can accurately identify the region where a given elephant was killed, thereby providing investigators with a detailed map of where poaching is most prevalent. When combined with existing information on known criminal networks, these data could help law enforcement track down responsible organizations, while pressuring implicated countries to take greater action within their borders. The measure, passed at the CITES' annual conference in Bangkok on Wednesday, was immediately hailed as a ""major success"" by the Kenyan delegation that helped draft it, though its long-term impact ultimately depends on international cooperation and enforcement — two components that have thus far proven elusive. For conservationists, the resolution comes at a critical time. Elephant poaching has skyrocketed in recent years, reaching levels not seen since CITES ratified an international ivory trade ban in 1989. Estimates from the UN Environmental Programme shows that global ivory trade has doubled since 2007, and tripled since 1998. In 2011, an estimated 17,000 elephants were illegally killed, and although official estimates have yet to be tabulated, experts say 2012 was likely even worse. Africa's forest elephants have seen an especially steep decline, with two-thirds of their population having been killed off within the past decade, according to a recent study. Chinese demand has decimated elephant populations Much of this decline has been fueled by increased demand from China, where deep cultural tradition and a burgeoning middle class have combined to raise prices of African ivory, making the trade more alluring to traffickers, and more susceptible to government corruption. Past efforts to curb the ivory trade have also been met with objections from some African nations, forcing CITES to implement a handful of ""one-off"" exceptions that some saw as an undermining threat to its 1989 ban. But perhaps most problematic are the inherently covert parameters under which the ivory trade unfolds. In an effort to evade authorities, shipments are often routed through several ports, making their paths incredibly difficult to trace, and blame difficult to assign. That's where the DNA comes in.  Dr. Samuel Wasser, a professor of biology at the University of Washington, is the pioneer behind the genetic techniques that CITES adopted this week. His methods were first published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in 2007, but his work dates back to 2004, when his lab began creating a DNA map compiled from dung samples of African elephants. Today, Wasser and his team continue to refine and expand upon the gene frequency map that guides their work, and have already produced impressive results. According to Wasser, his technique can pinpoint a given ivory seizure to its place of origin within a radius of 265 kilometers (165 miles), based on genetic patterns that correlate to specific regions. ""the only way to keep the animals from being killed in the first place."" Wasser, who helped draft the CITES resolution alongside the Kenyan delegation, acknowledges that the approach has some shortcomings; his lab still needs to expand its genetic database, and the method can only be applied to large samples of ivory rather than single tusks (CITES' mandate applies to seizures of at least 500 kilograms). But he maintains that the technique could go a long way toward not only stamping out current crime organizations, but preventing future poaching as well. ""Attacking the trade at its source is the most direct and least expensive way to control this transnational organized crime by choking the networks that supply this trade,"" Wasser said in an email to The Verge. ""It is also the only way to keep the animals from being killed in the first place.""  The idea, Wasser explains, is to highlight areas where poaching is particularly dense, while easing diplomatic relations among so-called ""transit"" countries unwittingly implicated in ivory trafficking. A CITES report published last year, for instance, recommended sanctions against transit countries that conducted ivory seizures at their ports, even if the illicit shipments were destined for another location. By establishing a clear source country, Wasser's method would allow policymakers to sharpen their focus on particularly problematic regions, rather than intermediaries. CITES' rules have already drawn praise from leading conservationist groups. Crawford Allan, an illegal wildlife trade expert at the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), echoed Wasser's optimism, saying he expects the CITES mandate to ""bring law enforcement agencies across the globe to work together"" toward eradicating criminal networks and stemming the ""devastating surge"" in elephant poaching. ""With so many large ivory seizures taking place, it’s surprising to think that the ivory itself holds within its DNA the answer to the crime problem,"" Allan said. Long-term impact remains dependent upon local law enforcement The only question is whether all 178 CITES countries — including China — will actually adhere to this new resolution. Here, Wasser strikes a more cautious tone. The UN Office of Drugs and Crime will soon publish oversight measures that would punish any countries found to be in violation of CITES' mandate, though Wasser acknowledges that the effectiveness of his method will ultimately hinge upon the vigilance of local law enforcement. And as ivory prices continue to climb, he says global leaders must focus their efforts on ""decreasing demand over the long term"" — something that likely won't be achieved with a single policy. Still, the science underpinning CITES' resolution holds promise not just for fragile elephant populations, but for other threatened species, as well. Samrat Mondol, an Indian post-doctorate student at Wasser's lab, has already begun applying similar methods to tigers and leopards. Early results, the professor says, are encouraging.",0.8506034395900154,0.1493965604099846,0.8547323151087953,1047,5.4250238777459412,570,6.6263157894736846,0,0,"Policy & Law, Science, Politics, Report",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Unlike the traditional MRI method, which generates an electromagnetic field and pulses of radio waves to map the body, Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting (MRF) works by generating the same field across multiple frequencies simultaneously and using software algorithms to decode the results. Mark Griswold, a radiology professor at Case Western Reserve School of Medicine, compared the difference between the techniques to the difference between two choirs. While MRIs ""sing"" a single tone, MRFs generate a rich harmony that can distinguish between multiple tissue properties. Researchers believe they could develop a ""songbook"" of diseases that will allow doctors to identify diseases based on their tone. ""If colon cancer is ‘Happy Birthday’ and we don’t hear ‘Happy Birthday,’ the patient doesn’t have colon cancer,"" says Griswold.  MRF could prove an invaluable tool in the early detection of diseases. The technique is also a potential time-saver. Scientists scanned a patient's brain with MRF and were able to tell the difference between gray and white matter in around 12 seconds, and believe the same results could be obtained faster in the future. In contrast, a traditional MRI can take as long as 90 minutes. There's still a lot of work to be done, specifically in identifying and mapping how different types of diseased tissue respond to the scans.

The New York TimesJelani Cobb explores the ways in which drones democratize aviation, and the nervous hand-wringing that comes with it. This is what happens when you launch a drone in Manhattan: People, most of them men, stop in their tracks to ask you about it. They rush outside in their socks to get a closer look at the machine slicing through the sky. A woman may stop to watch you fiddle with your controller, note your frustration at the technical difficulties and walk away — but not before a nearby man makes the obvious joke about failure to launch. NPR Theoretical physicist Marcelo Gleiser explores the reality of proposed scenarios when it comes to the existence of extra-terrestrial life. At face value, the transition from nonlife to life seems incredibly complex. But even if it's fairly easy, what happens next is crucial: To go from simple life, consisting of unicellular organisms, to complex life requires a series of extremely unlikely events. And the unlikeliness is not only related to tough biological mutations and metabolic pathways that have to be cleared up, but to the marriage of life to the planet as a whole. We can't understand the history of life in a planet without understanding the history of the planet; the two go hand in hand. This means that for life to emerge in a planet is different from for life to evolve in that planet in a path toward increasing complexity. Bloomberg Business Drake Bennett dives into the questionable methods of interrogation law enforcement and government officials sometimes use to get the answers they want. In intelligence, as in the most mundane office setting, some of the most valuable information still comes from face-to-face conversations across a table. In police work, a successful interrogation can be the difference between a closed case and a cold one. Yet officers today are taught techniques that have never been tested in a scientific setting. For the most part, interrogators rely on nothing more than intuition, experience, and a grab bag of passed-down methods. The Atlantic Shirley Li examines the cultural meaning of the number 13, and why it still affects elevator construction and real estate today. Around this time a year ago, I moved into an apartment on the 13th floor of a building that dared to label it as the 13th floor. The number didn't occur to me until after I moved in—I was mostly worried about having found the apartment on Craigslist—but even then, nothing eventful ever happened there. Sure the wi-fi cut out every now and then, but the floor wasn't haunted. My neighbors weren't disruptive. Jason Voorhees never showed up. I ended up not caring too much about living on the 13th floor.

Edward Snowden’s NSA leaks turned up the heat on a cauldron of privacy concerns that’s sure to boil over in the next year. Drones expanded from killing machines to potential package-delivery robots. The US government shut itself down and revealed a disheartening lack of technical competence with the Healthcare.gov launch debacle. Microsoft started down a path of completely reinventing itself by looking for a new CEO and trying to buy Nokia. From outlandish promises to dissembling politicians, the Hyperloop dreams were almost as big as the spying nightmares. It’s all a lot to remember, so we’ve put together our take on the biggest stories of the year.  What did 2013 mean and what will the next year bring? Read on for our take. The leaks began in June. Edward Snowden, an NSA contractor, had collected a vast store of secret internal documents and began sharing them with journalist Glenn Greenwald, The Washington Post, and others. The revelations were shocking: the scope and depth of the NSA’s collection of private data stopped looking like a conspiracy theory and became a cold, hard reality we all had to face. The leaks showed that the NSA has collected troves of phone records, spied on US citizens, and tapped the phones of foreign leaders.  Over the last half of 2013, the relentless cadence of releases overwhelmed the government’s attempts to justify the NSA programs. Snowden himself, who ultimately landed in Russia, declared that he “already won,” despite the likelihood that he will live his life in exile. Unfortunately, his claim to victory rings hollow — only now are committees and leaders beginning to take steps to bring about reform.  There's no going back. The Boston Marathon bombing will be a defining moment as we continue to wrangle with media, news, and tragedy unfolding live in the years to come. The shocking attacks killed three people in all, injured over 200 others, and lead to a week-long manhunt that shut down Boston and paralyzed the country. In addition to the brutality of the attacks, a new uncertainty aided by the free flow of information dominated the minutes, hours, and days following the explosion. An unending stream of hastily checked rumors, false leads, misinformation, and a well-meaning but misguided amateur forensic Reddit manhunt spiraled out of control. The race to be first tripped up traditional media and the hive mind alike on Twitter and across the internet; clearly the end is not written. Though the debates surrounding military drone strikes are far from over, 2013 saw a new issue rise: unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in US airspace.  This year, the FAA slowly moved ahead with plans to regulate domestic drone flight by 2015, approving the first commercial UAVs and accepting bids for a handful of test sites around the country. Companies, meanwhile, began work on drone-related services even before approval: Amazon made waves late in the year by announcing plans for half-hour, door-to-door delivery service by octocopter. Drones also became a common tool for public services, used by firefighters and police for surveillance, reconnaissance, and search-and-rescue operations. Of course, these developments weren’t without controversy: critics pushed for strong privacy protections to accompany the FAA’s other UAV rules, and several states passed laws regulating how police and private citizens could gather and use drone footage. The CEO and co-founder of two of the most exciting technology companies today — SpaceX and Tesla — Elon Musk sits atop The Verge 50 for a reason. Rarely a week went by in 2013 when the South African billionaire wasn’t in the news, having taken his white-hot electric vehicle-maker to its first-ever quarterly profit, docked a spacecraft with the International Space Station, and — in his plentiful spare time — designed an audacious high-speed transport system that could send commuters from LA to San Francisco in under half an hour. At just 42  years of age, it seems likely that Musk will be a newsmaker for many, many days to come (or sols, once he inevitably finds his way to Mars). For most billionaires, buying a newspaper works as a kind of a victory lap — but when Jeff Bezos bought the Washington Post this August, he was just getting started. Seven weeks later, while the ink was still dry on the Post deal, he announced the next generation of Kindle Fires, complete with Mayday’s innovative customer support system. As hardware, it’s impressive — but it’s just a bow wrapped around the company’s complete domination of the ebook market, and its strengthening hold on music, film, and TV distribution. But like any good keynote, there was One More Thing. After the halo had dimmed from Mayday, Bezos called in 60 Minutes to announce something absolutely no one expected — a plan to use drones to ferry packages seamlessly through the sky. With a little help from the FAA, you could be getting drone-powered soap deliveries as soon as 2015. The Obama administration earlier this year launched the largest consumer-facing app ever built by the government: Healthcare.gov, the health-insurance marketplace that was supposed to be a keystone of the administration’s landmark Affordable Care Act.  Unfortunately, that milestone foray into technology turned out to be a disaster. The website, as thousands of users now know, buckled under even modest traffic and produced absurd errors that often made getting insurance nearly impossible. While the debacle was a huge embarrassment for the administration, it also catalyzed a long-overdue debate about the convoluted and inefficient way the government buys technology. As a result, everyone from Silicon Valley to Washington, DC is now getting caught up on “federal IT procurement reform,” a process that is key to the success of government-led technology ventures in the future. Bitcoin, the virtual currency that mimics cash on the internet, has proven itself to be surprisingly resilient, as technology fads go. Despite increased regulation, repeated price crashes, massive heists, and competition from other virtual currencies, Bitcoin is now almost five years old — it’s showing no sign of going away, and has even spawned a meme-based me-too cryptocurrency.  The currency has faced a steady climb towards relevance, and 2013 was the year that people really started to take Bitcoin seriously. A single bitcoin’s price peaked at a high of more than $1,000, and it was the main subject of a first-of-its-kind Senate hearing on virtual currencies. Multiple international governments, including Norway, Germany, and Singapore, issued official opinions on Bitcoin use. And the illegal drug marketplace Silk Road, which had been a black mark on the currency’s reputation, was shut down by the FBI.  2013 saw the last big tech IPO that everybody had been waiting for: Twitter. Unlike Facebook, which faltered out of the gate, Twitter’s IPO was a home run by most measures. While a host of early employees and angel investors made a ton of new cash (some of which will pour back into the startup scene), the IPO established Twitter as a mainstream company. Next up? Profit, if Twitter plays its cards right. Those cards include more pictures, more ways to bring in new users (and potentially annoy current ones), and more rapid redesigns of its apps. Now that it’s a public company with real investors expecting real returns, the biggest changes for the service are yet to come. In her first full year as Yahoo’s CEO, Marissa Mayer kickstarted the company’s once-moribund mobile team and refreshed nearly the entire product line. Yahoo’s new Weather app won an Apple Design Award, and a similar look revived the company’s finance and news apps. Meanwhile, after years of pleas from loyal fans, Flickr got the attention — and redesign — it deserved. Yahoo’s accelerated pace of innovation was driven in large part by nonstop acquisitions. Since becoming CEO, Mayer has bought more than two dozen companies in areas including imaging, machine learning, video conferencing, and photography. But her biggest buy was Tumblr, the white hot blogging platform that Yahoo scooped up for $1.1 billion earlier this year. It’s unclear whether Mayer’s sharp maneuvers can make Yahoo as profitable as it once was — but with 400 million people now using the company’s products on mobile devices each month, its prospects are looking better and better. Although Microsoft launched a tweaked Windows 8.1 update and new Surface 2 models in 2013, this year was less about products and more about massive internal change. CEO Steve Ballmer revealed his giant reorganization plan to transform Microsoft into a devices and services company, before announcing, months later, that he won’t be around to see “One Microsoft” take shape. Ballmer will retire from Microsoft in 2014, with his successor expected to be named early next year. The next CEO will take over the ambitious plans, alongside an acquisition of Nokia’s device business. The surprising acquisition came just weeks after Ballmer’s retirement note, and sets the company on a path to be a hardware player in the smartphone and tablet market. With the new Xbox One console, Microsoft is also hoping to capture the living room. It’s another ambitious plan from a company in transition, but early figures show it’s selling well so far. 2013 has been a year of change for Microsoft, but 2014 is the year the company will need to prove its big bets can really start to pay off. Snapchat’s success wouldn’t be long-lived, pundits said. The app was too buggy, and its most important feature — its disappearing messages — could be cloned in a minute. But Snapchat kept growing, beating out Facebook’s ephemeral messaging app Poke, and eventually seeing over 400 million photos shared per day — which put it within spitting distance of Facebook. But as Snapchat’s engagement numbers grew, so did its aspirations and ego. As 2013 came to a close, the company reportedly turned down multibillion-dollar acquisition offers from Facebook and Google. In 2014, Snapchat will need to justify staying independent by finding ways to make money and add features — and do so without losing the advantage it seems to have over Facebook with younger users.  Remember when the music industry was doomed? It wasn’t so many years ago, but it feels like longer. It was before Beyoncé ambushed the web with one of the best albums of the year, owning the moment in a way most culture critics thought was impossible in the modern age. She was snatching it from Kanye, who’d been tussling with Daft Punk for control of the world’s headphones all summer. Jay-Z did his strange, transfixing, app-based two-step with Samsung and for months on end, it was all anyone wanted to talk about. And that’s to say nothing of the billion-dollar EDM company that splashed onto the Nasdaq in October. Music? Dead? What were we thinking? Original shows have been produced for the web since the 1990s, but they remained second-class citizens compared to network and cable series no matter how polished they were. In 2013 that all changed. Netflix lead the way as the Kevin Spacey vehicle House of Cards debuted to a flurry of positive reviews and viewing binges. Arrested Development and Orange Is the New Black proved it wasn’t a fluke, and the Emmys made it official when Netflix shows earned 14 nominations. Cards went on to win three awards, including best director for David Fincher. It echoes the legitimacy HBO gained when The Sopranos became the first original cable series to score an Emmy nomination, setting the stage for a revolution. With Amazon Studios recently releasing its first original shows and Microsoft working on a Halo series with Steven Spielberg, the question isn’t whether a streaming service can produce a “real” television show; it’s if the next Breaking Bad or Lost will even be available through traditional channels in the first place. In 2011, T-Mobile was very nearly bought up by AT&T and had no clear path to a next-generation LTE network. But in 2013, under new CEO John Legere, T-Mobile transformed itself from a struggling fourth-place carrier to an aggressive upstart aimed at turning the wireless industry in the US on its head. As part of its new “uncarrier” branding, T-Mobile got rid of the onerous cellphone contract, launched options for people to upgrade their devices more often, offered free data to all tablet customers, and deployed radically cheaper international data roaming plans. Oh, and it finally started selling the iPhone. The plan seems to be working: T-Mobile reported more new customer additions in 2013 than any other major carrier in the US. As a result, AT&T, Sprint, and Verizon have all followed suit with their own rapid-upgrade options, and AT&T recently launched plans that are less expensive for customers who have fulfilled their contracts. During a Q&A session at Google I / O this year, CEO Larry Page mused about an intriguing desire to “set aside a part of the world” where experimenters could perform tests and trials that don’t conform to pesky laws and regulations. But really, given all the outlandish experiments the company is running here at home, who needs a Google Island? This year brought Calico, a Google company tasked with curing illness, aging, and death. It brought Project Loon, a network of high-altitude balloons designed to connect the remaining two-thirds of the world’s population to the internet. And it brought robots. Google this year acquired eight robotics companies, including defense contractor Boston Dynamics, and put them under the leadership of former Android chief (and lifelong robot aficionado) Andy Rubin. Turns out there is a Google Island, after all. And we’re living on it. In March, Google buried a bombshell in its regular “spring cleaning” product shutdown blog post: Google Reader. The RSS client was still popular despite the fact that Reader was an all but abandoned product. Users decried the move and declared that RSS was still important for the web, but nevertheless Reader shut down as planned on July 1st. Luckily, companies from Aol to Feedly to Digg rushed to fill in the gap and by the end of the year there were several RSS reading and syncing options to choose from. RSS may have been supplanted by Twitter for many users, but it’s not quite dead yet. Banksy’s October ""residency"" in New York City was about so much more than his silhouette street art. Dubbed Better Out Than In, the month-long series saw unannounced Banksy installations all over the city, with a photo of each posted on Instagram setting off a Stateside frenzy where everyone was discussing street art in public. Art hunters raced around the five boroughs to catch a glimpse, local gawkers huddled nearby, and Mayor Bloomberg got riled up. Banksy strayed from his usual stencils with a tiny 9 / 11 memorial and cinder-block Sphinx, but it was all about art as an event that ratcheted ever higher as the installations disappeared or were defaced, painted over, and covered up in hours. Experts have been scrutinizing the red planet for decades, but 2013 offered up unprecedented and tantalizing details about what Mars is (and was) made of. After landing on the planet in August of 2012, NASA’s Curiosity rover spent this past year sending back reams of data for scientists to analyze, leading to new insights into the planet’s watery, potentially habitable past. And Curiosity will soon have more company, as this year also saw NASA launch the MAVEN probe to characterize Mars’ atmosphere. While scientists looked into the red planet’s past, others looked to its future — and kicked off bold ventures intended to get people to Mars within the next decade. Dennis Tito’s Inspiration Mars announced a plot to send two brave souls to the planet and back by 2018, while the Mars One project made headlines for its ambitious plan to create a self-sustaining human colony.  Windows has its Live Tiles, Google has its Cards, and now, with iOS 7 and OS X Mavericks, Apple has finally left the rich textures of its recent history behind. The company changed the direction of its mobile and desktop software in less than a year, moving from green felt and faux leather to flat panels, thin type, and soft gradients. The timing of the change is no coincidence: Scott Forstall, Apple's head of iOS since forever, left the company in October 2012, leaving room for Jony Ive and Craig Federighi to take the reins. What does that transition mean? Two experienced people are spearheading the look and feel of all the company’s software. There’s plenty of work to be done, but Apple fans can rest assured that the company’s mobile and desktop software appears, at least, to be in capable hands. From the risk of developing an illness to the roots of ancestry, each year brings with it new information on what we can glean from our genetic makeup. But as the burgeoning field progresses, it’s also running up against regulatory roadblocks — ones that, as 2013 showed, have the potential to vastly transform how our genetic data is used and what it might teach us. First came a landmark Supreme Court decision, wherein justices ruled that a company called Myriad Genetics couldn’t hold a patent on two genes involved in breast cancer risk. The ruling was narrow in scope, but it’s expected to somewhat stymie monopolies on genetic tests. Unfortunately, just as the field started to feel more open, the FDA slammed a door shut: in November, the agency ruled that 23andMe’s genomics test violated federal regulations, striking a resounding blow to the dream of personally managed genetic data. In February 2010, a young Army private named Bradley Manning provided nearly 750,000 classified US government documents to the online publisher WikiLeaks. Arrested several months later, he faced 22 charges; the most serious, aiding the enemy, carried a potential death sentence. Manning’s court-martial began in December, 201,1 and this year Manning received a 35-year sentence, handed down just as the NSA documents leaked by Edward Snowden had begun to make international headlines.  From prison, Manning declared herself female, asking to be addressed as “Chelsea.” Since then, she has fought to receive hormone therapy and, around Thanksgiving, issued a public statement thanking those “who dare to ask probing, even dangerous, questions.” Manning’s lawyer believes that she could be paroled in February 2020.  Dim approval ratings for Congress are nothing new, but in 2013 they dropped to the lowest since we started tracking such things in earnest — and for very good reason. Congress spent the vast majority of the year deadlocked, a situation that ultimately led to a government shutdown. That meant everything from NASA to government email to President Obama’s surveillance review panel went on hiatus. And our legislators didn’t do much to respond to the leaks that revealed the scope of the NSA’s spying, either, despite a growing consensus that it must be scaled back. In all, Congress made lots of noise, expressed way too much fury, and did precious little of significance. 2013 wasn’t the best year for Facebook. The company’s initial public offering in 2012 was a notorious underwriting disaster, and its newest products — Facebook Home, a revamped News Feed, and Graph Search — didn’t make much of a splash. The HTC First, what many called “The Facebook Phone,” was a flop. The company also battled a gamut of publicity problems ranging from PRISM and rumors that teens were leaving the social network in droves to research that showed prolonged Facebook use caused depression. Facebook stock has since bounced back, but Home was a flop, and the company’s new News Feed hasn’t sent engagement rates soaring. Meanwhile, photo-sharing apps like Snapchat and messaging apps like WhatsApp have begun eating into Facebook’s dominance. The company finds itself in a tough position, betting its mobile chips on its mid-2012 acquisition of Instagram and its life on finding “the next billion” users. Facebook has grown large in every way. By trying to do too much, the company achieved too little. 2013 was a rough year for BlackBerry. The once-reigning king of the smartphone world finally launched its much-delayed next-generation BlackBerry 10 operating system, but it utterly failed to catch on with smartphone buyers, and BlackBerry fell into a tailspin of declining market share and even worse financial reports. BlackBerry also launched BBM for iOS and Android, but delays and a rocky start put it far behind market leaders such as WhatsApp. Eventually the company announced that it would exit the consumer market and focus on its enterprise business. Shortly after a failed attempt to find someone to buy the company, BlackBerry ousted CEO Thorsten Heins and replaced him with outsider John Chen, who promptly tried to ease worries that the company was going away. Chen is now tasked with turning around a company that just reported it sells three times as many of its old, BlackBerry 7 smartphones as it does of the new BlackBerry 10 models. BlackBerry’s turmoil this year highlight just how competitive the smartphone market is. It’s dominated by two platforms, and while Microsoft’s deep pockets enable it to hang on to a small percentage of the market for third place, there’s clearly no room for a successful fourth player. Despite the great strides made in content, moving internet-based television forward proved to be about as effective as dragging a sleeping cat. After months of rumors Intel confirmed that it was working on an internet-based television system that would provide live TV and on-demand programming… until it couldn’t close licensing deals and had to scrap the whole initiative. Microsoft touted the Xbox One’s ability to integrate live television as a glimpse into the future, but relying on an existing set-top box and IR blaster is more clunky alliance than revolution. And, of course, another 12 months passed without Apple releasing a branded television of its own. The most remarkable innovation we saw come to market was from Aereo, a company that relies on some careful legal language and a ton of tiny antennas to let users watch broadcast television streamed to them online. Of course, the entrenched powers were none too happy, and Aereo’s found itself in a series of ever-escalating copyright cases that appear headed to the Supreme Court. The desire for internet-based TV is there. The technology for internet-based TV is there. Maybe 2014 will be the year the incumbents in the TV industry stop disrupting the disruptors. It’s hardly a new phenomenon, but mark 2013 as the year that the impact of climate change gained serious momentum among scientists and governments alike. In September, a landmark UN report put the crisis into stark perspective: the reality of a warming planet is “unequivocal,” the report stated, and human activities are nearly certainly at fault. That report was echoed by other high-profile studies throughout the year: a widely publicized Nature paper found that unprecedented high temperatures will be commonplace by 2047, while another concluded that upwards of 1.5 billion people could soon face water scarcity as a result of changing climatic conditions. And if the actions of international governments this year are any indication, the grim outlooks in those studies will become a reality. At fractious UN climate talks in Warsaw, Poland, countries tussled over emissions goals and financial reparations before reaching disappointingly modest agreements on both. In the US, President Obama made climate change one of his key stumping points — all while releasing a fatally flawed plan to combat the issue, and punting any decisions about the controversial Keystone XL pipeline. The iPad Air doesn’t have a great story — if anything, it’s indicative of Apple’s dedication to evolving its products rather than compulsively rethinking them. But while it may not be the most interesting or surprising product to launch this year, there’s no question it’s one of the best. Apple’s larger tablet now comes with a desktop-class processor, an incredibly high-resolution screen, a 1-pound body that’s both immersive and portable, and Apple’s huge and growing App Store. The iPad is one of the most popular gaming machines in the world, and it’s as good a Netflix machine as ever. But it’s no accident that Apple likes to show off the iPad Air by demoing Pages and iMovie, or that it’s made them all free to use — this tablet is built for creating, and it’s coming after your computer.  Motorola was purchased by Google in 2012, but it wasn’t until this year that the company released the Moto X, a device that clearly bore the influence of its new overlords. The Moto X defied the spec race by offering hardware that was just “good enough,” but when added together became greater than the sum of its parts. The company also demonstrated how minor, innovative additions to Android offer a better experience than a complete revision of the platform, as many other manufacturers choose to do. Other innovative features of the Moto X include the Moto Maker service, which lets customers order a custom-designed phone through Motorola’s website and have it shipped right to their door. Finally, thanks to Google’s financial backing, Motorola became the first company to sell a smartphone assembled in the US. Motorola hasn’t yet been able to attain the commercial sales success of its competitors with the Moto X, but it has the deep pockets of Google behind it to keep trying. Wearable technology has been on the fringe of the gadget world for years, but in 2013, it jumped into the mainstream consciousness. Kickstarter darling Pebble finally launched its smartwatch, and although it is far from perfect, smartwatches have been a hot topic ever since. Samsung released its ill-received Galaxy Gear, which was considered far too big, expensive, and limited by many, while Sony followed up with the SmartWatch 2, its best effort in the category yet. Smartwatches weren’t the only wearables in the spotlight: numerous fitness trackers from the likes of Fitbit, Nike, and others launched this year, some of which even tried to incorporate smartwatch-like features, albeit without much success. We’re still waiting for the long-rumored wearable devices from Apple and Google to actually be a real thing, but 2013 showed that wearable technology is going to stay. Everybody likes cheap computers, but no one likes them when they’re slow and underpowered. So Google made Chrome OS, the web-based operating system that doesn’t need high-end hardware or customized software to work well. After a few fits and starts, Chrome OS took off in 2013 — our work and lives are moving ever more into a web browser, and with native apps and offline support a web browser feels a lot less like a compromise on a Chromebook. Meanwhile, manufacturers began to buy in: Acer, Samsung, HP, and others all made Chromebooks that squeeze good performance and good battery life into small, inexpensive packages. Chromebooks sit perpetually at the top of Amazon’s best-seller lists — turns out people still love cheap computers. But in 2013, cheap computers didn’t have to be bad anymore. For gamers, 2013 was a year of waiting. Both Sony's PlayStation 4 and Microsoft's Xbox One were announced early on in the year, but it wasn't until November that we finally got our hands on the next-generation game consoles. And the two devices took very different approaches. Microsoft initially unveiled some ambitious features for its console only to scale them back when consumers balked at the idea of an always-online console that couldn’t play used games. It also continued its Kinect push, while furthering the idea of an Xbox as the center of your living room. Sony, meanwhile, tried to label the PS4 as a return to the brand’s early days, describing it as a device built for both gamers and game developers. It didn't have all of the features of the Xbox and was priced at $100 cheaper. Once the two machines finally arrived, they turned out to be remarkably similar in at least one way: they're both still works in progress. While we’ve rendered our early verdicts on the PS4 and Xbox One, with a few software updates and a more robust lineup of games, these will be very different machines in a short period of time. America’s war on drugs entered uncharted territory this year, after Colorado and Washington became the first states to decriminalize the recreational use of marijuana. Legalization advocates touted the laws as a turning point for US drug policy, and raised hopes that other states may follow suit. Still, major uncertainties loom on the horizon. Authorities in both states spent much of 2013 crafting strict rules that’ll govern how marijuana is distributed and regulated once it becomes legal, but many have raised doubts over their ability to both oversee the industry and guarantee public safety. Casting a shadow over all of this is the fact that marijuana remains illegal under federal law, although Colorado and Washington will at least be able to see their experiments through. The Justice Department says it won’t challenge the laws as long as strong regulations are in place, setting the stage for what’s sure to be a fascinating 2014. Marijuana sales begin in Colorado on January 1st, and in Washington later this spring.    In 1998, it was the iMac. In 2001, the iPod. 2007 brought the iPhone, and the iPad came in 2010. Apple’s remarkable 15-year run has seen it both invent markets and utterly dominate them — and every few years, Steve Jobs would come on stage and announce Apple’s next target. Amid deafening rumor and speculation in 2013, however, Apple stayed its course: upgrade, not overhaul. The chorus will only grow louder in 2014: will Apple finally release the TV set Steve Jobs famously said he’d “cracked?” Will it identify in the nascent smartwatch market the same thing it saw in MP3 players, solve problems in both design and software, and release the first truly mainstream wearable? The iPhone 5C introduced color to the otherwise mostly monochromatic world of Apple hardware designs — will its other products follow suit? Maybe Apple will stay the course again next year, updating Macs, iPads, and iPhones to an audience of upgraders. Or maybe it’ll swing for the fences again and find another industry in need of an overhaul. Either way, everyone’s watching. In 2014, virtual reality may finally have a chance to be more than a ‘90s-era pipe dream. Oculus VR has now raised over $100 million to commercialize its critically acclaimed virtual reality headset — the Oculus Rift — and attracted a raft of talent to ensure the device doesn’t become just another failed PC peripheral. The firm now counts famed video game programmer John Carmack as its chief technical officer, hard at work on an Android version of the system, not to mention former EA Partners and Origin dealmaker David DeMartini, who will use some of the company’s newfound cash to lure game developers to the platform. The company already has a new prototype headset that allegedly does away with motion sickness, but there are at least two major challenges ahead: figuring out how to build compelling games for virtual reality, and finding a natural way to control those games with your hands. Tech people have always liked big promises, but in 2013, they got bigger and more outlandish. The weirdest part is, we started to believe them. When Amazon announced it would start replacing UPS with autonomous miniature helicopters (read that again), we doubted the regulation more than the technology. By that point, we’d seen Google promising immortality and inching closer to self-driving cars, all while they used balloons to broadcast the internet over remote parts of the globe. And that’s saying nothing of Elon Musk, Mr. Moonshot himself, who continued to develop his once-outlandish electric car and spaceflight schemes, then dropped blueprints for a next-generation maglev like it was an extra-credit paper.  It won’t all happen, but a lot of it’s happening already. Haters fumed and bankers scratched their heads, but more than during any other year in memory, companies were willing to gamble on an interesting idea. The payoff, if it comes, will be when one of those moonshots actually makes it to the moon. Despite early assertions from the White House, Congress, and the intelligence community that the NSA’s out-of-control programs were properly sanctioned by all three branches of government, the tide of public opinion may be turning against secret mass government surveillance. Lawmakers, private technology companies, and advocacy groups have increased pressure in the months following Snowden’s initial leaks, calling for NSA reform. Just this month the president’s NSA review panel, widely expected by critics to produce few results, offered sweeping, unexpected recommendations to reform the NSA and end bulk collection of phone records.  But even an end to NSA bulk surveillance won’t resolve some of the most critical privacy issues facing Americans. The Electronic Communications Privacy Act, a wildly out-of-date 1986 law, established that sensitive metadata isn’t subject to Fourth and Fifth Amendment protections. There is some hope, however, that the government's position on metadata protection may soon change; in December, a federal judge ruled that the NSA’s bulk collection of phone records is likely unconstitutional, noting that the government’s spying programs are “based in large part on a 34-year-old Supreme Court precedent, the relevance of which has been eclipsed by technological advances and a cellphone-centric lifestyle heretofore inconceivable.”   ",0.6383768033847004,0.3616231966152996,0.8499984719465239,5583,5.1443668278703205,2397,6.8335419274092617,0,21,"Tech, US & World, Report",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

Appelbaum, who co-wrote the Der Spiegel article that first revealed the NSA catalog, went into further detail onstage, describing several individual devices in the catalog and their intended purposes. The exploits could be delivered by drone Alongside pre-packaged exploits that allowed control over iOS devices and any phone communicating through GSM, Appelbaum detailed a device that targets computers through packet injection, seeding exploits from up to 8 miles away. He even speculated the exploits could be delivered by drone, although he conceded that in most cases, an unmarked van would likely be more practical. The brochure in question dates from 2007, suggesting capabilities may have advanced even further since then — but Appelbaum left little doubt that he believes these tactics are still in use, and offered several instances in which he's seen them in action. One case involved Julian Assange's current home at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, where visitors were surprised to receive welcome messages from a Ugandan telephone company. It turned out the messages were coming from a foreign base station device installed on the roof, masquerading as a cell tower for surveillance purposes. Appelbaum suspects the GCHQ simply forgot to reformat the device from an earlier Ugandan operation.

You’d expect electricity demand to skyrocket accordingly, but the trend is actually the opposite. Total electricity use in the US has actually declined in the past four out of five years, according to a new government study, and many analysts expect that to continue. Electricity use was growing around 10 percent per year in the 1950s, but slowed to about 1 percent in recent years and was down almost 2 percent in 2012. There are a number of reasons why, but the change is largely due to gains in energy efficiency: new homes, office buildings, and electrical devices are more efficient than ever, especially now that new lighting standards are being phased in. Changing consumer behavior also played a big part Changing consumer behavior also played a big part. In 2012, 83 percent of customers said they took step to reduce their electricity consumption, according to market research by Deloitte, up from 68 percent in 2011. At the same time, people are installing more home solar panels, although the exact rate of growth is hard to measure. Temporary factors such as the recession, which led Americans to cut back on usage, and warm winters, which reduce the need for heating, also contributed to the decline. Electricity use is still growing in some areas. Data centers consumed 29 terawatt hours of energy in 2011 and are expected to increase to 95 terawatt hours by 2040, according to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA). Demand from electric cars and other modes of transportation is growing even faster at around 3.6 percent a year, according to the EIA, but from a much smaller starting point. Other miscellaneous uses, such as the relatively recent popularity of large video displays in commercial buildings, are ticking up at around 2 percent a year. The overall trend toward efficiency seems to be strong enough to overcome these new sources of demand, however. That fact has some analysts crying doom for the utility sector, considering the demand for their product is going down. Utilities are also under pressure to make expensive upgrades in order to repair aging infrastructure and comply with environmental regulations. These companies are perhaps most worried about the trend in home solar generation, which may be the strongest indicator that centralized electricity use really is declining. They’re even lobbying state-by-state to charge home solar generators extra fees. There are also hints of new forms of distributed electricity generation, such as electric car chargers that can send electricity back to the grid. ""Decoupling"" separates profits from usage"" Energy companies in states that have adopted a new pricing model called ""decoupling"" don't have this problem. The name refers to the idea of separating profits from usage, so that energy companies are incentivized to sell less energy, not more. Pacific Gas & Electric, which serves most of California, has operated on this model for three decades. State regulators limit PG&E’s profits so that the company has no incentive to encourage customers to buy more electricity. Meanwhile, the company gets paid for making infrastructure investments and meeting environmental targets. That means PG&E actually encourages customers to install solar panels, make data centers efficient, and charge their electric cars during off-peak hours. Customers are still charged more for using more electricity under most decoupling schemes, but it’s complicated. If you’re a PG&E customer, you’re placed in one of four price tiers based on your monthly usage. If you use more electricity, your cost per kilowatt hour is higher. Then, you pay based on how many kilowatt hours you use. However, if PG&E sells more electricity than it estimated — say it’s an unusually hot summer or cold winter — the company will have to give that money back in the form of refunds to customers. Critics of decoupling say a straightforward, pay-for-what-you-use scheme would be more effective in getting customers to reduce their electricity use. However, there are efficiencies to be gained through centralization: a Tesla charging station is likely to be more efficient than your plug at home, just as a data center in the desert is likely to be less wasteful than sticking servers in your closet. By the end of 2012, 52 natural gas utilities and 25 electric utilities in 25 states had decoupled their revenues. If the downward trend in electricity use continues, we will probably see more decoupling around the country. For years, energy efficiency was driven by regulation. It now seems that technological advances and cultural attitudes have taken over.",0.5392874037068421,0.46071259629315786,0.6324862757808432,777,5.2149292149292146,419,6.1742243436754176,0,0,"US & World, Report",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

According to the guidelines as originally interpreted, both companies and individuals trading in the cryptocurrency would need to register with the US government as money-services businesses, putting a great burden on those only mining Bitcoin for themselves. Now, according to correspondence sent to one Bitcoin company, FinCEN has clarified its language to let miners off the hook. No need to register if you mine Bitcoin for yourself alone According to Bitcoin blog CoinText, FinCEN gave the clarification to Atlantic City Bitcoin, a facility that operates hardware for miners in New Jersey. In the letter, the bureau explains, ""To the extent that a user mines Bitcoin and uses the Bitcoin solely for the user’s own purposes and not for the benefit of another, the user is not an MSB under FinCEN’s regulations, because these activities involve neither ""acceptance"" nor ""transmission"" of the convertible virtual currency and are not the transmission of funds..."" The letter goes on to explain that users who transmit or convert funds for second parties would still have to register. The news should come as some relief to organizations like the Bitcoin Foundation, which voiced displeasure when FinCEN made the rulings back in March.

The report indicates that the NSA, in collaboration with the CIA and FBI, routinely and secretly intercepts shipping deliveries for laptops or other computer accessories in order to implant bugs before they reach their destinations. According to Der Spiegel, the NSA's TAO group is able to divert shipping deliveries to its own ""secret workshops"" in a method called interdiction, where agents load malware onto the electronics or install malicious hardware that can give US intelligence agencies remote access. While the report does not indicate the scope of the program, or who the NSA is targeting with such wiretaps, it's a unique look at the agency's collaborative efforts with the broader intelligence community to gain hard access to communications equipment. One of the products the NSA appears to use to compromise target electronics is codenamed COTTONMOUTH, and has been available since 2009; it's a USB ""hardware implant"" that secretly provides the NSA with remote access to the compromised machine. This tool, among others, is available to NSA agents through what Der Spiegel describes as a mail-order spy catalog. The report indicates that the catalog offers backdoors into the hardware and software of the most prominent technology makers, including Cisco, Juniper Networks, Dell, Seagate, Western Digital, Maxtor, Samsung, and Huawei. Many of the targets are American companies. The report indicates that the NSA can even exploit error reports from Microsoft's Windows operating system; by intercepting the error reports and determining what's wrong with a target's computer, the NSA can then attack it with Trojans or other malware. In response to Der Spiegel's report, Cisco senior vice president John Stewart wrote that ""we are deeply concerned with anything that may impact the integrity of our products or our customers' networks,"" and that the company does ""not work with any government to weaken our products for exploitation."" Other US companies have fired back against reports of NSA tampering in recent months, including Microsoft, which labeled the agency an ""advanced persistent threat"" over its efforts to secretly collect private user data within the internal networks of Google and Yahoo.  Sometimes the NSA hops on an FBI jet for high-tech raids The Der Spiegel report, which gives a broad look at TAO operations, also highlights the NSA's cooperation with other intelligence agencies to conduct Hollywood-style raids. Unlike most of the NSA's operations which allow for remote access to targets, Der Spiegel notes that the TAO's programs often require physical access to targets. To gain physical access, the NSA reportedly works with the CIA and FBI on sensitive missions that sometimes include flying NSA agents on FBI jets to plant wiretaps. ""This gets them to their destination at the right time and can help them to disappear again undetected after even as little as a half hour's work,"" the report notes. The NSA currently faces pressure from the public, Congress, federal courts, and privacy advocates over its expansive spying programs. Those programs, which include bulk telephone surveillance of American citizens, are said by critics to violate constitutional protections against unreasonable searches, and were uncovered earlier this year by whistleblower Edward Snowden. Beyond the programs that scoop up data on American citizens, Snowden's documents have also given a much closer look at how the spy agency conducts other surveillance operations, including tapping the phones of high-level foreign leaders.",0.8276975037217019,0.17230249627829808,0.8758059058816435,588,5.4472789115646263,344,6.5145348837209305,0,0,"Tech, US & World",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

First the director of Art House Convergence, a coalition of 250 independent movie theaters, posted an open letter to Sony Pictures' Michael Lynton and Amy Pascal, writing that the members of the independent art house community would screen The Interview — either as a free, one-off screening, or as part of their regular programming. Today Art House Convergence is upping the ante with a petition at Change.org, allowing theater owners to publicly pledge to Sony that they will screen the embattled film. ""We are at an important crossroads with an opportunity to reaffirm clearly our dedication to the value of freedom and the absolute necessity to keep our film industry free of restriction, censorship and violent intimidation,"" the petition reads. ""We implore our fellow exhibitors and our nation of moviegoers to stand up in recognition that freedom of speech and artistic expression are vital not only to the entertainment industry but for all art and commerce worldwide."" Indie theaters were still selling tickets when Sony canceled The matter of distribution channels — and how much they truly impacted Sony's decision to pull The Interview — has become an issue of considerable debate over the past week. After the group behind the Sony hack threatened violence on any theaters that showed the film, Sony Pictures spoke to the major theater chains and told them it would understand if they decided to not screen the movie. With that opt-out clearly in place, theater owners took advantage, with all major chains declining to screen the film as of last Wednesday. (With the holidays serving as the last big ticket push before the end of the year, theater owners were no doubt concerned that threats of violence would depress attendance — not just for The Interview, but for the numerous other films opening Christmas Day.) Sony then cancelled The Interview altogether, a move that it has portrayed as a fait accompli — even though independent theaters like the Alamo Drafthouse were still selling tickets to the movie when Sony made its call. When asked Friday why the company wouldn't distribute the movie online in some form instead, Sony Pictures CEO Michael Lynton shifted blamed to distributors again, claiming that no partner had ""stepped forward"" — even though the studio should have both Sony-owned Crackle and the PlayStation Network at its disposal. Initiatives like the Art House Convergence petition are part of a growing chorus of voices demanding that Sony take some sort of action to release the film (a theater in New York is even planning a live reading of the script as ""an opportunity for people to come together in the name of free speech""). At this point it's becoming increasingly obvious that there are indeed avenues to release The Interview — the only question is if Sony has the will to do so.",0.47651775810904284,0.5234822418909572,0.17575469740808655,503,5.0238568588469183,274,6.0729927007299267,0,0,"Culture, Entertainment",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Today, Apple released OS X 10.10.3, a free update for Macs that adds the new app, as well as a handful of other features and fixes to its five-month-old operating system. The new Photos app was designed not only to replace iPhoto and Aperture, but also to play better with the photos and videos people have captured on their iPhones and iPads. That means that the editing tools are the same, and that your edits carry over no matter what device you're on, the same way Apple's handled some of its iCloud syncing in iWork office apps like Pages and Keynote. You get some new features, but lose others The arrival of Photos also signals the demise of iPhoto, which this new app replaces and modernizes. Many of its features are present in the app, but some have also been changed or are missing. For the most part though, its additions make it a worthwhile update, including the advent of iCloud Photo Library, which syncs full-quality photos and videos between devices almost instantaneously. This also lets people keep a copy of their photo library in the cloud, which can save serious space on people's computers. However the option also means you'll very likely need to pay to upgrade your iCloud storage plan. We go into more detail about what's new, and how all this works in our explainer, which you can read here. Apple originally showed off the new Photos app at its developer conference last June, though developers didn't get their hands on the software until early February. Apple opened it up to a wider batch of testers in its Appleseed testing program last month, so that both groups could squash bugs. Also in today's update are 300 new multicultural emoji, Spotlight suggestions, and support for two-step verification on some web accounts like Google. Apple also says the update improves Wi-Fi performance, and improves reliability when screen sharing.

Taking them is easier than ever. So is sharing them. But storing and organizing them all in different places still manages to be an experience filled with gotchas, and one that varies wildly depending on what companies you’ve sworn allegiance to with your phone and computer. And if that company’s been Apple, you’ve basically been a guinea pig in a good idea that was hastily (and poorly) executed.  Apple might have just fixed that for Mac users with the new Photos app. It’s the final piece in a plan that Apple unveiled last June, and one that both fixes and unifies a patchwork system it rolled out in 2011. It’s a rethink of how people manage their photo library on a Mac, something that’s been iPhoto’s home turf for more than a decade. Apple’s discontinuing that software along with Aperture (which is aimed at pro photographers), in favor bringing the tools people have on their iPhones and iPads to the Mac. It’s also been built with Apple’s iCloud in mind instead of an afterthought, which feels years overdue.  At a high level here's three things that anyone thinking of using Photos for OS X should know: As simple as Photos is, the devil is in the details, and there are quite a few details here. Familiar features have moved or changed, and in classic Apple fashion, some have also been quietly removed. Here are some things you should be aware of now that the software's available to everyone. If you’ve been using the iCloud Photo Library beta for iOS 8, you’ll be pretty familiar with how Photos for OS X works. Rather than the old ""My Photo Stream"" feature, which pushed 1,000 photos (or 30 days worth of photos) across your Mac and iOS devices, everything you shoot on your iPhone will automatically get uploaded to iCloud. When you open up Photos on your Mac, you’ll see everything you shot in a view that’s nearly identical to what you see in iOS — all your photos are organized by date and location. You can zoom out to a year overview or zoom in and see any particular photo or video. Apple’s also included the see-every-photo-as-a-microscopic-thumbnail view to navigate several hundred photos at a time. Every image in the cloud, if you want What is probably most noteworthy about the new app is that Apple is no longer simply using iCloud to share your photos across devices — if you choose, you can now store every image and video you shoot on your iPhone in iCloud. To help make this work without taking up a ton of storage, Apple is also giving users the option to optimize storage on their devices. Instead of locally storing every image in full resolution, you can opt to have the full images live in iCloud; smaller, optimized images that take up much less storage space will instead be displayed on your mobile devices and even on your Mac. At any time, you can choose to download the full-size image if you’re so inclined. Of course, if you buy into this setup, you’ll be trusting Apple to keep all the originals safe in iCloud. Fortunately, you can set it up so that the Photos app on your Mac keeps all the original, full-size images stored locally if you so choose. You’re still free to choose the optimized setting on your iOS devices to save space there.  If you’re a photographer who shoots with a standalone digital camera, Photos will happily import both JPG and RAW files and treat them much like the photos you shoot on an iPhone. If you have Photos set to upload everything to iCloud, it’ll store the original, full-size images in the cloud and sync them across your devices. It’s worth noting that Photos for OS X obfuscates the file system even more than iPhoto or Aperture do — once you import photos from your camera, it seems to be impossible to locate the original file in the Finder, even if you have Photos set to store the original, full-size images on your computer rather than only keep them in iCloud. Those who want to maintain absolute control over their images will probably want to save original files in Finder and then import the best shots into Photos for further work and sharing. Beyond simply providing a much better way of organizing your photos and videos across multiple devices, the new Photos app for OS X does much of what its predecessor did — you can make a wide variety of edits (more on this later), create calendars and books, use face detection to sort photos by the people that are in them, share them with iCloud or across some third-party services, and more. Nearly every feature included in iPhoto is present here in Photos, and Apple has finally fixed its confusing cloud-syncing solutions in favor of something much simpler and smarter. It really depends on how you were using those two apps. This is eminently more lightweight than either of those two, and more familiar to iOS. You basically get the same set of filters, controls, and effects you’ll find on iOS, and everything gets synced up the second it's done. Also, the photos you have stored in your iCloud Photo Library no longer feel tacked on the way the My Photo Stream feature did in iPhoto and Aperture. Now, if you were one of the people who loved Aperture because you like adjusting every possible little setting, and having things like a loupe for pixel-peeping, adjustment brushes for fixing dust spots or blown highlights, and plug-ins to add extra features, here’s some bad news: none of these things are present in Photos. Dedicated iPhoto users should find plenty to like about the new OS X Photos app, though. For more details on this, see our in-depth preview. As mentioned before, this is a completely new app with changes to both its look and feel, and how you edit photos. But there are a few new features. Pretty much everything that is in iPhoto can be found in Photos, but some things did not make the cut. It’s worth noting we were using a pre-release version of the software, and things could be added in future releases. Either you keep everything on your Mac, or sync up everything in your Photos library with your iCloud Photo Library. That means no selecting certain photos of events to sync up. Power users might hate that, but the feature’s been designed so you don’t have to remember to flag items — something that’s tedious with larger libraries. It’s worth noting that even if you choose to sync your photos with iCloud Photo Library, you can still keep the original files stored locally on your Mac while having your library mirrored across multiple devices. Photos can be used without iCloud Photo Library, and thus your iCloud storage. You can keep both photos and videos in the Photos app, just like you could with iPhoto and Aperture. You can also keep using iCloud’s Photo Stream feature, though it does not store full quality versions of your photos and won't even transfer videos. Once you've upgraded to iCloud Photo Library, Photo Stream as we've known it is replaced by All Photos. If you do want to flip on iCloud Photo Library, Photos provides an estimation of how much storage it will take. If that goes over the free amount you have from Apple, you can subscribe to one of its various storage tiers, just like you can from iOS devices. Apple gives you 5GB for free, but keep in mind that you’re also sharing that space with things like iCloud backups, as well as files you have stored in iCloud Drive. Photos you’ve taken on your iPhone count separately from those backups, but can eat into that space quickly. Apple Photos won’t make this worse if you’re just snapping shots with your iPhone or iPad, but it definitely will if you plan to store RAW photos from a DSLR and 1080p videos. Currently, Apple offers four different tiers of extra iCloud storage, which have varying costs depending on what country you’re in. In the US, at least, it’s 99 cents a month for 20GB, $3.99 a month for 200GB, $9.99 a month for 500GB, and $19.99 a month to jump to 1TB. Both pieces of software will live on, for now, though are no longer being developed by Apple. Photos is the new iPhoto, basically, so your library is transferred over. Aperture users, however, can continue to use Aperture if they want to make more advanced edits. But those edits made in Aperture won’t sync over to Photos and vice versa. No. Apple will let you move your iPhoto or Aperture library into Photos and preserve your edits. However, because Apple changed some of its organizational tools, some things do get lost or changed in translation from an iPhoto or Aperture library. Star ratings get turned into hearts (or favorites), and projects are turned into albums. Other metadata is retained but will only show up in search. You need to search for things like color labels and flags. Also, if you’ve added custom metadata fields to any photos in Aperture, those fields do not carry over. For iOS users, there’s nothing to do. If you’ve turned on iCloud Photo Library, all your photos and albums will show up in Photos. For iOS users, there’s nothing to do Apple has built it into OS X 10.10.3, which was released today. Once you've updated (through the Mac App Store), the app will be automatically installed. On the Mac? Of course. The same thing goes with your iPhone or iPad. Pretty much every company now, including Amazon, Box, Dropbox, Google, Flickr, and Microsoft have apps that will perfectly and seamlessly sync your camera roll to their servers. The key reason to use this is if you’re the kind of person who does not want to deal with setting up another service, and both likes and wants to use Apple’s tools.

Coming later this month, the base model will cost $499, and it will also be sold with an attachable backlit keyboard for $629.   Like it did with the Venue 8 7000, Dell is playing around with the traditional form factor of a tablet with this new model. The 10-inch tablet is mostly a thin slab of dark, brushed aluminum, but it has a big metal cylinder that runs along one of the longer sides. That serves a couple of purposes: it houses the battery and some internals, it's where the keyboard attaches, and it has some ergonomic value in that it gives you something more substantial to hold than just a bit of aluminum and glass. The shape is off-putting at first, but it did feel like it could offer some benefit, and it definitely felt less awkward to hold than the Venue 8 7000.            If you put the price and shape aside, this is a really capable tablet. It's got the same gorgeous 2560 x 1600 OLED display and the same quick quad-core Atom chip as the Venue 8 7000, and both of those hold up great in the new form factor. It fits all that in almost the same thin package, too, as the Venue 10 7000 measures just 6.2mm thick. Along the smaller sides of the Venue 10 you'll find a micro USB port, headphone jack, and a MicroSD slot that can expand the storage up to 512GB. The Venue 10 is almost twice as heavy as the Venue 8 — 598 grams compared to 305 — but most of that weight is in the cylinder. Intel's RealSense camera is back again, too, though it's still hard to find real utility for the technology. It doesn't help that you still have to use the sluggish and unintuitive camera and gallery software made by Dell, even if this tablet runs the rest of Android Lollipop quite smoothly. One key difference with the Venue 10 is that it has a big 7,000 mAh battery, but it apparently won't necessarily translate to better battery life. Dell told us in a briefing last month that you'd be able to use the tablet for up to 15 hours even with the keyboard attached, but with today's announcement the company is claiming only 7 hours of battery life. That's even less than what the Venue 8 7000 offers, and it takes away what would have been a great selling point — especially since Dell hopes this tablet will take off in the business world. While terrible portable keyboards are easy to find, the one that Dell is selling alongside the Venue 10 isn't one of them. The keys are responsive, the back-lighting is strong enough to be useful in a dim room, and it even has a trackpad that works well. It easily slots and snaps into the tablet, and it can be folded around 180 degrees as well. It also isn't too easy to remove after it locks in place, which is a good thing. When you attach the keyboard, the whole rig does feel like a great option for getting some work done in a cramped space. It's like a compact, lightweight version of the two-in-one laptops that we've seen more of over the last few years. It's also nicely balanced — when you reach up to tap on the screen it's not easy to knock the whole thing backwards.

David Bowie crooned in the 1971 glam rock hit of the same name. Four years later, NASA launched the twin Viking missions to the Red Planet in part to help answer that very question. They became the first spacecraft to land on another planet in human history. Almost forty years and 17 attempted missions to Mars later, we still don't know for sure if the planet has or ever had life. Even with this week's exciting news that the Curiosity rover discovered the most conclusive evidence yet that Mars was able to support life, and despite many previous claims of evidence for life on Mars, it's going to take even more proof to be able to say for sure whether something ever actually lived on Mars and, most importantly, whether it still does.  NASA announced the latest evidence in support of Martian habitability earlier this week. It's important to distinguish between habitability, the environmental conditions necessary for life as we know it, and evidence of living organisms themselves. Curiosity was only designed to look for evidence of habitability; namely, liquid water, sources of energy, and chemicals that simple, single-celled microbial life require. Proof of life itself is different: first you need a habitable environment, but then you also need to find traces of organic compounds with the right concentration of elements, a much rarer combination, even here on Earth. Curiosity can't measure these, so it's not even technically capable of finding life on Mars. In fact, the only mission where that was even a goal was on the Viking landers from nearly 40 years ago, and those results remain controversial to this day. Habitability is not the same thing as life But Curiosity did find new evidence that Mars was able to support life at one point,  analyzing a powdery rock sample, vacuumed up after drilling a 2.5-inch hole into the rock, located in a giant depression near the Martian equator known as Gale Crater. Earlier in the Curiosity mission, scientists determined that at least part of this area was previously covered by a stream about three billion years ago, long since dried up, so NASA's science team knew to target an area that would be likelier than others on Mars to be friendly to life. And as luck and the skill of knowing where to look might have it, it yielded some data NASA says is impressive.   Looped animation of Curiosity drilling into the surface of Mars over several hours. ""This is what we call 'paydirt,'"" said David Blake, a scientist with the mission, in NASA's press conference to discuss the results. Blake invented and oversees an instrument on the small car-sized rover that examines the chemical and mineralogical makeup of the Martian surface with X-rays (CheMin). That instrument and another one, the sample analysis on Mars instrument (SAM), together detected traces of sulfur, nitrogen, hydrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and carbon in the rock powder, elements that sustain life on Earth. ""No previous evidence about a wet Martian environment has included all of those factors."" When the rover drilled into gray clay below the Martian surface, it also found chemicals that were partially oxidized and not oxidized at all. That was something of a surprise, as Mars' surface is heavily oxidized (oxidation is the process that leads to rust, which explains the Red Planet's signature color). To top it off, the rover also found the clay below the surface contained minerals that were likely produced by ""relatively"" fresh water. ""No previous evidence about a wet Martian environment has included all of those factors,"" Joy Crisp, deputy project scientist for the Curiosity mission, told The Verge via email. Viking was the only mission to look for life itself So where does this leave us? There remains just one set of missions that pointed to not just a habitable Mars in the past, but signs of current life. NASA's twin Viking landers themselves, Vikings 1 and 2, which touched down about 4,000 miles apart from each other on opposite sides of the Red Planet back in 1976. Each stationary Viking lander conducted three biological experiments. One of those, the labeled release experiment, involved releasing drops of nutrient water on spots of Martian soil and then waiting 10 days to see if microorganisms would consume the nutrients and release gaseous byproducts like methane and carbon monoxide, which the landers would be able to detect.   Viking lander 2 imagery of the Utopian Plane on Mars. But in the initial trials on both landers, gas was immediately and rapidly emitted. Subsequent trials a week later didn't turn up the same results, and none of the other biological experiments on the landers turned up positive results, leading scientists at the time to conclude that there wasn't strong enough evidence to support the existence of microbial life on Mars. ""Life is phenomenally tough. If it ever got started on Mars, chances are it still exists."" The conclusion Viking found no life has been called into question in the years that followed, including by some current Curiosity scientists. But the strongest opposition comes from a review of the Viking data last year, led by an associate professor of cell and neurobiology at the University of Southern California's Keck School of Medicine. ""The results of that experiment still constitute the best evidence for current life on Mars,"" said Joseph Miller, the lead author of the study, in an email to The Verge. Miller's study ran the old Viking data through new mathematical probability models to determine how likely it was that the Viking labeled release results could have been produced by non-living processes and found that it was highly unlikely. ""Life is phenomenally tough,"" Miller said. ""If it ever got started on Mars, chances are it still exists."" Other evidence for life on Mars after Viking came in various forms, but it's all been hotly contested. Perhaps the most famous example, which NASA is still trying to live down, came in 1996, when scientists with the agency made the bombshell announcement that a meteorite from Mars discovered over a decade prior in Antarctica contained ""an apparently unique pattern of organic molecules"" and even ""possible microscopic fossils of primitive, bacteria-like organisms."" Those results were immediately called into question, and though some subsequent studies supported them, many others indicated that the molecules could have been formed by other non-biological processes on Mars.   Photo of the meteorite ALH84001. ""Some microbes can live in ice."" In the years since Viking, evidence of Mars' habitability has mounted as well, and it's been far more solid. Curiosity's new results seem to further underscore a developing consensus that Mars was once watery and able to support life. NASA has had direct evidence the water once flowed on Mars since the Mariner probe first flew over the planet in 1971 and observed canyons, river beds and other forms of water erosion on the surface. But whether or not that water was hospitable was an open question. In 2002, NASA's robotic Mars Odyssey orbiter found evidence of water ice below the surface of Mars and at the north pole, and in 2004, a European spacecraft found evidence of water ice at Mars' north pole. In 2008, NASA's Mars Phoenix lander verified water ice still exists on Mars despite its low atmospheric pressure and low surface temperature, and even bolstered theories that liquid water could still be flowing on the surface of the planet in small amounts thanks to perchlorate, a chemical that lowers water's freezing point. Unfortunately, perchlorate is also not conducive to microbial life. But Miller remains unconvinced. ""Some microbes can live in ice and if you go deep enough there can actually be a liquid interface between ice and soil, a great environment for microbes,"" Miller told The Verge.   Composite image of the ice cap at the Martian North Pole. Curiosity has provided new evidence of higher daytime surface temperatures on Mars than previous missions. But it's also countered habitability notions by finding no significant traces of methane in the atmosphere yet, which does not bode well for the prospect that methane-producing microogranisms ever lived on Mars. Miller has a counter explanation for this.  ""I think methane-producing microbes are likely,"" he said. ""Any Martian microbes would have to tolerate a very low oxygen environment and extreme daily temperature swings. But there are plenty of terrestrial microbes which thrive under such conditions."" ""Viable microbes may live just a few inches down from the top."" Miller also pointed to Curiosity's recent finding that parts of the interior of Mars are gray, or not oxidized and red like the surface, as evidence that microbes could be there right now, just below what we can see. ""Viable microbes may live just a few inches down from the top,"" Miller wrote. ""In fact, this grey soil may be an excellent area to perform another labeled release type experiment in some future mission. However, it might be even better to do that in an area with sub-surface ice."" For NASA, nearly 40 years after it first landed on Mars, it remains too early to make that call. The agency right now is just concerned with proving habitability, which the Curiosity rover seems to have effectively done. NASA's next mission to Mars, an orbital craft called MAVEN, is due to launch later this year to study Mars's atmosphere. The mission after that, InSight, due to launch in 2016, will be another lander that will bore deeper into Mars than even Curiosity can, revealing yet more data on Mars' past. Still, it's doubtful either of these missions will settle the question of life once and for all.",0.6355840672125943,0.3644159327874057,0.5163779410273547,1638,4.9902319902319903,714,6.2773109243697478,0,0,"Science, Report",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Poincheval, after all, is the 65-year-old Frenchman who made international headlines last year for developing a pill that claims to make flatulence smell pleasant. Chocolate-pleasant, but also rose- and violet-pleasant. For Valentine’s Day this year, he came out with a new ginger-scented variety (tagline: ""May your sweetheart feel your love!""). He even has a powder for dogs. I saw a tweet about Poincheval’s new ginger pill a few weeks ago, and immediately fell down an internet rabbit hole. What I found at the end could’ve actually been a Lewis Carroll character. A portly, red-faced Frenchman with a huge white beard and a black bowler hat, who seemed like some sort of hippie Da Vinci; a compulsive inventor-artist-musician living in the rural hills of northwest France. Who makes fart pills. Poincheval markets his pills under the name Pilule Pet — a French play on words that basically translates to ""fart pill."" They’re the latest in a long line of attempts to conquer what may be the most enduring of biological taboos, and they go for the jugular. As Benjamin Franklin once wrote: ""Were it not for the odiously offensive smell accompanying such escapes, polite people would probably be under no more restraint in discharging such wind in company than they are in spitting or blowing their noses."" Pilule Pet promises to eradicate that unease, though I had my doubts. The website makes clear that the pills aren’t classified as drugs, and its clumsy design doesn’t exactly scream scientific credibility. Even the cheeky taglines and exaggerated photos make them seem more like prank stocking stuffers, if not snake oil. But the intrigue surrounding both the pills and their zany creator was enough for me to probe further. After a few emails and phone calls, I finally got in touch with Poincheval, and we agreed to meet outside the train station in Alençon, about 130 miles west of Paris. It was there that I found him sitting Buddha-like in an old hatchback on a brisk Wednesday morning. I waved hello, grabbed the door, and a rush of nervous excitement ran down my body. During the train ride from Paris, I had entertained visions of dosing with Poincheval in a chateau atop some pastoral landscape, drinking wine and farting Godiva over a fire. That never happened, because as I soon found out, it takes about a week for the Pilule Pet to take effect. But what I found instead was just as entertaining: a glimpse into the life and mind of an aging, tireless creator tucked away in a rural oasis, and unabashedly fascinated by everything around him.  Things aren’t as crazy nowadays. He and Évelyne still play the occasional gig together, but he’s retired (""in administrative terms"") and most of their time is spent at home — a small stone cottage nestled into a hillside along a one-lane road. I spotted it immediately, because it’s impossible to miss. Installed in the yard around it, and the lot directly across, are sinewy, sometimes creepy looking statues made of tin, plastic, and other garage floor materials, shooting out from otherwise empty green farmland. On the roof of an adjacent warehouse are installations that look like colorful, squiggly sperm. ""Yes, yes,"" Poincheval said as we pulled into the gravel driveway, letting out the first of many cackles. ""It’s another world in there."" His first order of business was the fire, and he executed it with surprising grace, gliding around the red tile floor with logs in his arms, and relentlessly poking them into flames. I soon realized that it’s nearly impossible for the man to sit still. As he danced from one topic to the next — art, economic inequality, Charlie Hebdo — he paced deliberately in front of the fireplace, hands buried in the pockets of his bright blue overalls. Poincheval's Inventions began with newspaper printed on toilet paper A similar restlessness seems to have driven Poincheval’s professional life, though it’s hard to say what that is with any precision. He spent a quarter century playing and recording music with Les Poinchevaux, but he’s also worked in education and the media, maintaining his own radio show and starting a free local newspaper, L’Aggressif. For decades, he’s been creating sculptures and other installations under the name ""Lutin Malin,"" which roughly translates as ""Clever Goblin."" When we met last week, he had just finished a 40-foot Santa Claus made of 16,000 plastic bottles for a local fair. The inventions began, quite literally, as an offshoot of his newspaper. In 1999, Poincheval created a line of toilet paper with news articles printed on each sheet, for which he won a medal at the Concours Lépine, France’s annual inventors’ competition. From there, he went on to create another kind of toilet paper that folds into small Kleenex-like packets, though he ventured into non-scatological areas, as well: a Swiss Army knife-like contraption for garden tools, and an eco-friendly coffee packaged in paper juice boxes. His creations have been met with varying levels of commercial success and media attention within France, but Poincheval says he’s never been motivated by money. His cottage is small and rustic, and his clothes are vibrant, but simple. As I spoke with him about his life, he seemed most proud not of his inventions or the awards they’ve won, but of the significant revenue they’ve brought in to local charities. A portion of his toilet paper sales, for instance, went to an organization that trains dogs to help handicapped people. To date, he’s financed training for 15 dogs. That’s not to say he doesn’t seek recognition (he does) or that he hasn’t gone to great lengths to commercialize his products (he has). But for him, the inventions are merely an extension of his art — a way to provoke thought, debate, and the occasional laughs. ""I’m convinced that everyone likes beauty — the rich, the poor, everyone,"" he said between pokes at the fire. ""The person who doesn’t love beauty doesn’t exist… To put it simply, everyone likes to come."" None of his inventions blur the line between art and product quite like the Pilule Pet. The fart pills were born, Poincheval says, after an especially heavy dinner with friends in 2004. The feast resulted in a chorus of particularly pungent flatulence, and that got his wheels turning. Already an avid practitioner of homeopathic remedies, he began researching ingredients and spent three months testing different formulas with the help of a French laboratory. They finally arrived on the perfect combination of vegetable carbon, fennel, and other natural ingredients, and set about bringing their rose and violet pills to market. ""I wanted to undress the shame you feel when you fart at the table.""  ""I wanted to undress the shame you feel when you fart at the table,"" Poincheval explained to me, ""the fear you feel that the fart may travel farther. I wanted to remove this complex, if you will."" That ""complex"" seems to be pretty well ingrained. Kirsten Bell, an anthropologist at the University of British Columbia, published a cursory and admittedly lighthearted blog post last year about the anthropology of farting. To her surprise, she found very few academic studies on why farts can be simultaneously embarrassing, hilarious, or taboo across different cultures, though historical anecdotes suggest that their stench has something to do with it. A report from the 17th century, for instance, describes Papua New Guineans who were so offended by the smell of Dutch sailors’ farts that they thought ""shame and contempt"" had been brought upon them. There may be other factors at play, Bell speculates, including sound and the perceived loss of control that accompanies every fart. But the idea of scentless, let alone perfumed flatulence raises compelling questions. ""I couldn’t tell if he was fully serious or if it was somewhat of a joke,"" Bell said after I sent her a link to Poincheval’s pill website. ""But I was really intrigued by it, because what would a fart mean if it didn’t smell bad?"" Poincheval and his business partners admit that their cheeky marketing campaign makes it hard for people to take the product seriously, but that’s also part of the strategy. ""If that was your reaction then we’re doing well,"" Léon Fazakerley, a Franco-South African entrepreneur and Poincheval’s business partner, later told me over the phone. ""I had the same reaction as you to start with, but from personal experience I can say it does work, and being a beer drinker myself, I don’t have the best of diets, maybe."" Fazakerley, 44, began working with Poincheval in 2007, when he helped him sell the toilet paper and the fart pills on eBay. At first, sales were moderate and limited only to France, where several major TV networks had covered them in reports. But business exploded late last year, after news of the chocolate pill was picked up by English-language media. During a 15-day period in December, they filled more than 2,000 orders — mostly to the US — and had to put the rest on back order for January. A lot of those are one-time buyers — likely for Christmas gifts or pranks — but there are repeat customers, as well, which Fazakerley points to as proof of their effectiveness. But others aren’t so sure. ""I have little doubt that the content of these tablets can produce a different gas profile,"" Anton Emmanuel, a consultant gastroenterologist at University College Hospital in London, said in a phone interview. ""The scientific question that remains is whether you can produce enough of that gas to make it smell different."" Emmanuel notes that there are existing treatments that have been shown to help neutralize gas odors in some patients, but he says the notion of creating perfumed farts is scientifically ""questionable,"" given the unique complexities of intestinal bacteria. ""It may help in some people, but it will be a very modest effect,"" he added, ""and the majority of the people won’t feel any difference at all."" Poincheval acknowledges that the effect of the pills depends on dosage and individual diets, but he also says they have a larger, more societal purpose. ""At their core, they provoke discussions, debate,"" Poincheval said, ""and try to liberate the fart, which is something totally natural."" Where Poincheval’s mind wanders next is anyone’s guess. As far as the pills go, Fazakerley is currently exploring exclusive distribution deals outside of France, while Poincheval begins thinking about the next scent — ""a pill for summer,"" is all he would say. He’s also interested in applying the same homeopathic approach to human feces, though he’s not one to keep to a tight schedule. ""I’m like a leaf,"" Poincheval said over lunch at what seemed like the only restaurant in town, removing his hands from their perch atop his belly and waving them leaf-like over what was once a pork roast and a full carafe of red wine. ""I just go where the wind leads."" After lunch, the as-yet unbroken wind led us back to his home, where the afternoon sun was streaming in through dusty windows. Poincheval picked up his guitar and began strumming a few folk songs as I collapsed into an ovular wicker chair. A few minutes later, Évelyne, his wife, returned home from giving a spoken-word poetry class to teenagers, as she does every week. She greeted me with warm eyes and a soft bonjour, her long gray hair pulled back behind her head. Then she took off her coat and started singing along with her husband, sliding in seamlessly and without hesitation — two aging, hippie lovers reunited at sundown in front of a fire that never seems to go out. A video posted by Amar Toor (@amartoor) on Feb 13, 2015 at 6:00am PST Poincheval’s inventions likely won’t change the world. They may not even change many farts. But he doesn’t seem to care much, because that's not really what drives him. It’s in the exploration, the incessant tinkering, that he finds happiness. Life without it, he says, would be unthinkable. ""When people say we’ve tried everything — that’s just not possible!"" he said. ""We’ll never have tried everything, because it’s just an eternal cycle where everything is reinvented every day. We’re all just mutants."" As I left to catch my train back to Paris, Poincheval handed me a jar of fart pills, along with some general instructions. I’ve been taking them for the past few days, and I’m still waiting for my chocolate.",0.6032017932167283,0.3967982067832717,0.8531764248416391,2106,5.0066476733143404,1062,6.422787193973635,0,16,Culture,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Though Samsung has ceased selling all of the devices in question — such as the Galaxy Tab and AT&T's Galaxy S II — Apple argues that a ban is still important for preventing Samsung from selling them again in the future. This time around, Apple will have a better chance at winning the injunction too. Though Apple won't be able to argue for a sales ban on the grounds of design patent infringement, it will have a lower bar to reach when arguing for an injunction over utility patents. Apple will now only have to show that Samsung's use of a patent it infringed on led to some demand for a device, rather than actually driving the device's sales as it did before. With none of the products currently on sale from Samsung — or particularly likely to go back on sale as they grow more outdated — the ruling likely won't have an immediate impact on consumers either way.

Handing down an unusually sweeping ruling, Judge William Pauley III ruled that the NSA's phone record database was fully lawful under section 215 of the Patriot Act. Beyond that, the judge ruled, ""the question of whether that program should be conducted is for the other two coordinate branches of Government to decide."" ""This blunt tool only works because it collects everything."" Judge Pauley opens the opinion with thoughts on the attacks of 9/11, which he describes as ""a bold jujitsu."" The opening paragraphs detail the case of 9/11 hijacker Khalid al-Mihdhar, who the NSA mistakenly believed was living in Yemen at the time of the attacks because of insufficient data collection. (This anecdote, based on General Alexander's congressional testimony, has been widely disputed.) The metadata collection program grew up in response to those intelligence failures, collecting more and more data so as to suss out the missed connections. Calling the program, ""a wide net that could find and islolate gossamer contacts,"" Pauley concludes, ""this blunt tool only works because it collects everything."" One key legal question centered on the status of the documents that revealed the NSA program, which were made public by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, but are still officially classified. For Pauley, that makes it difficult to build a case on them, or claim damages. ""Congress did not intend that targets of 215 orders would ever learn of them,"" the ruling reads. ""It cannot possibly be that lawbreaking conduct by an NSA contractor that reveals state secrets...could frustrate Congress's intent. To hold otherwise would spawn mischief."" As a result, he held the ACLU's claim must be dismissed. It's unclear where the case will go from here, but at least one path leads to the Supreme Court. In a similar case earlier this month, a separate federal court ruled the phone records program was ""likely unconstitutional."" That disagreement sets the stage for higher level adjudication, although the cases would have to first advance through the necessary appeals. ACLU deputy legal director Jameel Jaffer described the ruling as misguided. ""We are extremely disappointed with this decision, which misinterprets the relevant statutes, understates the privacy implications of the government’s surveillance and misapplies a narrow and outdated precedent to read away core constitutional protections,"" Jaffer said in a prepared statement.

Banned cyber weapons could still be used in self-defense In addition, the Pentagon must issue a report on how to strengthen ties with small businesses, making them more aware of threats and helping to create plans that protect networks and intellectual property. Building relationships between businesses and federal cyber operations groups has been an issue for the past couple of years, though the focus has generally been on larger information sharing agreements like CISPA.

As the FAA works to get drones integrated into US airspace, the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security will be looking into sharing expenses for testing and training; the Pentagon will also need to work towards milestones set on the FAA's roadmap for drones, laying out what technological progress has been made and what kind of resources are still needed. While the unmanned commercial craft we'll be seeing more of in the near future will be fairly small and low-flying, the Department of Homeland Security already uses Predator surveillance drones to patrol the border.  This week, the Defense Department also released its own planning document for unmanned warfare over the next 25 years. The Unmanned Systems Integrated Roadmap builds on a similar 2011 document, describing agency plans to modernize current unmanned craft and focus energy on developing a small number of new systems in the face of ""austere"" budgets. Modernization projects will focus on creating interoperable standards and swappable weapons, with more futuristic attack systems down the road. The report describes one of these as ""nanoenergetics,"" a field of study using tiny particles that, when combined, have a greater surface area than their larger counterparts, creating smaller more powerful explosives that could be put on light unmanned aircraft. The military must ""take the 'man' out of unmanned."" Remote-operated technology both on and off the ground has become a major part of military operations, but the Defense Department is still weighing the options around actual autonomous craft, which could cut out human error and reduce manpower needs but pose serious moral and technological questions. Many systems can already carry out individual, preprogrammed tasks autonomously, and experimental machines can even perform complex takeoffs and landings on aircraft carriers. But real autonomy will require adapting to changing situations and carrying out missions, not just programs, without human intervention. There's still a long way to go, but the report says that overall, the military must ""take the 'man' out of unmanned,"" cutting down the number of personnel required to operate systems through greater efficiency and automation. In the near- to mid-term, the military hopes to build on existing routines for somewhat more autonomous robots and air or ground craft, creating things like machine ""wingmen"" who can support humans in a mission. Beyond 2020, they hope research will move them towards fully autonomous systems, largely on the ground and in the water: the chart above calls for ""autonomous missions worldwide"" for unmanned maritime vehicles (which don't have to worry about bad flight conditions or complex terrain) by 2022. To some extent, autonomous systems will develop in tandem with their civilian counterparts; the report references self-driving car initiatives like those of Google. But specifically military applications will also raise the specter of surveillance or killing machines that operate outside human control, something that has caught the attention of ethicists and non-governmental organizations across the globe.",0.7491144273226576,0.25088557267734235,0.8731964503603572,703,5.5661450924608822,419,6.6420047732696901,0,0,"US & World, National Security",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

The site's founder Ryan J. has been searching out and organizing the shows for a good six years and now feels the collection is complete enough to put out there. Nearly everything is sourced from an audience recording, which means the audio quality isn't going to match that of a traditional, band-sourced live recording, but the upside is that fans can probably find any show they've attended over the years — or find some classic performances they may have missed. Each source is clearly labeled, graded, and includes audio samples so you know what you're getting into. Most files are in FLAC for the best quality, and the mastermind behind the project says he's actively looking to upgrade the shows that are only available in MP3.

He is enormous, glowing in flames, and way more detailed than any digitally made creature has a right to be on a screen this large. Watching the beginning of The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies very quickly reminds you why director Peter Jackson is so popular for what he does — making truly spectacular movies — but people seeing it in certain theaters are likely to be reminded of something else as well: playing a video game.  How can Peter Jackson and James Cameron seem so wrong? As with the past Hobbit films, The Battle of the Five Armies is being released in a limited number of theaters in a format called HFR, or high-frame rate. In this case, it means that the film was shot and is being projected at twice the frame rate that movies have been using for close to a century. It means a sharper, more detailed, and more lifelike image. But it also means a style that moviegoers aren't used to and have largely expressed displeasure with. Plainly: HFR movies can look a lot like soap operas or home videos, which is strange because both Peter Jackson and James Cameron, the director of Avatar, think they’re the future of cinema. So how can they both be so wrong? It's possible that they're not — they're just not selling it right. ""It's like watching a movie where the flicker and the strobing and the motion blur what we've been used to seeing all of our lives — I mean, all our lives in the cinema — suddenly that just disappears. It goes,"" Jackson told The Huffington Post back in 2012. ""And you've got this incredibly vivid, realistic-looking image."" A sharper image and reduced motion blur sound great, but they’re the least convincing arguments for HFR. Even the most casual moviegoer can tell that everything from acting to set design falls apart at different points in The Hobbit’s high-frame rate screenings (you can’t be swept away into a fantasy world when it looks like somebody shot Gandalf with a camcorder). Rather, what the technology is so obviously good for is computer-generated effects. Gamers are already well aware that more frames means smoother animations Video game players and developers are well aware that higher frame rates make animations look better. 30 frames per second is the baseline for quality, but 60 fps is the sweet spot that it seems everyone would ultimately like to hit. And that's around where HFR lands. It’s theoretically capable of fixing the stuttered look that you often see while watching 3D, and on a simpler level, it can allow for smoother animated effects. That’s why Jackson shot The Hobbit at 48 fps and why Cameron has talked about shooting his next three Avatar films at either 48 or 60 fps, if not more. (Until now, films have almost always been shown and shot at 24 fps.) For effects, the results are great. They still look like they come from a computer — a higher frame rate doesn't make them look any more real — but they do appear more detailed than ever. And that's why HFR might actually succeed.   So many of today's films rely on CG imagery — from small fixes to green-screened environments to entire characters. Whenever someone convinces Michael Bay to make another Transformers, you can bet it would be a lot easier to tell what’s happening during a hectic battle sequence thanks to those extra frames. The film also wouldn’t need to worry about HFR’s downsides as much, since computer-generated robots are the real stars. If you're wondering what this future will look like, just head to YouTube. It added 60 fps playback in October, and while that's not a big deal for most filmmakers, it has been a big deal for presenting clips of video games. Even if you aren't a gamer, it's easy to see how much smoother a 60 fps video can look than a standard one. And while we like to lament the overuse of computer-generated effects, CG spectacle is also what continues to draw people to theaters. If HFR can expand that, it can be a success. Avatar's virtual world is perfect for HFR That doesn't mean there won't be problems going forward. The only movies that filmmakers know how to make right now are ones shot at 24 frames per second. Everything from lighting techniques to camera movements will need to be rethought for the more naturalistic style of HFR, and while overcoming that is going to be difficult, it’s something that directors can manage — particularly if they’re making a film that exists in a computer-generated world. That’s where James Cameron comes in. Some of the most spectacular shots in the original Avatar aren't shots at all, but fully rendered CG environments. Even when there are real actors on screen, there's usually an artificial world wrapped around them, and when Cameron switches to HFR for the next Avatar movies, you can expect more immersive environments. In fact, just about all of Pandora’s flora and fauna, mountains and oceans should be looking crisper, cleaner, and more detailed. Cameron's films may just be the ones to prove that HFR can work. Cameron also has the advantage of going after Jackson, who may have dived into the pool a bit too soon. Demos Cameron put together a few years ago revealed that faster frame rates, particularly 60 fps or above, are less jarring than the 48 fps that Jackson decided on. It’s possible that Jackson’s chosen frame rate exists in an uncanny valley of sorts for filmmaking — more realistic, but in all the creepy wrong ways. Cameron has also suggested that Avatar’s sequels could change frame rate from scene to scene, which might even be the best scenario possible: live-action shots could be filmed traditionally, while heavy effects shots could use the added clarity of a higher frame rate. After some awful first experiences, Cameron helped convince audiences that 3D was viable with the first Avatar. If viewers like Pandora in 2016 as much as they used to, HFR might be in for the same kind of victory.",0.5213571874191646,0.4786428125808354,0.16849180911680908,1052,4.7642585551330798,526,5.9125475285171101,0,0,"Culture, Entertainment, Photography",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

The world’s first blockbuster podcast, Serial, released its final episode yesterday. You can be forgiven for missing it, because not a lot of people were talking about it. That’s because its long-speculated dramatic conclusion ended up lacking in both drama and conclusion. Its thoroughly unsatisfying denouement highlighted everything I have come to dislike about this show, which I feel is a failure as both a journalistic enterprise and true crime narrative. Serial follows a time honored narrative tradition A lot of ink has been spilled discussing why Serial caught on with such a huge audience. Partly it was piggybacking on the success of This American Life. It also comes at a time when podcasts are seeing a renaissance as an artform. But the simplest answer is that crime stories, and especially serialized crime stories, are a perennial draw. Charles Dickens and Arthur Conan Doyle built literary empires with this approach. And of course, there’s Law and Order, one of the longest running and most successful TV franchises of all time. The key on Law and Order is to depict real cases, but to do so with a veneer of fiction, so that you’re not subjecting the actual criminals and victims, alleged or otherwise, to the moralizing necessities of a plot. Its stories are ""ripped from the headlines"" but tied up with a neat little bow. In the real world, the evidence doesn’t always add up, the cops don’t catch the right guy, and prosecutors don’t bother to get indictments when the evidence seems overwhelmingly compelling. On Law and Order you can fix all that. I binged on the first seven episodes of Serial over a two-day period and thoroughly enjoyed them. It was a true crime cold case, but it seemed like Sarah Koenig, the central journalist and narrator of the story, was uncovering new evidence, moving us closer to answering that critical question. Was Adnan Syed, the man serving a life sentence for the murder of his ex-girlfriend Hae Min Lee, guilty or innocent? If the series had wrapped up around episode eight, with the conclusion that our justice system is deeply flawed, I would have rated it highly. But as things dragged on, it increasingly felt like the investigation was going in circles, and the question of the main character’s innocence was hinging on ever more trivial details. By episode 11, I was officially hate-listening. In that episode, Koenig began dissecting an incident from Syed's adolescence in which he stole some money from the donation box at his mosque. She was moving beyond combing minor details to trafficking in rumors that had no bearing on the murder case. Koenig spent time on rumors that had no bearing on the murder case Syed, by this point, was clearly sick of the show as well. He demanded to know why she was humiliating him in front of millions of listeners with questions about petty crimes he committed as a teenager. Koenig doesn’t make any excuses for her behavior, but she doesn’t stop either. Instead she trotted out anonymous sources who performed various feats of character assassination with her blessing. The final episode does its best to offer some kind of resolution. Koenig says she can’t know for sure if Adnan is guilty or not, but that having looked at all the evidence, she is certain that he should not have been convicted, that the case was too thin to clear the hurdle of reasonable doubt. And yet just minutes earlier her fellow producer had declared Adnan is either guilty or the unluckiest man alive, running down a list of all the coincidences that would’ve had to happen for his story to hold up. When you cast people as characters, you owe them great restraint In graduate school I was assigned to read Janet Malcolm’s seminal work, The Journalist and the Murderer. Its most famous line neatly encapsulates everything that I find so frustrating with Serial. ""Every journalist who is not too stupid or too full of himself to notice what is going on knows that what he does is morally indefensible."" Put another way, when you make a real person the main character in your plot and create narrative around them, you need to be aware that it’s often an abusive and humiliating experience for them. I’m not saying that reporters shouldn’t pursue true crime stories. There is room in the world for a more serious treatment of crime than Law and Order. Serial could have been a fascinating examination of our justice system, through the stories of the characters involved in this one cold case. But, for me at least, Koenig lost sight of Malcolm's essential maxim and dragged the drama on beyond what the the facts of the story could support.",0.4551731343502424,0.5448268656497576,0.14114456678991302,824,4.8737864077669899,459,6.0915032679738559,0,0,"Culture, Entertainment",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Microsoft has already launched this feature elsewhere in the world, but Xbox customers in North America have been clamoring for their turn; the company says OTA support has been a top request among users. This plus Sling TV could make for a great setup You'll need more than an Xbox One console to watch live TV, however. Both a TV tuner (Microsoft recommends this one) and an HDTV antenna are required before you can receive OTA channels. In the future, Microsoft says we'll see a lower-cost Hauppauge TV tuner specifically designed for the Xbox One priced at $59.99. One end of the tuner plugs into a coaxial connection that pulls in the TV signal, and the other connects to your Xbox One over USB. The company is being careful to note that interested customers should research exactly what channels — if any — are available at their home address. OTA reception can vary dramatically depending on local terrain, so Microsoft wants you to go here to see what's available. There's nothing worse than going out and buying an antenna only to discover that you can't even watch anything. Preview program members can start watching live TV right now Once it's set up, the Xbox One will automatically fill out guide listings for your local channels, and you'll be able to quickly switch between live TV and Xbox games — or do both things simultaneously with the console's Snap feature. Xbox One also lets you pause live channels (with a buffer that lasts up to 30 minutes) and reserves around 4GB of hard drive space for that function. It's not a proper DVR, but it's better than nothing. You can also stream those same channels through the Xbox One SmartGlass app if someone else is using the TV. Pair this new Xbox One OTA support with something like Sling TV, and you get a pretty decent selection of TV programming for only $15 per month. Microsoft says OTA support is coming first to its Xbox preview program members; it's available right now if you've got the necessary hardware.

Those other two smartwatch platforms are the right ones to compare it to; there may be other smartwatches, but there really aren't other smartwatch ecosystems. Those are the three you have to choose from. Read next: Read our Apple Watch review. Actually, you have fewer than three to choose from. If you're using an iPhone, you can pick between the Apple Watch and Pebble — Android Wear won't work for you (for the time being, anyway). Same with Android: you either pick Android Wear or Pebble. There's no way that Apple is going to make it simple to use the Apple Watch with an Android phone. Battery life could be your real deciding factor So basically, unless you're interested in the Pebble, a comparison isn't going to help you with a purchasing decision between Apple and Android. Once you've picked your phone platform, you have a simple choice: would you rather have a full-featured smartwatch with a touchscreen that lasts about a day, or a simpler one that lasts nearly a week? If you want the simpler one (and don't mind how it looks), get the Pebble. If you want the fancier one, get the fancier one. But that simple choice belies a surprising amount of complexity and difference between these three platforms. It also doesn't tell you much about where each is going — so let's break it down, if only because it's fascinating to see how all three companies approached the question of what a smartwatch is supposed to be and how it's supposed to fit into your life.   Apple Watch: Starts at $349 for Apple Watch Sport with aluminum chassis and glass display. Regular Apple Watch starts at $549 with stainless steel design and sapphire display that better protects against scratches. The version we reviewed came in at around $700. Apple Watch Edition starts at $10,000 and soars up to $17,000. Note that no matter how much you spend, the basic specs stay the same. Android Wear: Smartwatches running Android Wear typically range between $200 (Asus ZenWatch) and $300 (steel Moto 360 / LG G Watch R). Pebble: The original Pebble remains available for just $99.99, with the Pebble Steel variant priced at $199.99. The upcoming Pebble Time is priced at $199, and the company will repeat its strategy of selling a more premium Steel model for a higher cost of $299.   Apple Watch: Apple's first smartwatch runs Watch OS, with a clean, streamlined design that includes a typeface designed by Apple itself. Watch OS works alongside iOS on your phone to deliver notifications and receive text messages and phone calls. An iPhone is required to use most functions of Apple Watch. There is a lot to say about how the Apple Watch works, you really should read our full review. Android Wear: Google's smartwatch platform runs a version of the Android operating system that's been tailored for your wrist, with an enormous focus on Google Now and surfacing information precisely where and when it's needed. Pebble: Seeing the competition move ahead in recent years, Pebble has revamped its software for the new Pebble Time watch — but it's not out yet. Visually, it's still not as sophisticated as what you'll find on Apple Watch or Android Wear — but crucially, Pebble's is the only smartwatch platform of the main three that works with both iPhone and Android smartphones.   Apple Watch: Apple offers by far the most customization options for a single smartwatch. Three models of Apple Watch exist, and they each come in two different sizes. From there, Apple also lets consumers choose between several wrist bands that can change up the device's style (and also dramatically impact price). Whereas Android Wear watches come in both square and round styles, Apple Watch offers no circular option. Android Wear: Thanks to its ecosystem of manufacturers, Android Wear offers a wide variety of hardware designs, though you're generally on your own when it comes to replacing the strap. Motorola offers the widest array of aftermarket wrist bands, though it's easy enough to swap out those on other Android Wear watches. Pebble: Pebble Time is thinner and lighter than the company's older smartwatches, and upgrades the previous black-and-white display to a nicer color screen. It's coming soon. The existing models aren't very beautiful, but they are at least functional.   Apple Watch: Since the screen is often turned off while you're wearing it, Apple Watch can last through a typical day of usage without any problems, but users will absolutely need to charge it nightly. Android Wear: For most Android Wear smartwatches, the same holds true. They'll comfortably make it through a day — and software updates have allowed devices like the Moto 360 to go longer. And it's getting better, with watches like the G Watch R able to last an entire day with the screen on. But you should still expect to be charging an Android Wear smartwatch frequently. Pebble: Longevity is the main advantage of Pebble's smartwatches. They can last for days on end, requiring a charge once per week. And Pebble does all that while keeping the screen on. Pebble has vowed that despite the inclusion of a color screen, the upcoming Pebble Time will maintain the company's reputation for leading battery life.   Apple Watch: Apple has made health and fitness a central part of the Apple Watch's purpose. The device can monitor your heart rate, daily workouts, and offer reminders when you've been inactive for too long during the day. Fitness data is synced with an Activity app that appears on your iPhone when Apple Watch is paired and connected. Android Wear: Beyond tracking your steps taken each day, many existing Android Wear watches also include a heart rate sensor. Android Wear feeds your health data into Google Fit, a central hub that can also pull in information from third-party fitness trackers or your Android smartphone. Pebble: Pebble puts less of a focus on fitness than its smartwatch rivals. You'll find a step counter among the watch's features, but that's about it for what comes by default. You can extend its fitness tracking capabilities some by downloading third-party apps, but it's still fairly limited compared to the scope of what Android Wear and Apple Watch offer out of the box.   Apple Watch: Apple's smartwatch can display any notification that would normally appear on your iPhone, but developers also have the option of tapping into the Watch's software and showing notifications that can be acted upon from your wrist, rather than require you pull out your phone to respond. Android Wear: Android Wear works similarly; it can mirror the notifications on your Android Wear, but developers who support the platform can enable users to do more (like responding to messages with voice dictation, or checking into a flight Pebble: Since it's not as deeply tied into iOS or Android, Pebble is somewhat limited in the notifications it can provide. But it checks off all the basics and can make sure you never miss any alert on your phone.   Apple Watch: To use third-party apps (or most apps, really) on Apple Watch, the device must be connected to your iPhone. Apple makes it easier than Android Wear to browse through the apps on your watch, however; just press the digital crown and you'll see everything on one, swipeable screen. Android Wear: Plenty of developers have added Android Wear support to their smartphone apps, offering functionality that extends beyond mere notifications. You can hail a Lyft ride, make Amazon purchases, or add items to your Wunderlist to-do list from your wrist. Pebble: Pebble will continue offering a slew of third-party apps through its own store, though the company hasn't yet brought on some of the bigger apps you'll find on Android Wear — and soon Apple Watch.   Apple Watch: Users can customize the watch faces that come included with Apple Watch to show upcoming appointments, alarms, the current weather, or other relevant information. The layout and colors used in some watch faces can also be adjusted — but Apple Watch does not yet offer the option of downloading new watch faces, nor can developers create them. Android Wear: New watch faces can be downloaded from Google Play, making Android Wear's personalization options pretty limitless. Pebble: Like Android Wear, Pebble gives users full freedom to download and install watch faces they like from the Pebble store.   Apple Watch: Yes, the Apple Watch features a touchscreen with full support for swiping gestures. Android Wear: Yes, Android Wear smartwatches include touchscreens. Pebble: No, Pebble's lineup of smartwatches do not yet include touchscreens; you interact with them by using physical buttons on the watch's side.

There are already over 1,000 Watch apps waiting for Apple's approval, but the ones that hit iTunes two weeks from now aren't going to be the most exciting. For now, Watch apps are just basic containers of information being beamed from a nearby iPhone to an Apple Watch. The real Watch apps — the ones that may truly make you want an Apple Watch — are likely still months and months away. Read next: Read our Apple Watch review. But even with what's available today, it's clear where the Apple Watch is headed. The apps that Apple has lined up for the Watch's launch define a very clear future for where the Watch — and its app ecosystem — are going. Here's what that looks like based on six of the most important apps already out there.     You don't need to do a lot with Uber's iPhone app. You put in your credit card info, let it access your location, and that's about it. From then on, all you need to do is press a button to hail a cab. For Uber, a Watch app offers a quicker way for people to get to that button. That doesn't sound like much, but that simplification is quite possibly what will make smartwatch apps work — and work well. Not just for Uber, but for any app that's based around simple, quick interactions or can implement something like them. Seamless is going to be a hazard if it launches one-tap reordering of your favorite meals. Winning an auction will be much easier if eBay gives a one-tap option to raise your bid. This is the exact same model that Amazon is tapping into with its instant-order Dash buttons — if something's easier, you'll probably do a lot more of it. Uber may be the best example of this interaction model on the Apple Watch right now, but it's not perfect. In fact, it's quickly apparent that being no more than a button is actually too simple. Want to select what type of car you're hailing? You're out of luck. Want to see what location Uber's going to pick you up in? Better hope that your phone's GPS is working properly. Putting the hail button right in front of you — after you wait for the app to load and detect your location — is a great way to interact with Uber on the Watch. Uber and other apps like it just needs to figure out an equally simple way to let you go two steps further.   Dark Sky is basically the corollary to Uber. The app isn't even a button — it's just a couple numbers that you want to see. But here's the key difference: you want to see Dark Sky's information regularly and have it pop up when it's important. The Apple Watch is arguably a better way to do that than the iPhone, which still makes you pull down a notification tray or open up Dark Sky's app. That doesn't totally change on the Apple Watch: if you want to see Dark Sky, you still have to pull up the Glances screen and swipe over to it (and, like all Glances, wait for it to load). This isn't much better than swiping to the notification screen on your iPhone, though it is a bit more informative. Where the app does shine right now is in notifications. On the iPhone, Dark Sky sends you a brief text update every now and then warning you if it's going to rain, how hard, and for how long. On the Apple Watch, Dark Sky will actually send you a chart of what to expect. It's the type of detailed information that makes you pay attention to what the app is saying — it answers your next question (""When is it going to rain?"") without making you open up the app. It's these glanceable basics that really stand out on the Apple Watch. The New York Times has already made an app that shows off headlines, and chances are we'll see a lot of other apps playing to this type of interaction.     Health is supposed to be huge on the Apple Watch. That's not true yet — in fact, third-party apps can't even access its heart-rate sensor! — but it's no secret that Apple has big ambitions here. And, chances are, third-party apps will play as big of a role in that as Apple. Nike+ Running is launching alongside the Watch as a fairly fully featured app, offering run distance, pace, location, and history. The trouble is, the data is all coming from your iPhone right now. We haven't been able to try Nike+ out just yet, but it still appears to be a great example of what type of information we want to see and see quickly from a workout app. Again, this is very much a start that doesn't make use of the Watch's hardware, but it's a sign of developers already responding in a robust way to Apple's grander plans for health.     You probably don't need to be able to buy movie tickets on your watch, but Fandango's Watch app does handle one thing that you will want: getting your ticket. This is something that it's been able to do using Passbook on the iPhone for years now, but the Watch app is intended to make that one step easier. Your ticket should just be ready when you need it — without having to pull out your phone. That's only a small benefit, but it's something that you're likely to see in conjunction with Passbook across a lot of other apps. Tickets, loyalty cards, and payment options should start being even more accessible when you need them. Apple Pay is already one of the Watch's strongest features. It's still limited to payments, but as it grows and the platform matures, expect features like this to become even more prevalent across the Watch's OS and its biggest apps.     As you'd expect, many of the biggest social networks are ready with Watch apps on day one. Of those, Twitter's short-form updates seem to make the most sense for the Apple Watch — but it isn't Twitter's app itself that really stands out here. Rather, it's that Twitter is one of the social networks that soared thanks to the rise of smartphones. The Watch may not change that, but there's a chance that we'll see new networks build around it, the same way that Twitter, Snapchat, and Tinder have all built up around the smartphone. At first, we're going to see a lot of social networks that grew up on other platforms doing their best to adapt to the Watch, lest they miss an important new platform (just ask Facebook how it feels about mobile). Twitter's approach is to heavily streamline what it offers: from the main screen, you can look at your timeline or you can look at current trends, and that's it. That's a big change for Twitter, which typically offers more views than it even knows what to do with. It's probably still too much for Twitter — looking through your timeline is often a lengthy task — but it's a start that shows Twitter honing in on simpler information. You can't check every tweet on your Watch, but you can at least see what's popular. If smartphones are any indication, it could be a few years before we see any lasting network pop up for the Apple Watch. For now, at least you'll stop missing DMs.     Honeywell may not have the brand cachet with early adopters that Nest does, but its Watch app is a perfect example of how Apple is moving into the home. If you have one of Honeywell's connected thermostats, you'll be able to change the temperature in your home just by tapping up or down in the app on your Watch. That is certainly a simple interaction that you could handle with a phone, but you're going to see a lot more of this very soon. Products supporting Apple's HomeKit are on the way, and the Internet of Things was the hot topic of this year's CES. The Apple Watch will increasingly be able to control parts of your house — chances are, we aren't so far away from being able to tap specific scene settings as you arrive back home. Beyond that, it sounds like Apple intends for the Watch eventually to be able to unlock your car, potentially making the Watch a key way for controlling things around you. Apple's done a great job of getting all of the high-profile names you can ask for on board with its watch for launch day. The interesting part is where it goes from here. What we're looking at are the most basic versions of Apple Watch apps that you can ask for. In a lot of the cases, the apps being shown off don't even seem particularly well designed. In other cases, you have to wonder why you'd want to use that given app on a watch. And in basically all cases, the apps take too long to load. But core concepts for Apple Watch apps are already out there and in use — now, it's just a matter of waiting for more apps to make good use of them.

Apple hasn't approved the app through the App Store, but Popcorn Time has found a way to sneak onto the two devices anyway. It's built an installer that you run on Windows (an OS X version is supposed to arrive in about two weeks), and it'll quickly load the app onto a connected phone or tablet. Notably, a device doesn't have to be jailbroken in order to install this version of Popcorn Time, which makes this app far more accessible than the one Popcorn Time has already been offering.  Apple hasn't approved the app, but you can still install it We were able to get the app installed and running fairly easily. On the iPad, Popcorn Time looks almost identical to its app on the desktop. It presents you with a big grid of movie posters, and tapping on one will give you more information and the option to start watching it. Pressing play means that you'll begin downloading a torrent in the background, pirating the film as you watch it. The app builds in a VPN to help hide users' identities, though it'll likely result in slowed downloads, too. Like its desktop app, the goal of Popcorn Time for iOS is to make illegally downloading movies as easy as watching something on Netflix — and that's something that the movie industry and Netflix itself have reason to fear. Apple has long maintained control over what apps can run on its platform, and it's been able to squash apps that slip through in the past. That means it's quite possible that Popcorn Time's easy iOS installer won't be around for long — but it's also possible that it'll just find another way through in the future. It's also worth remembering that, because this app hasn't been run through Apple, you're letting an app that hasn't been checked over for security issues access to your computer and iPad. The installer can be downloaded from Popcorn Time's website. Popcorn Time is also using today's release to celebrate its one year anniversary.

The sleek, white aircraft were ready to fly right out of the box, simple enough for beginners, but powerful enough for pros. They have appeared everywhere, from South Park to the White House lawn. And they are the driving force behind DJI's rapid revenue growth, turning it from a scrappy startup to a billion-dollar global giant. Today, at press event held in simultaneously in New York, London, and Munich, DJI unveiled the newest model, the Phantom 3. And thanks to an integration with YouTube, you can now stream live video footage from your drone to the internet.     There will be two models of the Phantom 3 — Professional and Advanced — with a suggested retail price of $1,250 and $999. DJI says both will start shipping in a few weeks. There isn't much of visual update here. The colored bands and name plate on the unit's white shell have changed from red to gold, but the body is largely the same. There are several critical updates to the hardware and software, however, that make this Phantom a whole new animal. DJI has added a downward-facing camera to give the craft a visual positioning system. That lets the Phantom 3 hold its position without a GPS signal, a big plus when flying indoors. The Phantom 3's positioning system has also been updated to work with GLONASS, a Russian, satellite-based navigation system that works in parallel to GPS. Combining both those systems allows the Phantom 3 to more quickly and reliably find a satellite signal, and to more precisely understand its location. The Phantom 3 also comes bundled with DJI's Lightbridge system. Previously this was a $1,400 add-on that required a cumbersome installation. Now that technology is built into the aircraft, allowing it to stream a live HD video feed from up to 2 kilometers away. This integration also allows the pilot to capture the video recording at his location, so you can still have your footage if you fly into a volcano and your drone doesn't make it out.            The Phantom Professional gets a 4K camera while the Advanced gets a 1080p HD. Both can capture 12 megapixel still photos. Compared to the camera on the DJI Phantom Vision 2+, this new unit has a larger sensor (1/2.3"") and a flatter field of view (94 degrees). The Phantom 2 Vision+ shot 1080i at 60fps, but not 1080p at 60fps like this new model. DJI is also giving its app for iOS and Android an upgrade. The Phantom 3 will now work with the Pilot app the company released alongside its Inspire One model. Importantly, that means the app will now feature a flight simulator mode, something I've been hoping for ever since I crashed my last Phantom. Finding a safe place to practice isn't always easy when you live in a crowded city like New York, especially if you're hoping to try out more complex maneuvers. Training on a flight simulator might have helped me avoid my accident, and perhaps kept that civil servant from having to explain his drunken crash to the Secret Service. Finally, in a move that fits the current trend among mobile apps, DJI has built live-streaming capabilities into the new Phantom. ""Pilots, whether they are journalists, extreme athletes, or global travelers — will not just be able to   share aerial videos of where they were, but will also be able to send a YouTube link to their friends   and colleagues to show them the aerial perspectives of where they are right now,"" said DJI’s San Francisco General Manager Eric Cheng. ""This has tremendous potential for changing the way we   share experiences with one another.""

That led his team to look for more. They now estimate 50 percent of the website's 500,000 workers have been linked to public Amazon user profiles, and about 30 percent list workers' first and last names. Yet when they surveyed the workers, researchers found 80 percent of a group of 1,000 were unsure of or didn't think job posters had access to their real names, and that 95 percent ""placed relatively high value on the security of their first and last name.""

American public school students in science classes of the near-future should be taught that human activity is leading to global warming by the end of eighth grade, that DNA supports the theory of evolution by the end of high school, and that human beings can engineer cleaner energy sources and more abundant food and water supplies, according to a new national education plan for kindergarten through high school, due to be released by the end of March.  Not all states will adopt the plan The plan, called Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS), is being finalized right now by a crack team of 41 experts from around the country, made up of science teachers, school officials and even a researcher at the DuPont chemical company. It's completely voluntary and up to each state's of board of education to adopt the final plan, and 26 states have been helping craft it over the past two years. But not all of them may end up adopting NGSS, and many outside of the group helping to write it almost certainly won't. Already, the Texas Education Agency has declared it won't be using NGSS to guide what is taught in its public schools, whatever the final version contains. But the reasons Texas is abstaining, and why many other states may join it in holding out, are far more complicated than just the fact that the final plan is set to include hot-button, politically charged issues like climate change, evolution and geoengineering. After all, many schools across the country already teach these topics. The NGSS is just the first time they are being suggested, and seriously considered, on the national scale. ""They're suspicious of any national educational effort, and education is a states' rights issue."" ""No matter what NGSS contained, Texas wouldn't adopt them,"" said Helen Quinn, chairman of a committee at the National Academy of Sciences that drafted the initial document guiding the team that's writing the new standards, in a phone interview with The Verge. ""They're suspicious of any national educational effort, and education is a states' rights issue."" It's important here to point out that Texas isn't disagreeing because the new standards come from the federal government or the White House. ""There was no conversation with the federal Department of Education in developing the framework,"" Quinn said. In fact, the process to create the new standards has come entirely from a collection of nonprofit groups, one massive private corporation, and a little over half of the states in the US. ""There was no conversation with the federal Department of Education in developing the framework."" Quinn's organization, the National Academy of Sciences, got the ball rolling on the new standards back in the summer of 2011. The nonprofit association of scientists oversees a division called the National Research Council, which received funding from the Carnegie Corporation of New York to work on creating a broad template for what the country's science classes should be teaching, including the content of lessons and the methods of teaching students, to ensure America's kids learn enough to keep pace with the globalized, increasingly technologically intertwined world. ""We basically brought out one big narrative, the 30,000-foot perspective,"" said Martin Storksdieck, director of the board on national science education at the US National Academies, the umbrella organization that includes Quinn's group. The resulting document, ""A Framework for K-12 Science Education,""  was first published almost two years ago. From there, the framework was passed to another nonprofit educational group called Achieve, which called upon 41 experts from 26 states to figure out the nitty gritty of how exactly how science teachers in public can adopt the new approach in their classrooms in the most expeditious but least disruptive fashion possible. 41 experts from 26 states That will be easier said than done. Many science classes in the nation's nearly 100,000 public K-12 schools have up until now focused their classes around just three broad fields: biology, physics and chemistry. In each of these, students are often taught lists of facts and major theories, and not necessarily the scientific principles behind them. So the Achieve team has spent the past two years working on the final NGSS document, including trying to integrate public comment and criticism. In the end, their final plan will stick to the broad outlines made by the framework, which includes engineering, technology, and earth and space sciences.  ""Within NGSS, climate change is actually a tiny part of the overall new picture of Earth as a system,"" said Ramon Lopez, a physics professor at the University of Texas in Arlington, who's one of the 41-member writing team currently scrambling to finish the standards by the self-imposed, end-of-March deadline. ""That's actually the bigger change. For example, in high school, students are expected to learn there's variation on the Sun and that impacts us here on Earth."" Lopez and Kevin Fisher of the Lewisville Independent School District, another Texas-residing member of the 41-member NGSS writing squad, both said they weren't too concerned that their populous state and its 4.8 million public school students won't actually be covered by their plan. ""I do not see this as causing any type of divide."" ""Even if a state does not adopt the NGSS, the NGSS and the framework document will still provide valuable resources to that state,"" Fisher wrote to The Verge in an email. ""It will help states to focus on the 'big ideas' in science, be able to effectively integrate the science and engineering practices, and connect the various science disciplines through the cross-cutting concepts.  I do not see this as causing any type of divide."" Not everyone who was involved in the development process behind NGSS is as sanguine about the prospect that some states are sure to opt-out entirely. ""If a state in its ultimate wisdom decides to disadvantage its children and advantage other children elsewhere, that's democracy,"" said Storksdieck. Indeed, even in the states that do end up adopting the new standards, in the end, it's up to local school districts and local teachers to implement them on a practical, day-to-day level. That process alone could take three to four years just to get started, and realistically, twelve years to get NGSS working in all grades kindergarten through high school. And as Storksdieck and everyone else who The Verge spoke with about the issue acknowledges, the unique culture of a local community and its parents will go a long way toward determining just how and what public school students learn. So even the backers of NGSS are keeping their expectations in check. Local communities will ultimately decide what students learn ""The hope is that this provides students and learners tools they can use in their lives,"" Quinn said. ""At the least, they'll be able to ask themselves 'is this information coming from a scientific perspective or another perspective that's not scientific?' Not that another perspective isn't important. There are certain things science tells us nothing about, what makes a good poem, for example.""

Later that day, SpaceX founder Elon Musk showed off footage of the 262.8-foot-high launch during his keynote at the South by Southwest Interactive Festival in Austin, saying ""If we’re going to be a multiplanet species, we must have reusable rockets.""

To this end, SpaceX has been testing the Grasshopper with successively higher launches in Texas since September 2012. Musk and company haven't yet shared a definitive timeline on when they could actually use Grasshopper for spaceflight, but it's clearly getting a little bit closer with every hop.

Over the past 30 years, trees and tall shrubs that commonly grow in the temperate parts of the world have been observed spreading 250 to 430 miles further north, according to a new study by a team of NASA researchers and international scientists. Also, not surprisingly, the researchers project that the change in Arctic flora is going to get much more pronounced as the level of greenhouse gases increases in the coming years.  The study looked at NASA and NOAA satellite imagery of vegetation in the Arctic, focusing on the area above the 50 degree latitude mark, right above Seattle, Washington. From data gathered between 1982 and 2011, researchers determined that the difference between winter and summer temperatures in this region has diminished over the past three decades. As a result, plants from four to six degrees of latitude south of  where the researchers were looking were found in this area. Also, of the 10 million-square miles where plants grow in the Arctic, 34 to 41 percent saw increased growth during the period the study covered (green and blue marks in the following graphic). Another 51 to 62 percent of the area showed no changes in growth patterns, yet (yellow), while just 3 to 5 percent of the area studied lost vegetation (orange and red).   Under one scenario, the temperature variation of Seattle would be more like Texas The researchers also looked at 17 different climate change models to project what would could happen in the area going forward, and found that by the year 2100, the Arctic's temperature variation between summer and winter would continue to diminish, making the area studied similar to the area 20 degrees of latitude south. That would mean Seattle's temperature variation would be more like that of Texas. The researchers are still unsure exactly how such a dramatic temperature change could impact the vegetation overall, and advocate for continued monitoring to keep close track.

I wouldn't have said that we needed a song about how great the internet is, but now I'm sure that we do.

But I'm optimistic that, with the internet's help, they'll be able to fill me in on that. It's true! At least, I try to. Right now (with these very words), I'm representing my own nation to other nations, just as China is representing itself to me. We're all participating in a vast and continuous cultural exchange, carried over ropes of glass buried deep within the mother ocean.

It's hard on everyone: painful for the victim and heartbreaking for those around them. Nobody wants to see someone they care about fade away in an endless, degrading, excruciating fashion. That's exactly what's happening with Sonic the Hedgehog, who continues to star in video games despite the fact that they're all awful and nobody cares. Sega is being cruel. Sonic needs to die. The Sonic series is currently at its creative and financial nadir, and that's saying something. Sonic Boom: Rise of Lyric and Sonic Boom: Shattered Crystal, which launched late last year on the Wii U and 3DS, are now the worst-selling major Sonic releases ever. Across several months and two platforms, the games sold less than 500,000 copies. Rise of Lyric currently has a score of 32 on Metacritic. The 3DS version is so bad that Sonic fans have taken to giving the game 10 out of 10 user reviews, in an attempt to outweigh all the negative critical feedback. ""It's just flawless,"" says one review. ""That's all I have to say."" He was the reason to own a Sega Genesis Those fans are deeply attached to the series for a reason. While there hasn't been an excellent Sonic game in at least a decade — racing games don't count — Sonic helped define the 16-bit era of video games. He was the reason to own a Sega Genesis. He was the antithesis of Mario: fast, cocky, and exciting. He had an actual personality. If you put down the controller for too long he would start tapping his foot, wondering when he'd finally get to start running again. Those original Sonic games may not hold up as well as Nintendo's classics, but Sonic's earliest adventures were some of the most important video games ever made, in part because they provided Nintendo with respectable competition. I'm not crazy enough to think the Genesis was a better console than the SNES, but watching commercials of Sonic blazing through the Green Hill Zone as a kid definitely made me jealous.   Fast forward to today, and it's hard to even care about a new Sonic release. He had a few moments after the Genesis era — the Sonic Adventure series for the ill-fated Dreamcast was great, and a trilogy of Game Boy Advance games proved that the formula still had merit. But things have only gotten worse since then. There have been spin-offs and reboots, big-budget console games and small mobile releases, but none have managed to capture the essence of what made the early games so charming. The new Sonic games feel more like those terrible movie tie-ins, shallow cash-ins on a name more than anything else. The best thing Sonic has done in recent years is a brief cameo in Wreck-it Ralph. Sonic has been dying for a long time People like to deride Nintendo for relying heavily on its big-name franchises. When a new Nintendo console comes out, you know you'll be playing Super Mario and The Legend of Zelda before long. But unlike Sega, Nintendo gets away with returning to the same well because it still treats its franchises with respect: the most recent Mario game is up there with the best, and the Wii U version of Zelda has me more excited than just about any other game this year. Sega, meanwhile, once made a Sonic spin-off where the characters had guns. Sonic's long, slow, sad decline is akin to a great athlete that just doesn't know when to retire. It's hard to remember how great he once was when so much time has passed, and I have a hard time imagining what could be done to make the Sonic name relevant again. Unlike Mario, Sonic is a product of his time, a quintessentially '90s personality that just hasn't been able to figure out his place in the modern world. I don't think he ever will. He also still exists in other formats, including a cartoon series and some comics (fittingly, published by Archie Comics, another vestige of a time long gone), but really, we need to end it all. Maybe once enough time has passed, and we've all grieved for him, we can consider the notion of a reboot. Sonic has been dying for a long time.

What's Tech invites experts to explain the technology bit by bit, in clear, brief, enjoyable audio nuggets. These days, technology is everywhere. Let's make sense of what's around us. Each episode is about 15-20 minutes long and explains a specific corner of technology. Snapchat, net neutrality, and Tinder are just some of the early topics. We're premiering with two episodes. For the first episode, my pal, The Verge's Business Editor Ben Popper, told me about drones and how he almost killed a woman and a child. In the second episode, Senior Editor Dan Seifert gets kicked out of an Applebee's, and also explains the rising popularity of the smartwatch. Yes, I'm serious. No, nobody got hurt. Yes, I would love for you to subscribe. Here's a link to the What's Tech? iTunes page. And here's What's Tech? on SoundCloud. And here you can subscribe via RSS. Especially your cute dog After this week, new episodes of What's Tech? will appear every Tuesday. And we're flirting with the idea of special episodes for big, important topics and events. You know, mini-episodes that would helpfully explain the real important, really confusing stuff, so that you can keep up with your friends who always seem to know everything about every thing. Like maybe a Fifty Shades of Grey episode? Would that be useful? Anyway, if you like the podcast, be sure to leave a review here. And if you don't like the podcast, leave a review here. We'll see you next week. Oh, you can leave through the door. It's unlocked. You'd rather leave through the window? Your parents never taught you to use doors? You've been breaking windows for the past 30 years, and you'd appreciate an episode of What's Tech? that explains how doors work? That's why you're here? Sure, yeah, we can probably get around to that. Goodbye. *Sound of window breaking*",0.5461257447382787,0.4538742552617213,0.19327128390547232,445,4.7707865168539323,289,5.4429065743944633,0,0,"Culture, Tech, Web, What's Tech, Podcast",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Google CEO Larry Page wants to set aside a part of the world for such experimentation, and PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel thinks a floating island of entrepreneurs might do the job. By those standards, venture capitalist Tim Draper actually has a slightly more down-to-earth plan. The startup mogul is now proposing to split California into six new states, each of which could craft laws that reflect their local interests. While the state of Silicon Valley hires more overseas engineers, Draper imagines, a new ""South California"" could simultaneously crack down on immigration. ""West California"" could cater laws to Hollywood and defense contractors, and ""Central California"" could focus on farming and water rights without city slickers getting in the way. Splitting up California isn't remotely a new idea, nor would it be a new idea for practically any other state. Wikipedia maintains a huge list of US state partition proposals, and California has its very own page. ""I will make sure it gets on the ballot."" But Draper is serious about the idea. He believes he can get the the proposal on California's ballot next November. The venture capitalist already submitted a five-page proposal to the California Attorney General, and he hopes to embark on a grassroots campaign to raise the nearly one-million signatures it would require to put the idea to a preliminary vote next year. At a press conference on Monday, he joked that he would spend ""as little as possible"" of his own money on the campaign, but suggested that he would personally fund the first step. ""I will make sure it gets on the ballot,"" he told reporters in attendance. Democrats could say no Dividing California wouldn't be as simple as a single vote, though. Article IV of the US Constitution states that Congress would need to approve as well. With five new states, California would have ten new senators, and that could give Congress a reason to say no. Political science professor John Pitney told the San Jose Mercury News that Democrats would likely oppose a plan that would give conservatives more seats in Congress — as it might if conservative regions of California suddenly became states. At the press conference, Draper didn't have a good answer for why the rest of the United States would benefit from California's division. He merely argued in vague terms that the United States would be better off as a whole if its parts were better governed. ""I think it's going to be indifference from Congress,"" he says. Draper's proposal doesn't include ways for California to actually achieve better governance, only suggesting that smaller states would be better equipped to govern themselves, which casts some doubt on the plan. But lest you think that a Silicon Valley venture capitalist is hoping that Silicon Valley can run away with all the money, it's worth noting that the Los Angeles area is responsible for more of California's gross domestic product than all of Silicon Valley. Primarily, it sounds like Draper simply believes — like many before him — that something has got to give. ""It's really starting to crumble,"" he says. ""The status quo will let it crumble, and I don't want to let it crumble. I want to make it work.""",0.4953399123676757,0.5046600876323243,0.8229874680714658,556,4.9820143884892083,321,5.9003115264797508,0,0,"Policy & Law, US & World, Report",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

The primary issue, brought by a coalition of groups before the country's supreme court, is the encroachment on a lava field that was designated a protected area in 2009. The secondary issue, which has captured many more headlines, is the welfare of Huldufolk, or elven ""hidden folk"" who may be living nearby. Polls say a majority of Icelanders are at least open to the idea of the existence of elves, and concern for elven well-being has halted construction projects before. This endearing trivia has been regurgitated in travelogues and news articles, and there are some elf advocates protesting this road project. But some Icelanders say it's not as common as outsiders claim. Icelandic media are hitting back The Associated Press reported that the highway from the Álftanes peninsula to a suburb of Reykjavik was being halted in order to resolve claims that it would disturb an elven church. Icelandic media are hitting back, however, saying the AP story includes factual errors and exaggerates the country's belief in elves. The AP story omitted the fact that the land was protected, for example.
