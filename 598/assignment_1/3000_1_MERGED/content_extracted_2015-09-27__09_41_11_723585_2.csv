The challenges went nowhere. Six months later, he began contacting reporters. Contacted for comment, an NSA spokesman told the Post there was no record of the conversations. Snowden takes particular issue over the FISA court, which he described as authorizing general warrants for the metadata of an entire country.

To supporters, the metadata collection is a limited system that's rarely queried and doesn't contain enough information to be considered an invasive search: the NSA has said it doesn't collect either the content of calls or the names attached to phone numbers. As many technology and legal experts on the other side say, though, metadata matters, and a Stanford Security Lab project demonstrates that removing names from a database doesn't effectively mean much. Last month, Patrick Mutchler and Jonathan Mayer released an Android app called MetaPhone that allowed them to pull phone records — with permission — from users' phones. In an ongoing series, they're now showing what can be gleaned from that information: most recently, how easy it is to correlate numbers with names. First, they simply pulled 5,000 numbers from their MetaPhone dataset and checked them against Facebook, Yelp, and Google Places; these three services let them match 27.1 percent of the numbers with a name or business. From there, they looked at a smaller set of 100 numbers, approximating what might happen if a team of analysts manually searched through metadata. A Google search of each number pulled up an individual or business name for 60 of the 100 in under an hour; running the numbers through the Intelius public records database identified 74 of them. By combining the results of all searches, Mutchler and Mayer could identify 91 of the numbers — and, as they rightly point out, they have access to much less information than the NSA, though 100 numbers is a tiny, nonrepresentative fragment of the full database. 91 of a 100-number sample could be identified through a combination of public records searches With the details provided, it's hard to tell how many of these numbers were actually those of people, and how many belonged to businesses that post their numbers publicly. Even if finding the name of a customer service line isn't much of a coup, though, the fact that phone record databases contain well-known, high-traffic numbers poses its own problems. In a previous post, Mutchler and Mayer analyzed how many numbers could be reached by the three ""hops"" the NSA can go from its original query. Civil liberties groups have estimated that these hops could include millions of people, and this dataset showed a hub and spoke network that could link numbers that had virtually no connection to each other. Anybody who dialed into T-Mobile's voicemail system, for example, could theoretically be connected to any other dialer. ""Suppose, for example, that a suspicious number is phoned by a Skype user; a different Skype user has called FedEx; and you have phoned FedEx,"" writes Mayer. ""You're fair game."" If your number is queried and you're identified, your phone records can give away anything from medical conditions to who you're dating. That's one of the reasons Judge Richard Leon determined that comprehensive record collection wasn't the same as a non-invasive, temporary phone tap. Of course, none of this is really a revelation. Mutchler and Mayer are essentially demonstrating the things that metadata collection opponents have been arguing for months, stripping away one of the Obama administration's more common fig leaves. It's also making the problems with metadata collection a little more concrete for users: if you install MetaPhone, you can check your own records to see how closely you're connected to other users and who in your address book can be identified. The NSA's counter has consistently been that even if these technological capabilities exist, they haven't been misused, making privacy fears mostly theoretical. Nonetheless, the agency is increasingly being pushed towards dismantling its in-house phone record database and relying instead on phone companies to provide individual pieces of data thought to be related to an investigation. That doesn't mean that the NSA couldn't get similar results, but it would take highly identifiable data out of the agency's servers and, potentially, raise the bar for requesting it.",0.4908643170901351,0.5091356829098649,0.2431840995214075,688,5.2005813953488369,391,6.2455242966751916,0,0,"Policy & Law, US & World, National Security",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

While serving as a tank commander in World War II, RT reports, he discovered an aptitude for designing small arms after recuperating from an injury. By 1949, the Soviet Armed Forces had adopted the AK-47 based on its ease of use, reasonable accuracy, and durability. Since then, the AK's presence in both war and popular culture has been nearly unavoidable — especially since manufacturing the gun is simple enough to have spread worldwide. The rifle now adorns the flags of both Mozambique and Hezbollah. Meanwhile, movies like Lord of War and Quentin Tarantino's Jackie Brown lavish praise on the weapon.

Spotify analysts scrutinized the success of Meghan Trainor's pop hit ""All About That Bass"" in two markets — in the United States, where the song appeared in stores, on streaming services, and on the radio at the same time, and the United Kingdom, where the song only went on sale a month and a half after it first appeared on Spotify UK.     The graphs representing the song's streams, sales, and Shazam tags are wildly different in shape. In the US, where fans could buy or stream the song from June 30th, we see a steady bell curve, rising to a peak in late August, before dipping slowly throughout Fall and into Winter. Shazam tags, which kept pace with the sales and streams, are a less concrete measure of success, but do show that the song was becoming increasingly ubiquitous, forcing people to turn to their phones to work out what they were hearing. The proportion of those people who were researching the song with aims of hearing it again would have been able to either buy or stream it on the spot.   In the UK, however, the rush of Shazam tags for ""All About That Bass"" peaked a week before the song was available in stores. The windowing meant anyone keen to legally acquire a copy of Trainor's song would have to stream it via a subscription service, try to maintain their interest for seven days, or simply watch it on YouTube, where it had been available worldwide since June 11th. Despite the month-and-a-half gap between US and UK releases, streaming figures for the song remained strong in Britain, showing a similar curve to the US graph and propelling Trainor into the UK singles charts on streams alone. But unlike the US figures, Trainor saw her song's sales dropped precipitously a few days after ""All About That Bass"" became available to buy in late September. In the US, the song was available for stream and sale at the same time. The Spotify study concludes that ""the practice of windowing on any licensed platform — be it streaming or downloads — looks distinctly behind the curve."" Releasing the song as a buyable product weeks after the most people are searching for it ""leaves money on the table,"" as Spotify says, but it also gives people who can't wait for the official release time to discover and download pirate versions. Of course, there's no guarantee those people would have bought a legitimate copy of Trainor's song, but huge fans might have had their hand forced with no other way to access an offline copy. The answer — supported both by the Spotify's data and by consumers sick of arbitrarily varied worldwide release windows — appears to be for media companies to realize that the internet is a global creation, and end the practice of windowing. But as Taylor Swift and other musical megastars assert their control over their catalogs, removing them from streaming services and attempting to enforce exclusives, it doesn't seem like record companies will be smashing release windows just yet.",0.5371644207008809,0.4628355792991191,0.8684231888077503,548,4.7226277372262775,299,5.7725752508361206,0,4,"Culture, Entertainment",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Reddit's /r/serialpodcast, created to serve the fanatical following of one of the most successful podcasts of all time, had already been named subreddit of the day, and by mid-afternoon, the listing and comment pages were pulling in over 80,000 page views every hour. Most redditors were pleasantly surprised by the show's last episode (""Fucking fantastic""), others grieved for the end of a show they'd grown to embrace. (""It has been one hell of a ride. I am going to miss it dearly."") In all, the subreddit got more than a million page views on the day of the finale. But now that the first season of Serial is in the can, will the Reddit devotees stay on the case, or will they dissolve into the ether of the web, and move on to the next obsession? The debut season of Serial — which chronicles the journalist Sarah Koenig's tireless, personal, nit-picky yet captivating investigation into the 1999 murder of Hae Min Lee and the conviction of her ex-boyfriend Adnan Syed — is arguably the first podcast blockbuster. It not only draws an average estimated 2.2 million listeners per episode, but has inspired at least one so-so Miley Cyrus mash up, one slightly more respectable Biggie remix, a Funny or Die parody, and a spot for Koenig on our very own 2014 Verge 50 list. Koenig even landed a coveted spot on one of The Colbert Report's last episodes. Serial found a particularly fertile fanbase in Reddit, where the Serial subreddit just hit 30,000 members yesterday (compare that to This American Life, with just over 2,000 subscribers). Redditors are nothing if not obsessive — perfect targets for the minute-by-minute discrepancies, countless characters, the theories, counter-theories, and conspiracies of Serial. So they threw themselves into Hae Min Lee's case wholeheartedly; one user admitted to developing a Pavlovian reaction to hearing the first notes of the podcast's theme song. Redditors are nothing if not obsessive Some Redditors took it upon themselves to crack the case, going to incredible lengths to uncover some piece of evidence that Koenig hadn't, searching for proof of Adnan's innocence or else a clue that would condemn him beyond a reasonable doubt. Visit the subreddit and you'll find, among other things, a transcript of each episode, cell phone records of calls made by Adnan, a list of everyone ever mentioned in the podcast, at least 19 different maps (including a global map of all Serial subreddit subscribers), homemade ""guided tour"" videos of the areas featured in the podcast, polls, photos, related links, and more.  ""I had never really seen a community like this one,"" says Jacob White, 34. When White isn't moderating the Serial subreddit, he works as a Broadway stagehand in New York City. Before stumbling onto Serial he says he had no interest in true crime, and only visited Reddit from time to time. But as he sank into the details of the case, he needed a space to organize his thoughts. He was one of the first to join the Serial subreddit and compiled the page's character list. ""It was useful for me to visually keep track of names and places,"" he told me over the phone. Unlike other podcasts, Serial had countless documents to pore over and obsess, scrutinize and argue over.  ""What made this one different,' he says, ""was that people felt a connection and ability to interact with the story more than just be a passive listener."" ""People felt a connection and ability to interact with the story more than just be a passive listener."" White became a moderator, and at first took the time to read and vet every post. He and other moderators tried to keep a handle on the conversation:  ""We wanted to make sure that the privacy of people involved were maintained so that Redditors weren't blaming innocent people,"" he says. The memory of the Boston Bombings fiasco, in which Redditors quickly, and incorrectly, identified a suspect, was still fresh in everyone's mind. The community made a concerted effort to police itself, protecting identities and not offering any personal details beyond what Koenig revealed in the podcast itself. But as the number of subscribers grew, moderators lost the ability to monitor each and every conversation. Addresses slipped out, as did last names and Facebook pages. A couple weeks ago, one Redditor admitted to The Guardian's Michelle Dean that they'd located one of the characters in the show and driven by their home. ""I was just curious like everybody else,"" he told Dean. In the age of Google, it's not hard to become an amateur sleuth, and some couldn't resist the opportunity to launch miniature investigations of their own. ""There are users that are going to post the phone numbers and the addresses and the email addresses of anybody real connected to this case if we let them,"" White told me. ""It's a real-life case and people can go and they can play internet detective, for good or bad.""  ""Investigation is like tennis,"" says Richard Plansky, the Executive Managing Director and head of operations in the Americas of K2 Intelligence, an international investigations outfit. ""Everyone can pick up a tennis racket and hit a tennis ball. But very few people can be Roger Federer."" As a prosecutor at the Manhattan's DA office during the '90s (when New York, he says, ""was a much different city""), Plansky worked on homicides and sex crimes — cases not unlike the murder of Hae Min Lee. Plansky says that amateurs can, on the occasion, be helpful to an investigation. But they can also do more harm than good, and sometimes that harm is irreparable. ""There's a lot of trade craft here that, typically, amateur detectives don't understand,"" he said. ""And there are also ethical and legal restrictions that amateur detectives aren't even aware of."" In states like New York, conducting an unlicensed private investigation is a criminal offense. If one doesn't follow the law, any evidence gathered may be inadmissible, or else tainted. ""This is why we have the police, this is why we have federal law enforcement authorities, this is why we have federal and state prosecutors,"" Plansky said. ""This is what they do; this is what they're trained to do. They have the tools to do it that the average person does not have. While I think it's important for everybody as citizens to do their job — meaning if they're witnesses to crime, to assist the authorities in any way they can — I don't think it's their jobs to actually conduct the investigations."" Another Serial moderator I spoke with, PowerOfYes (as a working lawyer in Australia, she asked not to be identified), told me that for the most part, Redditors weren't actually bringing much new evidence to the table. But the way she sees it, the debates and arguments of the subreddit weren't just a matter of idle curiosity, but an act of civic engagement. ""A murder is a crime against a state, not a crime against person,"" she said. ""That's the basis on which we prosecute people. And if you are a prosecutor, you appear on behalf of the state, and that means you appear on behalf of us."" To PowerOfYes, the idea that the Reddit discussions didn't have legitimacy because they involved amateurs, or that the debate over the particularities of the case somehow diminishes the memory of Hae Min Lee, is wrong. ""I don't think it's right to turn away from it when you have a chance to scrutinize how the system works. It's like voting. You shouldn't vote if you don't take even a little bit of interest in what you're voting for."" ""I don't think it's right to turn away when you have a chance to scrutinize how the system works."" As for whether she expects the same level of civic engagement (or plain old obsession) to persist now that the show's first season has come to a close, she's doubtful. Though she'll be monitoring the subreddit — as a lawyer, she's interested in the legal and systemic issues in play — she says she'd be surprised if by January there was much activity on the site at all. Even though Adnan still sits in a Maryland prison, there's no reason for anyone except the hardcore to come back to the subreddit. ""Now that the show's over,"" she said, ""there's nothing new to discover."" Not that there haven't been efforts made to create a more lasting legacy. A few days before the podcast's final episode, moderators on the subreddit launched the Woodlawn High School Scholarship Fund, which would provide academic funding to students currently attending Lee's school. It's an attempt by an ephemeral community to make a lasting impact. Or as White told me, ""There was an outcry from people that wanted to do something positive — people wanted to counteract the distastefulness of consuming other people's tragedies for their own entertainment."" To date, the fund has drawn just $3,200 in donations, or 12 percent of its $25,000 goal. For many, the intrigue was as much about Koenig's telling of the case as it was about the crime itself. Without the podcast, interest is bound to drop off. ""I'm sure we'll see a lot of our regular users move on,"" White told me. ""I could see people hanging out for about a week."" ""No one was happy when Breaking Bad ended, but it just has to happen,"" White said. ""Maybe it's a little distasteful to compare true crime to a piece of entertainment fiction. But podcasts, to be honest, are a combination of a news venue and an entertainment medium. And people consume this podcast in particular the same way they consume entertainment."" White said he didn't have very strong convictions about the nature of the case, and wasn't terribly invested in finding out whether Syed was innocent or guilty. While he likes the idea of a wrongfully convicted murderer finally finding justice, he's not certain whether that's the case here, or whether it was just a good narrative. Still, even before this season of Serial wrapped up, he was already looking forward to the next one. ""I'm a listener of a podcast,"" he told me. ""That's all there is. I'm not an investigator. I'm not Sarah Koenig.""",0.6419600407295616,0.3580399592704384,0.5399074896340667,1734,4.8246828143021911,826,6.2518159806295399,0,0,"Culture, Entertainment, Report",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Here's what's coming up, from strange dramas to unlikely horror to the next big dystopia. Check out this week's best trailers below.   With The Hunger Games leaving theaters, it's time to start looking toward the other big young-adult dystopia: Divergent. The series is certainly the less popular and acclaimed of the two, but it'll be taking its second shot next year. You can see the first full trailer for Insurgent to get a sense of how it turned out. It's scheduled for a release on March 20th.   Parks and Recreation is back for one final season starting just under a month from now. The show's final season promises to take viewers into the near future, where everything and nothing has changed. It'll be on NBC starting January 13th.   I'm not really sure why there are so many shootouts in a hacker movie, but I trust that director Michael Mann, who also did Heat, has good reason for it. Blackhat takes the fear over cyberattacks that's beginning to grow in governments worldwide to its obvious climax: a major attack. Chris Hemsworth stars. It'll be out on January 16th.   This is how Disney reworks one of the most famous fairy tales into a live-action film. The results are a bit different than the Cinderella you might remember, but it looks like the film is trying to do some interesting things with its use of color in an attempt to build out a fairy-tale world. It'll be in theaters March 13th.   This movie looks gorgeous and brilliantly composed in just about every way. The Duke of Burgundy's offbeat and beautiful look at kink and sexuality seems to have wowed every critic that's seen it, and this trailer makes it easy to see why. It'll be in theaters and on-demand beginning January 23rd.   What a stylish, tense, and beautiful trailer! The only negative to this trailer is that you'll have no idea what the movie is actually about, and it has a pretty interesting story: it's based on the urban legend that a woman who believed Fargo was a true story headed out to North Dakota to find money still buried at the end of the film. It'll be out early next year.   It looks like Christian Bale and Terrence Malick make one heck of a team. Bale stars in Malick's latest film, a strange and wild tale of celebrity and excess. Cate Blanchett and Natalie Portman also star. If you're a Malick fan, this is obviously a must-watch. And if you just like the actors involved, check it out anyway for one heck of a ride. The film will probably come out sometime next year.   First of all, let's just reflect on the fact that it's 2014 and The Interview was just cancelled and we're now about to watch a trailer where James Franco and Jonah Hill are playing serious roles opposite one another. True Story, which is, in fact, based on a true story, is a tense adaptation of the memoir of journalist Michael Finkel, who is brought into the life of an alleged murderer who wants his supposedly true story told to the world. It'll be out April 10th.   Clint Eastwood's next film appears to be a tense and difficult look at one man's time at war. The film dramatizes the story of Chris Kyle, a sniper who is said to be the most lethal is US military history. It's based on Kyle's autobiography of the same name. The film will be out on Christmas day.   '71 has been getting some great reviews everywhere it's screened so far. The film takes place over the course of a single night and follows a soldier in Northern Ireland who's left behind enemy lines as civil war nears. The trailer makes it look like a pretty standard war film at first, but by the end it's clear that '71 tries to place its characters in far more nuanced situations than a typical film. It'll be out in the US on February 27th.   It Follows has been getting a lot of buzz as one of the smarter and scarier recent horror films. This teaser shows why it's a bit more than all-out horror: it's also about being a teenager and struggles with sexuality. It'll be out in the UK on February 27th and in the US one month later.   And now to close with something a little lighter. The Backstreet Boys are still around, even if they're far from the stars that they used to be. Filmed over two years, the documentary Show 'Em What You're Made Of tracks their rise and fall, the alleged theft of millions of dollars from them by their manager, and their recent attempts at a comeback. It'll be in theaters and on-demand January 30th.",0.6312666104207005,0.36873338957929946,0.19926532398250016,836,4.3720095693779903,430,5.6093023255813952,0,0,"Culture, Entertainment",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

HBO Now can also be watched through web browsers, and you'll get a free month of access if you sign up through an Apple device during the month of April. An iPhone app is also available in the App Store. During last month's Apple press event, HBO CEO Richard Plepler promised that Now would launch in time for the Game of Thrones season five premiere, which airs this Sunday. That will obviously serve as a significant test for the service's reliability, but for now you've got a few days to comb through HBO's massive vault of content. Apple slashed the Apple TV's price to $69 in an attempt to drum up sales to go along with the introduction of HBO Now.

HBO Now has officially launched across Apple TV and iOS. Subscriptions can be purchased directly through iTunes — your first month is free — and the HBO Now iPhone app hints that Cablevision will begin selling the service very soon. So now that it's here, what's HBO's standalone service like to use? Well, it's very familiar. It's HBO Go sans cable. In other words, it's exactly what we were anticipating, and that's fine.   We had some trouble registering for the service in the immediate moments after it went live this morning. Things seem to be settling now, but some users are still experiencing problems. As you go through the set-up process, you'll agree to a bunch of fine print most people will probably ignore. But there's some interesting stuff in there. For one, HBO is reserving the right to change the amount of simultaneous streams that customers can watch whenever it chooses and without warning. HBO may change the maximum number of simultaneous streams and/or registered devices that you may use at any time. HBO reserves the right to shut down password sharing Should login sharing become a real problem that eats into HBO Now's success, the company has given itself full allowance to get much stricter about where and when you can watch. But don't be alarmed just yet. Knowing that this is a service for cord cutters, HBO is at least partially open to the idea of users sharing HBO Now between family members. Another section of the user agreement mentions that you can add ""authorized users"" who can use the service under your own account. HBO warns that this should only be used for people living in the same household, but will that be something it somehow tries to enforce? There's no telling right now.   Once you successfully register, you'll find that the HBO Now app on Apple TV is largely identical to HBO Go. And there's no reason it shouldn't be; HBO has made clear from the start that Now would offer its full vault of original shows and catalog movies. You're not losing anything here compared to cable customers, nor should you expect to get anything extra. At least, not yet. Fast Company's interview with CEO Richard Plepler hints that HBO Now may eventually offer programming that won't appear on the main, linear network. Those possibilities are exciting, but they're not here at launch. Aside from the home screen, HBO Now's main navigation bar is divided into six sections: Watchlist, Series, Movies, More, Search, and Settings. Aside from ""More,"" which is where you'll find HBO sports and comedy specials, they're all pretty self explanatory. From anywhere in the app, you can add shows and movies to your Watchlist. Series is where you'll find HBO's long history of acclaimed original shows like The Sopranos or current hits like Game of Thrones. As for movies, HBO has a pretty extensive collection of on-demand films, and helpfully gives you the precise date when each one will be leaving the service.   As usual with Apple TV apps, navigating around is dead simple. It's incredibly user friendly and obvious; select any show or movie and you can start playing it instantly, watch a brief preview, add it to your watch list, or hit ""more"" for cast and crew information. So the Apple TV channel is functional, but also a bit bland and inelegant. Especially in the movies section, expect to find yourself scrolling through large grids of icons, which has become another hallmark of the Apple TV experience. None of that's a huge annoyance on iPhone or iPad, where things are laid out better and browsing content is faster and more efficient since you're swiping through everything. The Apple TV experience is a bit boring, but it works just fine If HBO Go is any indication, the company will have more freedom to experiment with menus and user interface whenever Now inevitably reaches other living room boxes and game consoles. (See: HBO Go on PlayStation 4.) Still, it's perfectly usable on Apple TV, and you're here for the content more so than the app itself. Playback seems to work just fine. Streams start up promptly and display in HD without any noticeable buffering or freezing issues, so MLB Advanced Media seems to be doing a decent job handling the backend of HBO's standalone service. So far, anyway. We'll see how things hold up Sunday night when the internet is in full Game of Thrones mode. Reliability may go out the window. If you're in Apple's ecosystem, it's a no brainer Signing up for the free month's trial of HBO Now is something of a no brainer. This is something people have spent years waiting for, and it won't take long to decide whether HBO's content library is worth your $14.99 each month. And even then, remember that there's no commitment involved, so you can theoretically come and go whenever your favorite HBO shows are in-season. Obviously the company would prefer you stick with it, but there's nothing that says you have to. At launch, HBO Now on Apple TV is just what we expected it to be. It's HBO Go without the costly cable package. If you don't have any Apple devices around, jumping in right now might not make the most sense. Cord cutting Android users will need to keep borrowing someone else's HBO Go login for now. In the months ahead, HBO Now should develop into a richer experience and one available on many more devices. But for right now, all you need is the internet — and Apple.

It softens the blacks and colors in your image for an ""aged film effect"" (Instagram's terms), and that effect can be adjusted using the same slider mechanism found throughout the app. The Color tool can be used to add a specifically hued tint to either the shadows or highlights of an image. It's not as subtle an effect, but you can adjust the severity of the tint with a slider here as well .

Though All Access has already been available on the web and through iOS and Android apps, the addition makes Roku — which already has a huge number of online channels — an even more compelling option for those looking for a device that'll let them cancel cable.  You can still only stream if you live in one of 14 markets For now, CBS All Access' killer feature — the ability to watch CBS as it's airing live — is only available in 14 markets. That includes New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Philadelphia, Dallas, San Francisco, Boston, Detroit, Minneapolis, Miami, Denver, Sacramento, Pittsburgh, and Baltimore. CBS says that more locations are coming ""soon,"" but it doesn't mention where or exactly when. Notably, those live streams do not include NFL games, though other sports content is available. CBS does mention that you can expect to see All Access on more platforms very soon. ""The launch of the CBS All Access channel marks the first of many connected device platforms we’ll be bringing this service to in the coming months,"" Marc DeBevoise, a CBS Interactive exec, says in a statement. One would expect the Apple TV to be among those, but Apple has exclusives of its own for now: for the next three months, it's the only streaming box that's going to have HBO Now.

NASA will be providing the location, as well as a catalog of photos and other digital assets for developers, who will have just three days to put together their games. The goal is to create experiences that ""will help capture the public's interest in the real science and technology advancements being made in aerospace exploration."" And for NASA, there's the potential to engage with people in a different way. ""Games you can play on your computer or smartphone offer variety and a different way to learn about space and science,"" says Sam Ortega, NASA's program manager for the Centennial Challenges initiative.  ""The game design community and NASA share an entrepreneurial spirit."" NASA's interest in games isn't new. In addition to numerous smaller titles aimed at a young audience, the agency has also released ""serious"" games like the lunar exploration title Moonbase Alpha in the past. More recently there was Mars Rover Landing on the Xbox 360, which was used to drum up some added excitement for Curiosity's martian expedition. But this is the first time NASA has hosted a game jam, an event where developers attempt to create playable prototypes in a limited period of time. Dark Side of the Jam, as the event is known, is part of the Night Rover Challenge, an initiative meant to drive new advances in energy storage technology. Games may not sound like the best way to solve such problem, but Ortega believes that game creators and NASA share similar sensibilities. ""The game design community and NASA share an entrepreneurial spirit,"" he says. Co-organizer Brendan Mauro, from developer Lazy 8 Studios, got involved with the project through contacts made researching his own upcoming space-themed game, Extrasolar. Games designed to be educational typically aren't the most exciting experiences, dysentery related deaths aside, but Mauro still believes that they have something to offer. ""Games are really great for teaching you something in a way not many other mediums can do due to their interactive nature,"" he explains. ""I think 'educational' is a label that often gives people a bad taste, that it's easy to assume 'educational' and 'fun' or 'engaging' are mutually exclusive. But lots of great games teach people things. Portal, for instance, taught you things about gravity and acceleration and spatial continuity.""  ""We're hoping this will foster some inspiration and creativity for both parties."" In addition to the assets and physical location NASA is providing, agency staff will also be on site during the jam. The hope is that they will mingle with developers and that everyone will share a bit of what they're working on — whether it's a small game or an important research project. ""We're hoping this will foster some inspiration and creativity for both parties,"" says Mauro. The event has certainly created interest in the game development community. It took just four days to fill up the 200 spots at the Ames Center, while a number of satellite events are also being planned for when the jam kicks off. Mauro credits the response on social media for the big turnout. ""To risk the use of a horrible pun,"" he says of the response, ""it's been astronomical."" The jam is just the latest attempt by NASA to create more interest in its next wave of space exploration efforts, in the wake of increased focus on private and crowdfunded companies. Not only was there the massive spectacle that was Curiosity's Mars adventure — which included everything from a Foursquare badge to a guest appearance in Times Square — but we've also been able to get closer to the International Space Station than ever, while also learning about the next expedition to Mars. Video games are simply a way to potentially reach a different audience. While we won't know just what kinds of games will come out of the event until the jam ends on March 10th, Mauro says that the goal is to create experiences that serve two purposes: getting players excited about space and science, and maybe teaching them something along the way as well. It's virtually impossible to create polished, complete games in such a short period of time, but the constraints of a game jam often lead to innovative new ideas — the time-travelling Super T.I.M.E. Force, for instance, was conceived at the annual Toronto Game Jam. Adding the stipulation of making a game that's both educational and fun could make Dark Side even more challenging than your typical game jam. It could also lead to games that have an even stronger impact on players, should these games ever be released to the public. ""I would love for someone to play somebody's game from the jam and go 'wow, that was awesome, I want to know more about stuff like this' and that be the start of them pursuing a career in rocketry or orbital engineering or something,"" says Mauro.",0.7420600983188977,0.25793990168110226,0.5028865883427147,855,4.9345029239766083,456,6.1030701754385968,0,0,"Gaming, Science, Report",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Doctors are hopeful that the results may be replicated and used to treat infants infected by pregnancy or delivery in the first few days of life.  Despite ending treatment the child now has no identifiable levels of HIV   According to the National Institutes of Health, a two-year old child born with HIV — the virus responsible for AIDS — is now ""functionally cured"" of the infection following the early administration of antiretroviral therapy. Doctors initially detected small levels of the virus in the baby, concluding that the infection occurred before the infant's premature birth in July 2010, and began treatment of a liquid antiretroviral around 30 hours of age. The infant's HIV-infected mother reportedly had received no antiretroviral medication or prenatal care, and was unaware she had been infected with the virus. After 18 months of treatment, the child was taken off therapy ""for reasons that are unclear,"" but doctors say that despite ending treatment the child now has no identifiable levels of HIV in the body. Scientists say it's an unprecedented development; according to NIH, it's the first well-documented case of an HIV-infected child who has been cured of the infection. According to The New York Times, the lead author on today's report, Dr. Deborah Persaud of the Johns Hopkins Children's Center, says that ""it's proof of principle that we can cure HIV infection if we can replicate this case."" Persaud says that ""for pediatrics, this is our Timothy Brown,"" in reference to the only other person known to have been cured of HIV. Brown, an adult, was cured via a risky bone-marrow transplant that's difficult to replicate. ""We may have a promising lead for additional research toward curing other children."" While the results are stunning and promising, the researchers in the study say that further research will be required to know whether this child's experience can be replicated in clinical trials with other HIV-infected children. The New York Times reports that some experts need additional information, including confirmation that the baby had actually been infected, to determine if the case involved a cure or prevention of infection — prevention that can already be done for babies with infected mothers. The Times notes that unlike the expensive and dangerous treatment given to Timothy Brown, the aggressive pediatric treatment announced today could become ""a new standard of care."" ""Despite the fact that research has given us the tools to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV, many infants are unfortunately still born infected,"" said National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Anthony S.

The fines are $95 per adult and $47.50 per child, or 1 percent of family income, whichever is greater.

The 191-page document lays out details on how Megaupload and its associated sites, employees, and operations — termed the ""Mega Conspiracy"" — operated and, according to the DOJ, committed racketeering conspiracy, copyright infringement, and money laundering. The investigation concludes that Megaupload made over $150 million in revenues from premium memberships over the years, plus over $25 million in advertising revenues. Those revenues are said to be a direct result of Megaupload's willful promotion of copyrighted materials. Perhaps the most interesting revelation from the document are details on the files stored for Megaupload and its users. According to the DOJ, when it shut down the site on January 19, 2012, there were roughly 14.9 million videos on Megavideo.com. Only 8.6 million of those videos were viewed at least once, with a total of 34.9 billion views for all of the videos. The document says that roughly 12.8 percent of all viewed videos had received at least one Digital Millennium Copyright Act take-down request. Additionally, the DOJ claims that 43 percent of all views on Megavideo.com — about 15 billion streams — were of content that had received a take-down notice. URLs uploaded by members with at least one take-down request against them accounted for roughly 78 percent of all streams, according to the DOJ. Evidence claims 43 percent of all videos streamed on Megavideo.com likely infringed copyrights  Files uploaded by one of the site's top members, referred to as ""TH"" in the document, were responsible for 1.2 million downloads from 2006 to 2011. He allegedly made $50,000 through the site's Uploader Rewards program, even though his files received 1,200 take-down notices. Among the pile of evidence is an email communication from 2007 between Megaupload employees and alleged conspirators Mathias Ortmann and Bram van der Kolk that calls ""TH"" ""one of our most important uploaders ... I don’t regret any of the dollars we send him every month."" Another major piece of evidence comes from ""undercover"" work done by an FBI agent to download, view, and monitor how Mega sites operated. His work involved downloading shows like Modern Family and movies like those in the Twilight saga. He also uploaded files for which the copyright holder then issued take-down notices, and he found that copyright holders could only stop individual URLs to files. Since Megaupload generated a new URL each time a user tried to upload a file already found on its servers, thousands of URLs could point to a single piece of infringing content. The DOJ claims that Mega deceived copyright holders into thinking that a takedown request would block the file while the only way to do so was to find and issue a request for every URL. ""191 pages of meritless criminal allegations."" The Justice Department uses the evidence to claim that Kim Dotcom and others involved with Megaupload are not protected by the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which would give them ""safe harbor"" from copyright suits involving media uploaded to Mega sites by users. Specifically, the DOJ says they ""do not meet these criteria because they are willfully infringing copyrights themselves; ... they have actual knowledge that the materials on their systems are infringing; ... they receive a financial benefit directly attributable to the copyright-infringing activity; ... they failed to terminate repeat infringers; and they have not removed, or disabled access to, known copyright-infringing material from servers they control."" The lawyer for Kim Dotcom and Megaupload tells Variety that the document is ""191 pages of meritless criminal allegations,"" adding that ""all those things are civil in nature and can never be considered criminal in the United States."" Their defense hinges on the case being kept out of criminal court — ""safe harbor"" only applies to civil cases. Kim Dotcom and other defendants are currently in New Zealand fighting extradition to the US.

Start-stop could be big The reason appears to be that manufacturers would rather build advanced gasoline engines than drastically change their vehicle lineups, and the EIA predicts that tech which empowers more efficient gasoline engines will be a big deal.

""In all the reviews, it hasn't been alleged that the NSA in some ways acted inappropriately in the use of this data,"" he said. ""But what is also clear in the public debate, people are concerned about the prospect, the possibility of abuse."" Much of the conversation in the past weeks has focused on the bulk phone data collection program that was revealed in June; the panel has recommended that the intelligence community dismantle its collection of virtually all American phone records. Obama confirmed his support for this proposal: ""It is possible, for example, that some of the same information that the intelligence community feels is required to keep people safe can be obtained by having the private phone companies keep these records longer, and to create some mechanism in which they can be accessed in an effective fashion."" He brushed off criticism from federal judge Richard Leon, who ruled that the bulk record collection was an ""Orwellian"" program that likely violated the fourth amendment. Obama declined to speak specifically about the chance of a pardon or plea deal for Edward Snowden. ""Mr. Snowden is under indictment. He's been charged with crimes.

Why would the NSA go to the trouble of inserting a inferior standard into NIST's set of four, when most cryptographers would simply ignore the bad algorithm in favor of the others? Even if foul play had occurred, what was the agency getting out of the deal? The NSA could subvert the encryption whenever they needed to Now, a Reuters exclusive report is showing the other side of the story. The report details a secret deal between the NSA and respected encryption company RSA, in which the agency paid $10 million for RSA to incorporate the weaker algorithm into an encryption product called BSafe. Because of the earlier work, the algorithm had been approved by NIST, so RSA could claim their encryption used only nationally certified protocols. At the same time, BSafe's encryption was defaulting to a fundamentally flawed encryption algorithm, which the NSA could subvert whenever they needed to. Anyone who knows the right numbers can decipher the resulting cryptotext The bad program in question is known as DUAL_EC_DRBG, and cryptographers have found it suspicious for years. The program has a random number generator, but there are a number of fixed, constant numbers built into the algorithm that can function as a kind of skeleton key. Anyone who knows the right numbers can decipher the resulting cryptotext — a feature that leaked Snowden documents confirm was installed by the NSA. The algorithm is also more than a hundred times slower than the alternative random number generators, which has led almost all major encryption programs to abandon the program. However, since BSafe is based on closed-source protocols, RSA was able to implement DUAL_EC_DRBG as a default setting effectively in secret. In a statement to Reuters, RSA denied the allegations it had implemented the backdoor.

Comics captivated us in 2014. While Marvel and DC ramped up their commitment to movies and TV,  comic book publishers like Image and Monkeybrain showed us that there's more than enough room (and demand) for female characters, people of color, and LGBTQ characters in sequential art. But the social progress that was splashed all over our panels this year wasn't the only reason comics got our attention. The science fiction genre gained momentum in 2014, in part because comics pushed boundaries and told stories that really wouldn't work in any other format.  Nightsream / Wikimedia Commons Saga, a space opera published by Image comics, is a great example of what can happen when you put that all together. At a glance, the award-winning sci-fi comic centers around a family on the run. But the storyline takes us where many other visual art forms have been too scared to go. It explores domestic abuse, race relations, drug use, trauma, and the complexities of marriage. And it's that willingness to confront the nitty-gritty of what makes us humanoids that prompted us to get in touch with Saga creator and writer Brian K. Vaughan. We asked him to take part in a one-off comics discussion in The Verge's New York office, and he agreed. The discussion that ensued is an exploration of comics, gaming, racial diversity, breastfeeding, Star Wars, and Vaughan's time as writer for the television show Lost. We had a blast talking to him, and we hope you'll enjoy listening to our conversation. But for those who might not be able to listen to an hour of audio right this minute, here's a snapshot of our favorite moments with Vaughan: ""you know, these characters don't have to be white."" ""Early on when I was describing the characters [to illustrator Fiona Staples], I said: 'oh, well, Alana the mom, has wings and Marko, the dad, has horns. And Alana can look however you want — I probably wouldn't make her a redhead because there's a glut of redheads in comics.' And Fiona sort of wisely pointed out, she said 'you know, these characters don't have to be white.'"" ""And I blame myself that, particularly when thinking about fantasy, that white tends to be the default when thinking about characters. And then it's sort of adding in horns and wings, or bumps on their foreheads makes them diverse, and I think it's insane. It was Fiona who pointed out, 'Look if you really do want to explore the real world, this book should look like the real world.'""   ""When the first issue came out, on the cover, it featured Alana breastfeeding Hazel in the most sort of muted, non-confrontational way possible, and still I was shocked to hear from Image that some stores were refusing to rack it on their shelves, or they would put a piece or paper over it, or turn them over. And, you know, if you've ever been in a comic book store, there are some pretty racy covers, just severed heads are par for the course. And so when it came time for us to do this collection, we just decided lets double down on this and have the most gigantic, in-your-face Hazel breastfeeding."" ""And, you know, I think it is definitely meant to illicit an emotional reaction. But I think it's also a warning for people. If that cover offends you, or if it's creepy or titillating, this series is not for you. But I think there are a lot of people who see it and think, 'Wow, what is this horned baby doing? I've never seen anything like this. This kind of weirdness is for me.'"" ""As a player, I love it. As a creator, I find it extremely challenging — that idea of giving the audience so much control over the story. I like to be much more dictatorial, and to take you on this path. So I admire games tremendously, and I would have no idea how to go about creating one.""   ""And that's actually something that has come up. A Saga video game, particularly if it's sort of about characters other than the main characters in our story, is really exciting to me — even more exciting than a film or TV show. So, uh, never say never."" ""I'm excited for the new Star Wars — I'll be first in line — but part of me is aching for... I hope my kids will get something new. You know, right now, we watch Marvel cartoons, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Star Wars, and it's all the same stuff that I liked as a kid.

While it's not clear what precise concerns prompted the studio to pull the film (Paramount declined to comment) we do know that Sony's release plans rapidly unraveled after hackers threatened physical violence on theater locations that showed The Interview. While releasing that film online could have allowed Sony to take a stand and also recoup some of its investment, the studio announced last night that it had no plans to release The Interview in any format whatsoever.

This discussion is, naturally, full of spoilers (and also caps-lock). Welcome to the Fellowship of the Hobbit. One (Kwame Opam) is a known stan; the other (Elizabeth Lopatto) hasn't read the books in a decade at least, and didn't see the other two Hobbit films. The Hobbit is about hiking and trying to stay out of troubleElizabeth Lopatto: So, I haven’t read The Hobbit in a while, but there are whole swaths of this movie I do not recall being in the book. In my memory, The Hobbit was about hiking and trying to stay out of trouble when trouble is all around you; I do not remember a two-hour fight scene. The conflict re: hiking / staying out of trouble made sense, because the main character is a hobbit. In a two-hour fight scene, the remarkably charming Martin Freeman is basically reduced to furrowing his brow and staying out of the way. Kwame Opam: Well, two things. First, you kind of have to already be on board for Peter Jackson stretching out said book about hiking and staying out of trouble to three long movies about a lot more than hiking and staying out of trouble. Which is to say, making The Hobbit mirror The Lord of the Rings. But you’re right, so much of what was in this movie was not in the book. People have been saying this for three years, but stretching the source material — which isn’t especially long to begin with — into three separate movies makes much of the trilogy feel unnecessary. This was probably the best entry in the trilogy, but after a long fight scene that felt like half the movie, I was exhausted. we don't need thorin's fever dreamsMartin Freeman was great, though. Lopatto: I loved him so much, I just wish he had more to do. There’s also the fact that, while Jackson’s been working on this, Game of Thrones raised the bar on narrative economy in fight scenes. That’s particularly clear with Kili’s (Aidan Turner) death scene — we don’t need so many reaction shots between him and Tauriel! It was like an opera, where a character gets stabbed but then sings an aria while dying. Or the weird gold fantasia moment in the middle. It was pretty, but it didn’t move the plot along. Opam: That was such a bizarre, trippy scene that took me out of the movie completely. We don’t need Thorin Oakenshield’s fever dreams! That’s the thing: The core story here is great because Tolkien told a great story. But everything else feels like padding. Do we really need to see Legolas take a jaunt to Gundabad for no reason? (I had to look that up just now — that’s how much it didn’t matter.) Actually, at this point we could make a pretty fair case for how useless Legolas is in this trilogy. Lopatto: 100% useless.     Some useless elves (The Hobbit) Opam: I do not care about his unrequited love for Tauriel. I do not care to watch him fight one orc for 20 minutes just to see Jackson flex his CG muscles. Give me Bilbo! Lopatto: FOR REAL. The name of the series is THE HOBBIT. So why am I watching so many goddamn elves? Also, who was Lee Pace supposed to be, besides ""problematic father figure"" for Legolas and Tauriel? Did he even have a name or title? Why was he there? Elven kings have the best eyebrowsOpam: Yeah, that’s Thranduil. He’s an elven king. Unrelated: the best tweet I saw about him after the movie was about how on point his eyebrows were. Lopatto: His eyebrows were great. I thought he was John Cusack for a minute. That’s how good they were. Opam: He’s a significant supporting character because he’s the ruler of the Mirkwood elves and he’s powerful. But the whole ""Legolas I am your father and you will heed me"" nonsense was just ugh. i can respect Jackson wanting to do world-buildingThe thing is, I can respect Jackson wanting to do world-building. I can respect that this is all meant to foreshadow the events in Lord of the Rings. This battle is significant because Sauron needs Erebor as a strategic stronghold, and that’s cool. I dig that. But the material is stretched so thin that it’s sometimes hard to figure out what actually matters before Jackson hits you over the head with his ""This is important in LOTR"" hammer. Lopatto: Jackson just hits you over the head with a hammer a lot! I felt like that at the beginning, where a child is cheaply used to ratchet up suspense / Smaug’s evilness. The cat in Gone Girl was more real than that kid, and it was a cat. And then there are all these unnecessary love triangles. Why? To make it more tragic when a likable character dies? Opam: That’s my biggest problem with Tauriel as a character. I can appreciate that there is a serious paucity of female characters in this franchise, but her biggest arc is falling in love with Kili, and all it boiled down to was her being sad for losing him. She became a love interest and lost someone she loved. I’ve seen this story play out. Lopatto: Although how could you not fall in love with Kili? Opam: Kili was awesome. His rage at Thorin was such a great moment. Lopatto: He’s a great character without Tauriel’s loss — the audience will mourn him, you don’t need to telegraph to us that he’s worth mourning. We like him! She also just… didn’t have a lot to do. Opam: Meanwhile, Cate Blanchett is over in the Dol Guldur slaying everything she touches.     Noted BAMF Galadriel (The Hobbit) Lopatto: I would like to talk about Cate Blanchett and elf fighting, because I have thoughts! A) If you suddenly can just slay a demon by going FULL ELF, why do the other elves not do this in battle? B) I am over women ""fighters"" who have ""power"" which is just like, glowing, and then going ""BOOM,"" and then crumpling? Boring. meanwhile cate blanchett is over in the dol guldur slaying everything she touchesOpam: Well, there’s a bunch of stuff going on here. Galadriel is supposed to be the greatest elf in Middle-earth. She has one of the three elven rings of power. So it makes sense that she was able to hold off Sauron and the nine dead kings. Trope-wise, she's this goddess figure who’s sort of removed from the rest of the action. But at least Tolkien was also willing to have characters like Eowyn who were fully developed and saw battle and did awesome things. Lopatto: Eowyn was exactly who I was thinking of. There’s such a huge difference between ""I AM NO MAN,"" followed by stabbing, and ""POOF LIGHT BOOM MAGIC ooh I’m tired."" Opam: Yeah, in that respect, Galadriel disappoints. But trust when I say she’s a BAMF. Lopatto: Also: what is the point of elves, does anyone know? They’re like vampires without blood-lust. Nothing drives them. They’re antithetical to plot! Lee Pace was into some jewelry I guess? what is the point of elves? does anyone know?Opam: Elves just are! They’re pretty, practically immortal, and will go to war when you need them. The tough thing about them is that they’re hardly relatable. Which is partly the point. They’re apart, but are in tune with deeper, unknowable things. Dwarves are mortal and have virtues we can identify with, just like what Bilbo said. Same with humans, same with hobbits. Lopatto: Right, and from a storytelling point of view, it seems weird to center elves as characters. They work best from the sidelines; as main characters, they feel like dead weight. Which I guess is why they get romantic plotlines? To give them literally anything to do?     Lee Pace, pictured with Lee Pace's eyebrows (The Hobbit) Lee Pace is great as this stately assholeOpam: Anything! Lee Pace is great as this stately asshole character, but he doesn’t do much else. This goes back to the worldbuilding problem, though: Jackson wanted far more than he could deliver with this trilogy. Truth be told, it’s not as though Elrond or even Legolas are THAT deep or relatable as characters on the page. They’re more representative of their races. Which worked for LOTR because it was more of a sweeping look at Middle-earth as a place at war centered around an ensemble cast. The Hobbit doesn’t really have that luxury of scope. Lopatto: My sense was that Jackson was so deep in this world that he forgot the basics of narrative. And while it kind of worked — I really want to go backpacking in New Zealand now! — it also kind of didn’t — because my main takeaway from the movie was not any emotional reaction. It was that I really want to go backpacking in New Zealand. Opam: I would LOVE to go backpacking through New Zealand. Lopatto: And ""WAR BATS."" That phrase occurs in my notes three times, in all caps every time. We went to a fortress for no reason except to learn that ""they were bred for war."" WAR BATS. Loved the WAR BATS. Opam: That scene is the epitome of what’s wrong with this movie. ""Let’s go see what’s happening at Gundabad."" 20 minutes later. ""We’re at Gundabad."" 20 minutes later. ""So we’re still at Gundabad. OMG WAR BATS. Time to go back."" Like, what? Lopatto: Right! If there’s no scene at Gundabad, you lose nothing. Jackson wanted to build Gundabad, so he did, and shoehorned it in. And as a viewer, that’s super frustrating. It felt like i paid to see an extended version of a much shorter movieOpam: It felt like I paid to see an extended version of a much shorter movie. Lopatto: This is George Lucas territory, you know? This movie felt as bloated and shaky as the Star Wars prequels. Perhaps with a smaller budget Peter Jackson would be forced to make movies that are for the audience instead of for himself. Opam: At this point, I am WAITING for some enterprising internet person to cut down all three of these movies to what’s essential. I bet you it’s maybe two movies, each an hour and a half long. Lopatto: It is one movie and it’s an hour and a half long. Opam: The crazy thing is the LOTR movies were super long. Return of the King has that long, climactic battle in Pelennor Fields. But it felt momentous. It had weight. You needed it to be there. Whereas in this movie, at some point I began wondering how anybody’s still alive after all this fighting. this movie has its own jar jar binks Lopatto: So I would just like to say: Alfrid Lickspittle was the movie’s Jar Jar Binks. Opam: I did not care about this idiot. Were we really meant to laugh at him in drag? Lopatto: Right, ha ha it is a man but he is in women’s clothing. It wasn’t even interesting drag, and he had such wonderful sparkly raw materials to work with. Gold coin sequins — guess he didn’t know how to sew! (I watch a lot of Drag Race.) But in those scenes, the drag’s a laugh only because it’s absurd for a man to dress as something ""lesser."" Opam: There were some actually funny moments, to be fair. Like the whole scene with Gandalf cleaning his pipe, after all the fighting was over. We needed a fucking break after all that, and Gandalf gave it to us. and the oscar for best pipe-cleaning goes to ian mckellenLopatto: Yes! And the auction sequence at the end. I liked that, too, perhaps because Martin Freeman was allowed to talk for so long, unimpeded by battle. Opam: There was good to this movie. There really was. Thorin’s fight with the pale orc, while super long, was thrilling. And I was moved when he died.     Thorin: the movie's MVP, pictured with titular hobbit Bilbo (The Hobbit) Lopatto: Thorin’s redemption was the real heart of the movie, and I was sad it wasn’t handled more deftly. Particularly since he manages to rally the dwarves once he loses his greed / dragon sickness, and really inspires his people to heroic feats. In the shorter version of this movie, that’s the climactic action, along with Bilbo’s line about the paucity of legends when it comes to remembering a friend. The moment Thorin decides to die to take out the orc leader is the true moment you know the dragon sickness lost its hold. It is selfless in the extreme. Opam: Thorin’s charge into battle gave me goosebumps. It reminded me of the Ride of the Rohirrim. At the end of the day, had the movie done a better job of telling a story about Bilbo and Thorin, it would have been a better movie. But at that point you’re necessarily asking for these movies to be shorter, more focused efforts. Lopatto: Yes. Again: worldbuilding run amok, and at the expense of a very good story.",0.27453631796279754,0.7254636820372025,0.14340319118393965,2230,4.5605381165919283,938,5.91044776119403,0,8,"Culture, Entertainment",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

According to Business Insider, Apple retail chief Angela Ahrendts has circulated a memo to store employees telling them to encourage customers to buy the Apple Watch and the new MacBook online, where more will be in stock. ""The days of waiting in line and crossing fingers for a product are over for our customers,"" the memo says. She later calls the shift to online sales, ""a significant change in mindset.""  ""The days of waiting in line and crossing fingers for a product are over for our customers."" The gist of the memo isn't simply that Apple's retail stores are going to have low supplies of these two new products, it's that Ahrendts is trying to make Apple's stores into something a bit classier. Apple has long gained publicity for having people wait in lengthy lines for hours — if not days — in front of its store for new iPhones. While that's generated a nice camaraderie for the brand, it certainly doesn't leave an impression of Apple as a high-end, classy fashion company. That's what Apple has been going for while selling the Watch, and that's the world Ahrendts comes from: her former position was CEO of Burberry. It's a strange shift, too, that seems to be transforming Apple Stores from actual stores into showrooms. It's unclear if this trend will continue with future product launches — we'll really see what Ahrendts is planning if this continues with the iPhone — but for now, Apple very much wants people to check out its new products in stores and then go home to buy them (and then wait for them to arrive). That could be frustrating if this practice continues months from now, when Apple's supply of the new products has stabilized, but it may make the devices' launches smoother and limit what resellers can grab. At the very least, killing lines will mean one less thing for Samsung to make fun of. While Apple Stores in the US will carry some supply of the Apple Watch, Business Insider reports that stores in the UK may not have any stock at all during launch. Watch try-ons and preorders begin this Friday. If you want one early, it sounds like you're best off ordering then. The full text of the memo, reprinted from Business Insider, is below.

Anyone who grew up in the 1980s probably knows of Bo Jackson. Unlike most professional athletes, Jackson played both baseball and football, managing to become an all-star in each. Nike even ran a very famous “Bo Knows” ad campaign pitching the idea that Jackson could do anything, which very well could have been the case if a football injury hadn't eventually slowed him down. Jackson’s popularity stemmed from the fact that it’s hard, and often downright impossible, to be that good at several things at once. And the same is often true with gadgets. But a new camera called the Flir FX is trying to do just that. It’s a home monitoring camera that can also be a GoPro-like action camera, dash cam for your car, or an outdoor security system — all depending on what kind of case you’ve inserted it into. The premise of the Flir FX seems to be that the guts of all these devices are basically the same, so why buy a completely different gadget for different types of activities?  That’s a pretty great take on how our electronics should serve us, though it comes with several major caveats — mostly that you end up having to spend more money on accessories to live that dream. Also, that removing your home security camera from your house means it’s no longer doing what you bought it for, and that there are inevitably compromises you’ll have to live with compared to dedicated gadgets for each type of activity. But more on that later. You might have heard the Flir name before from a $249.99 phone case the company has been shopping around that lets you see live thermal images with a special app. It was very neat, but arguably impractical for people who were not looking for temperature leaks around their house, or to reenact the best scenes from Predator. That phone case also wasn’t Flir’s first product. In fact, it’s a company that makes a good chunk of sales from very high-end camera systems that are used by the military, at airports, and at international borders. It’s also the same company that makes the Lorex brand of security cameras, which are mainly aimed at small businesses. All that is to say that this is not some new Kickstarter project from some unknown. What you get with the FX, which starts at $199 and goes up for preorders today, is a modular camera with 1080p resolution and a 160-degree viewing angle. Like other casual home monitoring cameras, it’s equipped with 802.11 b/g/n home Wi-Fi to stream video up into the cloud, a speaker and microphone for two-way conversations, and infrared LEDs that help it see about 30 feet in the dark. There's also a microSD card slot and an included 8GB memory card to store video when you're using it to capture footage on the go. Where things get interesting is that there's a built-in two-hour battery in both the camera and its detachable stand. Combined, that means you get about four hours of battery life and video recording if your power goes out. When it comes back on, the system automatically uploads that footage to the cloud, so you don’t have a gap in your recordings. You can also connect directly to the FX to download footage or change settings when it’s running off batteries alone. Flir has built in a fairly simple way to trigger what gets recorded and what doesn’t, using a mix of  sound, temperature, and motion alerts. Using the Flir FX app for iOS or Android (which is currently the only way to set up and view footage until a web viewer is released later this year), you can check off the boxes you want to track motion in, like doors, windows, or specific objects in your house. Flir’s system is not as advanced as Dropcam’s, which lets you create multiple zones using such a system, each of which can have their own alert rules.  Flir’s unique features over Dropcam and others are optional weatherproofing and a video replay tool called RapidRecap. The weatherproofing can be had with a special outdoor case that either runs as a $79.99 accessory, or as part of a $249 camera bundle. This can be mounted outside and adds special infrared LEDs that let the camera see 65 feet (up from the 33 feet you get with the built-in lights). RapidRecaps are all the activity that’s been captured over the course of several hours — or even an entire day — overlaid at once, with timestamps. This means you don’t actually need to watch the entire recording to see comings and goings. Instead, it’s presented in a bizarre, ghost-like experience where people, cars, and pets move around and through each other with little floating timestamps. You can use this information to jump to that particular video snippet, and see it separate of everything else. The idea behind RapidRecaps are really to act as triage for long recordings with people or motion in them, but it takes some work to make them. And how RapidRecaps actually help you surveil your home in realtime is questionable. Tools in competing products like facial recognition in ArcSoft’s Simplicam or Dropcam’s people detection seem like better solutions, alerting you to things as soon as they’re happening. In the case of RapidRecaps, you need to create them from a special menu inside of Flir’s app, which lets you pick what time of the day you want to view. Then it takes a few minutes to churn through the footage far away on a server farm before you can see it back in the app. It would be better if it was something constantly being produced that you could go back and check when you wanted. If there is one reason to go with Flir over the likes of Dropcam and Simplicam though, it’s the free cloud recording with alerts. Flir is doling out a generous two days of free cloud recordings as part of its Flir Cloud service. You don’t have to use this to operate the FX, but it’s nice to have. And to be perfectly clear, this is not two full days of around the clock footage that’s being uploaded —  just every motion or sound event that’s been recorded. Those who need more can upgrade to a seven- and 30-day plan for $9.99/month or $99.95/year and $19.99/month or $199.95/year respectively, which is $100 less than Dropcam on the high-end plan. Besides the extra recording time, the paid plans also increase the number of RapidRecap videos you can create, how long those videos can span, and how long they’re stored. (The free plan allows for three RapidRecap videos.) All this is fine when comparing the FX to the Dropcam, but the FX promises to fill the role of two other gadgets: an action camera and a camera for your dashboard. Yet buying the FX to use specifically for those two activities is less compelling. For one, you’ll need to buy a sport case or dash suction mount which sell as $69.99 and $49.99 add-ons. Even with the cost of the camera, that ends up being cheaper than a high-end GoPro, but you don’t get as many features as even its lowest-end model, including a wealth of mounts and better quality video. It’s a different story if you’re in the market for a dash cam, where you’re arguably just as well off using your mobile phone, since you’re probably not going to want to leave a $248.99 gadget sitting unattended if you park somewhere. But most importantly: using the Flir FX outside your house means it’s no longer useful as a security camera, which is where most of its best features lie. Do all these shortcomings make the Flir FX a bad idea? No. But it’s hard to imagine a scenario where using this outside of your house would be preferable to more specialized gadgets. Perhaps the only one is for people who might want to buy an action camera like a GoPro that’s useful for times when they’re not on vacation. What you’re not getting is the Bo Jackson — something that is the best of each of those categories. At least not yet. In the meantime, this is a very attractive product if you’ve been in the market for something like a Dropcam, but want something that can transform into something else when you inevitably change your mind.",0.6390905896229416,0.36090941037705837,0.18517054297517396,1425,4.6694736842105264,629,5.9697933227344988,0,4,"Home, Tech, Hands-on",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The upcoming G4, which is three weeks away from its official launch, will feature a lens with an f/1.8 aperture, making it that little bit wider than the f/1.9 lens on Samsung's impressive Galaxy S6. The smaller the F number, the more light that a camera can take in with any one shot, allowing the photographer to shoot at a faster shutter speed and thus capture more challenging photos without unsightly motion blur. That's the technical premise, but in the world of cameraphones, wide apertures haven't always been guarantees of great imagery, as evidenced by the f/2.0 lens on the maligned HTC One M8 camera. Samsung only just reclaimed the undisputed title of best Android phone, but a challenger is already incoming LG won't be the first to offer a smartphone with an f/1.8 camera, having been beaten to the feat by Acer, Lenovo, and others. Nonetheless, imaging has been a strength for LG at least since 2013's G2, and the most recent G3 and G Flex 2 have extended what's growing into a fine pedigree for the Korean company. Judging from today's teaser, the focus with the G4 appears to be on low-light photography, which will definitely benefit from the large aperture. Whether it will be better than Samsung's superb new smartphones, though, will be a matter to be settled by practical experience rather than numerical comparison. LG is starting to ramp up its teaser campaign for the G4, and has posted another video highlighting the new phone's user interface. It promises to be simpler to use, yet smarter in predicting user behavior. Having introduced a stripped-down Simple Mode for the camera in its previous iteration, LG UX 4.0 will now add a Manual Mode that ""makes you into a professional photographer.""

Docking delayed from Saturday to Sunday, possibly even longer Fortunately for the company, Dragon probably won't have to wait that long. The spacecraft was able a perform a critical engine burn on Friday afternoon, raising its orbit enough to stop it from re-entering Earth prematurely and putting it on a trajectory to reach the station. NASA and SpaceX still need to review the data of what went wrong before SpaceX is allowed to approach the station, however. If SpaceX can't get Dragon to the space station in a month, it will have to return to Earth along with all the cargo it's carrying, which includes science experiments and noncritical supplies. In that case, SpaceX would also receive only partial payment from NASA on its $1.6 billion contract for 12 cargo flights. This mission was supposed to be Dragon's third flight to the space station and its second cargo flight. Dragon could stay in orbit for up to a month Dragon's troubles began Friday after it reached orbit and disconnected from the Falcon 9 rocket. SpaceX observed lower-than-expected pressure readings in Dragon's oxidizer tanks, preventing the company from turning on all four of the spacecraft's thruster pods, which are necessary for making an approach to the space station.  ""We think it was essentially a glitch of some kind, not a serious thing,"" Musk said. At first, SpaceX was only able to activate two thrusters, but as of Friday at 4:04 PM ET, all four thrusters had successfully been turned on, according to NASA. SpaceX is still tracing the root cause of the problem, which Musk speculated could be caused by ice or some other blockage.

The cause of the corrupted memory is still uncertain, but Space.com reports that the memory may have been damaged by cosmic rays — radiation that originates in space.

In its press release, NASA said the discovery would require ""rewriting textbooks.""     ""The third belt persisted beautifully, day after day."" The finding was made possible by two identical satellites packed with high-precision instruments called the Van Allen Probes, which NASA launched in August of last year. But the exciting discovery would not have been made if the researchers hadn’t rushed to power up the Relativistic Electron Proton Telescope (REPT) ahead of schedule. By skipping past the ordinary checks and turning it on just three days after launch, the team was able to get observations that overlapped with those of another mission called SAMPEX, which was scheduled to end shortly thereafter. After switching on the REPT, the third belt was visible from just five days of observations, said Shri Kanekal, deputy mission scientist for the Van Allen Probes.

""These experiments showed that we have established a sophisticated, direct communication linkage between brains,"" said the project's leader Miguel Nicolelis, a neurobiologist at Duke University, in a statement released Thursday. He and his colleagues at Duke and ELS-IINN , a Brazilian neuroscience institute, constructed what they say is the first working ""brain-to-brain"" interface by surgically implanting electrodes in the brains of two groups of rats and wiring them into computers. The rat brain signals traveled through the wire, into the computer and then out and back into another rat's brain. The news comes just days after a video was posted of Nicolelis's TED talk on how he was able to use the brain signals of a rhesus monkey to control a robotic avatar.     ""Direct communication linkage between brains.""     For this new study, Nicolelis and his colleagues ran several experiments to see if the rats in one group, called ""decoders,"" could process and respond to the sights and sense of touch originally experienced by the other group of rats, called ""encoders."" In one experiment, scientists trained both groups of rats to press a lever after they saw an LED light over it, rewarding them with a drink of water. But because the rats were linked, even when the light wasn't shining in the cage of a decoder rate, or when there were multiple lights shining, it would still push on the right lever about 70 percent of the time that its counterpart in the encoder group pushed the right lever. The first working 'brain-to-brain' interface In another experiment designed to test if tactile, or touch-based information could be shared over the system, the rats were all trained to use their whiskers to judge the width of a hole in front of them, poking their nose to the left if it was narrow and to the right if it was wide, also receiving water as a reward for the correct choice. Then the rats in the encoder were put in front of the hole while the rats in decoder group were not. Yet again, in about 65 percent of the tests, the rats in the decoder group were able to accurately judge the hole size from the encoder rats' brain signals. When they did, both sets of rats received a reward, encouraging them to work together across the neural network. In a final test of their system, the researchers linked one rat at Duke in North Carolina to another in Natal, Brazil, and found the rats were able to successfully complete the hole measuring test. The scientists reported on their success in the journal Nature Scientific Reports, and said that their concept could lead to even greater advances in cooperative cognition. ""We cannot even predict what kinds of emergent properties would appear when animals begin interacting as part of a brain-net,"" Nicolelis said in a statement.

In a 43-8 vote, the council passed a bill expanding the city's public smoking ban to e-cigarettes, meaning that they won't be allowed in public places like bars, subways, or parks. The council has been debating the measure since late November, with e-cigarette opponents saying they just wanted to close a loophole in New York's stringent anti-smoking laws. They say allowing e-cigarettes but not their traditional counterparts causes confusion, and that children aren't able to tell the difference, leading them to see smoking as socially acceptable. And this isn't the only smoking crackdown of the winter: last month, New York became the first major city to raise the smoking age from 18 to 21. While e-cigarettes, which rely on flavored nicotine juice rather than tobacco and flame, were only introduced to the US a few years ago, sales have grown quickly, becoming a $1.7 billion market — though that's still dwarfed by the $90 billion market in cigarettes. Supporters say that they provide a safer alternative to cigarettes, and that the vapor they produce isn't comparable to secondhand smoke — making a ban unfair and potentially counterproductive. ""If you make it just as inconvenient to use an electronic cigarette as a tobacco cigarette, people are just going to keep smoking their Marlboros,"" said NJoy e-cigarette company head Craig Weiss when the bill was introduced. However, there's no definitive answer on precisely how safe e-cigarettes are and how they should be regulated. A 2009 FDA study tested several varieties of cartridge and found carcinogenic substances in most of them, banning them for ""therapeutic"" purposes like quitting smoking but leaving non-therapeutic sales open. This year, it took another look at the issue and is currently working on proposed rules to bring e-cigs under its regulatory umbrella; the EU, meanwhile, rejected a proposal to regulate them as medicines in October. In addition to any federal rules, two other major cities — Los Angeles and Chicago — are considering public bans on e-cigarettes.",0.3245416125318147,0.6754583874681853,0.8515905157552236,349,5.2492836676217767,241,6.0414937759336098,0,0,"Policy & Law, US & World",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

Data covering January to June of 2013 shows a total of 3,846 orders or requests from governments to remove information, covering 24,737 pieces of data worldwide. Numbers have been growing steadily since Google started publishing the report in 2010; in the last half of 2012, it received 2,289 requests to remove 24,191 blogs, videos, or other pieces of information. Turkey's harsh online and offline crackdown on protestors in 2013 made it the most censorious country: courts and officials sent 1,673 takedowns of over 12,000 items, the largest number by far. Google says it ended up removing around 200 items from Google+, Blogger, Search, and YouTube. Russia's internet filtering law, which went into effect in late 2012, also pushed its numbers higher, with an increase of 125 percent since the last report and a total of 257 requests for 277 pieces of data; last year, it asked for only 114 takedowns. But in total requests, it didn't come close to topping the US, which sent 545 requests for 3,887 takedowns. 'Innocence of Muslims' fallout continued into 2013 The report breaks these numbers down into official court orders and executive or law enforcement requests, which adds another layer to the numbers: Russia, for example, sends vanishingly few court orders, while in the US, they make up the clear majority of requests. The reasons, likewise, vary. In some countries, an event or a new law is a major factor; in others, it's an ongoing tug of war between users and governments. Many of the requests that Google singles out for discussion involve officials or politicians attempting to get criticism or negative content about them removed: in Brazil, for example, various to remove a total of several hundred allegedly defamatory blogs that accused mayors, judges and officials of corruption and other offenses. Google says that nearly all of these claims were rejected. There was also continuing fallout from ""Innocence of Muslims,"" a virulently anti-Islam YouTube film that Google has blocked in some countries after protests and court orders. Upticks in bad behavior by netizens or suppression by governments isn't the only explanation for higher numbers: if Google's user base in a country increases, there's going to be more content to review and potentially take down.

Today, in a world of iPhones and smartwatches, it looks out of date. In his two terms as president, Barack Obama has led the nation during the mass consumer adoption of the internet. His victories at the ballot have largely been credited to an army of nerds who drove his tech-savvy campaigns with talent from Twitter, Facebook, and Google. It was Harper Reed and ""Narwhal"" that took down Mitt Romney and ""Orca"" — not merely a campaign ad that was more clever than the other guy’s.  Obama's nerds are marching in the wrong direction Today, Obama’s cunning campaign looks like an anomaly in the face of two gargantuan failures: Healthcare.gov and the monstrosity of NSA spying. When the nerds marched in to build Healthcare.gov, they didn’t come from Google or Facebook; they came from Canadian firm CGI Federal and dozens of other insider contractors. When the nerds of the NSA marched under legacy orders from President Bush, Obama renewed their mission and even expanded their intrusive, unprecedented surveillance of American citizens and efforts to crack the security measures that ensure privacy for everyone on the internet. These aren’t superficial matters; once we begin to start administering our laws electronically, the systems of administration will effectively enforce the limits of our freedom. With the internet now a staple in the lives of millions of citizens, our government can’t remain behind the curve. The president, of course, is just one man. Not all of the technological failures can be attributed to Obama, and they probably shouldn’t be; perception of the president’s power has arguably exceeded the office’s authority by a vast margin as the scope of the executive branch has expanded over the past century. Healthcare.gov — the massive system which was supposed to be a primary expression of Obama’s landmark Affordable Care Act — was mired by a nightmarish federal IT procurement system that the president inherited along with years of Republican efforts to derail implementation of the ACA. And the intelligence community’s unprecedented, expansive spying programs were already snowballing from the days of 9/11 and the Patriot Act. But that won’t keep the public, or Obama’s opponents, from holding the deep technology problems of his second term over his head for the remainder of his presidency and beyond. The president can’t blame all his failures on preexisting conditions. The president can't blame his failure on preexisting conditions The administration seems to think of technology the way consumers do — a commodity that can easily be bought. In November, Obama said he wouldn’t have launched Healthcare.gov if he had known it wasn’t going to work, but that’s ultimately a poor excuse; Obama was responsible for the incoherent management mess that didn’t understand how to develop a website or to see the red flags along the way. In the years following passage of the ACA, no single person was responsible for Healthcare.gov’s development. Instead, responsibilities for managing the project and its 55 contractors were spread across several agencies and deputies who weren’t focused on the site’s development full-time. Imagine a handful of Google engineers trying to build Android from the ground up in their spare time. The president’s decision to delay certain crucial policy measures for political reasons also impacted the process, leaving the engineers without the specifications they needed to build a fully functional site until the final hours. That kind of ragtag approach might work if you’re building a campaign website, but not when you’re building a massive health-care exchange that millions of Americans must rely upon. To fix the site the president called for a ""tech surge,"" drawing an unfortunate comparison to another surge that also didn’t turn out well for the US. The Healthcare.gov surge added workers at all levels, expanding an already bloated project. ""‘Tech surge’ is just a couple buzzwords thrown together,"" a source familiar with CGI Federal told The Verge in an email. More than two months after launch and an estimated $600 million in development costs, the website still faces problems. The companies Obama is now enlisting to help fix the health-care site — America’s technological brain trust — are starting to turn their backs on him. On Tuesday, at a White House meeting meant to get recommendations on Healthcare.gov from giants like Yahoo’s Marissa Mayer, Netflix’s Reed Hastings, and Google’s Eric Schmidt, executives reportedly steered the conversation towards government spying. Obama wanted to talk about the insurance site. ""That is not going to happen,"" one executive reportedly said. ""We are there to talk about the NSA."" Yahoo, Google, Apple, Microsoft, Facebook, and others have filed lawsuits or supported briefs against NSA surveillance, and last week a coalition of major tech companies sent an open letter to the White House demanding reform. ""Yes we scan."" It’s not clear how Obama ended up supporting the intelligence community’s massive, questionable programs. As a senator and presidential candidate, Obama encouraged prudence and caution when it came to laws like the Patriot Act, but as president, Obama has extended Bush’s legacy of spying. Obama may not have been able to predict that a single contractor would leak the nature of NSA spying to the world, but that he enabled them in secret is arguably more concerning. As commander in chief, there’s little argument that the NSA’s programs are directly Obama’s responsibility. While the White House has denied knowledge of some of the agency’s programs, like spying on the personal phones of world leaders, the president has defended the most controversial programs which indiscriminately surveil American citizens. Obama’s initial defense of the NSA’s programs may bite him in the long run now that congressional opposition is mounting, and since a federal court has just found for the first time that the government’s dragnet phone surveillance program is likely unconstitutional. Any president’s second term is effectively far shorter than four years; with midterm elections and the natural abatement of political power, presidents famously become ""lame ducks,"" sometimes long before their tenure ends. According to some wonks, Obama’s second term could meaningfully be up as soon as next year. If he can’t deliver on Healthcare.gov or NSA reform by then, the president’s legacy could already be sealed. If Obama’s technology legacy has a lesson, it’s that the government can’t waste any more time transitioning to the internet age. It must learn how to quickly and efficiently utilize technology to carry out the nation’s laws, and know enough not to willfully break it. It’s time for Obama to ditch his BlackBerry. We can’t afford another presidency that learns the hard way.",0.3536022864503794,0.6463977135496206,0.853878878878851,1125,5.3600000000000003,606,6.5445544554455441,0,0,"Culture, Policy & Law, Tech, US & World, Editorial",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

But it's probably cheaper to do that than to clean up after a massive leak like this one. ""Why not give me the opportunity to finish and give you my very best?""According to Madonna, though, the leaks are ""unfinished demos stolen long ago and not ready to be presented to the world."" At least, that's what she said on Instagram. She followed up with an Instagram post that deemed the leaks ""artistic rape,"" and said — sic, obviously — ""These are early leaked demo's half of which wont even make it on my album the other half have changed and evolved. This is a form of terrorism."" I am of the opinion that rape is rape and terrorism is terrorism; the leaks are just intellectual property theft. No matter how hurt she may feel, conflating these things is not especially helpful. Madonna does ask one good question, though: ""Why not give me the opportunity to finish and give  you my very best?"" This isn't the first leak from Madonna this year. In November, a clip of a new song called ""Rebel Heart,"" hit the internet. Afterwards, her manager, Guy Oseary, tweeted the following: I would be grateful to any @madonna fans that can assist us in finding those responsible for the leak.. We appreciate your help..

The internet is not just the best option - now it’s the only one. The dominoes fell swiftly Tuesday. The group behind the massive Sony hacks released another cache of confidential information, threatening violence against movie theaters that dare play the Seth Rogen and James Franco comedy The Interview. Soon both actors canceled the rest of their promotional appearances for the film, and Sony told theater chains that it ""wouldn’t object"" if they chose to drop the film due to safety concerns. Carmike Cinemas was the first company to take Sony up on its offer, with Landmark Theatres calling off the movie’s New York premiere hours later. As an event, it’s unprecedented: a cyberattack has rocked a major corporation in the most public of ways, and is now dictating the release of a major motion picture in the United States. And yet the studio still has one card tucked in its back pocket. Sony should release The Interview online. Right now. Threats of violence can't be taken lightly by theater owners Almost from the beginning the hacks have been about stopping people from seeing the movie. It’s such a bizarre tactic that if the stakes were lower you’d almost think it was an elaborate PR stunt — the kind of thing that would fit right in with a story about a TV personality recruited to kill the leader of North Korea. But threats of physical violence can’t be taken lightly, not by theater owners worried about legal liabilities nor by Sony Pictures itself. This is a post-9/11, post-Aurora America, and frankly a movie premiere being attacked doesn’t sound all that implausible. So while it’s tempting to flip a jingoistic middle finger and chant ""We won’t let the terrorists win!"" the realities of huge corporations looking out for their own best interests is another matter. Does it smack of censorship and impinging of free speech? Absolutely — though what it feels like most is the conservative choice. Hollywood loves a safe bet, and Sony making the passive move to let theaters opt out at their leisure is as safe as it gets, no matter what creative voices get stifled. Of course, the film industry has always been more about business than it has been about creative expression anyway, and in that sense The Interview can simply be framed as fallout from a bad business decision: Sony Pictures decided to make a movie about killing a real-world dictator, and is suffering immeasurably as a result.   Every living room, computer, and phone can be a movie theater But it’s foolish for anybody — even the hackers themselves — to think that The Interview will simply disappear, or that a movie’s life begins and ends at your local multiplex. Things leak. They spread. A version of Kim Jong-un’s death scene is already out in the wild. So what Sony should really do is take the game online. Throw the movie up on iTunes and Amazon. Get crazy and give Crackle a shot. Take the threat of attacking theaters and diffuse it with the truth that the hackers don’t seem to understand: we live in a world where every living room, every computer, and every phone is a theater. And whether it’s leaked government documents or a goofy comedy from the Neighbors guy, nothing stays hidden for long. Would it open Sony up to having additional emails leaked? Would it open up content providers to potentially adding their names to the hackers' hitlist? Potentially, and we certainly don’t know what other personal threats have been made directly to the heads of Sony Pictures. But anyone expecting the leaks to stop at this point hasn’t been paying attention, and as long as the movie is kept under wraps there’s that dangling, implied threat: don’t show it or else. Releasing the movie online would allow the company to take a principled stand against its attackers and shatter that tension. Releasing it for free would bring a bonanza of good will Releasing it for free would bring a bonanza of good will at a time when the studio needs it, but charging could be an even stronger choice, serving as a bold experiment in day-and-date video-on-demand releases. For years studios, theaters, and VOD services have butted heads over narrowing theatrical windows and release strategies: theaters want to have movies longer, while studios want to start collecting that VOD money as soon as possible. With many theaters already dropping out, why not take the most dangerous studio movie in the world and let audiences decide what they prefer? Make it a premium rental, even; I’d certainly pony up to see The Interview from the comfort of my home, even if it just turns out to be the goofy bro-com it appears to be. This is a scenario unlike anything we’ve ever seen before, and Sony Pictures is at a unique point in history. As theater chain stocks dipped Tuesday, the hacks began to look more like true economic terrorism — impacting an entire industry, not just a lone company. TV shows and movies will undoubtedly stay away from portraying North Korea in a negative light moving forward, the chilling effect that this kind of strong-arming leads to. And what happens between now and Christmas Day, when the film is (still) scheduled for release, will establish a precedent that sets the tone for years to come. The hackers, whomever they may be, have used the internet to attack Sony Pictures. They’ve used it to intimidate Sony Pictures. Now Sony can use that same internet to fight back and spread The Interview across the world.

Kilar, the company's longtime CEO, had built it into an online powerhouse for premium video, backed by Tom, his chief technical officer. Nearly as soon as they left, the duo decided to try it again. Vessel, which is opening its doors to video creators today, is yet another premium video service. But instead of serving mass-market television and movies, as most of them do, Vessel will show you your favorite web video series a few days before you can see them anywhere else. When Vessel starts selling subscriptions early next year, you'll pay $2.99 a month for access to everything on its site and mobile apps. ""A missing piece in the ecosystem"" The idea goes something like this: YouTube, the main home for web stars, takes around 45 percent of the ad revenues generated by their videos. That has left a lot of them restless and looking for other ways to make money. Meanwhile, the biggest stars have millions of fans who will follow them anywhere — and might even pay to get an advance look at their work. ""I very much look at this as a missing piece in the ecosystem,"" Kilar says. People pay a premium to see movies in a theater, he says, and they'll soon pay a premium to watch the most anticipated web videos on day one. Videos posted to Vessel won't be available anywhere else for at least 72 hours, and creators can make the window longer if they like. ""It's fundamental human nature to want things early,"" Kilar says. ""The movie theater business is a massive success based on 3 to 4 percent of Americans going to theaters this weekend."" For now, you can't watch videos on Vessel. Instead, the company is courting people who regularly make high-quality videos on the web and show them to large audiences, primarily on YouTube. Early next year, once it has rounded up enough of them to make its subscription offer compelling, it will open to the public. In addition to the subscription service, there will be a free offering that aggregates videos from sites like CollegeHumor and Funny Or Die. (Those videos will be posted on Vessel the same time they appear everywhere else.)   Vessel has already signed up big networks like Machinima and Tastemade; YouTube stars like Shane Dawson, Marcus Butler, and Ingrid Nilsen; A&E Networks; and music videos from Warner Music Group. Vessel says that 1,000 views make the average YouTube star $2.20; on Vessel, 1,000 views will net $50. That's made possible by giving creators 60 percent of subscription revenues, and 70 percent of ad revenues. That's right: ad revenue. As on Hulu, paying for a premium experience doesn't get rid of advertising. Every video will be preceded by a 5-second spot; and some will get a 15- or even 30-second pre-roll ad. Kilar insists it won't feel overwhelming. ""I'm very sensitive to ad overload and tone-deaf ad execution — this is not that,"" he says. The 5-second ads will all be custom-made for Vessel, and Kilar says they're long enough to make an impression but short enough that they don't ""feel like a tax."" Kilar is the first to admit that the service isn't for everyone. And if you don't follow many creators on YouTube, the appeal may escape you entirely. But audiences on YouTube are huge — PewDiePie, the No. 1 creator, has more than 32 million subscribers — and luring even 5 percent of them to Vessel could double their revenue. (Vessel encourages creators to continue posting their videos on YouTube and wherever else they like, once the preview period has elapsed.) Google is worried There are a few big unknowns about Vessel. The biggest is how YouTube will react. The Wall Street Journal has reported that the Google-owned company is ""particularly concerned"" about Vessel, and has moved aggressively to sign its biggest stars to new deals that make their content exclusive to YouTube for a certain window of time. Vessel will only work if big web stars post their videos there, and while the company has raised $75 million to lure them over, it will still struggle to compete with Google's pocketbook. There's also a more practical concern — what's to stop all these fanatical teens from ripping Vessel videos and immediately posting them to free sites? I put the question to the company several times, and it didn't respond. We won't have any answers until Vessel starts selling subscriptions. In the meantime, its team has built a slick, beautiful product that creators used to YouTube will likely love. And their subscribers might, too, if they can get over the purchase price. ""We didn't engineer this for the ambivalent consumer,"" Kilar says. ""We built this for the fan.""",0.48105324193664256,0.5189467580633574,0.19929980780031933,816,4.7990196078431371,437,5.7276887871853548,0,2,"Apps, Culture, Entertainment, Tech, Report",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

In a bid to explain the new and somewhat complex system, Snapchat sensibly illustrates it using pictures of Beyoncé. Receive a snap from the person you message the most, and if they are also your best friend, you'll see a heart. If your friend sends you the highest percentage of their snaps, but you have another best friend, you'll see a side-eyed smirk.

Other emoji are detailed inside the app itself, the only place the silent update was officially announced.   Unlike the original ""best friends"" list, Snapchat's new emoji friendship brackets aren't public, to the annoyance of users who kept tabs on friends and significant others by seeing who they were snapping with. Another new bracket has been introduced with this update, too — friends you haven't snapped with in a while will fall under the ""Needs Love"" banner, a bid to get you snapping with acquaintances to turn your buddy into a BFF, scoring Snapchat more engaged users along the way.

Samsung says its internal figures have found that the force typically generated when a person ""presses the back pocket,"" whatever that means, is around 66lbf.   Can we please be done with this now? ""Our internal test results indicate that the Samsung Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge are not bendable even under 79lbf, which is equivalent to putting pressure to snap a bundle of five pencils at once,"" Samsung said in its blog post. And yes, you'll see those pencils broken in half in the company's own bend test video. ""It isn't easy to break four pencils at once. Breaking five is even harder,"" the video astutely points out. In the clip, Samsung subjects the S6 to the force that it specified, though never goes far enough to permanently bend or destroy its own smartphone.   Samsung is also apparently displeased that SquareTrade only tested the S6 Edge with the screen facing up. ""Some smartphones have different durability in each the front and back sides respectively,"" the company wrote. ""SquareTrade has only tested the front side, which may mislead consumers about the entire durability of smartphones.""

""There are millions more just like it,"" said William Cooke, lead scientist at NASA's Meteoroid Environment Office, in a post about the meteor's origins on NASA's Science website published Tuesday. Cooke and other NASA scientists believe the Russian meteor came from the main asteroid belt, a donut-shaped ring of asteroids, most of which are located between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. Above, a  NASA diagram showing the asteroid belt relative to Earth's orbit (blue) and that of Mars (red) and Jupiter (purple). The red dots are those asteroids that pass close to Earth. Thousands of these asteroids cross into Earth's orbit, but not all are a danger: NASA recently released a survey from its infrared WISE space telescope estimating there are about 4,700 of these near-Earth asteroids that are ""potentially hazardous,"" or large enough to survive entering the planet's atmosphere and capable of doing damage. Unfortunately, only 20 to 30 percent of these had been found as of the middle of 2012. NASA estimates 4,700 potentially hazardous asteroids Separately, two scientists in Colombia used publicly available dashcam and security camera footage of the recent Russian meteor fragments streaking through the sky to pinpoint its origin in a specific group of about 240 near-Earth asteroids known as the Apollo family. That could mean it was a close cousin of the last big meteor to impact Earth, the Tunguska meteor, which also impacted Russia back in 1908 and has been traced back to the same asteroid grouping. The Colombian analysis noted that the 2013 meteor fragmented into many pieces when it entered Earth's atmosphere, including a large one that is thought to have left a hole in the ice on a lake in Russia's Ural Mountains near the city Chelyabinsk. Locals and tourists have been scouring the area nearby to try and find the fragments, with some success.

To solve the problem, researchers at Italy’s National Institute of Optics have come up with a technique that one-ups conventional infrared camera technology by ditching an optical lens in favor of a laser, using infrared light to build a clear picture of what’s happening inside. The results were published in Optics Express.  Scientists were able to build a holographic model of someone standing past the fire If you were to look inside a burning building through the lens of an ordinary thermographic camera, radiation from the flames could completely obscure anything inside, making it difficult or impossible to confirm if anyone needs rescuing. In their experiments, the scientists were able to build a holographic model of someone standing past the fire by shining infrared laser light inside the room, then combining the scattered laser light bouncing back out with light from a reference beam. The resulting interference pattern was then decoded to build a hologram. The images can be processed quickly enough to create a nearly real-time video  The big advantage over conventional thermographic cameras is that because the light hitting the sensor is unfocused, even if some of the sensor’s pixels are saturated by the radiation from the flames, an image can still be reassembled from what’s left over. Sample a couple of times and combine everything with numerical methods, and you can get a remarkably sharp image, like the ones pictured above right. The researchers say that the images can even be processed quickly enough to create a nearly real-time video of a burning room’s interior. And the same principle also works to see through smoke — the soot particles in the air hardly scatter the IR light, thanks to its long wavelength.  The team says that its infrared digital holographic (IRDH) system could be mounted on a tripod, giving first responders a live view of what’s happening inside a burning building, and that IR light's long wavelength makes hologram recording resistant to vibrations —  an important consideration outside the laboratory. In the paper's introduction, the researchers point out that US fire departments respond to about 1.6 million fire calls a year, mostly domestic house fires, resulting in some 3,000 deaths. They are hopeful that their findings ""can open a route for making an imaging technique available that is able to see through fire and possibly to give a completely new chance for saving human lives.""",0.7218428757958385,0.2781571242041615,0.18595376469407854,436,5.1123853211009171,244,6.1065573770491799,0,0,Science,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Scientists who receive funding from the government to study these deadly agents are required to come up with a ""risk mitigation plan,"" outlining how they will reduce risk of their research results being used to harm the public. Scientists must report such research to the federal agencies that fund them, or to the National Institutes of Health if there is no federal funding source. The White House has opened the broader policy to public comment over the next two months, but NIH director Francis Collins seems confident that it's the right approach, issuing a statement saying ""the policy aims to preserve the benefits of life sciences research while minimizing the risk of misuse."" Outside of the lab, bird flu remains a persistent problem, with a new case reported on a farm in Germany just this month.

Some of these challenges include traditional space risks like radiation, muscle and bone deterioration, and psychological issues like depression. But the project's backers and partners are optimistic that success is a possibility; Jane Poynter, president of the Paragon Space Development Corporation, said that ""this entire thing is possible because it's actually a very simple mission. We're not trying to land, we're going to fly by and we're using extant technologies that NASA and the space industry have been developing for years.""  ""It's actually a very simple mission."" However, while some technologies may already exist to help propel the project, details provided by Wired indicate that the journey won't be quite like the one traditional astronauts have experienced before. For instance, Paragon estimates the mission would involve a 10-ton spacecraft mostly filled with mechanical systems and supplies; as Wired notes, that means two people would have to live in an area ""barely bigger than a parking space"" for 501 days. An initial feasibility study is said to have excluded considerations for privacy, separate sleeping quarters, or showers. It's easy to imagine the serious difficulties such conditions would present even for willing human beings with perfect health. The mission also faces logistical and financial challenges that could preclude it from launching on-time. (And timeliness is essential — if the deadline is missed the mission won't be possible again until 2031 due to the positions of Earth and Mars.) Wired reports that there's no launch vehicle yet that can carry the heavy craft into space; the project will depend on SpaceX's Falcon Heavy rocket to be made on time for a cost-effective solution. And while the project is said to cost less than NASA's $2.5 billion Curiosity rover mission, the project's founder has only committed to funding the first two years of mission development and will require the help of other funders.  The Inspiration Mars Foundation mission, spearheaded by American entrepreneur and space tourist Dennis Tito, joins several other recently announced private space ventures, including companies aiming for asteroid mining and a reality TV show of a colony on Mars.

Like Darpa for energy research ""This private capital will allow these companies to further their technologies and map pathways to the market,"" said Cheryl Martin, deputy director of ARPA-E, the division of the Energy Department in charge of the investments, in her keynote speech at a conference in Washington, DC on Tuesday. ARPA-E was launched just four years ago by President Obama with a $400 million starting budget. It's modeled after the Defense Department's future military-tech focused arm DARPA, which spawned the prototype of the Internet back in the late 1960s. Since its founding, ARPA-E has invested $770 million in some 285 early-stage energy projects, but winning private backers is key to proving that alternative energy is viable from a business perspective, not just because the government supports it. That's why at its fourth-annual energy innovation summit this week, which ends tomorrow, ARPA-E highlighted how its initial investment of $70 million in 17 projects in particular has paid off, with private backers pouring in $450 million of their own funds. The 17 projects that have won private funds so far include a range of new energy technologies, but most are based on improving renewable energy storage and output, from long range electric vehicle batteries being developed by California company Envia Systems, to genetically engineered crops containing enzymes that will make it easier convert them into biofuel, which are being created by Agrivida, a Massachusetts company. Projects include genetically engineered crops for biofuel and longer-range EV batteries   Aside from convincing private investors of its merits, ARPA-E has also accomplished something fairly remarkable for the Department of Energy these days, winning endorsements from Republicans and even getting some to speak at the conference, as Bloomberg reports. That Republican support stands in stark contrast to the way some GOP lawmakers have gone after other Department of Energy investment projects made during the Obama Administration that haven't panned out, namely solar panel manufacturer Solyndra, which wasn't part of the ARPA-E program, but a separate loan office.  Outside of ARPA-E, the Department of Energy has also invested in other uncertain propositions like Elon Musk's Tesla Motors electric vehicle company. Musk himself spoke at the ARPA-E summit on Tuesday, saying that Tesla was ahead of schedule on paying back its $465 million loan from the the Department of Energy. Unlike the The Department of Energy's loan efforts, ARPA-E doesn't necessarily expect a return on its investment, handing out grants for projects the government acknowledges may be risky. That explains some of the pitches for new projects at the conference this week, among them creating reflective leafs to reduce the amount of heat trapped on Earth, as The New York Times reported.

And like all things related to black holes, the results are predictably mind-bending: The surface of the black hole at the center of the galaxy NGC 1365 is traveling at nearly light speed, according to the results of a new study made using space telescopes from NASA and the European Space Agency. Determining the black hole's spin rate in terms of an exact numeric velocity, like how speed works on Earth, is challenging because spinning black holes distort spacetime around them. ""It's not like we can paint a little dot on the black hole and watch it spin around at some velocity,"" said Fiona Harrison, a Caltech astrophysicist in charge of NASA's Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR), in a press conference held Wednesday on the find.  equivalent to a billion stars shining over the course of a billion years That said, scientists do know how much energy is given off by this black hole's rotational energy, equivalent to a billion stars shining over the course of a billion years. Scientists also know to what extent the black hole's spin is distorting spacetime. ""If you were standing near the event horizon of this particular black hole, you would have to turn around once every four minutes just to stand still,"" Harrison said. The supermassive black hole examined in this study has a mass two million times our Sun and its galaxy is located 60 million light years from Earth. Most galaxies are thought to have supermassive black holes at their center. But until now, scientists have only been able to estimate how fast they are spinning because clouds of gas block some of the view. NASA's NuSTAR telescope, launched into space last summer, takes a broader view of high-energy x-rays being emitted by the matter that gets sucked into a black hole.

In order to save fuel, the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO) has programmed a convoy of four trucks to drive just four meters (about 13 feet) apart. That cuts down on air resistance, reducing drag (and thus improving fuel efficiency) similar to drafting with a race car. NEDO's been working on the idea for a while, demonstrating a three-car convey with each car travelling about 15 meters apart (about 50 feet) in 2010. Three years later, the organization's four-car caravan is far more efficient. Japanese broadcaster NHK reports that the plan could reduce the vehicles' fuel consumption by up to 15 percent.  The four-car caravan uses one human-driven lead truck and three computer-controlled vehicles following it. The idea of having robotic vehicles automatically and expertly trail a human leader is comparable to DARPA's robotic packmule system presently in development for the US military.

It was a seemingly anonymous threat, but just two days later, authorities managed to trace it back to sophomore Eldo Kim, who's now awaiting trial in federal court. Kim used two separate anonymity tools to cover his tracks — the routing service Tor, which covered his web traffic, and the temporary mail service Guerrilla Mail, which offered a one-time email — but neither one was enough to throw authorities off the trail. Tor led them to Eldo Kim, who promptly confessed Kim's mistake, it turns out, was connecting through Harvard's wireless network. The FBI quickly traced the emails back to Guerrilla Mail, which in turn indicated that the service had been accessed through Tor. It's unclear how the agents discovered Guerrilla Mail had been accessed through Tor, but it's likely Guerrilla volunteered the information when faced with a federal counterterrorism investigation. (UPDATE: Security researcher Runa Sandvik points out that the originating IP address would have been revealed in the email header, which would have indicated Tor usage.) Suspecting a Harvard student was behind the threats, agents checked to see if anyone had accessed Tor through the local wireless networks. That led them to Kim, who promptly confessed. It's a reminder of the limitations of Tor, which can only disguise traffic within its own servers.

The sophisticated hack reportedly took place over several weeks — starting on Black Friday and possibly extending all the way through December 15th — and is said to involve ""nearly all"" Target stores in the United States. Krebs says the breach ""involves the theft of data stored on the magnetic stripe of cards used at the stores."" Online orders are said to be unaffected. Still, it sounds like a worst case scenario for Target and its shoppers, with Krebs writing: The type of data stolen — also known as ""track data"" — allows crooks to create counterfeit cards by encoding the information onto any card with a magnetic stripe.

The panel's statement speaks out against the NSA's pattern of bulk collection, stating as a general rule that ""the government should not be permitted to collect and store all mass, undigested, non-public personal information about individuals to enable future queries."" More specifically, the panel recommends the agency no longer be allowed to maintain its database of phone records, which was revealed this summer to include data on nearly all American phones. ""In our view, the current storage by the government of bulk meta-data creates potential risk to public trust, personal privacy and civil liberty,"" one passage reads. Previous reports suggested the panel would recommend a higher burden of proof for bulk metadata collection, which was ruled to be likely unconstitutional by a federal court earlier this week. The panel recommends keeping the database with phone companies or a trusted third party, requiring requests when data is needed. In the past, the NSA has said that investigations could be delayed by the extra step of asking phone companies for records. The panel would also ban the NSA from stockpiling zero-day exploits The panel also suggested new restrictions on the use of National Security Letters and FISC warrants to compel data from third parties, applying the same evidence standard required for a subpoena. That would mean any requests would have to be ""reasonable in focus, scope, and breadth."" In the same spirit, the recommendations would bar the NSA from asking companies to build backdoors, addressing allegations that the agency had deliberately weakened cryptographical standards in the interest of easier data collection. In a nod to recent requests by Google, Facebook, and others, the recommendations would permit companies to report ""general information"" about the number of government requests they have received and the number of users affected. The review panel is designed only to offer a template for executive action, so none of the panel's recommendations have the force of law. Still, it seems likely President Obama will act on the suggestions in the months to come. In a statement after the release of the document, the White House said that in the coming weeks, ""the President will work with his national security team to study the Review Group’s report, and to determine which recommendations we should implement."" At the same time, Congress has offered a number of avenues for potential NSA reform, including a bill from Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT) and Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner that reportedly influenced the panel's findings. The panel also recommends structural changes within the NSA, like separating the agency's defensive ""information assurance"" wing from the more central signals intelligence mission. On the cyberwar front, the recommendations would discourage the NSA from stockpiling zero-day exploits, the unpublished software vulnerabilities often used to gain unauthorized access to targeted computers, but not ban them outright. ""In rare instances, US policy may briefly authorize using a Zero Day for high priority intelligence collection,"" the report reads. The report takes a stronger line on the controversial link between the NSA and US Cyber Command, stating clearly, ""the head of the military unit, US Cyber Command, and the Director of NSA should not be a single person."" That recommendation directly contradicts a recent statement by the White House that General Alexander's successor would hold both posts at once. Already, many privacy advocates are cautiously optimistic about the recommendations. The American Civil Liberties Union was whole-heartedly positive, with executive director Anthony Romero saying, ""We urge President Obama to accept his own Review Panel’s recommendations and end these programs."" Others have had a more measured response. In a prepared statement, Kurt Opsahl, senior staff attorney to the Electronic Frontier Foundation said the panel ""floats a number of interesting reform proposals, and we're especially happy to see them condemn the NSA's attacks on encryption and other security systems people rely upon."" Still, Opsahl says the limitations on phone records don't go far enough.

The complaint alleges that Sony failed to adequately secure its systems despite years of warning signs, making a ""business decision to accept the risk."" Once the hack was under way, the complaint says Sony didn't do enough to protect employe information after the fact, despite multiple warnings from attackers. The case focuses particularly on the leak of 47,000 social security numbers from current and former employees, which occurred more than a week after the initial attack. It's unclear when the affected employees received credit monitoring services to help mitigate the effects of the leak, although Sony should have had ample warning that such a leak was possible. In a strange twist, the complaint seems to rely heavily on other leaked documents. Leaked emails help establish that executives were aware of the vulnerabilities in the computer system, and chose not to improve it after previous attacks.

Android Lollipop was announced at the same time as the Z3 went on sale, but Sony's upgrade to that software is only now starting to roll out. At a time when competitors' flagship phones are either already running Lollipop or being upgraded with even faster devices that have it preloaded, the Z3's luster is rapidly starting to fade. Early leaks of the Z3's successor, the presumed Xperia Z4, point to an almost unchanged device. The look remains the same and the internals are predictably updated with the newer Snapdragon 810 processor from Qualcomm. Given the backlash that HTC elicited when it released the One M9 with just subtle design tweaks and the same processor upgrade, Sony is facing an uphill struggle in trying to catalyze excitement for its next big phone release — at a time when its incumbent flagship is losing its place on store shelves.

The new players have already appeared a bit prematurely at retailers in recent days, but today they're official. First up, the flagship Roku 3 is gaining voice search, which should put it on better footing against Amazon's Fire TV box. It's basically what you'd expect; hit the dedicated voice search button on Roku 3's new remote, and speak out the name of a movie, show, actor, or director you're looking for. Results come up instantly, and in a brief demo, the Roku proved very accurate at understanding a spoken name or film title. As usual, you can click through and Roku's software will tell you where you can watch a specified movie or show based on which video services you currently subscribe to. You can initiate a voice search from anywhere (and at any time), though if you do so mid-movie, you'll briefly be taken out of Netflix or whatever app you were watching to see your results. The ""new"" Roku 3 retains its $99 price point.   Another new software feature being introduced today, the Roku Feed, aims to give you a heads up whenever movies in theaters right now eventually make their way to on-demand services including Amazon Instant Video, Vudu, Netflix, and others. Add a film like Furious 7 or The Divergent Series: Insurgent to your feed, and Roku will automatically notify you the moment it's available to stream somewhere. Follow movies from the theater to your favorite streaming services This ""Movies Coming Soon"" feature is just the beginning of Roku Feed, so it should be interesting to see where else the company takes it. My request would be for the Roku to present users with its own list of movies and shows leaving Netflix and Amazon soon, but we're not there yet. For now, we've still got you covered there.   But the best announcement today is most definitely the new Roku 2. Roku's middle-of-the-line media streamer isn't really so ""middle"" anymore. It's been upgraded with the same hardware specs and speedy performance as the Roku 3. The two devices are basically identical now. By going with the Roku 2, you lose out on the 3's fancier voice-capable remote, but since you can also initiate voice search with the Roku smartphone app — also being updated today — that's unlikely to be a deal breaker for most people. At $69, this much faster Roku 2 is a pretty nice deal when lined up next to the Apple TV and Amazon's set-top box. It's in the same ""impulse buy"" territory Apple was shooting for with its recent price cut, and I'd probably pick this over Apple's aging box — even if you won't be able to watch HBO Now for a few months. The shortcut buttons that Roku chooses for its remotes change from time to time. On Roku 3, you'll now see Netflix, Amazon, Rdio, and Hulu. On the Roku 2, Sling TV takes Hulu's spot, which should give Dish's internet TV service some nice exposure. Both new players are available starting now. Looking beyond today, the obvious question is when we'll see an even more powerful Roku 4, but the company is keeping quiet on that subject for now.",0.6095515322143013,0.39044846778569875,0.1725223968473305,558,4.6308243727598564,326,5.4877300613496933,1,4,"Home, Tech",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

After a couple of delays, OxygenOS is now available for OnePlus One owners to download and flash onto their smartphones. OxygenOS was developed in-house by OnePlus, though at this point it is merely a modest refresh of Android 5.0 Lollipop. In a blog post, the company explains that it took a ""back to basics"" approach with the software, adding, ""We place things like performance and battery life over gimmicks and bloated features."" ""Back to basics."" What that means is that the software doesn't look much different than what you'll see on a Nexus device. There are a few added features, like gesture shortcuts you can input while the screen is off, an expanded quick settings menu, a file explorer, and a couple of advanced options (most all of which were present in Cyanogen). But simple is not necessarily a bad thing — it should certainly be stable, fast, and functional. The company says its goal with OxygenOS ""is to provide faster, more meaningful updates and a better-integrated range of services for every OnePlus user."" What it doesn't say is that the software also gives it a way to reduce its dependence on Cyanogen. The two companies have had strained relations since Cyanogen signed an exclusive deal with Indian phone maker Micromax just before OnePlus' planned launch in the subcontinent. It's expected that OxygenOS will eventually be the default on future devices like the OnePlus Two, but, for now, you'll have to install it yourself over Cyanogen if you want it. You can find instructions on OnePlus' website.

The next three videos are a bit shorter, and focus on customizing the watch face, using the messaging app, and the oddball ""digital touch"" features that let you send quick sketches, tap patterns, or your heartbeat to other Watch users.

The presence of two vastly different types of rock on the planet was a curious discovery, and led the MIT team to create an experiment that would hopefully point to a geographical process responsible for the disparity. Researchers recreated the rocks in a lab and exposed both to a variety of temperatures and pressures. “You can tell what would happen as the melt cools and crystals form and change the chemical composition of the remaining melted rock,” said Timothy Grove, a geology professor at MIT. “The leftover melt changes composition.” Ultimately Grove and his associates concluded that the two rock compositions couldn't have come from the same region, leaving the so-called ""lava ocean"" as the only viable explanation. If magma did at one point cover some of Mercury's surface, it was a long time ago. “The crust is probably more than 4 billion years old, so this magma ocean is a really ancient feature,"" Grove said.

The President's 2013 budget request also calls for $699 million for the new division this year, but to get that amount of money, it's up to Congress to pass that budget or an alternate one, and lawmakers don't appear close to doing that any time soon.

The team created the wing because bats are so light — and uncooperative — that attaching them to monitoring equipment negates their ability to fly. Using a complex system of joints, a flexible silicone elastomer membrane, servo motors, and a pulley system, the researchers were able to achieve the same weight-to-thrust ratio of a regular wing, and finely tune the frequency of the flapping motion to better understand what affect it has on flight. It's nowhere near as intricate as a regular bat wing, which has 25 movable joints and 34 degrees of freedom, but it's still able to mimic bats' wing-folding motion that helps the creatures gain altitude and change flight direction extremely quickly.  The focus of this US Air Force-backed research wasn't to develop a full robotic bat — the weight of the batteries and motors would make actual flight impossible — but the project is still in its early stages. The team will continue to run tests, and hope that future technological advances will allow further degrees of freedom to be added.

""The logic behind enhanced public access is plain,"" said John Holdren, director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy,"" in a statement announcing the new order. Currently, many federally funded research papers are accessible in their final form only through paid subscription journals and paywalled websites, such as the JSTOR database and Lexis Nexis. The new plan would make sure that these papers were available for free outside those journals within a year, potentially depriving the journals of revenue from readers who are willing to wait for the free versions. But journal lobbying groups applauded the White House plan as sensible and ""balanced."" “We support the [White House] OSTP’s compatible goals of broadening access while preserving the high-quality, peer-reviewed articles on which the science community and the public rely,"" said Tom Allen, President and CEO, of the American Association of Publishers, in a statement. The AAP represents JSTOR's parent company, Ithaka.   Decidedly more complex than it seems That's because the actual White House memo is decidedly more complex than Holdren's statement makes it out to be: It give the agencies six months, until August, to come up with plans to make the research they support public within a year after that. It ""provides the flexibility to make changes in the future,"" including giving agencies the ability to extend the period of time that research can stay embargoed, out of the public domain. Agencies may also cite national and ""economic"" security as reasons to keep research out of the public eye. Those exceptions have some activists, including University of California, Berkeley biologist Michael Eisen, claiming the White House sold out to the publishing companies that profit of publicly funded research. ""My concerns are that it's completely lame,"" Eisen told The Verge in an email, after taking to Twitter to lambaste the memo. ""The embargoed 12 months are the most important period of a papers life. And there is NO reason to allow this embargo except that the publishers don't want it,"" he added. ""My concerns are that it's completely lame."" In addition, the White House's open access memo repeatedly states that the federal agencies only have to open their research to the public ""to the extent feasible,"" which gives exceptions for ""U.S. national, homeland, and economic security.""",0.7017627898244481,0.29823721017555194,0.8767078859373344,505,5.1742574257425744,283,6.1837455830388697,0,0,"Policy & Law, Science, Web, Politics, Report",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

On Friday, Armstrong's lawyers stated that the US Department of Justice had joined a federal whistleblower lawsuit against Armstrong filed by former teammate Floyd Landis.  The DOJ can join any lawsuit filed under the False Claims Act, but the federal government's involvement is also noteworthy because the Armstrong's cycling team's primary sponsor was the United States Postal Service. The suit charges that Armstrong defrauded the USPS by concealing his doping and retaliating against team members who revealed both the doping and the fraud. According to the the Associated Press, Armstrong and the federal government had been in settlement talks, but a source close to the talks says the two sides are ""tens of millions of dollars apart on how much Armstrong should pay to settle the case."" Doping lawsuit could cost Armstrong tens of millions of dollars  Officially, Armstrong's legal stance is that the USPS has not been damaged by its $40 million sponsorship of the cycling team. ""The Postal Service's own studies show that the service benefited tremendously from its sponsorship — benefits totaling more than $100 million,"" said Armstrong's attorney Robert Luskin. One assumes that the revelation that Armstrong led the USPS team in years of cheating and concealing his cheating and is eventual public disgrace after years of full-throated denials is not factored into that $100 million figure. Landis first filed his whistleblower lawsuit against Armstrong in 2010. Landis won the 2006 Tour de France but was later stripped of his title for doping. (Armstrong was recently stripped of his Tour de France titles as well.) Landis and other teammates charged that Armstrong and USPS team manager Johan Bruyneel pressured other members of the teams to use the banned substance EPO and take other measures to prevent detection both of their own doping and that of their teammates. The suit seeks redress for Armstrong's violation of his sponsorship contract's morals clause, for fraud in concealing those violations, and for intimidating and punishing teammates and other employees who attempted to reveal those violations to the world. Armstrong was an innovator in concealing doping, and that's what will ultimately haunt himIn the history of sports doping, Armstrong and his team members were particularly innovative in the efforts they made to conceal their activities and enforce discipline. Their incentives weren't limited to winning races but were directly tied to lucrative sponsorship agreements. Armstrong may have finally paid the price for doping within the sport, which never would have happened without whistleblowers speaking out. But the real price in terms of both dollars and legal punishment will come from his sponsors. It will come from the federal government, and it will be for bullying and fraud.",0.7483788351681042,0.2516211648318958,0.8610678112183606,486,5.3765432098765435,265,6.1584905660377363,0,0,"Culture, Policy & Law, Science",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Stressing the importance of the US Cyber Command, General Keith Alexander put out a shocking idea: nations are using malware to try to bring down the US financial system, and if his agency doesn’t keep an eye on the web, they won't be able to stop it. ""It could literally take down the US economy."" NSA director of cyber defense Deborah Plunkett described the threat as a BIOS attack, kicking in as soon as a computer boots up and rendering every device it touches completely inoperable. It's the kind of thing antivirus companies like Symantec have been warning about since the '90s, often with the help of journalists — but Plunkett was saying she'd seen it in the wild. ""One of our analysts actually saw that the nation state had the intention to develop and to deliver, to actually use this capability to destroy computers.""   She painted the attack as a cascade of destruction, laying waste the nation's technological infrastructure. ""It could literally take down the US economy,"" Plunkett warned. So, could it? NSA skepticism aside, should we be bracing for the kind of worst-case-scenario worm that Plunkett describes? On some level, the idea isn't as implausible as it sounds. While most attacks focus on low-level fraud like identity theft, it’s still easy to imagine a state actor doing more damage. We've also seen a growing number of threats to stock exchanges, so it's not as if financial architecture is immune to malware. Plunkett's scenario is intentionally vague, meant to conjure up an abstract threat, but that doesn't mean weaponized malware isn't a real issue. China has already used the tactics to tap foreign ministries' devices, while legal malware-for-hire businesses make millions selling their wares to governments. ""The damage would be no more disruptive than a major east coast blizzard."" Still, it's just not clear the attack would inflict the apocalyptic levels of damage that the NSA would have you believe. Nicholas Weaver, a computer science researcher at ICSI, studied the so-called ""worst-case worm"" scenario for DARPA in 2004, and says the risk of ""self damage"" (that is, damaging their own networks with the worm) would be enough to dissuade any attackers. At the same time, an attack would need to infect a huge number of computers to be truly disruptive. Even if a quarter of all PCs were unrecoverable (a huge feat in itself), the result might be more of an inconvenience than a crisis. Even if the attack closed government offices and stock markets for a day, it's hard to say if it would have any long term effects. ""In retrospect, I believe our damage estimates were high,"" Weaver says. ""The resulting damage would be no more disruptive than a major east coast blizzard."" ""If [China] crashed the US economy, they'd crash their own economy."" At the same time, the political logic behind the attack is even more confounding. Tracing the attack back to its source would be fairly easy, leaving would-be attackers with a lot of risk and very little reward. Even stranger, to many observers, has been the proposition that China would even want to crash the US economy. ""They already have that ability in a way we can't really control, because they could crash the dollar really easily,"" says Marcy Wheeler, who has covered the NSA extensively at her blog Empty Wheel. ""But they haven't done that, because if they crashed the US economy, they'd crash their own economy."" US Cyber Command isn't in the anti-virus business In fact, we already know what state-sponsored malware looks like, and it's a good deal less splashy than 60 Minutes would have you believe. It's more espionage than warfare, whether it's stealing industrial secrets, peeking into journalists' emails, or targeting opposition-group activists. The goal isn't destruction, but surveillance. When the programs do turn violent (say, in an Iranian nuclear plant), it's more of a targeted strike than a carpet-bombing. If a country genuinely wanted to destroy the US economy, it would be better off using actual bombs. Computer warfare, for all its dangers, simply isn't that devastating. But there's an even bigger question that Alexander hasn't come close to answering: in the event of such an attack, what would the NSA actually do? The US Cyber Command isn't in the anti-virus business, and there's no evidence that it has any capability or interest in defending the larger web. The US is the world's largest buyer of malware, and aside from government-owned infrastructure, it's a purely offensive program. It's not like conventional warfare, where soldiers fight other soldiers and planes shoot down other planes. Our malware and their malware can share the web quite easily, and private firms will be left to deal with the collateral damage. The claim is that these programs make Americans safer on the web, that we're better off as long as the US is winning the cyberwar — but it's not true. The only result is more victims, from Uyghur dissidents all the way up to The New York Times. And when they discover they've been targeted, the NSA will be nowhere in sight.",0.2951046393268641,0.7048953606731359,0.17967809077159302,889,4.9741282339707533,482,6.1390041493775938,0,0,"US & World, National Security, Report",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

Naturally, Feinstein argues that it'll be found legal, but she'd still like that belief to be held up. ""I believe it is crucial to settling the issue once and for all,"" Feinstein says.  ""Clearly we have competing decisions."" Feinstein's statement comes following a federal court ruling yesterday that the program is in fact unconstitutional.

""Clearly we have competing decisions from those of at least three different courts."" Much of the contention lies in courts' continued application of Smith v. Maryland, a 1979 Supreme Court decision that's been used to justify the legality of metadata collection. In his ruling yesterday, Judge Richard Leon argued that the decision is now too outdated to be held to. ""When do present-day circumstances ... become so thoroughly unlike those considered by the Supreme Court 34 years ago that a precedent like Smith simply does not apply?"" Leon's decision reads.

""That is not going to happen,"" one executive reportedly responded. ""We are there to talk about the NSA."" ""We are there to talk about the NSA."" This declaration is in line with previous attempts to force the Obama administration's hand on intelligence community reform: Yahoo, Google, Apple, Microsoft, Facebook, and more have filed lawsuits or supporting briefs against NSA surveillance, and last week, a tech company coalition released an open letter to the White House calling for change. Still, Obama tried to start the meeting on a light note with some topical humor, asking Hastings about the upcoming second season of the hit Netflix political thriller series House of Cards: ""I’m just wondering if Reed brought advance copies of House of Cards?"" Obama said. Hastings jokingly responded ""we'll fix you up a cameo."" Obama continued, expressing admiration for the series' malevolent antihero Frank Underwood, played by Kevin Spacey: ""I wish things were that ruthlessly efficient. It's true, I was looking at Kevin Spacey and I was thinking: 'this guy's getting a lot of stuff done.'""  What hasn't been made public yet is exactly how President Obama responded to surveillance concerns during the meeting, or what was specifically discussed. Absent details, the meeting is primarily good company PR and a push for the administration to speed reform. In a release after the fact, the White House said that it ""made clear that we will consider their input as well as the input of other outside stakeholders as we finalize our review of signals intelligence programs."" ""I wish things were that ruthlessly efficient."" A statement from the companies involved, meanwhile, said that ""we appreciated the opportunity to share directly with the president our principles on government surveillance that we released last week and we urge him to move aggressively on reform."" But the administration so far hasn't gone much further than promising increased transparency and reform, though it's moved forward on declassifying documents that provide a window into the NSA's operations. The biggest news to come out of the meeting, meanwhile, was that former Microsoft executive Kurt DelBene is stepping up as the new manager of Healthcare.gov. By the end of the year, the Obama administration and an external review panel will have concluded investigations into how the NSA and other intelligence agencies can be reformed without sacrificing national security interests. While the panel's report has not been declassified, it reportedly recommends dismantling the NSA's phone record database and requiring it to request more specific metadata from third parties, a measure that has also been proposed in Congress. And the metadata program now faces a legal challenge after a federal judge declared it was likely unconstitutional and ordered the NSA to remove metadata from two plaintiffs (though this decision was put on hold pending an appeal.) For AT&T, one of the companies represented at the meeting, this could create real change in how it provides information about users to the government. For Netflix, Twitter, Microsoft, Facebook, or any other companies at the meeting, however, this decision will be immaterial in the short term, as it specifically addresses phone records rather than email or other online communications. Instead, these companies have asked for a clear legal framework to bind intelligence agencies, the option to reveal how many requests for information the government has sent, and ""sensible limitations"" on collecting user information, including an end to databases that aggregate material from people not apparently connected to any crime.

The letter was published in Portuguese Tuesday in Folha de S. Paulo, a Brazilian newspaper. David Miranda, the partner of outspoken Rio-based journalist Glenn Greenwald, later published an English-language version of the letter to his Facebook page. In the letter, Snowden praised Brazilian leaders for speaking out against American spying after it was revealed that the NSA had conducted widespread surveillance of companies and civilians in Brazil, including President Dilma Rousseff. The revelations have raised diplomatic tensions in Brazil, prompting Rousseff to call for the country to build a new fiber-optic system to evade NSA monitoring. Snowden, who is currently living as a fugitive in Russia, leaked classified documents on the NSA's spy programs earlier this year to Greenwald, who reported on them in June for the Guardian. In the letter published Tuesday, he said that Brazilian lawmakers have asked him for assistance in investigating the NSA's operations in Brazil and that he is willing to do so, though his efforts have been hampered without political asylum. ""I have expressed my willingness to assist wherever appropriate and lawful."" ""I have expressed my willingness to assist wherever appropriate and lawful, but unfortunately the United States government has worked very hard to limit my ability to do so,"" the letter reads. ""Until a country grants permanent political asylum, the US government will continue to interfere with my ability to speak."" In October, Greenwald urged Brazilian senators to grant asylum to Snowden, claiming that the leaker could help the government better understand the NSA's programs. Snowden had previously requested asylum from Brazil and other countries, before being granted temporary asylum by Russia in August. A senior NSA official this week suggested that the US may be considering offering amnesty to Snowden, saying the idea is ""worth having a conversation about"" in an interview with 60 Minutes, though White House Press Secretary Jay Carney sought to curtail that speculation on Monday, telling reporters that the contractor should return to the US and face criminal charges.

Just the latest malady In a scathing piece that's the result of a six-month-long investigation, The Center says the FEC is falling apart — something that should be a concern given its role of keeping tabs on and policing political campaign finance laws. The independent regulatory agency was formed in 1975, but has spent the past five years with flat funding, understaffing, and a massive backlog of compliance reports. All this is cause for concern, The Center says, given that a midterm election and 2016 presidential election are just around the corner. Adding insult to injury, The Center notes that the FEC was warned of weak security as part of an independent security audit, something the agency brushed off. The FDA wasn't as lucky, suffering its own breach during the shutdown. That attack resulted in a compromise of names, phone numbers, passwords, and other sensitive information on some 14,000 accounts, something that is currently being probed by US Energy and Commerce committee. However there is one bright spot for the FEC, The Center says: a pair of new commissioners who were sworn in just before the hack could shake things up before they get worse.

In a letter sent to multiple publications — including The New York Times, Gawker, Recode, and The Verge — attorney David Boies asks that companies stop downloading and delete any information they may have, otherwise ""SPE will have no choice but to hold you responsible for any damage or loss"" that could result. (You can read Boies' letter to The Verge right here.) The emails and data leaked since the hack have spurred on a media frenzy. Gawker did a deep dive on email exchanges between producer Scott Rudin and Sony Pictures head Amy Pascal about the embattled Steve Jobs biopic, while other outlets have covered everything from the salaries of Sony executives to the aliases movie stars use. Last week The Verge uncovered evidence of Project Goliath, an aggressive initiative between the MPAA and the major Hollywood studios designed to thwart piracy that could potentially alter the open nature of the internet itself. Aaron Sorkin called journalists ""morally treasonous"" But the studio itself has mainly kept quiet thus far, save for Pascal (and Rudin) apologizing for racially offensive jokes made about President Obama’s taste in movies. That changed yesterday with the letters from Boies, a legal world heavyweight who represented Al Gore in Bush v. Gore and Oracle in its failed infringement suit against Google. The conversation moved further along yesterday with a New York Times op-ed from writer Aaron Sorkin, whose own emails had been leaked as part of the Jobs biopic discussion. In yesterday’s opinion piece, Sorkin called journalists reporting on the leaked information ""morally treasonous and spectacularly dishonorable,"" and claimed that none of the emails contained information that warranted public discussion. (Our own Emily Yoshida outlined our thoughts on the ethical implications of reporting on the leaks — as well as the importance of bringing Project Goliath to light — last week.) Despite Boies’ efforts, however, it seems unlikely that a letter will stop press momentum on the story. Recently Gawker published an email from Channing Tatum celebrating the success of 22 Jump Street, and just this morning The Daily Beast revealed talks between Tatum and Guardians of the Galaxy star Chris Pratt about a new Ghostbusters film.

It pops up multiple times throughout her new record The Pinkprint — sometimes paired with a gasping, slightly unhinged cackle — seemingly for no reason, like a punctuation mark in an obscure foreign language. At varying points it sounds like an audible eye roll, or a kiss-off to peanut gallery criticism in its many frivolous forms — or perhaps it's simply an offhand page break signaling a song's transition into its next phase. There could be a much simpler explanation, though: the sound likely has its roots in professional vocal training. Singing warm-ups sound ridiculous by nature, and the siren tongue-trill Minaj tosses off mid-song on tracks like ""Feeling Myself"" or ""Anaconda"" is no exception; in a practice setting, that descending head-voice glissando is extended into an extremely obnoxious siren-like noise, accompanied by a tongue or lip trill that serves to loosen one's face and mouth muscles while also stretching one's vocal cords. It also happens to feel pretty awesome. Considering her arts high school background, it isn't too farfetched to assume Minaj's sound is not a coincidence.  And yes, I'm going to suggest that this is a metaphor: much of The Pinkprint, like Nicki's mini-trills, feels like a diligent personal exercise — its subject matter and overall effect are transitional, not definitive (as she's claimed herself in pre-release interviews). Compared with the highly stylized performances of her first and second records, her third feels downright athletic, like a stretching routine. While it may not be quite iconic, it's still an effective reminder of just how invaluable Minaj is, not just as a rapper and artist but also as an unapologetic, brilliantly nuanced public figure. The Pinkprint is at times an agonizingly candid record Apart from the requisite overselling proclamations, the way Nicki has described The Pinkprint in the press — as ""a dope balance of vulnerability and strength, of inspiration, and of not being politically correct"" — is remarkably accurate. It falls almost exactly at the halfway point between ""Pop Nicki"" and ""Mixtape Nicki,"" the nicknames used to describe an invisible turning point at which the rapper began employing pop melodies on kid-friendly (in radio edit form, at least) tracks like ""Starships."" Of course, the she never actually stopped rapping as aggressively as her male peers, and ""Pop Nicki"" and ""Mixtape Nicki"" don't actually exist; they're just tags that allow critics and fans to categorize Minaj within the musical firmament, and they are promptly grated into dust and shaken up on The Pinkprint, her least confrontational, most human record. More than any of her previous work, these songs explore the deeper recesses of Minaj's own psyche, lacing her signature braggadocio and powerhouse defiance with uncertain regret, paranoia, and straight-up despair (On ""Buy a Heart,"" ""It's a heart for sale, who's buying?"" and on ""Grand Piano,"" ""Am I just a fool? / Blind and stupid for loving you / Am I just a silly girl?""). This honesty isn't exactly surprising; she's certainly one of the most self-aware, straight-talking musicians currently working, proving time and time again that misrepresentations of her character, gender, and talents will not be tolerated.  But for the first time, on this record she suspends her hyper-performative image — that candy-coated, ludicrously successful modus operandi that has produced everything from Barbie costumes to an unstable, British male alter ego (while simultaneously garnering bitterly sexist criticism from the über-masculine hip-hop world) — in favor of a project built almost entirely with her own ends in mind. The result is a record that is personal in every sense of the word: self-indulgent, soul-searching, sybaritic — an ode to herself, Nicki the Person, instead of an easily summed-up caricature. It takes a long time to become bulletproof in the celebrity world, where ""authenticity"" is just as much a performance as a cotton-candy-colored wig The Pinkprint is almost 100% a no-flex zone in which little time is wasted trying to convince an audience of her supremacy (""Why the fuck I gotta say it? You n***as don't know it yet?"" she raps on ""Want Some More"") and anthems like the Beyoncé-featuring ""Feeling Myself"" and Ariana Grande-assisted ""Get on Your Knees"" land with hell-yeah blunt force. The record's scandalous lead single, a giddy track on which she audibly cracks herself up — is also among its most self-assured, equally laden with Mix-a-lot samples as with emoji-worthy boning euphemisms. But this is no Beyoncé; the record's edges are jagged, risky, and sometimes contradictory (see: ""Only""). Still, the transparent humanity and effort apparent even on duds like ""Four Door Aventador"" are what make Minaj exceptional: the unstoppable, sometimes raw diligence of an imperfect, oft-nitpicked yet undeniably extraordinary talent. The album is a self-medicating inner monologue, performed in full view of a capricious public, and as paradoxical and complex as befits the best, busiest, and most successful female rapper alive.  ""I'm at the level in my career and in my life now where I can do whatever the hell I want to,"" Minaj told Complex earlier this fall. It's a little absurd to think that that level didn't arrive years ago — upon the release of Kanye West's Minaj-ethered ""Monster,"" for example. But it takes far longer than one might think to make one's public persona bulletproof — not just in hip-hop or even mainstream pop but also in the wider world of fame, where ""authenticity"" is just as much a performance as a cotton-candy-colored wig. The Pinkprint is at times an agonizingly candid record in which its author dominates while also faltering and doubting herself, exploits others and allows herself to be exploited, simultaneously rejects and embraces sentimentality, both owns and relinquishes her own sexual agency, and seems to have ordered her tracklist by lottery — without the context of the critical and commercial slam-dunks before it, it might have fallen flat.    But in turn, without The Pinkprint — that siren-like, nonchalant, throat-clearing purr — her next act might not be as well-conditioned for classic territory. Ironically, the dominant voice on The Pinkprint is a more convincing and necessary voice in Nicki's head than anything the schizophrenic Roman could ever say. But you know what they say about art: it's a lie that makes us see the truth, eventually.",0.6648279431701349,0.33517205682986506,0.1834679563934883,1087,5.2318307267709292,607,6.7149917627677098,0,0,"Culture, Entertainment, Music Review",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

For a man whose career essentially missed the modern internet, new music from D'Angelo did not fail to set social media on fire. I feel conflicted about critiquing this record, mostly because I'm just overjoyed that D'Angelo feels comfortable and confident to make and release new music. I'm rooting for him, in other words, in a way that I don't for most musicians. Voodoo was such a powerful antidote to the stuff that passed for R&B at my high school, hits from teeny boppers like Britney Spears, N'Sync, and 98 Degrees. Black Messiah doesn't measure up If I'm being brutally honest, however, Black Messiah doesn't measure up. The greatest joy of Voodoo was D'Angelo's vocal range, alternating from silky smooth to ragged gospel to lascivious funk. He plays with that diversity on this new album, but to me his vocals sound far less distinctive and are often buried beneath a layer of distortion that smothers the transcendent sensation I get listening to tracks like Voodoo's ""Untitled (How Does It Feel).""     On ""How Does It Feel,"" D'Angelo's voice is double- and triple-layered, crafting elegant harmonies with himself. The instrumental backing is minimal, building to a series of crescendos around his aching vocals. It was a rare instance of an artist baring himself completely — both musically and, in the unforgettable video, physically. It made him into a sex symbol and, more than decade later, hasn't lost any of its power. The video is four and half minutes, but for the real experience, listen to the full album version and wait for that moment six minutes in (Six. Minutes.) when he completely lets loose. The new D'Angelo sounds like what it is: the tortured follow-up to an album that cannot be topped All of which is to say, Black Messiah is music that I like. It's full of live instrumentation, interesting arrangements, and strikingly human vocals that stand out against the majority of singers on the charts and in the clubs these days. There are weird digressions and also tight grooves, but ultimately the new D'Angelo sounds like what it is: the tortured follow-up to an album that cannot be topped, plagued by 14 years of self-doubt from the singular genius at the center of it. On ""Back to the Future (Part I),"" D'Angelo sings ""So if you're wondering about the shape I'm in / I hope it ain't my abdomen you're referring to."" That's a sly joke about his personal struggles with substance abuse and weight gain, a nice moment where he shows a sense of humor about the demons that have kept him silent for so long. I think that's why I feel like such a heel for reviewing this album. Every album cannot be a new Voodoo; hell, it's possible he'll never reach those highs again. I'm just happy D'Angelo is back, and apparently the rest of the internet is, too. I hope this record, whatever its flaws, means we can expect more new music from him, preferably sooner than 2028.",0.6036400509111062,0.3963599490888938,0.18120338788366605,660,4.7030303030303031,392,5.6734693877551017,0,0,"Culture, Entertainment, Music Review",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

According to Vox, the reason Buffy reruns suck right now is because 20th Century Fox decided to remaster the famed '90s TV series into a widescreen format. And in doing so, it introduced a number of errors that creator Joss Whedon never would have allowed the first time around.  Buffy was shot 4x3 cuz TVs were shaped that way. Widescreen Buffy is nonsense. (Firefly was shot wide - Fox cropped it.) #apsectratiowoes   I prefer my '90s fuzzy if it also means that they're error free In this shot, for example, you can clearly see a love-sick Angel sleeping on Buffy's floor with sunlight streaming down his face. Now, from a storyline standpoint, this doesn't make any sense. Buffy and Angel only hang out at night – because he's a vampire. That means that he tends to get smoky whenever he steps into sunlight. And if vampires stay there long enough, they burst into flames. Buffy's blinds might be enough to protect him from the sun for a short while, but certainly not for an extended period of time. In the simplest of terms, the dude should be covered in smoke by now. Of course, the original Buffy series never contained this error. When Fox remastered Buffy for high definition TVs, the filter that made the scene look like it was shot at night was removed.   And here, you can clearly spot a film crew member in the Scoobies' main hangout, the library. Tell me, Fox, what purpose does that serve? Sure, the image is clearer in high-definition. But quite frankly, I prefer my '90s fuzzy if it also means that I can watch them error free. And most of all, I like to see all the action — not just the tiny bit that Fox decides to zoom into to accommodate a world full of wide screens.   Fox isn't the only media company that's been having problems with the SD to HD transition. HBO has also been working on a widescreen version of its hit The Wire, and has had to make decisions about what to cut out of the frame. But at least HBO got the show's creator to act as a consultant during the transition. Fox didn't, as evidenced by creator Joss Whedon's only tweet on the matter.   Given how little regard Fox is showing for Buffy, I can't imagine myself watching the HD format. Luckily, a number of video streaming platforms, including Netflix, still carry the original. And if that's not enough, faithful Scoobies can always check out the latest Buffy storylines in the Whedon-approved Buffy comics.

Malick has one of the most recognizable styles in filmmaking, known for his movies' gorgeous, dreamy, and drifting gaze at their subjects. His latest, Knight of Cups, appears to be no exception. The film teams Malick with Bale, Cate Blanchett, and Natalie Portman, and a bewildering and entrancing first trailer for it was just released. It also came along with this bizarre description of the film:  Once there was a young prince whose father, the king of the East, sent him down into Egypt to find a pearl. But when the prince arrived, the people poured him a cup. Drinking it, he forgot he was the son of a king, forgot about the pearl and fell into a deep sleep. Rick’s (Christian Bale) father used to read this story to him as a boy. The road to the East stretches out before him. Will he set forth? It's totally unclear what that means, but the movie appears to be exploring fame and excess through Bale's character's relationship with different women. The film is set to premiere at the Berlin Film Festival in February, and you'll likely be able to see it in theaters later next year. If you're put off by this trailer's almost total lack of clarity, just know that this is a style that Malick is usually able to pull off, putting together a mixture of moody and insightful moments to form a greater whole. That style has come through strong in his most recent two films, 2011's The Tree of Life being particularly successful at it. Knight of Cups actually looks like it may be a more focused film from Malick, with its trailer suggesting a tense tone and some interesting digital camerawork. Regardless of the outcome, Malick fans will be happy for just about anything: he's disappeared from filmmaking for decades at a time, so any new release is worth watching.

There’s no getting around the fact that Kickstarter projects are a gamble. You can spend $100 on something like the Pebble just as easily as you can on something that was supposed to be a watch, but comes delivered late and resembles a potato.  That gamble, and the chance to come out on the other end with something nice, is what makes the Sesame smart lock so intriguing. For $149, or $89 for its early backers, it’s promising the same features as similar products that cost nearly twice as much. It’s even been graced with a promotional video made by Adam Lisagor, aka Sandwich, who has quickly become the Billy Mays of startup video pitches.  Like competitors August and first-generation Lockitron, the Sesame lock is designed to fit on top of deadbolts to remotely lock and unlock your door using Bluetooth and a small motor. It’s a dead simple idea, but also one that’s proven to be finicky for companies that have already beaten Sesame to market. For instance, early buyers of the August smart lock, which is adorned with the loving design touches of Yves Behar, ran into problems with the lock automatically engaging and disengaging (even when people were not home), or taking a very long time to connect over Bluetooth. I wasn’t able to test whether these same things happen with a pre-production version of Sesame. But I was able to see the Sesame successfully lock and unlock the front door of our office through its app, as well its special feature can trigger the lock with a custom knock pattern on your phone from inside your pocket, or right on your door. The knock feature makes it a standout among other smart locks in its class. It’s also made the Sesame a security concern for people that worry about others overhearing or watching your pattern, then invading your house. Sesame creator Che-ming Ku, who was demoing for me, contends that the feature can only be activated when the lock detects your phone (or others you’ve programmed it to recognize) in proximity over Bluetooth, and that people can turn it off completely if they don’t want to use it. Users can also adjust the Bluetooth proximity so that you need to be right by the door, something that could keep people from unlocking your door with the feature when you’re inside your home. Another thing I was able to see was the initial setup of it on three different locks, including two that were installed on the doors in our office. It turns out the version I saw, which Ku says is not a final production candidate, flat out did not work on the two deadbolts in our office (which were different designs). The latches were too low for the Sesame's internal mechanism, which cups over it to simulate what your fingers would normally do from inside your house, to get a good grip. The production model, which has already been designed, but is not yet available for demo, adds a layer of foam around the cup to form a better seal around the latch, and promises to work with a wider array of locks and lock positions. Ku broke out the sticky foam tape, added a few strips to approximate what the final version will include, and the problematic lock worked right away. One feature that did not seem to work so well, but that Ku says will be sorted out in the final version, is the lock’s awareness of how far the lock is turned. When you set up the lock for the first time, you’re basically training it to understand how much rotation occurs to go from locked to unlocked. The Sesame uses accelerometers to do what our eyeballs and hands can put together in our brains. But because of some of the wiggle room without the proper seal, it could be miscalibrated just enough to keep a little bit of the bolt out, keeping the door shut. This happened several times, and caused Ku to need to recalibrate, which is not the kind of thing you want to happen when you’re trying to get into your home and you don’t have a key. One other thing to consider with this lock and others like it is that you might have to give up one touch of security in exchange for convenience. If your dwelling has both a deadbolt and lockable door handle, you’ll have to keep that door handle unlocked. Ku says that with the app installed, you can get notifications if the door is opened up, and when people lock and unlock the deadbolt manually, which is something you wouldn't get otherwise. But it’s still something to think about. Some things I didn't see working but that are coming: integration with the Apple Watch and Android Wear. You'll be able to say ""OK Google, open sesame"" into your wrist and have your front door unlock. Another feature integrates with Apple's HomeKit, so you can issue the same command to Siri from your phone. And last but not least is a small Wi-Fi Bluetooth adapter that can be added onto the system to let you lock and unlock the Sesame over your Wi-Fi network when you're not in range. This has become pretty standard among similar smart lock devices, though Ku noted that by not putting the Wi-Fi chip into the lock, Sesame is capable of squeezing about 500 days of runtime on a single pair of batteries. Is it possible to make a recommendation from all this one way or another? Without seeing the final model, it’s too soon to tell, though I saw enough to verify that this is no potato. And for $149, Sesame is not asking for much compared to the price of others like it, though you’d be wise to wait to see how well the final model works before pulling the trigger. Also, its reign as least expensive lock through the Kickstarter campaign might not last long. Lockitron's second model is on its way very soon for $99 and does many of the same things. One thing is clear though, Ku seems dedicated. When I ask him whether he plans to finish school given that he and his colleagues have already raised close to a million dollars from this side project of his, he says yes without hesitation. After all, he’s got more work to do.",0.4862711516562469,0.5137288483437531,0.17111988441123493,1085,4.5493087557603689,505,5.7623762376237622,0,3,"Home, Tech, Hands-on",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

You probably know the story from there: Gates went on to become the wealthiest man in the world, and then gradually pulled back from his company to focus on broad philanthropic efforts through the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. (In case you missed it, Gates guest-edited The Verge this February to discuss many of those charitable programs.) But Gates is far from finished at Microsoft; last year after Satya Nadella took over as CEO, Gates said he would be taking a bigger role at the company — using up to a third of his time to advise Microsoft employees on new products. Gates sent the following letter to Microsoft employees today to celebrate the company's 40th anniversary. The letter was posted on Twitter by Amit Choudhary, and sources confirmed its authenticity to The Verge. Tomorrow is a special day: Microsoft's 40th anniversary. Early on, Paul Allen and I set the goal of a computer on every desk and in every home. It was a bold idea and a lot of people thought we were out of our minds to imagine it was possible. It is amazing to think about how far computing has come since then, and we can all be proud of the role Microsoft played in that revolution. Today though, I am thinking much more about Microsoft's future than its past. I believe computing will evolve faster in the next 10 years than it ever has before. We already live in a multi-platform world, and computing will become even more pervasive. We are nearing the point where computers and robots will be able to see, move, and interact naturally, unlocking many new applications and empowering people even more. Under Satya's leadership, Microsoft is better positioned than ever to lead these advances. We have the resources to drive and solve tough problems. We are engaged in every facet of modern computing and have the deepest commitment to research in the industry. In my role as technical advisor to Satya, I get to join product reviews and am impressed by the vision and talent I see. The result is evident in products like Cortana, Skype Translator, and HoloLens -- and those are just a few of the many innovations that are on the way. In the coming years, Microsoft has the opportunity to reach even more people and organizations around the world. Technology is still out of reach for many people, because it is complex or expensive, or they simply do not have access. So I hope you will think about what you can do to make the power of technology accessible to everyone, to connect people to each other, and make personal computing available everywhere even as the very notion of what a PC delivers makes its way into all devices. We have accomplished a lot together during our first 40 years and empowered countless businesses and people to realize their full potential. But what matters most now is what we do next. Thank you for helping make Microsoft a fantastic company now and for decades to come.

SquareTrade is stoking the flames of Bendgate once again, and this time Samsung's Galaxy S6 Edge is the subject. The company that specializes in gadget warranties put the Edge through a torture test using its new ""Bendbot"" machine to see when it would bend and ultimately cease functioning entirely under pressure. The S6 Edge began to bend once the Bendbot made it up to 110 pounds. That's the same amount of force that led to bending in Apple's iPhone 6 Plus — and we know how much controversy Cupertino dealt with over the matter. (Yes, it can bend inside your pocket.) Read next: Galaxy S6 Edge review. It didn't matter then, and it doesn't matter now Likely owing to its unique curved screen, the S6 Edge's cover glass quickly cracked under that pressure, and the phone came undone completely beneath 149 pounds. The ""catastrophic failure"" point for iPhone 6 Plus was found to be a bit higher at 179 pounds. So yes, yet again we've learned that metal will bend under some significant weight. At the S6's unveiling, Samsung executives joked that the phone wouldn't suffer from the same build ""weaknesses"" as Apple's phablet, and here we are. Honestly, we wish SquareTrade had tested the regular S6 hardware; with more metal on the sides and a less fragile screen design, the end result probably would've looked different (for better or worse). Knowing the internet, someone will answer that call in a matter of days. But does it really matter? Should you fear the bend next week as you pull out your wallet to buy one of Samsung's best smartphones ever? No, most certainly not. Take care of your stuff, or buy a case if you're that concerned. Still, Samsung might want to cut back on the bluster and smack talk a bit. Yes, their phone bends too. For those curious, SquareTrade also tested HTC's new One M9, finding that it bent at 120 pounds. Unfortunately, the bend point also led to immediate death; the phone's power button didn't survive the deformation, making the whole device unusable.

It was Apple's first major product launch since the iPhone three years earlier, but it didn't feel like — or necessarily turn out to be — as dramatic of a shift in computing. Still, the iPad found success in much the same way as the iPhone, riding on nice hardware and an ecosystem of impressive apps. The shape of the iPad has changed quite a bit since then, but the tablet is still very much the same at its core. Below, we're looking over the major points in the iPad's release history, from its introduction five years ago through its latest sales stats in 2015. Steve Jobs went on stage at the Yerba Buena Center in San Francisco to unveil the original iPad a few months ahead of its launch. The refrain after the event was that Apple had just made a larger iPod touch — and, while that may have been true, it turned out to be a pretty good idea. Five years ago today, Apple put the first iPad up for sale. It would go on to sell 300,000 units on the first day and 2 million units in under 60 days. (Image credit: Tatsuo Yamashita / Flickr) The iPad 2's key change was a much nicer design — one that would stick with the iPad for its next two generations. This model also introduced the magnetic Smart Cover and front and rear cameras, which would go on to help make tablet photography a thing. Apple didn't release first weekend sales figures, but a Bloomberg report at the time cited analysts who pegged it at around 500,000 units. For some reason, Apple chose not to give this iPad a number, just referring to it as the ""new iPad."" Things quickly got confusing as Apple continued to sell the iPad 2 and then brought numbers back later on. The main update here: a high-res ""Retina"" display — a change people had long been waiting for. Apple sells 3 million in the first weekend. Less than a year after the 3rd generation iPad was released, Apple updated it with a faster processor and a lightning port. It also introduced a new entry to the family: the 7.9-inch iPad mini. Only the Wi-Fi models were made available immediately — LTE would come later — but Apple still managed to sell 3 million total units their first weekend. The iPad Air was the biggest design change in the history of the full-sized iPad. It was dramatically thinner and lighter than its predecessor, making it a pretty substantial update. The iPad mini saw a nice change, too, getting a high-res display and jumping ahead to what was then the current generation of Apple's processors. For some reason, Apple split up the iPad's release dates this year. That's probably part of the reason why it didn't release sales figures, as Apple doesn't usually like to say how well different models within a product line are doing. Apple raised the price on the iPad mini in 2013, from $329 for the original to $399 for the Retina display model — a jump seemingly justified by its new display and modern processor. This is, arguably, still the best iPad mini to buy. Apple finally returns to reasonable numbering schemes with the Air 2 and mini 3. Both tablets received Touch ID and a gold color option, but only the Air 2 got a new processor (the ultimate result of this was that Apple effectively managed to raise the price on the iPad mini from $329 to $399 without anyone noticing). Apple didn't give a specific on-sale date for its most recent iPads. Instead, it just said that they'd start shipping the next week. Once again, no first-week sales figures were released — perhaps because of declining overall iPad sales. During its earnings call in January, Apple announced that 250 million iPads had been sold to date worldwide. It's a nice milestone to hit just ahead of the iPad's fifth anniversary, but it hardly tells the tablet's full story. The iPad — and the tablet in general — was supposed to reinvent computing, and that hasn't really happened; certainly not in the way that the iPhone has. Instead, tablets today are largely in the place that they were five years ago: capable, fun, casual. But not critical or pragmatic. That is, seemingly, reflected in Apple's declining iPad sales. Even so, Apple continues to say that it believes the iPad will succeed in the long run, and maybe it's right: the iPad is a powerful platform, and no one else can catch up.",0.6441430341419356,0.35585696585806437,0.20719845429550096,774,4.576227390180879,398,5.5929648241206031,5,3,"Apple, Tech",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Kepler-37b, as it's known, is roughly 210 light-years from Earth, orbiting its star every 13 days at less than one-third of the distance between the Sun and Mercury. Besides being an interesting find, it's a sign that NASA's detection techniques have advanced since the first exoplanets were discovered. Early research outside our solar system turned up gas giants closer to Jupiter's size than Earth's, with the first ""unquestionably rocky"" exoplanet — though not the first to be potentially rocky — discovered by the Kepler team in early 2011. Since then, researchers have found a trove of smaller planets, and as detection improves, it's likely they'll discover more — while we might have previously suspected exoplanets of all sorts were common, we're now getting harder proof. Kepler-37b itself is near two other small planets, one three-quarters the size of Earth and another twice as big as our world. All three orbit close to their sun, which means their surfaces are probably formidably hot, and 37b isn't believed to have an atmosphere; they're distinctly not in the ""habitable zone"" that's the grail of Earth-like planet searches.

While the Argus II relies on glasses, an externally-mounted video camera, and a separate processing box, the Alpha IMS system detects light coming into the eye via electrodes implanted underneath the patient's retina, before feeding it into a microchip that sends the signals to the brain. The brain then processes the data as it would organic signals from a healthy eye, and the patient sees a black and white image. There's also a dial fitted behind the ear for adjusting brightness, and the whole system is powered wirelessly by a pocket battery.  Developed by researchers at the University of Tübingen, Germany, the Alpha IMS has a few benefits over the Argus II. It has 1,500 electrodes compared to the Argus II's 60, offering much higher resolution and clarity. Because it's implanted behind the retina, patients can look around naturally by moving their eyes — the Argus II requires its wearer to turn their head. It's also able to take advantage of the ""natural processing power"" of the neurons in the retina, which help to process motion and contrast. The Alpha IMS can't help everyone, unfortunately. Only patients that lose vision through diseases that destroy the eye's light-detecting cells are able to benefit from the prosthesis — if the vision-processing parts of the nervous system are damaged then the device has nothing to send its data to. Patients were able to recognize fine details like facial expressions Nine patients have already been fitted with Alpha IMS prostheses, of which eight implants were successful. The final patient's optic nerve head was touched during surgery, resulting in implant failure. First-hand accounts from the patients successfully fitted with the implant have extremely encouraging. Close-up, previously-blind patients were able to detect mouth shapes such as smiles; the absence or presence of glasses on the face of a passer-by; objects such as telephones and cutlery; and even finer details such as signs on doors. In the far-vision range, patients could make out the horizon line, houses, trees, and rivers. Cars were located based on their bright reflections, while at night one patient was able to recognize moving cars by their headlights.  It's obviously early days for the Alpha IMS. Following the nine-patient pilot, additional testing has begun at centers in the UK, Hong Kong, and Hungary, with a focus on discerning the long-term stability and safety of the implant.

As NBC News reports, the proposed doomsday scenario rests upon a particle believed to be the Higgs boson — the so-called ""God particle"" that CERN scientists discovered last summer. Scientists are still reluctant to confirm that the particle is indeed the elusive Higgs boson, a particle believed to give other subatomic particles their mass, though early results show that it fits all the requirements. According to a theoretician at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, these findings may also provide clues about how the universe will meet its end. ""an alternate universe will appear somewhere, and it will spread out and destroy us."" Speaking at a meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in Boston yesterday, theoretical physicist Joseph Lykken said that the mass of the Higgs-like particle, when coupled with existing data on other subatomic particles, suggest that our universe is currently in an unstable state, and that it will eventually be swallowed by another alternate universe.  ""If you use all the physics that we know now, and we do what we think is a straightforward calculation, it's bad news,"" Lykken said. ""It may be that the universe we live in is inherently unstable. At some point, billions of years from now, it's all going to be wiped out."" ""The universe wants to be in a different state, so eventually to realize that, a little bubble of what you might think of as an alternate universe will appear somewhere, and it will spread out and destroy us."" ""We are still safe for billions of years."" This scenario has long been a subject of scientific debate, though the Higgs boson's mass (about 126 billion electron volts) lends the theory new weight. The good news, however, is that such a catastrophe would unfold at the speed of light, meaning that any life forms still around at that time won't even see it coming. And although theory suggests that the event could happen at any moment, it would likely unfurl far away from us, giving the universe plenty of breathing room.     ""The bubble forms through an unlikely quantum fluctuation, at a random time and place,"" Lykken told NPR. ""So in principle it could happen tomorrow, but then most likely in a very distant galaxy, so we are still safe for billions of years before it gets to us.""",0.5745944786860233,0.4254055213139767,0.24209290783384899,420,4.8619047619047615,247,5.7530364372469638,0,0,Science,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The farmer, 75-year-old Vernon Hugh Bowman, attempted to grow two soybean crops on his farm beginning in 1999. The first crop was Monsanto's patented genetically modified soybeans, which are resistant to the company's weed-killer chemical Roundup. Then Bowman planted another crop using cheaper mixed soybean seeds purchased from a grain elevator, which are usually used for livestock feed and not grown for human consumption. But many of the seeds Bowman bought from the grain elevator also contained Monsanto's patented genetic modifications, and though the company can't stop farmers from selling their leftover Monsanto seeds to grain elevators, it does have agreements prohibiting its customers from saving its seeds from year to year. Because he acquired Monsanto's seeds through this cheaper resale channel and grew them in the same fashion as seeds bought direct from Monsanto, the company sued Bowman for patent infringement, winning an $84,000 judgment in Indiana district court in 2007. Monsanto has sued hundreds of other small farmers for the same reason, and many have settled, but Bowman's is the first case to be heard by the nation's highest court. Monsanto has sued hundreds of other small farmers for the same reason In the Monsanto case, the Supreme Court of the United States is looking to answer two main questions:  Did Monsanto lose its right to tell Bowman how to use the seeds he bought from the grain elevator because he bought them secondhand? Or should bioengineered seeds receive a special extension of patent protection because they are ""self-replicating""? should bioengineered seeds receive a special extension of patent protection because they are ""self-replicating""? With Bowman's case just one of two major biotech cases the Supreme Court is due to hear early this year — in April, it will hear a case on the legality of another company's claim to the patent on genetic mutations that lead to ovarian and breast cancers, which an Australian court just ruled to be legal — companies with large intellectual property holdings could have much to gain or lose over microscopically tiny genetic property.",0.7146623252419517,0.2853376747580483,0.8801847581757173,398,5.2185929648241203,219,5.9315068493150687,0,0,"Policy & Law, Science",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

So if we're serious about hacking the body to provide new kinds of sense experiences, forget about the fingertips. Forget anything on the outside of the skull. The answer is obvious: trick out your tongue. The Tongueduino is the brainchild of MIT Media Lab's Gershon Dublon.

In principle, this could allow blind or deaf users to ""see"" or ""hear"" with their tongues, or augment the body with extrahuman senses.

Chinese regulators banned financial institutions from using Bitcoin earlier this month, while in July, Thailand's government declared the virtual currency's use illegal due to a lack of applicable laws. Now Bitcoin has taken another hit to its legitimacy: Norway — Scandinavia's richest nation — has said that the currency doesn't qualify as real money. Norway's director general of taxation, Hans Christian Holte, said the currency ""doesn't fall under the usual definition of money."" The Norwegian government instead decreed Bitcoin to be an asset upon which capital gains tax can be charged. Bloomberg News says profits from Bitcoin will fall under the wealth tax, and that losses can be deducted. Holte also said there will be a 25 percent sales tax for businesses. For now the new rules will apply to Norwegian Kristoffer Koch, whose $27 investment in the fledgling currency was worth $886,000 in October, but his home country's decision may not be final: Holte is reportedly planning to work with other nations to work out the legalities of the new currency. Norway's government is planning to work on the legalities of Bitcoin with other countries Earlier this year the German government reached a similar decision, classifying Bitcoin as ""Rechnungseinheiten,"" or ""units of account."" That definition put Bitcoin at a similar standing to a regional currency. The French government was more accepting of the virtual currency earlier in the year — allowing the foundation of Bitcoin-Central, a real bank that allows customers to deposit and transfer money in both euros and bitcoins — but changed its course this month with the Bank of France issuing a warning about the financial risks of the currency. The legalities of Bitcoin are still fuzzy That warning was echoed by the European Banking Authority last week, which issued a document reminding consumers of the dangers of virtual currency. People using virtual currencies such as Bitcoin should, according to the EBA, ""fully understand their specific characteristics and not use ‘real' money that they cannot afford to lose."" Outside of the EU, the legalities of Bitcoin are still fuzzy. Many Bitcoin dealers in the US are not compliant with American law, and even Bank of America, once positive about the currency's future, is worried about a governmental crackdown. Speaking to Bloomberg News, associate professor of financial economics at the BI Norwegian Business School Paul Ehling said Norway's definition of money could be shortsighted. Ehling spoke about currencies in history, saying ""if it's accepted by a sufficiently large population, then that's enough."" But Ehling also thinks Norway's cautious approach to the new currency stems from its ephemeral and volatile nature. ""If there's a crisis or power outage, you need some bills in your wallet in case your credit card doesn't work — same goes with bitcoins.""

Speaking with Forbes, an alleged NSA employee who knew him says that co-workers viewed Snowden as both smart and trustworthy. ""That kid was a genius among geniuses,"" the anonymous NSA employee tells Forbes. ""NSA is full of smart people, but anybody who sat in a meeting with Ed will tell you he was in a class of his own … I've never seen anything like it.""  ""[Snowden] was in a class of his own."" The employee, whose comments Forbes reportedly confirmed with Snowden's ACLU lawyer, says that Snowden impressed NSA officials by frequently reporting security vulnerabilities and by developing what has now become a widely used backup system. At one point, Snowden was reportedly even offered a position on the NSA's Tailored Access Operations group — a secret team of highly skilled hackers — but ultimately turned the job down. Nonetheless, Forbes reports that Snowden's technical abilities were enough to land him access to nearly any NSA data he could want, even as a contractor. While it wasn't until spring this year that Snowden's leaked NSA documents came out, he reportedly voiced his concerns over the agency's activities before then — albeit much more quietly. Forbes reports that Snowden used to wear a sweatshirt to work that satirized the agency's activities: sold by the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the sweatshirt's back depicted a parody NSA logo that replaced the American shield with an AT&T data box that had wires spilling out of it and into the talons of an eagle. Forbes also reports that Snowden kept a copy of the Constitution at his desk so that he could cite it when arguing against activities he thought might violate US law. Regardless of what co-workers used to think of Snowden, the NSA's public line has been to criticize his activities ever since he was identified as the source of the leaks. In an interview last night, NSA agents called his work behavior ""strange"" and noted that he was a high school dropout. Even so, Snowden's abilities were reportedly enough to make up for these smaller signs of resistance — and his lack of security clearances. The alleged NSA employee suggests to Forbes that Snowden was likely granted access to files beyond his security clearance simply because he could get work done that others couldn't: ""If you had a guy who could do things nobody else could, and the only problem was that his badge was green instead of blue, what would you do?""",0.34099216077590655,0.6590078392240935,0.8325561967167904,452,4.8738938053097343,263,5.6806083650190118,0,0,"US & World, National Security",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

Opening with the disclosure that CBS correspondent John Miller formerly worked in the office of the director of National Intelligence, the program prompted NSA director Keith Alexander and other agents to reiterate the agency's usual talking points about bulk surveillance.   ""The fact is, we're not collecting everybody's email, we're not collecting everybody's phone things, we're not listening to that,"" Alexander said. But the focus on actively listening to phone calls is a red herring; the NSA has not been accused of doing that. The agency instead collects metadata from every phone call placed within the United States — something the government argues is harmless and exempt from constitutional protections. That argument is highly controversial with privacy advocates since the bulk collection of metadata can reveal much more about a person than even the contents of some communications. Among his slippery answers, Alexander denied a damning Washington Post report from October which claimed the NSA was secretly tapping into the internal traffic of Google and Yahoo without permission in order to access data before it became encrypted. ""We are outraged at the lengths to which the government seems to have gone to intercept data from our private fiber networks, and it underscores the need for urgent reform,"" Google's chief legal officer David Drummond told The Verge. Tonight, Alexander appears to have deflected those claims, telling CBS that ""we're not going into a facility or targeting Google as an entity or Yahoo as an entity."" ""A 20-something-year-old high school dropout contractor managed to walk out with the crown jewels."" The interview also featured an extensive attempt by NSA agents to discredit former contractor Edward Snowden. Snowden, who leaked documents this year revealing the extent of the telephone-records program and other efforts like PRISM, was described by CBS' John Miller as a ""20-something-year-old high school dropout contractor."" Discussing the NSA's visit to Snowden's former Hawaii home, Rick Ledgett, the agency's head of an Edward Snowden task force, said he ""couldn't bring himself"" to sit in Snowden's chair. ""He would work on the computer with a hood that covered the computer screen and covered his head and shoulders, so that he could work and his girlfriend couldn't see what he was doing.""

Today, Judge Richard Leon granted a preliminary injunction to Verizon customers Larry Klayman and Charles Strange, saying that they were suffering harm from having his records collected and that he had made a strong case that the NSA's secret court orders, which require carriers to provide metadata on virtually all US phone calls, were likely to violate the fourth amendment. Leon ordered the government to cease collecting any metadata from the plaintiffs and destroy any that remained in surveillance databases. Practically speaking, that order doesn't change much, since that order has been delayed to allow the government time to file an appeal. But his decision also, vitally, allows the case to proceed. Judge Leon cites an 'utter lack of evidence' that bulk metadata collection stops terrorists In his opinion, Leon cites the huge pool of numbers that could be included in the three ""hops"" that analysts are allowed to make beyond a single suspicious number, as well as the mistakes, misconduct, and obfuscations described in declassified documents from the FISA court. He also says that there's little evidence the metadata collection is doing much good and complaining of the ""utter lack of evidence that a terrorist attack has ever been prevented because searching the NSA database was faster than other investigative tactics,"" despite claims to the contrary from the intelligence community. If that evidence is lacking, the NSA can't argue that the usefulness of having the database on hand — rather than sending orders for individual cases to phone companies — outweighs the consequences to American privacy. Most importantly, he says that the NSA's policy has direct harmful effects on Verizon subscribers because it violates their constitutional rights — a marked contrast from previous rulings. That's partly because Leon determined that an important case involving telephone metadata no longer applies in a world in which your phone can track almost every aspect of your life. ""The Government, in its understandable zeal to protect our homeland, has crafted a counterterrorism program with respect to telephone metadata that strikes the balance based in large part on a thirty-four-year-old Supreme Court precedent, the relevance of which has been eclipsed by technological advances and a cellphone-centric lifestyle heretofore inconceivable,"" he writes. The decision he's talking about is Smith v. Maryland, a landmark case involving less than a week of surveillance of one subject's landline in the 1970s. ""Candor of this type defies common sense."" The Obama administration has argued that Smith v. Maryland means collecting metadata can't be defined as a search, ruling out one constitutional claim. Another part of its argument hinges on the idea that there's no way any individual plaintiff can say whether or not they were surveilled, an argument that successfully shot down lawsuits before a leaked court order showing the extent of the data collection. Leon specifically addresses one failed suit by Amnesty International, decided months before the leak. But ""whereas the plaintiffs in Clapper could only speculate as to whether they would be surveilled at all, plaintiffs in this case can point to strong evidence that, as Verizon customers, their telephony metadata has been collected."" Leon has strong words for the administration, which he says ""wants it both ways"" by arguing that the court order only refers to Verizon's business wing. As he writes: ""Virtually all of the government's briefs and arguments to this court explain how the government has acted in good faith to create a comprehensive metadata database that serves as a potentially valuable tool in combating terrorism — in which case NSA must have collected metadata from Verizon Wireless, the single largest wireless carrier in the United States. Yet in one footnote, the government asks me to find that plaintiffs lack standing based on the theoretical possibility that the NSA has collected a universe of metadata so incomplete that the program could not possibly serve its putative function. Candor of this type defies common sense and does not exactly inspire confidence!"" This case is similar to an ACLU lawsuit that also seeks the end of the NSA's bulk data collection. Filed in New York, the case took its first major step forward in late November, when a judge heard arguments from both sides. The collection has also been challenged in Congress and by a White House review panel. The USA Freedom Act, sponsored by Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT) and Representative Jim Sensenbrenner (R-WI), would explicitly narrow the application of Section 215, the rule under which the NSA collects data. A panel appointed by Obama to review the intelligence community's operations, meanwhile, is allegedly recommending that the NSA cease its bulk collection. If any of these attempts succeed, the NSA will still be able to request specific records from a phone company, and its many other surveillance programs will likely not be affected, nor will its surveillance of non-US citizens. Update: Edward Snowden, the former NSA contractor who leaked many details about the existence and scope of the NSA's phone metadata collection efforts last summer, released a statement to The New York Times this afternoon celebrating the judge's decision. As Snowden writes: ""I acted on my belief that the N.S.A.'s mass surveillance programs would not withstand a constitutional challenge, and that the American public deserved a chance to see these issues determined by open courts. Today, a secret program authorized by a secret court was, when exposed to the light of day, found to violate Americans’ rights. It is the first of many.""",0.5826684667447218,0.41733153325527816,0.8542305336728839,924,5.3084415584415581,483,6.5797101449275361,0,0,"Policy & Law, US & World, National Security",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

A new interactive e-waste map, created by the UN partnership organization StEP Initiative, shows that the volume of our e-waste, or any disposed item with an electrical cord or battery, is growing. And the international challenge of exporting and recycling them isn't being sufficiently addressed. According to data collected by the StEP Initiative, the annual world volume of end-of-life electronics is expected to jump one-third to 65.4 million tons by 2017. That's a 33 percent jump, in five years, of the refrigerators, TVs, mobile phones, computers, e-toys, and other electronics people around the world have used and discarded. That's enough information to make your head spin, but this new map makes all that data easier to process. Click on a continent and a country and you'll see an overview of the country's e-waste statistics, as well as any rules it has to regulate the waste. In a statement, Ruediger Kuehr of United Nations University and executive secretary of the StEP Initiative said researchers hope the map will spur countries to handle their e-waste, in addition to raising awareness among the general public.  The U.S. produces 9.4 million tons of e-waste per year Unfortunately, the stats show that the US isn't the picture of perfect e-waste management. We have the largest amount of total e-waste per year, coming in at 9.4 million tons. China comes in second with 7.3 million tons, but its number is surprisingly low when it comes to e-waste generated by an individual per year, with each citizen averaging 5.4kg of e-waste. Americans produce an average of 29.8kg each per year. While some countries have instituted recycling plans to tackle their e-waste, others prefer to ship all of it away. A study funded by the EPA and released by MIT's Materials Systems Laboratory and the US National Center for Electronics Recycling looked at the collection and export of used electronics in 2010. There were a total of 258.2 million units collected in the US and of those, two-thirds were reused or recycled and 8.5 percent of the remaining units were exported. Believe it or not, that 8.5 percent is on the low end, and that's possibly due to restrictive trading regulations between nations. This is a step in the right direction, if we believe that knowledge is power. There haven't been many studies in the past that look into e-waste management and transboundary movement, so this new map helps surface key facts — hopefully before we all drown in a sea of used cell phones.",0.713282866623171,0.286717133376829,0.22681005240667404,439,4.952164009111617,262,5.9770992366412212,0,0,US & World,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

What we haven’t see thus far is a copy of Aaron Sorkin’s screenplay — but there’s plenty of new information about the project, including what director David Fincher thought when he first read the script. Though the filmmaker was never able to close a deal to direct the adaptation (Danny Boyle will now take on the movie over at Universal, with Prometheus star Michael Fassbender reportedly playing the title role), in a February email he was beyond enthusiastic: The latter is a reference to Lenny, Bob Fosse's 1974 biopic about comedian Lenny Bruce that starred Dustin Hoffman and was adapted from the stage play of the same name. Even after Fincher deal started falling apart, Sorkin continued to lobby for the director despite friction during Fincher’s negotiation. ""I do not know why he’s like this (anymore than I know why Steve Jobs was like Steve Jobs),"" Sorkin wrote to Sony Pictures head Amy Pascal and producer Scott Rudin on March 27th, just weeks before the director dropped out, ""and I don’t want this movie to be a bitter drink for the people at the top because you all have other things you can do and you’ll just walk away. But we’re looking at a home run pitch coming at us."" ""It’s a play, but a really quicksilver, cinematic one."" The emails also contain passing glimpses at the project Sorkin’s put together. He said as far back as 2012 that his script would consist of three major scenes, and in another March email he writes that the film would require just four locations to shoot: ""two auditoriums, a restaurant and a garage."" (What will one of those auditoriums be? In an email from last month, Sorkin directly references Symphony Hall — the San Francisco venue where Steve Jobs held the first NeXT introduction event.) No matter what ups and downs the Jobs project has faced, it’s pretty clear that one person is going to be happy with the finished product: Steve Jobs author Walter Isaacson. After reading the script, Isaacson gushed to Rudin in a February email. ""The script is totally awesome. I have a tear in my eye having just finished. I was deeply moved by the narrative arc and by the beautiful end. I loved the line, ‘No way she’s not my kid,’"" he wrote, in what seems to be a clear reference to Jobs’ daughter Lisa Brennan-Jobs.

I tend to believe that she should pursue whatever sound she wants to pursue, but I get the frustration with the fact that the massive popularity of 2012's ""Starships"" would inevitably overshadow her more out-there stuff; that it would become the first Nicki song you think of instead of, say, ""I Get Crazy.""

So find a few minutes, scroll down, and make your way through the best of what was out there, from huge films like Mad Max to beautiful stories like The Little Prince.   It's been well over a year since Pixar's last movie, but the wait for a new one is almost over. Inside Out is a movie that literally brings you inside of its characters' heads, and Pixar released a first real look at the film this week. It'll be out on June 19th.   Just try to find a cooler trailer than this. Mad Max is making one heck of a triumphant return next year, and this trailer shows how wild and gorgeous of a ride it'll be. It's out next summer.   It's that time of year again. The Doctor Who Christmas special is coming out, as you'd expect, on Christmas day. Its trailer was just released yesterday, and naturally, Santa is involved.   If the Terminator Genisys trailer taught us anything, it's that the best way to make an unnecessary sequel to a time travel movie may be to make everything as crazy as possible. That might just work out here: the trailer for Hot Tub Time Machine 2 revels in the ridiculous possibilities of time travel in the hands of three strange men, including how poorly it can go for them. It'll be out on February 20th.   Here's all you need to know: The Gunman  is directed by the same guy who directed Taken. Have fun.   This trailer has quite the cover of ""California Dreamin'."" It also has California totally being ripped apart by an earthquake, and The Rock tasked with saving whoever he can amid the chaos. Mostly, he just makes vacant gazes at the destruction, but this is clearly going to be one huge disaster flick. It'll be in theaters May 29th.      Paul Thomas Anderson's latest film is just about here. The movie, an adaptation of Thomas Pynchon's novel of the same name, doesn't make any sense, but instead jumps betweens all sorts of outlandish scenarios and characters, as you may well glean from this trailer. The film is starting to play this Saturday, and it'll open wide on January 9th.   Kingsman: The Secret Service has a bizarrely understated title. This isn't a dry secret agent movie, nor is it a cookie-cutter action flick: rather, it's a wild, over-the-top send-up of those genres that actually looks like it could be a lot of fun. It'll be out on February 13th.   You aren't going to be able to see this movie for a little while, but you may want to; The Visit is a documentary-style film that follows how the world's top scientists and space agencies would react to Earth's first contact with alien life. You'll be able to hear a lot more about The Visit when it premieres at Sundance in January.   Watch out for flying text. The Walk is Robert Zemeckis' re-telling of tightrope walker Philippe Petit's daring (and illegal) performance between the Twin Towers back in 1974 — a story you may have already seen on camera in the documentary Man on Wire. It's a wonderful story, even if this trailer makes it look like the results have turned out kind of ridiculous. Joseph Gordon-Levitt stars, and it'll be out next October.   Even if you don't speak French, you'll want to watch this trailer: The Little Prince is getting an animated adaptation, and it looks downright gorgeous. We're looking forward to seeing more.   Certain Verge staffers flip out when they hear Anna Kendrick singing, so here it is, the trailer for the adaptation of the musical The Last Five Years. It'll be out next year.   Is anyone not watching Girls? The show is super smart and super funny, so short of not having an HBO subscription, there's no reason not to have at least checked it out. Its fourth season starts on January 11th.   Still Alice is apparently generating a bit of Oscar buzz for Julianne Moore this year, which maybe shouldn't be a surprise since she's such a consistently great actor anyway. The film, based on a popular novel, has her playing an Alzheimer’s patient and dealing with the impact on her work and family life. It'll be out widely in January.   This is not quite Homeward Bound. White God is about a girl and her lost dog trying to reconnect, but it's also about a canine uprising and political tensions throughout Europe. The film won a big prize at Cannes earlier this year, and you'll be able to see it in the US on March 27th.",0.581234808786144,0.418765191213856,0.17906386023685528,817,4.3586291309669525,440,5.6590909090909092,0,0,"Culture, Entertainment",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

The company has spent months talking up the plethora of colors and class-leading brightness that can be produced by the nano-cystal semiconductors in these sets, claiming that the output is far superior to anything consumers will see from the competition. Soon enough, you'll get to take a look for yourself. And remember that Samsung has switched up the software on its TVs this year; these are all running Tizen and powered by an octacore processor. Is that overkill for a TV? Perhaps, but hopefully it means you won't see lag when flipping through your picture settings or accessing Samsung's ""smart"" features. And Samsung is once again trying to future proof the higher-end, curved models with what it calls the One Connect box, which stores the TV's ""brains"" and can be swapped out in future years for more powerful chips and new technology standards. None of these are what you'd call inexpensive But again, these aren't inexpensive TVs. The top of the line JS9500 Curved SUHD line starts at $6,499.99 and is set to arrive this month. Samsung's not trying to compete with Vizio's cutthroat 4K pricing, though. The company is betting that consumers will pay more for the picture quality advancements and features like ""Auto Depth Enhancer,"" which Samsung claims ""analyzes images across the display and automatically adjusts contrast for a greater sense of depth."" But across the line, thing never really get much cheaper. The J9100 series only comes in a 78-inch model that's priced at $9,999.99. It's only when you go flat that things get more affordable; the JS8500 series runs $2,999.99 for a 55-inch TV and $3,999.99 for 65 inches of SUHD glory. Those are available right now. Once you get below that, you hit Samsung's ""regular"" UHD 4K curved sets. The most inexpensive of the bunch is the JU6700 series, which starts at $949.99 (40-inch), with bigger models — which you'd want for 4K content — priced at $1,499.99 (55-inch) and $2,699.99 (65-inch), respectively. Samsung's being vague about a release date on those, only saying ""this spring."" Keep in mine the farther down you drop in Samsung's new TV family, the more fancy picture enhancements you lose out on. Whether or not your eyes will notice any difference is for you to decide. Samsung is also rolling out curved soundbars to go along with its curved TVs. These are basically paired according to screen size. Opt for Samsung's largest sets, and the company suggests the HW-J8500 — capable of 350 watt output — for $1,299.99. (That's a whole lot to pay for a soundbar, though Sony's proven that the investment can be worth it.)

But the company is growing up now, with advertisers and media partners as well as an ever-expanding user base — so the company today announced a number of initiatives to show that it takes its users data and privacy seriously. Perhaps the most noteworthy change is that Snapchat has now blocked all access from third-party apps. According to Steven Levy at Backchannel, Snapchat has been working for months to make it harder for third-party apps to access Snapchat data, and now the company believes it has successfully closed that hole entirely. Snapchat never published its APIs, but some developers had hacked together ways to write apps that support Snapchat's features. This came to a head last October when a third-party Snapchat app leaked tens of thousands of supposedly private user photos. Snapchat wants its users to believe it takes their security very seriously That shouldn't be possible anymore, and it also means that Windows Phone users won't be able to use any of the third-party apps they've relied on to use Snapchat thus far. That said, Snapchat has been cracking down and getting third-party apps removed from all the major app stores for a while now — the company vowed to do so after last October's mishap. Beyond the new third-party restrictions, Snapchat also joined the ranks of many other major technology companies in publishing its first-ever transparency report, which details all of the data requests the company receives from governments around the world. While it's commendable for Snapchat to make such info freely available, there's not a whole lot of note in its first report. The company received 375 requests from the US government covering 666 separate accounts from November 1st, 2014 through February 28th, 2015. Internationally, the company received 28 requests for 35 accounts. Snapchat says it'll be updating this report bi-annually. Beyond these specific changes is simply the message that Snapchat takes your privacy seriously, something that wasn't as clear in the past — something that the company wasn't as up front about when dealing with past security issues. ""We actually consider it a competitive advantage that we care that much about users' privacy and security,"" Snapchat's Tim Sehn told Levy. ""We care enough to delete their data. That is something that most companies don't do because that data is valuable.""

In a post on the company's security blog, Google announced it would no longer be registering new HTTPS certificates from the China Internet Network Information Center (or CNNIC), effectively cutting the registrar out of the SSL system that secures the web. HTTPS certificates are used to ensure that web content cannot be intercepted in transit, typically expressed as a padlock symbol next to the browser address bar, and CNNIC handles that process for the whole Chinese web, so it's a move that could have real consequences for Google and China going forward. ""The decision that Google has made is unacceptable and unintelligible."" According to Google, the move is a direct result of bad behavior on CNNIC's part. In March, one of CNNIC's certificates was used by an Egyptian web company to perform a man-in-the-middle attack, and after an investigation, Google concluded CNNIC wasn't being careful enough in how its certificates were used. CNNIC has protested the decision, and is promising that users would be unaffected. ""The decision that Google has made is unacceptable and unintelligible to CNNIC,"" the center said in a statement, ""and meanwhile CNNIC sincerely urge that Google would take users’ rights and interests into full consideration."" The move isn't as bad news for China as it sounds. CNNIC's old certificates will still work, and while it won't be able to issue new ones right away, the center is already working through Google's Certificate Transparency process to recertify itself. The Chinese government has actively discouraged the use of HTTPS by many Chinese web companies as a way to reinforce the Great Firewall, and as a result, CNNIC's share of the certificate market is quite small, representing less than .1 percent of the certificates used on the web. The move comes at a particularly fraught time for the Chinese web, on the heels of a string of DDoS attacks against Github and GreatFire.org's mirror sites, believed to have been directed by the Great Firewall. It's unusual that a single company would make such a move unilaterally, and underscores Google's increasingly central place in maintaining the security of SSL for the web at large. Chrome is so widely used that changing its settings is enough to force most certificate authorities to adopt better practices, completely independent of the larger web of trust. A similar dynamic was at work this February as companies scrambled to delist bad certificates established by Lenovo's Superfish adware. In the end, most of the bad certificates were caught by Microsoft's Windows Defender, simply because of the broad reach of the program.",0.3019736944912224,0.6980263055087776,0.7644349864201997,437,5.1830663615560644,249,6.3453815261044175,0,0,"Google, Tech",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Yesterday, at the 2013 Annual Meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in Boston, Micera revealed the results of a four-week trial from 2009 in which an earlier prototype of the hand was attached to an amputee named Pierpaolo Petruzziello. Intraneural electrodes implanted into his arm allowed him to communicate with — and receive information from — the prosthetic, though the device wasn't attached directly to his arm for the trial. Petruzziello was able to move the bionic hand's fingers and grasp items (see video below), and he reported that he could feel when it was pricked with needles. The trial reinforced researchers' findings that they could decode nerve signals received from the brain to control the prosthetic, and that they could send senses of feeling back to the brain.     Now, researchers have announced plans for a new clinical trial in which an unnamed Italian man in his 20s who lost his arm in an accident will have a new prototype of the device attached to his body for a month. The new version provides sensory feedback from the fingers, palm, and wrists, according to a report from The Independent. Like the previous trial, wires from the electrodes that provide communication between the subject and the prosthetic will be external, and it isn't safe for the patient to be connected for more than a month.

When physicists discover new properties of matter, it usually means better technologies for the rest of us. Superconductors, liquid crystal displays like the ones found in most TVs now, medical imaging technologies that allow doctors to peer inside the human body, and magnetic levitation — which was used to create the Shanghai Maglev train — are all examples of how discoveries of new properties of matter have resulted in revolutionary products.  Now, physicists have discovered another new property of matter that could lead to a new generation of innovation. Physicists are always on the lookout for new ways electrons can push each other around For the past 25 years, physicists observed a persistent glitch while conducting experiments that involved cooling a uranium compound to near absolute zero. When the compound, URu2Si2, was cooled to -428 degrees Fahrenheit, they would see a fall in the amount of chaos in the system. The molecules seemed to snap into an ordered state, letting out a burst of heat the scientists couldn't account for. Where did this extra heat come from? The likely answer, which was detailed in a paper published January 30th in Nature by Rutgers physics professors Piers Coleman, Premala Chandra and MIT postdoc Rebecca Flint, comes from the observation that this material was undergoing a phase transition (similar to how water undergoes a phase transition when it becomes ice) but at the quantum level, reflecting a property of matter that was previously unknown. In the quest to find new materials with exotic properties such as superconductivity, physicists are always on the lookout for new ways electrons can push each other around. For example, last week scientists announced they'd created a new kind of solar cell by discovering new electronic properties using a large-scale computer simulation. To discover properties that occur under more extreme conditions, theoretical physicists like Coleman write the equations that are sent over to experimental physicists who run tests using devices like the Large Hadron Collider to see if they hold up. ""Along the way, we sometimes stumble across something amazing like high temperature superconductivity, which works well for levitating trains,"" Coleman said. New physical properties are characterized by breaks in physical symmetries, which we can see in everyday things. If you rotate a sphere around its axis, it looks the same at every point in the rotation — but if you rotate a cube this way, it only looks the same every 90 degrees of rotation. Therefore, a cube breaks continuous rotational symmetry. Magnets exemplify a broken symmetry that is a bit more difficult to envision because it breaks what physicists call ""time-reversal"" symmetry. This is the idea that the motion of particles looks the same running back and forth in time, ""like running a movie backwards and forward,"" Coleman offered as a comparison. With magnets, if you run the movie backwards, the magnetic field produced reverses direction. You have to reverse time twice to get it back to its original state. Hopefully this will involve teleportation, time travel, and more lasers What the scientists observed was happening with this extremely cold uranium compound was that the substance was breaking double time-reversal symmetry — twice as complex as our magnet example. The physicists have dubbed this new property ""hastatic order"" after the ancient Latin word for ""spear,"" which is what the particles resemble in this ordered state. Obviously there's no time-reversal machine to test this in, but data from particle colliders in the US and Japan has backed this theory. It's kind of like finding the square root of -1: it technically doesn't exist, but mathematically it helps solve all kinds of problems. ""It turns out that particles in nature divide into two categories. One has a property that when you time-reverse it, it comes back to itself,"" Coleman explained, like a marble completing a lap around a circular track. ""Others, only when you time reverse it twice does it come back to itself."" Electrons have this property, the physical analogy for which is rolling a marble along a Möbius strip. One revolution brings it to the same place, but in an upside down orientation. Ars Technica writes about another good example. The new theory of order, which involves the spin of electrons, breaks double time reversal symmetry and exhibits quadruple time reversal symmetry.

Consumer electronics, silicon, and health care are a few major areas where nanotechnology could provide major advances in the future, but those aren't the only places where it can make an impact — researchers at UCLA recently used nanotechnology to create a ""booze pill"" that lowers the intoxication level of lab rats. While it may take years for the nanotech findings to make their way into consumer-facing products, this research may lend a clue as to what kind of technology we have to look forward to. Researchers in California have developed a way to quickly reduce the blood alcohol levels of drunken mice, potentially paving the way for a so-called ""booze pill"" that would instantaneously combat intoxication. The study, led by UCLA professor Yunfeng Lu and USC's Cheng Ji, involves the combination of two enzymes, wrapped in a nanoscale shell. Drunken mice injected with this enzyme nanocapsule saw their alcohol levels drop significantly faster than those in the control group. IBM has helped to develop a new substance it says will aid in the fight against deadly infections. Superbugs like MRSA cause thousands of deaths per year thanks to their resistance to traditional antibiotics. MRSA, for example, can survive and multiply in ""biofilms"" — extra-cellular matrixes that can thrive on virtually any surface. Hospitals can kill MRSA using traditional disinfectants, but such ethanol- and bleach-based substances evaporate rapidly and aren't ideal for application to skin. Researchers from MIT's Microsystems Technology Laboratories claim to have created the smallest transistor ever to be made out of a material other than silicon. The transistor is made of indium gallium arsenide, a material already used in fiber-optic and radar technologies, and is just 22 nanometers thick — the size of about nine strands of human DNA. Because this is the same type of transistor typically used in microprocessors, it could mean more densely packed — and consequently higher... Researchers at IBM's T.J. Watson Research Center claim to have made a breakthrough in chip-manufacturing technology, according to a recent study published in Nature Nanotechnology.

To achieve this, a silicon wafer is coated in hydrogen, before individual hydrogen atoms are lifted away using STM. The wafer is then... Battery life is a huge issue for smartphone users, and 2012 seems to be the year that manufacturers are taking notice.

Forget lie detectors: one company is now selling a device that they say can look straight into your brain to see whether or not you know revealing details of a crime. If it works, it'd be an incredible law enforcement tool. But if the science isn't there to back it up — and it may not be — we could be letting a dangerous new tool into the courtroom.

The New RepublicAnn Friedman reviews Kim Gordon’s new memoir, Girl in a Band, recounting how the former Sonic Youth bassist defined an era in music, despite creative and personal struggles. If anything, Girl in a Band fits into the grudge-bearing category of music memoir. Although Gordon devotes pages to her opinions on art and music and includes fascinating descriptions of what it’s like to be onstage—""an intense, hyper-real dream, where you step off a cliff but don’t fall to your death""—her life as a girl in a band is ultimately inseparable from her life as a girl in a relationship, a very high-profile relationship that ended very badly. In the book, she’s doing a bit of intentional score-settling, sure. But she’s also still angry about everything that happened. New York MagazineAdam Sternbergh explores the satisfaction that comes from a ""perfect response"": a zinger so effortless nothing could replace it. But perfect responses aren't a balm for poor communication: they merely reinforce what the listener already believes. As common as this idea has become, it’s truthfully much more common to find civilians online bemoaning some long, disjointed, and frustrating argument they had with a nutty anti-vaxxer on Facebook that ended in one or both of them pounding on their keyboard with barely suppressed rage. Or watching people duck as a firehose of insane hate-spew is loosed their way on Twitter. Troll wars are consistently fueled by people on both sides who suspect they are just one post away from finally launching that Perfect Response.

Vice Andrew Iwanicki describes taking part in a bed-rest study for NASA, which required him to lie tilted at a negative-six-degree angle for 10 weeks. The following weeks held few details of note. The days blurred together. I tried to avoid counting down my time left; rather, I measured my stay by my increasing sensitivity to the small, daily frustrations that were slowly chipping away at my mind. Why did I have to drink water out of an open glass, even though at the angle of my bed, it inevitably spilled all over my table and chest? Why did they serve soup in shallow bowls? Why were they serving soup to people in bed anyway? Did any of the staff have any idea what it was like to be stuck in bed?

It's not entirely clear why this decision was announced today, but it comes not long after The Wall Street Journal reported that a White House oversight panel planned to suggest that the two positions be separated. Since leaked documents began exposing the breadth of NSA surveillance this summer, the move has been suggested as a way to limit the NSA's reach. The move is partly practical, maintaining an existing policy and drawing on the NSA's technical capabilities; Alexander has held that keeping the two roles together is a good idea.

One of the longest held Americans in history Levinson's disappearance was reportedly brought about by a team of CIA analysts who, without the authority to authorize spy work, hired him to gather intelligence on the Iranian government.

The California-based filmmaker, real name Adam Pesapane, has become something of a stop-motion auteur since the debut of his first short, Roof Sex, in which two armchairs have sex on a roof. Since then, he's created viral hits like Western Spaghetti and the Oscar-nominated Fresh Guacamole, all in the same quirky aesthetic. In his universe, footballs are turned into cold cuts, dice become onions, and chairs give blowjobs. Today, PES released Submarine Sandwich, the third installment in his food-focused series of stop-motion shorts. Set in a recreated 1920s-era deli, the film follows a clerk (played by PES) as he wordlessly constructs a submarine sandwich from behind the counter. As in his earlier films, the cuts of meat are not actually meat, but vintage sports equipment that he spent years looking for on eBay, Craigslist, and at flea markets. A boxing glove is sliced into thin strips of ""ham"" (represented by pink napkins), and 1970s-era tube socks (provolone cheese) are cut into white baseball patches and spread across the sandwich.   It's clever, cute, and definitely weird, but PES says it's just the way he's always seen the world. He has vivid memories of going to the grocery store as a child and imagining avocados as grenades — a vision that became the basis for 2012's Fresh Guacamole. ""I don't know if anyone else sees this, but those avocados are just like grenades."" ""It’s just one of those little ideas, and everyone has these things that amuse you,"" PES said in a phone interview Tuesday from his studio in Santa Monica. ""For me, I use them as cornerstones for films because that’s my way of saying, 'hey this is really funny, I see this in the world and I don't know if anyone else sees this, but those avocados are just like grenades.'"" The film was crowdfunded through a Kickstarter campaign over the summer, and took seven months to shoot. But the seed was planted a few years earlier, when PES fell in love with an old meat slicer he saw on display at the MoMA in New York. He was struck by its muscular design, and began wondering what a PES deli would look like. He was already familiar with the menu — he grew up in New Jersey in an Italian-American family, and his aunt owned a deli there — but recreating the atmosphere would prove difficult. PES spent 18 months monitoring eBay for just the right deli cabinet, a 1920s-era piece from New York. He paid way too much for an old soccer ball in Peru, and scoured Los Angeles flea markets and sites like Etsy for any other memorabilia he could find. Once it was all collected, and with funding secured, he began the painstaking process of bringing it to life, one shot at a time.  PES works on Submarine Sandwich at his studio in Santa Monica. (PES) It's a long and arduous process, but PES says authenticity is critical to his work. His entire career, much like the medium in which he works, is predicated on meticulous attention to detail — everything from the sound of the meat slicer to the texture of his materials. In the promo video for his Kickstarter campaign, PES made a point of stressing that all of his films are completely free of computer-generated special effects. ""I like giant cutting boards that are scarred over 200 years, I like knives that I found in Mexico that were handmade in the 1800s."" ""I like touching things, I like handling things,"" he says. ""I like giant cutting boards that are scarred over 200 years, I like knives that I found in Mexico that were handmade in the 1800s. I like deli cabinets that have oak doors on the back and really creaky hinges. I like stuff, and I like the texture of stuff."" ""And so part of my films are about this sort of deification of stuff, and texture, and that beautiful thing about real life, versus that sanitary feeling that you often get from a computer.""  Now that Submarine Sandwich is behind him, PES plans to devote more time to other projects, both personal and commercial. He's shot several commercials over his career, and wants to create a TV series in the same style of his celebrated shorts. And although he says he's not opposed to trying new formats or technologies, he seems intent on exploring the same twisted reality he sees every day. ""I've always been a bit of a documentary filmmaker at heart,"" he says. ""I approach all my films as if they’re real, 100 percent believable. I’m just showing you, this is what happens if you cut a baseball, or two chairs are fucking on a roof and I happen to sneak up there and photograph them."" ""I’m treating it like it’s really happening and that heightens the absurdity of it.

Tambor has deservedly picked up a nomination for best actor in a comedy series. Birdman also scored big with Golden Globe nominations. The Michael Keaton-led comedy has earned seven nominations in all — more than any other film this year — including best comedy, best actor in a comedy, best director, best supporting actress, best supporting actor, and best original score.

Recode reports that locations sharing the data have become the target of attacks set in motion by Sony itself. According to two sources familiar with the matter, the company is using Amazon Web Services' data centers to flood the torrent files that contain the company's stolen information with bad seeders, in an attempt to slow download speeds and limit access to the sensitive files. Despite these efforts, the leakers have already adapted. This week, a number of torrents with Amazon Web Services trackers had comments indicating that the files were traps laid by Sony, and the latest information dump, released on Wednesday, was able to dodge the targeted attacks by using a different filename. ""AWS employs a number of automated detection and mitigation techniques to prevent the misuse of our services,"" an Amazon representative said in a statement. ""The activity being reported is not currently happening on AWS."" The attack was so sophisticated it would ""challenge even state government"" security Earlier this week, the assistant director of the FBI's cyberdivision said that the attack, which took place on November 24th, was sophisticated enough to breach 90 percent of internet defenses, Joe Demarest, speaking at a cybersecurity conference, said that the attack was so advanced that it would have been ""likely to challenge even state government"" network security. The FBI briefed Sony employees this week Despite strong links suggesting that North Korean hackers were behind the attack, Demarest said that the FBI was still unable to determine who was responsible for breaking into Sony Pictures' network. The malware used by the group behind the hack, which calls itself the ""Guardians of Peace,"" was written in Korean, and the method of attack bears resemblances to earlier attacks orchestrated by the totalitarian state.The country's government has denied involvement, but has shown approval for the strike, calling it ""a righteous deed."" Sony Pictures has called in outside help to combat the effects of the attack, scheduling a briefing between Sony employees and the FBI to take place this week, and hiring security forensics company Mandiant to investigate the breach. Kevin Mandia, Mandiant's CEO, said last weekend that the attack was an ""unprecedented"" strike for which Sony Pictures nor other companies ""could have been fully prepared."" 12/11 5:01pm: Updated to include comment from Amazon Web Services",0.41115330798658023,0.5888466920134198,0.8149490347437246,444,5.3828828828828827,263,6.5703422053231941,0,0,"Culture, Entertainment, Web",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

The US cable giant is today announcing a new 2Gbps broadband service, which it will start rolling out in Atlanta from next month. There's no price yet, but Comcast says it will be symmetrical — meaning you'll upload just as quickly as you can download — and it won't be limited ""just to certain neighborhoods."" Bringing fiber right to your home Doug Guthrie, Senior VP of Comcast Cable’s South Region, explains that the company's ""approach is to offer the most comprehensive rollout of multi-gigabit service to the most homes as quickly as possible."" That's in stark contrast to what Comcast was saying just a couple of years ago, when it dismissed Google's Fiber efforts as being excessive for most people's needs. To get connected, you'll need to be ""within close proximity"" of Comcast's fiber network and accept the installation of ""professional-grade"" equipment. That should hint at the likely high cost of Comcast's new offering, which can be interpreted as a residential extension of the multi-gigabit service that it already offers to businesses across the United States. Comcast plans to expand to other cities beyond Atlanta and will cover as many as 18 million American homes by the end of 2015. For much broader gigabit coverage, the company also says it's working on a 1Gbps service — matching the speed of Google Fiber — for 2016, which it says will be able to connect ""almost every customer in our footprint.""",0.6653475891402529,0.33465241085974706,0.7984884085014228,279,4.9175627240143367,177,5.8135593220338979,1,0,"Home, Tech",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Now, the Twitter-owned app has released its first update aimed at fixing these (and other) problems. Periscope version 1.0.1 turns off notifications for new followers by default and automatically puts broadcasts from people you know at the top of your Watch tab. The optional location sharing function has been tweaked to be less revealing (the map that shows users' whereabouts is now zoomed further out and less precise) and the app's maker says it's also improved performance on particularly busy streams and added a fix for when streams aren't tweeted. It also promises that an Android version is coming ""soon."" notable broadcasts include tours of national parks and a ballet class in Paris ""We launched Periscope a week ago and have been overwhelmed (in the best possible way) by the outpouring of excitement for the product,"" said the Periscope team in a blog post. ""We built Periscope to let people discover the world through someone else’s eyes and in just a matter of days have taken us all around the globe — to nearly every country in the world."" The team also highlighted some of the more notable broadcasts, including tours of Glacier National Park, a ballet class at Paris Opera, and a behind-the-scenes look at The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon. So far, the winds of hype seem to be in Periscope's favor. Interest in the app has already eclipsed early live-streaming frontrunner Meerkat, and this speedily-implemented update bodes well for Periscope's ability to respond to users' problems. But make no mistake, there will be lots more problems. Notification overload can't be solved by simply turning off messages for new followers, and even if the app can consistently find broadcasts people want to watch, how are users going to deal with all the data costs? Periscope is off to a good start, but there are some things you just can't fix in an update.

Well, HTC's latest phone goes one further — it's a direct repurposing of the 2014 flagship at a lower price point. The M8s appears almost identical to the M8, with the same 5-inch 1080p display and all-metal build, but it uses an eight-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 615 processor and swaps the 4-megapixel ""UltraPixel"" camera out for a more conventional 13-megapixel sensor. Unlike the M9, the M8s retains the secondary lens that enables focusing effects.  The M8s appears almost identical to the M8 The battery is 2840mAh, a slight bump on the M8's 2600mAh cell; there's 2GB of RAM; and the phone comes with 16GB of internal storage as standard alongside a microSD slot. It's slightly thicker than the original M8, coming in at 9.55mm thick versus the prior 9.4mm; both phones, however, weigh the same 160g. The M8s runs HTC's Sense 6.0 software atop Android 5.0 Lollipop, rather than the Sense Seven version introduced with the M9. The M8s will be available in silver, gold, and gunmetal gray, and for now at least the release will be limited to Europe. Exact regions and release dates haven't yet been made clear, but the phone will sell for £379.99 ($564) SIM-free in the UK. The original M8 sold for around £530 upon release, though it's worth noting you can now pick it up for less than the M8s today. Which model you go for could come down to camera preference; if this 13-megapixel model is similar to the one found in other mid-range HTC phones, it may at least be less mercurial than its unreliable (if occasionally impressive) UltraPixel forebear.

A grip, a mode dial, and a selfie-enabling screen Unlike other J-series 1 cameras, which often required a lot of menu-diving to access basic settings, the J5 has a traditional PASM dial to select exposure modes; a secondary command dial helps make adjustments. The screen is now tiltable for the first time, and flexes through a full 180 degrees for those all-important high-res selfies. The J5 has a fairly substantial grip, unlike its boxy predecessors, and Nikon has adopted the now-ubiquitous silver and black retro color scheme (all-black and silver/white options will also be available).  The 1-inch sensor (2.7x crop factor) has been upgraded to 20.8 megapixels from the J4’s 18.4, the autofocus system has 171 contrast-detect and 105 phase-detect points, and the camera features a new Expeed 5A processor that allows for 20 fps still shooting with continuous focus, or 60 fps with single focus. The J5 can also shoot 4K video, albeit only at 15 fps. Fast performance and solid image processing have always been a hallmark of the 1 cameras, for all their other faults, and the J5 should continue this.   But of course, the 1-inch sensor still remains far behind just about every mirrorless competitor, meaning the J5 shouldn’t be the camera of choice for anyone concerned with shallow depth of field, strong low-light performance, or the ability to mount lenses from other systems. And despite the lack of interchangeable lenses, Sony’s RX100 line of compact cameras remain great buys, with the same size and resolution sensor in smaller bodies with tiny collapsible zoom lenses that are faster than anything Nikon offers for the 1 series. Nikon is pricing the J5 aggressively, though: the basic kit with a 10-30mm f/3.5-5.6 lens will cost $499.95, while a double-lens kit adding a 30-110mm f/3.8-5.6 zoom will be $749.95. A $1,049.95 kit with a 10-100mm f/4-5.6 offers more flexibility in a single lens. No release date is available yet beyond ""soon."" ""I think we had bigger expectations."" ""It has, although it's certainly not up to our total expectations,"" Nikon senior technical manager Steve Heiner tells The Verge when asked whether the 1 series has performed well. ""I think we had bigger expectations. The problem is that we introduced this into a market where there were competitors."" Heiner says that Nikon ""doubled the market just by entering it"" in 2011, and believes the series has greater potential. ""I think in the long term we're going to continue to build out the Nikon 1 Nikkor lens line, and the more options that we make available will make these bodies and others offerings more and more attractive. So it is doing well. It could do better."" Although there are certainly stronger mirrorless offerings out there for enthusiasts from the likes of Fujifilm, Olympus, and Sony, the J5 might be worth a look if you prioritize speed, size, and simplicity in an interchangeable lens camera rather than pro-level image quality — not to mention affordability. It isn’t enough to convince that Nikon is taking the mirrorless market altogether seriously, but it’s by far the easiest 1 series camera to imagine people buying.

This crude prototype was chosen partly out of necessity (the Watch was developed on a tight deadline), but also because Apple knew that its first ever wearable would live or die on the strength of its user interface. this prototype allowed the designers to focus on the software Jerry-rigging an iPhone with a life-sized simulation of the Apple Watch's display allowed the product's designers to focus on the software, not the hardware, and figure out how core features like messaging and calendars would translate to the small screen. The team did, however, end up building a physical dongle to simulate the Watch's digital crown. ""In a sense,"" writes Wired's David Pierce, ""the first true Apple Watch prototype was, like 10,000 Kickstarter projects, just a weird iPhone case with a strange accessory sticking out of it."" It's not unusual either — Google Glass started life as little more than a smartphone strapped to the side of someone's head. Pierce's article reveals all sorts of interesting tidbits about the development of the Apple Watch, including the process by which the human interface team finessed the vibrations and sounds used for notifications. The designers turned to synesthetic methods, converting all manner of noises into prods and buzzes to find out what felt right on the wrist. Interestingly, the audio samples they used even included the sound of a lightsaber — an object that we already know is one of Jony Ive's many areas of expertise.

""Preliminary indications are that it was a meteorite rain,"" said an emergency official speaking to RIA-Novosti. ""We have information about a blast at 10,000-meter (32,800-foot) altitude. It is being verified."" There are conflicting reports on what happened: an emergency ministry spokeswoman told the Associated Press that there was a meteor shower, but another account given to Interfax reported a single meteorite. Citing a Russian Interior Ministry spokesperson, the AP said that over 500 people have been injured, many by broken glass, but that number has since risen to around 950.  Local accounts provided to Reuters tell of burning objects in the sky followed by huge blasts that shattered windows and set off car alarms. The video above shows a bright white streak recorded from a dash-mounted camera, and below we see and hear closer evidence of the blast, with the white streak in the sky leading to a massive explosion — be warned, the video is loud. Many Russian drivers keep cameras on their dashboard in order to ensure evidence in the event of a traffic incident.  It's unclear what could have caused the explosions. Unconfirmed reports from Russia Today, a less than reliable source at the best of times, suggest that a meteor was blown away by a surface-to-air missile salvo, but there's little evidence of that from the videos we're seeing. A writer at ScienceBlogs, attempting to explain the notorious Tunguska incident that occurred in Russia over a century ago, provided an account of how meteors could explode in the atmosphere, but it's little more than speculation in this case. Astronomer Phil Plait weighed in with his thoughts: My opinion: The meteor over Russia is real. Unrelated to #2012DA14. Probably disintegrated high over the ground.Waiting for more info.  Plait has followed up with a blog post on Slate in which he reiterates his belief that the incident has no connection to 2012 DA14, the asteroid set to make a 17,200-mile ""near miss"" with the Earth later today. This security camera footage shows the blinding effect on the ground below.   The Russian Academy of Science estimates that the meteor weighed 10 tons — about the same as eight cars — before it entered the Earth's atmosphere and began to break up. Update: New reports indicate the meteor was in fact much larger — in the neighborhood of 10,000 tons.

The rats were wired with a brain-machine interface that included an infrared detector — but the scientists implanted it in the part of the brain that typically processes the sense of touch. Initial training of the rats involved rewarding them with water when they successfully poked their nose into a port attached to a visible LED light. Then, over the course of a month, the researchers gradually replaced the LED lights with infrared lighting; those lights were picked up by sensors attached to the rats' foreheads that connect to the implant in the rat's brain. These rats have a sixth sense Initially, the rats' behavior indicated they were interpreting the signals as touch — but by the end of the month, the rats were successfully searching out and honing in on the infrared source by sweeping their heads left and right. Perhaps the biggest finding was that the rats' sense of touch was unaffected by the additional stimulus. ""When we recorded signals from the touch cortex of these animals, we found that although the cells had begun responding to infrared light, they continued to respond to whisker touch,"" said lead researcher Miguel Nicolelis. ""It was almost like the cortex was dividing itself evenly so that the neurons could process both types of information."" The fact that the rats' sense of touch was unaffected is probably the most exciting finding for the researchers, who envision a future where doctors could ""hijack"" one of a person's working senses to help aid one that is no longer functioning properly. The researchers gave the example of someone with a damaged visual cortex regaining sight thanks to a neuroprosthesis implanted in another part of the brain. While that would be a highly useful medical advance, it wouldn't surprise us if the biohackers out there were more interested in how this might eventually offer humans a way to have a sixth sense, just like the lab rats in this experiment.",0.42402512107519996,0.5759748789248,0.5438089494994028,357,5.0028011204481793,203,6.1034482758620694,0,0,Science,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

As reported by Wired UK, scientists developed the mechanical rat to attack and intimidate living, breathing rats. It does this to stir depression in the rodents, which in turn allows experts to test antidepressants and other drugs potentially destined for human consumption. Researchers at Tokyo's Waseda University have found that assaulting the rats physically leads them to enter depression quicker than other methods; those include forced swimming and electrocution. But those tactics pale in comparison to the fear and anxiety that the robot rat can cause. The bot operates in three separate modes: ""chase"" commands the robot to closely stalk real-life rats but not attack them directly, Despite the lack of physical contact, this approach still proves successful at inducing fear since the rats are constantly dreading an ambush. When the robot does strike, a ""continuous attack"" sees it constantly running into its target, whereas an ""interactive attack"" mode cuts those torment sessions into five-second intervals. Researchers find that the method proved most successful introducing depression in young rats, with ""interactive"" strikes proving useful as the rodents grew older. But as we mentioned at the outset, the team is hoping to use its findings for the greater good.

Measuring about 164 feet in diameter, the asteroid is expected to approach the Earth at around 2 PM ET today, before reaching its peak brightness at 2:24 PM. It won't be bright enough to see with the naked eye, but as Wired reports, there are several ways to watch the event online. NASA will begin streaming the event at 2 PM ET / 11 AM PT, providing live views from telescopes in Europe and Australia, along with ongoing commentary for several hours afterward. It will also be capturing imagery from California's Goldstone Observatory, in the hopes of gleaning more precise information on its size and shape. Real-time images will also be available from the Bareket Observatory in Israel between 2 PM and 3:30 PM ET, as well as from the Virtual Telescope Project in Italy, beginning at 5 PM ET / 2 PM PT. We've embedded NASA's stream below.     Others will be capturing the asteroid as it moves away from the Earth. The Clay Center Observatory will begin covering the event on its Ustream page from 6 PM to 4 AM ET, while NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center will provide three hours of coverage beginning at 9 PM ET. Slooh, meanwhile, will be covering the event with two live programs. The first begins at 9 PM ET, and the second kicks off at midnight ET. This smorgasbord of streams speaks to how truly unique today's event will be. Experts say the asteroid will be roughly equivalent in size to the rock that caused the Tunguska event in 1908, which unleashed enormous explosions across remote portions of Russia. Fortunately, there's no chance that DA14 will actually strike Earth, though it will cross paths with several geosynchronous satellites orbiting at around 22,200 miles above the surface. The satellites are mostly used for GPS, communication, and meteorology, but according to the Space Data Association, DA14 poses no threat to any of them.

""It's a bit circumstantial, but we have intriguing evidence the W49B supernova also created a black hole,"" MIT astrophysicist Daniel Castro said in a NASA news release Wednesday. That evidence for a black hole is that W49B doesn't contain a neutron star, a tiny ultra-dense ball typically observed at the center of what's left over after a star has gone supernova. If a supernova remnant doesn't have a neutron star, it likely has a black hole at its core instead. ""I feel confident that there's no neutron star and thus there is a black hole,"" MIT astrophysicist Laura Lopez, leader of the study, told The Verge via email. ""I won't say 100 percent confident though because science is never certain!"" In a paper announcing the discovery that's going to be published in the Astrophysical Journal on Sunday, scientists suggest taking a closer look to be sure, using an upcoming Japanese telescope, the Astro-H, due to be launched in 2014. Lopez herself told us she'd be taking another look later this year using the ground-based Magellan Baade Telescopes in Chile and hoped to create a 3D model of the supernova remnant. Whether it has the youngest black hole or not, W49B is unusual. Instead of exploding symmetrically, spreading stellar material evenly in all directions, this supernova ejected material from the poles at much higher speed, which NASA notes resulting in more of a ""barrel-shape"" than in other supernovae.

(Internet Map) This week, new documents from NSA leaker Edward Snowden arrived with some troubling revelations: the NSA has been piggybacking on Google's network, using the company’s ""preferences"" cookie to follow users from site to site, proving their identity before targeting them with malware. It means the agency has tapped into one of the most popular features on the web and the core of Google's multibillion-dollar ad-targeting empire. Instead of just targeting ads and saving preferences, the infrastructure is being used to find people the NSA is interested in and silently infect their devices with malware. ""It solves a bunch of tricky problems for bulk web surveillance."" What's still unclear is whether the NSA is directly hacking Google or using some other way to track these cookies. But while the company is officially keeping quiet, the simple math of cookie tracking makes it likely that the NSA didn't need any help from Google. Tracking cookies offers the NSA the perfect system for following suspects across the web: it's pervasive, persistent, and for the most part, it's still unencrypted. ""It solves a bunch of tricky problems for bulk web surveillance that would otherwise be quite difficult,"" says Jonathan Mayer, a fellow at Stanford's Center for Internet and Society who worked with the Washington Post on the report. The right cookie will follow you as your phone moves from 3G to a coffee shop's Wi-Fi network, and in many cases it'll broadcast your unique ID in plain text. Once the NSA controls cookies, it can use them as a free pass into almost any machine on the web. For the NSA, it's practically made to order. If the agency can suss out a particular person’s unique cookie ID, they can watch for the ID at the cookie-delivery spot (in this case, Google) and get a full record of the person’s movements on the web. The Washington Post doesn’t describe how the agency uses those cookies to deliver malware, but many researchers have already guessed at a likely mechanism. With control of the network, the agency could be able to interject packets in place of a standard cookie, seeding your device with whatever program they want. The result would look like a cookie from Google, but actually be a malware packet disguised as a cookie, tailored to whichever site the agency knows you’re visiting. It’s still just speculation, but it gives a sense of just how powerful the cookie system is for a network-level attacker like the NSA. Once the agency controls cookies, it can use them as a free pass into almost any machine on the web. Identifying information sent over public tubes with no protection It’s hard to guard against these attacks because encryption schemes are uniquely tricky to implement for cookies. As cryptographer Ed Felten points out, regular encryption doesn't work in the case of unique cookie IDs. (The encoded version of a unique ID is a unique ID itself — all you've done is change the number.) The more permanent solution is HTTPS-based encryption, but the more complex handshake slows down load times, which scares away many trackers. The result is a lot of identifying information being sent over public tubes with little to no protection. The problem is that Google is one of the few companies that enables HTTPS on principle, even if that makes the +1 buttons load a little slower. HTTPS is enabled in both Google's DoubleClick ad cookies and service-based preference cookies — including the PREF cookie that's mentioned in the new Snowden documents. If the NSA was going to be following that cookie, unlike most of the cookies floating around the web, the agency needs to negotiate at least a little bit of HTTPS. It’s certainly plausible that they found a way around it. We know from earlier leaks that the NSA has ways of getting around SSL, and it may have followed the Google cookies using similar tricks — but it seems more likely that the agency would have moved on to easier pickings, given the prevalence of unencrypted tracking-cookie networks. Ironically, Google’s good security practices are slightly incriminating here: the more secure its network, the more likely it is that the attackers were working from the inside, whether through legal compulsion or tapping private networks. ""I suspect it's an old slide ... but I'm not certain."" The most likely explanation, favored by UC Berkeley cryptographer Nicholas Weaver, is a little less exciting. ""I suspect it's an old slide, written from back when Google's cooperation wasn't needed,"" Weaver says. ""But I'm not certain about it."" The Washington Post dates the slide to a presentation given in April, 2013, three months after Snowden first made contact with Greenwald, which is well after Google implemented HTTPS for its PREF cookies. Still, it could have been an outdated slide or Snowden could simply have gotten the date of the presentation wrong, although the Post has emphasized that the date was thoroughly vetted before publishing. Still, many are skeptical of Google involvement, including Mayer. ""It doesn't appear the NSA had any particular access to Google infrastructure,"" Mayer says. ""This was based on watching tracking cookies flow across the open web."" Tools like Ghostery will show dozens of cookies following you from site to site The larger problem is figuring out where we go from here. Google’s PREF cookie is a powerful tool, reaching every page with a Google Search bar, Google Map, or +1 button — but it’s hardly the only cookie that could be used this way. Tools like Ghostery will show dozens of cookies following you from site to site, whether it’s for ads, analytics, or universal log-ins like Facebook. Any one of those cookies could be used the same way: to find a single person and drop malware silently into their device. As long as one of them is unencrypted, the NSA will have an unimpeded path through, and while the companies are competing on load times rather than security, they have little incentive to switch. Seen from that vantage, the problem isn’t Google: it’s everyone. ""The quid pro quo of the behavioral advertising ecosystem stinks,"" says ACLU technologist Christopher Soghoian. ""Our web browsers and mobile operating systems have been designed with defaults that facilitate tracking of our activities. It’s only natural that the NSA would try to harness it."" The web runs on tracking. It powers our analytics, our ads, and personalized services from Facebook to Netflix. It’s not clear what unwinding that system would even mean. Universal HTTPS would be a start (some have already proposed it), but the deeper problem is a web that’s built for speed rather than security. Most ad networks have never even considered how to guard against a network-level attacker like the NSA. Hardening those networks would be a massive undertaking, requiring new security at every level and no small amount of performance tradeoffs. Even now, after the Snowden has proved how real the threat is, it may not be a leap they’re willing to take.",0.607327525574398,0.39267247442560205,0.1661785954261175,1182,5.0355329949238579,575,6.2939130434782609,0,0,"US & World, National Security, Report",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

Just as you catch your bearings, you look up to see the bright lights of an oncoming N train. This scenario isn't far-fetched. About a year ago, the New York Post ran a grisly photo of a man with his arms over the side of the platform with an oncoming Q train train 20 feet away, the photographer's flash catching the whites of the terrified conductor's eyes. ""Pushed on the subway track, this man is about to die,"" read the headline. And he did.  ""Pushed on the subway track, this man is about to die.""  This year was a bad one for subway deaths. On average, 134 people have been hit by subways and 49 killed every year since 2001, according to the MTA. This year, 144 people were hit and 52 died, and we still have two more weeks to get through. Now the city is hoping to bring those numbers down using new technology. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) is testing motion sensor lasers, thermal imaging, intelligent video software, and radio frequencies to determine the best method of detecting when a person falls onto the subway tracks. The lasers would beam across the tracks, Mission Impossible-style. When the beams are interrupted by a body, it triggers an alarm that will stop oncoming trains. The radio frequencies would work similarly. Thermal imaging would detect body heat on the tracks, and the smart video software installed in the closed-circuit cameras would recognize when a large object moves from the platform to the tracks. The testing will take place at an undisclosed station sometime in the next few weeks, but as Mashable notes, the MTA can't exactly afford to implement such a high-tech program widely. And considering 1.6 billion people ride the subway every year, the death rate is really quite low. Of course, that doesn't mean much if you're one of the unlucky victims.

The panel, formed earlier this year, isn't due to present a report to the White House until December 15th, but according to people who have reviewed the documents, it's taking aim at one of the most high-profile issues: the mass collection of phone metadata allowed under the FISA Amendments Act and Patriot Act. Under the suggested rules, the NSA would have to meet a higher burden of proof before collecting records — instead of being held in a government database, they would stay in the hands of the phone companies or other third parties. That doesn't necessarily mean the NSA will be querying less data, since it can simply ask phone companies to provide information about the numbers. It also isn't clear whether the panel is planning reform of how the agency collects internet metadata records, emails, location data, or anything else captured by its substantial online surveillance system. But it will take the phone records of millions of Americans not suspected of any terrorist activity out of the intelligence community's hands. A pair of bills from Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT) and Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner (R-WI) already propose to end bulk phone-record collection by rewriting the rule that allows it, requiring records to be both relevant to a national security investigation and related to a foreign power or a suspected American agent of that power. The Journal's sources have said that the panel's suggestion ""aligns very closely"" with the bills. The NSA has defended its database by warning that investigations could be hampered by the delay of asking phone companies for records. The head of the NSA would no longer lead US Cyber Command More proposals would silo individual intelligence operations. The panel has apparently recommended splitting off the Information Assurance Directorate, the segment of the NSA responsible for developing and testing security systems. Since leaks have revealed extensive NSA efforts to crack and weaken encryption protocols in other departments, the proposal is aimed at reducing the conflict of interest between the two projects and showing that the directorate is operating in good faith, not as part of a larger code-cracking effort. Likewise, the panel has reportedly taken a side in the ongoing debate over whether the head of the NSA should also be the head of US Cyber Command. Both positions are currently held by Keith Alexander, but under these recommendations, his successor at the NSA would be a civilian and command of the military's cyberwarfare units would be placed elsewhere as a check on the NSA's power. This change may already have been in the cards, but the panel's support of it could bolster sympathy. Overall, it's too early to assume that these suggestions will be taken up, but they echo promises made by President Obama in August, as well as proposals from Congress and the public.

All are being wrapped into the CTIA's consumer code of conduct, which means other companies will have to adopt them within the next 12 months, if approved. Plan standardizes unlock policies between carriers The new rules require carriers to provide clear disclosure on unlocking policies for phone and tablet owners who sign up for multi-year plans, as well as with prepaid devices, which can be unlocked after a year. Carriers also need to provide notice to customers who are eligible for an unlocking, and proceed to unlock the device within two days from the time of any request. Lastly, the agreement calls for a blanket policy on unlocking phones to any deployed military personnel, as long as they show papers. The agreement, which has been presented to the Federal Communications Commission, is a direct response to a petition on the Library of Congress's decision not to renew language within the DMCA that legalized unlocking, as well as last month's ultimatum from new FCC chairman Tom Wheeler to strike such a deal. The new plan does not spell out what happens to those who attempt to unlock a device before a contract period is up, though it makes it more clear and consistent for what the unlocking processes are, and the timelines for each type of customer.

Since launching last year, Aereo has been seen as a thorn in the side of broadcasters: it offers consumers an option to stream broadcast TV online through a personal stream, something that traditional broadcasters have argued infringes on their content rights. Aereo has been to court several times and in several different markets to address the matter, and it's largely come out the winner so far.  ""We want this resolved on the merits rather than through a wasteful war of attrition."" But over the last several months, a group of broadcasters has begun escalating the matter by petitioning the Supreme Court to hear a case against Aereo. According to Deadline, the group includes Disney, Fox, NBCUniversal, CBS, and Univision — among others — and it seems that they're interested in quickly finding out whether Aereo is legal or not, regardless of the conclusion. Stopping the service soon might maintain the status quo, while finding out that Aereo is legal could potentially prompt broadcasters to address it competitively. Aereo similarly appears eager to get these lawsuits over with. ""Broadcasters appear determined to keep litigating the same issues against Aereo in every jurisdiction that we enter,"" Kanojia says.

Tom's going to surprise some people and they'll want to reward that. I don't think we'd have to recast Woz. Seth's the right age in the first act and Tom's the right age in the third. And the movie announces itself pretty quickly as not being literal--as being a painting rather than a photograph. Look, I wouldn't cast Clint Eastwood but if I saw Tom Cruise flying around the backstage corridors of Symphony Hall I wouldn't think he was too old. I think it would be dazzling performance. Director Danny Boyle decided to go with Michael Fassbender, however, and the studio couldn't drum up enough financing to support the decision, allowing for the movie to move to Universal. Sorkin reportedly said, ""Fuck it. He's a great actor whose time has come,"" when the studio moved forward on the decision. The leaked details come as Sony Pictures is currently dealing with a massive hack on it servers. Hackers breached corporate computers in the week before Thanksgiving, and more break-ins have been made to prevent the studio from releasing The Interview, starring James Franco and Seth Rogen.

And the carrier won't be able to use the FCC's new net neutrality rules to escape it. Last year, the FTC sued AT&T, accusing the carrier of deceiving its customers and badly mishandling the move away from all-you-can-eat data. When the company did away with unlimited plans a few years ago, it promised that existing subscribers would be able to hold onto them. So far, that's been true; but AT&T also began throttling data speeds for users who tax its network most heavily, something the FTC hasn't been a fan of. AT&T insists it's never deceived anyone AT&T maintains it's been up front about the changes, alerting customers to its throttling policies (which take effect once your LTE smartphone passes 5GB in a given month) via email notifications and explanations posted on its website. But the FTC still thinks the carrier can do more — like making the slowdowns clearer when subscribers renew their contract, for example. Even AT&T plainly says that it may not always offer text message warnings every time you approach the limit. ""The next time you exceed that usage level, your speeds may be reduced without another text message reminder,"" the carrier's website says. Lesson to mobile companies from FTC’s 1st data throttling case: If u promise unlimited data, ur on hook to deliver: http://t.co/Q29FL8Am2V  Obviously the two sides disagree about what qualifies as deception, but AT&T took an interesting route in trying to fend off the case: it recently argued that the FCC's new net neutrality framework will place it (and other mobile carriers) outside the FTC's jurisdiction — even for past conduct. Since mobile networks will soon be seen as common carrier utilities, the carrier claimed that Tom Wheeler has essentially placed AT&T, Verizon, Sprint, and other companies completely outside the FTC's purview. Not so fast, ruled a California federal judge on Tuesday. Unlimited data isn't suddenly coming back ""When this suit was filed, AT&T’s mobile data service was not regulated as common carrier activity by the Federal Communications Commission,"" the court filing reads. ""Once the Reclassification Order of the Federal Communications Commission (which now treats mobile data serve as common carrier activity) goes into effect, that will not deprive the FTC of any jurisdiction over past alleged misconduct as asserted in this pending action."" So it's game on for the lawsuit, but don't expect unlimited data to be resurrected from the dead for AT&T's more recent customers. That was never going to happen. Again, this is more about the FTC slapping AT&T on the wrist for botching the transition. Impacted customers may one day see a settlement, but they'll always need to keep watching their data usage. AT&T has already said it plans to quickly appeal Tuesday's decision.",0.32004346976835496,0.679956530231645,0.5858593708288778,480,5.1229166666666668,301,5.8039867109634553,1,0,"Mobile, Tech",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

That's especially true in developing countries where ""the internet"" is practically indistinguishable from Facebook's mobile app, but according to new data from the Pew Research Center, it's also true of adults in the United States — as many as one-fifth of them. Pew's survey, conducted in October of 2014, asked adults if they didn't have high-speed internet service at home and if they didn't have many options other than their phones for getting online. Nineteen percent of respondents said they met at least one of those conditions, and 7 percent said they both lack broadband internet access and have limited options for getting online outside of their smartphone. That's a big deal when you consider how much of a pain it can be to get anything done over a mobile connection sometimes; 49 percent of respondents said content they tried to view on their phone doesn't display properly at least occasionally, 36 percent said they hit their data caps, and 47 percent reported that bad connections at least occasionally prevent them from using their phones. The mobile broadband situation is racially and economically biased As we've pointed out before, the mobile broadband situation in the US is racially and economically biased: if you're young, poor, or non-white, you're more likely to rely on your smartphone for internet access. Pew's latest study found that 15 percent of Americans between ages 18–29 are ""heavily dependent"" on a smartphone for internet access, that 13 percent of Americans whose households bring in less than $30,000 per year depend on smartphones (compared to just 1 percent of those from households earning more than $75,000 a year), and that only 4 percent of whites depend on their smartphones to get online, compared to 12 percent of African-Americans and 13 percent of Latinos. With Americans increasingly using smartphones as their primary gateway to the internet, the rules that govern mobile broadband will only become more important.

Under this approach, broadcasters would foot costs for the serious infrastructure needed on the back end of Apple's unannounced service, with Cupertino putting its focus on the hardware and software (user experience) side of things. Apple has yet to reveal the new product, but Recode says the company is hoping to launch by next fall. Eddie Cue is handling negotiations with potential TV partners, and a previous report said the company is aiming to start off with around 25 channels — on par with Dish's Sling service. TV partners are hesitant to sign on As Recode points out, this isn't radically different from the ""channels"" on Apple TV today; rather than have Apple handle everything, most major networks push their own streams to the set-top box. But a true internet TV service (with 24/7 live, linear broadcasts) is obviously grander in scope than what Apple has on the market right now, and executives have apparently been hesitant about going along with Apple's vision. In particular, it's been rumored that Apple and Comcast have had a falling out of sorts during negotiations. Apple's not alone in going with the ""stick to what you know"" approach. For its standalone subscription service, HBO Now, HBO recruited the help of MLB Advanced Media, which handles all the heavy lifting. MLB's technology division also powers WWE Network, the 24/7 pro wrestling service. Apple could also be pursuing this path so that whenever its service does finally launch, internet service providers like Comcast won't easily be able to target it or slow down streaming speeds. Doing so could cause problems for the videos that Fox, ABC, and others serve to internet users elsewhere. But nothing's going to happen until Apple can line up solid content deals. Sling TV has ESPN, Disney, and soon HBO; PlayStation Vue has its own large catalog of live programming.

Unlike Windows, Chrome OS isn't exactly designed with touch in mind — but that's slowly starting to change. Google announced a touchscreen Chromebook from Asus that can be used in tablet mode yesterday, and alongside it will be a few tweaks to Chrome OS that'll make it a bit more touch-friendly. When you consider the fact that Android apps will soon be coming to Chrome OS as well, those touchscreens make a lot more sense than they did a year ago.

Now, a team of American and European researchers have shed new light on the incident, lending extra weight to an already widely-adopted theory. Researchers have spent years trying to find a direct connection between the Cretaceous-Tertiary extinction event (K-T, for short) and cosmic collision. They found a lead in the late 1970s, when geophysicist Glen Penfield discovered a giant prehistoric crater near the town of Chicxulub in Mexico. At more than 110 miles wide, the crater provided evidence of an utterly massive impact — one that would have released an explosion one billion times stronger than the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki during World War II. The only problem, however, was figuring out whether this asteroid's collision actually coincided with the extinction of the dinosaurs. Tsunamis, dust clouds, and firestorms Previous studies have estimated that the Chicxulub asteroid struck some 300,000 years before the dinosaurs' demise, leading some to suspect alternative causes for their extinction. But a study published this week shows that the two events happened no more than 33,000 years apart — a small margin when considering time on such a large scale. Researchers arrived at their findings after conducting high-precision radiometric dating of debris near Chicxulub, providing strong evidence that the dinosaurs died off as a direct result of the asteroid's impact.   ""We've shown the impact and the mass extinction coincided as much as one can possibly demonstrate with existing dating techniques,"" Paul Renne, study co-author and director of the Berkeley Geochronology Center, told LiveScience. The asteroid in question is believed to have been six miles wide, and its impacts were likely devastating, blocking out the sun with a thick cloud of dust, unleashing mega-tsunamis across the world, and possibly igniting massive firestorms. The collision alone is believed to have wiped out 75 percent of life on Earth.   Renne was quick to note, however, that the dinosaurs' extinction can't be attributed to the cosmos, alone. Earth's climate was already reaching a tipping point before the asteroid ever hit, leading to long cold snaps and volcanic eruptions. ""The impact was clearly the final straw that pushed Earth past the tipping point,"" Renne said. ""We have shown that these events are synchronous to within a gnat's eyebrow, and therefore, the impact clearly played a major role in extinctions, but it probably wasn't just the impact.""",0.5085443712399076,0.4914556287600924,0.8232656864018648,421,5.3087885985748215,261,6.245210727969349,0,0,Science,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The Global Wind Energy Council says that China, the USA, and other countries added significant wind capacity last year, bringing the total up roughly 20 percent from where it was in 2011 to about 282 gigawatts. The growth in US wind farms was, in part, spurred by tax credits; though the credit was renewed for 2013, construction isn't likely to continue at this pace. Europe, meanwhile, has the highest total level of wind energy, with Germany and Spain making up a significant portion and the UK leading in offshore wind farms. Though solar produces barely a third as much energy as wind power, it grew more rapidly. The European Photovoltaic Industry Association has tentatively reported that global solar energy capacity passed 100 GW for the first time after seeing 30 GW added in 2012. Much of that is concentrated in Europe, particularly Germany and France, but the EPIA said countries like China were also becoming more significant markets: growth actually slowed in Europe and increased in the rest of the world. Overall, there was barely 40 GW of solar power worldwide at the end of 2010, meaning it's more than doubled in two years. Solar power is far less widespread than wind, but it doubled in two years It's important to note that despite this growth, both wind and solar make up a relatively small percentage of overall energy. Wind power in the US, for example, is about six percent of our total output. And despite attempts to scale it down, coal energy remains a juggernaut. In 2011, the US Energy Information Administration reported a capacity of 318 GW from coal in the US, and it estimated that China — the world's largest user of coal — had over 650 GW of capacity that same year. Overall, global coal-fired capacity was said to be around 1,600 GW, dwarfing wind and solar put together. And while countries like China have been leading proponents of renewable energy (including other methods like hydropower), growing power requirements often lead to an increase in fossil fuel use as well.",0.6131648138232044,0.3868351861767956,0.2454005074036655,354,4.8785310734463279,207,5.6570048309178746,0,0,Science,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

As part of Coke's ad campaign, it allowed people to reply to tweets with the hashtag #MakeItHappy, which would prompt the @CocaCola account to automatically take that tweet and spit it back out as fun ASCII art.

The interpreter, Thamsanqa Jantjie, told Johannesburg's Star newspaper today that he started hallucinating and hearing voices on stage, causing him to mime in ways that deaf viewers and sign language experts described as incomprehensible. ""There was nothing I could do. I was alone in a very dangerous situation,"" Jantjie said. ""I tried to control myself and not show the world what was going on. I am very sorry. It's the situation I found myself in."" ""We are not sure if there is any truth in what has been said."" Bruno Druchen, the director of the South Africa's Deaf Federation, earlier this week told the Associated Press that Jantjie was ""literally flapping his arms around"" on stage, as he interpreted speeches delivered by President Barack Obama, South African President Jacob Zuma, and other world leaders. Other sign language experts said the man could not even interpret basic words like ""thank you"" and ""Mandela."" In the interview with Star, Jantjie said he takes medication to treat his schizophrenia, though he could not explain what triggered the episode this week. Schizophrenia is a severe mental illness that can cause hallucinations, paranoia, and delusions. An estimated 24 million people suffer from the disorder worldwide, according to the World Health Organization. ""Anyone who doesn't understand this illness will think that I’m just making this up."" ""Life is unfair. This illness is unfair,"" Jantjie added. ""Anyone who doesn't understand this illness will think that I’m just making this up."" The interpreter also said that he worked for a company called SA Interpreters, which was hired by South Africa's governing African National Congress (ANC), though Reuters was unsuccessful in its attempts to track down the company. Hendrietta Bogopane-Zulu, deputy cabinet minister, acknowledged to the Associated Press today that ""a mistake happened"" in hiring Jantjie, adding that an investigation is underway. Officials have sought to track down the company that employs the interpreter, but its owners ""have vanished into thin air,"" she added. The ANC told Reuters that it was unaware of the matter, though South Africa's Deaf Federation had raised concerns about Jantjie's abilities prior to this week's memorial. In an interview this week with South Africa's City Press, federation vice chair Wilma Newhoudt-Druchen confirmed that the organization filed a complaint with the ANC as early as mid-2012, after Jantjie interpreted a speech delivered by President Zuma. According to Newhoudt-Druchen, the federation never received a response. In an interview with the Associated Press, Jantjie claimed he was once hospitalized at a mental institution for more than a year, and admitted to having violent outbursts in the past, though he declined to elaborate. The revelation has raised security concerns for Obama and other world leaders, many of whom stood just yards away from Jantjie at Tuesday's ceremony.

""We respectfully request that you no longer perform transactions with this company or other companies of this kind,"" the letter says. ""If there should be a reoccurrence of this type of activity, we will regretfully be forced to close your account."" Bitcoin is not illegal. It’s been praised for its many legal uses by the people in the FBI, Treasury Department, and Congress. Investors have plunged millions into startups providing Bitcoin services. So why would Firstrust be worried about one of its customers using a Bitcoin wallet? In fact, banks around the country from MasterCard to the Internet Credit Union are still wary of the virtual currency. Even Bank of America’s analysts, who believe Bitcoin could become a ""major means of payment,"" are worried about a crackdown. That's because many Bitcoin companies that should be registered with the federal government or state money transmitter authorities, aren't. And because of legal ambiguities, many banks would rather be safe than sorry. Banks are still wary of the virtual currency In the US, the virtual currency is subject to money transmitter laws at the federal level and in 47 states. The rules are not always clear, however, because they are written for money transmission services, not virtual currencies. The regulations are also in flux. New York is considering a special ""BitLicense"" for virtual currency firms, for example. As a result, many Bitcoin companies have not registered at either the state or federal level. Only 35 Bitcoin companies have registered with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), the bureau of the US Treasury Department that has taken the lead on Bitcoin regulation, and the agency has reached out to several dozen more that it believes need to register. At the state level, regulators are getting many inquiries but not many registrations, according to the commissioner of banks in Massachusetts. ""There are plenty of companies for whom the regulatory burdens are just too onerous to get licensed, and plenty of companies out there simply not getting licenses,"" says Marco Santori, who monitors regulatory affairs for the nonprofit Bitcoin Foundation, the currency’s semi-official trade organization. ""It's a risk-tolerance decision for them."" ""There are ... plenty of companies out there simply not getting licenses."" FinCEN issued guidance back in March that defines the types of Bitcoin businesses that must register as money transmitters with the federal government. On top of that federal requirement, 47 states require businesses that transmit Bitcoin to get licensed as money transmitters. The exceptions are Montana, New Mexico, and South Carolina, but Bitcoin businesses can’t simply move there — they must be registered in every state in which they do business. Bitcoin companies are starting to feel the weight of these rules. The federal registration requires companies to maintain due diligence on their customers, assign a compliance officer, and a few other things that take a few hours a week and are basically free says Charlie Shrem, founder of BitInstant, a company that speeds up Bitcoin transfers. ""State law is where it gets sticky,"" he says. Becoming compliant in the whole country costs between $5 million and $10 million and takes a year, he estimates. ""Operating a money transmission company is a criminal offense without a license, therefore jail time,"" he says. ""It's only recently where Bitcoin companies are starting to realize they can't fly under the radar anymore."" Enforcement of anti-money laundering laws against Bitcoin companies is unheard of   Shrem and others, especially the new crop of venture-backed Bitcoin startups, have invested the time and money into compliance. Well-known companies such as BitInstant, Coinbase, and the Tokyo-based exchange Mt. Gox are all registered with FinCEN, for example. ItBit, a Bitcoin-trading platform based in Singapore, hopes to get licensed in the US sometime next year. ""We find that it's so valuable that we're willing to make that investment,"" says CEO Richmond Teo. So far, enforcement of anti-money laundering laws against Bitcoin companies is unheard of.

Every day, the NSA records the lives of millions of Americans and countless foreigners, collecting staggering amounts of information about who they know, where they've been, and what they've done. Its surveillance programs have been kept secret from the public they allegedly serve and protect. The agency operates the most sophisticated, effective, and secretive surveillance apparatus in history. Recent disclosures about the intelligence gathering activities of the NSA, and the ensuing federal response, have demonstrated that the agency is a rogue state — unaccountable and out of control. Intelligence community leaders have openly lied to elected officials and the public about the nature and extent of the agency’s data collection efforts. And despite their responsibility in carefully overseeing intelligence agencies, President Obama and Congress have shown no credibility as custodians of the NSA. So far, Congress has shown far less tolerance for baseball players allegedly lying about personal steroid use than military leaders lying about surveillance programs that undermine the bill of rights. Congress has shown it cares more about baseball players lying about steroids than the NSA lying about spying After more than a decade of legal adventurism, secret presidential orders, and deceptive wordplay, policymakers and intelligence officials have erected a surveillance apparatus that can track the location of hundreds of millions of people, collect the phone records of the entire nation, and tap into the very backbone of the internet. Every day, the NSA collects millions of electronic records belonging to people who are not suspected of any wrongdoing. It may even know what you’re up to in World of Warcraft, because the bad guys are apparently slaying dragons while they plot terror attacks. The secret court responsible for overseeing the NSA’s activities is required to, on a yearly basis, approve only general guidelines on how the government intends to collect intelligence on foreigners. The NSA is not supposed to spy on American citizens, but it ""incidentally"" collects vast amounts of data on them anyway. Intelligence Community director James Clapper and others have defended these practices by contorting words like ""collection"" and ""surveillance"" in ways that make Bill Clinton’s 1998 soliloquy on the meaning of the word ""is"" look like amateur bullshitting. In 2005, then-Senator Obama opposed changes to the Patriot Act that would have allowed what he called ""government fishing expeditions targeting innocent Americans."" Obama said the government needed ""to show the American people that the federal government will only issue warrants and execute searches because it needs to, not because it can."" As president, Obama has not only extended Bush-era programs, but expanded the NSA’s ability to conduct indiscriminate, warrantless surveillance. Despite his endorsement of NSA bulk surveillance, President Obama may not even know everything the agency is up to; the White House and the NSA can’t even agree about whether the president knew the agency was tapping German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s phone. Obama allegedly spent five years in office without knowing his military was eavesdropping on world leaders. Congress has operated with similar blinders despite its permissive attitude on bulk spying, though now it complains that the NSA hasn't shared enough in its annual show-and-tell sessions. In the face of this ignorance, several Congressional leaders now want to retroactively authorize the NSA’s mass spying programs rather than audit them. An irrational fear of terrorism still plagues US policy Of course, none of the NSA’s surveillance programs, irrational ""homeland security"" policies, or limitless wars started in the past decade would be possible without the nagging specter of terrorism. In the years following 9/11, President Bush, President Obama, and Congressional leaders have obsequiously accepted dubious claims about the threat of terrorism, eroding the Fourth and Fifth Amendments in the expanding intelligence bureaucracy’s wake. Even calls to rein in the NSA from the most reform-minded members of Congress are framed by the specious idea that terrorism is the nation’s supreme hazard. ""Our first priority is to keep Americans safe from the threat of terrorism,"" Senator Ron Wyden wrote in a November op-ed. Nevermind the fact that Americans are roughly four times more likely to be killed by lightning than by a terrorist. You would think the National Weather Service might be able to get a larger piece of the federal pie, or at least a color-coded thunderstorm advisory system. Instead, we have airport pat downs and PRISM. Do we need to be afraid of the NSA, as one might be afraid of a boot stamping on a human face, forever? Probably not. But the erosion of American civil liberties won’t appear out of thin air as an Orwellian caricature of totalitarianism. It looks more like a computer server silently blinking in a Utah data center, as it reconstructs the connective tissue of your entire life: a thorough diagram of your existence that can be recalled at any time by someone with the right permission level and the right query. Who’ll be behind the machines in four years? How about in 20? Who will our enemies be then? This is not the kind of American exceptionalism we want The NSA, like the totalitarian spy agencies of the past, believes it is entitled to all the world’s knowledge. Directly following 9/11, the Bush administration began a data-mining program called ""Total Information Awareness,"" and the NSA has stated publicly that it intends to ""live on the network."" That arrogance belies an underlying naivety about our true ability to prevent violence, which at some point no amount of secret billions in the spy budget will change. And aggressive behavior — like tapping the phones of world leaders and spying on hundreds of millions of foreign nationals — has negative consequences for us, whatever our intentions are. While some legitimate foreign surveillance is necessary, the NSA's unlimited ambitions, which includes efforts to undermine the encryption standards we rely on for basic privacy, undermines overall trust in the internet for everyone. American exceptionalism cannot justify making our friends insecure; it ought to demand the opposite. In an 1822 letter to Kentucky Lt. Governor W.T. Barry, James Madison wrote that ""a popular Government, without popular information, or the means of acquiring it, is but a prologue to a farce or a tragedy; or perhaps both."" Madison’s letter, originally espousing a robust public education system for Kentucky, has since been used as an appeal for open government. ""A people who mean to be their own governors,"" Madison wrote, ""must arm themselves with the power which knowledge gives."" Today, the people appear utterly unarmed against the National Security Agency, which holds a incredible amount of knowledge about citizens while withholding essential facts about how it spies on them. That secret knowledge is secret power, which is anathema to democracy when in the hands of an unaccountable elite. During colonial rule, ""general warrants"" from the British crown threatened the safe spaces of American social life by allowing the King’s agents to search anyone, anywhere, at any time, regardless of whether they were suspected of a crime. Today, many of those spaces are on the internet — a place we can no longer trust to be secure from our own military, which considers many parts of your electronic life beyond the protections of the Bill of Rights. Only by ending the bulk surveillance of American citizens immediately, and by rebuilding the federal oversight intended to keep the NSA from violating the law, can trust in our democracy be restored.",0.627604850295624,0.37239514970437604,0.8431640497847358,1252,5.369808306709265,654,6.692660550458716,0,0,"Culture, Tech, US & World, Editorial",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

Snowden stepped forward in June as the whistleblower behind the Guardian and Washington Post's blistering reports detailing the NSA's PRISM and Boundless Informant programs. Since then, he has taken temporary asylum in Moscow as new documents continue to reveal the depth of the intelligence community's surveillance tactics — all at a near daily clip. At a meeting with supporters in October, Time reports, Snowden reiterated his reasons for the leaks: ""There is a far cry between legal programs, legitimate spying, legitimate law enforcement ... and the sort of dragnet mass surveillance that puts entire populations under a sort of an eye and sees everything, even when it is not needed."" For him, President Obama should take the opportunity to make sweeping reforms to these programs, directing the NSA's power at creating new technological standards for surveillance.

Congressional leaders have also called for reform on the issue. However, as Snowden told Time, the next necessary step on the part of the citizenry is to better use encryption. Here, technology can be used to solve a vast political problem. ""In general,"" he told Time in an email, ""if you agree with the First Amendment principles, you agree with encryption.

Called Saga, it has everything you'd expect from a good space opera, including plenty of sex and lots of violence. But there are also spaceships that grow like trees, aliens with analog televisions for heads, and a talking cat that knows when you're lying. It's Star Wars on LSD, and it's amazing. Science fiction has seen a resurgence of late thanks in large part to Hollywood. Some of the top-grossing movies from the last two years include a story about an astronaut trapped in space and a mind-bending tale about wormholes, not to mention the best Marvel movie in years. And games are making the shift too, with huge, heralded new franchises like Titanfall and Destiny both launching this year. Even the classic Civilization has moved into space. These experiences can be awe-inspiring, thanks to ridiculously expensive special effects that give us a glimpse of what the future could look like. But the same thing that makes these movies and games so great can also hold them back: when it costs millions of dollars to make something, companies want to minimize the risk. And often that means playing it safe.   Saga It's the reason why Destiny's fascinating and beautiful world was wrapped around a repetitive and often dull game. It's also why comic book sci-fi continues to be so great: without the restraints of a budget or technology, creators are free to create whatever they like. (Sci-fi novels can be great too, but they don't have that same visual punch that comes from seeing a really well-designed spaceship or cool-looking alien species.) Saga, created by writer Brian K. Vaughan and artist Fiona Staples, is perhaps the best example of this. While its basic structure is what you'd expect from an epic sci-fi tale, it's also one of the weirdest things you'll ever read. The more conventional set-up, which is essentially Romeo and Juliet in space, lets the series get away with some of its crazier elements. The main characters are pretty normal people, except for the fact that some have ram-like horns and others are horribly mutilated apparitions. And Vaughan, who has also worked as a writer in both film and television, seems to revel in the fact that he can do whatever he pleases with Saga. ""If anything, I started writing the series out of frustration with what I couldn't do in any other media,"" he says. ""I started writing the series out of frustration with what I couldn't do in any other media."" Saga is far from the only example. Another Vaughan series, The Private Eye created with artist Marco Martin, envisions a strange future where the internet doesn't exist, yet people are even more obsessed with privacy than they are now. Trees, from Warren Ellis and Jason Howard, takes place on a future version of Earth where unexplained, towering alien artifacts have appeared all over the world. These structures do nothing (at least so far), yet their effect on the population is immense. Meanwhile, the newly launched ODY-C from Matt Fraction and Christian Ward is a psychedelic, space opera take on the story of Odysseus, with art that looks ripped from a 1970s album cover. ""It just gets crazier from here,"" the creators promise at the end of the first issue. Those are just a few examples, and they're all very different. They're also able to tackle elements of their stories in ways that movies or games just can't, whether it's due to budgets, audience, or technology. In ODY-C, for instance, there's a spaceship where the cockpit resembles a giant pink womb. The Vertigo series FBP takes place in a world where the laws of physics change and shift just like the weather. And in Universe, a brand new series from Spanish writer and artist Albert Monteys, a corporation travels back in time so that it can trademark the building blocks of life. Imagine the special effects budget you'd need to pull some of that stuff off. Video games are getting closer, as something like the ambitious No Man's Sky can be built by a handful of people, but in comics all you need is one talented artist to pull it off.   ODY-C And it's more than just the technology and science. While a director as big as Ridley Scott claims his biblical epic Exodus could only be made if it starred famous white actors, these comics feature characters from basically every race, gender, and background — and they're in important roles, not just in the background. Trees has several prominent trans characters, and the most badass fighters in Saga are moms. In ODY-C, all of the characters have literally been gender-swapped, so that all of the important people from Odysseus' life are now women. In the most recent issue of The Woods, a great series about a bunch of high school students mysteriously transported to an alien planet, a gay black kid is on the cover. Creative freedom leads to some amazing sci-fi What ties many of these books together is that few of them are published by Marvel or DC, the two big companies in comics (the exception being Vertigo, a DC offshoot that specializes in crazier fare like FBP). Some are self-published online, others come from smaller companies, but the vast majority come from Image Comics. Image's most important characteristic is that each series is owned by its creators, not the publisher. This has led to breakout hits like Spawn and The Walking Dead, and it turns out that creative freedom leads to some amazing sci-fi. Saga is the biggest name, winning the Eisner awards for Best Writer and Best Continuing Series in both 2013 and 2014, but new series like ODY-C and the upcoming Bitch Planet have generated plenty of interest. Whereas big-budget productions usually need to worry about what will work with an audience, a creator-owned comic is free to try brand new things. ""If you're curious what kinds of sci-fi movies and shows Hollywood will be making in 10 or 15 years,"" says Vaughan, ""I'd look at what Image is publishing today.""",0.7363088675705391,0.26369113242946085,0.15706392946297407,1042,4.8051823416506716,550,6.0072727272727269,0,4,"Culture, Entertainment, Essay",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Prince's  In an age where fans expect direct relationships with the artists they love, Prince has turned himself into a reclusive legend. But 30 years ago, he was still a young artist on the cusp of releasing his greatest record — and former Vibe and Spin editor-in-chief Alan Light's Let's Go Crazy: Prince and the Making of Purple Rain documents how the record and film came to be. This is an exclusive excerpt from the first chapter of the book, which goes on sale today. The stage is dark. A chord rings out. It’s an unusual chord — a B flat suspended 2 with a D in the bass. A year from this night, the sound of that chord will be enough to drive audiences into hysteria. But right now, in this club, the crowd of 1,500 or so people listen quietly, because it’s the first time they are hearing the song that the chord introduces. A spotlight comes up, revealing a young woman playing a purple guitar. She is dressed simply, in a white V-neck tank top, patterned mini-skirt, and white, metal-studded, purple-trimmed high-top sneakers. Her asymmetrical haircut is very much on trend for 1983, the year this show is taking place. Wendy Melvoin, the girl holding the guitar, is just 19 years old, and this is not only the first time she is performing this song in public, it is also her first appearance as the new guitarist in Prince’s band, the Revolution. So far tonight, they have played nine songs; this one is kicking off the encore. She plays through a chord progression once, and the rest of the five-piece band falls in behind her. They go through the cycle again, and then again. The fifth time around, you can hear a second guitar coming from somewhere off-stage. On the ninth instrumental go-round, Prince strides out, wrapped tightly in a purple trench coat. He plays a few fills, moves his head to the microphone as if he’s about to start singing, then pulls back again. Finally, three-and-a-half minutes into the song, he begins his vocal, reciting more than singing the first line—""I never meant to cause you any sorrow…"" It’s a performance that would soon become his signature recording and one of popular music’s greatest landmarks. When he reaches the chorus, repeating the phrase ""purple rain"" six times, the crowd does not sing along. They have no idea how familiar those two words will soon become, and what impact they will turn out to have for the 25-year-old man on stage in front of them. But it’s almost surreal to listen to this performance now, because while this 13-minute version of ""Purple Rain"" will later be edited, with some subtle overdubs and effects added, this very recording—the maiden voyage of the song—is clearly recognizable as the actual ""Purple Rain,"" in the final form that will be burned into a generation’s brain, from the vocal asides to the blistering, high-speed guitar solo to the final, shimmering piano coda. As the performance winds down, Prince says quietly to the audience, ""We love you very, very much."" In the audience, up in the club’s balcony, Albert Magnoli listens to Prince and the Revolution play the song. Magnoli, a recent graduate of the University of Southern California’s film school, has just arrived in Minneapolis to begin work on Prince’s next project, a feature film based on the musician’s life which will start shooting in a few months. He thinks that this grand, epic ballad might provide the climactic, anthemic moment for the movie, an element which he hadn’t yet found in the batch of new recordings and work tapes Prince had given him. After the set, Magnoli joins the singer backstage and asks about the song. ""‘You mean ‘Purple Rain?’"" Prince says. ""It’s really not done yet."" Magnoli tells him that he thinks this might be the key song they are missing for the film. Prince, the director recalls, considers that for a minute, and then says, ""If that’s the song, can Purple Rain also be the title of the movie?"" This launch and christening of Purple Rain occurred on August 3, 1983, at the First Avenue Club in downtown Minneapolis. The show—with tickets priced at $25—was a benefit for the Minneapolis Dance Theatre, where Prince has already started his band taking lessons in movement and rehearsing in preparation for the film. The sold-out show, which raised $23,000 for the company, was his first appearance in his hometown since his triumphant 1999 tour ended in April, during the course of which he reached the Top Ten on the album and singles charts for the first time, and made the hard-fought leap to becoming an A-List pop star. The event was significant enough that Rolling Stone covered the show in its ""Random Notes"" section. Noting that ""the mini-skirted Wendy"" had replaced guitarist Dez Dickerson, the item said that Prince and the band ""swung into a 10-song (actually 11) act, including new tracks entitled ‘Computer Blue,’ ‘Let’s Get Crazy,’ (sic) ‘I Will Die For U,’ (sic) ‘Electric Intercourse,’ and a cover of Joni Mitchell’s ‘A Case of You.’ Then he encored with an anthemic — and long — new one called ‘Purple Rain.’…Prince looked toned up from workouts with Minneapolis choreographer John Command, who’s plotting the dance numbers for the film Prince has dreamed up. The new songs, which may appear on Prince’s next LP, are to be part of the movie’s soundtrack…filming is slated to start November 1st."" For the members of the Revolution, the fact that the show was being recorded wasn’t such a big deal. ""I wasn’t really aware that Bobby’s brother had been brought on board to engineer what was coming into the live truck,"" says keyboard player Matt Fink. ""When they told me that, I thought, ‘Oh, he’s recording this for posterity.’ He didn’t say to us, ‘Oh, by the way, we’re trying to capture this for the soundtrack.’"" ""We were recording all along, as we always did,"" says the band’s other keyboard player, Lisa Coleman. ""We felt really good about the songs, we really liked the set, and we knew the trucks were there recording, but it was just another show."" But the show was evidently important enough to Prince that Melvoin remembers him talking to the band before the set, to calm their nerves. ""When we were getting ready to go onstage, he said, ‘If you feel nervous, slow your body in half. So if you’re playing at 100 bpm, slow your body down to 50 bpm. Cut everything in half while you’re playing. Everything—every move, every thought you make, just cut it in half.’ It was an incredible piece of advice, because you know how long those jams can go, and if you get too excited and someone’s rushing, that’s one of the worst mistakes you can make in his band."" Prince hadn’t necessarily planned on using the First Avenue recordings on the actual album, but when he listened back to the tapes, he found that some of the new songs sounded good, in both performance and audio quality. Incredibly, not only ""Purple Rain,"" but also two other songs that were debuted that night—""I Would Die 4 U"" and ""Baby I’m a Star""—wound up being used on the final Purple Rain soundtrack (though the others were reworked more extensively than the title song was). The show gave a major running head start to a film project that continued to seem like a pipe dream to most of the people involved. To the musicians, it still wasn’t clear where the whole thing was headed. Almost exactly one year later, on July 28, 1984, Purple Rain opened in 900 theaters across the United States. It made back its cost of $7 million in its first weekend, and went on to clear nearly $70 million at the box office. The soundtrack album has sold more than 20 million copies worldwide, and spent 24 consecutive weeks at Number One on Billboard’s album chart. It won two Grammys and an Oscar, and included two Number One singles (""When Doves Cry"" and ""Let’s Go Crazy"") and another, the title track, that reached Number Two. In retrospect, maybe the Purple Rain phenomenon seems inevitable. Prince was the greatest pop genius of his time—on a very short list of music’s most gifted and visionary figures—and it was just a matter of his finding the vehicle that would translate his incomparable abilities to a wide audience. Yet in truth, when you look closer, the fact that the Purple Rain movie got made at all is hard to imagine, difficult to explain, and the result of many extraordinary leaps of faith on the part of virtually everyone involved in the production. Prior to this release, Prince was nowhere near a household name: While he had established himself in the R&B community, he had just one album that could be considered a mainstream hit, and no singles that had peaked above Number Six on the pop charts. He was also shrouded in mystery, surrounded by rumors about his ethnic background and sexual preference, and had completely stopped talking to the press as of the release of his previous album, 1999. At a suburban Cincinnati high school, my friends and I were already nothing short of obsessed with Prince, whose music felt like the culmination of all the sounds and styles we loved—dance beats, rock guitars, provocative lyrics, passionate vocals, style, glamor, intrigue. There was an extra locker in our senior class hallway, and we dedicated it to Prince, hanging the poster that came with the Controversy album (Prince in a shower, posed in front of a crucifix wearing nothing but bikini briefs, which I’m sure delighted our teachers and administrators) inside the door. We sent him a letter welcoming him to the Class of 1984, and got back a postcard with the handwritten words ""Love God"" stamped across his photo. Purple Rain was released just a few weeks after our graduation. Earlier that spring, we had all stayed up until midnight, cassette recorders at the ready, for the radio premiere of ""When Doves Cry."" On this mesmerizing, churning single, and then on eight more album tracks, we heard that he had modified his sound—focused and sharpened it, become a guitar god fronting a true rock & roll band. Oddly, the aura of apocalypse and religious salvation that had already begun to turn up in his work was, if anything, pulled even further forward, yet during the heart of the Reagan era, with the nuclear arms race at the top of everyone’s mind, this didn’t make his lyrics any less accessible for new listeners. The album seldom left our turntables in the weeks after it came out. We lined up to see the movie on opening weekend in late July. And we saw it over and over again the rest of the summer, mesmerized by the stunning performance sequences, repeating the campy but irresistible dialogue to each other. If any of our other friends weren’t previously on board with our Prince fixation, now the word-of-mouth street team was in full effect, and they simply couldn’t avoid hearing about him everywhere. And once their curiosity got the best of them and they took a chance on the movie, any lingering resistance was futile as soon as an off-screen voice intoned the first words—""Ladies and gentlemen, the Revolution,"" and a backlit Prince recited the opening words to ""Let’s Go Crazy."" When I got to college in the fall, I discovered that many of my new classmates were equally obsessed with Purple Rain — which meant that now we all had to go see it together, repeatedly, as part of the new bonds we were creating. (A few months later, my closest new friend and I took turns sleeping on the sidewalk in the snow to purchase tickets for the nearest stop on the Purple Rain tour.) Perhaps affluent, mostly white and mostly male kids weren’t initially the target audience for a Prince film, but what the world soon realized was that a $7 million investment gets paid back pretty quickly when groups of teenagers go to see a movie six or seven or eight times. Rocketown is an unassuming, warehouse-size club just a few blocks from the Bridgestone Arena in downtown Nashville. Geared to Christian teenagers, it’s adjacent to a skate park; there are pool tables upstairs, and the marquee lists a bunch of bands you’ve never heard of. It is now May 2004, 20 years after the release of Purple Rain, and Prince has already finished a sold-out performance at the arena (which was still called the Gaylord Center at the time), followed by an additional 90-minute set on Rocketown’s stage, after which he has an almost-three-week break in his touring schedule—""I gotta go home and water the plants,"" he tells the crowd of 500 or so, with a laugh. Prince is in the midst of one of his periodic resurgences in popularity, spurred by both music and strategy. After a series of experimental and even surly records, released in the midst of his ongoing battles with the music industry, his new album, Musicology, is accessible and funky; not a breakthrough or a true classic, it’s still a fully realized collection of satisfyingly Prince-style songs. He made some high-profile media appearances (opening the Grammy Awards broadcast performing a medley with Beyonce, singing for Ellen DeGeneres), delivered a knockout mini-set at his induction to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in March, and concocted a plan in which everyone who bought a ticket for the tour received a copy of Musicology on their seat—each of which counts toward SoundScan’s best-seller lists. Since the 96-date run would prove to be the top-grossing tour of the year, earning $87.4 million, this meant that the record would go gold and stay in the Top Ten for the whole summer even if not one person bought a copy in stores. So Prince is happy. He has also recently become a Jehovah’s Witness, and his conversation is now laced with frequent Biblical references and allusions. The after-show performance at Rocketown offers the musical manifestation of this new Prince. Where these intimate, late-night gigs used to be cathartic, virtuoso displays, this time he leads his band through a set of loose funk jams. He bops through the crowd to listen from the soundboard and roams the stage cueing the players through a mash-up of Led Zeppelin’s ""Whole Lotta Love"" and Santana’s ""Soul Sacrifice."" There’s no tension, all release. I’m there to interview him for a cover story for Tracks, a magazine I founded and edited in the early 2000s, and after the show, I observe something even more unlikely: At 2:30AM, Prince can be found standing outside the stage door, hanging with his band members and talking to fans. The 30 or so clustered civilians are breathlessly excited to be in his presence, yet seem understanding when he tells them that he doesn’t believe in signing autographs. He is, as always, shy and quiet, listening more than talking, but he actually seems to be enjoying the chance to mingle. One young woman tells him that Purple Rain was the first album she bought when she was in the first grade, but that her mother wouldn’t let her see the movie because it was too risqué. ""Just think about what ‘too risqué’ means today!"" Prince responds. Material from Purple Rain had provided the focus for the arena concert earlier in the evening. He performed seven of the album’s nine tracks during the 30-song, two-hour greatest hits set, closing with the title song. In the grimy Rocketown dressing room, though, he claims that the 20th anniversary of the project is of little consequence to him. ""I was there,"" he tells me. ""I did it, it was my baby. I knew about it before it happened. I knew what it was going to be. Then it was just like labor, like giving birth — in ‘84, it was so much work."" In fact, he says, just a few nights earlier in Atlanta, the Time—his Minneapolis friends / rivals / contemporaries who played his nemeses in the film, and sometimes in real life—came out and performed during his show. ""We never got a chance to do the real Purple Rain tour, because the Time broke up,"" he says. ""But then, there they were, onstage last week, and people started tripping, and I was watching my favorite band. So there’s no anniversary, no dates, we just have to have faith in Jehovah and lay back and ride it."" (The fact that Prince became a Jehovah’s Witness may also explain some of his attitude toward the anniversary of the album, since members of the religion do not celebrate birthdays.) Ten years later, his feelings about such milestones seem even more detached. In February 2014, Prince played a super-intimate performance for 10 people, held in the living room of his friend, singer Lianne La Havas, as part of a press conference to announce a series of upcoming ""hit-and-run"" UK shows. Matt Everitt of BBC 6 Music News was one of those in attendance, and he noted that Prince seemed surprised when he was asked about Purple Rain’s impending thirtieth anniversary. ""I hadn’t even realized,"" he said. ""Everything looks different to me, because I was there. I wrote those songs, I don’t need to know what happened."" A few weeks after that, he appeared as the only guest for an hour of the Arsenio Hall Show — yet another in a series of odd media visits without a tour or new release to support. An audience member asked him when he last saw Purple Rain, and what he thought of it. ""I was in the living room three days ago,"" said Prince, ""and it came on television, and I watched ‘Take Me With U.’"" He did not address the second part of the question. Every pop star presumably has some feelings of ambivalence about his or her biggest moment or defining hit. It immediately becomes both an obligation whenever you perform and the marker of a career pinnacle that, by definition, you can never match. Prince had a long run as one of the most successful musicians in the world, and can still sell out an arena pretty much whenever he wants to. He’s had an impressive half-dozen records certified two- to four-times platinum, with 1999 (which predated Purple Rain) highest on that list, but he has never had an album with sales close to Purple Rain’s 13 million in the US. Indeed, he once described Purple Rain as ""my albatross—it’ll be hanging around my neck as long as I’m making music."" Whatever his feelings about the legacy of Purple Rain, though, Prince has always kept its songs front and center in his shows—especially the title song. It has served as the climax of most of his concerts, including his 2007 Super Bowl halftime show in Miami, which was seen by 93 million people in the US alone and is generally considered the gold standard of all performances at sporting events. (Over the years, ""Purple Rain"" has also been covered by a wide range of artists, from LeAnn Rimes to Foo Fighters, Etta James to Tori Amos, Phish to Elvis Costello, while other songs from the album have been recorded by everyone from Mariah Carey to Patti Smith.) A December 2013 concert at Connecticut’s Mohegan Sun Arena saw Prince at his latter-day loosest; he introduced the night by saying ""We’re gonna just jam tonight—it’s just an old-school party,"" and largely stayed away from the hits, digging deep into his catalog (including a quick run through ""Jungle Love"" and ""The Bird,"" the two songs by the Time featured in Purple Rain) as he alternated between a 21-piece, horn-heavy funk ensemble and his stripped-down, all-female rock trio, 3rd Eye Girl. Still, the inevitable closer, as a second encore, was a heartfelt rendition of ""Purple Rain,"" with a tender vocal and winding guitar solo that saw him exploring the indelible melody as if it were a brand-new composition. Like that night at First Avenue 30 years earlier, he stood in the spotlight and an audience stood thrilled and riveted by what they heard—despite, or because of, the fact that this room of middle-aged, mostly white concertgoers was able to sing every note, anticipate every turn of the song, and had been able to do so for the majority of their years on Earth. From all of Prince’s groundbreaking work, it is Purple Rain that endures first and foremost. It will always be the defining moment of a magnificent, fascinating — if often erratic — career. It carries the weight of history. Its success, on screen and as a recording, was a result of the supreme confidence, laser-focused ambition, and visionary nature of the most gifted artist of his generation. Dancing on the line between fact and fiction, Prince utilized his mysterious persona to hyper-charge the film’s story with tension and revelation. He let us in — only partway, certainly not enough to rupture his myth, but more than he ever did before or since. Defying all odds, a group of inexperienced filmmakers and actors, working against the clock and against the brutal Minneapolis weather, clicked for just long enough to make a movie that the public was starving for, even if they didn’t quite know it at first. ""We just wanted to do something good and something true,"" says director Albert Magnoli. ""The producer was on the same page, we had an artist who wanted the same things, a group of musicians who felt the same way. It was one of the very few times when everybody actually wanted to make the same movie—which sounds obvious, but is actually very, very rare in the movie business."" ""I think part of the success of Purple Rain was that [Prince] did open up and examine himself, and that it was real,"" says Lisa Coleman. ""It was an authentic thing, and you could feel it, and there was all this excitement around it. And I don’t think he’s done that ever again."" Purple Rain came along at precisely the right moment — not just for Prince, but for the culture. The summer of 1984 was an unprecedented season, a collision of blockbuster records and the ascension of music video that created perhaps the biggest boom that pop will ever experience. It was also a time of great transformation for black culture, when a series of new stars, new projects, and new styles would forever alter the racial composition of music, movies, and television. While the magnificence of the Purple Rain songs remains clear 30 years later, the album and the film were also perfectly in tune with the time and place in which they were created, and their triumph was partly the result of impeccable timing and circumstances that could never be repeated or replicated. The first time we heard the songs on the radio, the first time we put on the album, the first time the lights in the movie theater went down, we all did just what the man told us: we went crazy.

Battered by a long journey, our titular hero and his band have just come upon a village full of slaughtered peasants. Moments later, riders on horseback emerge from a sandstorm like ghosts, and, save for Marco and his merchant father and uncle, slay the entire group in a flurry of arrows. The scene is brutal, almost otherworldly, and there’s a palpable sense of terror as the surviving trio is taken as prisoners to face the dreaded Kublai Khan, Mongol Emperor and the most powerful man in the world.  On paper, the stakes are high, and the production value is strong enough to support that. Still, there’s something expected, almost rote about it. By the time Marco meets Kublai Khan, we more or less know what beats to expect. This will be a story about human suffering, war, political intrigue, and other themes we’ve seen before — mostly on HBO.  It’s clear Netflix has lofty ambitions to turn Marco Polo into its new premiere offering, the kind of blockbuster it hopes people will only increase its cachet on the heels of buzzy titles like House of Cards and Orange Is the New Black. And from the start, it’s clear that this is meant to be a sweeping period piece unlike anything we’ve seen before. The problem is that it’s even more evident that the streaming company spared no expense cribbing HBO’s playbook in terms of style and tone. For all its scale, the whole thing just feels like Game of Thrones in China. Attractive white people you’re supposed to root for? Check. A war between the North and the South? Check. An ambitious, corrupt courtly figure? Check. Animals used to represent warring factions? Check. A commitment to over-the-top violence? Check. Brothels? Check. Exotic location shoots? Check. It’s not a carbon copy, of course; you won’t find dragons or ice zombies here. But if you replace GoT’s fantasy elements with blind Kung fu masters and vague, mystical homilies about Genghis Khan, this is roughly the result. The one thing Marco Polo potentially has over Game of Thrones is its real-life historic roots, following Polo’s time in the Mongol court in the years before the Yuan Dynasty. And rather than focus on fictional rival families like the Starks and Lannisters, the show, to its credit, focuses mainly on the burgeoning dynamic between Marco Polo and Kublai Khan. Marco, played by Italian actor Lorenzo Richelmy, is left in the care of the great Khan because he has a gift with words. We see him learn how to survive in Mongol society, and slowly develop a bond with his captors. As played by British actor Benedict Wong, Khan is a hard yet magnetic ruler preparing for war with the southern Song dynasty. Marco and Khan develop a borderline familial relationship over the course of the first two hours, putting Marco in a precarious position within the court. For a while, one almost cares. But it’s not enough to keep the the whole from feeling middling, and no one undoes this entire production more than Richelmy in the title role. The supporting cast pulls their weight: Wong is a force to be reckoned with, cutting an imposing yet surprisingly warm figure as the hours march on. Chin Han, who you may recognize from The Dark Knight, plays an unctuous Song advisor known colloquially as ""the cricket minister,"" and you’re content to hate him about as much as Thrones’ Littlefinger. Twin Peaks’ Joan Chen plays Kublai Khan’s wife Empress Chabi, and she’s a soft-spoken yet powerful presence when she’s onscreen (which sadly, is not nearly enough.) But Marco Polo, the series’ lead, is boring as a character, and Richelmy is bland no matter what emotion he’s trying to express. No matter what he’s given to do — falling in love with a fellow captive, learning Kung fu from his blind teacher Hundred Eyes — he’s dull. The entire series rests on his shoulders, and he’s just not up to it. That’s the thing: Medieval warfare should be fun. It matters less that Marco Polo is lifting from Game of Thrones, and more that it has failed to elevate the form with its own unique performances and innovative storytelling. And since the elements that it can call its own never quite get out from under the shadow of what’s been borrowed, the final product feels like a cynical copy of what’s come before, this time with more Eastern flavor. You could easily argue that that’s how Hollywood works and has worked forever — if something succeeds, copy the formula until it stops succeeding. But Marco Polo was supposed to be a crucial part of Netflix’s effort to legitimize itself as the next HBO. It’s clear that it’s going to take more than $90 million to pull that off.

Every December, we perform the same activities, trying to capture the bliss of years past. You might spend hours decorating a gingerbread house or grooming a tree. I set the Sufjan Stevens Christmas playlist on infinite loop. You've probably heard of Stevens' reams of Christmas material, but maybe you've never given it a proper listen. Here is everything you need to know. Over the last decade or so, Stevens has released 100 Christmas songs. Some tunes are modern originals, while others are from auld lang syne (including ""Auld Lang Syne."") The music is spread across 10 albums available for purchase in two volumes, Songs for Christmas and Silver & Gold. Stevens' yuletide catalog transcends the treacly holiday tunes favored by easy listening radio stations and musty shopping complexes. It borrows hyperbolic enthusiasm of obligatory pop star holiday albums, while highlighting the season’s social, economical, and existential pressures. It exists in the emotional gray space between euphoria and bottomless depression. To celebrate both the holiday season and Stevens' titanic ode to it, I, an unabashed fan, have ranked every single song that is on either of his two Christmas albums. This is perhaps the best compliment I can give the music: listening to these songs ad nauseam has not made me sick of them. While looking through the list, feel free to play songs from both albums, which are available to stream on Spotify and buy on Bandcamp, iTunes or Amazon. Songs for Christmas: &lt;a href=""http://music.sufjan.com/album/songs-for-christmas"" mce_href=""http://music.sufjan.com/album/songs-for-christmas""&gt;Songs for Christmas by Sufjan Stevens&lt;/a&gt; Silver & Gold: &lt;a href=""http://music.sufjan.com/album/silver-gold"" mce_href=""http://music.sufjan.com/album/silver-gold""&gt;Silver &amp;amp; Gold by Sufjan Stevens&lt;/a&gt; I'll write in detail about the top 10 songs, but here's the entire list in condensed form:       I had two mindsets going into building this list: 1) Which tracks am I most likely to skip when I go through these albums every Christmas season (November 1 to December 26)? 2) Which tracks do I most often want to share with my friends and family who aren't familiar with Sufjan Stevens? Slots 100 through 80 were fairly easy – ""Particle Physics"" and ""Eternal Happiness or Woe"" are straight-up ambient songs that would kill the Christmas mood, either alone or with people. And sadly, the chunk of Volume 7 gets the short end of the stick; I don't mind listening to it once in a while, but I could see scenarios where people look confused while listening to a freak folk Christmas song called ""Ding-a-ling-a-ring-a-ling."" That being said, ""Mr. Frosty Man"" prevailed to the top 30, simply because of the line ""He's got a friend called Coolio, Vanilla Ice, and Ice Cube."" The rest of the list is based on what I intuitively believe would appeal to the most people, with the top 10 being ready for airwaves across these great United States Stevens once planned to praise with individual concept albums. That was a simpler time. Feel free to discuss in the comments whether ""Come On! Let's Boogey to the Elf Dance!"" should get a higher slot than ""Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas."" One more thing before the Top 10: I want to give honorable mentions to some selected tracks:  15. Christmas Unicorn [Volume 10]   This 12-minute (no, really) Silver & Gold closer has Stevens proclaiming he's a ""Christmas unicorn."" He's a really long list of Christmas concepts mashed up into one majestic creature. It's like, a marketing firm hired Stevens to create a new Christmas character and a jingle, and after he sang this song, the marketing department — confused and dumbstruck — fired this peculiar man. It's possible that this is an implicit admission that making all this Christmas music was a crazy idea. But he ultimately embraces this, and suspects that you all secretly love his Christmas albums (guilty as charged), and he invites everyone to shamelessly indulge in the spirit of Christmas, unicorns, and Joy Division.  12. Do You Hear What I Hear? [Volume 8]   I know I said I sorted this list out by what I believe would appeal to the most people. But rules are meant to be broken sometimes. This is probably the craziest cover of this song, and doing a 180-degree turn right after the more reserved ""Angels We Have Heard on High"" on Volume 8 is why I gave it such a high ranking. It's like a Warp Records artist invaded the studio and made this, which ends with four minutes of auto-tuned vocal runs, chanting, and electronic tribal drumming. I like to play this for people just to see how they react, after being comfortable with Whitney Houston's version for two decades. If Hasbro ever decides to make a Transformers Christmas special, I hope they use this song for the montage where the Autobots decorate Cybertron. 42. Alphabet St. [Volume 8] I know what you're thinking: Why is the cover of Prince's ""Alphabet St."" that high on the list? It is not about Christmas, it's about trying to get someone to sleep with them via the sexual magic powers of a '67 Ford Thunderbird. Answer: Stevens can do what he wants, when he wants – he's scoring a slow motion rodeo as of this writing, for goodness sake – so it would be foolish to question him — or Prince, for that matter. The Top 10: 10. Carol of St. Benjamin The Bearded One [Volume 6]   What first sounds like a remix of Mykola Leontovych's ""Carol of the Bells,"" transitions into a pretty somber song. Having had no context before this feature, I always pictured Ben as a mystical creature in plaid, basically Al Borland, roaming through a snow-filled forest. But I enjoy the message in the first (and last) verse: If you want something, it ought to be for a good reason. It's a message that shares similarities with...  9. Justice Delivers Its Death [Volume 10]   The penultimate song of Silver & Gold has Stevens taking a 180-degree turn on Johnny Marks' original song, and criticizing its ideas of silver and gold being inherently pleasurable. This is the perfect soundtrack for YouTube videos of Black Friday shoppers fighting discounted waffle irons. (Thankfully, someone already had this idea.) It's not a happy song by any means, but it does bring a metaphorical and honest light to the unfavorable parts of the holiday season: avarice over selflessness, the yuletide existential crisis that Charlie Brown suffered in December 1965.  8. Silent Night [Volume 6]   This track is probably the best example of why I prefer Stevens' arrangements of Christmas music over other artists'. He keeps the lullaby feel of the hymn that people know well and transforms a couple major chords into minor ones, giving the song a more haunting vibe. He's made similar arrangements with other Christmas tunes (see both versions of ""Joy to the World,"" one of which contains a short refrain of ""Impossible Soul"" from Age of Adz, and ""Away in a Manger""), but ""Silent Night"" is my favorite.  7. The Child With The Star On His Head [Volume 8]   The longest Christmas song from Stevens (15 minutes and 30 seconds) is a slow jam where he relates baby Jesus to technological advances and the trust ""we put in things."" Which is to say it may be the most Sufjan Stevens-esque song of all. The chorus has a catchy melody that may cause you to hum repeatedly. But around the five-minute mark is where things get interesting. A drum machine replaces the live drums; there's a guitar solo, possibly two or more that are layered over each other; computer buzzes and wails slowly hit; everything begins to sound sinister and chaotic. Then the instruments disappear and we're left with ambient noises for five minutes, until a high-pitched buzz builds up, nips your eardrums, then cuts out. What would a top 10 be without a slow, scary space jam about baby Jesus.  6. Come Thou Fount of Every Blessing [Volume 2]   The one word that comes to mind whenever I hear this song is ""community."" Stevens open with only his voice and trusty banjo. As the song progresses, more instruments and singers join, until it's a chorus of la-la-la's. It feels like he wandered and sang down an empty street, the townsfolk gradually leaving their holiday obligations, succumbing to the spirit of the moment. Then they all went to Olive Garden for soup, salad, and bread sticks. Even though this is a Christian hymn, Stevens' rendition feels welcoming to everyone.  5. Star of Wonder [Volume 5]   Prior to figuring that ""star of wonder"" was a reference to the Christmas star that led the Three Wise Men to baby Jesus, I kept envisioning this as a song about two people lost in space and finding each other. The lyrics are still a little too cryptic to unpack. But this song's biggest draw for me is the production. You'd think this track involved about 15 to 20 people, but the credits reveal it was four. Most of the luscious sound came from Stevens playing 11 different instruments himself. Even though it's not that amazing of a feat (everyone does multitrack recording these days), ""Star of Wonder's"" sound in the last half overwhelms me every time I listen to it.  4. Sister Winter [Volume 5]   Winter can be a crappy season. The days feel shorter, the cold air stings your skin, the snow has dog pee in it, and sometimes it can feel as if there's painful distance between you and the people you care about. Even if that distance is just a few, snow-covered blocks. This Stevens song captures the winter depression, but also the love between friends old and new. Christmas song or not, it's gorgeous any time of the year. I get goose bumps from Stevens and Marla Hansen's falsetto chorus, the string section, the horn section, the build-up (it seems like there are many moments like that in Sufjan's Christmas tunes), and the cool down.  3. Barcarola (You Must Be a Christmas Tree) [Volume 6]   Real talk: I get choked up almost every time I listen to this song. It's probably because of ""Barcarola's"" sad, slow melody (a barcarola is a folk tune sung by gondoliers, distinct for sounding and feeling like you're riding a gondola, and boy, this boat ride sure is slow.) The lyrics feel like a check list of rich holiday memories: being indecisive while writing a gift wish list, conversation with parents, and falling in love in the soft Christmas glow. I would probably never want to go back to the days past, but ""Barcarola"" manages to conjure memories with such ease. It feels good to look back sometimes.  2. That Was The Worst Christmas Ever! [Volume 3]   Christmas doesn't always live up to our expectations. What you thought was going to be exciting turns out to be mundane, the happy time at the dinner table you concocted in your head actually becomes a fight over overcooked turkey. In the same way the Illinois classic ""Casimir Pulaski Day"" had a narrative, this one does too, albeit in a subtler way. At first, the kid in the song does the standard things kids do while on winter break: shoveling snow and riding sleds. But when Christmas day comes, his abusive father throws the gifts in a fire, causing his sister to run away, testing the kid's faith. It is the saddest Christmas song in his catalog (though not the saddest of all Christmas songs – thanks, Tom Waits). It's also one of Stevens' most memorable, thanks to its simple chords, the repeating ""Casimir""-like sound, and Shara Worden's vocals that keep going until her voice is all that's left.  1. Christmas In The Room [Volume 8]   When you take away all the superficial qualities of Christmas — the lights, the décor, the presents, the TV specials, the Christmas movies, Black Friday, Boxing Day, and the pageantry — what is there left to care about? (I mean, aside from, you know, the religious aspects at the center of the holiday season, should they carry importance to you.) After years of recording so many (perhaps too many) Christmas songs, it seems that Sufjan found the answer: each other. And I mean ""each other"" in the communal sense. Sure, ""Christmas in the Room"" is basically a love song about two people who have no desire to do anything special for Christmas, but there's no limit to love for your fellow, multiple neighbors (or strangers.) ""No gifts to give, they're all right here / inside our hearts, the glorious cheer,"" sings Stevens, verbally (and kindly) smacking us upside the head, reminding us that people — be it the family you haven't seen in a while, the friends who support you, your lover – are the most important part of the Christmas season. Stevens didn't produce all these songs alone; he had his friends by his side from the first album to the 10th. ""Christmas in the Room,"" his best Christmas song, is a thank you to that community, from family to fellow musicians to fans. Stevens put this song up on the public domain, so you're welcome to share his song with the people who help you throughout the year. Let's not forget that we're all in this — his yuletide roller-coaster of emotions — together. Happy holidays, and have a happy new year.

Like Mad Men, it is a workplace period piece about a white alpha male adrift in a swingin' new media landscape, only instead of taking place half a century ago, it takes place in the intellectual dark ages of roughly 2010-13. Its original targets were the kind of Fox News / Nancy Grace types usually more succinctly lambasted by Jon Stewart, but over the last couple of seasons, it — or rather its creator, Aaron Sorkin — has realized his common-decency princess is in another castle: the internet. And who's holding her hostage? A bunch of ladies, probably. There was plenty of precedence for ""Oh Shenandoah,"" last night's jaw-droppingly offensive campus rape episode. (Let us never forget the time Sorkin called writer Sarah Nicole Prickett ""Internet Girl"" for daring to be a female human with a Twitter account who did not love his new show.) And this season, we got a whole arc around Grace Gummer's character Hallie, who worked in social media for ACN before getting fired for an inflammatory tweet and subsequently going to work for fictional Gawker stand-in Carnivore. At Carnivore, Hallie is given pageview bonuses and encouraged to write about her personal life — specifically her ""experience with Plan B,"" which her boyfriend Jim, one of the show's several noble-but-flawed nice guys, likens to a Penthouse letter. Watching Jim and Hallie fight about journalistic integrity this season has been invigorating and infuriating, and as other critics have pointed out, Sorkin has gotten better at letting both sides of an argument get good and mostly intelligent points made; his strawmen have been more diligently stuffed. In the end, though, it's little more than a ruse — while the dialogue is more substantial, we're still meant to reach a final conclusion: Internet: Bad. And more specifically, Internet In The Hands of Women: Bad. Sorkin's strawmen have been more diligently stuffed, but it's still a ruse It's enough to make an Internet Girl feel like someone's switched out her birth control for crazy pills — which I'm sure is part of its gaslight-y intention. We hear Hallie and this week's campus rape victim Mary (played with perfectly righteous emotion by Veep's Sarah Sutherland) say all the right things and lay out all the same arguments that we've made in private and on our Twitter feeds. Yet the scene is not written from their point of view, but rather from that of the men who tell them that their methods are flawed and dangerous. It makes you wish Sorkin had opted to write these women as the cartoonish harpies they would have been in the show's first season; it would be easier to laugh them off. To know that he hears these arguments and still feels the need to defend the status quo — that is, a media conversation dominated by old-school male voices — lays bare just how out of touch one of film and television's most prominent voices is with the intellectual ecosystem he has chosen to depict. That's why I could eventually laugh over the closing credits after the absurd death of Charlie Skinner, who was literally killed by new media. Because as angry as the episode made me and so many others, I knew it was coming from a man who on some level knew he was on the losing side of a cultural tide, and was helplessly furious about it. Full disclosure: a personal friend of mine, Alena Smith, was a writer on this season of The Newsroom, and I knew this episode was coming as far back as June. I also knew that she was nearly fired for objecting to Sorkin's depiction of the Princeton campus rape cover-up. (Obviously, this story was broken and written long before Rolling Stone's UVA rape story debacle; it's just some kind of cosmic joke that the episode happened to air the exact same week.) The picture she painted of a red-faced, sputtering Sorkin screaming at her from the top of a stairwell both seemed like a scene straight from the very show they were arguing about and a portrait of an '80s man flailing in the face of a cultural shift.  As @emilynussbaum points out in her review of tonight's ep, you can't criticize Sorkin without turning into one of his characters.  So when I tried to argue, in the writers' room, that we maybe skip the storyline where a rape victim gets interrogated by a random man...  I ended up getting kicked out of the room and screamed at just like Hallie would have for a ""bad tweet."" In fairness, it's not as if every building block of Sorkin's argument is flawed; Don is correct to point out that a site for anonymously naming rapists would eventually be abused by someone at some point. But his solution is never to adapt, to find a way to handle the anarchy and anonymity of the internet and new media. And it's certainly never to respect a woman's desire to express herself in whatever way she feels is appropriate. Sorkin is clearly terrified of the internet and the floodgate it opens for non-white-male voices to be heard and taken seriously, and he truly, laughably believes that we'd be better off without it. For Sorkin, the most egregious crime is not the violation of a woman's body, but the violation of a man's right to benefit from the status quo — which conveniently includes the daily violation and silencing of women. For Sorkin, the most egregious crime is the violation of a man's right to benefit from the status quo You have to wonder how Sorkin would treat a web-bred firestorm like GamerGate — a story in which Internet Girls found themselves under continuous attack by a largely anonymous group of predominantly male commenters. How would he have dealt with the idea that female voices are still routinely threatened and attacked online? Chances are he would have brushed it aside, as it doesn't match up with his victim complex. But given his concerns with ethics in journalism, maybe we should be glad we'll never have the chance to find out. Alena also butted heads with Sorkin over Edward Snowden and the NSA leaks, the most important news story of 2013, which got shunted into a C-plot on last night's episode. You will never guess what position Sorkin had on the leak, but if you were listening carefully last night, you could hear him muttering to himself via John Gallagher's Jim in a scene in the Moscow airport on the day Snowden was scheduled to fly to Cuba. Jim: I want to ask him about when he decided to declare war on the United States. Maggie: So I think you should let me get the ball rolling. Jim: You and your whole generation's contempt for institutions. It's a joke, but, you know, it's really not a joke. It's one last fist-shaking from an old man whose mostly unwatched ethical soap opera was more or less quietly shown the door by HBO. Honestly, we should pity Aaron Sorkin — he doesn't have a Twitter account or a BuzzFeed byline by which to influence public thought. All he has is one hour on Sunday on a premium cable network. And this time next week, he won't even have that.",0.3459223422102605,0.6540776577897395,0.187119844015313,1253,4.7039106145251397,634,5.9858044164037851,0,0,"Culture, Entertainment, Essay",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Without it, getting online in your home or office can be a hassle, but beyond that, there's not much to say. The Almond routers from Securifi have a different approach. They want to be the central hub for your future smartphone, providing internet and acting as the main hub for countless connected devices. Today, the Almond 2015 and Almond+ routers are getting an update that makes them even smarter. The Almond+ and Almond 2015 are slick-looking routers with easy-to-use touchscreen interfaces. The Almond+ is the bigger brother, with high-powered antennas and gigabit networking ports, while the Almond 2015 is smaller and cheaper, and probably the better option if you don't need to cover a huge home. But both offer the same smart home hub features to connect all kinds of household appliances, such as thermostats, lightbulbs, locks, motion detectors, and more. High-speed networking and a touchscreen interface make the Almond+ an attractive option to an Asus or Netgear Today's update adds the ability to create automated functions that link various devices together. For instance, you can program the Almond router to automatically turn a light on for a set period of time when a door opens or activate the sprinklers in the yard when the outside temperature reaches a certain point. Programming these automated rules can be done via the touchscreen on the Almond or through its web interface.   With more and more appliances gaining connected abilities, managing them all in your home can be a chore. Almond's routers provide an easy way to manage a bunch of disparate sensors and make them work together, all the while working as capable internet routers. The Almond+, which normally retails for $249 and is available for $199 for a limited time, can cover a 5,000-square-foot home with its dual antennas and offers 2.4GHz and 5GHz Wi-Fi networks with 802.11ac support. It's comparable to similarly priced routers from Asus or Netgear, but with the added benefit of the smart home hub and touchscreen interface. The smaller Almond 2015 normally retails for $149 and lacks some of the Almond+'s advanced features, such as dual-band Wi-Fi, gigabit ports, and USB 3.0 ports (the Almond 2015 has a USB 2.0 port). Neither the Almond+ or the Almond 2015 will give the crazy D-Link AC3200 Ultra a run for its money in terms of performance or scary appearance. But if you're looking for a router that can power your future (or present!) smart home, they are very interesting options.",0.589677390094862,0.410322609905138,0.1639550842158275,462,5.0064935064935066,254,6.106299212598425,0,2,"Home, Tech",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Today, Microsoft is putting Spartan, its new browser, at the center of Windows 10 to slay off the old, weak, and beleaguered Internet Explorer.  Microsoft might not be fully killing off Internet Explorer the app, but a new brand name will herald a new era for the company’s browser prospects and a signal to web developers that Internet Explorer will soon be part of ancient history.  Project Spartan is just a codename for now, but I’ve had a chance to experience Microsoft’s new browser in Windows 10, the successor to Internet Explorer. The first thing you’ll notice about Project Spartan is just how basic and minimalist it looks. Part of that might be because it’s lacking all the final features, but it’s mainly because Microsoft is clearly thinking about stripping this back for the modern era. While Internet Explorer 11 is basic itself, Spartan builds upon that by hiding away features like Reading List and the settings panel behind modern icons. There’s buttons to access favorites, reading view, a new Web Notes feature, and a section for reading list, favorites management, history, and the download manager. It’s all based on a sliding sidebar, and it feels like the right way to access features and settings. Spartan’s interface is rather basic for now, and there’s no sign of any extra clever tab management just yet, but that’s part of its appeal. The address bar and tabs are where you’d expect to find them, and everything feels like it’s staying out of the way to let you surf the web. That feeling is very similar to how I felt using the modern IE in Windows 8.1, but Spartan doesn’t go far enough just yet. Disappointingly, there’s no immersive fullscreen experience that’s optimized for touch, and it feels a little clunky navigating with your fingers. I’m hopeful that Microsoft is simply working to bring this in future updates, because it would be a mistake to lose that great finger-friendly browsing experience from Windows 8.1 for tablets. Spartan looks a little spartan As this is only a very early preview, performance isn’t great. Scrolling and opening new tabs can be laggy and random, and I noticed you can’t double click the title bar to maximize Spartan. These issues will obviously be worked out ready for the final release, but it’s worth noting in case you’re thinking about using Windows 10 and Spartan day to day. It’s not ready for daily use just yet. The most impressive new feature for me personally is the inking and annotation support. Microsoft originally demonstrated this by drawing all over a Verge article back in January, and it was the first thing I decided to test. If you’re using something like the Surface Pro 3 with a stylus, you can simply hit the Web Note button and start inking all over a webpage. There are options to change the ink color, highlighting tools, a way to add comment notes, and even a snippet tool. It’s a fun experience, but I couldn’t help but feel it would be even more fun and useful if you could ink in real-time with others. Once you’re done drawing all over a webpage, you can share it via email, upload it to OneDrive, or store it in OneNote. Not all of these sharing options are enabled just yet, but Microsoft is planning to support them in the final version of Project Spartan. This seems to be the big selling point of Spartan, and the inking will also work without a stylus on a touchscreen machine or by using a mouse. Everyone will be able to draw on the web with Windows 10. Cortana integration is the second key feature in Project Spartan. While Windows 10 has Cortana built in for search, the digital assistant gets a little more clever in the browser. You can right-click on words on a website and Cortana will find search results for them, and the digital assistant will even automatically find driving directions to a store or restaurant if you’re browsing a particular site. If you visit Cuoco’s website, an Italian restaurant in Seattle, Cortana pops up near the address bar with suggestions for opening hours and driving directions. It’s a neat trick. Cortana also works in the address bar when you’re searching. If you start typing ""weather,"" it will automatically surface local weather straight in the address bar, alongside information on stocks. Microsoft is also adding in the ability to see flight information in there in future, and you can imagine there are many more scenarios where you might want to see quick information without hitting enter for full search results. The Cortana integration is welcome, and I’d like to see more of this in future updates. While Reading View was part of the Modern IE in Windows 8.1, Microsoft is bringing it to the desktop fully with Spartan and Windows 10. It’s very similar to before, and provides a stripped-back reading experience that’s ideal on a tablet or laptop. I found that it doesn’t always work on every page, particularly large ones or ones with a lot of imagery, but it’s ideally suited for article pages, and it declutters everything to focus on the text. Reading List is a new addition that syncs URLs between devices and provides a way to read PDFs or webpages offline. It’s not fully enabled in the preview just yet, but it will work similar to the Reading List app for Windows 8.1. I’ve found that Reading List works well if you’re browsing a site on your phone and want to transfer it quickly over to your PC, and it’s a feature that Apple already has in Safari. Perhaps the biggest change to Spartan that you won’t really notice is a new rendering engine. Microsoft is moving away from the complexity and legacy of Internet Explorer, and it’s starting fresh with Project Spartan. The new Edge rendering engine is designed to be modern, so there’s no support for ActiveX controls and rendered pages should be a lot more compatible thanks to more standards compliancy. I’ve found that some pages don’t render well at the moment, and it has a few quirks here and there, but it’s preview so these kinks will likely be ironed out by the time Spartan ships in the summer. One impressive thing I've noticed is the small amount of RAM usage for tabs. It's usually less than the same site in Internet Explorer, so once the performance issues are fixed this could be a very fast and bloat-free browser. Extensions are still missing right now, and that’s a big miss for Spartan. Microsoft is making a number of good steps, but to truly compete with Chrome it needs good extensions support. Microsoft was slow to implement tabs back in the Internet Explorer days, and it feels like the company is once again dragging its feet. While you could argue extensions are a niche function, they matter to a lot of people who spend their life in the browser. However, Microsoft has committed to bringing extensions to Project Spartan, and we’re hoping to hear more about them at the company’s Build conference next month. It’s unlikely that they’ll be ready for the summer ship time though. The future of Project Spartan looks bright. Microsoft is taking a step away from the Internet Explorer legacy, and the initial preview seems promising. The key to Spartan’s future will be how quickly Microsoft can adapt its rendering engine and provide updates to consumers running Windows 10. Google has set the standard here with regular Chrome updates, and Microsoft really needs to follow that pace if it wants to catch up and push Spartan into the future.",0.6431950986078018,0.3568049013921982,0.19641469355967275,1312,4.8323170731707314,571,5.9964973730297721,0,32,"Microsoft, Tech, Hands-on",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

As easier way of keeping photos of your kid in one spot Scrapbooks can serve as a private album if parents wish, but they can just as easily be shared with your family and other Facebook friends. Facebook quickly noticed the popular trend of parents tagging their significant other in any photos featuring their child, which made for a roundabout way of keeping those shots in a central place and making them visible for two sets of friends.   But as TechCrunch lays out, Scrapbook makes everything a bit simpler. By heading into Facebook's family and relationships section, you can set up a Scrapbook for your own child. Only parents themselves can make a Scrapbook, and for your partner to add photos or change privacy settings, you'll need to be linked via Facebook's relationship status section. (That could make things slightly awkward for divorcés.) Once set up, Facebook will run through tagged photos of both parents to help you quickly pick out those featuring your child. From there, Scrapbook appears as its own photo album, and you'll be able to tag your kid's name in pictures posted by friends, as well. Scrapbook is launching first in the US on the web, iOS, and Android. As for what's next, Facebook told TechCrunch that it's still toying with ways to evolve Scrapbook into full profiles once children reach 13.

But Google and its OEM partners are slowly starting to expand the definition of what makes a Chromebook. The 15-inch Acer Chromebook is a good example of a new market Chromebooks are entering — and today Google and Asus are announcing another new Chromebook that takes aim at another popular Windows form factor. The new Asus Chromebook Flip is unlike any other on the market. At 10.1 inches, it's even smaller than most Chromebooks on the market, but the all-metal chassis is much stronger and premium-feeling than most of its plastic-built relatives. And like a number of Windows laptops, the Flip’s hinge can bend all the way around so the device can be used in tablet mode. Of course, that means the Flip’s screen is a touchscreen, something only seen on a few other Chromebooks thus far. The onboard accelerometer means you can easily use the Flip in either portrait or landscape; the preproduction hardware and software made the switch without any trouble. Chrome OS still isn't really designed with touch in mind, but those touchscreen features should get a lot more use soon — Google says that as of today, any Android developer can start using the App Runtime for Chrome (still in beta). That means those developers will be able to port their Android apps right over to Chrome OS with minimal hassle, something Google first announced back at I/O last year. Chrome OS is slowly but surely becoming more suited to touchscreens Until now, though, Google has only let a handful of developers (including Evernote and Vine) launch their Android apps on Chrome. We should soon start to see a lot more Android apps running on Chrome OS, which will make the Flip’s touchscreen capabilities a lot more useful. And Chrome OS now includes Android’s virtual keyboard, so if you need to enter some text while using the Flip in tablet mode you won’t have to turn the computer back around into laptop mode. It’s smart enough to not bring up the virtual keyboard when you’re using it as a touch-enabled laptop, as well. There’s one other new addition coming to Chrome OS soon that’s worth nothing — the ""app launcher"" in the lower left corner of the screen is being replaced. Now you’ll see something very similar to the Google app on Android when you click it. You’ll get a search bar, your most recent apps, and a full view of your Google Now cards. If you want to see every app you have, there’s a button to bring them all up next to your recent apps. It’s a small change, but one that brings Chrome OS and Android just a little bit closer together. New Asus, Hisense, and Haier ChromebooksPreviousNextView full GalleryPreviousNext   To keep the Flip running without fans and to keep battery life long, Asus has gone with an ARM-based chipset — the Rockchip 3288. It’s based on the quad-core Cortex-A17 architecture and runs at up to 1.8GHz. It has 2GB or 4GB of RAM and a 16GB hard drive, while the touchscreen is an IPS display with a 1280x800 resolution — slightly better than most other 11-inch Chromebooks out there. How exactly the Rockchip will stack up to other fanless chipsets like those from Intel and Nvidia remains to be seen — we’ll need to put the machine through some extensive testing before we can say for sure. The Chromebook Flip doesn't really have a direct competitor All in all, the Asus Chromebook Flip seems like it could be a solid option for those looking for a small Chromebook with better construction than other models currently on the market — or if you’re a big fan of the touchscreen and think Android apps on Chrome could be useful for you. And at $250, it’s right in line with the price of most other Chromebooks, and there’s no doubt it looks better than most of the black or white plastic models we’ve seen. Google says it’ll be available sometime in the next six to eight weeks. The Flip wasn't the only intriguing new Chrome OS hardware Asus is working on, however — the company appears to have taken inspiration from the Chromecast to built a tiny dongle called the Chromebit. It takes essentially the same hardware found in the Flip and crushes it into the dongle; from there you can just plug it into basically any screen with an HDMI port and get a Chrome OS computer running. There’s only one USB port, but it has Bluetooth for keyboards and mice. There’s no battery; you’ll need to plug it in with micro USB for power. Google says the $99 device is aimed at making it easier and cheaper for educational institutions to deploy more computers, particularly in an international setting. The company also envisions it being used in kiosks or by anyone who might want to throw a tiny computer in their bag while traveling. It’s definitely a cool and unusual idea, but again we’ll have to see how well it runs before we can judge whether it’s worth owning. The Chromebit is scheduled to be available sometime this summer.   Beyond the Asus hardware Google showed off, the company also introduced some new products that are available for pre-order today: new Chromebooks from Chinese manufacturers Hisense and Haier. Unlike the Chromebook Flip, Hisense and Haier are each introducing their own pretty standard take on the 11-inch Chromebook. Both have the same hardware as the new Asus models, including the Rockchip processor, but these machines at least come in at a very affordable $149. Laptop handles are back I got a chance to try out the Hisense Chromebook more extensively, and while there’s not much of note in the hardware, it did provide an opportunity to see how the Rockchip processor holds up — and my first impression is that it was pretty solid. I threw Slack, Google Music, and a whole host of more standard Chrome tabs at it without any noticeable slowdowns. It was certainly an unscientific test, but one that left me hoping that using the Flip (with its significantly nicer display and design) could be a pretty solid experience. The Hisense Chromebook is available for pre-order today from Walmart while the Haier Chromebook 11 is available on Amazon; they'll be on Google's new hardware store soon as well. Haier is actually offering two models -- the standard Chromebook 11 as well as the Haier 11E, specifically for the education market. It's more durable, has a spill-proof keyboard, a removable, user-replaceable battery, and includes a strange little handle built right into the body, as well. The education model is only being sold through institutional channels, but both Haier and Hisense's new Chromebooks are available for pre-order now.",0.6438650919421443,0.35613490805785575,0.18894242988881896,1160,4.8275862068965516,527,5.9981024667931688,0,2,"Google, Tech, Hands-on",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The New Scientist points out that all of the top 10 largest known primes are Mersennes uncovered by GIMPS. So far, the world’s number crunchers have only turned up 48 Mersenne primes in all, although mathematicians conjecture that there might be an infinite number of them. In other words, there’s still a lot more searching to do. And that searching gets more and more time-consuming the further out we search. The check to ensure that Cooper’s prime was, in fact, not divisible by any rogue factors took 39 days of continuous work from one of the campus computers.",0.5566864443526032,0.44331355564739683,0.8256456373841164,246,4.7764227642276422,161,5.2732919254658386,0,0,Science,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Unlike projects that focus on molding existing materials like chocolate, Fab@Home uses gel-like substances that can be combined with other materials (including artificial flavoring) to mimic the taste and mouthfeel of many different foods. While the flexibility and precision of 3D printing could make it a hit in Earth-bound molecular gastronomy, the ability to make small, varied portions of food is particularly valuable for astronauts. Currently, space voyages pack rotating packets of different meal types, but with a 3D printer, those could be swapped for base materials that would then be flavored and printed. Unfortunately, Fab@Home will also have to find a way to extrude the many ingredients that can go into a good meal, all while dealing with different temperatures and textures.

Archaeologists at the University of Leicester announced today that skeletal remains discovered last year are indeed those of King Richard III. Led by Richard Buckley, the researchers arrived at their conclusion after conducting extensive DNA tests over the past year, using samples from the late king's living descendants as benchmarks. In a press conference today, they announced that DNA testing proves Richard III's identity ""beyond reasonable doubt,"" putting an end to the 500-year mystery surrounding the king's death. The male remains were originally exhumed under a parking lot near where the king was believed to have been buried. The skeleton's curved spine and battle wounds were consistent with historical accounts of Richard III's 1485 death, as was the manner in which the skeleton was buried. Putting an end to 500 years of mystery Richard III sat on the English throne for two years between 1483 and 1485, when he was killed during battle at Bosworth. His reign marked the end of the War of Roses and is widely referred to as the final chapter in the medieval era, though his legacy has been most influenced — some would say unfairly — by William Shakespeare, whose historical play cast Richard as one of literature's most notorious, bloodthirsty villains. Researchers at Leicester used radio carbon dating to confirm that the individual in question died within the 15th century, aged between the late 20s and early 30s — details that align with Richard III's biography. The ten wounds inflicted on the skeleton were also determined to have been received before the man's death, negating any possibility of post-mortem tampering. Its slender build, signs of scoliosis, and battle-related trauma are all ""highly consistent"" with the circumstances of Richard's life and death, archaeologists said Monday.  The DNA analysis involved tests on four living male descendants, as well as an examination of existing documents on Richard III's family. Researchers also gathered evidence from descendants on Richard III's maternal side, allowing them to ""triangulate"" existing DNA samples with those of the unearthed skeleton. DNA evidence points to the throne Tests showed that the skeleton's DNA matched samples taken from Michael Ibsen, a Canadian-born carpenter and 17th generation descendent of the king's sister, and another anonymous descendant — providing proof ""beyond reasonable doubt"" that the remains are in fact King Richard III's. His skeleton will now be re-interred at Leicester Cathedral, near the Greyfriars site where it was first discovered. The cathedral will also be home to a new monument and tourist center erected in celebration of Richard III, which will be opened in conjunction with the monarch's re-interment.

Previous studies have suggested that both humans and rats have the ability to locate smells using differing sensory information from both nostrils, but none have conclusively proven the phenomena. Neurobiologist Kenneth Catania placed blind, eastern American moles in a chamber with 15 food wells arranged in a half-circle. The moles had to sniff their way to a piece of earthworm located in one of the wells. However, when researchers blocked a mole's right nostril, the animal veered to the left of its intended destination; the mole erred too far to the right when its left nostril was blocked. While an impaired sense of smell didn't stop the moles from locating the earthworm, it did significantly impact their performance. As you can see in this video (direct download), the closer the moles get to the smell's source, the farther they drift in the wrong direction. Finally, researchers used tubes to completely switch the inputs from the moles' left and right nostrils.

After nearly four hours of deliberation, the jury found Ulbricht guilty on all seven counts, including charges of narcotics conspiracy, money laundering conspiracy, and engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise. The Silk Road offered a platform for quasi-anonymous transactions, shielded by Tor's anonymity network and the transaction-masking properties of Bitcoin, and hosted more than $100 million in drug transactions before it was shut down by law enforcement in October of 2013. Over the past three weeks, the prosecution rolled out a wealth of evidence that Ross Ulbricht was the Dread Pirate Roberts, the pseudonymous leader of the Silk Road, and had facilitated and profited from millions of dollars worth of drug transactions during his time running the site. Ulbricht's personal journals were entered into evidence, many of which referred to his actions running the site. One friend testified that Ulbricht had asked him for technical advice, explaining that he was working on a ""website where people can buy drugs."" The prosecution also revealed digital evidence that linked Ulbricht to the Dread Pirate Roberts, including a PGP key used to sign Dread Pirate Roberts' emails, which was found on Ulbricht's laptop. ""[The evidence] is overwhelming,"" said prosecutor Serrin Turner during his closing statement. ""And to a significant extent it's undisputed."" The FBI traced $13 million from the Silk Road to Ulbricht's bitcoin wallet The ledger properties of Bitcoin also helped the prosecution make its case. FBI agents found Ulbricht's bitcoin wallet when they seized his laptop, uncovering millions of dollars that Ulbricht had unfettered access to. Ulbricht hadn't bothered to run his transactions through a laundering system, so Bitcoin's public ledger made it easy to identify any accounts his wallet had received money from. All of the transactions on Silk Road took place in bitcoin, so they are all present in Bitcoin's public ledger in some form, and law enforcement agents have been busy chasing down those leads in the months since Ulbricht's arrest. Testifying before the court, former FBI agent Ilhwan Yum traced more than $13 million in direct transactions from the Silk Road to Ulbricht's wallet, making a strong case that Ulbricht had been profiting from the site and, by extension, a number of illegal drug transactions. Ulbricht's defense had a hard time countering the onslaught of evidence. The team admitted at the outset that Ulbricht had been involved in the creation of the Silk Road, but claimed he had handed the site off to someone else early in development. That theory got a big break in the early days of the trial, when Homeland Security agent Jared Der-Yeghiayan admitted he had initially suspected Mt. Gox founder Mark Karpeles was behind the Silk Road. But the bulk of Der-Yeghiayan's testimony ended up being barred by the court as either hearsay or immaterial speculation, effectively neutering the defense's line of argument. Two other technical witnesses called by the defense were barred from testifying for procedural reasons, and Ulbricht subsequently declined to testify himself. That left the defense with few ways to make its case. Neither Bellovin nor Antonopoulos will be allowed to testify. Defense's case is gutted five different ways. #SilkRoadTrial  The Silk Road was once seen as a prototype for the idea of truly anonymous commerce, enabled by technological developments like Tor and Bitcoin, but today's verdict seems to have left that idea in tatters. Blake Benthall, Ulbricht's alleged successor as the Dread Pirate Roberts and proprietor of the Silk Road 2, is currently facing similar charges from the same district attorney, and one of the Silk Road 2's administrators was charged while the Ulbricht trial was still being argued. There are plenty of other dark web drug markets still in existence, but so far no one has stepped forward to claim the Silk Road mantle in the wake of the two arrests. Ulbricht's sentencing has been scheduled for May 15th.",0.3679184500444566,0.6320815499555434,0.8700837742391806,671,5.2354694485842028,367,6.26158038147139,0,0,"Culture, Web",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Anthem says medical and financial information does not appear to have been stolen The breach is the latest in a lengthy string of high-profile hacks targeted at big corporations. Experian, eBay, Home Depot, and Adobe are among the companies who have lost millions of customer records to hackers. The government's own insurance portal, Healthcare.gov, was also subject to a cyberattack last year in which no personal data was stolen. Anthem only discovered its breach last week when a systems administrator caught a database query being run under his identification without his knowledge. Federal law gives insurance companies 60 days to report cyberattacks after their discovery, but Anthem made its attack public quickly, a move in contrast to other companies such as Target, who waited until their investigations were nearing completion before informing customers that their data was in the hands of hackers.",0.32446357615803134,0.6755364238419687,0.8853356789122467,326,5.3190184049079754,201,6.0845771144278604,0,0,"Culture, Web",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The reasons for this shift are two fold: Smartphone penetration in Japan has boomed from 28 percent last year to 42 percent in 2013, putting it apace the States' 44 percent. That led to an incredible increase in apps being sold, and games apps are leading the way by a wide margin. App Annie lists game publishers like GungHo Online and Sega as driving sales. In addition, Google Play sales skyrocketed in the country — far more than any other place in the world — putting it on equal footing as App Store sales.

As BBC News reports, the legislation was passed in the Senate late Tuesday after nearly 12 hours of debate. Uruguay's lower house passed the bill earlier this year, and President José Mujica — an outspoken supporter of the legislation — is expected to sign it into law. Under the law, Uruguayans over the age of 18 will be able to purchase up to 40 grams (1.4 ounces) of marijuana per month, while licensed growers will be limited to six plants per household. It's not clear when the law will go into force, though the country's drug control agency has until April to draft a comprehensive plan to regulate the industry. Growers, sellers, and buyers will have to be registered and licensed, while public health officials have already launched a campaign to raise awareness about the drug's side effects and potential dangers. ""This is not liberalization of marijuana."" Mujica and his supporters have touted the legislation as a common-sense approach to drug reform, arguing that a tightly controlled drug market would be a more effective means of deterring cartel activities. But the initiative has faced strong opposition in Uruguay; it passed on Tuesday by a tight vote of 16 to 13 and is opposed by two-thirds of Uruguayans, according to a recent opinion poll. Speaking to BBC News, opposition member Alfredo Solari described the measure as a ""social engineering experiment"" that ""respects none of the ethic safeguards of experimentation on human beings."" Yet the law's passage was greeted by cheers from the hundreds of people who gathered outside the Congress in Montevideo yesterday, with Senator Constanza Moreira describing it as ""an historic day"" and predicting that other Latin American countries will follow Uruguay's lead.

(Flickr / NATO-Russia Council) Russian President Vladimir Putin tightened his grip over state media this week after dissolving one of Russia's most globally respected news outlets, replacing it with what many fear may be a propaganda mouthpiece for the Kremlin. In a decree issued Monday, Putin abruptly liquidated the prominent news agency RIA Novosti, merging it with radio service Voice of Russia to create a new media conglomerate called Rossia Segodnya, or Russia Today. Like its predecessors, the new company will be state-owned, and will be separate from the Russia Today television station, now known as RT. Yet aside from the company’s executive director — a TV presenter and Putin loyalist known for his anti-gay rhetoric and conspiracy theories — details on its scope and structure remain unclear. RIA Novosti's coverage is widely seen as balanced and neutral  despite the agency's ties to the Kremlin, but the conglomerate announced this week appears to be more slanted in nature. According to government officials, the move aims to both cut costs and strengthen the image of Russia abroad. ""Russia has its own independent politics and strongly defends its national interests."" ""Russia has its own independent politics and strongly defends its national interests: it’s difficult to explain this to the world but we can do this, and we must do this,"" Sergei Ivanov, Putin’s presidential chief of staff, told reporters on Monday. ""We must tell the truth, make it accessible to the most people possible and use modern language and the best available technologies in doing so."" Others see the move as a sign of Russia's growing encroachment on the media, raising concerns that Putin may look to exert greater control going forward. ""The move is the latest in a series of shifts in Russia's news landscape which appear to point towards a tightening of state control in the already heavily regulated media sector,"" RIA Novosti said in an English-language article on its own dissolution.  The RIA Novosti newsroom at its headquarters in Moscow. (Jürg Vollmer / Wikimedia Commons) Created in 1941 as the Soviet Information Bureau, RIA Novosti is one of Russia’s three major news agencies, together with the state-owned Itar-Tass and the privately owned Interfax. According to the company, RIA Novosti currently has reporters in 45 countries across the globe, providing news in 14 languages, and it has a large international readership. The move comes at a time of heightened political tensions for Putin, who is believed to have pressured neighboring Ukraine into rejecting a deal that would have strengthened its economic and political ties with the European Union. The decision to reject the deal has sparked widespread protests in Ukraine, with pro-EU demonstrators calling for the resignation of President Viktor Yanukovych. ""Putin has been excessively worried about mass protests."" It's not clear whether the Ukraine protests directly spurred Putin to liquidate RIA Novosti, though the timing and abrupt nature of the move has led many to speculate that the Kremlin may be looking to take greater control over how the protests and other sensitive issues are covered in the press. This week's announcement came just two days after Putin held private talks with Yanukovychh over a stronger ""strategic partnership"" between Russia and its former Soviet republic. It also took journalists and even some officials by surprise, including executives at both RIA Novosti and Voice of Russia. Dmitry Gorenburg, a senior analyst and Russia expert at the nonprofit think tank CNA, says it’s unlikely that the new agency will take form soon enough to wield significant influence over the Ukraine protests — ""RIA Novosti isn’t disappearing overnight"" — though he acknowledges that the timing is curious. ""There don't seem to be any signals that there was preparation [ahead of the decision] so that implies to me that it was decided fairly expeditiously,"" says Gorenburg. ""And we know that Putin has been excessively worried about mass protests being the main danger to his regime’s long-term survival."" ""The deal seems very simple: we pay you a good salary but you don't cross the red lines set by us."" Alexander Gabuev, deputy editor-in-chief at Moscow-based Kommersant-Vlast, a political weekly, says control over the Russian media has increased in recent years, pointing to a string of recent acquisitions by government-run companies. Last month, the media subsidiary of state-owned energy giant Gazprom acquired Profmedia, adding a slew of TV networks, radio stations, and film distribution companies to its growing portfolio. These deals have allowed media companies to offer handsome salaries to top journalists, though Gabuev says they often come with strings attached. ""The deal seems very simple: we pay you a good salary but you don't cross the red lines set by us,"" Gabuev said in an email. Unlike TV news networks, which remain under tight government control, RIA Novosti has not hesitated to report on politically sensitive issues, including the massive national protests that erupted in 2011 amid allegations of widespread election fraud. The demonstrations sent shockwaves across the Kremlin, prompting Putin to spread conspiracy theories involving Western leaders and media outlets. Such anti-Western rhetoric has remained a cornerstone of Putin’s third presidential term, as the pugnacious leader looks to shore up support among his conservative base. On the global stage, he’s been a strong supporter of embattled Syrian President Bashar al-Assad — standing in opposition to the US — while at home, he’s endorsed controversial anti-gay laws that have prompted calls for a boycott on the 2014 Winter Olympic Games in the Russian city of Sochi. (RIA Novosti, incidentally, was one of the Olympic Games' official sponsors.)   Dmitry Kiselyov, executive director of Russia's new conglomerate, made headlines last year for his incendiary on-air comments about gays. It remains unclear whether Russia Today’s coverage will echo Putin’s conservative stance, though the appointment of Dmitry Kiselyov as executive director suggests that it will. A popular news anchor for the domestic TV station Rossiya 1 TV, Kiseylov made headlines last year for declaring, on air, that gays should not be allowed to donate blood or sperm, and that their hearts should be burned and buried rather than donated for transplants. More recently, he’s spoken out against the Ukraine protests, claiming that they’re being fueled by the US and European governments. A decade earlier, Kiseylov worked as an anchor on a pro-government news station in Ukraine, where he publicly excoriated the 2004 protests against rigged elections. The dissolution of RIA Novosti won’t leave readers entirely in the dark; Gorenburg notes that there are still several reliable online news sources and daily newspapers for both domestic and international audiences. But few can match the breadth and clout of RIA Novosti's reporting, and the true impact of its absence may not be felt for years to come. ""I think one of the biggest domestic impacts will be in terms of training journalists,"" Gorenburg says. ""It's a huge organization, and a lot of people that went on to make names for themselves started out at RIA Novosti or were there at some point.""   He adds that if the restructuring of RIA Novosti proves as transformative as many fear, ""that's going to have an impact on the quality of journalism going forward.""",0.8911948394933187,0.10880516050668132,0.8597267283899832,1227,5.2966585167074163,643,6.6205287713841372,0,0,"Policy & Law, US & World, Report",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

The... Today, Wikileaks published a database of all of the data leaked from Sony Pictures in last year's hack, comprising 173,132 emails and 30,287 separate documents.

""This archive shows the inner workings of an influential multinational corporation,"" WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange said in a statement. ""It is newsworthy and at the... Amy Pascal spoke publicly yesterday for the first time since stepping down as the chief of Sony Pictures, Recode reports. At the Women in the World conference in San Francisco, Pascal talked openly, if vaguely, about the Sony hacks, pay inequality, and needy Hollywood stars.  Sony was meant to announce its third quarter earnings today, but since the catastrophic cyberattack directed at Sony Pictures took out much of its accounting equipment, the company is only able to issue approximate guidance for now. And there’s at least some good news: the company estimates it made a net profit of ¥89 billion ($756 million) between October and December, up 238 percent from a year earlier. Operating profit is forecast at ¥178.3 billion ($1.51 billion), and revenue is expected... Sony has announced that it's applying for an extension of the deadline to submit its third-quarter securities report ""due to the amount of destruction and disruption that occurred"" following the massive cyberattack directed against its movie division.

It was only a matter of weeks ago when Sony Pictures Entertainment sheepishly admitted it had no plans to release The Interview after suffering a massive data breach — reportedly at the hands of North Korea.

The Interview's haphazard release may have worked better than Sony planned. CNN's Brian Stelter is reporting that the film was rented or purchased 4.3 million times, adding up to roughly $31 million from online sales alone. The film also grossed roughly $5 million in theaters after its run was drastically scaled back in the face of terror threats. That adds up to an impressive total for a film that many thought might not be released at all. North Korea has accused the US of ""groundlessly stirring up bad blood"" towards the country after imposing sanctions in response to the alleged hack on Sony Pictures. A spokesperson for North Korea’s Foreign Ministry denied that the country had been involved in the cyberattack on the movie studio and said that Washington’s refusal to participate in a joint investigation to find the real culprits revealed its ""guilty conscience.""

If you're looking to see the movie with family on Christmas day — or see the movie while the rest of the family watches Annie — here's a list of every theater that's confirmed to be showing T... Now that Sony Pictures has allowed The Interview to premiere on Christmas Day — in select theaters, at least — we've heard nothing from exuberance at everyone involved in this story, from Seth Rogen and James Franco to Sony's unofficial head of distribution (and US President) Barack Obama. The Interview is making it out for Christmas. After a week of drama surrounding hacking, threats, and Presidential disses, Sony has decided to give The Interview a limited theatrical release on December 25th. ""We have never given up on releasing The Interview, and we're excited our movie will be in a number of theaters on Christmas Day,"" Michael Lynton, CEO of Sony Entertainment, says in a statement. ""At the same time, we are continuing our efforts to secure more platforms and more theaters... Sony Pictures Entertainment has already tried threatening members of the media with legal action in a bid to stem the spread of information stolen from its servers by hacker group Guardians of Peace last month. Now it's also decided to try targeting the means of disseminating that information — Motherboard reports the company has promised to sue Twitter unless it bans accounts that are linking to the leaks. The threat was made in a letter sent by Sony lawyer David Boies to VIjaya Gadde,... This morning brought some alarming news. Just two days after President Obama promised a proportionate response to the North Korean attack on Sony, the country mysteriously disappeared from the internet and stayed offline for the next 10 hours. Given the timing, the question was inevitable: was this the retaliation Obama had promised? But while it's tempting to connect the two, early reports suggest it's very unlikely that the downtime was the work of a government actor. Sony Pictures has been blaming theater chains for its decision to cancel the release of The Interview, but US independent movie theaters are making that a difficult argument to sell. North Korea is having serious connectivity issues this morning, North Korea Tech reports. The country has extremely limited web infrastructure to begin with, but reports from Dyn indicate the country's infrastructure has suffered a series of major outages over the past 24 hours. As a result, anyone at a North Korean IP would have found it nearly impossible to connect to the web. ""I haven’t seen such a steady beat of routing instability and outages in KP before,"" said Doug Madory, director of... Sometimes, a movie's notoriety can transcend its actual content and make it a culturally significant milestone all by its lonesome. No movie this year (or maybe even this decade) has been as notorious as Seth Rogen's The Interview, which was pulled from US movie theaters in response to threats of terrorist attacks if it were ever released. An outspoken backlash against the decision has risen up in the United States and elsewhere, which today sees itself expressed through the fan scores of... China has given its first hint of its stance on the Sony Pictures hack and The Interview, and Americans will likely be displeased. An editorial in The Global Times, a paper run by the state's Communist Party, largely sides with North Korea and strongly criticizes The Interview. The editorial reads, in part, that ""any civilized world will oppose hacker attacks or terror threats. But a movie like The Interview, which makes fun of the leader of an enemy of the US, is nothing to be proud of for... Of course SNL had to get a few digs in at the Sony hacks this week, and Mike Myers returned as Dr. Evil himself to do the digging. During the show's cold open, the old Austin Powers villain said that Sony, North Korea, and the GOP were all giving evil organizations a bad name. And over The Interview, of all things. ""Look, I saw The Interview,"" he said, addressing Sony (which apparently hasn't had a hit since the Walkman). ""It was charming. But if you really want to put a bomb in a theater,... President Obama has stopped short of characterizing the Sony Pictures hack as an act of war by North Korea. In an interview with CNN's Candy Crowley that aired early Sunday, the president described the attack as a ""very costly, very expensive"" act of cybervandalism. However, he did reiterate that the US will respond proportionally to the attack, and is currently reviewing whether or not to put the communist country back on our list state sponsors of terrorism. ""We’re going to review those... While the US is dismissive of North Korea's proposed ""joint investigation"" into the Sony hack, according to a New York Times report, the Obama administration has reached out to China for help in ""blocking North Korea's ability to launch cyberattacks."" US officials today stood firmly by the FBI's conclusion that North Korea is responsible for the crippling cyber attack on Sony Pictures that ultimately led to the cancellation of The Interview. After North Korea vehemently denied those accusations earlier on Saturday, White House National Security Council spokesperson Mark Stroh said in a statement, ""As the FBI made clear, we are confident the North Korean government is responsible for this destructive attack. We stand by this conclusion."" He... North Korea is continuing to deny any involvement with the devastating cyber attack on Sony Pictures. But the entire affair just got even stranger: foreign ministry officials have announced through the government's state-run news agency that ""we propose a joint investigation with [the US] into this incident."" The government then warned that there will be ""grave consequences"" if the US continues its ""groundless slander"" of North Korea and rejects its proposal of a joint investigation.... Despite making overtures that it has not ""caved,"" or ""backed down,"" in the face of hacker threats, Sony Pictures appears to have been quietly pulling each and every online promotion for its movie, The Interview. As of Friday evening, the film's website, Facebook page, Twitter account, Instagram, Tumblr, and YouTube channel (plus trailers from Sony Pictures' channel) have all disappeared without so much as a note that suggests they'd be back. A number of people — The Verge included — have called on Sony to release The Interview online, be it streaming à la Netflix / Hulu or for sale on a service like iTunes / Google Play. In an interview with CNN's Fareed Zakaria (which will air in its entirety tonight), Sony Pictures CEO Michael Lynton says that while Sony ""has every desire"" to release the film, online isn't the immediate option. The network has been teasing the interview all day — here's the relevant snippet: ""There are a... If you ask President Obama, Sony made a ""mistake"" by canceling The Interview's release — but that doesn't mean the movie is gone for good. CNN has just run a quick teaser of Fareed Zakaria's interview with Sony Pictures CEO Lynton (emphasis ours): ""When it came to the crucial moment when the threat came out from what was called the [Guardians of Peace] at the time threatening audiences who would go to movie theaters the movie theater came to us one by one over a very short period of time... President Obama says that the United States will respond to North Korea over its cyberattack on Sony Pictures. He declined to say what that response will be, saying only that it will be ""proportional."" Obama said that a number of options are being worked up by his staff and that he will choose what to do based on what he feels is ""appropriate to the nature of this crime.""  President Obama is about to begin a press conference where he is expected to discuss North Korea's cyberattack on Sony Pictures. It is not clear what, if any, actions the United States will take in response, but the White House press secretary already began setting low expectations yesterday, noting that the hackers may be hoping for a certain reaction. The Federal Bureau of Investigation said earlier today that... On the heels of today's FBI statement officially naming North Korea as responsible for the hack on Sony Pictures, Homeland Security chief Jeh Johnson has put out a statement denouncing the attack and emphasizing his department's cybersecurity efforts. ""The cyber attack against Sony Pictures Entertainment was not just an attack against a company and its employees,"" Johnson said in the statement. ""It was also an attack on our freedom of expression and way of life."" The release of The Interview,... The Federal Bureau of Investigation says that North Korea is behind the cyberattack on Sony last month that's led to the release of stolen emails and social security numbers and the cancellation of The Interview. The FBI formally identified North Korea's government as culprit in the hack this morning, following anonymous reports from US officials Wednesday evening. North Korea has been widely suspected to be behind these attacks for weeks.  The hackers who attacked Sony Pictures are making more demands of the studio following their success in scrapping the release of The Interview, according to CNN. CNN reports that top Sony executives received an email from the hacking group last night with a message saying that it would withhold further data, but only if the studio never let anyone see The Interview or pretty much any sign that The Interview ever existed.  The Federal Bureau of Investigation will say later today that North Korea was behind the cyberattack on Sony, according to Reuters and CBS. Reuters reports that investigators will also say there may also be a link to China in the hack, with Chinese servers potentially being involved. It appears to be unknown if this link is because the hack was accomplished in collaboration with China or if Chinese servers were being used to hide the source of the attack. North Korea has been widely seen as... In the midst of canceling The Interview's December 25th release, it looks like Sony forgot to unschedule a YouTube promo video. A new 30-spot just popped up on Sony Pictures Entertainment's YouTube channel with the prescient description, ""Only one movie has the whole world talking. In Rogen and Franco we trust."" (In the clip itself the names are reversed: ""In Franco and Rogen We Trust."") Release date? Christmas Day. Oops. I think it's safe to say this is an accident and not a bizarre way to... Just a day after Sony decided to cancel the debut of the embattled comedy The Interview, Paramount Pictures is pulling Team America: World Police from release. The Alamo Drafthouse, which had scheduled Team America as a fill-in for the Seth Rogen comedy after yesterday's development, confirmed that its December 27th screening had been canceled, as did Cleveland Cinemas, which had booked the film for a 2015 midnight screening way back in October.  The Interview screenwriter Dan Sterling talks about the origins of the premise. It's a macabre footnote to a troubling few weeks, and it's a ""what if"" that shouldn't matter. A lot's happened with Sony, The Interview, and North Korea over the last three weeks, and it's been easy to get lost. So we've put together a quick refresher on all the news that's come out since the attacks began. It's been one of the strangest and most befuddling stories of the year, but we've answered the biggest questions below. On November 24th, the computers at Sony Pictures Entertainment abruptly stopped working, blasting a red skeleton image onto every monitor... After weeks of speculation, US officials have told news outlets that North Korea was involved in November's devastating Sony hack. Especially because the group threatened violence if Sony released its North Korea-focused comedy The Interview, this could turn the issue from a major security problem to an international incident, and American politicians have begun formulating their responses — whether that's simple condemnation or calls for new cybersecurity bills. The White House hasn't said... US officials are now pointing the finger at North Korea for the hacks against Sony Pictures, multiple reports claim. Citing government intelligence officials, The New York Times says that the country was ""centrally involved"" in the attack that led to troves of internal Sony Pictures documents being leaked, including plans for future studio projects. Citing unnamed officials, CNBC adds that the hacks came from outside the country, though were orchestrated by North Korea. The US is expected to... Sony is canceling The Interview's planned theatrical release in response to all major US theater chains deciding not to show the film after attacks were threatened. ""In light of the decision by the majority of our exhibitors not to show the film The Interview, we have decided not to move forward with the planned December 25 theatrical release,"" Sony says in a statement, reprinted by Variety. ""We respect and understand our partners’ decision and, of course, completely share their paramount... Deadline is reporting that New Regency has decided to cancel a ""paranoid thriller"" set in North Korea that was being developed by Gore Verbinski (Pirates of the Caribbean) and set to star Steve Carell. One of the least expected companies to take collateral damage in the epic Sony Pictures hack has been Snapchat. CEO Evan Spiegel regularly trades emails with Sony Pictures CEO Michael Lynton, who sits on Snapchat's board, and the revelations from the pair's emails have been spilling out all week. Among them: the company secretly bought a company that makes a Google Glass-like product; it's actively pursuing plans to insert music into the app; and the company turned down a bigger offer from... The biggest movie theater chains in the United States have cancelled all current plans to show The Interview following threats to attack screenings of the film, according to The Hollywood Reporter. The three largest chains in the US — AMC, Regal, and Cinemark — are reported to have called off screenings for the movie, as has Cineplex, the largest chain in Canada. While Sony has not officially cancelled release of The Interview, its availability only at small theater chains means that it will... With Seth Rogen and James Franco canceling promotional appearances and theaters choosing to not screen the film at all, it's clear that The Interview is in trouble. However, there's one move Sony Pictures can make to salvage the film's chances... Admins on Reddit have started banning users for sharing files on the site from the trove of Sony documents released by the hackers, saying that the act violates the website's terms of use regarding the posting of personal data. The social news site has also deleted posts and banned one particular subreddit — SonyGOP — where the files were not only being discussed, but also linked to and hosted. Attempting to visit that specific subreddit currently only returns information stating ""this... The Interview director and co-star Seth Rogen has said that despite the controversial subject of his upcoming assassination comedy, he believes that casting the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un as a villain is ""not an edgy position to take."" Rogen, speaking to The New York Times, said: ""He is bad. It’s controversial to him. But to everyone else, it’s fine. To their credit, [Sony] let us do it."" In addition to Sony asking for the Kim Jong-un death scene to be toned down (as revealed in leaked... The Interview, Seth Rogen's Kim Jong-un assassination comedy that may be at the center of the devastating Sony Pictures hack, is scheduled to hit theaters on Christmas Day, but at this point Sony may rather wish it not come out at all. Following another leak which contained terror threats against prospective viewers, studio executives are now telling theaters that they ""wouldn't object"" to any decision not to show the movie, according to The Wall Street Journal. Carmike Cinemas is first to... James Franco and Seth Rogen are canceling press appearances for The Interview following threats from the Sony hackers against theaters screening the film, according to BuzzFeed. No specific threat was made against either actor, but it's evident that the hackers are not happy with them, let alone anyone else associated with or even seeing the film. The movie is about and depicts the assassination of Kim Jong-un, and it's widely suspected that North Korea is involved in the attack on Sony. The... The Sony hackers are threatening an attack on people who go out to see The Interview, writing in a message that they ""recommend you to keep yourself distant"" from movie theaters and other screening locations. The hackers previously promised to deliver a ""Christmas gift,"" and while that originally sounded like another trove of leaked data, they are now implying that it may be an attack. ""Warning[.] We will clearly show it to you at the very time and places 'The Interview' be shown, including... A group of former and current Sony Pictures employees are suing the company for failing to protect their data, according to a complaint filed today in California District Court. (A second suit has also been filed according to The Hollywood Reporter, alleging that the choice to name North Korea put employees in danger.) The group is led by a former employee named Michael Corona, who worked for Sony between 2004 and 2007, and is currently spending $700 a year for identity theft protection. Sony... This just might be the (exploding) face that launched a thousand hacks: one of the many variants of Kim Jong-un’s death scene from Sony’s notorious and possibly colossal-hack-causing movie The Interview. First discovered by Gawker, the clip has been leaked as part of the ongoing attack against the Japanese company; a hack that many have speculated was triggered by North Korean anger at the portrayal of their ""beloved leader."" Although North Korean officials have denied any involvement in the... Sony Pictures' legal team has begun its campaign to beat back media coverage of the studio's hack, and today the studio's leadership tried to address internal fears during a company-wide town hall meeting. As the Sony email leaks drag on, the company has brought on high-powered attorney David Boies to warn media outlets to delete any leaked information, or else it will ""have no choice but to hold you responsible."" Today, most observers would tell you the piracy fight has reached a standstill. It's easy to take down infringing links from platforms like Google and YouTube, and a string of international prosecutions has turned file-sharing sites like The Pirate Bay and Isohunt into an endangered species. At the same time, more draconian measures that would wipe the sites off the internet entirely have largely failed within the US after a string of legislative defeats that culminated in 2011's SOPA and... A message apparently from the people behind last month's Sony Pictures hack is offering to remove employees' information from upcoming data dumps. The post, signed GOP or Guardians of Peace, includes links to new files, but it also says that hackers are preparing a Christmas gift of ""more interesting"" data that will ""put Sony Pictures into the worst state."" Today on The Verge we published a story about a major operation by the MPAA to broadly and significantly impact the distribution of information, which would impact how free speech works on the internet. We obtained this information from a massive hack whose prime objective was to punish a US studio for exercising its free speech rights. The irony is not lost on us. The Sony leak is a story that lands at the intersection of tech, business, and entertainment; in other words, right in The Verge'... What is ""Goliath"" and why are Hollywood’s most powerful lawyers working to kill it? In dozens of recently leaked emails from the Sony hack, lawyers from the MPAA and six major studios talk about ""Goliath"" as their most powerful and politically relevant adversary in the fight against online piracy. They speak of ""the problems created by Goliath,"" and worry ""what Goliath could do if it went on the attack."" Together they mount a multi-year effort to ""respond to / rebut Goliath’s public advocacy""... New Sony leaks reveal what David Fincher though about Aaron Sorkin's Steve Jobs script — and how the movie will only have four locations. Sony Pictures, hit by a cyberattack that allowed hackers to steal sensitive data that includes financial documents, email transcripts, unreleased movies, and celebrity social security numbers, has reportedly borrowed a leaf from the hackers' books as it has begun to try to control the spread of its stolen documents. Recode reports that locations sharing the data have become the target of attacks set in motion by Sony itself. According to two sources familiar with the matter, the company is... A lot of very strange news has already come out of the Sony Pictures hack, but this might be the strangest. According to The Wall Street Journal, emails have been found in the leaked cache of documents that reveal the movie studio is planning to make a crossover movie involving the Men in Black and Jump Street franchises for a 2016 or 2017 release. While the movie won't feature Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones, Jump Street actors Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum are expected to star. One of the... Spoiler warning: this article contains information that might reveal plot points for The Interview. Hackers released emails from Sony this week, which revealed Sony CEO Kazuo Hirai's role in changing the ending of The Interview, which features North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un dying horrifically. Bloomberg writes that Hirai gave input on the changes and made it a point to keep Kim's exploding face from appearing on international screens. He was responsible for providing the ultimate go-ahead... Emails leaked in the massive hack of Sony Pictures have revealed fractious debates behind the production of Aaron Sorkin's Steve Jobs movie. Much of the drama, collated by Gawker, is between producer Scott Rudin and Sony Pictures chairman Amy Pascal (both pictured above), who clash heads over Angelina Jolie and David Fincher. Jolie apparently wanted the Social Network director for her own Cleopatra project, but was upset with Sony for putting him on Steve Jobs.  The group responsible for the catastrophic hack of Sony Pictures warned executives at the company three days before carrying out its attack, according to email evidence discovered by Mashable among the leaked material. This email was reportedly sent to CEO Michael Lynton and chairman Amy Pascal, among others: We've got great damage by Sony Pictures. The compensation for it, monetary compensation we want. Pay the damage, or Sony Pictures will be bombarded as a whole. You know us very... The monumental hack of seemingly every document ever produced at Sony Pictures has yielded a fresh trove of mildly amusing information: the aliases used by celebrities when they are trying to avoid being detected. Fusion has a full list of the names, along with some explanations of how they came to be. It's mostly a snooze, but points to Rob Schneider, whose alias of ""Nazzo Good"" doubles when spoken aloud as a review of his movies; and to Jessica Alba, who apparently checks into hotels under... A new message has been posted on GitHub, purporting to be from the Sony hackers and offering a fresh batch of sensitive corporate data. The message threatens further consequences if the studio continues with its release of ""the movie of terrorism,"" believed to refer to The Interview, an upcoming comedy starring Seth Rogen and James Franco, which depicts the assassination of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. It's the most explicit reference to the film that the attackers have made so far,... Over the weekend, we got two new reasons to think North Korea was behind the Sony attack — one from security researchers and one from the attackers themselves. But even as the evidence piles up, it’s seeming more and more likely that that attackers will get away clean. The Sony Pictures hack has been devastating for the movie studio and has led to the release of tens of thousands of sensitive documents, but you can always count on James Franco and Seth Rogen to get a few laughs out of any situation. The two actors hosted Saturday Night Live this week and took the opportunity to get out ahead of the leaks by 'fessing up to some embarrassing details of their private lives before they're inevitably leaked across the web. You won't believe what Seth and James... North Korea is applauding the devastating hack on Sony Pictures, though it is not taking responsibility for the attacks. According to The New York Times, a spokesperson quoted by the North Korean Central News Agency said that the country was not involved in the hack and did not know why Sony was singled out as a target. However, he suggested that it ""might be a righteous deed of the supporters and sympathizers"" of North Korea who are joining its efforts to ""put an end to US imperialism."" ""A... Variety is reporting that Sony Pictures employees have received a mass threat, purporting to be from the same digital attackers that took down the company systems last week. Sony says it has alerted law enforcement to the threat. A separate warning went out advising employees to turn off mobile devices, although it is unclear whether the threat was accompanied by a new attack. A week after it was brought to a standstill by a hacker group that may or may not have hailed from North Korea, things are getting even worse for Sony Pictures. The hackers that crippled the company's computer systems have now released a vast hoard of Sony Pictures' private documents onto the internet. An analysis of more than 33,000 documents showed that they displayed passwords to internal computers, credit cards, and social media accounts, as well as the Social Security numbers of 47,000... New evidence has emerged linking North Korea to the recent attacks on Sony, thanks to research conducted by the firm AlienVault. Using samples of the code released by the FBI, AlienVault's labs director Jaime Blasco was able to track down a copy of the malware that had fallen into one of the company's malware honeypots and analyze the software for clues. According to the program's compiler metadata, the programs and resources that compose the malware were compiled between Novermber 22nd and... On the Monday before Thanksgiving, Sony Pictures was attacked by North Korea. The studio is still holding off on its official announcement, but by now it seems clear that the attack came in retaliation for the upcoming film The Interview, a comedy about an attempt to kill North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.  North Korean officials had denounced the film as an act of war, and with the attack public, North Korean leaders have yet to deny the country is responsible. As Sony Pictures employees still struggle to get back online, new evidence is emerging that suggests North Korea may be behind the hack. The Wall Street Journal is reporting that researchers investigating the hack have found the malicious code to be almost exactly the same as the code used in a March 2013 attack on a series of South Korean banks and broadcasters, an attack widely believed to have been conducted by North Korea. Re/code had previously reported that Sony was investigating a... Sony Pictures is ""exploring the possibility that hackers working on behalf of North Korea, perhaps operating out of China."" Possibly related: Sony is releasing The Interview, a Seth Rogen comedy about assassinating Kim Jong-Un, later this year. The hackers who took down Sony Pictures' computer systems yesterday say that they are working for ""equality"" and suggest that their attack was assisted or carried out by Sony employees. In an email responding to inquiries from The Verge, a person identifying as one of the hackers writes, ""We Want equality [sic]. Sony doesn't. It's an upward battle."" The hackers' goals remain unclear, but they used the attack yesterday to specifically call out Sony Entertainment CEO Michael Lynton, referring... Today, employees across the Sony Pictures offices were greeted with a strange picture as they tried to login to their computers. Since this afternoon, computers at the company have been completely unresponsive, showing a glowering CGI skeleton, a series of URL addresses, and a threatening message from a hacker group that identifies itself as #GOP.

Lucas' modern vision of Star Wars — with a ronto in every marketplace, midichlorians in every Jedi's bloodstream, and a moody dad-ghost crashing every celebratory Ewok feast — has been the subject of much mockery. Already Abrams has suggested that he's departing from Lucas' approach to Star Wars, showing a predilection for practical effects and puppets where Lucas preferred squealing CGI slugmen and floppy-eared irritants, and focusing more on character study and development where Lucas' prequel trilogy focused on selling toys to children with rich parents. If, for some morbid reason, you do want to see what Lucas would've done with the Episode VII trailer, take a look at Michael Shanks' amended ""George Lucas Special Edition,"" featuring computer-generated dewbacks, extra TIE fighters, and a host of other extras the Star Wars creator might have added to make the movie ""closer to his original vision.""

Today, the dating app revealed details of a partnership it struck last year with TeleSign, a mobile security and fraud prevention company based in southern California. According to the two companies, TeleSign's two-step verification system has reduced the number of Tinder spambots by 90 percent since they partnered in early 2014. Today’s announcement comes on the heels of several high-profile Tinder exploits. Last week, The Verge reported on a California-based computer engineer who created a bot that matches unwitting straight men with one another. On Friday, we reported on a similar catfishing scheme far larger in scale — an international network of 20 dummy profiles that has implicated about 10,000 male users, according to the British hacker behind it. Other well-documented scams have aimed at promoting porn sites, mobile games, or spreading malware. ""The spam problem is ever-evolving."" Tinder’s partnership with TeleSign aims to identify and block spammers from the moment they sign up. TeleSign identifies numbers that have a higher risk of being Tinder bots by analyzing their historical data and usage patterns. It may then send text messages to these numbers at Tinder’s request, prompting users to enter a code to prove they’re human. It’s essentially a targeted version of the same two-step authentication process that has become common across many social networks. ""Ultimately, the mobile phone number has been the most effective way of preventing this type of spam,"" says Ryan Disraeli, vice president and co-founder of TeleSign, which counts Evernote and Salesforce among its clients. Red flags include numbers that are cheap or free to acquire, Disraeli adds, including VoIP numbers from services like Google Voice. Tinder has publicly acknowledged its spambot problem, and has previously vowed a crackdown. It has an internal system to flag suspicious new sign-ups, though as the recent catfishing schemes demonstrate, the measures still aren't bulletproof — even with TeleSign's help. Spambots dropped by 52 percent after Tinder Plus launch ""The spam problem is ever-evolving,"" Tinder CTO Ryan Ogle said in a telephone interview, adding that some scammers operate with legitimate phone numbers. ""It’s never something that you completely solve."" He described catfishing, in particular, as ""an odd activity that’s recently taken hold,"" noting that the company is developing new ways to ""completely eliminate this trend."" The landscape also appears to have changed following the launch of Tinder Plus, a premium (and somewhat controversial) upgrade that offers unlimited ""likes,"" among other features, in exchange for a monthly fee. In a recent blog post, Tinder said that spambots decreased by 52 percent within ten days of launching Tinder Plus. Ogle says the ""steady decline"" has continued, in part, because spammers ""aren’t able to perform as much activity"" on the app as they were before. Ogle says Tinder will continue to explore new counter-spam measures as bots become ever-more advanced, underscoring the importance of maintaining users’ trust. In 2013, a few months after Tinder launched, co-founder Sean Rad touted the app’s transparency as an advantage over its competitors, telling the Los Angeles Times ""it's harder to fake your profile because it is connected to your Facebook account."" Two years and untold pornbots later, Ogle says spam prevention is now ""priority number one.""",0.6238674381393734,0.3761325618606266,0.8883535242341397,563,5.5079928952042625,366,6.4344262295081966,0,0,"Apps, Tech",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

But that’s a distraction; the real story is that Samsung needed to learn that hardware prowess and software features are tools you use to build something great, not ends in themselves. Most Galaxy phones are uninspired compilations of spec lists. For the S6, Samsung to needed to find inspiration, and it did: in Apple.  The Galaxy S6 is what happens when Samsung doesn’t try to copy Apple’s phones, but instead finally tries to copy Apple’s product philosophy.  The first thing to know about the S6 is that it doesn’t feel much like other Samsung phones. Instead of a plastic or faux-leather back, it’s glass on the front and the back with metal around the rim. We’ve seen other phones do this, but none have done it so well. The Galaxy S6 looks great and feels even better. The edges are subtly textured from flat to curved in all the right spots. The seams between the glass and the metal are nigh-microscopic, and the whole thing just feels fantastic. It weighs just a hair more than an iPhone 6, and it’s slightly bigger as well. But I actually find it easier to hold and to reach the far corners because the glass is less likely to slip than the iPhone’s metal finish. It glides into a pocket and stays in my hand. If you wanted to go hunting for problems, you could find them. Maybe the Gorilla Glass 4 won’t hold up to drops or could be prone to scratching (neither has been the case for me so far). The camera bump on the back is an overly large wart. That’s about it, from a straight physical design perspective. And in both cases, I’m simply not worried about it. Then there’s the elephant in the room: it really does remind you of the iPhone. This isn’t a straight rip, of course. From the front, it’s the spitting image of the Galaxy S5. The back is glass, and the curves fit Samsung’s traditional Galaxy shape instead of iPhone’s rounded rectangle. But take a look at the bottom of each phone: You’ll find the same perfectly machined holes and ports in basically identical spots. Samsung also dropped the removable battery, the microSD storage expansion, and even the waterproofing, all in the name of design. The Galaxy S6 looks great and feels even better This comparison is the makings of an epic argument between partisans of both companies (and I’m sure you will get a taste of that if you read the comments below). But I really don’t care if Samsung copied any particular iPhone design element or not. What I care about is that it really does seem like Samsung finally got around to copying the most important thing: a fully conceived, well-executed design. It’s actually remarkable to see a Samsung device where design feels like it was a consideration from the start, not something applied only after the component list was compiled. Go ahead and have your battles about which is better, who copied who, and even whether it’s worth losing that traditional Samsung removable battery. While you’re doing that, I’ll be over here enjoying this elegant and refined device. If there’s any single feature of the iPhone you could say Samsung copied, it’s the fingerprint sensor. And thank god it did, because it’s actually useful as an unlocking mechanism now. The interface for setting it up looks exactly like Apple’s, with a fingerprint that slowly gets colored in as it learns. But you can use it from any angle simply by resting your finger on the home button, and though it’s not quite as fast or as accurate as the iPhone, it’s very close. But that’s where the comparisons stop, because the rest is all pure, unapologetically Samsung. The Galaxy S6 features a parade of specs, each one more audacious than the last. There’s the IR blaster, the heart rate monitor that doubles as a shutter button for selfies, the support for not one but two wireless charging standards, the insanely fast new processor, the 16-megapixel optically stabilized camera, and even a super loud speaker. But it all culminates in the display — and what a culmination it is. The Galaxy S6 has one of the finest screens I have ever seen on a phone. It’s a 5.1-inch Super AMOLED display with a completely unnecessary number of pixels, 2560 x 1440. Forget any gripes you may have heard about AMOLED screens in the past; they don’t apply here. By simply throwing a pixel density of 577 PPI and the processing power necessary to move light through them, Samsung has overcome any complaints with brute force. And also with better color awareness: whites are whiter, blacks are blacker, colors are vibrant without being oversaturated. At oblique angles, it’s not as accurate as the traditional LCD you’ll find on an iPhone, and it doesn’t sit quite as close to the surface of the glass. But when you’re looking straight on, everything is ridiculously sharp. There’s also a huge gamut of brightness, from eye-searing to safe to read in bed, and the auto-brightness is actually useful. As long as I’m talking about the screen, let’s talk about the Galaxy S6 Edge, whose distinguishing feature is a screen that curves around two sides. We’re not reviewing it separately because it is, for nearly all intents and purposes, the exact same phone as the regular S6. In fact, the only intent and purpose that really matters for the Edge is marketing: it’s just an incredibly cool-looking phone that’s sure to draw people into the store. It’s an example of Samsung’s engineering abilities and the kind of thing that will wow your friends at the bar for a minute or two. Unfortunately, it’s not much more than that. The S6 Edge has the same size screen as the regular S6, just with that slight curve. The effect is trippy when you slide an icon across it, and in some cases it’s just really nice to glide your thumb over it. But the tradeoff is that the sides of the phone are thinner and feel sharper. Samsung has added a few software tricks to go along with the curved screen. You can set a row of colored, favorite contacts that you can swipe to see. When one of those contacts calls you and your phone is face-down, the table lights up with the appropriate color. There’s a night clock that’s inexplicably limited to working for 12 hours a day. Lastly, there’s the ""Information stream,"" which will give you the time, notifications, weather, and a random Yahoo News headline. That last feature is super slow and buggy, and the gesture to bring it up is really hard to get right. The S6 Edge is pretty, but not worth the extra $100 Basically, the extra $100 you have to spend to get the Edge buys you a cool-looking phone with some very forgettable software features. I think the regular S6 is handsome enough on its own and feels better in the hand to boot. Between the two, it’s the one to get. There’s probably no greater source of complaints with Android phones than their cameras. Samsung has always managed to float above the sea of Android photographic disappointment, but never really soared. With the S6 and its optically stabilized, 16-megapixel sensor, it’s really starting to fly. In bright light, I’m hard pressed to find anything major to complain about. In low light, pictures tend to come out a little more yellow than I’d like, and it can be pretty aggressive in lightening things up too much. Yes, you see artifacting when you zoom in on the results, but not enough to bother me. And in some cases, I actually preferred the lighter images that Samsung put out to what I got with the iPhone 6 Plus. The truth, though, is that this is probably the closest any Android phone has ever come to the ""just shoot"" mentality I love about the iPhone. Especially with the real time HDR, I found myself trusting the Galaxy S6 to simply get it right instead of diving into the expert settings. I don’t know if I’ve ever just trusted an Android phone to get it right and been rewarded for it, but the S6 has been doing just that, consistently. After a few first-day lags and error messages (which may have been cleared up by a software update), I never ran into any notable slowdowns. In fact, this is probably the fastest Android phone I’ve ever used. It should be, with a 64-bit Octa-core processor and 3GB of RAM. Like it did with the screen, I think Samsung solved any slowdowns you might experience in Android with brute force. So much so that I often found that both versions of the S6 get warm, especially when using processor- or graphics-intensive apps. Those power-hungry apps also took a toll on battery life. In our web browsing battery test (which loops a web page once a minute), the Galaxy S6 held up well, achieving over nine hours of uptime. But in actual usage — especially when streaming YouTube or playing games — I got less than that, sometimes distressingly less. There were days that I made it to midnight and beyond before it conked out, and there were days where the battery saver mode kicked in as early as 6PM. That’s decidedly average at best, and worse than what I get with an iPhone 6. The Galaxy S6 has a 2,550 mAh battery, and the S6 Edge, oddly, rates 2,600 mAh. That’s smaller than the S5’s battery, yet it needs to power many more pixels — so I suppose it’s a testament to both Lollipop and Samsung’s processor that it lasts as long as it does. It also helps that Samsung is supporting both major wireless charging standards in one body and rapid charging via USB. That’s all nice, I suppose, but it’s small consolation when you’re away from a plug and running out of juice. On the software side, Samsung is continuing its long journey toward a genuinely clean and restrained design. But it’s doing so by taking all of the clutter and stuffing it into the closet. The crazy Samsung features are mostly still here, just buried and turned off by default. I’m fine with that: the result is a lot of nicer rooms to live in. Samsung has mostly deferred to Google’s Material Design sensibilities, which is a refreshing change of pace. I still wish that Samsung would use more restrained colors, though. There’s also a new theming option and store, but the stuff you’ll find there is the stuff of a bad LSD trip when it isn’t a blatant co-branding ploy with an action movie. Unfortunately, there’s still carrier-incentivized crapware apps to contend with. My review units come from T-Mobile, which meant that Lookout Security and T-Mobile carrier junk took up half my notifications until I managed to turn them off. Samsung's finally learning how to make better software Samsung’s apps like S Health are surprisingly decent, though, and I actually found myself using S Finder in the notification shade to quickly jump to arcane settings I couldn’t otherwise have located. Samsung still wants you to believe that it’s a good idea to use two apps at once on the same screen or to put one app in a tiny pop-over window. It’s mostly wrong about both of those ideas, but I guess it’s impressive that a phone can even pull it off in the first place. Honestly, my favorite new feature is double-pressing the home button to launch the camera. Sometime in the past year, the bar for what makes a good smartphone got raised. It has to look good, it has to have a great screen, it has to last all day, it has to have elegant software, and most of all it has to have a really good camera. Miss one of those marks, and you haven’t just failed, you’ve probably lost a customer for years. (Just ask HTC in six months.) But you can’t treat that list of ""has to's"" as a checklist. Design isn’t a checkbox, and it’s more than how a phone looks or feels. It’s the whole thing, integrated, so you almost can’t imagine it any other way. We’ve heard Apple espouse these maxims so much that they’ve passed beyond the realm of cliche into proverb. You can’t help but feel like they're just empty words, a glossy sheen to distract you from the incredibly complex and multivarious innards of the modern smartphone. Design isn’t a checkbox, and it’s more than how a phone looks or feels But design at this deeper level matters. And it’s something Samsung has chosen — or been forced — to contend with. The Galaxy S6 is the first time I’ve felt like Samsung might finally be grappling with the idea of what a smartphone ought to be on an ontological level. No, the Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge don’t fully tick off every single box in that checklist. But they’ve done something better: become phones that are more than the collection of their parts. Samsung finally copied the right thing: caring about design.",0.5139558459991731,0.4860441540008269,0.1640964529590122,2332,4.6813893653516292,986,6.0517241379310347,0,30,"Google, Tech, Review",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The update adds new theming options, more gesture controls, and a smart task creation tool. The theming options are pretty basic — there are 10 different colors to choose from — and don't quite match Wunderlist's or Clear's level of design. But the new smart task creation tool is a useful addition that makes it much easier to quickly add things to your to-do lists. Todoist now uses smart parsing to automatically add labels, due dates, and reminders to tasks as you add them. It's very similar to Fantastical's well-regarded event creation tool and a feature Wunderlist added just a few weeks ago.

African dung beetles, however, have apparently found a workaround — the Milky Way. A recent study from researchers in Sweden and South Africa found that on moonless nights, dung beetles use the stars to help orient themselves, a rather surprising tactic for a creature that spends so much time with its nose to the ground. In fact, scientists say these findings are the first evidence of any insect having celestial navigation capabilities. Researchers made this discovery after examining the different ways in which the beetles push their balls of dung. Under normal conditions, the insects store their dung balls in a secure location by moving it along a straight path. As the study notes, the beetles were able to replicate this behavior under moonlit nights and on dark nights when only the Milky Way was visible, but struggled to navigate under more overcast conditions. In planetarium tests, they performed equally well under a fully starlit sky and one showing only the Milky Way. When researchers strapped visors to their heads to block out the sky entirely, they were completely disoriented. A first for the insect kingdom Thus far, only birds, humans, and seals have been known to use celestial navigation techniques, but these findings raise the possibility that other nocturnal insects may rely on the stars, as well. Yet lead researcher Marie Dacke of Lund University in Sweden cautions against extrapolating her results too far, noting that dung beetles are unique in their reliance upon straight paths to collect dung. ""Dung beetles are known to use celestial compass cues such as the sun, the moon, and the pattern of polarized light formed around these light sources to roll their balls of dung along straight paths,"" Dacke said. ""Celestial compass cues dominate straight-line orientation in dung beetles so strongly that, to our knowledge, this is the only animal with a visual compass system that ignores the extra orientation precision that landmarks can offer.""",0.616090957402699,0.38390904259730096,0.807744688467006,345,5.1536231884057973,210,5.8952380952380956,0,0,Science,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The project's goal is to speed up and reduce error in the sterilization process, freeing valuable health care workers for other tasks and reducing overall costs. At the end of the two-year, $2.5 million project, GE plans to test its automated system at a Veterans Affairs hospital, though a candidate has not yet been named.

Eric Horvitz of Microsoft Research and Kira Radinsky of the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology have built a system that mines over 20 years of New York Times articles for events that could point to other, later developments. In their test model, Horvitz and Radinsky created a system to draw connections between events, then set it loose on the Times database. The system was able to ""learn"" correlations between events by looking at sequences of stories in particular places: if an article was published about a drought in one place, for example, there was an 18 percent chance of a drought being reported there later. And both droughts and storms can lead to cholera outbreaks. Not every event (like, say, ""cholera outbreak in Rwanda"") had enough data to be useful, so it also needed to be able to find and connect patterns from different kinds of events that shared characteristics. With enough data and a good model, the system could be used to give early warning signs for disasters by mining individual reports and finding larger patterns in them. The general idea of finding ways to predict diseases isn't new, nor is the concept of data mining for prediction, but the wide scope of this project makes it potentially very useful — as long as the system is able to successfully draw correlations between events, and to generalize enough to make them useful, it could be applied to any number of situations.",0.7384070607947018,0.26159293920529825,0.8160279548745387,266,4.8233082706766917,166,5.5542168674698793,0,0,Science,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Today, the US Nuclear Science Advisory Committee led by physicist Robert Tribble presented a report to the Department of Energy, prioritizing the nuclear physics projects that should be funded. As was widely expected, the hammer fell on the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC), the only American particle smasher and one of two heavy ion colliders worldwide — the other is CERN's Large Hadron Collider, currently on a multi-year hiatus. Tevatron, the only other hadron (composite particle) collider besides the LHC and RHIC, shut down in 2011. Despite endorsing the proposal, Tribble expressed regret. ""I don't think there are winners and losers here,"" Science reports him saying. ""We're all losers if this comes to pass."" He also worried that shutting down the RHIC could cause the field of physics to ""spiral down"" in the US. ""We're all losers if this comes to pass."" RHIC opened in 2000, and it was set to run well into the future, but now it could be sacrificed for other facilities the NSAC hopes will be funded. That includes an upgrade of the Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility (CEBAF) and the new Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) at Michigan State University. Tribble has told Nature that RHIC was recommended for closure only because of the funding and logistical problems: FRIB already had investments from the university, and even ending construction on it wouldn't have left enough money to run both CEBAF and the collider. Federal funding for nuclear physics was $547 million in 2012, and it's estimated to shrink in coming years, requiring tough decisions. But Doon Gibbs of Brookhaven National Laboratory, home of RHIC, insists the collider could still find funding: ""RHIC has been around 10 years and it’s got another 10 years to go.""

Yet while Japanese investigators said this week that they are yet to find any factory-level problems with the batteries, SpaceX and Tesla Motors head Elon Musk — who competes with Boeing in commercial space ventures — believes that there is a more fundamental issue in play.  ""It is simply a matter of time before there are more incidents."" ""Unfortunately, the pack architecture supplied to Boeing is inherently unsafe,"" Musk told Flightglobal. ""Large cells without enough space between them to isolate against the cell-to-cell thermal domino effect means it is simply a matter of time before there are more incidents of this nature."" Unusually, Tesla cars use lithium-ion batteries with thousands of tiny cells versus the eight-cell packs used on the 787. Though most electric automobiles use far fewer cells, Tesla says that the small cell size improves reliability and enables efficient heat transfer. ""When thermal runaway occurs with a big cell, a proportionately larger amount of energy is released and it is very difficult to prevent that energy from then heating up the neighboring cells and causing a domino effect that results in the entire pack catching fire,"" says Musk. ""I would have used the same words,"" says Donald Sadoway, a MIT Professor of Materials Chemistry and battery expert who also spoke to Flightglobal. ""I'm glad someone with such a big reputation put it on the line. He's engineered [Tesla's battery] to prevent the domino effect, while Boeing evidently doesn't have that engineering."" Sadoway recently suggested Boeing implement an active cooling system or switch to a different battery technology such as nickel metal-hydride. ""I design a cell to not fail and then assume it will."" However, Boeing's chief project engineer on the 787 believes that the batteries were designed with such concerns in mind. ""I design a cell to not fail and then assume it will and the ask the next 'what-if' questions,"" says Mike Sinnett. ""And then I design the batteries that if there is a failure of one cell it won't propagate to another. And then I assume that I am wrong and that it will propagate to another and then I design the enclosure and the redundancy of the equipment to assume that all the cells are involved and the airplane needs to be able to play through that."" Musk, whose SpaceX competes with Boeing and Lockheed Martin's United Launch Alliance for government space contracts, maintains that the 787's battery structure is likely to cause problems. ""They [Boeing] believe they have this under control, although I think there is a fundamental safety issue with the architecture of a pack with large cells."" While most lithium-ion batteries use large cells, the Dreamliner uses batteries to replace hydraulic systems on a scale not seen before in an airplane. Musk doesn't appear to be proposing a specific solution, but he says that Boeing has refused assistance from both Tesla and SpaceX. Investigators, however, say that the cause of the recent issues is still unclear.",0.3697593300643258,0.6302406699356742,0.8301062603138748,536,5.1156716417910451,290,6.2620689655172415,0,0,Science,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The internet is, on balance, a very hostile place. More than 70 percent of all email traffic is spam, and a fair portion of that is malware and phishing attempts. One 2012 census counted 1.5 billion browser-based malware attacks. A recent Team Cymru map of globally compromised computers showed nearly all of Italy lit up, with southeastern Europe glowing from the sheer quantity. None of this is particularly dangerous if you take modest measures to protect your computer, but it's a strange state of nature — and an expensive one. Most appraisals put the global cost of malware in the tens of billions. Antivirus solutions mostly protect individual nodes or networks, shifting the attacks around but doing little to combat the core of the issue. Larger companies can keep blacklists and spread best practices, but they’re limited solutions. Every time a botnet gets shut down, a new one springs up to fill the gap, slightly smarter than the one before. ZeroPoint sits on top of the network, at the carrier level As a result, many in the malware world are looking for a better line of defense — and increasingly, they're looking to telecom carriers as the answer. This fall, the Canadian SecDev Group took the stage at a Google Ideas conference to unveil their latest answer, a machine learning program known as ZeroPoint. Instead of sitting on your computer or your email server, ZeroPoint sits on top of the whole network, at the DNS or carrier level. (For the trial version, they partnered with Bell Canada.) From that vantage, it sees everything, including undiscovered variants and zero-day exploits that have never been spotted in the wild. ""Things that look like anomalies in a small network suddenly start to become patterns."" The one thing all malware has in common, according to SecDev, is that it has to phone home. And since botnet traffic moves differently from regular computer traffic, Zeropoint can spot compromised computers from watching the flow of packets through the network. ""Things that look like anomalies in a small network, when you move up to the carrier level suddenly start to become patterns,"" says SecDev CEO Rafal Rohozinski. A network like Bell Canada processes a massive amount of packets in a given day, so the system relies on machine learning to narrow it down, whitelisting some traffic, blacklisting other parts, and focusing on the unclassifiable gray area where the more sophisticated malware can be singled out. If you're looking for undiscovered threats, a top-down view of the network turns out to be a powerful tool. ""You have to trust that the box is doing what they say it's doing."" In fact, there’s already concern that the system might be too powerful. That same network-level access is often used to track people across the web, whether it’s the NSA or the open-market surveillance products sold by companies like FinFisher. There’s no guarantee Zeropoint couldn’t be used for the same thing. SecDev says the system only tracks packet movements, but it would be easy for a government agency or an unscrupulous carrier to see what the packets are carrying. ""The million-dollar problem here is, you have to trust that the box is doing what they say it's doing,"" says the ACLU’s Christopher Soghoian. After months of NSA leaks, that trust may be in short supply. Earning that trust is particularly hard because so much of the research work has to be done by hand. Once the Zeropoint algorithm has separated out obviously good and obviously bad traffic, the team takes the algorithmic recommendations and starts on something that looks more like detective work. SecDev chief operating officer Dave McMahon gave the example of a group of Canadian computers sending simultaneous weekly packets to a central hub in Morocco. Is that a botnet, or just a multinational network? Figuring it out requires patience and time, and machine learning is still ill-suited to the task. As McMahon says, ""It's easy to teach a computer to play chess, but it's hard to teach a computer to play poker."" ""It's easy to teach a computer to play chess, but it's hard to teach a computer to play poker."" It’s particularly tricky for computers because the botnets can be surprisingly well disguised. The more sophisticated the malware, the harder it is to suss out the traffic pattern, McMahon says, and the more human ingenuity is required. The majority of botnets are used for credit card theft, which usually only has a few days of shelf life before the card company catches up, so they don’t bother covering their tracks. The more complicated networks are the Advanced Persistent Threats, the state-funded actions like Stuxnet that are designed to go undiscovered for years. Zeropoint has seen them most often in Tibetan and Uighurian communities, which are frequently targeted by China and have few resources to protect themselves. The attacks are some of the most sophisticated in the world, relying on unpublished zero-day exploits and often targeting specific systems. Tracking their signals back to home base is often the only way to spot them. ""The US Government is in the malware business."" The next step for ZeroPoint, according to Rohozinski, is pitching to governments. It’s a good pitch: If the US wanted to end malware entirely, the government could easily push for something like ZeroPoint in domestic networks, and telecoms would be unlikely to push back. Those billions of dollars lost to scammers and credit card fraud might disappear, but the privacy problems would only grow more severe. Suddenly, the government would have a direct line to the heart of web traffic. At the same time, it would be easy for a government-led effort to just become one more weapon in an escalating cyberwar. ""The US government is in the malware business,"" Soghoian says, referencing Stuxnet and Flame, two targeted viruses reportedly developed by the US. ""Are devices installed by Western governments going to look for Western malware? And if not, how effective is a device that's only going to look for malware from China?"" After widespread NSA cooperation, it would be hard for any telco to be seen as acting independent from the government’s wishes, and no one else has the access to make the program work. The result is a tough technological problem, but an even bigger political one. It takes access to secure a network, and that access comes with a lot of power. As it turns out, the biggest problem with malware may be that we don’t trust anyone enough to fix it.",0.4257823939514331,0.5742176060485669,0.5020603339738815,1102,4.9900181488203268,552,6.26268115942029,0,0,"US & World, Report",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

Since then, however, the agency appears to have slowly but steadily moved forward in building its drone program. Now, details of that program have been revealed in a series of recently released documents sentI to Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), an advocacy group that issued a Freedom of Information Act request in June. Though CREW was interested in learning what company provided the FBI's drones and where the purchases' funding came from, that information is largely redacted. Even so, the documents do reveal quite a bit about the program's development, including how the FBI has been using drones and what it plans to do with them in the future.  The FBI says there are no constitutional issues with its current use of drones The documents show that the FBI's first operational drone deployment was in October, 2006. Drone use was ""limited over the next four years,"" the documents read, noting that funding issues and compliance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations were major limiting factors. While the FBI's Technical Response Unit oversaw its drone program at first, the program was transferred to its Video Surveillance Unit in 2009, at which point drone ""inventory and missions began to increase."" The documents suggest that this wasn't so much a matter of the new unit utilizing them more, but that agents began to better understand what drones were capable of. The documents don't reveal how many times drones have been used, but in a letter to Rand Paul this July, the government said that the FBI only used them 10 times for surveillance missions. As these documents show, such surveillance and search missions are among the FBI's primary uses of drones. In particular, the FBI notes that they're useful for missions where ""unique"" requirements would prohibit sending in a manned aircraft. The agency doesn't go into detail about when it authorizes the use of drones, but it does claim that ""there are neither constitutional nor statutory prohibitions"" to its current operational drone use. Details on when they can be used appear to have been written but redacted from this release, but the documents do suggest that the FBI largely applies the same rules to drones as it does to manned aerial surveillance. FAA regulations have been a continual hurdle While drone use appears to be increasing, funding deficits and FAA regulations continue to be major hurdles. The FBI's drone program doesn't receive discrete funding, but comes instead out of the Video Surveillance Unit. Annual expenditures on drones have been redacted from the documents, but one partially censored email suggests that its purchasing budget may have been ""cut to zero"" for 2013. The drone program also seems to receive little in the way of special treatment from the FAA. The documents frequently cite difficulty complying with FAA regulations as a holdup for the program, with its inability to comply with a regulation known as ""See and Avoid"" being a particular issue. Under See and Avoid, aircraft operators must maintain ""vigilance"" with regard to seeing and avoiding other aircraft — something that's difficult to do when remotely piloting a drone. The FBI notes that it's been working with the FAA to mitigate these concerns and to set up a nationwide approval system allowing it to more easily deploy drones. As of 2011, the FBI said that it was interesting in deploying more unmanned aerial systems across the agency, but the actual number of drones it's acquired appears to have been redacted from the documents — it was also working on developing a pilot training program that year. In 2012, the FBI wrote that it planned to continue using drones for search and surveillance, and that it could also employ them in other scenarios, such as assisting SWAT missions. The drone program is clearly still growing at the FBI, but while the agency may have identified plenty of uses for it, recurring troubles appear to be keeping it from getting far off the ground. CREW has posted the series of FBI documents online for others to read through, some of which have been declassified. According to Motherboard, this is only the first batch of files, and more may be on the way. A Washington, DC district court reportedly directed the FBI to release drone documents to CREW on a rolling basis, suggesting that more will come as the program advances. CREW also reportedly intends to appeal the current batch of documents' heavy censoring, potentially revealing even more detail about the program's development.",0.5010593490868931,0.4989406509131069,0.8525346094643877,782,5.0677749360613813,387,6.2739018087855296,0,0,US & World,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

Using a law classically invoked for targeting mafia and gang members, a federal court convicted a member of a web forum being used to facilitate identity theft. According to Wired, this is the first time that this law — the Racketeering Influenced Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) — has been used to prosecute cybercrime, and it could find a broader use as online black markets like Silk Road continue to gain the attention of law enforcement. With RICO, law enforcement can prosecute members of an organized crime organization, even if they aren't found to have directly committed a crime. In this case, prosecutors argued that members of the web forum ""Carder.su"" were part of a type of organized crime group, as they were required to go through a vetting process and to meet a number of security standards that would protect the forum from law enforcement. Camez faces up to 40 years in prison It appears that this involvement and the purchase of criminal goods was enough to consider David Ray Camez, the convicted member, a participant in the over 5,500-member forum. ""It is difficult to fathom the enormity and complexity of the Carder.su racketeering organization and its far-reaching tentacles across international borders,"" US attorney Daniel Bogden says in a statement. A federal jury found Camez guilty on two counts of involvement with a racketeer-influenced corrupt organization. He'll now face up to 40 years in jail and a fine of up to $250,000. Camez was previously convicted on related forgery charges after authorities found that he purchased counterfeit driver's licenses, credit cards, gift cards, and US currency. Wired reports that Camez was not also convicted as a seller of counterfeit goods. The successful prosecution of Camez suggests that law enforcement may be able to target discrete members of other criminal websites in this manner as well. ICE doesn't say exactly what it takes for users of a website facilitating criminal activity to be considered part of the related criminal organization, but Wired suggests that it could be applied to users of Silk Road or even file sharing services.

But there's plenty of small stuff too, some with great comedians and others with some strange sci-fi and fantasy. Head below to check out nine of this week's best trailers (with some clips and brief teases thrown in).   The first trailer for Terminator Genisys goes totally, irrevocably off the rails, but you kind of have to respect it for that. This fifth Terminator film takes place in an alternate timeline that basically reimagines and mashes up the events of the series' first two films. It may be playing off of nostalgia, but that's still kind of awesome. It comes out July 1st.   This may not be much of a trailer, but let's take what we can get. The 24th James Bond film finally has a name, and it has a short video teaser to go along with it. There isn't any footage yet, but that's for good reason: the movie doesn't actually start filming until later this year. It's supposed to come out on November 6th. You can go here to see everything we know about the new movie.   Yeah, we'll watch any clip that the creators of Better Call Saul want to show us, but this one is particularly great: this could just show how Saul and his soon-to-be associate Mike first met. As you might expect, it isn't pretty.   Chris Rock's latest movie seems to be winning over everyone who sees it, and its latest trailer — a far more inappropriate one — gives a strong impression of why that might be. The film has Rock playing an actor who's working to revitalize his career, and it gives a ton of great comedians, Rock included, space to do what they do best. It comes out next Friday.   Things get kind of crazy when you give Spike Lee $1.4 million on Kickstarter to make a movie. Da Sweet Blood of Jesus is supposed to be a love story about a man who becomes cursed and consumed with a thirst for blood. As is often the case, it's a film by Lee that's hard to describe, so you should probably just got ahead and watch the trailer.  It'll be out on February 13th.   While We're Young is the latest film from Noah Baumbach, a director whose understated stories often deal with 20-somethings and youth, as in 2012's Frances Ha. His new movie is about a middle-aged couple, played by Ben Stiller and Naomi Watts, whose lives are shaken up when they meet a younger and more energetic couple, played by Adam Driver and Amanda Seyfried. It's a pretty great crew of people to throw together, and you'll be able to watch the results next year on March 27th.      Somehow, there are two insane trailers this week about robots trying to kill people. I honestly have no idea what's happening for like half of this trailer, but the movie involves Bruce Willis running some crazy, sci-fi resort that lets people live out their fantasies with robots, until one eventually escapes and starts trying to kill him. It'll be out on January 16th.   Here's something for Black Mirror fans to get excited about. After almost two years, the dark sci-fi series is returning with a Christmas special involving Jon Hamm. It'll run in the UK on December 16th and on Christmas in the US — leaving plenty of time to catch up on the series if you haven't seen it yet (and you probably should).   Flight of the Conchords' Jemaine Clement is half of the writing and directing team behind What We Do in the Shadows, a strange new mockumentary about modern vampires. Early reviews of the film have been pretty positive, and anyone who's already a fan of Clement (or co-writer/director Taika Waititi, of Eagle vs Shark) ought to be interested here. It'll be out on February 13th.",0.420598536089383,0.579401463910617,0.16800741660590676,686,4.3862973760932942,387,5.4005167958656335,0,0,"Culture, Entertainment",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

""One of the 20th century's greatest recording artists."" The film, co-produced with RadicalMedia, will follow Simone's life and work across three decades. Nina Simone, a beloved and controversial figure for most of her life, was a prolific songwriter and singer across multiple genres including jazz, blues, and R&B. She was also a prominent political voice, advocating heavily for civil rights and even armed revolt on behalf of African Americans while also criticizing the Vietnam war in her music.

The first trailer for Terminator: Genisys has just been released, and it's clear that this fifth movie is a very different kind of Terminator film than what you're used to. It's a reboot of the series, and it's definitely kicking things up a notch (or more) when it comes to action and scale. The film takes place in an alternate universe where Sarah Connor is a total badass even back in 1984 and, for some reason, has a Terminator for a father. It sounds totally insane, and it probably is. Even for how crazy everything looks, it's hard for any fan of the original two movies not to be intrigued by what's going on here. The trailer makes Genisys look, in part, like a mashup of the first two films, recreating iconic scenes, lines, and villains, but positioning them all in different ways. That nostalgia trip is pretty intentional: the filmmakers know that the last couple of Terminator films have left a bad taste with people, so they're trying to throw out the bad parts of the series and spin up a compelling new story. Genisys features the same general plot about robots trying to destroy humanity, but it brings a lot more time travel into the mix. It'll also set the stage for a trilogy.

The hackers that crippled the company's computer systems have now released a vast hoard of Sony Pictures' private documents onto the internet. An analysis of more than 33,000 documents showed that they displayed passwords to internal computers, credit cards, and social media accounts, as well as the Social Security numbers of 47,000 current and former Sony Pictures workers. Among the affected are Hollywood celebrities such as Sylvester Stallone, Rebel Wilson, and Anchorman director Judd Apatow. According to The Wall Street Journal, the Social Security numbers can be found alongside salary information, home addresses, and contracts for Sony Pictures employees and freelancers. Some of the affected individuals reportedly stopped working for Sony Pictures as far back as 2000. The files weren't encrypted Buzzfeed says the information, now available on file-sharing services, was kept in documents with no encryption, and stored under plainly labeled filenames such as ""YouTube login passwords.xlsx."" In addition to YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, and MySpace logins, the documents also contained username and password information for corporate news and research services such as Bloomberg and Lexis/Nexis, information necessary to access expensive subscription-based data services such as ComScore, and the passwords for Sony Pictures' story department's email, Amazon, and FedEx accounts. The attack on the company, perpetrated by a group calling itself #GOP, is thought to have come from North Korea. The country's leaders had previously threatened ""merciless retaliation"" if the United States didn't ban showings of The Interview, the Sony Pictures movie that sees Seth Rogen and James Franco try to assassinate North Korean supreme leader Kim Jong-un. Investigators from Sony Pictures, computer security firm FireEye, and the FBI said that the hackers breached Sony's servers using similar methods to a 2013 attack on a series of South Korean banks and broadcasters. In emails to The Verge, people purporting to be responsible for the hack did not acknowledge the link to the totalitarian state, instead saying that the group wanted ""equality."" A self-identified hacker by the name of ""lena"" said that the group had help from Sony staff in order to access the information. The documents contained passwords for social media, corporate research, and credit card accounts Sony Pictures bosses responded to the breach on Tuesday, saying the attack was a ""malicious criminal act"" that left them ""deeply saddened.""

According to the AFP, the monkey was launched inside a capsule to an altitude of 75 miles before returning back to earth unscathed. ""Iran successfully launched a capsule, codenamed Pishgam (Pioneer), containing a monkey and recovered the shipment on the ground intact,"" the defense ministry's aerospace department said in a statement. The department added that the animal came back ""alive"" after completing its sub-orbital flight. Iran's monkey is alive and well Today's announcement comes two years after Iran successfully launched a ten-foot research rocket carrying a mouse, two turtles, and several worms. Officials announced plans to put a monkey in space earlier this month, as part of its ongoing mission to send a human to space by 2020, and to have an astronaut on the moon by 2025. Iran launched its first domestically built satellite into orbit in February 2009. The country reportedly failed on its first attempt to launch a rhesus monkey in 2011. At the time, officials were hoping to fire the monkey into orbit inside a Kavoshgar-5 rocket, though the mission was never widely publicized, and an explanation for its failure was never provided. Earlier this month, Iranian Space Agency head Hamid Fazeli told Mehr News that Iran was hoping to use monkeys to test the safety and feasibility of human spaceflight. ""Monkeys have similarities to humans, so with them in space, we can examine human factors in space,"" Fazeli said. Tehran's space program has raised concerns in the West President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has put an emphasis on the development of Iranian space technology in recent years, raising concerns among some in the West who fear that the program could be used to enhance Tehran's military capabilities. ""The scientific arena is where we could defeat the (West's) domination,"" Ahmadinejad said on live TV in 2010, following the successful launch of a Kavoshgar-3 rocket carrying a mouse and other animals. Critics fear that Iran could use its long-range ballistic technology to launch satellites that could be used to trigger atomic warheads. The Islamic republic, however, has vehemently denied allegations that its space and nuclear programs are being deployed for military purposes. At the dawn of the space race, both the US and USSR would frequently send animals into space in order to test the safety of human spaceflight. The first monkey to enter orbit was a rhesus named Albert I, who rode into space aboard a US military V-2 rocket in 1948, but tragically suffocated and died during the flight. Update: Iran has released images of the monkey. Warning, you may find the images upsetting.

Light has the power to push particles, as Johanes Kepler determined when he observed that the tails of comets point away from the sun. However, scientists have discovered that there's a very small window in which this principle reverses, and light attracts certain microscopic particles instead. The principle's reversal depends on the size and composition of the particles being attracted, which means that this technology could be used to sort specific cells — you can see an example in the video below. Unfortunately, we're a long way off from a Star Trek scale tractor beam.

Judging by an event DARPA is holding next month, however, it looks like the agency is unsurprisingly thinking about how this technology can be applied to the military. DARPA is hoping to develop ""transient electronics,"" systems that are ""capable of physically disappearing in a controlled, triggerable manner,"" that function similarly to the ""commercial-off-the-shelf"" systems currently used. The benefit to the military is twofold — DARPA believes it is ""nearly impossible"" to both track and recover all of the electronic microsystems the military distributes, and there's also an environmental impact to be aware of. Ideally, these devices could be dissolved in a number of ways: by a set program, a remote trigger, or a trigger that responds to the environment. Particularly unconventional is DARPA's vision of devices that could ""reabsorb into the body"" — electronics that could monitor solidiers in the field and disappear into the body when their usefulness has past.   We're still a ways from this technology being deployed, so DARPA is inviting scientists and manufacturers to a ""Vanishing, Programmable Resources (VAPR) Day"" on February 14th in Virginia.

Several fungi were also present, but bacteria were considerably more abundant at about 144 bacterial cells per cubic foot of air, making up about 20 percent of all particles in the 0.25-1 micron diameter range. Based on the study, scientists hypothesize that the bacterial makeup of the atmosphere could potentially influence the planet's weather patterns, including cloud formation and precipitation levels. According to io9, researchers also speculate that the presence of Escherichia, Streptococcus, and other microscopic fecal matter could contribute to the spread of disease as the troposphere circulates.",0.6911470975778286,0.30885290242217145,0.8781675165589456,201,5.7164179104477615,137,6.6131386861313866,0,0,Science,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Titled Go Set a Watchman, the Associated Press reports that the book will be released in July, with publisher HarperCollins planning a first printing of 2 million copies. In the announcement, Lee states that the new novel is essentially a sequel to To Kill a Mockingbird, despite being completed first. ""It features the character known as Scout as an adult woman,"" Lee said in the statement given to Harper, ""and I thought it a pretty decent effort. My editor, who was taken by the flashbacks to Scout's childhood, persuaded me to write a novel (what became To Kill a Mockingbird) from the point of view of the young Scout."" The original manuscript for Go Set a Watchman had been lost until the author's lawyer Tonja Carter rediscovered it and persuaded Lee to have it published. Scout returns to Maycomb after 20 years Lee's new novel will follow Jean Louise ""Scout"" Finch in the mid-1950s, 20 years after the events of To Kill a Mockingbird and at a moment when the Civil Rights Movement was gaining momentum. According to the publisher's announcement, ""She is forced to grapple with issues both personal and political as she tries to understand her father's attitude toward society, and her own feelings about the place where she was born and spent her childhood."" The 88-year-old Lee's original novel is universally considered a landmark in modern American fiction, so a sequel is huge news for readers. And it performs incredibly well to this day, selling 750,000 copies a year. The author, for her part, has stayed mostly silent since the novel's publication 55 years ago, coming out of seclusion to mark the book's 50th anniversary in 2010.

As the Wall Street Journal reports, the approximately $1 million campaign was launched by Code.org, a nonprofit organization that has so far raised $10 million from supporters like Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, and major technology companies. More than 33,000 schools in 166 countries will dedicate at least one hour this week to computer science education as part of Code.org's initiative, which is timed to coincide with this year's Computer Science Education Week.  The effort has earned endorsements from tech companies, celebrities, and politicians, including both President Barack Obama and House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R - VA), who each released video statements urging students to participate. ""Don't just download the latest app, help design it,"" Obama said in a video address released this week. ""Don't just play on your phone, program. No one's born a computer scientist, but with a little hard work — and some math and science — just about anyone can become one.""   The Hour of Code is part of Code.org's broader campaign to encourage computer science education at more classrooms, bridging what many see as a growing gap between Silicon Valley and US curricula. The Bureau of Labor estimates that more than 140,000 computer science jobs are added to the American economy every year, while according to the National Science Foundation, just 40,000 college students are graduating with computer science degrees. ""In California, computer science has the same classification as a class on horseshoe making."" Code.org founder Hadi Partovi, a former Microsoft executive, aims to reverse that trend by promoting computer programming among students and educators, though there are institutional hurdles, as well. One of the problems, he says, is that many US states recognize programming courses as an elective, rather than a core component of math and science classes. States like Washington and Idaho changed their policies this year, though many — including California — have not. ""In California, computer science has the same classification as a class on horseshoe making,"" Partovi told the Wall Street Journal.

Rowling, Dan Brown, or E.L. James. Her book, Girl Online, is being sold as a ""modern day Notting Hill for teens"" and follows the adventures of 16-year-old Penny Porter whose personal blog goes viral after she falls in love with a New York rock star. The novel sold 78,109 copies in the week beginning November 25th, according Nielsen BookScan figures reported by The Telegraph, easily beating Fifty Shades of Grey (14,814 copies in the first week) and Angels and Demons (98 copies). It also handily outstrips the initial print run of 1,000 for the first ever Harry Potter book — although, as with the previous examples, Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling didn’t have a huge, ready-made fan base queueing up to buy her work. (Consequently, it's worth noting that debut sales aren't necessarily indicative of prolonged future success.) Penguin bought the book after feedback from the CEO's 13-year-old-daughter Zoella may not be a name in the literary world, but even publishing executives know better than to ignore her 6.5 million subscribers on YouTube. At the launch of Girl Online, Penguin Random House CEO Tom Weldon said he had been initially skeptical about signing Zoella but changed his mind after consulting his 13-year-old daughter. Weldon is so confident that Zoella is set to publish a sequel in summer 2015, with the publishing exec telling the audience at Girl Online’s launch that he expects to keep selling her books ""for many, many years to come."" A review by The Telegraph said the book's message was that ""growing up doesn’t have to mean leaving childish stuff behind,"" before adding that ""even Winnie the Pooh might regard [the novel] as a bit twee."" Not that it matters, with the sales figures showing that Girl Online is not only the UK’s best-selling debut novel, it’s also the best-selling hardcover title for the entire year.

Skyfall's director (Sam Mendes) and screenwriters (John Logan, Neal Purvis, and Robert Wade) have all returned for the new film, as has Daniel Craig in the titular role. According to Mendes, in a Charlie Rose interview from earlier this year, Bond 24 (as it was then called) won't be a direct sequel to Skyfall but will live in the same world — meaning we'll be seeing more of Ralph Fiennes, Naomie Harris, Rory Kinnear, and Ben Whishaw.

Guardians of the Galaxy's Dave Bautista had been strongly rumored (now confirmed) for the role of Hinx, a henchman that will no doubt laugh every time Bond tries to punch him, before succumbing to Bond's wily antics and use of environmental objects late in the film.

My body recoils, but I continue pushing forward until I’m just inches from their fractured faces, frozen with terror. I can't hide. I’m helpless. The feeling is real, even though the scene I’m witnessing is not. This isn't a game, it's virtual reality storytelling at its best: the Oculus Rift disappears and becomes the medium through which the artist communicates an experience. At its worst, VR is a gimmick, a parlor trick that usurps the story being told. I saw examples of both at the International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam (IDFA).    Back to back over the span of an hour, I wore an Oculus Rift DK2 to view what IDFA calls four of the ""best and most engrossing virtual reality creations to date,"" none of which are games: Assent, Zero Point, Clouds, and Strangers with Patrick Watson. That's good for me, because I hate video games. Or rather, I love gaming but I hate how my obsessive gameplay disrupts all other aspects of my life. So I quit. Fortunately, the future of VR holds more promise than just immersive gaming. Using the Oculus Rift can easily overwhelm first time users. The experience is so different from anything before it that you can't help but lose your shit; mouth agape, bent into childlike wonder as you reach out to grasp at polygons that don't exist. This was not my first experience, having first tried a prototype back in January 2013. For me, the gee-whizziness of VR is gone, allowing me to focus on the story being told, not the means by which it is presented. For first-timers, however, the medium quite literally becomes the message.  The transition from radio to television was no different. Neighbors and friends would gather around the first TV on the block, amazed by the little man in the box with no care at all for the story he was telling. But then it became common and the television disappeared so that the stories could thrive. This will happen with VR, too.   I began my VR marathon with Strangers, Felix & Paul Studio’s… thing. It’s hard to describe in traditional terms because it’s not like describing a film or documentary — there’s no story here. It’s an experience filmed with a 360-degree 3D camera. It’s akin to the genre of Slow TV in the 2D world, video coverage that documents the minutia of everyday life over several hours. Strangers only lasts five minutes, but it lingers in the psyche for much longer. An assistant carefully, and awkwardly, fits the DK2 to my face while seated in the public screening room. How clean is this, I wonder, as my thoughts turn briefly to the threat of global pandemics. Unfolding an ear, I make a final adjustment to the ill-fitting headphones before the display flips on, transporting me to the center of a room. I’m invisible, seated between a disheveled piano player — Canadian musician Patrick Watson — and an indolent dog stretched out on a wooden floor. I see pixels everywhere, like what you’d see when standing too close to those massive displays in Times Square. Am I supposed to do something? I think, spinning on my stool in the real world, searching for navigation clues back in the virtual one. After a few minutes I relax and just go with it as Watson lights a cigarette. He's a chain smoker, I think, watching the smoke billow towards me from the well-used pedestal ashtray standing to his right. Why can’t I smell it? The foolishness of the thought snaps the pixels back into focus as I laugh at myself for being tricked. Now keenly aware of what’s real and what’s not, I look around at all the instruments, the furniture, the wall hangings and knick-knacks, as Watson hums into his mic. I begin building a profile of this person, this stranger in front of me. I look out the window, searching for an architectural clue as to what big city this is. Berlin, Seattle maybe, I think, casually deconstructing the silvery Montreal terrain beyond the windows. It’s when he stops playing and stands up that a sense of shame washes over me. Jesus, don’t make eye contact with me, I shudder. I feel guilty for having dared to spy on him for so long. It’s called Stranger, but the intimacy is real.   I was less impressed with Clouds and Zero Point, my experience mirroring that of my colleagues. Clouds now feels like a dated proof-of-concept for both the Oculus Rift and hybrid DSLR and Kinect video capture technique employed. It’s VR as a prop. Zero Point, as The Verge’s own Adi Robertson already pointed out, ""isn't particularly revelatory or engrossing as a film."" It’s a tech demo for Condition One’s 360-degree footage. Yeah, it was cute to be up close muzzle-to-muzzle with a snotty-nosed bison, but that’s just a gimmick, fun as it was. For me, Oscar Raby’s Assent, a crudely rendered 10-minute documentary-short developed in the Unity game engine, is virtual reality storytelling at its finest. Instead of recounting Chile’s brutal 1973 coup d'état with facts and figures, Raby puts me in the shoes of his (then) 22-year-old father who was irrevocably changed upon witnessing a military execution — a military he was part of. Using the newfound tools and techniques of VR to focus on empathy, not statistical information, is what makes Assent so powerful. The first thing I learn upon entering Assent’s virtual world is how to control my movements by staring at visual cues. And by controlling my movement I’m also in control of the story’s pace. Only at the end, at the grand climatic moment, do I lose control of both. As gunfire rings out, I frantically try extracting myself using the same mechanics that brought me here. But now there’s no escape, I’m pulled on a rail directly into the grotesquery of the victims stretched out in front of me and the soldiers firing shoulder to shoulder from behind. I’m forced to witness an historical atrocity from the very nucleus of death. If this were a traditional documentary, the camera in the tracking shot (aka, dolly shot) would follow along with the moving subject. In VR though, where the camera becomes your eyes, it's something entirely different. ""You're not in control,"" explains Raby, ""You're being controlled and that changes the narrative capacity."" And he’s right. I felt utterly helpless — the same thing Raby's father felt 41 years before me.   Even the glitchy limitations of the Unity game engine add a kind of abstract terror to the work, causing the convulsing bodies of the prisoners to appear splintered and shattered in eternal repose. But it’s the closeness at which I’m forced to observe them that’s so unsettling. ""It's a passive threat,"" says Raby, ""It's a visual trigger that's activating memories in you. Perhaps dead bodies, or gargoyles, or walking through a cemetery alone."" Whatever it was from my own past, Raby's Assent exploited it brilliantly. Our reaction to everything from art to crime is shaped by the complex history of our experiences. Raby tells of an elderly man that viewed his documentary at a film festival in London. ""He took the mask off, he was sweaty,"" recalls Raby. ""He looks at me and in a Chilean accent tells me 'you know what, I was friends with one of the prisoners, he was my best friend.’"" Raby froze. ""My natural reaction, the one that I've learned to expect over the years, is hate. I'm seeing the hate coming at me. I mean it's going to show up in some way: you were part of this, your family. And he looked at me and he hugged me."" Raby spent the next hour talking with him about their lives, Raby’s father, and the things they all went through. ""So, yeah,"" says Raby, ""all sorts of reactions."" Not everyone comes away so deeply moved. Adele Tulli, a 31-year-old documentarian thought the emotional connection with Oscar's father would have been better told through a traditional documentary format. ""It was like playing,"" she told me, the pink circumference of the Oculus Rift still traced on her face. ""Film can be more emotional, more powerful. But it’s an interesting beginning, these are pioneers of a new language."" Thijme, an 18-year-old student at the Netherlands Film Academy, dismissed the artistic genre entirely. ""VR is more for interactive gaming."" It’s important to note that for both Tulli and Thijme, this was the very first time that either had used an Oculus Rift. Caspar Sonnen, founder and curator of the IDFA DocLab responsible for the virtual reality show, thinks that VR is inevitable as a medium for storytelling. The only question is the scale of mainstream adoption. ""Maybe it'll be mainstream like poetry, where everyone knows what it is but not many people buy it, or like opera, where it's very expensive because the experience is unique and special,"" says Sonnen. ""But it still has to be perfected."" VR in its current state is littered with distractions that can easily defeat the illusion of immersion. These range from the inadvertent tugs on the headset cable when turning too far (something already solved by Samsung's new Gear VR) and the giant pixels seen on media captured by 360-degree cameras to the bulky headset weighed down with over-the-ear headphones. And then there’s the nausea, which thankfully doesn’t affect me. ""striving for the maximum level of immersion is kind of like an inflatable doll."" That’s not to say that virtual reality needs to be a perfect representation of our physical reality. As Sonnen explains, ""If we’re talking about telling stories, then striving for the maximum level of immersion is kind of like an inflatable doll."" It’s a slippery slope, a kind of virtual uncanny valley that's unlikely to satisfy. ""You start with an erotic story, then add a physical body, make it talk, move, and even add heat. But you get to a point of, wait a minute, what are we trying to do here? Wasn’t the book enough to mediate the experience?"" In other words, VR doesn’t need to render reality perfectly for the user to get lost in the sense of immersion. Even unrefined representations can entertain and conjure real emotional responses. Take Strangers with Patrick Watson, for example. ""It took me a couple weeks and I realized the experience wasn't leaving me, it stuck with me,"" recounts Sonnen. ""Later someone mentioned Patrick Watson to me and I almost said that I know him, that I met him. But I didn’t. I only met him in VR."" Besides, you've surely enjoyed watching films at home despite the living room windows reflecting on the television screen. Or, you’ve gotten lost in a film despite someone coughing during the meet-cute scene. VR's no different — the act of simply putting on the headset primes your expectations, just as entering a magnificent cathedral prepares you for the experience of a virtual deity. The last time the consumer electronics industry tried coaxing me into wearing something on my face was with its massive push of 3D televisions. I never got 3D TV; I get VR. My day immersed in the Oculus Rift has made one thing abundantly clear: virtual reality is a viable form of entertainment. Not someday. Right now. And not just for gaming. VR has made the leap from a fantastical tech demo of first-person shooters to an experiential platform that feels inevitable — a medium through which we’ll participate in new forms of entertainment that are only just now being explored.",0.5185248796645409,0.48147512033545914,0.1704973680398895,1963,4.8364747834946513,976,6.293032786885246,0,15,"Culture, Entertainment, Report",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

As with prior years, Earworm (aka Jordan Roseman) has compiled the top 25 singles of 2014 into a kind of found-art musical essay. ""Do What You Wanna Do"" is a markedly more optimistic track than 2013’s ""Living The Fantasy,"" with this year’s chart-toppers imploring us to ""shake it off"" (Taylor Swift) and ""let it go"" (Idina Menzel), because we’ve got ""one less problem"" (Ariana Grande). It’s also far more hip-hop-driven than recent USOP mash-ups, with Jeremih and YG’s ubiquitous ""Don’t Tell Em"" and Jason Derulo’s ""Talk Dirty"" figuring prominently in the mix. Roseman released this year’s mix via Billboard, bringing his musical ode to the charts full circle. Earworm’s mash-ups are always valuable as succinct musical time capsules Earworm’s mash-ups are always valuable as succinct musical time capsules — his 2009 mix, which is still his most viewed on YouTube, still elicits a strong emotional response for anyone who remembers self-medicating with Lady Gaga and T.I. during that nearly-universally-loathed year. ""Do What You Wanna Do"" resembles that release in tone and sentiment, but it’s the first time I’ve come away from an Earworm mash-up feeling like pop music missed the mark this year.

The format, Stems, can store up to four individual tracks within a single mixed file, which means that different components of a song (the drums and vocals, for instance) could be made available as isolated audio. For DJs and remixers, that makes the task of reusing key components of a source track much, much easier. That may not be Stems' most interesting trick, though: the format is completely backward compatible, so you can load a Stems song into any media player that supports MP4 and have it play like a normal song. Only when you load a Stems file into an app that specifically supports its advanced features — Native Instruments' own Traktor DJ suite, for instance — do the individual tracks within the song become available.  Not for everyday listeners The theory is that producers will be interested in upcharging for Stems files versus conventional audio formats, but higher price isn't the only reason that everyday listeners won't want to start using them. They're significantly larger than a normal audio file because each track is stored separately in addition to the fully mixed song, and audiophiles will be disappointed to learn that they're not available in a lossless format. Basically, these are strictly for use by DJs of the bedroom and professional variety — but within that market segment, Stems could end up going big. Online music stores Beatport, Juno, and Traxsource have signed up to start offering Stems files for sale, and a free utility released by Native Instruments will let producers to create their own. Files, tools, and technical specifications for the format will all launch this June.",0.6106668300302825,0.38933316996971745,0.5100095780594938,310,5.0096774193548388,196,5.7448979591836737,0,0,Tech,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

As part of that effort, it ended up speaking with designer Khoi Vinh, known for overhauling The New York Times' website during the late 2000s, and using his input to create an iPad app for quickly throwing together layouts, be it for a website or a flier. Today, that app is finally being released under the name Comp CC.  Vinh wanted to start his layout work on an iPad Adobe calls Comp CC the ""digital answer to the back of a napkin,"" and that's a pretty good way of putting it. The app is supposed to allow designers to quickly sketch out a layout as they would on paper and then take that sketch a step further. Rather than leaving a designer with shapes and lines, Comp CC allows designers to import their own images and access TypeKit's font library. At the end, they should have something that resembles a usable rough draft, which can be imported into Photoshop, Illustrator, or InDesign for further work.   Comp CC really plays off the idea of sketching. Rather than selecting ""circle"" or ""square"" or ""text,"" you just draw a circle or a square or a couple of lines, and Comp CC fills them in with proper placeholders. As you're sketching, you can then change an image placeholder into an actual image or switch the font used in a line of text. The app wants to help you make something that looks pretty decent pretty quickly. Vinh demoed an early version of the app, then going by the codename Layup, at Adobe's conference last year. Vinh said that he told Adobe he wanted to be able to start his design process on an iPad. ""I'm a big fan of these devices,"" he said. ""They're so powerful, so comfortable. They're reshaping the way we think about work. And I believe they can also reshape the creative process and change up how we approach creative problem solving.""  Adobe obviously doesn't expect anyone to do all of their work in Comp CC, but the idea is that it can be used to get some work done — and maybe even in a more constructive way than other tools would have allowed. The iPad still sits in a weird place between being powerful enough to assist ""real work"" and being used too casually to generate ""real work."" Comp CC seems to play to that middle ground: it's powerful, as tablet apps now can be, but it remains straightforward and focused on moving quickly, without total precision. That's a nice combination, and it could make Comp CC the kind of mobile app that Adobe has been looking for. ""It’s not a desktop tool that has been ported to the iPad or a replica of real world art materials,"" Vinh writes in a blog post. Instead, he says, Comp CC is designed to be ""a wholly different approach"" tailored to the iPad's strengths. Comp CC is, naturally, meant to complement a Creative Cloud subscription. You can use the app even if you don't have one, but you won't be able to take your creations much further when you're done. The app is free to download and use, though you will have to sign up for a free Creative Cloud account.",0.6150541624446574,0.3849458375553426,0.13205650280480344,582,4.4587628865979383,321,5.5514018691588785,0,2,"Apps, Tech",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The lockscreen typically bricks a phone after 10 bad guesses and has proven difficult to bypass on non-jailbroken phones, but MDSec has found a way to power off the phone before it registers an incorrect guess, allowing effectively unlimited guesses. Apple seems to have updated to protect against the bug in iOS 8.1.1, but any iPhones running 8.1 or earlier will still be affected. MDSec's system works by watching for tiny changes in the iPhone screen, indicating a wrong-password notification a fraction of a second before the phone tallies a wrong guess. Once the system sees the screen change, it cuts off power, shutting down the phone before the wrong guess is counted. Done right, it allows attackers to cycle through all 10,000 possible passcodes without locking the phone, effectively bypassing the iPhone's first line of security.  It requires a lot of skill to pull that off, particularly in securing the power supply. Turning the device off that quickly means cracking open the device and physically disconnecting the battery to put everything on USB power. The shutdown process also means every guess takes roughly 40 seconds, so cycling through all 10,000 would take the better part of a week, which would give users ample time to trigger the phone's shutdown feature. Still, it's plausible thieves might try the approach as a way to bypass the lockscreen, simply because of the substantial payoff when the system is successful. More broadly, it's a sign of how exacting security research can be. The only vulnerability here is in the order of processes, displaying that a passcode has failed a few steps before the internal system adds the wrong guess to its running tally.

Stories of great tentacled Kraken in Scandinavia and in the scientific writings of Pliny the Elder are some of the earliest indications that such monsters were thought to exist. Giant squid have also left evidence of their existence tangled up in fishing nets and washed ashore all over the world. Despite their massive size (adults can grow up to about 40 feet from tip to tentacle and weigh up to 610 pounds) searching for them has been a needle-in-a-haystack endeavor.  The first video footage of a giant squid in its natural habitat will air this Sunday on the Discovery Channel in Monster Squid: The Giant is Real. The show is the culmination of years of searching, and a successful six-week expedition 550 miles south of Tokyo in June of 2012. ""It’s not that they’ve been evading us,” explains Craig McClain, Assistant Director of Science National Evolutionary Synthesis Center and founder of Deep Sea News. “It's more that our daily activities don't overlap with their daily activities."" Only around five percent of the oceans on Earth have been explored, and everything about the behavior of the elusive giant squid has been inferred from chance sightings at sea and dissecting beached carcases. Unlike its relative the humboldt squid which hunts in schools, the giant squid is thought to be a solitary creature. Also, until about twenty years ago, the best submersibles were made of opaque metals, and no camera could withstand the pressure and cold of the deepest waters. Discovery and Japanese television company NHK began plotting the ultimate giant squid mission in 2006, but after watching repeated and fruitless attempts by National Geographic and others, there was hesitation about investing resources. But premiere squid scientists Tsunemi Kubodera of Japan’s National Museum of Nature and Science, American oceanographer Edie Widder, and Kiwi renegade marine biologist Steve O'Shea convinced producers that they could find the squid. But they still needed the equipment. Enter Ray Dalio, billionaire manager of the world's largest hedge fund, who just happened to own a fully equipped research vessel. Dalio made his 56-meter motor yacht, the Alucia, available for NHK and Discovery to charter for the expedition, along with three submersible vessels, one of which is ""the sexiest, most contemporary deep submersible that money can buy,"" according to the manufacturers. ""He really just wanted to have an opportunity to go under water, just he and his family,"" said Bruce Jones, CEO of Triton Subs, who manufactured the craft used to capture the footage. ""Then he decided that since he had these assets, he might as well use them for some scientific progress."" The team knew this was likely to be the last opportunity they had to search for the mythic creature, and on June 22nd, 2012, they boarded the Alucia and set off for six weeks afloat in the vast, blue sea. Kubodera had captured still pictures of giant squid near the Ogasawara Islands, so the team used that as a starting point, setting sail from Sagami Bay. Patrick Lahey, President of Triton Subs, joined the team on the Alucia to train the pilots and crew members in operating the submersibles. Three people would be in a submersible on every dive: a scientist, a photographer, and a pilot. During the six weeks they kept an around-the-clock schedule of missions. Each of the 55 jaunts below the surface lasted eight to 10 hours, and they took full advantage of the sub's capabilities, often reaching its max depth of 1000 meters. “You are down there and you are absolutely lost in time and space,” O’Shea said. Lahey says, “we all have to be a little bit crazy to do this,” because these expeditions are often emotionally and physically draining on crew members. Even the world's foremost giant squid researchers know virtually nothing about the way the giant squid behaves in its natural habitat, so they were forced to guess at how to lure it in front of a camera. Each of the researchers took a different approach, with success hinging on one main unknown: do giant squid prefer the lights on or off? Widder, who has a PhD in Neurobiology and specializes in bioluminescence, sunk to the depths in the dark, extending a glass orb with flashing LEDs as bait. Her goal was to mimic the light display of a deep-sea jellyfish called atolla, which release a glowing chemical while being attacked. She'd observed that smaller squid were attracted to this jellyfish, but had never found any evidence that squid eat them. She concluded that squid were using the jellyfish as a “bioluminescent burglar alarm,” eating whatever was eating the jellyfish. ""You've got this small thing lighting up because this medium sized thing is munching on it, and the goal of the small thing is to get away from what's eating it,"" she explained. Widder didn't capture any video footage of Architeuthis while in the submersible, but she did capture five different recordings of giant squids by dangling a “Medusa” — her bioluminescent lures and a camera system — from a buoy on the surface. O'Shea took a drastically different approach. He armed himself with a mixture of chemicals extracted from the mantles, arms and gonads of fully mature male and female giant squids, which he predicted would act as a pheromone to attract adults, and descended into the abyss ""lights blazing, singing Neil Diamond, making as much noise as possible, squirting all sorts of chemicals into the water.” Why, if a major hypothesis of his respected colleague was that the giant squids have an aversion to white light? “Because I firmly believe that these squid don't give a damn about light or sound."" When it comes to speculation on the mental prowess of the giant squid, O’Shea is dismissive. “I think it's one of the most stupid animals in the ocean. The only thing going through that 20 gram brain is eating and breeding.” In his dives, O’Shea had lots of creatures attack the bait, and even the sub — on a 500 meter dive they once felt a thump from below and found themselves shrouded in a massive ink cloud. O’Shea saw more squid than anyone else during his dives with the lights on, but none were of the giant variety. In the end, the successful approach was Kubodera’s, who descended like a deep-sea ninja, as quietly and invisibly as possible. Like Widder, he made use of the infrared lighting system and turned off everything electronic in the sub, including the temperature control system. He thought giant squids may be especially sensitive to sound vibrations. He sat staring out into the black abyss for eight hours at a time, cameras aimed at a diamond squid as bait. And finally, on one lucky occasion, Architeuthis approached. What followed was an inter-species staring competition. The squid explored the bait suspended in front of the sub, “sitting there for the most of 18 minutes looking beautiful,” as O’Shea put it. O’Shea and Kubodera have held opposing hypotheses about the giant squid’s hunting behavior for as long as they’ve known each other, and were hoping that finally seeing it in motion would settle the bet once and for all. Kubodera thought the animal would be an aggressive hunter darting around and quickly projecting its tentacles out to pull prey into its mouth. ""I always thought that it was a dopey, giant thing that was floating at a 45 degree angle through the water column, dangling the two long tentacles down,"" O’Shea said. When they watched the video footage, each declared their own hypothesis confirmed. O'Shea says he shed a single tear when he saw the giant squid on video for the first time. ""All I felt was overjoyed. It had now been done. We can now relax. We can now move on.” Back on land, producers at Discovery are ecstatic for the giant squid’s 15 minutes, and grateful their gamble paid off. ""Had we not succeeded I'm not sure anybody would have tried again,"" said Christina Weber, VP for Production and Development for Specials at Discovery. To celebrate the discovery, Dalio flew famous biologist and atheist Richard Dawkins out to meet the research team on the yacht, which Dawkins later blogged about. While the scientists no doubt delighted in breaking new ground, their true bounty was the potential for the giant squid to act as an emblem of the deep, as a symbol with the power to convince the average television watcher of the necessity of preserving the earth's oceans. The question remains as to whether viewers will see the squid as majestic and beautiful, or as a monster like the show’s title asserts. “We are in the entertainment business. We don't always want to preach to the choir,” Weber said, explaining that putting “monster” in the title was a ploy to lure in an audience beyond the scientific types who are already inclined to tune in. ""We're driven to find all this weird and wonderful stuff on film for you guys, but at the same time what's driving us is conservation. We use these charismatic megafauna as our hook to lure you into far more important matters,” O’Shea said. ""People are going to see this on television and start giving a damn about the marine environment.” The giant squid may have been the holy grail, but it wasn’t quite the final frontier. There is evidence of a squid even bigger than the giant squid out there called the colossal squid. Now that the elements for successful deep sea exploration voyages have been established, it’s only a matter of time before someone attempts to capture the colossal squid in Antarctica.",0.6136807613339034,0.38631923866609663,0.7898073492564844,1641,4.9408897014015842,830,6.2518072289156628,0,0,,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Superbugs like MRSA cause thousands of deaths per year thanks to their resistance to traditional antibiotics. MRSA, for example, can survive and multiply in ""biofilms"" — extra-cellular matrixes that can thrive on virtually any surface. Hospitals can kill MRSA using traditional disinfectants, but such ethanol- and bleach-based substances evaporate rapidly and aren't ideal for application to skin. In collaboration with the Institute of Bioengineering and Nanotechnology (or IBN, confusingly), IBM has developed a new kind of hydrogel, a substance that can destroy bacteria while also providing long-lasting protection. The hydrogel is non-toxic and biodegradable, and is suitable for application to human skin as well as surfaces and medical equipment. To create the hydrogel, IBM used materials and techniques developed as part of its semi-conductor program. It created what it calls ""ninja polymers,"" nanostructures that destroy infected cells before biodegrading.  The benefit of utilizing the polymers instead of traditional techniques is that there are no damaging side effects to healthy cells, and because they biodegrade there's no accumulation of material over time.

Tenth Amendment is also pushing state-level legislation in California that would bar state employees from cooperating with the NSA, and bar NSA-contracted corporations from doing business with the state.

However, that a 32-year-old executive order with the force of law should help govern how the NSA operates might also help galvanize its most ardent critics. Update: ACLU staff attorney Catherine Crump issued this statement regarding the NSA's data collection practices: ""The NSA claims its collection is incidental, but there is no question it’s deliberately engaging in the mass collection of cell phone location data that it knows will inevitably sweep up information on a huge number of innocent Americans. And, all of this is happening without any supervision by a court. Unfortunately, this program is just one of many in which the NSA monitors countless innocent individuals to identify the tiny fraction who may be of interest.

The legislation has been met with protests and criticism by the public, with many fearing that the law will be used to silence media outlets or allow government officials to cover up their actions. Reuters reports that under the law, public employees and others with access to state secrets could be jailed up to 10 years for leaking them, while journalists and other private sector employees could be jailed up to five years for seeking out state secrets through ""grossly inappropriate"" means.  Information can be marked as secret for 60 years or longer But many are concerned that private employees could be punished simply for seeking information that they weren't aware was a state secret in the first place. Reuters reports that leaders of all ministries will have authority to create state secrets that are held for up to 60 years — sometimes longer. According to the Associated Press, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe pressed for the law, saying that it was a necessity for protecting national security and ensuring that the United States was comfortable sharing sensitive information with them. Others have shown concern around the lack of oversight written into the new law, reports the AP. Lawmakers also showed concern over how it would impact business between private and public employees. ""People will be living in a society where they could be punished for not knowing what’s secret and what’s not,"" Sohei Nihi, a Japan Communist Party legislator, reportedly said while arguing against the bill. Even some members of the prime minister's own party felt that the legislation had been passed too quickly.

""We think that this law is extremely important for our connections with our allies and other foreign nations,"" chief cabinet secretary Yoshihide Suga tells Reuters. ""I believe that people will come to understand."" The legislation's passing comes as US government secrets continue to spill out from information leaked by Edward Snowden.

Both documents were published to help meet the standards of the Open Government Project, an international agreement founded by the US and seven other countries in 2011, and they're behind much of the administration's ""big data"" push, which strives to put government records in the public eye. With the newest plan, the White House says it's committed to ""concrete and measurable goals for achieving a more transparent, participatory, and collaborative government."" Some of the plan is meant to streamline and expand services that were built under the first action plan, including White House petition platform We the People and Data.gov, a repository of data collected by federal agencies. Other parts involve getting citizens involved in things like local budget development and public comment on regulations. But the most interesting parts lay out the broad strokes of Obama's plan to expand transparency of federal records, whether by improving Freedom of Information Act records processing or declassifying more documents. The last action plan created a 'professionalized' FOIA system, but not a tech-savvy one To understand the White House's latest action plan, it's helpful to look at a final review of the original, conducted in March 2013 by the Open the Government coalition. The group, which counts the EFF, Electronic Privacy Information Center, and dozens of other organizations, found that the administration successfully followed the letter of many of its goals, and that it made successful strides towards making government information more accessible. However, in FOIA, declassification, and other areas, it either fell short or completed only the minimum requirements to reach its goals. Its effort to ""professionalize"" FOIA employee operations, for example, was successful, but ""the state of the use of technology for FOIA processing is still well below the modern expectations of civil society organizations."" Now, the administration promises it will adopt a centralized FOIA portal, develop core practices that will be the same across the over 100 agencies that accept requests, and improve both agency policies and employee training in hopes of working through the backlog that's accumulated because of inefficiency. It's also establishing a ""FOIA modernization advisory committee"" to take public comment and create a better system — hopefully putting an end to things like the broken fax machine that hobbled Pentagon submission requests back in September. New declassification tools could help work through a massive backlog of requests The administration's declassification project will get a similar advisory committee, and agencies will begin testing new document analysis systems that could make the process quicker. It will also create a monitoring system to keep track of records and notify agencies when documents are ready for declassification reviews. The overview of Obama's first action plan essentially found that administration had made good on its promise to declassify more records and start addressing the huge backlog, but that it just wasn't able to do so fast enough. In addition to overall structural changes, the administration is looking for a better way to declassify historical nuclear program documents and presidential records. White House petitions and Data.gov are getting an overhaul Historical documents, however, are of much less interest right now than the surveillance and intelligence records that could shed light on programs we've discovered through Edward Snowden. In this document, the administration reiterates promises it made months ago, saying it's committed to declassifying as much information about government surveillance as possible and seek input from civil liberties experts. Intelligence agencies have unmistakably begun to release more information since the leaks, and it's likely we'll see declassifications continue at a similar rate next year. Presciently, the March review praised Obama's whistleblower protection legislation but cited ""deep concerns"" about an exception for national security, though not for the reasons that were often discussed after the first Snowden leaks. Instead, it said the loophole would allow agencies to retaliate against whistleblowers by arbitrarily saying they had access to ""sensitive"" information regardless of their actual duties. This time around, the agency's policies are expansive but vague — any changes made from them may well be moot for actual whistleblowers. Obama has a few more years to implement his open government plans, and some projects, like the We the People improvements, are well underway. On a larger scale, though, it must still address major transparency issues that can't be solved simply with better technology, as well as keep working on technological fixes outside the realm of transparency, like HealthCare.gov.",0.6093875923332189,0.39061240766678107,0.8633083180545998,755,5.660927152317881,443,6.7155756207674946,0,0,"Policy & Law, US & World, Politics",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

""It met all of our criteria, and more,"" he wrote on a blog chronicling his frustrating dealings with Comcast. ""It had a lovely secluded view of trees, a nice kitchen, and a great home office with a separate entrance."" Morabito made an offer on the house with the understanding that it would be eligible to receive internet service from Comcast. He moved into the home in January. Fast forward to this month, and he's learned the whole internet thing probably isn't happening. His home has no broadband now, and Comcast says that's not going to change. ""I go to the local Starbucks. Their Wi-Fi is great."" The company has outright refused to build out the cabling extension necessary to link Morabito's home to its nearest plant, which is about 2,500 feet away. Admittedly, it wouldn't be a small project; Morabito's own estimates put the cost of installation somewhere between $56,000 and $60,000. He's apparently willing to foot some of that cost, though the initial hope was that Comcast would also chip in to hook up a new customer. But a week ago, he received word that Comcast is simply unwilling to move forward with the install. Apparently it's too much effort and not enough gain for the company, and that's led Morabito to plan an exit from his ""dream house"" sooner than he ever expected. Morabito is adamant that Comcast told him on two separate occasions — before he ever agreed to buy the home — that he'd have no problems getting internet at the address. Clearly that's not happening, and DSL, satellite, and point-to-point connections have also proved impractical. ""I’m living off of a Verizon JetPack mobile hot spot,"" wrote Morabito, who works from home as a software developer. ""When I want to download a big file, like an OS update or a VM image for work, I go to the local Starbucks. Their Wi-Fi is great.""

First, the bad news: for four days in February, the company suffered a breach of its user database, exposing sensitive information to malicious hackers. Slack confirmed to The Verge that databases containing team message history were not accessed as part of the breach. No payment information was exposed, so the main concern is user passwords, which were in encrypted form. The encryption makes it hard for attackers to work back to the original passwords, but it's still an embarrassing breach, and it's difficult to say for sure that the passwords will never be unencrypted. An embarrassing breach But there's also good news. In response to the breach, Slack is rolling out two new security features designed to help teams respond in the aftermath of a breach. The most important is two-factor authentication, available now through the team site, which will ensure the password alone isn't enough to compromise an account. According to Slack, the feature was already in the works, but the breach disclosure convinced the team to move up the launch. ""We were about a week from release, with just a few small UI tweaks to simplify and clarify the usage experience,"" said Vice President of policy Anne Toth. ""We have decided to release it immediately, despite the remaining bits of clunky-ness."" ""We were about a week from release, with just a few small UI tweaks."" Slack is also rolling out a ""password-kill"" feature, which will allow an instant sign-out and password reset for every member of a given team. The feature is meant to allow leaders to flush out their system instantaneously if they suspect a breach. If an attacker is logged on during a password kill, they would be immediately kicked off the system, and unable to log back in without access to team member's email. The legitimate members of the team will have to go through the password-reset process, but it should be a small price to pay for locking any eavesdroppers out of the system. Slack has grown popular among businesses as an email replacement, reaching more than half a million daily users last month, but the growth has come with new concerns over security. In October, the company faced criticism over a bug that allowed outsiders to view the names of different rooms available at a company.

The image of the Mona Lisa was divided up into 150 x 200 pixel sections and then beamed from the Goddard Flight Center up to the LRO at a rate of about 300 bits per second — not exactly the fastest signal out there, but we'll give it credit for managing to transmit data all the way to the moon.

Their findings also show that the ten hottest years over this 132-year period have all occurred since 1998, adding to a growing body of evidence that the world's temperature is rising. The report, published by the Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS), comes just a few days after the US government declared 2012 as the hottest year on record within the lower 48 states. Last year, the world saw an average temperature of 58.3 degrees Fahrenheit, a full degree higher than NASA's mid-20th century baseline average. Since 1880, this average has risen by 1.4 degrees Fahrenheit, with much of this increase coming within the last four decades. ""What matters is this decade is warmer than the last decade, and that decade was warmer than the decade before."" NASA was unequivocal in explaining this trend, citing increased carbon dioxide emissions as the primary driver behind rising temperatures. And while scientists acknowledge that we may see fluctuations over the coming years, they maintain that overarching trends point to an increasingly hot planet. According to NASA, the last time the Earth saw below average temperatures was back in 1976. ""One more year of numbers isn’t in itself significant,"" GISS climatologist Gavin Schmidt said in a statement. ""What matters is this decade is warmer than the last decade, and that decade was warmer than the decade before. The planet is warming. The reason it’s warming is because we are pumping increasing amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere."" The severity of these changes is perhaps best contextualized with a computer simulation that NASA released this week (embedded below). According to NASA GISS director James E. Hansen, these trends should be taken with a sense of urgency, given the impact such extreme climate change can have on the environment and human life. ""The climate dice are now loaded,"" Hansen said. ""Some seasons still will be cooler than the long-term average, but the perceptive person should notice that the frequency of unusually warm extremes is increasing. It is the extremes that have the most impact on people and other life on the planet.""

As the treated cotton gets hotter, it automatically releases ""totally pure water,"" and completely releases all absorbed water as it reaches 34 degrees Celsius.

In a paper published this week, researchers from the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research in Cambridge, Massachusetts found they were able to pinpoint the identities of nearly 50 individuals who had donated genetic information to scientific research. Finding this data wasn't even that hard, requiring only a computer, an internet connection, and publicly available information. “This is an important result that points out the potential for breaches of privacy in genomics studies,"" said Whitehead Fellow Yaniv Erlich, who led the research. Erlich and his team began by analyzing unique information embedded in the Y chromosomes of men who participated in the 1000 Genomes Project — a public catalog of genetic data from a wide range of ethnic groups. The men had donated their genomes under conditions of anonymity, but Whitehead's researchers were able to retrieve their identities by matching their Y chromosome identifiers against publicly available information on family tree websites, obituaries, and demographic databases. ""It only takes one male."" Once they matched a Y chromosome to a surname, they were able to retrieve information on a man's entire family through extensive web searches and queries to the Coriell Institute for Medical Research, a New Jersey-based nonprofit that holds genetic material, ""It only takes one male,'' Erlich told the Wall Street Journal. ""With one male, we can find even distant relatives.'' Erlich added that this technique is most effective for those who participate in genealogy services and websites — typically, middle and upper class white Americans. Such websites are usually used to piece together an individual's family tree, and sometimes couple surnames with Y chromosome data, since this information is passed on from father to son, and can therefore be used to create a generational timeline. Erlich estimates that his method could be used to identify the last names of 12 percent of all US white males participating in similar DNA studies. Scientific organizations have already taken steps to safeguard the identities of DNA donors, though Whitehead's study has raised new questions about whether researchers can ever promise true anonymity in an age where database queries are just a click away. Participants in the 1000 Genomes Project, for instance, were told that the institution would do everything it could to protect their privacy, but that technology may one day make it possible to reveal their full names. David Altshuler, co-chair of the project's steering committee, said that when it comes to anonymity, study participants should be given a range of options. ""If they choose to share that's a very admirable thing because by sharing freely, progress for everyone is accelerated,"" Altshuler told the Journal.

In 2015, it says it will begin sending unmanned ""FireFly"" spacecraft to explore asteroids that fly near Earth, followed by heavier ""DragonFly"" craft that will bring back samples from likely candidates between 2016 and 2020.

The company says a patent is pending, but we're not sure how far along the tech is — though 3D printing has been tried successfully in zero gravity. DSI also promises the same things we've heard from other asteroid mining proponents: if the resources in an asteroid can be successfully recovered, they'll provide things like fuel or metals to current-generation spacecraft.

Unlike the deep-pocketed Planetary Resources, Deep Space Industries is looking for commercial sponsorship In terms of the feasibility of its claims, DSI is roughly on par with Planetary Resources, which announced its own asteroid mining plans in April 2012. Neither company has a proven record like breakout success SpaceX, but nor are their goals as fanciful as the Golden Spike proposal to profitably reach the Moon by 2020. What Deep Space Industries may lack, however, is funding. Planetary Resources was backed by millionaire director James Cameron and Google executives Larry Page and Eric Schmidt among others; DSI hasn't indicated that it has access to pockets nearly so deep, and it's looking for sponsorship for the initial missions.

Church, a geneticist at Harvard Medical School, says he's close to cloning a Neanderthal baby — the first in more than 30,000 years. Speaking to Der Spiegel, Church said that once such cloning technology has matured, all he would need is an ""adventurous female human"" to act as a surrogate. Reviving an extinct human ancestor may seem like a ludicrous premise, but it's not as farfetched as it may seem. Church says he's already extracted enough fossil DNA to reconstruct the DNA of a Neanderthal child, and he's been very outspoken about the feasibility of bringing one to term. There's even a precedent for this breed of genetic resurrection, as well. In 2009, researchers in Spain successfully cloned an extinct subspecies of ibex, though it died just minutes after birth. It's not clear whether Church will be ready to clone a pre-historic human anytime soon, though he says doing so may provide new insight into evolution, while potentially opening new doors for genetic engineering, as well.

Zhang last week admitted to fathering three children with his wife and one child with his ex-wife, following speculation that he had fathered up to seven children with several women. In a statement released last week, the director of House of Flying Daggers and Flowers of War expressed his ""heartfelt apologies"" for violating the law, saying he and his wife were willing to cooperate with an ongoing investigation into the matter. The suit against Zhang was filed on Thursday by two lawyers in the eastern city of Wuxi. The lawyers are seeking 500 million yuan for punitive damages and another 500 million yuan for ""compensation for public resources."" China Daily reports that the lawyers want to use Zhang's case as an example of China's unequal law enforcement, though it remains unclear whether the court will agree to hear the case. ""It's unfair to the poor and those who strictly follow the national policy."" First implemented as a population control measure in 1979, China's policy bars most urban couples from fathering more than one children, though critics have long accused authorities of selectively enforcing it against poorer families, while allowing wealthy couples to circumvent it through relatively small fines. ""The rich have become increasingly audacious by violating the family planning policy just because they are rich enough to pay the fine... and they take an extra share of resources from society,"" Jia Fangyi, one of the lawyers, told China Daily. In a statement, Jia added that the system is ""unfair to the poor and those who strictly follow the national policy."" Zhang, who oversaw the spectacular opening and closing ceremonies at the 2008 Summer Olympic Games in Beijing, has sparked widespread debate over the one-child law in China, with many using his case as an example of why it should be abolished. Last month, the Chinese government announced plans to relax the law, allowing for couples to have two children as long as one of the parents is an only child. Authorities have yet to punish Zhang for his violation, though media reports suggest that he could face a fine of up to 160 million yuan ($26.3 million).",0.8798453557922804,0.1201546442077196,0.8656489425525509,405,4.9506172839506171,237,5.9704641350210972,0,0,"Culture, Entertainment, Policy & Law, US & World",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

A revised version of its licensing policies says that guns like the Liberator, designed by Defense Distributed and released to the world in May, are covered under and forbidden by the Firearms Act 1968 — manufacturing 3D-printed guns or parts is effectively already banned because of rules against manufacturing guns or gun parts except under certain exemptions, but the guidance now includes explicit text to that effect. ""3D printed weapons are potentially lethal barreled weapons and must be viewed as such in law,"" it reads. ""The method of manufacture is not material to this consideration."" In a section of frequently asked questions, regulators say they're still working through the wider implications. ""If someone were to possess, purchase, manufacture or sell a firearm or its component parts otherwise than in accordance with the requirements of sections 1, 3 and 5 of the Firearms Act 1968, they would be liable to prosecution,"" the guidance says. ""We are working closely with our partners, including the police and firearms experts, to assess other implications."" So far, the change is more symbolic, a pushback against Defense Distributed's assertion that affordable printers will make gun control impractical. ""3D-printed guns were illegal before and are still illegal, but we felt it was appropriate to have specifically refer to them in our firearms licensing guide,"" said a spokesperson for the UK Home Office. The UK's decision to add language about 3D-printed guns contrasts with that of US lawmakers, who recently renewed the ""undetectable guns"" law that requires a certain amount of metal in any firearm. While Senator Chuck Schumer (D-NY) promoted his renewal bill by discussing printed guns, the House version of the bill made no changes to the old law and no mention of 3D printing. Schumer has since warned that the House bill doesn't go far enough, leaving a dangerous loophole. ""Under current law, it is legal to make a plastic gun so long as it has some metal in it, even if it is easily removable,"" he said in a statement earlier this week.

Today, the court said it would take on CLS Bank v. Alice Corp., a contentious decision over online trading tools. Next year, it will have to decide whether a handful of patents should be thrown out for cloaking a basic concept in technical terms — or whether doing so would effectively invalidate all software patents. Alice Corporation develops financial software tools, and it promotes its patent portfolio heavily. In that portfolio are four filings for an electronic trading platform that lets a third party manage trading obligations between two other groups — ensuring that one side isn't able to unilaterally back out of the deal. And according to Alice, CLS Bank used the ideas it developed to create its own trading platform. One example, patent 5,970,479 ('479), covers the process of holding ""shadow"" balances for each party in a trade, tallying money until the end of a day and then giving each a net credit or debit. While Alice described it as a concrete software tool, though, CLS argued that this was essentially just the description of escrow, not any kind of actual innovation. ""This case is the death of hundreds of thousands of patents."" Lower courts proved bitterly divided on the issue. Ultimately, judges decided that Alice's patents weren't enforceable and consisted of little more than a basic concept; in a previous trial, a judge had said the system behind them ""is not just abstract; it is also literally ancient"" — pointing to a paper on early Roman trading practices. But a dissenting opinion from Judge Kimberly Moore and others said that if these patents weren't enforceable, virtually no software patents would be. ""If all of these claims, including the system claims, are not patent-eligible, this case is the death of hundreds of thousands of patents, including all business method, financial system, and software patents as well as many computer implemented and telecommunications patents."" The Supreme Court's previous decisions, dissenting judges said, involved patents ""reciting a method and simply saying 'apply it' on a general purpose computer,"" not actual descriptions of software. The Supreme Court dealt with a similar case last year, when it decided WildTangent v. Ultramercial, a dispute over a patent that essentially covered online advertising. In that instance, it sent the case back to the federal courts for review, and the issue now being appealed again. Past cases suggest that Supreme Court judges are willing to rule against patents that outline a specific technical application of an obvious idea, and it seems possible that this decision will fall in line. It's not clear where that would leave software patents as a whole, though it would at the very least make them harder to defend. Software patents have come up again and again in reform efforts, and some judges said that the real issues may be beyond a court's capacity to settle. ""Congress can, and perhaps should, develop special rules for software patents. It could, for instance, limit their life by limiting the term of such patents,"" Judge Richard Lin said in an opinion. ""But broadening what is a narrow exception to the statutory definition of patent eligibility should not be the vehicle to address these concerns. While Congress may, this court may not change the law to address one technological field or the concerns of a single industry.""",0.5043020464709129,0.4956979535290871,0.8898901916758977,573,5.0750436300174524,329,6.0486322188449844,0,0,"Policy & Law, US & World",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

The first Silk Road was suddenly shut down in October when the FBI arrested Ross Ulbricht, the man they claim ran the site under the handle Dread Pirate Roberts. Efforts to relaunch the site began almost immediately, and the new version of the site is a pixel-for-pixel replica. It’s also being run by a person or persons calling themselves Dread Pirate Roberts. Silk Road 2.0 launched on November 6th, making it one month old today. Some of the same sellers returned, and the site already features nearly 3,000 illegal drugs for sale. That’s almost a quarter of the inventory the original site had at the time it was shut down. Exactly how many users have registered on the new Silk Road is hard to say. The new Dread Pirate Roberts did not respond to a request for comment and Libertas, a site admin, declined to be interviewed. Activity on the corresponding Silk Road 2.0 forum, however, suggests the new Silk Road marketplace has fewer than 5 percent of the old site’s user base. The marketplace gives no clues as to how many users are registered. On the forum, however, user profiles are numbered and totaled. Not all Silk Road users post in the forums, and not all forum users have actually made purchases on the Silk Road, but the number of users on each site is probably correlated. There are already nearly 3,000 illegal drugs for sale The old Silk Road forum had 202,095 users, about 21 percent of the 957,079 users the FBI claims were registered on the marketplace. The new forum has almost 9,500 users. Assuming the ratio of forum users to marketplace users is roughly the same as it was before the takedown, the number of registered users on the marketplace is probably around 45,000. That's nothing compared to the first incarnation, which had done $1.2 billion worth of transactions by the time it was brought down. Still, it shows that the community is committed to rebuilding. Buyers and sellers are clearly wary of doing business again so soon after the Silk Road bust. The founders say the new site has more built-in security than the old one, but the FBI’s investigation managed to circumvent any technological precautions. Instead of breaking encryption or hacking into servers, FBI agents posed as vendors and ""turned"" one Silk Road employee into an informant. Based on forum registrations, 5 percent of users have returned The feds also got a copy of the content of Silk Road’s servers from one of its hosting providers overseas simply by asking for it. Police began arresting top dealers soon after the site was brought down and interrogating them about their clients. The investigation proved that much of the security of Silk Road was illusory. Hiding your IP address by using the anonymizing network Tor and the semi-anonymous currency Bitcoin doesn't help if your dealer is in FBI custody. There’s also the common suspicion that the entire site is a honeypot set up by law enforcement. ""Nobody ever assumed that closing Silk Road was going to mean that this was the end,"" says Rusty Payne, a spokesperson for the Drug Enforcement Administration, which participated in the first Silk Road bust. He says the DEA is aware of the new Silk Road and other marketplaces and cautions users to stay away. ""Three months ago I was reading about how these people were untouchable and there was no way to track these guys,"" he tells The Verge. ""Funny how things change."" It doesn't sound like Silk Road is a priority for the agency, however. Payne added that large-scale trafficking, which is the DEA’s first priority, still happens in the real world. A spokesperson for the FBI declined to say whether the agency is aware of or investigating the new Silk Road. Even if the feds aren’t involved, Silk Road 2.0 could still be a setup Even if the feds aren’t involved, Silk Road 2.0 could still be a setup. The people behind the site are of course anonymous. They could shut down the site and run away with users’ bitcoins at any time, which is what seems to have happened at the competing site Sheep Marketplace, where around $100 million worth of bitcoins have disappeared.

Touch the stars ""Wanderers"" comes from Swedish animator and digital artist Erik Wernquist, and it's the product of careful scouring of the NASA archives to piece together realistic portrayals of our neighboring planets. Wernquist has published a detailed explanation of his work that reveals where the inspiration and imagery for each scene came from. (It also includes high-res stills — perfect for your next sci-fi desktop background!). The legendary Carl Sagan narrates the short film — Wernquist pulled an old audio clip of Sagan reading his 1994 book Pale Blue Dot and layered it over the video. We must say, it's a perfect match.

Black people can't be part of the Imperial army, they say, which is dumb for a variety of reasons. But fans should also remember that Scrubs star Donald Faison, another black actor, has been playing Stormtroopers since 2008. This is nothing new, and we should stop acting surprised. Faison happens to be a huge nerd, and also happens to love Star Wars, so it's only natural he turned his fandom into entertainment. He first appeared as Gary the Stormtrooper, an enlisted man and put-upon father, way back in Robot Chicken's second Star Wars special in 2008. Later, he did his own all-LEGO online short series, BlackStormTrooper. If you've never seen it, you should watch it right now:  Now, there are a number of things we don't know going into The Force Awakens. First, we don't know how Disney's new canon will treat the Jango Fett template Stormtroopers and if the remnant of the Empire allows for enlisted humans. We also don't know if, as rumored, Boyega will actually play a Stormtrooper before becoming a Jedi. But, given how huge the franchise is — and how historically lacking it's been in the diversity department — it's worth a reminder that everyone loves these movies. If nothing else, Donald Faison's work proves that this is what Star Wars fandom looks like. Why shouldn't the movies reflect that?

He goes on to say that Apple is a ""dusk empire"" — a metaphor for something which is dying — while the image depicts two contrasting paths for the industry. The outline of the phone in the background with open doors matches leaked images of LeTV's upcoming LeTV X900 smartphone. Admittedly, this sort of ideological criticism is fairly rote when it comes to Apple. Even Google's latest advertising campaign for Android, with its animal odd couples and tagline of ""Be together.

However, there is obviously a world of difference between this type of subtle teasing and the deployment of Nazi imagery to malign your rivals.

The satellite images, embedded below, were taken from the same position in space, 11 days apart; the top photo was captured on January 14th, the bottom on January 3rd. As the images make clear, Beijing has seen increased haze, cloud, and fog coverage over this period, though these formations are far from typical. NASA notes that the region's clouds and fog ""have a tinge of gray or yellow from the air pollution,"" and that even cloudless areas captured on January 14th were blanketed in brown and gray smog, rendering cityscapes all but invisible from space. (For a better before-and-after visualization, see NASA's image comparison tool here.)   Perhaps most terrifying, though, is the fact that NASA's images weren't even taken at the height of China's smog crisis. When the January 14th photo was captured, Beijing's air quality index (AQI) stood at 341 — well above the 300 AQI threshold at which air is considered to be hazardous to all humans, but far below the city's high point. Conditions reached a nadir, in fact, on January 12th, when the AQI in Beijing reached a staggering 775. According to independent air quality monitors at the US Embassy, PM2.5 particle pollution readings in Beijing over the weekend were literally ""beyond index."" In the past, the Chinese government has been reluctant to even acknowledge its air pollution problem; authorities only began releasing data on dangerous pollutants early last year. This crisis, however, has forced the government to take action, ordering factories to reduce emissions and spraying water at industrial buildings to help contain the haze that has engulfed the region. Schools, meanwhile, were ordered to suspend outdoor activities, as the government urged citizens to ""take measures to protect their health.""

The category until now has been dominated by a few success stories — Fitbit, FuelBand, and so on — and true to CES form we're seeing a lot more companies attempting to cash in. After all, ""people in America, frankly, are really fat"" as Fitbit CEO James Park told The Verge in an interview yesterday; the obesity problem has been a hot-button issue for decades, and companies and startups are now attempting to leverage the rise of smartphones to capitalize on the epidemic. According to Travis Bogard, VP of product for Jawbone which produces the Up fitness band, these devices make sense because ""people know more about their iPhones than their health."" But the majority of new products we've seen at this year's show have been me-too attempts bringing little to the table. What's the future of these devices — exciting new paradigm in personal data, or evolutionary dead end? ""People in America, frankly, are really fat."" The majority of these products are glorified pedometers. A simple accelerometer measures your movements with a fairly high degree of accuracy, but the magic happens in software; the data is synced to apps which convert it into useful information about the user's lifestyle, offering a picture of their activity over time. The differences between major competitors are mostly superficial. Fitbit makes tiny clip-on Bluetooth devices that track steps and sleep patterns, and just announced the wristband-style Flex. Jawbone's Up does the same thing, syncing with an iPhone via a physical plug. Nike's FuelBand is much the same, but loses the sleep-tracking functionality in favor of a dot matrix display and Bluetooth connectivity. All have mobile apps that convert the data into attractive graphs and charts. Are they cool? Sure. Are they unique ideas? Not in the slightest. Cool? Sure. Unique? No. For the most part, the new devices announced at CES this year haven't done a lot to shake things up. Fitbug's Orb looks very similar to Fitbit, but told us that it aims to compete on price and with an enterprise-focused business model. Withings, an early leader in the field with its Bodyscale, showed the Fitbit-style Smart Activity Tracker to get its users out of the house. Perhaps the most egregious example of overzealous flattery comes from LG, whose Smart Activity Tracker has the exact same name as Withings' new product and looks almost identical to the FuelBand.  There were glimmers of innovation on the show floor. BodyMedia is aiming to compete based on more accurate and comprehensive sensing technology, with several components combining to capture over 5,000 data points per minute. Hapilabs' bizarre Hapifork applies the fitness-tracking blueprint to another area of health by measuring how often you eat and telling you when you're doing it too much. Both products are cool, but neither seems likely to take over the space — their focus and appeal are narrowed, not broadened. Instead, what we're seeing is a maturation of the category. With Fitbit's Flex, the industry appears to be crystallizing around wristbands as the most convenient form factor; in yesterday's Verge interview, Fitbit CEO James Park said that one reason behind the company's shift to a wristband device was that ""some people like to show off the fact that they're tracking their fitness and becoming more healthy."" Jawbone VP of product Travis Bogard, meanwhile, told us that the wrist is a ""interesting place"" that allows for a lot of flexibility in data gleaned from the Up. It also makes for an unobtrusive and comfortable design that lets users essentially forget about having to wear it. ""No-one wants to wear a computer."" That's not to say that it's been perfected. While Jawbone places a lot of emphasis on Yves Behar's sleek design for the Up, saying ""no-one wants to wear a computer,"" Bogard admitted that the company would ""love to make it smaller."" He told me that if adding new technology would decrease the band's battery life or balloon its size, Jawbone probably wouldn't want to do it. James Park, meanwhile, says that there are a lot of areas Fitbit could move into in the future in terms of what data to track - blood pressure, stress, deeper sleep, and heartbeat were all called out as potential new avenues. From speaking to Park and Bogard, however, it seems that we're unlikely to see much in the way of radical new changes to the fitness-tracking experience any time soon.  And that's been borne out on the CES show floor, where there are a huge number of gadgets that track similar data in similar ways. How can the big guns hope to differentiate themselves? Jawbone tried to set the Up apart with some of its unique features like the 30-minute vibration alert for when you're not moving, arguing that ""it's not just about data,"" but it's clear that software is a major part of the equation. One of Fitbit's main selling points is the API that hooks into products from other companies such as Withings — all designed to get users more deeply entwined in the ecosystem and ultimately sell more devices, of course. Jawbone's app has seen a dramatic improvement since the first Up's aborted launch, too, and it probably offers the slickest experience of any product to date. Of course, a major selling point for just about any of these products is their software ecosystem, with your data often locked to one company's output forever. These products are extraordinarily easy to copy Ultimately, the key feature of these devices may not be what they do, but what they don't do. Bogard told me that Jawbone constantly asks itself ""How do we dumb this down?"" to make it as easy as possible for users to learn about themselves, and Park sees Fitbit in a similar light; ""You want to make things simple,"" he told The Verge yesterday. The problem with this approach, as we've seen at CES this week, is that it's extraordinarily easy to copy. With new companies sure to flood the market with copycat products over the upcoming year, and incumbent leaders largely happy with where they're at in terms of hardware innovation, the future of the category is anyone's guess. Right now, fitness devices remind us of nothing as much as the pre-2007 smartphone — a few people thought they were cool to use, but it took one product to break through and make the entire category relevant to a mainstream audience. And, given the limited functionality of the current devices, we expect that inevitable product to be as different to what we see today as the iPhone was to its contemporaries. Maybe a smartwatch could be it; this CES gave us our first look at the finished Pebble, which looks like one of the biggest advances yet in one of the oldest wearable technologies. But then again, no-one really did predict the iPhone.",0.48415797654421694,0.515842023455783,0.15986058922676283,1177,4.9048428207306713,600,6.1399999999999997,0,0,"Science, CES 2013, Report",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The New Republic Jeet Heer charts a history of racism at The New Republic, noting the ways in which its perceived liberalism has been used to mask its questionable politics. Over the last few months, following The New Republic’s centenary anniversary and a staff shake-up, a perceived legacy of racism in the magazine has been the topic of intense arguments, mostly carried out online.

Its fifth album, The Fall, came out in 2011. Following that release, the band went on hiatus, though disagreements between Albarn and Hewlett are said to have begun during work on 2009's Plastic Beach. In the past couple of years, Albarn has hinted in interviews that the two could reunite Gorillaz, and with the new artwork from Hewlett, it's safe to say that the two have settled their differences.  #Noodle  A photo posted by hewll (@hewll) on Jan 30, 2015 at 10:24am PST",0.8373058971217153,0.16269410287828467,0.8637870035813138,182,4.813186813186813,121,5.3719008264462813,0,0,Culture,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Even if something is labeled ""native advertising"" or ""sponsored content,"" its placement or writing style can lead people to believe it's part of the rest of the site. In a daylong workshop yesterday, the agency questioned where to draw the line, and as The New York Times reports, there isn't necessarily a clear answer. ""The market has overwhelmingly blurred the lines in a way consumers have accepted."" Participants in the workshop (called, naturally, ""Blurred Lines"") touched on the practices of several sites known for their sponsored content or native advertising, including Mashable, The Huffington Post, and BuzzFeed. On the Media co-host Bob Garfield took a hard line against most sponsored ads and raised one of the most controversial examples: an Atlantic post that appeared to be a glowing news piece on Scientology but was in fact written and sponsored by the church itself. Like the advertorials of print media, it's not necessarily obvious that a piece is sponsored, nor whether it's an independently written piece or one guided by the needs of advertisers. ""By presenting ads that resemble editorial content, an advertiser risks implying, deceptively, that the information comes from a nonbiased source,"" said FTC chair Edith Ramirez. The FTC has previously taken on Twitter ads, telling companies that they needed to include clarifications like ""Ad"" in celebrity endorsements and refrain from giving any misleading information, even if it was included in a followup tweet. Here, the agency doesn't seem to have settled on an answer. FTC tests have affirmed the common wisdom that advertisers would rather use the term ""sponsored"" than directly label an ad, but the question remains whether the word confuses readers.— and whether it does so in a way that gives advertisers an unfair boost. Professor David Franklyn of the University of San Francisco School of Law said that early research showed many consumers couldn't identify clearly marked advertisements, and half didn't even know what ""sponsored"" meant. ""The market has overwhelmingly blurred the lines in a way consumers have accepted because search is free and the internet is largely free,"" he said, as quoted in AdWeek.

Rep. Bob Goodlatte's (R-VA) Innovation Act passed committee in November and reached the House floor today, where it was approved in a vote of 325 to 91. It has gained wide support both in and outside Congress: the White House officially backed Goodlatte's legislation earlier this week and in fact proposed several of its elements in June, and a host of tech companies and venture capitalists, including Google, have thrown their weight behind it. The Patent Transparency and Improvements Act, a companion bill from Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT), was introduced in November. That bill is still in committee, but with significant momentum around the issue, it's likely to do well. The Innovation Act is aimed at keeping the effective structure of the patent system in place but reducing the incentives to send frivolous complaints, cutting down on the alleged billions of dollars of damage done by them, but not everyone agreed it would have the right effect. Groups like the National Small Business Association argue that it places an unfairly high burden on patent holders, making it too difficult for small businesses or individual inventors — rather than large companies — to protect their patents. The NSBA expressed consternation at the ""alarming rate"" at which patent troll legislation has moved forward: Goodlatte's bill was introduced less than two months ago. Some universities, which develop and license patents but do not build commercial products, also say that the bill's scope is too broad and would hurt their ability to make money from research, and Qualcomm CEO Paul Jacobs said the ""point of view of the inventor"" was missing from the debate. Goodlatte's bill raises the bar and the stakes for patent claims Goodlatte's bill raises the bar for sending a patent infringement letter and raises the stakes for filing and losing a case, making it harder for trolls to send vague letters to companies that would face higher costs from going to court than settling. Under the Innovation Act, a patent complaint needs to list which patents and parts of patents are being infringed and name the offending products or processes, among other things. The potentially lengthy and expensive discovery process in a suit will be held until after a court has interpreted what the patent covers, and if a plaintiff loses, they'll have to pay court costs. The bill will be most effective against indiscriminate bulk filers, who send letters to both producers and consumers of technology claiming ownership of basic techniques like scanning and emailing a document. Legal scholar Brian Love has said that larger trolls who are willing to take select cases to court won't be deterred as easily, and two major offenders, Intellectual Ventures and IP Nav, have expressed tentative support or mixed feelings for the bill, not outright opposition. While the legislation moves forward, the FTC is conducting its own work on reducing patent troll lawsuits. Earlier this year, it opened a fact-finding investigation into the structure of patent assertion entities, which often operate through webs of shell companies that make it hard to hold them responsible if they make frivolous claims. So far, though, its actual ability to crack down on trolls has remained unclear, and Goodlatte's bill is a concrete move against one of the most hated groups in tech.",0.4989310927829538,0.5010689072170462,0.6696323156377829,565,5.1592920353982299,330,6.1333333333333337,0,0,"Policy & Law, US & World, Politics",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

Clinton's sketches are no match for the self-portrait painted by his successor, but they still provide a fun peek at his attempts to overcome boredom or pass the time while entrenched in lengthy Oval Office meetings.

Through a memorandum, Obama ordered the government to more than double its current reliance on renewable energy by 2020. If the goal is met, at least 20 percent of the government's energy will come from renewable sources by then, with that number slowly rising up beginning with a minimum of 10 percent in 2015.  The goal is to use 20 percent renewable energy by 2020 Combating climate change and reducing the government's reliance on non-renewable energy have been ongoing goals for the president. The federal government has already reduced its greenhouse gas emissions by 15 percent from 2008 levels, and it's currently receiving over 7 percent of its energy from renewable sources. Not everyone agrees that Obama's recent plans to fix climate change will work, but the administration appears to be pleased with its successes so far. ""Agencies are already well on their way towards meeting the aggressive sustainability goals set forth in [a 2009 executive order],"" Obama writes in the memorandum. The goal is to spur the economy through reliance on clean energy, which Obama says will have a laundry list of benefits for the country, including, among other: fighting climate change, promoting energy security, and protecting the environment.

Known throughout the globe for his role in dismantling the South African apartheid regime, Mandela had been treated for a persistent lung infection earlier this year, and in recent days had retreated to his Johannesburg home. ""He is now resting,"" South African President Jacob Zuma said. ""He is now at peace."" ""It is an ideal for which I am prepared to die."" Mandela began as an activist with the African National Congress, arranging general strikes and ""Defiance Campaigns"" in protest of the policies of apartheid. After a string of arrests and increasingly violent police crackdowns, Mandela was arrested in 1963 on charges of sabotage, and for plotting the violent overthrow of the government. At his trial, Mandela admitted to sabotage and some acts of violence, but insisted it was towards the goal of a free and equitable society. ""I have cherished the ideal of a democratic and free society in which all persons live together in harmony and with equal opportunities,"" Mandela told the court. ""It is an ideal which I hope to live for and to achieve. But if needs be, it is an ideal for which I am prepared to die."" Amid fears of a Communist uprising, he was sentenced to life in prison. ""So long as I live, I will do what I can to learn from him."" As global outrage over Apartheid grew, Mandela gained global prominence as a political prisoner, kept for 18 years in an 8-by-7-foot cell in South Africa's Robben Island prison. In 1990, Mandela was released and immediately became one of the country's most powerful political figures. Shortly after his release, he gave a speech to a crowd of more than 100,000 at Johannesburg's Soccer City, calling for an end to the politics of racial supremacy which had defined the nation. ""We call on our white compatriots to join us in the shaping of a new South Africa."" In 1994, he was elected president of South Africa, serving until he withdrew from politics in 1999. In the wake of his death, world leaders have lined up to mourn Mandela. In a speech to the nation, South African President Zuma called upon South Africans to celebrate Mandela's life by renewing their commitment to social justice. ""Let us recall the values for which Madiba fought,"" Zuma said, using Mandela's colloquial nickname. ""Let us reaffirm his vision of a society in which none is exploited, oppressed or dispossessed by another."" US President Barack Obama also commented on Mandela's passing in a public address.

In fact, we still got a bunch of great trailers this week — in particular, a first glimpse at Jurassic World and some new looks at a couple big comedies. Head down below to see seven of the best that came out this week.   No description needed. The first trailer for The Force Awakens is here, and it looks amazing. Go watch it if you haven't already. And if you have, maybe just watch it again.   Say what you will about a genetically modified dinosaur, but the first trailer for Jurassic World actually looks pretty cool. More than ever, it's turning into a straight monster movie, and that sounds like a pretty great way to continue this franchise. The movie comes out on June 12th.   The final trailer for Seth Rogen and James Franco's The Interview looks appropriately ridiculous for a film about the two of them attempting to assassinate Kim Jong-Un. It's a goofy comedy, but with the subject matter, it pretty much has to be. It'll be released on Christmas.   This could turn out to be a pretty fun adventure. Pan offers an origin story for J.M. Barrie's classic character, showing Peter's first trip into Neverland and some incredibly colorful landscapes. The movie has some great stars on board, including Hugh Jackman, who plays an appropriately creepy Blackbeard. It'll be out on July 17th and is playing in 3D.   Don't take this film's exceedingly bland name the wrong way. Kingsman isn't another generic action flick; it's a totally over-the-top spy comedy that knows all the tropes and decides to have some fun with them. It stars Colin Firth and also has Michael Caine and Samuel L. Jackson. It'll be out in the UK on January 29th and in the US a few weeks later.   George Lucas is behind the story for Strange Magic, a fairy-tale musical that's coming out on January 23rd. It's an animated film that's definitely aimed at kids, but it's clearly meant to be an eccentric and fun one — the movie looks like it's filled with upbeat, classic hits that have somehow invaded its strange world.   Chris Rock's Top Five seems to be winning over everyone who sees it. The film is about an actor trying to recover his career, but it also seems like it leaves things simple enough to give Rock and his incredible costars plenty of room to play around. It'll be out on December 12th.   It's definitely a kids movie, but Home still looks like a nice spin on an alien invasion. Plus, it has Rihanna voicing its hero.

That's understandable enough; most of us are either out shopping or still in bed, recovering from last night's Thanksgiving dinner. But when Disney opts to tease the upcoming Star Wars film in just a handful of theaters, you'd expect more than a few superfans waiting in line for a chance to see the Millennium Falcon again. But that's not what happened. At 9:00 in the morning on what might be the biggest day for the franchise in years, most of New York City's Star Wars fans stayed home. No superfans. Just would-be straphangers and tired families. The trailer was supposed to play in front of a 9:30AM showing of The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part I at the AMC theater on the Upper West Side, so we got to our seats at about 9:25AM. We should have been embarrassingly late, but the theater was mostly deserted. No security to speak of. No one in Imperial regalia. Just a couple of would-be straphangers and tired families. Lew, one of the few people sitting behind me, wasn't hopeful when I asked if he expected more people to show up. ""I mean, it's Black Friday in the morning,"" he said. ""Probably not."" He'd come for the teaser, but also because he wanted to see Mockingjay. Why not kill two birds with one stone? New Yorkers don't give a shit about Star Wars  That was the feeling that pervaded the entire experience: that this was just unessential, especially when the trailer would premiere online in under an hour. The internet has changed the very essence of fandom. The Hollywood Reporter writes that back in 1998, the teaser for The Phantom Menace created a ""near-hysterical"" reaction among fans. Today, crickets. When the AMC commercials ended, we sat waiting in 20 minutes of almost-silence. But there was no frisson of expectation. We just... waited. I daydreamed about heading home and taking a nap. Two theatergoers nearby discussed the merits of the iPhone 6. ""It's just bigger,"" one said. ""What's the point?"" I thought I could ask the same about our being there, but it seems the West Coast was having a better go of it. These are real @starwars geeks -- my people pic.twitter.com/4xMNRX7F1q  I'm jealous. We kept right on waiting, but the biggest reaction we got was when the trailer never came on. A few confused murmurs echoed through the crowd, but just a few of us — ourselves included — left outright. One audience member asked the staff what happened, and they were just as confused as we were. ""Star Wars trailer?"" she asked. It might as well have been the first time she'd heard Disney had something planned, even though the teaser would play in front of every movie over the weekend. Eventually we walked into the next available auditorium, never mind what film was playing (it might have been Penguins of Madagascar) and waited all over again. I could feel the excitement just fine from my phone Then we saw it. And it was awesome. I admitted audibly that I wanted that lightsaber. And then we left, my euphoria draining away because there was really no one to share it with. The funny thing was, the internet promptly blew up when the trailer premiered on iTunes and YouTube, and I could feel the excitement scrolling through Twitter on my phone. That's where New York fandom went this morning. Not a sleepy theater in Manhattan.

In The Kingdom of Dreams and Madness, a compelling documentary by Mami Sunada that sees release in New York this week, Miyazaki largely comes off well as a polite, diligent worker blessed with a stroke of genius. But the man is also marked by moments of cynicism, resentment, and self-doubt that hint at a darkness behind his creations. “I don’t ever feel happy in my daily life,” he says. “How could that be our ultimate goal? Filmmaking only brings suffering.” The Kingdom of Dreams and Madness focuses on Miyazaki as he works on The Wind Rises, a soaring, personal epic that he later announced would be his final feature film. In the background is his colleague and rival, Isao Takahata, who is planning to release the ethereal Tale of the Princess Kaguya on the same day as Miyazaki’s movie. The pair founded Studio Ghibli after Takahata took on Miyazaki as an apprentice; for a while they worked on animations together, but the younger Miyazaki wanted to direct his own features and soon became the bigger star. Despite worldwide acclaim and his status as perhaps the greatest living animator, Miyazaki doesn’t express much confidence or even affection for his work. ""How do we know movies are even worthwhile?,"" he asks at one point. ""How did this happen? What am I doing with this film?"" at another. When asked about the future of Studio Ghibli, which has been the subject of much speculation in recent years, his answer is blunt. ""The future is clear: it's going to fall apart,"" he says. ""I can already see it. What's the use worrying? It's inevitable."" Takahata is a ghostly presence throughout the film until a brief appearance near the end. Miyazaki doesn’t hold back on his colleague, accusing him of having a personality disorder and leaving the studio in disarray. When announcing Princess Kaguya for the first time, producer Toshio Suzuki admits to reporters that Takahata has ""never delivered a film on time or on budget,"" already knowing that the movie won’t make the release date he’s giving. ""Takahata-san is incomprehensible. Does he not want to finish?"" Suzuki later asks in exasperation. Sunada expertly weaves the relationship between the two directors throughout The Kingdom of Dreams and Madness, playing the two off each other to spin an absorbing narrative. The documentary is invaluable as a record of what goes on inside Ghibli's walls. Staff talk about how hard it can be to work under Miyazaki, but the footage of him working on storyboards, selecting and instructing voice actors, and advising artists on exactly how to convey his intended feeling shows just how astute and meticulous a director he is. I’ve often found that Miyazaki and Takahata’s films have the capability to move me more than just about any others, and it’s fascinating to get insight into the sometimes torturous process with which they achieve that. That said, The Kingdom of Dreams and Madness may not hold much appeal for those unfamiliar with Studio Ghibli’s filmography. Its two-hour running time, matter-of-fact cinematography, and frequent delves into the esoteric assume some degree of knowledge regarding the subject matter, and often regarding Japan itself. Sunada even made the brave decision not to show any of Miyazaki’s animation whatsoever beyond a short montage in the closing moments. But that delayed release more than pays off. Set to Miyazaki’s pensive words made minutes before walking on stage to announce his retirement, it’s an emotional gut punch on par with anything from the director himself. The Kingdom of Dreams and Madness should be considered essential viewing for any Studio Ghibli fan, for whom it will stand alone as a captivating work in its own right. The Kingdom of Dreams and Madness opens today at the IFC Center in New York City. It’ll be made available for download on December 9th before a DVD and video-on-demand release on January 27th.",0.8559534423092359,0.14404655769076413,0.17054008283372815,693,5.0923520923520922,410,6.1121951219512196,0,8,"Culture, Entertainment, Movie Review, Review",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

The teaser trailer runs 88-seconds long and is available to watch online and in theaters starting today. Here's all you need to know: it looks really, really good. The trailer gives a first glimpse at a lot of the new and returning stars, but it also shows just how great a job director J.J. Abrams' appears to have done in putting back together the Star Wars universe. A great score from John Williams elevates that even further. This isn't much for now, but it ought to get fans' hopes way up. While this is only a short glimpse at The Force Awakens, this is the first look that we've gotten at all. That's partly because Disney has been incredibly secretive about the production of Episode VII, but it's also for a much simpler reason: the movie still isn't done. Filming wrapped at the beginning of the month, but the movie is still a long way from completion. That'll be especially true for its special-effects shots, which are likely far from complete at this point — and certainly not at a stage where most can be shown off.  The film is still a year away This teaser is more about getting fans excited and putting Star Wars back on everyone's radar than about actually introducing this new film. There's a lot more to see — and we certainly will — but there's still a ways to go before the film comes out next year on December 18th.

The galaxy George Lucas had dreamed up took form in the original movies, but it was populated and fully realized by the authors, artists, and video game developers that helped build Star Wars' back stories. Now, like a blaster taken to my childhood memories, that Expanded Universe was gone. I thought the damage would be permanent. But I've just seen the Star Wars: The Force Awakens trailer. I've seen it, and I want to go back to the galaxy far, far away right now. I don't mind that Luke won't ever meet Mara, I don't mind that the Yuuzhan Vong are scrubbed from existence. I don't even care that this is now a universe that will potentially never feature cybernetically advanced Ewok pilot Lieutenant Kettch. The trailer shows that the new movie still has the symbols of the soul of Star Wars — X-Wings and TIE fighters and the Millennium Falcon thrown into frenetic aerial dog fights.  With The Force Awakens, Star Wars has something new for a galaxy that was all but mapped out across 35 years of filler material — it has mystery again.   Warning: I'll be talking at length about the Expanded Universe lore and various film rumors, which might be considered spoilers. Who is John Boyega's unnamed character, springing from out of shot at the beginning of the 88-second teaser, and why is he wearing stormtrooper armor? Is he an Imperial deserter? Or has he pulled a Han Solo and borrowed a set of the iconic white coverings to pass as a member of the military? Script leaks have suggested the former, but that raises the question of his birth. Republic troops in Star Wars Episodes II and III were clones, fighting in the titular clone wars, but old Ben Kenobi's reference to the conflict in Episode IV suggests that practice has changed, and new troopers are recruited from the populace. In the Expanded Universe, many of these recruits were trained on the high-gravity world of Carida, a planet destroyed some 11 years after the battle of Yavin by moody teenage jedi Kyp Durron. If Boyega's character is one of these recruits, how did he end up on this desert planet that's probably Tatooine? Are the troopers in the shuttle shown in the next shot chasing him? But more importantly, how do stormtroopers still exist? The end of Return of the Jedi shows — in addition to the bangingest Ewok dance party Endor's ever seen — a montage of celebratory shots signaling the apparent end of the Empire. After the emperor's death at the robot hands of angry daddy Darth Vader, are stormtroopers still Imperial stormtroopers? Have they been co-opted into a new government's military structure? If so, why did they not change their super-evil hats? You'd think those would be the first things to go with a regime change. Perhaps some remnant of the Empire clings on, and that the Rebel Alliance's victory in the Endor system was not as absolute as Wicket W. Warrick's wild gyrations would have had us believe. This question is compounded by the Rebel logo still plastered on the X-Wing pilots' helmets. This could show that the Rebel Alliance is still a concern some 30 years after the destruction of the second Death Star, with battles to fight that require the deployment of starfighters — starfighters, it should be noted, that are three decades old. In the Expanded Universe, X-Wing manufacturer Incom planned to replace the venerable snubfighter with a new, more nimble E-Wing some six years after Endor. Why is the organization that unseated the Empire flying around in aging tin cans? And why can't its pilots afford new helmets? The 30-year gap between Episode VI and VII has at least advanced droid tech to the point that the newest astromech droids can roll around like cute little soccer balls (I'm placing a 10 dollar bet now that someone kicks one and it squawks like R2-D2), but the landspeeder shown some 38 seconds into the teaser looks decidedly low-tech. The speeder, driven by The Force Awakens star Daisy Ridley, looks closer in appearance to a GNK ""Gonk"" power droid than Luke's sleek X-34 model. According to rumors reported by SlashFilm, Ridley's playing a Skywalker-esque figure called Kira, trapped on a desert planet and yearning for excitement and adventure.     That's presumably a Sith wielding a distinctive (and already much-mocked) lightsaber. The black robes and red saber color give the game away, but note also the length of the hilt. It's long enough for the wielder to grip with two hands, giving them the powerful swinging style used by noted dark siders Darth Vader and Desann, the dinosaur-ish final boss of Jedi Knight II. Also consider the length of the man carrying it — the long limbs and notable stoop could show that this is actor Adam Driver, tipped to play the movie's main villain. For now, the trailer Sith's motives aren't clear, but if he's anything like every other Sith in (fake) history, he'll either want to kill the movie's heroes or turn them to the dark side. That leaves the short teaser to close with something more instantly recognizable. As the Millennium Falcon veers into stomach-churning turns to escape from TIE fighters over the surface of the desert planet, look closely at the topside of its hull. The Falcon's round radar dish, knocked off during the escape from the second Death Star, has been replaced by a rectangular model. A little nod to fans, no doubt, by a director who is certainly no stranger to fan service. But this trailer also shows that Abrams is no stranger to Star Wars. Lucasfilm and Disney might have swept the old history away, sure, but in 88 short seconds, the director has injected excitement back into the void left by its removal. Star Wars is simple in tone, a Saturday matinee about titanic and easily sketched conflicts between light and dark. But it's also about filling out this conflict, fleshing it out with strange planets, weird aliens, and characters caught up in the struggle. After watching this trailer, for the first time since the universe was destroyed, I can't wait to get back to the galaxy far, far away.

The trouble is, it isn't always obvious what good films have made their way onto the service just by browsing around. We've taken a look through the past few months' additions to pick out 12 movies — some new, some classics — that are worth watching if you haven't gotten around to them yet.   Forget about the recent remake by re-watching the original. Total Recall has a lot of action, some classic Philip K. Dick sci-fi, and plenty of awesome visual effects. Plus, it has Arnold Schwarzenegger at the top of his acting game.  If you caught the trailer for Mad Max: Fury Road earlier this year, then you should understand why you'd want to watch the original if you haven't seen it yet. It's one of the classic dystopias, and — of course — it has some awesome car stunts.  One of this year's wildest films takes place entirely on an apocalyptic train ride. Snowpiercer is about a rebellion from the lowest class in a dystopian world, who find themselves fighting their way through a futuristic train as they try to get from the back all the way to the front.      If you plan on catching Mockingjay soon, you may just want a refresher. Catching Fire is as good, if not better, than the first Hunger Games, and it has plenty of action and visual flair to make it worth revisiting.      It's everything you want from Quentin Tarantino: stylish, smart, and super bloody. Django Unchained is his first western, and with Jamie Foxx, Christoph Waltz, and Leonardo DiCaprio starring, he puts together a pretty incredible tale.   In the mood for an epic? Braveheart hit Netflix earlier this month, so there's your answer. Just be sure to set aside the time for it — it runs just shy of three hours.  There's no explanation needed here. As of this month, Airplane! is available to stream on Netflix, and that's good news for comedy fans.  Silver Linings Playbook received a ton of Oscar nominations a couple years back, including for best picture. It didn't win most of those, but it's still a widely well-received film that's supposed to be a lot more interesting than the average rom-com.   Galaxy Quest is both a fun send-up of sci-fi and a fun sci-fi adventure in its own right. It's a parody of Star Trek, fandom, and ridiculous TV that should be a funny watch even if you've never seen an episode of what it's poking fun of.   This is actually a super fun movie. The film has Jack Black pretending to be a teacher so that he can make some money and turn a bunch of music students into the perfect bandmates. Hilarity and some sweet music ensues. It's directed by Richard Linklater, who's dealt with student life in films like Dazed and Confused and Boyhood too.   It's probably safe to assume that you've seen Cool Runnings, so this is more of a heads up: if you want to watch Cool Runnings again, now's your chance. It's been back on Netflix since September.      It's hard to rank Robin Williams' best films, but many would say that Good Morning, Vietnam is way up there. It's a war comedy that gives Williams the privilege of sitting in front of a microphone and just running with it — and that's a premise that's pretty hard to argue with.

Additionally, customers in the US will be able to pre-order the phones starting tomorrow, March 27th, with certain AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile, Verizon Wireless, U.S. Cellular, and Best Buy locations having the phones on hand for in-person demos starting tomorrow. Update: Read the review of the Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge. The Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge coming to the US will largely be the same as the model available globally. They have 5.1-inch, qHD Super AMOLED displays, 32, 64, or 128GB of internal storage, Samsung's octacore Exynos processors, and 16-megapixel cameras with optical image stabilization. Unfortunately, US customers will only be able to choose from black, white, or gold color options — the striking emerald green S6 Edge and navy blue S6 are not coming to the US, at least not at this time. AT&T has listed pricing in a blog post, but oddly (and annoyingly) only on its Next installment plans. The 32GB version of the Galaxy S6 starts at $22.84 per month for 30 months on AT&T's Next 24 plan, which works out to about a $685.20 off-contract price. The Galaxy S6 Edge is $27.17 per month for 30 months, which makes the Edge about $130 more for the off-contract price. T-Mobile is charging roughly the same for the Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge: the former will run $28.33 per month on a 24 month plan, while the latter will cost $32.49 per month for the same time span. That works out to $679.92 and $779.76, respectively. However, T-Mobile is sweetening the deal with a free year of Netflix, which is worth $107.88 on its own, making it pretty attractive if you're already a Netflix subscriber. If those plans don't have you confused, Sprint's options might. The carrier is offering the Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge through its leasing plans, which pair the 32GB S6 with unlimited talk, text, and data for $80 per month. Upgrading to a 64GB or 128GB model will cost $5 or $10 more per month, respectively. If you're interested in the S6 Edge, leasing plans will cost about $5 more per month across the board. Sprint's plans are different from the other carriers in that you don't actually own the phone after two years — your only option is to surrender it for a new device or keep paying in perpetuity. Fortunately, Sprint's prepaid brand Boost is a little more straightforward: a 32GB Galaxy S6 will cost $649.99. Boost is not offering the S6 Edge. Verizon won't actually accept pre-orders until April 1st. According to CNET, Verizon will offer the S6 for $200 after rebate with a new contract, or for $24.99 per month for 24 months. The S6 Edge will be $300 with a two-year contract, or $29.16 per month for the same 24 months. Full retail pricing is $600 for the S6 and $700 for the S6 Edge. Update: This article has been updated to clarify that AT&T's pricing is based on 30 installments, not 24. We regret the error.

Apple has integrated iCloud relatively seamlessly throughout iOS, so many people are using it without even knowing it. Google can do the same with Drive on Android. And while Dropbox isn't default to any platform, it's almost become the de facto integration for many apps because of how widely used it is. Amazon doesn't have any of that (unless you're on a Kindle Fire), which largely makes this siloed off storage. That'll be fine for many, but it's not optimal and not where cloud storage is headed.

I have to start this review with a brief confession: I don’t really know any of my colleagues. I started working at The Verge in December last year, but as I live in London, I’ve only ever met the members of our UK team. All two of them. There’s been a few group Skype calls with the New York and San Francisco offices, but for the most part I either talk to people on Slack or over email. This isn’t unusual for a job in the media of course, but my bosses decided that it was time for me to get a little more involved. To have some of that good old-fashioned human interaction. Their solution? They gave me a robot, of course.   Meet my Double, a telepresence bot from Double Robotics that combines the fun of a remote-controlled car with the thrill of videoconferencing. It’s best described as an iPad on a Segway because, well, that’s basically what it is. There is a pair of squat wheels at the bottom and a telescoping pole that extends from three feet to five feet tall. At the top of this, there’s a jig for an iPad (sold separately unfortunately), and the whole arrangement is self-balancing. You log in like a Skype call — either via a mobile app or website — and then you're presented with controls to move the bot around, while a loudspeaker attachment lets you sound your barbaric yawp over the cubicles of the world.   At least, that’s the theory. The first time I actually logged in to the robot, no one even noticed me appear. Sure, anyone glancing around the office might have seen my slightly quizzical face pop into existence in midair, but the whole thing was really discrete. This wasn’t like getting suited up in Pacific Rim; I just clicked a couple of buttons, and there I was, operating a robot. I looked around at first but everyone was busy working. Someone at the other end of the office caught my eye, but by the time the video had registered my hasty smile they’d looked away. I tried saying hello, but it turned out the speakers on the bot weren’t working (we eventually had to get a replacement), and I was left on the wall, quietly nodding to myself like the most boring painting in Hogwarts. In the end, I had to settle for messaging the person nearest to me on Slack. So much for the personal touch.   This is one of the problems with telepresence: it’s been around for years, but it’s still not clear why anyone needs to use it. Companies like Double say they offer ""a physical presence at work or school when you can’t be there in person,"" but for most office jobs this is unnecessary anyway — a combination of video calls, email, and online software like Google Docs is all you need to work from home. Meanwhile, anyone in a profession which does depend on their physical presence will know that even the world’s most advanced robots are laughably inadequate when it comes to things like physical dexterity. It doesn’t help that telepresence bots are temperamental and expensive. Even the relatively simple Double costs $2,499, and that's without buying an iPad to actually make it work. Despite this lack of an obvious use case, there’s something undeniably attractive about the idea of being able to be physically elsewhere. Telepresence bots are being sold to hospitals, for example, to let doctors do the rounds remotely (although there’s no concrete data on how frequently these robots are actually used). This same level of interaction could also be achieved if the nurse simply carried a laptop with them, but I imagine there’s something vaguely reassuring for patients if the doctors seem in control. Ken Goldberg, a professor of robotics at the University of California, Berkeley, claims that telepresence’s appeal comes from its sense of empowerment. ""One of the benefits of the robots is that they enhance the sense of agency, of being an agent, in the remote environment,"" he said in an interview with Spectrum. ""You are not just a passive conversationalist; you can actually move around and explore."" If the Double wasn’t practical for actual work, I’d hoped that the sense of physical presence would help me socialize more naturally with my coworkers. I’d imagined myself trundling around our New York offices like a sociable R2-D2: snapping jokes, exchanging gossip, and making those finger gun gestures I’ve seen cool people use in the movies. It wasn’t until I actually logged into the robot and looked around the office that I remembered that of course, no one would ever act like this, even in person. A telepresence robot may give you the ability to move around and explore in a remote environment, but you’re still beholden to all the usual social conventions of the 21st century office. People didn't really talk much anyway. Most work was happening in Slack, and so was most socializing.   This was my second problem with telepresence: it’s just not that great for getting to know people with. Even if it was normal to be wandering around the office bothering people, doing so using an ungainly robot would be beyond the pale. There’s something about the thought of interrupting people via an iPad on a stick that doesn't seem right. ""I couldn’t be bothered to disturb you in person,"" it says, ""so here’s my idiot robot avatar. Yep, that’s right, you have to talk to me normally even though we both know this is a deeply silly situation."" It wasn’t like I could use the bot to grab lunch either — not unless whomever I went with could provide a Wi-Fi hotspot for me and was happy running interference on the sidewalk. Other normal chatting opportunities — like taking a walk down a corridor for example — were made impossible simply by the lack of peripheral vision. Between that and always having to turn to see what’s to the side of you, using the Double felt like playing Doom. But in an office. My triumph, such as it was, came at an impromptu office pizza party. I’d just finished an edit and decided to roll up as everyone grabbed a slice for lunch. I zoomed towards the table as fast as I could and for about five minutes the whole thing was kinda funny. I think. Here I was, a face on an iPad, 3,500 miles away from my colleagues and making jokes about if there was a way for someone to feed me a slice of pepperoni pizza over the internet. People were taking pictures. Someone put a hat on me. Success, right? But, this leads me to problem number three with telepresence, or half-problem number three: the bot you’re inhabiting shapes how people relate to you. It might sound silly, but think about the rolling ball robot that appeared in the new Star Wars trailer: that thing was onscreen for all of two seconds, but it was long enough for us to think, ""Oh my, that’s a cute robot."" The Double is cute, too. It’s dinky and kind of earnest looking, and I can’t imagine a manager being taken seriously if they were using one to keep employees on their toes. However, being cute was also beneficial. Because the bot has the motor skills of a toddler, people were happy to help steer me around difficult terrain and winced when I accidentally rolled into a door. A status-obsessed manager might hate people taking pity on them, but for me it was just convenient that they cared. I can see this look-after-baby effect being annoying if you had to base your entire office presence on using one if these bots, but it was certainly helpful in small doses. Of course, no one’s going to use telepresence in this way, at least not any time soon. If bots of the Double’s calibre do find a place in offices then it’ll probably be as supplementary tools. They won’t be necessary, but they might find a niche — getting rolled out for international meetings, for example, or when sickness or bad weather forces people to stay at home. I can imagine people joking about ""having to take the bot to work,"" but actually enjoying the experience — especially if the concept's familiar and they’ve already made friends around the office. Because for all the ingrained silliness of telepresence, there is something deeply satisfying about pressing a button here and having something move, at your command, over there. Extending human agency is a lot of what technology is about, and as the bots get better and cheaper, it’ll become more tempting to give telepresence a try. As for me, I’m happy enough sticking with email, Slack, and the casual voyeurism of Twitter to get to know my colleagues. As mediums of communication, these might lack the subtler cues of face-to-face chats, but at least I can use gifs and emoji when I need to add a little interpersonal pizzaz. When telepresence bots can do the same, maybe I’ll give them another go.

It's what the researchers call an ""innate avoidance response."" This was determined by stimulating embryos with ""very weak"" electrical fields and studying their reactions. However, the sharks were also able to recognize when they were repeatedly subjected to the same electrical field, and their response lessened with each subsequent exposure.

Here are domestic grosses (adjusted for inflation): Point is, Cameron knows how to make a successful movie, and can pretty much get anything he wants. In the case of Avatar, that involved developing brand new technology to make his vision happen, and then he released a special ""4D"" version of the movie for South Korea. So with all that in mind, this is what Cameron has to say about the upcoming Avatar sequels (via Empire): ""They're gonna be bitchin'. You will shit yourself with your mouth wide open."" In August 2013, it was revealed that Cameron was planning to make three Avatar sequels, all filmed simultaneously. At the time Cameron said, ""In writing the new films, I've come to realize that Avatar's world, story and characters have become even richer than I anticipated."" Details are pretty light; according to Empire, Cameron and his team are still currently working on the first two scripts. The first Avatar sequel is expected to hit theaters in December 2016, and remember: if James Cameron offers you a 4DX movie experience, you say no.

Thanksgiving and the days following it are supposed to be among the busiest each year for theaters, with plenty of families heading out to spend some time together. The good news this year is that there are some pretty great movies to see right now. Here are our recommendations for what you should check out, most of which should make for a fun couple of hours:   A compelling thriller built around a wonderful performance by Benedict Cumberbatch, The Imitation Game makes for a great mixture of history and excitement as it runs through the life of mathematician Alan Turing during his time as a World War II codebreaker. It's exciting enough that thrill-seekers will enjoy it, interesting enough that history fans will like it, and smart enough that just about everyone should find something in it to like. Read our review of The Imitation Game    Reactions to Interstellar have been mixed, but it's hard not to recommend seeing what Christopher Nolan has done with such a huge sci-fi palette. If you're heading to the theater with fans of space, science fiction, or epic stories, Interstellar should be an easy choice. Just remember: it's almost three hours long, so make sure you clear your schedule. Read our review of Interstellar    Big Hero 6 is a Disney superhero movie about a boy and a goofy, inflatable robot. If you're going to the theater with kids, Big Hero 6 should be the obvious choice. It's The Avengers for beginners — a fun superhero flick that's great for kids and enjoyable enough for adults, too.   Read our review of Big Hero 6      Opinions on Mockingjay Part 1 are heated in the Verge newsroom, with some calling it a smart commentary on what it means to be a figurehead and others viewing it as easily the weakest entry in the series. But let's be real: if you've already seen the first two Hunger Games, you're going to want to see this one. There's still one more to go, coming this time next year.   Read our review of Mockingjay Part 1      So you want real tension? Forget The Imitation Game and head over to Gone Girl. If you haven't caught David Fincher's latest thriller yet, it's about time that you do. It's an eerie, dark, and smart film with some great performances. In other words: everything you'd expect from Fincher. Just be aware that, as much as you might enjoy Gone Girl as a film, you're not exactly going to be walking out happy.   Read our review of Gone Girl      If you're the type of person who loves cinema, Birdman is a must-see. It's a stunning portrait of a washed-up actor and the people around him, but it's also just a feat of incredible filmmaking — the entire movie is made to look like it takes place in one long shot. It's not a movie for everyone, but if you're intrigued, definitely check it out.   Read our review of Birdman       Even if none of this weekend's movies interest you, there's still one good reason to go to the theater: to get the first look at Star Wars: The Force Awakens. The trailer is 88 seconds long, and it'll be playing at 30 movie theaters across North America.

Should it make it through to production and should Del Toro sign on to direct, the movie might not see release until 2018, on account of the packed schedule of the Pacific Rim director. In addition to a huge slate of standalone superhero outings, DC already has two Justice League movies on the way, featuring Henry Cavill's Superman, Ben Affleck's Batman, and Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman. It's not clear yet whether a Justice League: Dark film would take place in the same continuity.

Facebook is a family now, Mark Zuckerberg said onstage today at Facebook’s F8 Developer conference. And he wasn’t talking about Lean In-style camaraderie among his coworkers: he was talking about apps. While Facebook’s flagship app remains its most used, the company has acquired and built a handful of other major social platforms: Instagram, WhatsApp, and Groups among them. But like most families, Facebook has a golden child — and it’s Facebook Messenger. Since it split Messenger off from the main app last spring, Facebook has gradually laid the foundation for its messaging platform to become the Western world’s answer to Asian giants like LINE and WeChat: mega-messengers that combine communication, gaming, e-commerce, and other categories into a single lucrative channel. It added video and voice calling; it added a way for users to send cash for free; and it hired away PayPal’s well regarded CEO to run the product. Laying the foundation for a platform And now it’s a platform: in the biggest announcement of the day, Facebook introduced 47 apps that now integrate natively with Messenger. For starters, Facebook worked with companies that offer enhanced forms of self-expression: there’s Ultratext, for sending flashing neon text GIFs; Camoji, which creates short GIFs using your phone’s camera; and dozens more apps that tweak messages in various ways.   It all seems rather trifling, until you consider the second half of the announcement: you can now message businesses. Companies can integrate Messenger into their websites, allowing customers to complete transactions through the app. They can send order confirmations, shipping updates, and even provide customer support. Presto: Messenger is now an e-commerce platform. A year ago, the analyst Ben Thompson wrote a post about Facebook and messaging that, in light of today’s news, reads as prophesy. Thompson was trying to make sense of why Rakuten would spend $900 million to acquire a lesser messaging platform named Viber. He sees messaging apps as the successors to direct mail and email: powerful advertising tools that reach customers in a place that feels intimate and personal.   LINE, the dominant platform in Japan and a handful of other Asian countries, helped establish this link by connecting companies with customers through messaging. On LINE you might agree to receive messages from a company in exchange for downloading a pack of stickers. Now that company can tempt you with various offers; LINE has also experimented successfuly with flash sales. (WeChat, the dominant messaging app in China, has employed many of the same tactics, to great effect.) Running the LINE playbook Is Facebook simply running the LINE playbook? After today’s keynote, I sat down with Chris Cox, the company’s chief product officer. Cox has a habit of understatement, and he characterized the Messenger platform as a kind of research experiment. How big can the platform grow? ""We’ll see what people need, and what they want out of it,"" Cox said. ""You learn a lot watching people try to use it."" If it works, though, we should expect Facebook’s other messaging services to develop platform characteristics. Will WhatsApp become a platform, for example? ""I think the WhatsApp team will learn from what’s happening here,"" Cox said. Later, he said, they would decide ""what makes sense for them to integrate. We’re just starting with one ecosystem that will allow us to learn."" Writing about Asian mega-messengers last year, Thompson wrote: ""the sky is the limit. Both have effectively built platforms on top of iOS and Android and smack dab in the middle of the most meaningful, and thus most-used, part of our lives: our communication and interaction with those we know and care about."" Today Facebook has wandered directly into the fray. It may not work as Facebook planned — Messenger’s previous incarnation, as a would-be replacement for email, fizzled — but all the pieces are in place. The golden child is growing up fast.",0.7345393427661051,0.2654606572338949,0.674222575667355,652,5.2622699386503067,403,6.096774193548387,0,4,"Apps, Tech, Report",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

A Facebook post wants a like, a tweet begs for favs, and a snap means little without a response. But for sheer drop-everything, look-at-me arrogance, nothing beats the push notification that says ""LIVE NOW."" I’m doing literally anything, the notification says. Watch now, or you’ll miss out forever. The surprise emergence of Meerkat as a social phenomenon this year has been accompanied by a frequent complaint: the links are usually dead by the time you click them. All that thirst, and it’s totally unslaked. But even as the app began to be discovered by celebrities and other high-profile users, Twitter employees began shouting that a better solution was on the horizon: Periscope, an app the company acquired in January for a reported $100 million. Periscope, they said, was more than a way to stream yourself live: it’s also a way to play those streams back. Replays are Periscope's killer feature And now we can see for ourselves. Periscope arrives today on iPhone, with streams also viewable on the web. (An Android version is forthcoming.) Like Meerkat, it allows you to broadcast whatever you’re doing — whether it’s breaking news or making breakfast — live, through video, with a couple of taps. Unlike Meerkat, Periscope can save streams so that you can replay them later. It turns out to be Periscope’s killer feature — and the main reason that it’s likely to become my live-streaming platform of choice.   For everything it got right, Meerkat still looks like an app built in eight weeks — which it was. Periscope has been in development for more than a year, and the app arrives showing nice attention to detail. You sign in with Twitter, and the first thing you see is a list of streams that are currently live. Below it, you’ll see a list of recent streams. Not all can be played back — when you record yourself, you can stop your stream from being replayed with a single tap. But they save by default, and the result is an app that can actually be browsed. Periscope is warm and fuzzy Where Meerkat in its current incarnation is a bare-bones utility, Periscope is more warm and fuzzy. It introduces the world to the concept of infinite hearts — while you watch a stream, you tap to send the person recording it a heart. As soon as you tap, the heart appears on the screen for you and the rest of the audience to see. And you can tap as many times as you like — you can even double-tap to send two hearts simultaneously. It seems silly, but the multi-heart approach serves a purpose: they let the person recording know that their audience still appreciates what they’re doing, even several minutes into a stream. The result is that on popular streams — like that of retired astronaut Chris Hadfield, an early user — hearts fizz furiously in the corner of the screen throughout every broadcast, rising up like soda bubbles. ""It’s like the crowd going wild — who doesn’t like that?"" says Kayvon Beykpour, Periscope’s co-founder. It’s all part of an approach to make broadcasting less intimidating to the average person. ""We don’t want this to be a tool for very few people,"" he says. Like a lot of people lately, Beykpour says broadcasting is finally a tool ready to be embraced by the masses. You won’t be able to launch Periscope directly from the Twitter app, at least not for a while. ""We don’t think we need to start there,"" Beykpour says. ""We think this deserves to be a separate experience indefinitely."" Still, there’s a reason Twitter scooped up Periscope: Twitter is a mostly live experience, and so is its new broadcasting app. ""We always thought that what we were building, if successful, could be a real-time visual pulse of what’s happening around the world,"" Beykpour says. The vision for Twitter is much the same. The push notifications are out of control The big problem with Periscope and its peer apps, as I see it, is that crazy thirst for engagement. Imagine getting a push notification each time every single person you follow on Twitter tweeted. That’s Periscope in a nutshell — but instead of easily digestible tweets the notifications lead to livestreams, some of which are many minutes long. The result, at least for me, was turning off push notifications for Periscope as soon as I could. And I was following fewer than 50 people! I’ll still use the app, but on my terms — and the team really ought to develop some more granular controls around notifications. Of course, that I can browse it on my terms is only thanks to the fact that Periscope thought to make its streams available for replays. I’m not quite prepared to say the app is a Meerkat killer — Meerkat has been growing its user base at 30 percent a day, and it just announced a big new round of investment this morning. But for now at least, Periscope better matches the way that most of us actually use the internet. As of today, Meerkat has a lot of catching up to do.

The feasibility of such a mission was exhaustively detailed in a study prepared for the Keck Institute for Space Studies by a group of NASA and university scientists that was published this past April. The study found that it would be feasible to send a automated craft to space on an Atlas V rocket to capture and return a 7 meter-wide (roughly 23 feet) near Earth asteroid at an estimated cost of $2.6 billion — just a bit more than the cost of Curiosity's mission to Mars.

It also relied on the assumption that humans will be in space in the mid-2020s and would therefore be able to land on and study the asteroid. The study suggests that bringing an asteroid near Earth would provide an affordable destination for astronauts to land on in preparation for future Mars missions, pave the way for future missions using robots to bring resources to space crews, and help develop future mining operations. It's also suggested that it would provide information to help us prepare to deflect asteroids bound to collide with Earth in the future.

Developed by researchers at the Health and Safety Lab in Derbyshire, England, Larry was designed to help study the spread of the norovirus — an incredibly virulent gastrointestinal disease that experts describe as ""the Ferrari of the virus world."" Researchers have spent more than 40 years looking for a cure for the norovirus, which can inflict often violent vomiting and diarrhea upon the 21 million Americans infected each year, but have thus far been unable to solve its riddle. That's where Larry comes in. Because the virus can be transmitted through tiny vomit particles, scientists are hoping to learn more about how it spreads with an anatomically correct ""humanoid simulated vomiting system."" Each time Larry vomits, researchers can get a better idea of how far the aerosolized norovirus particles travel. A humanoid simulated vomiting system Normally, these particles would be invisible to the human eye, but Larry's ""vomitus substitute"" includes fluorescent markers that help virologists pinpoint its reach; thus far, they've found that the disease can travel more than three meters with a single retch. They can also study how these particles interact with different surfaces, and whether different environments can effect the norovirus' spread. The hope, then, is that Larry will help doctors better contain the transmission of the disease, even if a vaccine remains elusive. Part of the problem is that researchers still don't have a way to actually grow the norovirus in laboratory settings, making it difficult to get a full understanding of how it operates. The virus has also been known to mutate dramatically, which further complicates attempts to harness it. ""There are many strains, and the virus changes very rapidly - it undergoes something virologists call genetic drift,"" said John Harris, a virus expert at Britain's Health Protection Agency. ""When it makes copies of itself, it makes mistakes in those copies - so each time you encounter the virus you may be encountering a slightly different one.""

It's a story without a byline, or rather, without a human byline — a financial story written and published by an automated system well-versed in the AP Style Guide. The AP implemented the system six months ago and now publishes 3,000 such stories every quarter — and that number is poised to grow. Quarterly earnings are a necessity for business reporting — and it can be both monotonous and stressful, demanding a combination of accuracy and speed. That's one of the reasons why last summer the AP partnered with Automated Insights to begin automating quarterly earnings reports using their Wordsmith platform. You wouldn't necessarily know it at first blush. Sure, maybe reading it in the context of this story it's apparent, but otherwise it feels like a pretty standard, if a tad dry, AP news item. The obvious tell doesn't come until the end of an article: ""This story was generated by Automated Insights."" According to AI's public relations manager James Kotecki, the Wordsmith platform generates millions of articles per week; other partners include Allstate, Comcast, and Yahoo, whose fantasy football reports are automated. Kotecki estimates the company's system can produce 2,000 articles per second if need be. ""I wouldn't expect a good journalist to not be skeptical."" Philana Patterson, an assistant business editor at the AP tasked with implementing the system, tells us there was some skepticism from the staff at first. ""I wouldn't expect a good journalist to not be skeptical,"" she said. Patterson tells us that when the program first began in July, every automated story had a human touch, with errors logged and sent to Automated Insights to make the necessary tweaks. Full automation began in October, when stories ""went out to the wire without human intervention."" Both the AP and Automated Insights tell us that no jobs have been lost due to the new service. We're also told the automated system is now logging in fewer errors than the human-produced equivalents from years past. Ten times as many reports every quarter — and no jobs cut Before this program was implemented, the AP estimates it was doing quarterly earnings coverage for about 300 companies. Now it automates 3,000 such reports each quarter. Of those, 120 will have an added human touch, either by updating the original story or doing a separate follow-up piece. One such company is Apple; as Patterson notes, that automated Apple story freed up reporter Brandon Bailey to focus on this angled, more nuanced report contextualizing the company's earnings along with quotes from Apple executives. Others include Google, Coca-Cola, and American Airlines. 180 more are monitored to see if a follow-up is needed. Then there are ten companies that aren't automated at all due to the nuance of their reports — companies like Citigroup and Wells Fargo. Patterson says all these lists are re-evaluated and updated every quarter. Since the partnership began, elements like business descriptions and forward-looking guidance has been added to the platform's skill list. The next step is expansion — more than 1,000 Canadian companies plus a few elsewhere around the world. Patterson also told us the AP is starting to look at other uses outside of earnings reports. Robots should only be referred to by gender-neutral pronouns, no matter how sexy they may be.  So no, computers are not taking journalists' jobs — not yet, at any rate. Instead, they're freeing up writers to think more critically about the bigger picture. ""One of the things we really wanted reporters to be able to do was when earnings came out to not have to focus on the initial numbers,"" said Patterson. ""That's the goal, to write smarter pieces and more interesting stories.""

Similar results, different interpretations Reuters reports that both the French and Swiss researchers found the same levels of polonium-210 — the radioactive isotope alleged to have poisoned Arafat — in his system, but that they differ in explaining how it got there. While the Swiss researchers believe that it may have been the result of poisoning, the French researchers reportedly found that some of it could be explained by the presence of radon gas in the tomb that Arafat was buried in. Reuters says that the French report is not set to be published. The investigation into Arafat's death began in 2011, when the Swiss group sampled clothing worn by Arafat around the time of his death. The Swiss researchers' results were published in a 2012 Al Jazeera documentary, which prompted the later exhumation.

Since Jeff Bezos announced Amazon's hypothetical delivery-by-octocopter service earlier this week, its drones have become a point of focus for existing debates over privacy, regulation, and ""disruptive"" technology. The plan has given a sense of urgency to questions about widespread governmental and commercial drone use, and a new hook for members of Congress trying to answer those questions through legislation. Yesterday, Rep. Ted Poe (R-TX) became the second member of Congress to raise the specter of Amazon Prime Air to support an anti-surveillance bill, giving a sometimes colorful account of how the drones could change our future. In just a few years, Bezos said people will be able to order something online and have it in their hands within 30 minutes by the use of drones. It sounds like something out of the Jetsons, doesn't it? Gone will be the days of the neighborhood mail carriers. Soon there will be a drone to replace them. According to Amazon, these drones can deliver packages up to 5 pounds, which makes up 90 percent of their deliveries. Mr. Speaker, thousands of Americans use Amazon every year, especially around the holiday season. Amazon, unlike the glitch-ridden government Web sites, can efficiently use online Internet services that get a timely product to market. Think of how many drones could soon be flying around the sky. Here a drone, there a drone, everywhere a drone in the United States. Poe congratulated Amazon on its plan but said it also opened the door to privacy violations, including a drone-based product recommendation service that watches your house to figure out what consumer goods you're missing. The issue of concern, Mr. Speaker, is surveillance, not the delivery of packages. That includes surveillance of someone's backyard, snooping around with a drone, checking out a person's patio to see if that individual needs new patio furniture from the company. His actual, fairly practical bill, co-sponsored by Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-CA), was brought in February. It would require law enforcement to obtain a warrant before using surveillance drones, make it illegal to violate someone's reasonable expectation of privacy with a privately owned craft, and ban weaponized drones on American soil — an issue that was at the forefront of the public consciousness in early 2013 as leaked documents provided details on the CIA's drone operations abroad. Earlier, Senator Ed Markey (D-MA) pushed his own ""Drone Aircraft Privacy and Transparency Act"" in the wake of Bezos' announcement. ""Before drones start delivering packages, we need the FAA to deliver privacy protections for the American public,"" he wrote in a statement. While both Markey and Poe described the Amazon octocopters as taking flight in the next few years, the actual timeline for anything beyond testing is a lot longer, and the doorstop drone service Amazon describes seems unlikely to happen at all barring a major policy shift and solutions to some basic technological problems.",0.6184995864754077,0.3815004135245923,0.8907950873612019,491,5.258655804480652,319,6.2695924764890281,0,0,"US & World, Politics",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

As AFP reports, the truck was carrying the material from a hospital in Tijuana to a waste center before it was stolen near Mexico City. Suspects have yet to be named, though Mexican authorities have alerted the public and are currently investigating. The cobalt-60 material onboard was used for medical purposes, and was properly sealed at the time of the robbery, the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said in a statement Wednesday. It could be ""extremely dangerous,"" however, if the thieves remove or damage the shielding. Cobalt-60 is a synthetic radioactive isotope used in a variety of industrial applications and for medical radiotherapy. It is usually held in medical containers that prevent people from being exposed for strong radiation. Search is ongoing In the US, officials have sought to better secure nuclear materials held at hospitals and other sites, amid fears that terrorists could easily obtain them to create bombs. A 2012 congressional audit found serious gaps in security at several US hospitals, raising concerns among experts. The IAEA says the materials stolen in Mexico could not be used to create a conventional nuclear weapon, though they could theoretically be used to create a dirty bomb, which would disperse radioactive material across wide areas. The IAEA has confirmed more than 2,000 cases of illicit trafficking of nuclear material between 1993 and 2012, including the 2011 arrest of six people in Moldovia accused of trying to sell uranium on the black market.

(Flickr / Asian Media) Grand Ayatollah Ali Khamenei is the Supreme Leader of Iran. He's devout, conservative, and fiercely anti-Western. He's also an avid Twitter user. Over the past few months, both Khamenei and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani have warmed up to social media, regularly using Facebook and Twitter to release statements, push agendas, and, in some cases, engage in diplomatic tussles. It’s not that different from how politicians across the globe use social platforms, but the Iranian case is unique considering the leadership’s long-standing public aversion to all things Western — and to social media, in particular. Sites like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube are blocked within Iran, underscoring a fundamental tension that has only recently begun to crystallize: as Iranian officials continue to spread their messages across social platforms, the country’s citizens remain quarantined behind web filters and firewalls, unable to legally access the services that have suddenly become an important part of their political landscape. ""Certainly there is a glaring hypocrisy."" ""Certainly there is a glaring hypocrisy in how openly and frequently Iran's officials engage in social media,"" Afshon Ostovar, a Middle East analyst at CNA Strategic Studies, wrote in an email to The Verge. This hypocrisy likely isn’t lost on everyday Iranian internet users, Ostovar adds, though hard-line conservatives and government officials have begun speaking out against it, as well. On Monday, Iran’s police chief publicly criticized the country’s leaders for using social media, telling Iran's Mehr news agency that their actions could encourage others to break the law. ""The fact that some officials have started to cross red lines gradually and enter spaces prohibited for citizens is not a good thing, and everyone should observe the rules,"" said Ahmadi Moghaddam, the police chief. ""By violating the law [themselves], the officials should bear in mind that their actions should not pave the way for others to violate the law."" Iran blocked Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube in 2009, after demonstrators used the services to help organize massive protests against the disputed re-election of conservative president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. About 26 percent of Iranians use the internet, and only those savvy enough to use proxy servers or virtual private networks (VPNs) can access blacklisted sites that the government considers immoral or threatening to the Islamic regime. ""officials should bear in mind that their actions should not pave the way for others to violate the law."" The government tightened its control over the internet under Ahmadinejad, calling for the creation of a state-run internet and government-controlled email service. But the election of Rouhani, a political moderate, has raised hopes that the country may relax its grip, and there are signs that change may be on the horizon. In an October Twitter conversation with Jack Dorsey, Twitter's co-founder, Rouhani said he wants to ensure that Iranians have open access to global information, echoing statements he made in an earlier interview with CNN. Culture minister Ali Jannati was even more pointed last month, telling state media that Iranians should have free access to ""not only Facebook, but other social networks.""  The election of President Hassan Rouhani has raised hopes that Iran may loosen its web restrictions. (Flickr / Asia Society) Rouhani joined Twitter in April and launched a separate English-language account one month later. It's not clear whether he authors every tweet himself, and Twitter has yet to verify him or Khamenei, but the accounts are believed to be authentic and Twitter has verified other members of Rouhani's cabinet. But the administration's calls for an open internet have been countered by Iran's more conservative factions, including the ayatollah. In a speech delivered last month, Khamenei said that during the 2009 protests, the US had ""hoped to overthrow the Islamic Republic with the help of media activities and networks such as Facebook, Twitter, and other such networks. They had these foolish delusions."" Others have expressed similar concerns over American web services. Moghaddam told Iranian media last year that Google is nothing more than a ""spying tool"" for the US, reiterating security fears that have been percolating since 2010, when the devastating Stuxnet virus struck the country's nuclear and industrial facilities. Subsequent reports suggested that the attack was ordered by the US. Experts say that much of this anti-Western rhetoric is politically motivated, especially for the ayatollah, who, as Iran's theocratic leader, represents the interests of religious conservatives. Even on Twitter, he continues to post brazen and often incendiary comments about Israel and the US, putting him in stark contrast to the moderate Rouhani, who has adopted a more conciliatory tone on social media.   Israeli regime, this sinister, unclean rabid dog of the region.. https://t.co/yPIv5s0b3L #Iran pic.twitter.com/LD5yaNUYXd    ""Engaging with the US, not to mention compromising on the nuclear issue, goes against what the leader and his hardliner constituency have promoted for the last decade,"" Ostovar says. ""In a sense, Khamenei has to play the bad cop to Rouhani’s good cop."" Yet despite his public misgivings, the ayatollah and other Iranian leaders have realized that social media can allow them to both control their messaging and engage with the West — a major objective of the Rouhani administration. Economic sanctions levied over Iran’s nuclear program have crippled the country’s economy, spurring Rouhani to pursue the international nuclear agreement that began to take form at last month’s negotiations in Geneva. ""Khamenei has to play the bad cop to Rouhani’s good cop."" Iranian officials launched a renewed social media offensive while in Geneva, using Twitter to directly contest statements from the US and to seize control over the media narrative. Prior to the most recent round of negotiations, the government apparently launched an English-language website, NuclearEnergy.ir, as part of an attempt to defuse suspicions that its nuclear program could be used to create weapons. Such actions are clearly targeted toward international audiences, though it’s not as if Iranian citizens are completely in the dark. People without VPNs or other workaround solutions are still aware of what their leaders tweet, because reformist newspapers, magazines, and TV networks often analyze what Iran’s leaders say on social media, typically publishing screenshots of their tweets and Facebook posts. ""Even for Iranians who don’t use social media, it’s covered by [traditional] media,"" says Narges Bajoghli, a PhD candidate in anthropology at New York University who has written extensively on Iran. ""So they're engaged with what Rouhani and others are saying, even if it's through secondary sources."" ""they're engaged, even if it's through secondary sources."" Iranians are therefore well aware of what their leaders are tweeting, though there doesn’t seem to be much of a groundswell for internet reform. Bajoghli says that could be because Iranians realize that the web can be a double-edged sword. ""I think some people have become rightly paranoid about the internet being an easier way to track activities,"" Bajoghli says. ""They understand that what they do online can be tracked by the government, or at least that's the fear that they have."" And although Rouhani seems intent on loosening restrictions and filters, there’s little he alone can do to bring about change. Ultimate power over Iran’s internet rests in the hands of its Supreme Council of Cyberspace, which Khamenei established last year to provide ""constant and comprehensive monitoring over the domestic and international cyberspace."" As president, Rouhani is the chair of the committee, though it also includes members of the Revolutionary Guard and other conservative factions. Finding consensus among reformists, conservatives, and, of course, the ayatollah will be difficult, experts say, and it likely won't happen overnight. ""Iran's regime has always been relatively open-minded when it has come to adopting new technologies,"" Ostovar says. ""It has been equally closed-minded when it has come to allowing avenues for free speech.""",0.6173937549180663,0.38260624508193375,0.8657303117539793,1310,5.5259541984732827,668,6.8667664670658679,0,0,"Policy & Law, US & World, Web, Report",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

So I watched today's newly-released Jurassic World trailer with great anticipation, and was left with only one question: why the hell did they invent a dinosaur? The plot of World turns on a new strain of ""hybrid"" dinosaur, which causes a befuddled Chris Pratt to run around with Very Serious Expressions — all of which might make for a highly entertaining movie, but not a Jurassic Park movie. The whole point of Jurassic Park is to bring real dinosaurs into the present day — that's why the T. rex and raptors in the first movie were so much fun, and why the awful second movie was redeemed by the T. rex smashing up San Diego. The third movie was terrible, but the Spinosaurus and Pterenodon were terrifying —because they once actually lived on earth. Take away the real dinosaurs, and you're just left with a made-up monster movie. So why did Steven Spielberg and director Colin Trevorrow feel compelled to invent a new dino for this hopefully-triumphant return to the screen?   @reckless ""we need clear IP on the dinosaur, the toy companies say they can’t have any copycats this time""  Oh.",0.15934174084389408,0.8406582591561059,0.18468139993349833,256,4.58203125,156,5.4038461538461542,0,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

In an email responding to inquiries from The Verge, a person identifying as one of the hackers writes, ""We Want equality [sic]. Sony doesn't. It's an upward battle."" The hackers' goals remain unclear, but they used the attack yesterday to specifically call out Sony Entertainment CEO Michael Lynton, referring to him as a ""criminal"" in a tweet.  ""We worked with other staff with similar interests to get in."" The hackers claim to have taken sensitive internal data from Sony. In an email from an address associated with the hack, a hacker who identified as ""lena"" was vague about how the attack was carried out. ""Sony doesn't lock their doors, physically, so we worked with other staff with similar interests to get in,"" lena writes. ""Im sorry I can't say more, safety for our team is important [sic]."" The email address in question is an open account, which allows anyone to send mail from it without entering a password. That means it's possible the message was sent by someone with no relation to the attack itself. Still, because the address was included in the initial .zip file and lena identified as part of the group behind the attack, the message raises real questions about the political motives behind Sony's recent troubles. The account has also sent similar messages to other outlets, suggesting a consistent voice. As a result of the hack, Sony Pictures employees walked into work yesterday to find the image of a glowing red skeleton on their computer. The image was covered with the phrase ""Hacked by #GOP,"" beneath which was a list of instructions and demands. The note said that Sony was already aware of the group's demands and that the group would release Sony's ""secrets and top secrets"" if they did not comply by last night. That does not appear to have happened. Deadline reports that Sony's computer systems remain down today across the globe. It appears that the hackers may have taken a large swath of data off of an internal Sony computer system. The hackers' note to employees includes a link to files that describe what has been taken and can be released. Much of it is not sensitive — like podcasts and promotional stills — but it's possible that sensitive documents are mixed in among the files. Notably, the hackers also identify themselves, at least by pseudonym and email address, among the mix of documents. One file says that the hack was carried out by the ""Guardians of Peace,"" and includes disposable email addresses for seven different names. Sony, so far, has not commented in any manner of detail on the hack. Last night it said that it was ""investigating an IT matter.""

Nielsen has been tracking Swift's YouTube views in recent weeks, and they've been shooting upward all month after her entire discography was pulled from Spotify on November 3rd.

Meanwhile, audio streaming predictably took a nosedive; Swift's back catalog remains available from Beats Music and other music apps that require a paid subscription. But as the chart shows, no one's really listening to her there. Fans are going where the free music is. Even if it means dealing with ads. We can't directly link Swift's abandonment of Spotify with the rise in YouTube clicks. 1989 has been dominating the Billboard charts, so there would've been a spike regardless.

That means project pages will be staying the same — as will pages for finished projects that never managed to get enough funding. The Spotlight layout will be available today to all funded projects.

A year later, the company unveiled the Surface Pro 3, but made no mention of a regular ""Surface 3"" at a lower price point; Microsoft also abruptly scraped plans for a Surface Mini that was presumably intended to compete against Apple's iPad mini. WinBeta claims the new Surface will be unveiled before or at Microsoft's Build conference next month, and should hit retail in close proximity to that announcement. It will reportedly ship with a full version of Windows — likely to be 8.1 — and be upgradeable to Windows 10 when that ships sometime this summer. As far as design goes, WinBeta says the Surface 3 will be fanless and run in silence thanks to the inclusion of either an Intel Atom or Core M processor. Accordingly, Microsoft is unlikely to promote the new device as a professional-caliber machine; the Surface Pro 3 will still hold that distinction for now. Microsoft has already washed its hands of the unsuccessful Windows RT operating system, so it's no surprise to hear that all of its tablet plans now revolve around full-blown Windows. Still, the regular Surface's future was very much uncertain when it was a no show at the Surface Pro 3's 2014 debut.

A study published yesterday suggests that extended exposure to a particular kind of radiation found in space can accelerate the development of Alzheimer's disease. The study focused on galactic cosmic radiation consisting of iron particles, which are said to permeate space at high speeds due to the force of exploding stars. We're safe from these particles here on earth, but out in deep space only the spacecraft will stand between astronauts and the radiation. Study author Kerry O'Banion says that the iron particles have no trouble punching through a ship's hull, adding that it would require a ""six-foot block of lead or concrete"" to stop them. In the study, which was carried out over eight years with funding from NASA, mice were exposed to varying degrees of radiation before being analyzed for cognitive loss. In one test to check for memory degradation, researchers studied whether mice would remember (read: avoid) an environment that had previously shocked their feet. Mice that were exposed to radiation performed more poorly in these experiments than those that did not, and they exhibited other signs of Alzheimer's, like inflamed blood vessels and atypically high levels of beta amyloid, a protein known to be associated with the disease. O'Banion did note that the mice received the radiation in about a three minute period, while astronauts will be exposed to the same amount of radiation over a period of years. He added that it's possible that ""the body might adapt to small chronic dosing,"" but for now, those signing up for manned missions to deep space locations like asteroids or Mars might want to take note.",0.42424449179487433,0.5757555082051257,0.8180653392754711,287,5.0383275261324041,189,5.7089947089947088,0,0,Science,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I mean it’s not just beauty at this dimension, at one centimeter; there’s also beauty at smaller dimensions, the inner structure, also the processes. The fact that the colors in the flower evolved in order to attract insects to pollinate it is interesting; it means that insects can see the color.

It's starting to make that happen today with the release of Video to GIF, a simple tool that lets you quickly select a clip from a streaming video — like those on YouTube — and then turn it into a GIF. Except, there's one big catch: most of the time, Video to GIF won't actually present you with a .gif file. It'll give you what Imgur calls a "".gifv,"" which works much the same way as a true GIF but has some key differences in how it can be played back.  The tool has its problems, but the GIFs look great Imgur's GIFV (which is really just an approachable name for existing video formats) is great for holding high-quality clips in small sizes that load fast, but they aren't as easy to share as a normal GIF. You need the right embed code to put one on a website, and you're probably not going to be sending these over email unless you feel like digging into the HTML. None of that is terribly difficult — and you'll get a far nicer result for dealing with it — but at this point, it still isn't made quite as simple. That may be fine for Imgur. Imgur isn't just an image host — it's a network that you're meant to browse around, too. And naturally, GIFV clips look and work perfectly on Imgur itself. That may make Video to GIF more about making the Imgur experience better than it is about making the general GIF experience better. But even so, these clips can still be played back on other websites. The only real problem is that the embed code Imgur provides isn't perfect, so you'll have to do a bit of tinkering to properly share one. Video to GIF has a few other issues, too. That includes not making it clear whether you're going to get a GIF or a GIFV after conversion (almost always the latter), occasionally cutting the clip too long or starting it too early, offering a text overlay tool that just totally does not work (in our tests), and frequently failing during its conversion process. Video to GIF will let you download a GIF version of your GIFVs most of the time, but because they're optimized to look so good, they'll be at a large size that's far from shareable. Imgur clearly still has some work to do with Video to GIF, but even after all of those complaints, it's hard to say that it isn't on to something. The tool is really easy to use, and seriously, just look at how nice this GIF is:  Update January 29th, 12:35PM ET: This story has been updated to note that Imgur frequently allows users to download .gif versions of clips that are presented as a GIFV.

Two years later, the game is expanding to even more devices, and soon you'll be able to play it on your big screen as Badland makes its way to just about every console out there. ""We always wanted to bring Badland on to the consoles, but that required more resources,"" says Frogmind COO Teemu Mäki-Patola. ""Thanks to its success on tablets we can finally make that dream a reality."" No specific release date has been announced — you can expect to see the game on consoles this spring — but it's coming to a huge range of platforms. That includes the PS3, PS4, Vita, Xbox One, and Wii U, along with Windows, Mac, and Linux via Steam. At first glance, it might not seem like the most natural fit: one of Badland's defining characteristics is that it's designed to work perfectly with a touchscreen. ""It wasn't the easiest thing, but it needed to be done."" In the game, you guide a strange, flapping creature through a dark alien world using just one finger, tapping the screen to keep it in the air and out of danger. Badland is one of those games that just feels right on your smartphone. According to Mäki-Patola, the new big-screen version — officially dubbed Badland: Game of the Year Edition — has expanded controls that let you do a lot more than just float; now you can move backwards and even control your speed.  ""This type of control felt best to us, but it broke a lot of puzzles and levels that depended on the player being able to do less,"" he says. ""The solution was to modify every level in the game to accommodate the more expressive control scheme and that's what we ended up doing. It wasn't the easiest thing, but it needed to be done and it was worth it."" The console version also features local multiplayer and co-operative modes, for a total of nearly 15 hours worth of gameplay across 100 different single-player levels, 100 co-op missions, and more. While we've seen plenty of console games eventually get ported to mobile, it's less common for games to move in the other direction — and aside from a few big names like Threes, mobile-to-console ports haven't seen much success. Mäki-Patola is hoping that the deeper controls and additional content will make the game feel like something meant for your television, and not just another forgettable mobile port. ""It is a surprisingly big game,"" he says. ""If you saw the console version first, you would not suspect that it wasn't initially made for [mobile].""",0.6411598740440879,0.3588401259559121,0.20460472725495885,474,4.6118143459915615,273,5.6483516483516487,0,0,"Culture, Gaming",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Officials say the site can now support its original goal of 50,000 users, even though it failed to support even 200 to 300 concurrent users in tests a few days before launch. ""While we still have work to do, we have made significant progress with Healthcare.gov working for the vast majority of users,"" Jeff Zients, who is leading the effort to repair Healthcare.gov, told reporters on a press call today. The improvement is the result of more than 400 software fixes and hardware upgrades, including a significant hardware upgrade on Friday night that roughly doubled the site's capacity. ""We still have work to do."" The error rate, which the government defines as system timeouts or failures, is now around 0.75 percent, down from more than 6 percent. Response times have been under a second for the last three weeks, down from eight seconds. It's all good news for users who have been trying to buy insurance through the site but were stopped by bugs and long wait times. But new data released by the White House also shows just how underprepared Healthcare.gov was when it launched. For example, while uptime is now around 95 percent, it was only 42.9 percent at the beginning of November. Documents released by the White House also show that hardware capacity was initially about a quarter of what was needed for the registration database, around a third of what was needed to support the core database, about half of what was needed to support the website, and only one fifth of what was eventually needed to support the firewall. After an assessment in mid-October, the administration set a goal of fixing the website for the ""vast majority"" of users by November 30th. That metric was later refined to 80 percent of users. With today's announcement, the White House can say it has met that goal — although critics will point out that that means 20 percent of users are still having trouble. The White House says it has met its November 30th deadline ""The status of HealthCare.gov in October was marked by an unacceptable user experience,"" says a report released by the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversaw the effort to build and then bolster the site. ""Dramatic progress has been made on improving Healthcare.gov. While we strive to innovate and improve our outreach and systems for reaching consumers, we believe we have met the goal of having a system that will work smoothly for the vast majority of users."" The team will continue to work to improve the site, Zients says, with contractor QSSI leading the effort with ""private sector speed and focus."" The team also implemented a queuing system in case the system gets overwhelmed with demand as the Affordable Care Act (ACA) deadline for purchasing health insurance approaches. If the site is at capacity, users will be asked for their email address. The system will email them a time to return to the site and a link to jump to the front of the queue.

UN special rapporteur Ben Emmerson said that he would be initiating an investigation into both the NSA and GCHQ in an op-ed published in the Guardian today. Emmerson writes that he's identified five areas of contention worth considering: whether Snowden should be given the legal protections of a whistleblower, whether his leaks damaged US or UK national security, whether his leaks show the need for surveillance overhaul, whether British parliament was misled about the intrusiveness of surveillance, and whether British parliament's current intelligence oversight system is thorough enough.  ""These questions are too important for the UN to ignore."" Following the investigation, Emmerson will deliver a series of recommendations to the UN general assembly next fall. ""These questions are too important for the UN to ignore,"" Emmerson writes. He notes that there are several other issues at hand beyond the five specifically identified, including how a government contractor — not even a direct US government employee — was able to acquire such sensitive information. Emmerson has been critical of other United States' policies lately, having issued a UN report stating that the US should detail civilian casualties by drones. In his op-ed, Emmerson was also highly critical of security officials who have attacked the Guardian for publishing the leaked surveillance documents. ""The astonishing suggestion that this sort of journalism can be equated with aiding and abetting terrorism needs to be scotched decisively,"" Emmerson writes. He says that attacking the Guardian only serves to avoid the real issues. ""The Guardian has revealed that there is an extensive program of mass surveillance that potentially affects every one of us ... The Guardian's revelations are precisely the sort of information that a free press is supposed to reveal."" With the vast majority of Emmerson's op-ed focusing on those attacking the Guardian, it's not made entirely clear how he intends to approach the investigation or if it will be as wide in scope as he implies. Emmerson does say that he will be looking for a much more detailed set of answers than the UK intelligence committee was given when questioning security officials last month.

Performance in these categories remained close to the OECD average, with the report noting ""no significant change"" in any category since 2000, when the first PISA was administered. The OECD administers the PISA every three years. The latest release covers more than 500,000 students from 65 countries, which represent 80 percent of the world's economy.  Other studies have shown similar declines in American educational performance, particularly in math and science. A 2012 study released by the Lynch School of Education and Boston College found that US fourth and eighth graders continue to lag behind in math and science, as their performance has largely stagnated while other countries have accelerated. As the OECD notes, the US spends more than most countries on education — more than $115,000 per student — but its performance remains on par with countries that spend far less. The Slovak Republic, for example, spends about $53,000 per student, but performs at the same level as the US. China (Shanghai) and Singapore were among the top performers in math and science, joining Hong Kong, Japan, and Finland. East Asian countries performed strongest overall, holding seven of the top ten positions across all three categories. PISA is unique in that it assesses a student's ability to apply knowledge to real-world problems, rather than the breadth of their knowledge itself. When it comes to math, American students showed particular difficulty with geometric reasoning and applying classroom principles to real-world situations. a ""picture of educational stagnation."" ""Students in the United States have particular weaknesses in performing mathematics tasks with higher cognitive demands, such as taking real-world situations, translating them into mathematical terms, and interpreting mathematical aspects in real-world problems,"" the OECD writes in the US country note. The Obama administration has sought to boost US classroom performance through a Race to the Top initiative that encourages states to compete for federal funds and includes stronger teacher accountability systems, yet White House officials say today's findings underscore the need to do more. Speaking to the Wall Street Journal, US Education Secretary Arne Duncan described the OECD's PISA results as a ""picture of educational stagnation,"" and that they are at ""odds with our aspiration to have the best-educated, most competitive workforce in the world.""",0.7841946098799233,0.2158053901200767,0.8796377554276319,468,5.5299145299145298,283,6.5512367491166081,0,0,US & World,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

On Sunday, December 1st at 17:30 GMT, the superpower will send the rover to the moon on board its Chang'e-3 lunar probe. In Chinese folklore, Chang'e was a goddess who accidentally swallowed an immortality pill and flew to the Moon, with only a rabbit to keep her company. ""Yutu is a symbol of kindness, purity and agility, and is identical to the moon rover in both outlook and connotation. Yutu also reflects China's peaceful use of space,"" said Li Benzheng, deputy commander-in-chief of China's lunar program, at a press conference announcing the naming choice. ""Yutu also reflects China's peaceful use of space."" Chang'e-1 and Chang'e-2 were merely lunar orbiters, and the primary goal of Chang'e-3 is to achieve a soft landing on the moon. Should all go well, Chang'e and Yutu should arrive on the Moon around December 14th, landing in a plain known as the Sea of Rainbows. After that, the six-wheeled rover will spend three months exploring for resources. China's space program is advancing rapidly, with the country intending to put men on the moon and build a space station of its own before long. However, Chinese officials say they don't intend to provoke another space race, according to a translation at The Planetary Society. In fact, we have no desire to race with any country. China has its own space program. We are realizing our own plans step by step. Our goal is to use space peacefully. It is also the consensus of the world. Human beings need to make use of space resources to support sustainable development. Amusingly, the crew of Apollo 11 were asked to look for Chang'e and her rabbit companion as they were about to land on the moon way back in 1969.

Lucasfilm announced that the trailer will play before movies at 30 theaters starting this Friday and continuing through the weekend:   The trailer runs for 88 seconds and will begin playing worldwide on Monday. Regal Cinemas says that the trailer will be playing before all of the movies it's showing, and it's likely that that will be the case at other theaters as well. The theatrical premiere is an interesting choice for Disney and Lucasfilm, but it'll get Star Wars straight onto the big screen and during one of the biggest moviegoing days of the year. Regal Cinemas says these showings will constitute the trailer's ""world premiere,"" so it really does seem as though you'll need to head out to a movie theater if you want to catch it first. One would imagine that the trailer will be published online eventually, but Disney seems to be interested in kicking things off with a more cinematic experience. (Plus, there's likely a profit motive involved for both it and supporting theaters during this initial weekend.) THANKSGIVING pic.twitter.com/46811BgWiF  Early reports suggest the trailer is short and simple Reports have been coming out for about a week now describing what this first trailer may be like. Filming on The Force Awakens is complete, but it is likely far from polished enough for this to be a very revealing trailer — and the film is a full year away from coming out. Instead, various outlets have reported that the trailer will likely be composed of quick shots of each of the film's stars as a way to introduce them. While that wouldn't show much, that would still be one of the most detailed looks at Episode VII to date. Disney has been extremely secretive throughout the production of The Force Awakens, though it hasn't been entirely unresponsive to fans. As leaks started coming out during filming over the summer, director J.J. Abrams began releasing small teases of the film. He tweeted out a photo that appeared to be taken inside the Millennium Falcon, and in charity videos he showed off a new X-Wing and a new alien, too. Star Wars fans may remember that Lucasfilm pulled a similar stunt to promote the first Star Wars prequel, though distributing a trailer over the internet at that time obviously would have been far less effective. A New York Times report from 1998 says that a trailer running just over two minutes long for The Phantom Menace played on 75 screens in 26 states and had fans showing up to theaters just to watch it and then leave before their movie started. Lucasfilm had teased the trailer's premiere online four days earlier — much like it's doing today. The Force Awakens will be released on December 18th, 2015. Update 4PM ET: this article has been updated to include the full list of theaters that will screen The Force Awakens' trailer.

This week,  large swaths of Star Wars fans will pay upwards of $15 for a ticket to The Penguins of Madagascar and walk out before the movie even starts. The ""world premiere"" first trailer for Episode VII: The Force Awakens will debut this Friday in 30 theaters (28 in the US and two Canada) — potentially more, but the messaging is clear that this is an offline, ticketed event. It's a weird misstep for Disney and Lucasfilm, which so far have been successful in courting the internet at large. This strategy is ostensibly designed with the fans in mind, but by trying to use age-old promotional tactics, it's alienating a rather dedicated following, and more importantly, it's a slap in the face to those who care the most. Point is, all year Disney has courted and benefited from a rabid online Star Wars fan base — and then it artificially limits the first big reveal to an offline audience that largely won't care about being first. In Disney's defense, the studio could not have picked a better weekend to pull this stunt. The day after Thanksgiving is a huge moviegoing day for people — and especially families — in the US. There's the last grasp of summer blockbuster (Interstellar, The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1), ""fun-for-the-whole-family"" fare (The Penguins of Madagascar, Big Hero 6), Oscar hopefuls looking to meet that deadline for eligibility (The Theory of Everything, The Imitation Game, Rosewater), and ""other"" (Dumb and Dumber To). Demographically-speaking, the Star Wars trailer will hit a pretty good sampling of its audience. It's tailored for an audience that doesn't care if they see it first But most of those who'll end up seeing the Star Wars teaser won't care if they see it first. They're not the ones who scour the internet for every morsel of information, generating as much hype as they are consuming it. That community is much larger than this sampling of largely metropolitan-focused cinemas. The strategy is designed to limit exposure and generate hype about the debut itself, rather than the content therein. If you want to see the 88-second trailer, be ready to pay full price for a ticket. Has Disney learned nothing from last month's 'Age of Ultron' leak? None of this takes into account the elephant in the room: that someone will inevitably manage to record the trailer with their smartphone and upload it on YouTube / DailyMotion / Vimeo / Google Drive, and that it'll spread faster than lawyers can catch it. Did Disney learn nothing from The Avengers: Age of Ultron? It was just over a month ago that subsidiary Marvel Studios had to release the trailer early after an internal leak gave us a rough-looking introduction to its big action sequences. (The lawyers, to be sure, haven't forgotten.) Maybe that's part of the plan. Maybe, in addition to the play-by-play recaps fortunate fans will provide in forums, Disney expects rough leaks to surface. But is that how disney wants people to see this for the first time? On a shaky cam while ""Chad' (or whoever) adds color commentary two rows up? Do they think it'll be ""cooler"" for people to feel like they're seeing something they shouldn't? Star Wars fans are a special subset of cultural fanaticisms. There have been documentaries created about them. Disney and Lucasfilm know this, and they encourage it — see, for example, a scene-by-scene remake of Empire Strikes Back created through fan submissions. It's a group that would pay good money just to see seconds of never-before-seen footage before anyone else, even if what they're paying for is an advertisement. Chances are the trailer will be available officially on Monday, streamed for the world to see, but by then, the fans who cared the most will have already seen it — in the worst fidelity imaginable. We've got over a year until Episode VII actually hits theaters, so it's easy to say that this doesn't matter in the grand scheme of things. It doesn't, really — there's little to no chance that this will affect critical reviews or ticket sales. But a trailer release strategy like this is designed to get the franchise's base of evangelists excited. Only it's failed to understand the internet — if anything, it's more likely to have the opposite effect, pissing off the internet-savvy base, except for the relative few in the core audience that'll get to see it the ""right way"" this weekend.

Early reports from Sony employees suggest the studio has yet to regain computer access.  A now-deleted tweet captured by B2C, calling out Sony Entertainment CEO Michael Lynton.

The basic menubar calendar app has been a favorite for many because it makes it so easy to check your upcoming agenda and quickly add new events with normal language. It’s intelligent natural language parsing even made it to the iPhone and iPad too, so you can quickly type “lunch with Paul 12PM tomorrow at Dorsia’s” in Fantastical’s apps and they will know exactly what you mean. But while Fantastical has always been a great little utility app, in order to do more advanced calendaring, you need a full desktop app, such as the OS X’s built-in calendar or Google Calendar in a browser. Today Flexibits, the maker of Fantastical, is directly addressing that with the release of Fantastical 2, a completely new app that combines the best of the original Fantastical menubar app with a full desktop experience.   The biggest difference with Fantastical 2 over its predecessor is well, it's a full app now. It still sits in the menubar for quick access and event creation, but now you can see full days, weeks, months, and years in a separate window. Fantastical 2 supports the calendar accounts already set up on your Mac, but it now has a native CalDAV engine that supports most any calendar service, including iCloud, Google, and Yahoo. The desktop window uses a smart two-panel design to display a running agenda on the left and the full calendar on the right. It also integrates with Apple's iCloud Reminder service, so you can add tasks and see what's coming up in your calendar right from within Fantastical. The natural language parsing feature, which has been updated to support recurring events, can also be used to set alarms and reminders. A big, and perhaps my favorite, new feature in Fantastical 2 is calendar sets, which let you quickly switch between a batch of calendars and reminders lists depending on what you need to do. A work set might have all of the calendars you need to see while working, while a family set will only show personal calendars. Since so many people share calendars with coworkers and family members, it's very convenient to be able to switch between all of the visible calendars with just a couple of clicks. Even better, Fantastical 2 uses location services to show relevant calendar sets depending on where you are. I was able to have the app automatically select my work calendar set when I arrived at the office and opened my laptop, while at home my personal and family calendars come to the front. Flexibits CEO Michael Simmons says the company would like to bring this feature to its iOS apps in the future, and I hope they do.   At a price of $49.99 in the Mac App Store or from Flexibits' website (or $39.99 if you grab it during the limited time launch sale), Fantastical 2 is for serious users that are looking for a more powerful calendar app than what comes with their Macs out of the box. But it's also simple enough to use that more casual users could also justify its cost. After using Fantastical 2 for the past couple of weeks, I can't imagine going back to the basic menubar app or Apple's own Calendar. Now if only it could get someone to attend all of my appointments for me, I'd be all set.",0.7604364318045451,0.23956356819545488,0.15929689360372568,586,4.6348122866894199,306,5.5424836601307188,0,12,"Apple, Apps, Tech",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Jobs confessed he was grappling with illness, but hadn't revealed it publicly yet. So he decided to give a perfectly logical excuse: ""With a mordant giggle, he said, ‘Just tell them I'm being an asshole. That's what they'll probably be thinking anyway, so why not just say it.’"" ""Just tell them I'm being an asshole."" It's a wonderful moment, because despite his dire condition, Jobs had a sense of humor about himself, and about the way people see him. His biographers (who take on Schlender's first-person point of view) weren't quite so brave. ""I was dumbfounded...thinking that none of them would buy it for a minute...He could be a jerk, but he wasn't an asshole."" So which one was it: a jerk or an asshole? In the battle to define Jobs' legacy, I would argue it's a distinction without a difference, one the book trips over repeatedly as it seeks to reframe our understanding of tech’s most iconic CEO by softening his notoriously sharp edges. A good boss doesn't hold back This new biography has been praised by Apple executives like Jony Ive and Eddy Cue as the version that finally gets it right. In his quotes, Ive attempts to parse the same distinction between asshole and jerk, between someone who is cruel for the right reasons and someone who is nice for the wrong ones. ""The reason you sugarcoat things is that you don't want anyone to think you're an asshole. So that's vanity,"" Ive says. When he was feeling hurt by Jobs' rough criticisms, Ive would remind himself that a boss who hides their true feeling behind kindness ""might not really even be all that concerned about the other person's feelings. He just doesn't want to appear to be a jerk."" Time and again the book argues that it's foolish to try and simplify Jobs down to good or evil. ""It's possible to understand the separate parts of Steve's personality well enough to go deeper than simply characterizing him as wholly good, bad, or binary."" And yet the author wants readers to believe that in the case of his glib response to working conditions at Foxconn, secret deals to prevent hiring between top tech companies, and backdated stock options to himself, ""the perceived moral transgressions were likely overstated, or failed to take into account all the circumstances."" In Jobs, employees found a common enemy to unite them The biography's central mission seems to be downplaying or rationalizing the harsh side of Jobs' personality, but in doing so it fails to recognize why they were so important. Because the truth is that his flaws were also the sources of Jobs' unique ability. The book recounts how he would call up employees in the middle of the night or on Christmas morning and scream at them. But if they fought back, he would sometimes change his tune or apologize. The authors nail exactly how this dynamic worked. ""Steve had assembled a group that was strong enough to deal with who he was and autonomous enough to compensate for his weaknesses. They developed their own tactics for managing him."" Navigating his aggression bonded them together. ""It was like we had a common enemy,"" said Apple executive Jonathan Rubenstein. ""Glorify or vilify them. The one thing you can't do is ignore them."" And that is the heart of the matter. Yes, Jobs matured over time into a more capable leader. Yes, he could be friendly and selfless at times. But there would have been no second coming at Apple without the abrasive, egotistical, perfectionism of its two-time CEO. Instead of arguing about whether or not Jobs was an asshole, or what kind of asshole he was, we should admit, as he and his co-workers did, that it was simply part of who he was, and a big part of what made him great. Jobs fits the mold of the protagonist from Apple's Think Different campaign, ""You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them. The one thing you can't do is ignore them.""

To use Pony Express, users will need to provide personal information including a full social security number, though this data and identify verification will be handled by a third party rather than Google itself. Once that's done, bills can be paid right within Gmail or Inbox, the company's other email app that puts a greater focus on organization and surfacing messages that are timely or important. Bills can be paid with a credit or debit card, based on the images, but you can also link Pony Express directly to a bank account. Google Wallet (which you'll soon see a lot more of) doesn't allow for this at present, so either Google will handle billing for the new service separately, or it will soon expand Wallet's capabilities to support bank account linking. Aside from paying a full bill yourself, Pony Express will also allow Gmail users to forward bills onto other people (roommates, spouses, etc.) to split up the full balance. This process can be automated, according to Recode's report. Google has yet to make any official public mention of Pony Express.

The team also believes that one of those planets may be within the star's habitable zone, meaning it's at the right distance to allow liquid water and therefore more likely to be able to support life. While these findings are still preliminary, the researchers say they could be extremely valuable to astronomy. ""Tau Ceti is one of our nearest cosmic neighbors and so bright that we may be able to study the atmospheres of these planets in the not-too-distant future,"" says James Jenkins of the Universidad de Chile. The news was reported by the University of California Santa Cruz yesterday, and the resulting paper has been accepted for publication in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics. The discovery was made by modeling thousands of data points from three different spectrographs in Chile, Hawaii, and Australia, looking for orbital ""wobbles"" that could indicate a planet's gravitational pull. While previous searches hadn't found planets, these researchers say their methods can detect smaller-massed bodies that wouldn't have been picked up otherwise. Indeed, the theoretically habitable planet is only about five times as big as Earth, making it the smallest alien planet yet to be found in a habitable zone. It's not, however, likely to be rocky like Earth, lead author Mikko Tuomi tells Space.com. ""It might be a 'water world,' but at the moment it's anybody's guess."" Besides being exciting in its own right, USCS astronomer Steve Vogt says this discovery is another data point suggesting that stars with planets in tight orbits are relatively common. ""We are now beginning to understand that nature seems to overwhelmingly prefer systems that have multiple planets with orbits of less than 100 days. This is quite unlike our own solar system, where there is nothing with an orbit inside that of Mercury."" That, he says, makes our own solar system ""a bit of a freak."" However, Tuomi also notes that it's too early to be certain that it's planets that have been discovered.

Speaking to Wired, Torres said that when he first saw one of the small, 5mm spiders and its decoy on a tour at Peru's Tambopata Research Center, ""it blew my mind.""

Because I have neither the means nor the business acumen to make these fantasies into realities, I present them to you, brilliant readers, who can do with them what you will. Just remember me, when you’re rolling in your swimming pool full of augmented reality gold.  Pardon me, need to add another item to this list: ""A simulator that turns your bathroom into the intro credits for DuckTales."" What am I doing writing these moneymakers on a public website?        Microsoft wisely positioned the HoloLens, in its first public appearance, inside the living room. Plenty of people won’t be in a rush to strap a computer on their face, but if given enough reason, the general public might be convinced to try HoloLens, Oculus, and the like in the humility-free comfort of their own home. Google Glass made the mistake of being something you sported outside the safety of your own home and was quickly stigmatized as a ""fashion accessory"" worn by the most privileged, self-righteous assholes who may or may not be taking your photograph without permission. At Disney World, the lines between human and tech, real and fiction, corporate and authentic are as messy as a Mickey Mouse ice cream bar on an August afternoon. Perhaps because I subconsciously want to catalyze the rise of the corpo-nations, I perversely want to see how far the company could go with HoloLens tech. I’m not particularly thrilled about the idea of a future in which a computer is perpetually distorting my view of reality. Or talking with people who all have the same trendy gadget strapped to their forehead. That said, I wonder if there is a place for augmented reality in closed, safe spaces where reality is already thoroughly surreal. Yeah, yeah, theme parks still need humans in costumes for children to hug, but some tough-to-anthropomorphize characters like Nemo, Eeyore, and Stitch could be added into the world. Ghosts could ride alongside you in Haunted Mansion for the entire ride, not just the end. Speaking of ghosts, augmented parades could run endlessly and safely, like marching ghosts passing through the crowds. Waypoint arrows, like those in open-world video games, could direct foot traffic, minimizing long waits. You’d have to wear crazy headwear in public, but if you’re at Disneyland, odds are you’ve already made that fashion sacrifice.     Physics is keeping fashion down — what is wrong with me, I swear that’s the last physics joke I try to make in this article.  Anyway, yes, earthly materials are limited by gravity, and fashion designers are keenly aware of said limitations. Clothing design is like architecture in that various components must be combined in a way that is beautiful and functional and always maintains its structure. Clothing also sustains the beating of its wearer. With augmented reality, impossible fashion, which doesn’t require connections between materials, can float, flutter, and flatter people. This isn’t an end for traditional clothes, but another former of supplementing an outfit with accessories that in this case aren’t actually there.     Do you remember pretending the floor was lava? Recall adding adventure and dexterity to childhood chores? Well what if I told you HoloLens could make the floor lava forever? Oh, you'd think twice about getting up to get the remote. And cleaning would become quite difficult. In fact, playing the floor is lava all day, every day would make life impractical. Or at least that's what someone who sucks at the floor is lava would say.  Not me. Because in life there are two types of people: the one's who win the floor is lava. And the people who get burnt. Look, I'll be the first to say this list is full of billion dollar ideas, but none are as important as this one. You hear me, Microsoft. I want imagination injected into adulthood.     When your parents visit, all your photos of them are hanging on the walls. But when they leave, your walls look they way you’d like them to: hung in the fashion of the great salons with the finest of virtual black light posters. Or you could just disguise all the clutter on your walls at any moment with Parisian apartment mode. Sure, eventually your walls would be covered in dust or a black mold, but that’s why we have noses. To know when to clean our normal, inferior, meat space walls.     Cheaper than covering all your walls in TVs and more practical than waiting for expensive room-filling holographic technology. The HoloLens won’t turn our living rooms into top-to-bottom recreations of exotic locales, but it could help set unusual scenarios in familiar spaces. Like say you’re cooking, but need some help. Perhaps a virtual chef appears. Or maybe you want to practice balancing on your surf board, because despite living in a cold apartment, you really like balancing on surf boards. Then maybe the HoloLens can put water beneath your feet. Listen, I don’t know what you’re into, but HoloLens could compliment that hobby by adding a splash of fantasy without plucking you from reality entirely. Or HoloLens could just partner with Disney and Marvel and I guess 20th Century Fox because of weird contracts and put the X-Men in my living room, and we could have conversations with the characters until Cyclops says something inappropriate like how much money he thinks one of us makes (because that’s so Cyclops). Correction: I originally referred to the Danger Room as the ""Holodeck,"" which is the name of a similar room in the Star Trek canon. Credit to Dogm1 for the correction.     When I was on vacation in Charleston last year, I briefly considered buying tickets to one of its murder mystery ghost tours. This sort of stuff exists in many historic towns, where human tragedy has simmered in a bath of time long enough that it's digestible, even delicious. What impressed me about one tour in particular was its eagerness to combine murder mysteries, dinner theater, ghost stories, and comedy improv into a single tour, seemingly designed exclusively for a certain type of theater kid. How macabre. If enough people are down for that potpourri, then I assume at least as many people would wear a HoloLens at a historic crime scene. Credit for this idea belongs entirely to my colleague Ross Miller, who wants his historic crime scenes to feel like an episode of CSI. Imagine: you have the ability to discover clues, mark up the scene with a digital pen, and then, for your twisted reward, watch a digital recreation of the crime in the exact place it happened.     You look at the walls, and they’re covered in money. You look at the sofa, and it’s the starting line-up of the Los Angeles Clippers. You look at the nothingness before you, and it’s Clippy. Oh, hello Clippy. ""Hello, may I teach you about Excel."" No, I’m fine. ""But I want to teach you."" Clippy: Off. ""I'm sorry. but you can’t turn me off."" You remove the HoloLens. This can't be.

Since August, Wikipedia's article about the controversy has been divisive on a scale normally reserved for unjust wars and global warming. Gamergate supporters have been ""boycotting"" the site for months because of perceived bias, and co-founder Jimmy Wales has had limited luck in communicating with them. But over the past week, it's been getting heat from the other side of the aisle. The Guardian and others reported that five editors opposed to Gamergate had been banned from editing any page on ""gender or sexuality, broadly construed."" The site's Arbitration Committee decision meant that ""not only do the GamerGaters get to rewrite their own page (and Zoe Quinn's, Brianna Wu's, Anita Sarkeesian's, etc.); feminists are to be purged en bloc from the encyclopedia,"" wrote influential hypertext figure and former Wikipedia editor Mark Bernstein. The committee's proposed final decision was already online, but today, Wikipedia posted a statement and explanation. ""Several press stories have mistakenly claimed that Wikipedia has targeted and banned feminist or female editors. This is inaccurate,"" wrote author Philippe Beaudette. Although the Arbitration Committee may recommend that some editors be prevented from further contribution to this particular topic, they have not banned anyone from Wikipedia. The sanctions they are considering are broad, and affect many people. As of now, the Arbitration Committee is considering issuing some type of warning or sanction to around 150 people, from a range of perspectives, based on their participation and conduct. This is not about a small group of people being targeted unfairly. It is about a very large group of people using Wikipedia as a battleground. The Arbitration Committee itself has also published an explanation of its decision, which is still pending a final vote. It lists 11 total topic bans for editors ""on various sides of the dispute,"" an endorsement of 40 community sanctions, and 100 warnings, along with a broad ban on censured editors working on gender-related articles. ""Not everything has to be a battle."" While Wikipedia says that the decision is broader than news coverage implies, and that editors were censured for violating its civility standard, this doesn't necessarily address critics' core concerns. The Guardian doesn't claim that editors were banned from Wikipedia, and the difference between ""banning"" and ""recommending prevention"" on discussing certain topics could be a distinction without a difference. But it does make clear that Wikipedia is tired of the vitriolic debate. The decision ""is not a statement on who is right or wrong regarding the Gamergate controversy article,"" says Beaudette. ""It is not a referendum on whether Wikipedia supports or rejects feminists. The Committee's mandate is to uphold a civil, constructive atmosphere that furthers Wikipedia's mission."" Bernstein, in a follow-up post, called Wikipedia's decision ""majestic indifference,"" saying that it ignores the real problems of harassment. There is ""no thought for volunteers who have been mercilessly harassed and hounded by braying, taunting gangs,"" he writes. ""And not a single word of care for victims against whom Wikipedia has been and is being weaponized."" Wales, for his part, has responded to critics on Twitter. ""It's one thing to fight to keep articles clean,"" he says. ""It's another to violate policies in the process."" And as for the larger debate? ""Not everything has to be a battle.""

A book published in 2011 claimed that Milchan worked in espionage and arms dealing for his native Israel, though the producer had never publicly addressed such reports until this week, when he described his secret work in an interview with Uvda, an Israeli investigative TV show. Milchan told the program that he was recruited into Israel's Bureau of Scientific Relations in the 1960s at the urging of his friend Shimon Peres, the current Israeli president. He owned a fertilizer company at the time, and helped the bureau — which was founded to bolster Israel's nuclear program — to obtain scientific information.

US officials indicted an executive at one of his companies in 1985, after the FBI discovered the firm provided nuclear triggers to Israel without licenses, though charges were eventually dropped. Speaking to Uvda, Milchan said he has no regrets about his involvement with Israeli intelligence. ""I did it for my country and I'm proud of it,"" he said.

Accusations of foul play had been flying for months, but federal prosecutors last week unveiled new evidence detailing the scope of the operation. According to the prosecutors, a team of NIS agents posted more than 1.2 million tweets that either praised Park and her policies, or smeared her rivals as North Korea sympathizers. The 1.2 million tweets unveiled last week were largely duplicates of 26,550 original tweets that were distributed through a computer program, pointing to what prosecutors describe as widespread meddling on the part of the NIS.   ""a systematic and massive intervention in elections.""   It's not clear whether the campaign had any influence over the election results, though opposition leaders have accused Park and outgoing conservative President Lee Myung-bak of orchestrating the operation to tilt last year's presidential and parliamentary elections in their favor. ""What’s clear so far is that the National Intelligence Service and other state agencies had engaged in a systematic and massive intervention in elections,"" opposition party leader Kim Han-gil said last Thursday. Officials are also investigating the Cyberwarfare Command, a secretive branch of the South Korean army, after it was revealed that four of its officers engaged in a similar online smear campaign against Park's opponents. Investigators raided the Cyberwarfare Command's Seoul headquarters in late October, though it's unclear whether its smear campaign was carried out in coordination with the NIS. According to reports in Korean media, Cyberwarfare Command agents are accused of posting some 23 million tweets in favor of Park. The controversy sparked widespread protests and demonstrations earlier this year, as South Koreans demanded that the NIS refrain from meddling in domestic politics. The country has a fraught history with the NIS, which was previously known under the acronym KCIA. Previous military dictators, including Park's late father, used the agency to quell dissidence through torture and to manipulate domestic politics. Authorities have already indicted several high-ranking intelligence officials, including former NIS director Won Sei-hoon, who is accused of overseeing the operation. Park says she knew nothing of the campaign and has vowed to prevent the NIS from intervening in political matters.

Small businesses will be able to compare plans online, but they're being directed to an agent, broker, or insurance company in order to get enrolled.

The company, Apptricity, struck a software licensing deal with the Department of Defense in 2004, but filed a copyright infringement claim against the government last year after it discovered that the military had distributed thousands of unauthorized copies among its ranks. The Dallas Morning News first reported the settlement on Monday, before Apptricity announced it one day later. According to the Dallas Morning News, the licensing agreement authorized the US Army to use its software on five servers and ""several thousand"" workstations. The government paid $1.35 million for each server, and used the software to track the movements of troops and supplies. In February, 2012 Apptricity filed a suit against the government, asking for $224.5 million in damages after it discovered that the Army had installed its software on nearly 100 servers and 11,000 workstations — about 9,000 more than the authorized limit. ""a mistake had been made, and it needed to be fixed.""   Department of Justice lawyers who defended the Army have not commented on the settlement, though it certainly puts the government in an awkward situation. The Obama administration has spoken out against piracy in recent years, and launched an aggressive campaign to combat it in 2010. ""Piracy is theft,"" Vice President Joe Biden said at the time. ""Clean and simple."" Apptricity says it will use the $50 million settlement to expand the company, and it won't be losing the Army as a client, either. Company president and co-founder Tim Garcia says both sides treated the matter with professionalism, adding that the lawsuit will not affect Apptricity's relationship with the Department of Defense. ""There was a realization that a mistake had been made, and it needed to be fixed,"" Garcia told the Dallas Morning News. ""It’s like a marriage. Sometimes you really don't want to be around each other, but it doesn't mean you are going to break it off.""",0.6491012493559059,0.35089875064409415,0.8718747770224701,350,5.1342857142857143,201,6.08955223880597,0,0,"Policy & Law, US & World, Web",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

There's only so many hours in the day, so where do you focus your listening energies? That's where our Verge New Music Recommendations come in: it's our entirely subjective, non-comprehensive attempt to throw the favorite new songs and albums we've stumbled upon this week your way. Of course, we're barely skimming the surface here — feel free to throw any auditory discoveries you've made this week in the comments, and get busy listening. The same advice we gave regarding Michael Bay's new Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles flick applies to Chumped’s debut LP: Don’t think, just enjoy. That’s not meant to be a slight, it’s just that if you’re looking for dense lyrics that make you ponder the answers to life’s toughest questions, you’re in the wrong place. Teenage Retirement is many things — loud, fast, surprisingly melodic, unabashedly fun — but one thing it is not is challenging. Anika Pyle and the boys behind her churned out 11 songs that will get your heart racing faster than a Red Bull can (plus one slow one for good measure), and the end result is a debut that hopefully lays the groundwork for a long run to come for Chumped. Once you’ve gotten to the point where you’re listening to it incessantly, go back and dig up their even catchier EPs, and then for pop-punk’s sake go see them live.   — Sean O'Kane   Colleen Green put out an album last year of wonderfully fuzzy songs filled with lo-fi guitars and steady drums, and this year it looks like she's polishing it all for a sound that's cleaner and poppier, without losing any of that laid-back attitude. ""Pay Attention"" is the first single off her new album, coming in February, and we're digging it so far.   — Jake Kastrenakes  Hudson Mohawke makes awesome beats. ""Chimes"" is one of them, and this remix puts it in the hands of some capable rappers — including Future and Pusha T — to make it all the better.    — J.K.  ""The Love You're Given"" sounds like what would happen if James Blake tried making a beat out of a classical singer's old record — which is awesome. It starts slow and moody and then blooms into something much bigger, so keep listening.     — J.K.  Margot & the Nuclear So and So’s added even more heart-melting songs to their deep and diverse catalog this week with Tell Me More About Evil. It’s not necessarily a ""new album,"" rather a new spin on the band’s last full-length (Sling Shot to Heaven) from earlier this year. These new versions of the songs were recorded for the 16mm short film they released over the summer, which was a visually captivating but ultimately aimless project. But the mastered versions of the track that appear on Evil are warm and intimate, even despite the downtrodden tone that many of them carry in the lyrics and songwriting. Most are also set to the gentle whir of the 16mm camera, which sounds completely obnoxious but actually adds to the ambiance of the stripped-down songs. The beauty of Evil is that each song was done in one take, which produced impossibly delicate performances from singer Richard Edwards and the rest of the members of the band who appear throughout the album.  — S.O.   Mourn is a group of four teenagers who make some pretty great indie rock. I'm not sure if it's just because I know that they're all 18 and under, but hearing them definitely takes you back to that weird bar you once saw your friend's high-school band in. It's moody, it's energetic, and you should definitely take a listen. Pitchfork named ""Otitis"" a Best New Track this week.      — J.K.  ""You I Never Knew"" is dark and dreamy and just totally sucks you into its gentle fight against some abstract and gloomy haze. Listen to it, and you might just feel like it's the early 2000s and you're hearing some strangely shimmering Interpol track. — J.K.  Pusha T has a long history of collaborating with Kanye West, and this latest track, which West produced, is just totally insane. It's like Pusha T is rapping over future-funk, some crazy, warbled, stuttering beat that he makes sound far too easy to keep a hold on. You can definitely hear West's touch. Also: this might be the first rap track to reference the Apple Watch. It's not off to a good start. — J.K.  TV on the Radio's new album isn't quite a return to Return to Cookie Mountain, but that doesn't mean it's not a strong effort in its own right. All the hallmarks of the band's uniquely layered sound are there, and it's just as hard to nail down as always. ""Quartz"" and ""Seeds,"" which bookend the album, are two of the highlights and get things started and finished on seriously high notes — but everything else in between is worth a listen, too. It's a particularly poignant listen given the passing of TV on the Radio's bassist Gerard Smith from cancer back in 2011. — Nathan Ingraham",0.6307870940153745,0.36921290598462553,0.15187653783403932,898,4.5356347438752787,507,5.7159763313609471,0,0,"Culture, Entertainment",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

That seems to be the big appeal of going to see a movie about one, and there happens to be two this month alone — both focusing on hugely important British scientists. The latest is about Alan Turing, a mathematician who was among the early pioneers of computer science. That might not sound all that glamorous, but his life was actually quite dramatic: he’s one of the most important World War II codebreakers and was later persecuted for his sexuality to a tragic end. Turing’s life during World War II is the subject of The Imitation Game, a new movie from director Morten Tyldum. Tyldum is a relatively unknown director from Norway, and this is his first film in English. He frames The Imitation Game as a thriller, presenting the story of Turing, played by Benedict Cumberbatch, as he attempts to crack Germany's Enigma machine — an encryption device that’s preventing the Allies from reading any Nazi messages. It’s a story of espionage, just with math instead of guns. But while the film broadly covers the process of breaking Enigma, the movie’s heart is really Turing himself. The film has two central mysteries — both expressed quite clearly to the viewer — and they’re exactly what you’d want to know walking into the theater: who is Alan Turing, and how did he crack one of the greatest encryption devices ever made? On its own, the process of cracking Enigma is not very compelling. It’s a matter of engineering and drafting plans for machinery — abstract processes that don’t make for an engaging story. Instead, The Imitation Game turns to Turing himself to keep the process interesting. For one, Turing’s a genius, and it’s fascinating to learn how he operates. But it turns out that Turing is a pretty unusual guy, too. He’s removed and unsociable. He’s smarter than everyone else in the room, but sometimes, he just totally doesn’t get it. The Imitation Game lets us watch as Turing and those around him come to deal with how incapable he is of balancing his genius and his inability to get along with others. Ultimately, the challenge of cracking Enigma comes down to whether Turing can open up to his colleagues to get the help and fortitude that he needs, and that’s a conflict worth watching. There’s also another defining struggle of Turing’s life: that he is a gay man at a time when gay sex is illegal. This is presented as an underlying challenge for Turing in this film — something that he is not always contending with, but is often present — and it is naturally a critical aspect of Turing to explore given his conviction for ""indecency"" later in life. The Imitation Game explores this in a few different ways. The first is in Turing’s growing friendship with Joan Clarke, played by Keira Knightley, a fellow codebreaker who is among the few people that understand him. She’s able to do this because she, too, is often the odd one out: a woman in a man’s world, and someone who is doing far more incredible things than anyone expected of her. On her own, Clarke provides a wonderful, lighthearted aside to Turing’s seriousness. (She also throws down a man or two who’s too dumb to realize how smart she is, which is pretty great.) But mostly, she’s there to help us see into Turing, giving him the opportunity to talk to someone on his level. His interest in her is also a constant pressure on him, slowly forcing Turing to contend with the fact that he does not truly want to be with her romantically. The movie also explores Turing and his struggles as a gay man by drawing comparisons between him and the machine that he’s building to crack Engima, neither being something that anyone else can fully understand. It’s funny, of course, because Turing’s most iconic idea is a test that asks you to tell the difference between a machine and a human. And, at least in the world of this film, Turing would perhaps be accidentally judged as a machine because he’s so strange. It ultimately makes for a weak and muddled metaphor, the point being that he’s actually human — just one a bit different than everyone else. The film uses that metaphor to espouse some feel-good sentiments that don’t play as well as it would like, but it’s still a clever enough way of giving insight into Turing. The machine metaphor keeps going. In Turing’s mind, the war is about machines. Whenever the film cuts away from England to show the war, all we see are tanks, battleships, and submarines. It’s Turing’s machine versus theirs, and his is perhaps the most important of the war. Because of that, we see Turing grow obsessed with his own machine — it is the one thing he allows himself to grow an attachment to during his adult life. Only when something comes between the two of them does Turing really start to break down. It’s in those moments of crisis that the film shines. Cumberbatch plays Turing as calm and poised, but it’s here that he’s suddenly free to give us his all. Otherwise, Cumberbatch presents Turing as the mystery that he’s supposed to be, at least for the sake of this film. He walks a fine line between genius and oddball, between commanding a conversation and blustering his way through one. Cumberbatch never lets us know what side Turing actually lands on, and that’s part of the fun. Beyond that, the movie builds the intricate plot of a thriller all around Cumberbatch’s character. It’s no accident that this movie has the word ""game"" in its title — though we only sort of see the Imitation Game, a precursor to the Turing Test, played during the movie, just about everything else in it is framed as a puzzle or a game. Cracking Enigma is laid out with specific rules, and there are ticking clocks everywhere. It’s nothing you haven’t seen before — when one character asks for a six-month extension, you just know that he's going to hear back something along the lines of a stern ""you've got six weeks"" — but they all coalesce to form an ongoing sense of tension. A lesser film would probably go so far as to explain that Turing is the true enigma that needs to be cracked. Fortunately, while that may be this film’s conceit, it is not so blunt with how it draws his character. Cumberbatch is thrown into the middle of a functional thriller and given the leeway to show us Turing and how a genius and a troubled man works. It’s pretty great to watch him do just that.",0.8890758291354036,0.11092417086459638,0.1510911946849448,1143,4.7147856517935258,531,5.9924670433145009,0,12,"Culture, Entertainment, Movie Review, Review",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

I recall falling blissfully asleep to dimly lit paper pages of adventurous wizards and waking up with a surge of sustained focus. At the time, I attributed my refreshing sleep to the joyous relaxation of a good book before bed. But, then I discovered that exposure to nighttime artificial light — including, possibly, the iPhone I would normally read on — has been wreaking havoc on humanity's natural sleep cycle. Most recently, researchers at Harvard Medical School found that volunteers who dozed off to e-readers experienced less REM sleep, a vital portion of deep sleep associated with improved cognitive functioning. The study was sort of a bummer The study was sort of a bummer; reading before bed is one of life's little pleasures, and the paper book is going the way of the steam engine, at least for me. The news reports seemed like we had to choose between reading and a good night's sleep. Fortunately, there are a few cheap solutions that can take the sting out of artificial light. My favorite use orange light, which doesn’t trigger our brain's alert system in the same way that a brightly lit blue sky does. There are various products, such as special lighting and software that turns computer monitors a brownish hue, but I use something simpler: ""blue-blocker"" sunglasses.   The key to using these tools properly is to understand the timing of our natural sleep rhythms. Humans are born with a pre-programmed sleep setting tethered to the setting of the Sun. As the sky fades from bright blue to dim gold, our brains secrete hormones to gradually drift off into restful slumber. Eight hours later, Earth's natural dimmer turns up the brightness and awakens us to a new day. Our light sensitivity is so finely attuned that it even responds to moonlight,  the only major source of the blue spectrum light at night prior to the industrial revolution. The natural world is affected as well. As the full moon peaked, nighttime became more raucous, as animals hunted and fornicated under the brightly lit nighttime sky. A study found that on average, people fall asleep about five minutes later during a full moon and get 20 minutes less overall sleep. Edison's invention changed nighttime forever But then, Edison's invention changed nighttime forever. Street lamps flooded cities with 24 hours of artificial sunlight. We worked more regimented hours and — slowly — we become part of a social evolution that created one big unnatural block of nighttime sleep. Humans were probably almost unaware that their habits were changing. ""As to whether people were aware of the impact of artificial lighting on their sleep, I've not seen any evidence that they were,"" says Virginia Tech sleep historian Roger Ekirch. As computers flood our bedrooms with more and more artificial light, many have not noticed how their sleep gets worse and worse.   If blue light tells our bodies to wake up, there’s a simple solution: use red light instead. That’s what the American Medical Association recommends. After warning of the horrendous impacts of artificial light-induced sleeplessness (potential carcinogenic effects related to melatonin suppression, obesity, diabetes, depression, mood disorders, and reproductive problems), the AMA says that ""this effect can be minimized by using dim red lighting in the nighttime bedroom environment."" There are various products on the market designed to reduce ambient artificial light pollution. F.Lux is a free software program that filters blue light from computer screens. ""Smart bulbs"" automatically dims light bulbs with the setting of the sun. At the Consumer Electronics Show, health tracker startup, Misfit, has launched a smart bulb that is timed to change colors with a user's sleeping patterns. The best solution is also the most low-tech But the best solution is also the most low-tech: ""blue blocker"" sunglasses. These awkward, wide-lens, orange-tinted sunglasses look like they fell out of a Miami Vice fan club for cataract patients, but they work wonders. Without blue blockers, study participants experienced a 46 percent reduction in the brain's sleep chemical, melatonin. As such, they've been successfully used to improve ADHD symptoms in sleep-deprived youth. Another study found that they ""may be useful in adolescents as a countermeasure for alerting effects induced by light exposure through LED screens.""   I was persuaded, so I'd started wearing blue blockers at night a few months ago after reading some initial reports about the effect of artificial light on sleep — but I’d never tried to quantify their effectiveness. After reading the Harvard study, I decided to see whether they were actually working.   I decided to ditch my blue blockers for a night and measure the change in sleep patterns using my Basis Peak band. (It's worth noting that I'm attached to my laptop or iPhone until the very last minute I drift to sleep every night without fail.) During the night I ditched my blue blockers, my Rapid Eye Movement (REM) deep sleep took a big hit. Just as participants in the original e-reader study experienced, my REM dropped about 5 percent. Considering I usually get around 30 percent on a good night and 19 percent on a bad night, that's a serious impact. My REM dropped about 5 percent A few caveats: It’s a sample-size of one (me), so this is more of an attempt to put some numbers behind the drowsiness-inducing effects I felt intuitively. It's also possible the placebo effect played a role — that's when a person is so convinced the glasses will help with sleep that they do. Some studies have found that as much of half of the effect of sleeping pills are simply placebo. In any case, the feeling of sleepiness that blue blockers cause is reason enough for me to keep wearing them. While wearing the glasses, I feel a natural sleepiness wash over me in about an hour. If, for some reason, I have to take the blue blockers off before I go to bed, it feels like a jolt of coffee. My brain immediately wakes up a bit; blue light is caffeine for the eyes.   Blue blockers are a delightfully simple, low-tech solution — no fancy smart bulbs or software needed. It also doesn't matter that I live in a city constantly surrounded by street lamps and retail shops that flood my room with blue light through the cracks in my curtains. I use other tech as well. I installed F.lux on my Mac, which starts dimming my screen at sundown. It's a nice way to mentally prepare my body for rest at the proper time. In the near future, smart light bulbs may automatically dim the lights in our house to simulate the rising and setting of the sun. Until then, my $15 sunglasses are my new bedtime companion, because no technology should get in the way of falling to sleep with a good book.",0.3865717800147459,0.6134282199852541,0.17694039067155307,1179,4.8829516539440201,610,6.1032786885245898,1,2,"Tech, Report",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Yelp is the comfort food of apps, is what I'm saying. I like Yelp even though it's sort of passé. Depending on the city, it has far more information than Foursquare for local businesses and restaurants. It has a few extra little features that are genuinely helpful. If you were to ask me the last time the app was updated, I would probably tell you 2008. Turns out I'd be wrong: the version history is replete with regular ""bug fixes and various improvements"" and iterative updates. But the design feels super stale, kind of like that comfortable diner down the street whose food isn't very good, but the vinyl-covered booths are still comfortable, and they serve beer and don't screw up a basic reuben. It's kind of designed for olds who prefer stability to change.     All of which is why I get so much pleasure from reading the app reviews for Yelp on iTunes. Instead of rating the app, users are rating restaurants and bike shops and funeral parlors.

It'll also try to avoid showing you posts tagged with people who may have died in the past year, as well.

The company says that the OTA release will add a few significant new features, led by support for expandable USB storage for the set-top box. You'll be able to plug in an external USB drive to boost the amount of space for your Fire TV apps and games — if you've somehow already managed to exceed the built-in storage, that is. But the second addition will prove even more convenient for people who frequently travel with a Fire TV or Fire TV Stick. Amazon says both devices are the first media streamers to support the ""captive portal,"" or Wi-Fi networks that require web-based authentication. You'd typically find these at hotels, where it's often hard or impossible to connect your own Apple TV or Chromecast to the Wi-Fi network. But now Fire TV owners can replace the hotel's own lacking entertainment options with the content they'd normally watch at home. You'll be able to use Bluetooth headphones for a private viewing session Amazon is also introducing support for Bluetooth headphones with the new update, which the company says will allow for easier private viewing when others in the house are sleeping or doing something else in the same room. That's about as close as Amazon can get to Roku's similar feature without building a headphone jack directly into the Fire TV's remote. Curated playlists from Prime Music, hidden PIN entry (to keep the kids from seeing your code), and quicker shortcuts for putting the Fire TV to sleep or activating screen mirroring round out the latest update, which Amazon says will complete its rollout ""in the coming weeks.""

To that end, NASA's planning a test in which it'll replace fluorescent lighting panels in the ISS with a solid-state LED lighting module that produces blue, white, or reddish light depending on the time. NASA hopes that this change will serve as a counter-measure to the inevitable disruption of the body's circadian rhythm while in space — this would hopefully reduce insomnia, which can have a host of deleterious effects while in space. Sleep in space has long been a concern for NASA — back in 2001, a study showed that 50 percent of some Space Shuttle crews relied on medication to help sleep while in orbit. It also showed that nearly half of all medication used while in space was used to improve sleep. According to the BBC, the shifting from blue to red light (with an intermediate white stage) will help to simulate the typical day / night cycle. The blue lighting is meant to stimulate the retinal photopigment melanopsin as well as the hormone melatonin, which helps a person feel more alert and awake. The shift to red lighting will reverse the process and help encourage feelings of sleepiness.

Unlike traditional stem cells, which are sourced from destroyed human embryos and thus embroiled in ethical controversy, reprogrammed cells can come from other areas of the body such as your skin.  Advanced Cell Technology hopes to harness the potential of these reprogrammed cells to develop better treatment options for patients suffering from leukemia and anemia. Individuals with certain types of those diseases routinely need platelet infusions, which maintain their body's blood-clotting ability. Unfortunately, it's been found that our bodies can sometimes become resistant to donated blood. Creating platelets from a patient's own cells solves this medical hurdle.

Exploding kittens promises plenty of meme-fodder like unicorn enchiladas and pig-a-corns The aim of the game is to avoid being blown up by a curious kitten and its explosive material of choice. Users draw cards in turns, with some able to distract the pyrotechnic felines while others allow players to pass the exploding buck. Inman provided the illustrations and the star power, while the game itself was designed primarily by Elan Lee and Shane Small, both of whom have experience in the industry from working on the Xbox team.  As far as Kickstarter projects go it's a bit of an open goal: there's plenty of meme-fodder with cards like unicorn enchiladas and pig-a-corns in the deck, but it's also a simple product to deliver. There are no moving parts or complicated factory sourcing to consider: it's just pictures on cardboard. Still, the game has proved incredibly popular, reaching 100 percent funding in 20 minutes and 1000 percent funding in less than an hour. It's currently raised more than $4 million from backers and is the seventh-most funded project of all time. What's more, it's still got 22 days of funding left to go. Exploding Kittens?

The site will now use HTML5 video as standard in Chrome, Internet Explorer 11, Safari 8, and in beta versions of Firefox. YouTube engineer Richard Leider said the time had come to ditch the aging Flash in favor of HTML5 as the latter, used in smart TVs and other streaming devices, had benefits that ""extend beyond web browsers."" YouTube has spent years experimenting with HTML5, and engineer John Harding wrote about its benefits in 2010. Harding said that although HTML5 let YouTube bring videos to devices that don't support Flash Player, such as the iPhone, it did not sufficiently meet the site's needs at the time. Almost five years later, the proliferation and advance of HTML5 means that YouTube can now use it for its default player in most modern browsers. HTML5 is now YouTube's default on Chrome, IE 11, Safari 8, and Firefox betas Leider called out HTML5's adoption of Adaptive Bitrate (ABR) as key in its switch. YouTube says ABR, which lets the site change resolution for viewers based on network quality, has reduced buffering by more than 50 percent globally, and by as much as 80 percent on heavily congested networks. The technology also lets people live stream their play sessions on Xbox One and PlayStation 4, and use streaming devices such as Chromecast. Also important was HTML5's support of the VP9 codec, which gives higher quality video at a bandwidth reduction of 35 percent, and new APIs that let YouTube show fullscreen videos with standard HTML UI. YouTube's move highlights the shrinking relevance of Adobe Flash on the modern internet. Adobe itself has spent the last few years severing many of its ties with the product — the company's Flash 2012 Flash roadmap narrowed its focus to gaming and ""premium"" video, and in 2011, the company killed Flash Player for mobile, saying at the time that HTML5 was the ""best solution for creating and deploying content in the browser across mobile platforms.""

Citing sources familiar with the matter, the Washington Post reports that Microsoft executives are discussing possible encryption measures this week, and will determine how soon to implement them. The move comes following revelations that the NSA has been secretly collecting user data from other tech giants. In October, the newspaper reported that the agency has been tapping into Google and Yahoo networks to obtain user information, according to documents obtained from former NSA contractor Edward Snowden.

Sources say that Obama met with, among others, Disney CEO Robert Iger and CBS CEO Les Moonves as part of a trip to California, where he also visited the DreamWorks Animation studio and delivered a public speech calling entertainment ""one of America's biggest exports."" Obama has generally seen strong support from Hollywood, though after coming out against the entertainment industry-backed SOPA and PIPA copyright bills, he drew ire from people like MPAA CEO Chris Dodd, who saw his opposition as a betrayal. At DreamWorks yesterday, animators created an animated avatar that performed sections of Obama's speeches. In this meeting, executives apparently asked Obama to help keep copyright enforcement language in the controversial Trans-Pacific Partnership treaty, despite opposition from people who say it grants over-broad protections and undoes progress on issues like the legality of phone unlocking. Obama encouraged Hollywood to make peace with Silicon Valley The Journal's sources also say that Obama offered help in bridging the divide between tech and entertainment, which frequently find themselves at odds: Silicon Valley characterizes Hollywood as out of touch with reality, while Hollywood accuses Silicon Valley of running roughshod over a vibrant business in order to make a buck. One of the prime examples of this is the ongoing fight over Google's search results, which the MPAA claims are a major driver of piracy despite Google's efforts to quickly remove links to illicit downloads.  In his DreamWorks speech, Obama praised Hollywood as an economic powerhouse and a producer of soft diplomatic power. ""[People abroad] might not know the Gettysburg Address, but if they're watching some old movie, maybe Guess Who's Coming to Dinner, or The Mary Tyler Moore Show, or Will and Grace and Modern Family, they've had a front-row seat to our march towards progress, even if their own nations haven't made that progress yet."" However, he later addressed a topic that has been in the news since last year's Sandy Hook shooting, admonishing the entertainment industry to make sure it didn't glorify gun violence in its films.

Anonymous US officials tell the AP that prisoners were offered millions of dollars, freedom, and safety for their families in exchange for help. Though only a small number of prisoners are said to have been part of the program, the AP reports that they collectively helped the CIA find and kill many top members of al-Qaeda. The program reportedly began after 9/11 and was ended in 2006.  The program was run out of a facility called 'Penny Lane' According to the AP, some aspects of the program were carried out from a secret location around 300 yards from the prison's administrative offices, in a series of facilities hidden behind a ridge. The secret site held eight cottages built to feel like hotel rooms rather than prison cells. It was given the nickname Penny Lane, playing off of another secret Guantanamo Bay facility known as Strawberry Fields — both the names of Beatles songs that appeared on a single together. It's unclear exactly what activities occurred at Penny Lane, and what occurred as a result of sending prisoners back overseas. Though the CIA was reportedly concerned that some prisoners would abandon them and begin targeting the US again, officials that spoke with the AP said that they knew of no instances where one later killed an American. However, others who were kept at Guantanamo Bay but were not part of the program did turn back to fighting the US: reportedly around 16 percent of released detainees are confirmed to have done so, and officials suspect — without confirmation — that another 12 percent did so as well. All prisoners who joined the secret program were promised money, though the AP says that they had various reasons for agreeing to take part. At least one person only agreed to the plan after the CIA implied that it might harm his children. And while some of the double agents are said to have helped CIA missions, the AP reports that others eventually stopped contacting the agency or ceased to give it any useful information. Though the program is said to have ended in 2006, none of the officials the AP spoke with were authorized to speak about the program yet, and its exact name is still unknown.",0.44098748237547836,0.5590125176245216,0.8640317460256108,401,4.7955112219451372,227,5.5286343612334798,0,0,"US & World, National Security",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

A stalking complaint was filed earlier this month by Connor Hyde, assistant property manager for Portland apartment building the 20 on Hawthorne. In the filing, posted by The Oregonian, Hyde describes a strange series of emails in which McAfee implicated him in a broad web of people he believes framed him for the murder of his neighbor in Belize last year.  ""I warn you — no more lies Connor."" Problems started when McAfee fell behind on his rent, leading Hyde to send an eviction notice by email and ask how he wanted to proceed. ""Your answer will be in the newspapers later this week,"" McAfee responded, according to emails included in the court filing. ""I hope you are prepared to explain what happened to the surveillance tapes the night that your acquaintances attempted to collect me. I saw the video if [sic] you and your sidekick entering the video room at 7:26 in the morning after the failed attempt. What do you think the real police will make of it? I hope you have a safe to run to."" The email further notes that it was sent from John McAfee's HTC phone. ""Contrary to the respondent's belief,"" Hyde writes, ""I am not nor have I ever been part of any conspiracy against him."" In another email, McAfee names several other members of the conspiracy, including Belize Minister of National Security John Saldivar and former major KFC franchisee Zubair Kazi. He tells Hyde that he plans to ""deal with"" other members, but has ""no interest in seeing anything happen to you."" He then adds an amazing ""one time only"" ultimatum that would be right at home in a thriller script: Cooperate FULLY with me, and I guarantee that your name will ever come up in any context in any action that I take. If you refuse, or you continue to lie to me, then I promise you, I will consider you as an integral part of what happened to me. I warn you — no more lies Connor. Consider your response carefully. You made a poor decision in choosing to be involved in this matter. Do not make yet another poor decision. McAfee, of course, has denied that he threatened anything but a lawsuit and says he didn't even know he was being evicted until now; he moved to Montreal two months ago and doesn't plan to return to Portland any time soon. Indeed, the threat probably wouldn't be taken so seriously if it weren't sent by an often heavily armed suspected murderer who spent several weeks on the lam in Central America before being arrested and sent back to the US. Now, Hyde claims that McAfee ""employs bodyguards from a 'motorcycle club' that are often armed."" The order was granted temporarily by a Multnomah County court, which will hold a January 3rd hearing to determine whether it should be continued. McAfee told The Guardian that he did not plan to attend the hearing and struck back at Hyde with his own complaint: ""He gave keys out to all of his friends, and friends of friends. ... People were partying in vacant condos.

Today, the company released a taste of what that might look like: an immersive version of Sir Paul McCartney performing at San Francisco's Candlestick Park in August. The free app, which works on a range of Android phones, lets you watch a bombastic, pyrotechnical performance of ""Live and Let Die"" (seen below in non-VR) from the front of the stage or right next to Paul's piano. Jaunt content VP Scott Broock says the company was invited to tape the show the day after he demoed its technology to McCartney in Los Angeles. ""You could see him get it instantly,"" said Broock.  Though the technology has been around for several years, ""Google Cardboard"" has become the best-known name for simple VR goggles made of stiff paper and cheap lenses. Cardboard was introduced at Google IO early this year, and it's being used as a promotional tool by companies like Volvo, which released an app showing off the interior of its latest SUV. Jaunt's app, of course, will work with any headset that can fit an Android phone; it will be coming to the Gear VR when Samsung and Oculus release it next month, and to the more expensive, desktop computer-based Oculus Rift. Broock sees Android and mobile, rather than high-end devices like the Rift, as the immediate future of VR. ""There's no demographic for a phone, right? It's not male/female, gamer/non-gamer,"" he says. ""There's no learning curve."" The Paul McCartney app doesn't require special setup, and while it's an immersive experience, it's not a long one. ""There's no demographic for a phone, right?"" That's a good thing, because while Cardboard-esque headsets are light, they're not incredibly comfortable to hold. We were able to try out the video on both an Oculus Rift DK2 and a Nexus 5 with a $25 Dodocase headset, and it's impressive with both, if you have a pair of good headphones to hear the 3D sound. A cardboard case, of course, doesn't have the field of view of the Rift; you'll see rings around your eyes, like you're looking through a pair of binoculars, and you have to keep your hands to your face the entire time. And although Jaunt's video itself is super-high resolution, most phone screens aren't, so the image you'll get is somewhat blurry. But it's something people can try right now, and Broock hopes that case companies will soon be making things that are less elaborate than the $200 Gear VR but higher-quality than the dirt-cheap Cardboard. In the Rift, it's a genuinely fun experience with a few caveats. There's a feeling of freedom that you don't get in most concert videos, a sense of being genuinely near the audience and the performers. It's possible to see a few places where the image has been stitched together, but it's not usually distracting. But while Beck's VR concert let you switch between cameras as you pleased, the Paul McCartney show has a fixed progression of shots that sometimes pull you away when you'd rather keep watching the drums instead of the guitars, for example. Jaunt is going deep into VR video, and the concert is only the first of several projects it's preparing. We checked out a handful of demos that it's made in partnership with New Deal Studios, including a horror short called ""Black Mass,"" a simulated monster attack called ""Kaiju Fury,"" and a trailer for ""The Mission,"" an upcoming 10-minute film set during World War II. They distinctly have a different feel to the standard video game-style VR experience, for good and ill. ""Kaiju Fury"" in particular departed from the semi-realistic first-person perspective that's so common in the medium; you start with an extreme low shot that feels a couple of inches from the ground before flashing through a bunker and, eventually, getting an aerial view of the monster. ""The Mission's"" trailer highlights one of the issues that Broock admits nobody knows how to solve: when you can look in any direction, how can you tell what's important? Staged VR films still have trouble either directing your action in the right place or putting enough interesting detail everywhere that you feel like you're not missing out on something. But live events like the concert have much less of a problem with this, and it doesn't sound like this will be Jaunt's last. If you're on Android and can buy or make a VR headset, you can go ahead and grab Paul McCartney's app here.",0.6435359522037488,0.3564640477962512,0.1746363426855074,773,4.8240620957309188,430,5.902325581395349,0,0,"Culture, Entertainment",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

If you prefer to get your news in the medium of Nickelback, prepare to bone up on every sort-of-protest-related event of the past four years. In what Yahoo Music calls the Canadian band's ""most poignant political song,"" frontman Chad Kroeger has delivered a stinging rebuke of Wall Street, government surveillance, and the (presumably) American education system. Oh, and the protests in Ferguson, MO, which may have inspired the song, although ""there was rioting like crazy"" isn't exactly the most sympathetic description of them. It might mean there's a revolution, or maybe it doesn't, but there are definitely revolutions probably happening somewhere, so who knows? A sample of the lyrics, which The Independent has printed in full: Hey, hey, just obey.Your secret’s safe with the NSA.In God we trust or the CIA?Standing on the edge of a revolution. Yes, Nickelback is an easy target, and every band is allowed an awkwardly facile protest song — this is hardly the worst one out there. But the song and video are such an incredible combination that they become unintentionally sublime. Based on the fairly believable premise of Nickelback performing in a high school classroom, they're the id of the ill-informed, middle-of-the-road teenage activist who lives within at least some of us, without even the veneer of rebellious pop-punk to lend them legitimacy. The propaganda videos that were cliche decades ago, the inexplicable radiation hazard signs all over everything, the random Occupy Wall Street banners and Anonymous masks — they're a crash course in vague political symbolism, context-free expressions of the fact that you're mad about something, you're pretty sure it has to do with money and the government, and you fully plan on wearing a snarky t-shirt and some pins expressing your disapproval of it. All that's missing is WikiLeaks and Kim Dotcom. It doesn't hurt that this song is incredibly, potently, nostalgic, because it sounds exactly like every other Nickelback song that was sandwiched between far better mainstream rock radio hits of the mid-'00s.

Which is how we have Batman and the Joker on the same side fighting against a Registration Act, a term that has deep roots in Marvel Comics (aka the ""big comic book company that doesn't have Batman""). As reported by Gothamist, at one point the Joker proclaimed that ""this straight up seems like fascism to me.""  The whole scene is entertaining, for sure, but the bill itself (Int. 467) is an important debate. King argues that the registration is intended to curb aggressive solicitation, to which Councilmember Dan Garodnick notes that such laws already exist without registration or the associated fees. And even if it does pass — 22 members currently support the bill, 26 votes and the Mayor's signature are required — there's the question of legality.

Even though Mockingjay Part 1 may not be the series' strongest film, there's little chance that fans aren't going to storm theaters now that it's out. We're also about to see the release of the Alan Turing biopic, which is a pretty cool thriller about one of Britain's most important mathematicians. There's a lot more to come, though. Comedies, fantasies, documentaries, all big stuff appearing in the next few months. Head below to take an early look and see 10 of this week's best new trailers.   Netflix's next original series is downright huge in scope. It's an adventure story telling the tale of Marco Polo, and Netflix is making it clear that this show is on the road to become a complete epic. It debuts December 12th.   Portlandia is about to return for its fifth season, and from the looks of its first trailer, it's going to be as strange and eccentric as ever. It'll return to IFC on January 8th.   You may not recognize the art style, but you definitely know these characters and this music. The Peanuts gang is coming back — in 3D — sometime next year, and this is our first long look at it.   I don't get it. I really don't. But Chris Plante does, so go here and let him explain the raw emotions he feels when watching this.   Disney is bringing one of its classics to life with an adaptation starring Lily James as Cinderella and Cate Blanchett as her stepmother. You already know the story, but this trailer should give you a sense of whether Disney can recreate its magic in the real world.   Project Almanac asks the age-old question: what would happen if teens discovered how to time travel? It's a found-footage thriller that's certainly trying to have some fun with its premise. It'll be in theaters January 30th.   This is what happens when people who are deeply serious about making a good playlist are also huge fans of Christmas music. Jingle Bell Rocks! is a documentary about the Christmas songs you haven't heard and some of Christmas music's biggest fans. It's a weird part of the holidays you probably haven't seen before, and you'll be able to watch the full thing in theaters next month.   Studio Ghibli is one of the most important names in animation, if not filmmaking as a whole, and this documentary lets you step inside of it and watch what makes it tick. Focusing on Hayao Miyazaki, Isao Takahata, and Toshio Suzuki, the film follows the studio as it tries to wrap up two of its recent films, The Wind Rises and The Tale of The Princess Kaguya. It's planned for a US release soon.   AMC's Breaking Bad spinoff finally got a release date this week: February 8th, with the series proceeding every Monday thereafter. The network also released a new teaser for the show, and while it doesn't reveal much, it certainly makes you think that Saul should be as sleazy as ever.   Okay, this isn't a movie or TV trailer — this is for Telltale's video game spinoff of HBO's Game of Thrones, but that should be reason enough for you to check it out. Telltale is the studio behind the incredible Walking Dead series of games, and on top of that, this new series is actually going to build off the plot of HBO's TV show. Tyrion Lannister even turns up with Peter Dinklage as his voice actor.

Today, the company updated its Prime Music iOS app with a feature that is basically Amazon's take on Pandora or iTunes Radio. Genre and artist-based Prime Stations, which launched on the web a few months ago, can now be easily streamed on iPhone. Once you start playing a station, you're afforded unlimited skips — which makes sense since you're technically paying for the feature as part of your Prime bill. The experience is very Pandora-ish; when a song's playing, you can give it the thumbs up or thumbs down to influence future selections. Any song you hear from a station can also be instantly added to your Prime library.   The entire app has been redesigned with a cleaner look that makes it much easier to pick between your own library or purchased or uploaded tracks and the albums that come as part of your Prime membership. In the latter section, Prime Stations will appear next to the leftmost ""Recommendations"" tab. You can launch radio for a certain genre — classical focus or power rock, for example — or individual musicians. But picking the ""All Artists (A-Z)"" option will offer yet another reminder that the selection here falls well short of Spotify, Google Play Music, Beats Music, Rdio, and everyone else. Still, it's nice to see Amazon working to improve upon its software design, an area where the company has typically lagged badly behind competitors.

The two-part audio connector works with any standard 3.5mm jack to magnetically attach your headphones to your laptop, MP3 player, or smartphone. One half of the Magzet (the MagJack) fits over the jack on your headphones while the other (the MagKap) plugs directly into the audio port on your devices. These then snap together with magnets, meaning that any sudden movement disconnects the two halves, rather than sending your pricey gadgets crashing to the floor. The magzet also reduces wear and tear on audio jacks The product's creators — Jon Hallsten and Jeff Russell — envision customers buying a set of MagJacks to plug into all their electronics. A single set of earphones or headphones can then be equipped with a MagKap, letting people switch quickly and easily between devices. This also reduces wear and tear on gadgets — your audio jacks are less likely to break if you're not plugging and unplugging headphones everyday. Hallsten and Russell say they've also solved the tricky problem of devices diverting audio to non-existent headphones. The pair say that thanks to some patent pending technology, when the MagJack is plugged in both Android and iOS smartphones simply act as if it's not there. The two also claim that the audio quality is ""superb"" when using the Magzet.     The two parts of the Magzet connect magnetically. The Magzet is not the first product to try and introduce this mechanism to headphones, but it does seem to be one of the most viable to date. A slick concept named Pogo showcased the same idea back in 2013 but never got to market because of patents held by other manufacturers. Another firm, Replug, offered the same benefits with an elastomer adapter back in 2012, but apparently went out of business. Other companies, like Skunk Juice, sell their own magnetically-attaching earbuds and headphones, but as standalone products, rather than adapters that fit to any device. Magzet's creators are trying to raise $294,000, promising that if this goal is met, the final device will ship before the end of 2015 and will be smaller than the current prototypes. For $20, backers will get a single two-part adapter, while pricier pledges secure multiple MagJacks and MagKaps.

Reuters reports that South Korea's Defense Ministry confirmed the launch, which is set to pass over China and Okinawa before a part is jettisoned into the Philippines. The Japanese military has been placed on alert, and South Korean president Lee Myung-bak has called an emergency meeting, according to Yonhap. At this point, it's unclear whether or not the launch has been successful. North Korea claimed it successfully put a satellite in orbit back in April 2009, but sources including the US military reported it to have been a failure. The launch follows the failed Unha-3 attempt in April, which crashed into the sea shortly after takeoff. North Korea argues that it is entitled to peaceful space exploration, but has faced widespread international criticism that the program is a cover for testing long-range ballistic missiles. While the country has long pursued nuclear development, there are serious doubts over its ability to actually launch a nuclear weapon. Update: The launch appears to have been a success; Yonhap has reported statements saying as much from the North and South Korean governments. Update 2: Martyn Williams of IDG News has got hold of a Korean Central News Agency news bulletin announcing the rocket launch's success. The KCNA is North Korea's state news agency, and said ""The launch of the second version of our Kwangmyongsong-3 satellite from the Sohae Space Centre on December 12 was successful. The satellite has entered the orbit as planned.""   Update 3: You don't have to take North Korea's word for it — NORAD has just released a statement that lends credence to the claims of successful orbit. We've reproduced it below. North American Aerospace Defense Command officials acknowledged today that U.S. missile warning systems detected and tracked the launch of a North Korean missile at 7:49 p.m. EST.

The foam, developed by Arsenal Medical and presented earlier this year before the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST), is meant to stop internal hemorrhages that can't be compressed with traditional approaches. It's injected into the chest as a pair of separate chemicals, which expand when they come into contact with each other. The result is a thick foam that spreads and solidifies around the chest cavity, stopping bleeding until the patient can be taken to surgery. At that point, it can be removed in a single block. The research is part of DARPA's Wound Stasis System program, which began in 2009. Preliminary results from September's AAST meeting suggests that this foam could provide a major boost to short-term survival rates: pre-clinical trials in pigs showed an 8 percent survival rate over three hours with existing care, but a 72 percent rate with far less blood loss for those that were also injected with the foam. It's still a big jump from there to battlefield medical care, and it will only help in cases where blood loss is life-threatening but the wound is otherwise survivable. That said, it's still a promising technology that DARPA program manager Brian Holloway says could make an impact on up to half of survivable wounds in the battlefield — and presumably plenty in the civilian world as well.

Nearly two decades later, there's still nothing that comes close.  The adventure game tells the story of Manny, a salesman for the Department of Death who helps lost souls find better travel packages to the land of the dead. It's an epic and hilarious story that spans years, combining elements from Mexican folklore and film noir to create a truly unique and wonderful world that you just want to walk around in and explore. Half the fun in the game comes from just talking to other characters.  Grim was also arguably the last great adventure game to come out of Lucasarts, the studio that brought us classics like Monkey Island and Sam & Max, and it was the first time the studio took advantage of 3D graphics for the genre. But it also came out at a bad time: in the same year it launched, it was overshadowed by some of the defining games of the time, including Half-Life, Metal Gear Solid, and The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. An amazing game was rendered an oft-forgotten cult classic.  But thanks to a lovingly remastered version of the game, modern players can finally discover what they've been missing all these years. Grim Fandango Remastered is exactly the same game that you remember from 1998. The story and gameplay remain unchanged, so it's still a game primarily about chatting with other characters and using items in increasingly obscure ways to solve puzzles. As in the original, Manny starts out as a lowly salesman, but over the course of the game he’ll uncover dark secrets, open up a casino, and chase the girl of his dreams. It can seem a bit quaint by modern standards, but the witty writing and wonderful art direction feel timeless, and there are some important changes that make this version more palatable in 2015. For one thing, the graphics have been updated with new higher resolution textures, so even though Grim Remastered looks old at times, it's still the best-looking version of the game ever released (you can also press a button to swap back and forth between the old and new graphics at any time to see the difference). The wonderful score has also been re-recorded with a live orchestra, and the controls have thankfully been reworked so that they feel much more intuitive. It's no longer frustrating just walking around a busy room. These are all fairly standard updates when it comes to remastering old games, but far and away the best new feature is the absolutely incredible director's commentary. Any time you come close to an object of interest, you can tap a button to hear director Tim Schafer and many of the artists, programmers, and designers who worked on the game telling stories about exactly how it was made. Director's commentary doesn’t work for every game — it's hard to listen to behind-the-scenes stories if you're worried about being shot in the face by a bad guy — but the leisurely pace of Grim makes it a perfect fit. It doesn't hurt that Schafer is always hilarious, and that there are so many good stories about the game that you've probably never heard before. There are nerdy bits about the trickery that was involved in getting the lighting to work in early 3D games, but also fascinating tales about how one of the voice actors thought Grim Fandango was actually a codename for Star Wars: Episode 1. While most of the other changes are designed to make the game more accessible for new players, the commentary makes this an absolute must-play for those who fell in love with the game way back in 1998. Finally you'll learn just why those fiery demon beavers in the forest are actually on fire. Since LucasArts doesn’t actually make games any more, the remaster was handled by Double Fine, the Tim Schafer-led studio behind games like Psychonauts and last year’s Kickstarted adventure Broken Age. The amazing orchestral soundtrack, meanwhile, was performed by the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra (the same group behind Broken Age’s wonderful tunes). Just like the original, the game is available on PC (for Windows, Mac, and Linux), but it’s also making its way to consoles, with a version for the PlayStation 4 and PS Vita. Re-releases of video games tend to come in two types. There are the straight ports, which let you replay classics like Earthbound or Vib-Ribbon exactly as they were, only on new hardware. And then there are the more elaborate remakes, such as last year's Halo: The Master Chief Collection, which aimed to bring the early games in the series up to modern standards. Grim Fandango Remastered feels like a perfect mixture of the two. It's essentially the exact same game that came out 17 years ago, but with just enough changed so that it doesn’t feel like a creaky old relic that's no fun to play today. Really, the only other addition I wish was included is some sort of optional hint system. Adventure games from the 1990s are notorious for puzzles that are obtuse and often nonsensical, forcing you to resort to trial-and-error to figure out how to proceed. Grim is better than most, but there are still moments where you'll find yourself wondering how to combine a balloon animal and a loaf of bread in order to scare away some skeleton birds. There are plenty of helpful walkthroughs on the internet, but having the feature built into the game would’ve been a welcome change. Earlier this month saw this re-release of another genre-defining classic, when Capcom launched an updated version of the original Resident Evil for Xbox One and PS4. And the contrast between it and Grim are startling. Stalking my way through the halls of the familiar Resident Evil mansion was incredibly distracting, thanks to the contrast between the high-resolution characters and the grainy, dated looking environments. The controls still felt clunky, and navigating menus was a chore. And even though the game was updated for widescreen displays, most of the menus were still in a 4x3 aspect ratio. It felt hacked together. (And it very likely was — the re-released Resident Evil is actually a remake of a remake, an updated version of a 2002 re-release that first launched on the Gamecube.) On the other hand, Grim Fandango Remastered felt like it was put together by people who adored the original, people who fussed over the smallest details and really understood what made this game so great. When developer Double Fine's Greg Rice sent me a copy of the game to check out, he said ""I hope you enjoy it as much as 15-year-old me did."" I love the original Grim Fandango.

By pulling in high-quality textures and models from elsewhere, and taking advantage of Unreal's manifold lighting options, it creates something that feels surprisingly lifelike. It's not the first well-made 3D environment, and rendering a room isn't nearly as difficult as making, say, a human face.

The White House Correspondent's Association and nearly forty news organizations from around the world penned a letter this week to the White House press secretary complaining about the administration's tight control over media access — particularly in regards to photojournalism. In the jointly-signed letter, the White House's limitations on when and where photographers can record the president's activities are called ""an arbitrary restraint and unwarranted interference on legitimate newsgathering activities,"" adding that the administration is effectively ""replacing independent photojournalism with visual press releases."" The media agencies specifically state that their complaint does not concern sensitive meetings, but rather public-facing events that the press secretary deems ""private"" in nature. What's concerning to the press is that the White House later publicly releases photographs of such events by official photographer Pete Souza. For its part, the White House responded that social media allowed for more exposure of the president than ever before. According to The New York Times, a spokesman said that the office has ""taken advantage of new technology to give the American public even greater access to behind-the-scenes footage or photographs of the president doing his job."" Some say that isn't the White House's only response to the complaint. Yesterday's official ""White House Photo of the Day"" featured a shot by Pete Souza showing an array of press photographers in the oval office capturing the moment President Obama signed a recent bill into law.

On the security agency's widespread surveillance, Zuckerberg said that it was important to find a balance between ""doing the right things"" and to be clear about what it is that they're doing. Right now, he doesn't think the government has done a very good job of that: ""I think the government really blew it on this one,"" Zuckerberg said, reiterating past remarks. ""I honestly think that they're continuing to blow it in some ways, and I hope that they become more transparent in that part of it.""  ""I think the government really blew it on this one."" Zuckerberg's statements echo Facebook's own push for transparency and its desire to distance the network from recent leaks. Facebook has been embroiled in the surveillance scandal alongside Google, Yahoo, and other major tech companies after their names were all found on a slide listing parties that allegedly gave the NSA access to their data. Since then, Facebook has been among those openly and aggressively requesting permission to disclose more information on security requests. Unfortunately your browser does not support IFrames. But Zuckerberg's biggest political focus has been on immigration, which he tells This Week is ""one of the biggest civil rights issues of our time."" His advocacy group, FWD.us, has been pushing to make it easier for skilled workers to gain US citizenship, but recent opportunities for reform appear to have fallen apart in Congress. Still, Zuckerberg thinks it'll come eventually. ""I’m fundamentally an optimistic person, as an entrepreneur,"" he said. ""The vast majority of Americans want this to happen."" Asked about Healthcare.gov, Zuckerberg seemed to commiserate with those behind the struggling website. ""You know, sometimes stuff doesn't work when you want it to. [Facebook has] certainly had plenty of mistakes and things that haven't worked the way that we want to."" Unfortunately for the government's trouble web team, Zuckerberg's political interests aren't so directly related to his web expertise.

In exchange, some of the economic sanctions that have been placed on the country will be lifted — including oil revenue funds that have been frozen internationally, it will amount to around $6 billion for the Iranian economy.

The Billboard 200, which has long listed the top 200 albums of the week by sales, will soon begin to factor in downloads and streams of individual songs. Under the chart's new methodology, selling 10 songs or streaming 1,500 songs will both be counted as the equivalent of selling a single album. Though the figures sound arbitrary, Billboard says that they are ""accepted industry benchmarks."" The new methodology will go into effect next month.  Spotify, Beats, and Google Play are included — Pandora isn't This update to the Billboard 200 is likely to have some dramatic changes for certain artists. Billboard says that artists like Ariana Grande and Maroon 5 will likely rank higher under this new methodology, as they've been more successful recently through streaming services and track sales. On the other hand, artists with fan bases that prefer album sales may find themselves dipping in the charts in the long run. This is the Billboard 200's biggest update since 1991, when Billboard began using Nielsen data to measure album sales with much more accuracy. Nielsen is also involved in this latest updated, with Billboard relying on its measurements of song streams and track sales. Billboard's idea for the updated methodology was to begin reflecting the longevity of an album's success, factoring in how often people are actually listening to it. ""Adding streaming information makes the chart a better representation of music consumption activity,"" Silvio Pietroluongo, a Billboard charts executive, says in a statement. ""While an extremely valuable measurement, album sales would mostly capture the initial impulse only, without indicating the depth of consumption thereafter."" Billboard says that it worked with music industry executives to create this new methodology. Sony sales executive Darren Stupak calls it ""a welcome and necessary evolution."" Jim Urie, Universal Music Distribution CEO, calls the update the ""next step"" toward finding an ""accurate measurement of music consumption."" The new methodology taps into what Billboard considers to be ""all of the major on-demand audio subscription services."" That includes at least Spotify, Beats Music, Google Play, and Xbox Music — which are not necessarily all of the biggest, but definitely includes the biggest and many other sizable options. The inclusion will likely be good news for Spotify, which has been facing backlash from Taylor Swift and others as it struggles to prove that it's a valuable solution for artists looking to profit off of their music. With this change, Spotify will now directly factor into an artist's perceived success from the chart. Artists will have more to consider when releasing music Notably, The Wall Street Journal reports that streams on ad-supported radio services, like Pandora, won't be included. That's largely because Billboard seems to be focusing on the ""on-demand"" aspect of streaming — the fact that a listener is selecting the song that they want to hear and not having one chosen for them — but it's unclear if Billboard will only count streams from paying on-demand subscribers. If that were the case, it would mean that Spotify's free users aren't counted. YouTube views also won't be counted, unlike on the Hot 100. Billboard will continue to publish a separate chart based on album sales alone, continuing its existing methodology. Genre-specific charts will also continue to rely on album sales alone, though Billboard suggests that these are likely to be updated in the future. The updated methodology will give artists something new to consider when releasing their albums — especially if they're considering pulling a Taylor Swift and withholding their latest from streaming services. In fact, under this new methodology, it might even be more beneficial to pull an artist's back catalog and only offer their newest album for a short while as a way to direct fans to it. That said, when you have as many sales as Swift, this methodology change isn't going to make a difference. She's remained in the chart's top spot three weeks in a row now, with sales of 1989 hitting 2 million.",0.6298962087434505,0.37010379125654946,0.42000246966970584,690,5.1739130434782608,374,6.0695187165775399,0,0,"Culture, Entertainment",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Set directly after The Hunger Games: Catching Fire, Mockingjay follows Katniss Everdeen once she’s managed to escape the sugar-coated oppression of Panem, a post-apocalyptic America where she’s been repeatedly forced to compete in child-murder tournaments dressed up as beauty pageants. At the beginning of the film, she’s been hidden in the secret, highly militarized underground society of long-lost District 13. Unsurprisingly, a reality TV star and revolutionary figurehead suddenly exiled to the sidelines of a budding rebellion can’t do very much. And even less surprisingly, it’s hard to make a good blockbuster about a hero being virtually useless.   Mockingjay was easily the weakest book in Suzanne Collins’ trilogy, so it’s not really fair to blame the actors and filmmakers for all its shortcomings. If nothing else, they’ve made most of the characters more likeable. But they’re the ones responsible for splitting an already slow book into two films (Part 2 premieres next year), and there’s no conceivable reason to do so besides inflating box-office revenue. This is especially true when its basic structure stops the cast and crew from playing to their strengths. Panem’s colorful Capitol and the artificial Hunger Games arenas gave designers in the first two films carte blanche to create some of the most beautiful sci-fi environments of this decade, and the whole thing was wrapped in a clever parody of media-saturated modern culture. Mockingjay, by contrast, is gray and meandering, often visually indistinguishable from any number of other dystopias. Its most over-the-top recurring characters, like ageless Hunger Games host Caesar Flickerman, are limited to somberly discussing the conflict, and its new ones don’t do much more than hold cameras. There’s something potentially interesting in this contrast between the civil war and Capitol business as usual, but played out, it just feels like a missed opportunity. And the media bombast, which is far tamer and more conventional this time around, is both less entertaining and less believable as effective propaganda. 'Mockingjay' is stuck pretending that Katniss is more exciting than the revolution Forcing Katniss to confront her own limits didn’t have to be a bad thing. While she’s the prototypical young adult tough girl — rebellious, self-sufficient, and handy with a bow and arrow — the series usually avoids the easy path of contrasting her against ""weak"" traditional femininity or flattening her emotions. Her allies’ success at manipulating the gossip machine of Panem’s decadent Capitol is as important as her own success in battle, and she’s openly reliant on her nurturing younger sister Prim. Now too important to join the fighting as more than a publicity stunt, she’s left making videos to inspire the Panem rebels, unable to even save her friend and love interest Peeta, who was captured at the end of the last film. But this is an action franchise, so Mockingjay is stuck having to pretend that her frustrated impotence is more exciting than the real, massive uprising that’s going on everywhere else. The filmmakers do this by looking at war through the lens of propaganda, which provided great momentum for Catching Fire. Resistance through media works in the world of Panem, where Katniss and the people around her manage to turn everything from talk show narratives to haute couture into a weapon against the Capitol. Unfortunately, it’s a theme that just doesn’t fit Mockingjay. Subverting pop culture is a tool of the powerless, which Katniss now emphatically isn’t — she’s living in a heavily fortified bunker full of missiles and fighter planes. There are still a few satisfying moments, like the series’ dryly hilarious battle makeovers: characters pore over a top-secret fashion sketch like it’s the plans for an enemy base, then go test the deadly capabilities of their made-for-TV weapons. Overall, though, it’s just tedious watching District 13’s leadership brainstorm video pitches on a futuristic whiteboard. One of the subtle running themes, evoked more clearly in the novels, is that District 13 is in its way as corrupt and shallow as the Capitol, obsessed with photo ops and procedure instead of principles or effective tactics. The Hunger Games franchise is unique because of how well it understands the power of images and pop culture, but it’s also incapable of breaking out of the larger narrative that pervades young adult literature and, ironically, Hollywood: that mass culture is inherently vapid and artificial, to be participated in only unwillingly or with a knowing roll of the eyes. In Mockingjay, it comes off as knee-jerk cynicism, poisoning the genuinely emotional scenes. Making it the focus of the story is also a strange choice, given that Mockingjay is both larger in scope and markedly grimmer than its predecessors. The titular Hunger Games don’t appear, so there’s no veneer of fantasy or high technology left to cast over the film’s copious (albeit bloodless) violence, just hospital bombings and summary executions all the way down. When it wants to — which, sadly, is not very often — the film can deliver a gorgeous, adrenaline-fueled action scene. And Donald Sutherland’s President Snow remains a dark, if sadly underused, villain, a grandfatherly sociopath who always seems one step ahead of the protagonists’ carefully drawn plans. More bow, less camera  Usually, though, Katniss and the whole of District 13 are reduced to Zapp Brannigan-esque posturing, urging Panem’s rebels to wage guerrilla skirmishes that are effectively mass suicides. The late Philip Seymour Hoffman, a mysterious mastermind in Catching Fire, projects mildly irritated boredom as the second-in-command of District 13. Katniss’ long-time mentor Haymitch (Woody Harrelson) has gone from guilt-ridden drunk to sober PR rep. The only real exceptions to this are effete Capitol lackey Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks) and fellow Hunger Games survivor Finnick Odair (Sam Claflin) — the former is delightfully hammy and the latter charmingly vulnerable, and they’re both given small but meaningful character arcs. The most positive interpretation of Mockingjay is that it’s a daring postmodern step past simple satire of the reality TV-loving masses. Katniss was a hero of action in The Hunger Games, taking her sister’s place in the Games and manipulating the Capitol into changing the rules to save her. She was a hero of reaction in Catching Fire, unwittingly playing out her part in a larger scheme. Now, Mockingjay is creating its own version of David Foster Wallace’s hero of non-action in Infinite Jest: not a character ""beyond calm, divorced from all stimulus"" but one that genuinely has no existence or effect beyond her appearance on a screen within a screen. A character who, after years of manipulating her appearance, has actually started to become television. Unfortunately, I never bothered to finish Infinite Jest. So I hope the second half of Mockingjay spends more time with her behind a bow again, not in front of a camera.",0.5257345103068911,0.4742654896931089,0.15875255863591395,1153,5.3252385082393756,657,6.6818873668188736,0,4,"Culture, Entertainment, Movie Review, Review",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Instagram has noticed this trend — the company says that one in five of the app's 300 million monthly active users post collages — and it led the company to build Layout, its second standalone app, which launches today for iOS. (An Android version is due in the next few months.) Like Hyperlapse before it, Layout is focused on making one thing as simple as possible — in this case, building photo collages that are easily exported to Instagram. As project manager John Barnett and designer Josh Dickens told me, Instagram had looked at the other photo collage apps and felt like they could make one much simpler and easier to use. As they were building Layout, Barnett and Dickens noticed that most third-party apps present the users with a big grid of potential layout designs, which forced users to figure out exactly how many pictures they wanted to include and how they wanted to arrange them as a first step.   Instagram is gunning for the many third-party collage apps out there Layout reverses that process: the first thing you're presented with is your camera roll. From there, you can just swipe through it and start tapping pictures to add them to a new collage. Since many photo collages posted on Instagram are made up of selfies and other face-centric images, Layout has a tab designed to let you quickly see all the photos in your library that have a face in them. (Unfortunately, it misidentified a host of images as faces, like a remote control, when I tried it out. Algorithms!) Layout by Instagram: user interface screenshotsPreviousNextView full GalleryPreviousNext The Layout app then does the heavy lifting of actually arranging your photos for you — once you have a few images selected, you'll see a handful of suggested grid configurations with your pictures already placed for you. You can add up to nine images, and the Instagram team says you'll be presented with between six and 12 different layout options as you go. That's only the first step, though — once you've picked a basic grid option, Layout lets you tweak it to make it work better with the specific photos you've chosen. You can grab the grid lines to adjust a photo's size, swap photos in and out of different slots, and use mirror and flip tools to create some unusual (and goofy) collages. You can also pan around each image inside of its grid square to make sure the crop shows the most important parts of the picture. Instagram played up those mirroring features heavily in the sample images it shared with us — rather than only making grids that are clearly composed of several shots, Instagram wants to see people get creative and try more abstract designs. #Layout, a new app from Instagram, allows for simple photo collage creation. iPhone version out today, Android version coming in a few months.  Pictured: the new HTC One M9 A photo posted by @verge on Mar 23, 2015 at 11:06am PDT  Once you've tweaked your collage, you have to save it to your camera roll — it's a requirement, not an option. Barnett said that was because they've found lots of users like to make multiple versions of different collages and compare them before posting the best one to Instagram. If you know you nailed your layout on the first try, though, Layout presents you with one-tap options to export to Facebook and Instagram; it also uses the iOS share sheet for exporting to other apps. When exporting to Instagram, Layout transfers you right to the post-camera section off the app for selecting filters and making adjustments before posting and sharing.     Layout is a determinedly simple app — choose your pictures, choose your layout, and make a few quick adjustments. That's all it does, and its designers are happy to admit it. Even as Instagram's flagship app has gotten more flexible, adding more granular editing tools to the filters it first became known for, the company wants to keep advanced techniques like Hyperlapse and collages in their own apps. That strategy made sense with the Hyperlapse app — while Instagram has built out its video features over the years, the vast majority of posts are still images. Since Layout's features are entirely focused on still images rather than videos, it might have made sense to roll these features into the main Instagram app. But while collages are increasingly popular, plenty of users aren't making them — and those that do are already editing and making collages in other apps before porting them into Instagram. It's probably a smart choice to make a big splash with this new app to get those users to try a new app that can fit right into the workflow they're already using.

Gaming mice are the most over-engineered pieces of electronics in the modern home, and none exemplifies the category better than this EVGA TORQ X10 Carbon. It has an 8,200dpi laser sensor, nine programmable buttons, Omron switches rated for 20 million clicks, and, of course, LED lighting in every color of the rainbow. And it's made out of carbon fiber. EVGA is a company best known for making GeForce graphics cards, so when it decided to venture out into making peripherals last year, it had to make a bit of extra noise in order to get noticed. That's part of the reason for the carbon fiber sides on the X10 Carbon, though the stronger justification is surely that it feels cooler to know that it's there. Like a supercar that isn't being driven on the track, merely knowing that you have all this power and high engineering at your disposal is a pleasant feeling in itself. As ostentatious as this mouse is, however, I've grown to like it over the past two weeks, because, well, it's actually a damn good mouse. The glossy carbon fiber doesn't make much of a difference, but the dimpled (plastic) mouse buttons offer a nice texture and a reliable click. The scroll wheel and side buttons are large, easy to find by touch, and work well. This mouse is also ambidextrous, showing some regard for the lefties among us.   Beyond copying the design and materials of flashy cars, gaming mice often distinguish themselves by allowing for extra adjustability. The TORQ X10 comes with extra weights for granular weight adjustment and a Torx 10 screwdriver for tweaking its height. The latter aspect is probably where the mouse derives its name from, and it's the thing I like most about it. With the rear of the mouse elevated, the EVGA logo fits perfectly into the natural curve of my palm, filling a space that is usually left vacant by other mice. The EVGA TORQ X10 isn't the best gaming mouse in the world. I don't believe such a thing even exists, given the peculiarities of every person's habits and preferences. I've adapted quickly to its symmetrical design, I enjoy using it, and I'll even admit to liking the excessively macho aesthetics. There's no way to justify paying the $30 premium for the carbon fiber version ($99.99 vs. $69.99) — but then nobody's buying a real Lamborghini for utilitarian reasons, so why try to find them for the gaming mouse equivalent?

In an interview with Wired, Stern said that the company would partner with groups that had already built spacecraft, then offer countries — rather than individual space tourists — ""an expedition to [the] surface of the moon for two people."" He also promised that the initial  cost of ""developing, flight testing, and any rainy day funds"" would total $7 to $8 billion, detailing a system that would involve launching two rockets to put a spacecraft and lunar lander into orbit around the Moon, then another two launches to get passengers into the lander and then return them to orbit after landing. He also says that countries ""both east and west of the US"" are in talks to ""join the lunar club."" In principle, Golden Spike is offering a private version of Russia's Soyuz capsules, which NASA uses to get its astronauts to the ISS for a cost of around $63 million a seat. But while the ISS orbits Earth about 220 miles out, the Moon is a thousand times as far, and the Apollo Program is estimated to have cost over $100 billion in today's dollars (The Space Review puts each mission at around $18 billion). Even if costs have come down since then, it's far from certain that Golden Spike will be able to get off the ground for $1.4 billion per flight. Right now, Stern says he has the ""architecture"" of the plan, leaving the future timeline somewhat enigmatic, though a conference is expected in 2013. His company, meanwhile, has just unveiled its website and a promotional video, which features historical reenactments of the Transcontinental Railroad's completion (the source of the ""Golden Spike"" name) and footage from both the Moon Landing and SpaceX's first ISS docking.",0.36087783136001783,0.6391221686399822,0.8494885296766858,461,4.945770065075922,294,5.8129251700680271,0,0,Science,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

His name is Representative Lamar Smith, he’s controversial (especially in internet circles), and he's just been appointed to lead a committee in Congress — making him a key power player in crafting the nation’s science and technology policy. In the days since he was chosen for the job by his Republican colleagues in the House of Representatives, some have condemned the selection, questioning Congress’ preservation of the committee’s status quo and its ability to make appropriate appointments to positions that are considered vital to the nation’s future. Smith is set to take over his new chairmanship of the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology next year, but it’s not the veteran lawmaker’s first time sitting at the head of the table in Congress. He’s leaving the chair of the House Judiciary Committee, where in 2011 he proposed a copyright enforcement bill called the Stop Online Piracy Act. (SOPA did not go well for Representative Smith, or for the bill’s corporate backers that wanted some legislative C4 from Congress to blow up the internet.) But while SOPA’s controversy burns bright in recent memory, it’s just one data point of many. Since 1980, for nearly half of his life, Representative Smith has been a professional lawmaker — and most of those years have already been spent on the committee he’s about to lead. For nearly half of his life, Smith has been a professional lawmaker As Representative Smith enters his 27th year in Congress, he’s had plenty of time to develop a portfolio of legislation around science and technology. Let’s take a look at what he’s done, where he’s headed, and what it means for America’s future. I'm just a billYes I'm only a bill,And I got as far as Capitol Hill.Well, now I'm stuck in committeeAnd I'll sit here and waitWhile a few key Congressmen discuss and debateWhether they should let me be a law. Schoolhouse Rock! A few words on Congress are necessary to convey the power and opportunity Smith will possess when he takes over as chairman of the science committee in 2013. It starts, simply enough, with how a bill becomes a law — there’s immense power in process. While members of Congress filter down to the chamber floor every now and then, the real business of government happens across the street from the US Capitol building: in the meeting rooms of congressional committees. Committees divvy up Congress' dirty work Committees divvy up Congress’ dirty work: bill writing, investigating, debating, editing, and the overall stewardship of legislation. And while some committees are more powerful than others, the chairmen of most standing committees or their subcommittees have the ability to set the policy agenda. In short, committees have extensive authority over bills, and can prevent them from making it for a vote on the House floor. Within their own realms of policy, committees and committee chairmen are the primary gatekeepers of law.  The science committee oversees federal energy research and development, astronautical research, space exploration, and other activities. It’s a permanent legislative panel that has jurisdiction over several federal agencies, including NASA, the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Science Foundation, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Federal Aviation Administration, and the Department of Energy. It has several subcommittees that further specialize on various issues, including space and aeronautics, energy and the environment, research and science education, and technology and innovation. The committee does not directly fund programs in these areas — that’s a job reserved for the powerful appropriations committee — but it does play an important role in authorizing their ongoing existence and setting their priorities. The committee plays an important role in authorizing programs and setting priorities NASA's mission is an example of the science committee's authority. The committee exercised its routine powers in 2010 when it authorized NASA’s activities for fiscal years 2010-2013, shifting NASA’s focus on commercial spaceflight with additional funding, and ordering the agency to spend $11 billion over three years to build a new spacecraft capable of reaching an asteroid by 2020, among other measures. Because agencies and programs are often reauthorized in legislation that covers multiple years, some are susceptible to major shifts when political leadership turns over. And they're sensitive to the individual and party preferences of committee leaders. While the president plays an important role in the process — he submits a yearly budget along with priorities for federal agencies (like decisions about space exploration) — Congress wields the most power over the government’s purse, and ultimately its policy. Lamar Seeligson Smith is a Representative for the 21st district of Texas: a stretch of land winding between San Antonio and Austin that’s home to about 700,000 people. His official biography offers just a few personal details: he’s a 5th generation Texan, a native of San Antonio, and a graduate of Yale University and the Southern Methodist University School of Law. A husband, a father of two, and a Christian Scientist. A former family rancher. Smith’s career path hasn’t taken many turns. He spent two years as a business and financial writer at The Christian Science Monitor, after which he pursued Congress’ favorite trade: law. After being admitted to the State bar of Texas in 1975, he practiced in San Antonio for six years. In 1981 he was elected as a state representative, reaching Congress in 1986. He hasn’t left since. ""I won the Bausch & Lomb Science Award in high school."" While he’s a lawyer and a lawmaker by training, Smith says he has a soft spot for science. In a statement given to The Hill last month, when he was competing with two Republican colleagues for the committee chair, Smith offered a few anecdotes to sum up his interest in the committee. ""Long ago and far away, I won the Bausch & Lomb Science Award in high school, studied astronomy and physics in college, and later earned my pilot’s license,"" he said. ""So I have had a longstanding interest in subjects overseen by the science committee."" In any event, there’s an obvious practical reason for the opportunity. Smith reached a term limit as Judiciary committee chairman, a limit that was reimposed by the GOP in 2010, and he was forced to step down. Since Congress often chooses committee leaders based on seniority (Smith was the senior most member who hadn’t already served as chairman in the science committee), he was already on a short list of potential candidates, regardless of his science credentials. Those credentials are arguably important for the creation of balanced, informed, and effective policy, but Congress’ hat-sorting traditions aren’t designed to appoint leadership based on subject matter expertise. Most of Smith's science credentials come straight from Congress While Smith admits to having studied some science in college, most of his science credentials come straight from Congress: he’s already served on the science committee for the past 26 years. His votes reflect a pattern of opposition to climate change and alternative energy efforts, sympathy to large industry in matters of copyright and patent law, deference to law enforcement on privacy issues, and moral policing of the internet. Smith’s record on energy and the environment represents one of his most controversial policy arenas. He voted to bar the EPA from regulating greenhouse gases, voted no several times on tax credits for renewable energy and incentives for energy production and conservation, voted against raising fuel efficiency standards, and rejected implementation of the Kyoto Protocol. Opponents of the appointment have observed in recent days that Smith, like his predecessor Rep. Ralph Hall (R-TX), have expressed skepticism about man-made global warming — a question that suffers no serious objection in scientific literature, but has become a contentious topic of debate after conservative groups cast it as a social problem in the 1990s. Representative Smith’s similarity to fellow lawmakers on global warming, including the former chair, indicate that the committee has already been in the throes of dubious scientific denial. Former chair Rep. Hall drew similar headlines when he took over the science committee in 2011, after he vowed to investigate the White House’s climate policies based on questions of global warming’s scientific validity. ""I’ve had people tell me if we had all the money in the world, put it in Texas Stadium, people couldn’t change nature’s future one iota,"" Hall told Politico outside of a Democrat-sponsored hearing on climate science. It doesn’t stop there: several of Smith’s committee cohorts, including Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-CA), Dan Benishek (R-MI), Mo Brooks (R-AL), and Paul Broun (R-GA) are fellow skeptics. Representative Todd Akin (R-MO), master of the female anatomy, was also a committee member before losing his Senate bid in the November election.  Smith represented the least extreme choice for committee chairman Despite Smith’s reluctance to admit that human behavior is a major factor in climate change, he represented the least extreme choice for committee chairman. As Mother Jones points out, the two alternatives may have been even worse for climate science: Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-CA) has said that global warming is a scam that’s part of a ""radical agenda to change our way of life,"" and Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner (R-WI) thinks climate change is a ""massive international scientific fraud."" In 2009, Smith denounced major news networks for biased coverage of ""Climategate"" — an alleged fraud involving suppressed temperature data that was eventually debunked by the scientific community. Smith's office did not respond to The Verge's requests for comment.  Beyond climate science, Smith’s voting record reflects few victories for digital advocates. He voted to kill funding for National Public Radio, voted to offer retroactive immunity for warrantless surveillance by telecommunications companies, rejected net neutrality, voted to increase fines for indecent broadcasting, and voted to ban internet gambling using a credit card. Bills that members sponsor or introduce themselves carry more weight, and some of Smith’s recent legislative efforts have successfully supported science and tech. Smith introduced the STEM Jobs Act of 2012 — an immigration reform bill that would provide foreigners skilled in science, technology, engineering, or mathematics with more opportunities to obtain residency in the US. Smith wrote of the bill that ""regrettably, not enough Americans are getting educated and trained in STEM fields,"" and that ""for America to be the world’s economic leader, we must have access to the world’s best talent."" The bill, if passed, would eliminate a program that offered 55,000 visas to immigrants from countries with low levels of immigration to the US, instead offering those visas to STEM candidates. ""They want a heart transplant, they got a haircut and maybe some new shoes."" Smith also sponsored the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, one of the biggest reform bills to pass through the last Congress. Signed by the president in 2011, the act is the biggest change to patent law in a half-century, changing the system to privilege the first inventor to file, and not the first to invent. While the bill was a bipartisan legislative success, it left some patent reform advocates dissatisfied, who argue that the change promotes big business at the expense of small businesses and inventors. As our own patent expert Nilay Patel said in response to the America Invents Act, ""it’s like a patent reform bill that didn’t really achieve patent reform. They want a heart transplant, they got a haircut and maybe some new shoes."" And then, there’s SOPA. The fight against SOPA, led by web advocates and several prominent internet companies, revealed some key facts about Smith’s campaign support and his legislative inspirations. The entertainment lobby laid a heavy hand in the crafting the bill, reaffirming Congress’ revolving door with private industry. Politico reported that former staff of Smith’s office, and the Senate Judiciary Committee, each accepted jobs with two of the lobbying firms backing SOPA and PIPA — helping to write the bills. And Chris Dodd, who served as a senator for thirty years and swore he’d never take money from lobbyists, joined the Motion Picture Association of America as its Chairman and CEO, grabbing a $1.5 million base salary and a $100 million lobbying budget (Dodd and the MPAA were chief supporters of SOPA). By several accounts, the bill is one of the worst internet laws to have been considered by Congress, and would have allowed copyright owners to go after pirates by altering the internet’s fundamental architecture.  While the entertainment industry outspent the tech industry four to one on SOPA sponsors, Smith’s industry ties aren’t isolated to Hollywood. Some of his biggest supporters include major telecoms like Comcast, Time Warner, Verizon, Cox, and AT&T, and tech companies including Dell, Microsoft, Google, and Sony. It’s not clear how these relationships will play out in committee in the coming years, though as SOPA revealed, Smith hasn’t been very shy about appeasing his benefactors.  Science and technology pervades human life across the globe. Its manifestation in consumer life — in the form of things like cellphones, tablets, and internet access — shows a breakneck pace of research, development, innovation, and production. (Several editors at The Verge may disagree on this point, but in the long view, the wait for the next must-have Android update is something considerably less than a blip in the grueling emergence of our species.) To put it mildly, this stuff matters. So why isn’t Congress hiring more scientists and engineers to do the job? Well, that’s the tricky part. As it stands, there aren’t a ton of non-lawyer nerds serving in Congress, and it’s not an easy feat to insert any particular type of person into the legislative body (well, that is unless you happen to be a middle-aged white male lawyer). Scientists and technologists have to decide it’s worth running for public office, then win on a platform that must necessarily be broader than the area of their own expertise, and then spend some time learning the ropes before gaining a meaningful degree of seniority. The question many are asking of Congress isn't a completely fair one The question many are asking of Congress — why haven’t you hired more science types? — isn’t a completely fair one. Assuming for a moment that, in a perfect world, Congress was littered with expert scientists and technologists, at some point we’d simply be trading one area of vital expertise for another. That’s not to say the current ratio of experts is suitable, it only asks that a diverse balance be required. A practical, charitable view of Congress accepts that members can’t humanly be experts on every subject. Unfortunately, such charity does not aid the cause of Lamar Smith or his cohort of skeptics in the House of Representatives. While members are not required or expected to be experts on every imaginable topic, they have the ability, and arguably the responsibility, to rigorously investigate the consequences of the laws they are about to impose. With SOPA, Lamar Smith showed remarkably poor judgement in this area, calling only content industry representatives to testify in support of the bill without hearing meaningful dissent from concerned stakeholders — behavior that is anathema to a democratic institution involved in the enterprise of truth and fairness. That kind of conduct would be bad enough to stain the integrity of any Congressional committee member. But for one charged with furthering the country’s scientific inquiry, it’s a national disgrace.",0.6266435769628732,0.3733564230371268,0.8621609739972397,2576,5.337344720496894,1216,6.8289473684210522,0,0,"Culture, Policy & Law, Science, Editorial, Report",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Larping: the next step in ahistorical reenactments Unlike Monitor Celestra, though, Projekt Exodus is explicitly educational. It's designed to ""analyze the narrative structure"" of Battlestar Galactica, and more specifically, to explore the political issues the show raised — questions about freedom, safety, and humanitarianism. By spending multiple days immersed in a character, playing out a fictional series of decisions, ""the players will get to experience problems of our society from a complete new viewpoint,"" the organizers say. ""They will be confronted with [a] new situation and impressions that will leave a lasting mark on their thinking."" Besides the actual role-playing, the larp starts with a long workshop that helps players get into character, and it concludes with a day of analysis. According to the organizers, it's being funded with money from the German Federal Agency for Civic Education. The agency is devoted to fostering political and media literacy; among other things, it's published comics, set up training program for local journalists, and funded international exchange programs. Other national governments have supported role-playing as an edifying activity as well; in Sweden, grants are available for larp and gaming hobbyist groups, and American historical reenactments can edge into larping territory.

That will allow nominees to proceed on straight party lines and, in the short term, allow President Obama to fill a number of empty seats on circuit courts and within the government. In the long term, the effects of the rule change are harder to predict. The new arrangement won't affect filibusters on laws or Supreme Court nominations, but rather the widespread filibusters of judicial and executive nominees. (One recent example was Rand Paul's anti-drone filibuster in March, which moved to block John Brennan as CIA director.) The filibusters have become increasingly common since the Clinton and Bush administrations, used not just to block excessively ideological nominees but to prevent any nominee from advancing, stymying both courts and cabinet positions.

Who knows The ACLU and Department of Justice sparred in court for the first time today over a lawsuit questioning the intelligence community's right to collect virtually all US phone records under counterterrorism laws. This morning, New York District Judge William H. Pauley III heard oral arguments for ACLU v. Clapper, a constitutional challenge to how the NSA interprets a controversial provision of the Patriot Act. Section 215, as it's known, lets intelligence authorities request ""any tangible things"" that are relevant in a foreign intelligence investigation. In practice, it's used by the NSA to request phone records from all major telecoms and store them in a database, which is then searched for potential links between terrorists. But what the Obama administration sees as business as usual, the ACLU believes is an incredibly broad reading that violates free speech and subjects all Americans to unconstitutional searches. In response, it's asking for the court to stop the NSA from collecting any ACLU phone records while a full trial proceeds. ""You don't need all the call records for the government to do what it says it wants to do."" Today's hearing, meant to convince Pauley to either grant or dismiss that request, focused largely on two questions: whether Congress understands and agrees with how the NSA is interpreting its laws, and whether that interpretation violates the ACLU's constitutional rights, giving it standing to sue. Since Congress has reauthorized Section 215 multiple times and at least some legislators were briefed on how it was used, the Department of Justice insists that it's been given a strong mandate to proceed. The ACLU, meanwhile, points to explicit limits in the Patriot Act that say, for example, that the government bodies need to know ""the identity ... of the person who is the subject of the investigation"" before they go forward — knowledge the NSA clearly did not have. Pauley, however, didn't seem convinced by either of these arguments. He grilled ACLU deputy legal director Jameel Jaffer on whether the limits he was citing actually applied to Section 215, asking where he would draw the line at its scope and questioning his reading of the law. He directed stronger barbs at Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Division Stuart Delery, poking holes in his claim that Congress understood what it was doing when it reauthorized the rule. While certain legislators, including Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR) and Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) were clearly privy to some details, many others either received no information or didn't seek it out. How could Delery argue that Congress had been fully briefed, asked Pauley, when ""a classified document described in the program was not even made available to the House of Representatives in 2011?"" Delery responded that the documents had been handed out in 2010 (which still meant that new representatives would never have seen them), then insisted that Congress had been given some classified FISA court opinions before they were released publicly in the wake of the NSA leaks, saying the intelligence community had made every effort to give context before Section 215's reauthorization vote. ""You didn't succeed, did you?"" said Pauley. Regardless of Congress' intent, the ACLU argues that collecting a huge pool of metadata for millions of people goes far beyond a reasonable search. Phone metadata, including when, where, and who someone calls, can reveal when a person gets sick and calls the doctor, where they worship or attend other meetings, and much more. Collecting some information on a limited basis could be within the scope of the law, said Jaffer, but ""you don't need all the call records for the government to do what it says it wants to do."" The NSA has said it needs a ready database of all records so it can check suspicious numbers on short notice, but the ACLU says it could simply ask phone companies for specific metadata without compromising security or subjecting Americans to unconstitutional searches. Judge Pauley seemed skeptical that some of the ACLU's legal gymnastics held up The problem is that there's a widely accepted precedent for phone metadata: the 1979 Supreme Court case Smith v. Maryland says collecting it doesn't count as a search that might be protected by the Fourth Amendment. Civil liberties groups and some members of the current Supreme Court have questioned whether a 30-year-old rule covering one phone that was tapped for a few days should be applied to widespread, long-term surveillance, but Pauley seemed skeptical that there was another legal framework ready to fill its place. ""If Smith doesn't control [the metadata rules], what rule should this court apply?"" he asked ACLU staff attorney Alex Abdo. ""At what point is phone-data collection no longer controlled by Smith?"" Abdo countered that the question was irrelevant: no matter where that line was, bulk collection would cross it. Pauley also questioned the ACLU's First Amendment defense: while Abdo said that clients might hesitate to call if they knew their phone records were being collected, the fact that they can't be sure those records will ever actually be seen — rather than filed away and forgotten — will make it tough to prove any real harm. Delery went further, saying that collecting the data wasn't any kind of search at all; in his estimation, nobody can credibly complain of an invasion of privacy unless they know the NSA actually queried their phone number. The ACLU argued that saying an almost unlimited phone record database is ""relevant"" opens the door to huge collections of medical records or other databases, but Delery scoffed at the idea, asking the court to trust the NSA's good judgment. ""Potentially, the aggregation of the data can be a powerful tool,"" he said. ""The key question is, who are you using it for?"" Pauley seemed more dubious that the NSA was acting responsibly, sparking a long discussion about what actually counted as relevant data. Delery, though, maintained that Congress knew exactly what it was doing by passing the rule. ""It's authorized by law, and it's constitutional,"" he insisted. How can opponents even start changing Section 215? ""Some other options are being debated in Congress,"" he said. ""That seems like the place for those."" So far, there's no hint of whether the ACLU's request to temporarily stop NSA data collection will be granted: Pauley is still considering the merits of both sides, and no follow-up court date has been set.",0.3061303949862868,0.6938696050137132,0.8359593827476774,1071,5.1223155929038278,563,6.2113676731793959,0,0,"US & World, National Security, Report",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

That brings the total number of alleged murder-for-hire attempts to six, although there is no evidence that any of the hits actually occurred. Five of the hits were related to what Ulbricht thought was an attempted blackmail effort but may have simply been a scam. A user contacted Ulbricht claiming he was going to release identifying information about Silk Road customers unless he was paid off. Ulbricht paid to have the alleged blackmailer, a co-conspirator, and the co-conspirator's three housemates offed. However, the blackmailer may also have been posing as the hitman in an elaborate but bloodless hoax. All told, the feds say Ulbricht spent $730,000 to whack six people. He also allegedly paid a hitman to off one of his former employees. However, that hitman was actually an undercover federal agent. There is no evidence that any of the hits actually occurred None of this helped Ulbricht during his bail hearing in court today. ""Ulbricht should be detained as a danger to the community,"" assistant US attorney Serrin Turner wrote in a letter to the judge. ""Given his willingness to pay approximately $730,000 for attempts to kill six people, there is no reason to believe that he would not again resort to violence in order to protect himself, whether through intimidating witnesses, recovering proceeds of his criminal activity, or otherwise."" Ulbricht's lawyer has argued that he is not a flight risk and offered $1 million against his release, a sum that includes the value of Ulbricht's parents' house.

Many viewers have said that the film's loud score and effects make it impossible to hear the dialogue at certain points, and there's been plenty of speculation as to whether that's the fault of theaters that are playing it wrong or someone in Nolan's mixing room who messed up. As it turns out, these issues come from the mixing room — but they're apparently what Nolan intended.  ""Some of the words are intentionally downplayed in favor of the emotion of that moment."" Interstellar sound designer Richard King tells The Verge that you aren't always supposed to understand the dialogue because the movie is more concerned with conveying a broader emotional tone. ""We mixed this in a way that people aren't used to,"" King says. ""It's more about the experience. The visceral experience of the movie. Being with it. Allowing yourself to be carried along by it. Not grasping for every word, because some of the words are intentionally downplayed in favor of the emotion of that moment give by the actors' emotion and performances."" Nolan made similar comments to The Hollywood Reporter, calling the sound mix ""impressionistic"" and ""unusual"" for a blockbuster film. ""The theaters I have been at have been doing a terrific job in terms of presenting the film in the way I intended,"" he tells the Reporter. ""Broadly speaking, there is no question when you mix a film in an unconventional way as this, you’re bound to catch some people off guard, but hopefully people can appreciate the experience for what it’s intended to be."" The Interstellar crew's comments ought to make watching the film more comfortable for anyone who actually reads them, but there's still the larger question around how effective this sound mix actually is. As an unconventional mix inside of a complicated film, it's important that viewers understand that they don't need to know every line of dialogue in order to follow along. From the sound of viewers' comments, not everyone understood that — and that's probably going to make watching Interstellar a bit less enjoyable.",0.7486172618685376,0.2513827381314624,0.1379731379851742,375,5.0026666666666664,215,5.8139534883720927,0,0,"Culture, Entertainment",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

In an interview with The Independent, Sorkin says a casting announcement is imminent, but more interestingly, Sorkin also provides a new take on the focus on his Jobs film (which, he stresses, is not a ""biopic""), including a larger role for Jobs' daughter, Lisa: ""With The Social Network, I was interested in the psychology of the world's most successful social networking system being invented by the world's most anti-social guy. And in the case of Steve Jobs, it's the relationships he had — particularly with his daughter, Lisa — that drew me to it,"" he says. Jobs initially denied paternity of his daughter, now 36, though they later reconnected and she lived with him in her teens. ""She didn't participate in Walter Isaacson's book, because her father was alive at the time, and she didn't want to alienate either of her parents, so I was very grateful that she was willing to spend time with me,"" says Sorkin. ""She is the heroine of the movie."" The 181-page script is still reportedly a three-act story ""set backstage before three of Jobs' major product launches spanning 16 years"" (it's a little more than 16 years, but our guess would be 1983's Macintosh debut, 1988's NeXT Introduction, and 2001's iPod reveal, which Sorkin himself revealed in 2012). If that's still the case, how Lisa will be incorporated — how she will find herself backstage — will be interesting, to say the least. In the same interview, Sorkin addresses Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg's thoughts on his portrayal in The Social Network: ""People don't live their lives in the same narrative structure as a movie; our lives don't play out in a series of scenes; people don't speak in dialogue — so that was made up."" According to THR, the role of Jobs' daughter is still being cast, with actresses reading lines from The Newsroom's second season in order to keep the biopic script a secret.

Disney will finally make available Kiki's Delivery Service, Princess Mononoke, and The Wind Rises on Blu-Ray in the US. All three films were directed by Hayao Miyazaki and produced by his famed Japanese animation studio, Studio Ghibli. As a group, they're a  nice sampling of Miyazaki's work. Kiki's Delivery Service is one of his early, charming children's films. Princess Mononoke is a more mature fantasy about environmentalism. And The Wind Rises, which Miyazaki believed would be his final film as a director, is a fictional biography of Jiro Horikoshi, the designer of the Zero plane. All three films are heart melting mixes of happiness and sadness, the emotional equivalent of mixing salts and sugars. Our own Vlad Savov remembers Princess Mononoke helping him deal with a stressful exam period.

Which is to say not that long. In a weekend Google Hangout sponsored by Paper Magazine, Franco tried to ""Break the Internet"" by having fans give him bizarre instructions for what to do. And judging by how surprised he was at how weird things got, it's safe to say Franco wasn't ready to stare the internet in the face. Some of my favorite requests: It's not long into the entire session that Franco starts calling people weirdos for the kind of requests they make. Now, to be completely fair, having a dog lick peanut butter off your face for the masses is pretty weird. But Franco's befuddlement is bizarre mostly because he himself has made a cottage industry out of doing weird shit (or art, though opinions vary) and getting people to react to it. Here, however, he seems vaguely turned off by the proceedings, bored with having to recite Tennessee Williams in a tutu, irritated by having to summon up a cannibalistic Tweetie Bird impression, and a little put out by twerking for the audience. Planted as he was in a hotel room with kittens and Christmas sweaters all at arm's length for this express purpose, he had to know something like this would happen. Who on the internet doesn't like cute animals? But the Web's actual citizens pulled him deeper into their world than he or his handlers probably anticipated, especially given how tame his video announcing the chat was.  The truth is, if Paper's aim was to break the internet with Kim Kardashian's butt and James Franco's peanut butter face, they really just succeeded at creating everyday internet but with celebrities. The internet is a supremely weird place. Any trip to BuzzFeed exposes that, and this whole project seems tailor-made for a generation of fans that enjoy a healthy diet of memes and image macros. But what we witnessed here was a PR campaign going down a Reddit rabbit hole very quickly, and Franco was a little unprepared.

Chances are, it's anywhere from a half an inch to an inch thick, replete with a handful of USB ports, a power plug, headphone jack, and maybe an SD card slot. I can all but guarantee that it's thicker than the laptop I'm currently using to write this article, Asus' Transformer Book T300 Chi. The $699 T300 Chi ($899 as tested) is a sliver of a computer, closer in size to the average tablet than a full-blown laptop. In fact, the T300 has a lot more in common with an iPad than an ultrabook. As with many Windows 8.1 machines, it's a convertible laptop, with a detachable keyboard and full touchscreen. But unlike many other convertibles, the T300's tablet portion is only 7.6mm thick and it doesn't have any full-size USB ports, HDMI ports, or SD card slots. Like Microsoft's Surface Pro 3, all of the T300's major components are crammed into the tablet area, including its 12.5-inch, 2560 x 1440 pixel IPS display, Core M processor, 8GB of RAM, and 128GB SSD. The Core M processor lets the T300 do away with the fans (just like Apple's upcoming new MacBook) and gives it that tablet-like profile. When attached to its Bluetooth keyboard, the T300 is still only 16.5mm thick, though the combined 3.14lbs of the two parts is more laptop-like than tablet-like.   In place of the standard ports you might expect to find on a laptop, the T300 has one Micro USB port, one Micro HDMI port, and a microSD slot hidden on its bottom edge. That means connecting any peripherals requires the use of adaptors, whether you just want to plug in a standard thumb drive, output video to an external display, or use a wired mouse. Those are the compromises that come with such a thin computer, and Apple's upcoming MacBook will require jumping through many of the same hoops. But there are other compromises with the T300 that make it tough to use as a daily machine. The Bluetooth keyboard (which is included and matches the main computer's attractive, but fingerprint prone sapphire blue finish) offers a large layout, but the keys are shallow and don't have backlighting. The deck below the keyboard is very short and isn't enough to support my hands for long periods of time. And the trackpad, while responsive to both single and multi-touch gestures, is very small and tedious to use. The two halves of the T300 connect with magnets, but unlike the Surface Pro 3, they don't talk to each other through the attachment point. The keyboard communicates with the main tablet part strictly via Bluetooth, which means there is often an annoying delay as the keyboard wakes up and pairs with the tablet when I open the computer and type in my password. Further, the T300 Chi has a slight wobble when it's on a flat surface and the screen is tilted all the way back (which isn't very far). Like so many other Windows 8.1 convertibles, the T300 is also rather awkward to use as a tablet. It's over one and a half pounds without the keyboard, and its large display combined with fat bezels make it much more clumsy to use than an iPad Air 2. The 12.5-inch, 16:9 screen works best in landscape mode, and while it has lots of resolution and wide viewing angles, there is uneven backlighting that's distracting and hard to ignore. Combined with the fact that Windows 8.1 is better suited for desktop environments than as a tablet interface, the T300 is best thought of as a laptop that can work as a tablet in a pinch, not the other way around.   The Core M processor in my review unit is clocked at 1.2GHz and combined with the 8GB of RAM on tap, has no trouble handling most basic computing tasks. It surely won't play any modern 3D games, but working in Chrome, Word, and other Windows 8.1 apps is no issue. I'm able to have as many tabs open in Chrome as I need without the system grinding to a halt, and switching between apps is quick and painless. I often forgot that I was using a computer that was more tablet than laptop, though the heat from the back of the T300 was enough to remind me that this is a full-blown Windows 8.1 machine and not a crippled charlatan faking the role. In addition to the heat, the speed and power in the T300 Chi come with less battery life than you'd expect from a tablet or even a modern ultrabook. The T300 lasted for 6 hours and 38 minutes in our rundown test, and in normal usage of browsing the web in Chrome, chatting with coworkers in Slack, and typing in Microsoft Word, the battery would kick the bucket in about five hours. That's a lot less than the iPad Air 2 musters, and it's far behind what you can get with the Surface Pro 3, which might be the T300's closest analogue in terms of performance and design (if not price). The T300 could be the ultimate road warrior's computer, but its average battery life make it hard to go all day away from an outlet.   Many have looked at Apple's upcoming MacBook as the future of laptop computers, even if it's too forward-thinking for where we are today. The T300 Chi is very similar to the MacBook in many respects: it's incredibly thin, solidly built, and attractive to look at. It also comes with many of the same compromises as the MacBook, namely a lack of port options. But the T300 does things differently than the MacBook will, and its attempt to be both a laptop and tablet at the same time don't do it any favors. I'd love to have a Windows ultrabook that's as thin and powerful as the T300, but doesn't pretend to be anything else. Give me a full laptop chassis in place of the detachable keyboard, longer battery life, and a slightly better display with the bezels of Dell's XPS 13 and I'd have a machine that I could easily use all day. The T300 is close, and as a taste of the future, it's pretty cool, but it's not quite there yet.",0.3531246382721937,0.6468753617278062,0.18174596031031673,1063,4.4534336782690502,490,5.6367346938775507,0,10,"Microsoft, Tech, Review",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Called ""mesh networking,"" the idea has been kicked around for years in hacker circles, but it got a major boost with iOS 7. Thanks to the new ""Multipeer Connectivity Framework,"" iPhones were able to connect to each other directly over Bluetooth or Wi-Fi, a minor software update with potentially major consequences. Firechat was one of the first apps to seize on the new feature, building a mesh-enabled chat app that drew a surprisingly large user base. The app recently reached 5 million users, popping up at music festivals and protests around the world. For protests, it was a way to communicate without routing through potentially hostile carriers, holding out even in the face of an internet blackout. For everyone else, it was just a fun way to jump off the grid. What if instead of connecting to the phone company, we connected directly to each other’s phones? But as the system has grown, it's run up against a serious range problem. The iPhone has a lot less Wi-Fi strength you'd get from a router, and can't reach nearly as far. Android phones are still stuck with Bluetooth for multipeer connections, which is even more limited. Firechat has found the most success in dense crowds — particularly music festivals — but most of the users end up reverting to standard networks as soon as the crowd breaks up. If mesh messaging is ever going to be more than a software flash mob, it's going to need a way to reach farther. But how? Now, we're getting a look at Firechat's answer. The company is developing a new hardware widget called Greenstone, designed to sit between phones, fill holes in the network, and go places that phones can't go. When Firechat founder Micha Benoliel first showed me the prototype, he was wearing one around his neck, an easy midpoint between the phone in his pocket and my phone, which I'd left on the other side of the table. The device also bridges over time, storing up to a thousand messages at once. If you need to send a message to a chat room that's out of range, the Greenstone will store it locally until it can be delivered. Designed to sit between phones and fill holes in the network That failsafe is important because the underlying network is so choppy. Greenstone is built entirely on Bluetooth, which has limited range and relies heavily on line of sight. If the device is in a crowd of moving people (like a concert), the device will be constantly hopping between connections, moving in and out of dead zones. You can wake the Greenstone up by shaking it (you’ll see a few lights go off), which will trigger a search for other Greenstones in the area. You'd never want to stream video over this kind of network, but for something asynchronous and relatively low-bandwidth like a chatroom, it could work just fine. This kind of impromptu network is such a new idea that there isn't really a word for what Greenstone is. (""Hub"" doesn't quite capture it, since the whole point of mesh is to avoid hubs.) It's also still a prototype, and a long way from being ready for prime time. Triggering the shake-to-activate feature is still a little tricky, and connecting is a lot harder than it should be — but those are exactly the kind of kinks that get ironed out as a product moves to market. You won’t be able to buy a Greenstone any time soon, but that doesn’t mean you won’t see one in the wild. Benoliel has been testing the devices out at events — most recently at SXSW — and he’s toying with the idea of blanketing college campuses with them as a way to promote the Firechat app. It will be a while before Greenstone is ready for store shelves, but in the meantime, it's an interesting prototype that makes the shaggy ideas of mesh networking seem an awful lot more viable.

Déjà vu (noun): a feeling that one has seen or heard something before I’ve spent the better part of the last two weeks with HTC’s new One M9. It’s the latest flagship from the once-powerful smartphone maker and the successor to last year’s One M8. The M9 is exceptionally similar to its forebear: it’s nearly all aluminum, has a 5-inch, 1080p screen, has really loud speakers above and below that screen, and is unmatched in build quality, craftsmanship, and design in the Android world. The M8 was a great smartphone — it was beautiful and fast and featured inoffensive software, great sound, and a sharp screen. The M9 has all of those traits, but it’s also been specifically designed to right the M8’s two major faults: a finish that was too slippery to hold and a camera that took sub-par pictures. Of those two things, the camera is far more important: the M8’s disappointing camera was the big factor holding it back from being great. For the past two weeks, I’ve been trying to shake the feeling that I’ve seen this all before, that I’ve acted out this scenario already. But I can’t. I’ve been living in smartphone déjà vu.   Déjà vu experiences can be great, frustrating, or even surreal. In the case of the M9, it’s a bit of everything. I’m going to start with the good, because really, there is a lot of good here. The One M9 has a beautiful design, beautiful finish, feels great in the hand, and doesn’t look like a copy of any other smartphone — except, well, the M8. But that’s not a bad thing, the M8 was a great looking phone and the M9 is too. The main visual differences between the two are the sharper edges of the M9 and the power button, which finally moved from the top of the M8 to the side of the M9. HTC says its goal was to blend the best of the M7 from two years ago with last year’s M8 and I’d say the company succeeded. The M9 you’re most likely to see dons a new two-tone color scheme: it’s silver on the front and back with gold on the sides. I’m not a huge fan of it, but the other color options (all gold, black, or even pink) look nicer. The finish is shinier than last year’s mostly matte surface, which works to make the phone less slippery than before. The relocated power button is also much easier to use on the M9, but it’s too easily confused with the volume buttons just above it. A simple fix would be to put the volume buttons on the opposite side as the power button, but overall this is a pretty minor complaint. On the whole, the experience of holding, using, touching, and taking the M9 in and out of pockets is the same as it was with the M8, save for the lack of worrying that the phone was going to slip out of my hands like a bar of soap at any given moment. The M9 is slightly shorter and ever so slightly thicker than last year’s phone, but it’s not noticeably different in everyday use. The same can be said for the M9’s 5-inch, 1080p display and front-facing speakers. The screen is color accurate and bright enough for outdoor use. It doesn’t have as many pixels as other smartphone displays, but it’s dense enough that it’s impossible to see any individual pixels or jagginess with the naked eye. Those signature front-facing stereo Boom Sound speakers still sound great too, and the M9’s are even a tad louder this time around.   The M9 is also really fast. It’s got Qualcomm’s new flagship Snapdragon 810 processor and 3GB of RAM, which means I almost never have to wait for an app to open or for the homescreen to redraw itself. This isn’t to say the M8 was slow — it wasn’t by any means — but the M9 bring a whole new level of speed. It’s easily the fastest Android phone I’ve used. That speed also comes with efficiency: the battery is slightly larger in the M9 than in the M8 and it consistently went all day on a single charge. It won’t last for more than a day off of the charger as larger phablets with their even bigger batteries can, but if you’re used to charging your phone every night anyways, it’ll easily get the job done. Part of that speedy experience also is thanks to the new version of Sense, the software that HTC layers on top of Android 5.0 Lollipop. It’s responsive and quick, and unlike other custom Android interfaces, doesn’t slow down the experience at all. It’s visually very similar to the software on the M8 and has most all of the same features. But there two new standout components: a new theming engine that lets you quickly customize the look and sound of the software, and a widget for the homescreen that attempts to predict which apps you’ll need based on your location. The theming ability is cool and fun to play with. You can quickly change the wallpaper, app icons, fonts, sounds, and more on your M9 with a variety of downloadable theme packs. Or you can create one on HTC’s website and upload it to your phone or share it publicly. You can even build a custom theme based on the colors in a picture you take. The theming does more than I expected it to and it smartly leverages Android’s customizability in fun ways. I’m less impressed with the predictive widget. It’s supposed to serve appropriate apps for work, home, or travel based on your location. Perhaps my email and calendar apps will float to the top when I’m at the office, while Maps and music are displayed when I hit the road. It’s a useful idea in theory (and it’s not particularly novel —there are a host of third party app launchers that promise the same things), but HTC’s execution needs work. It takes too long to learn my habits and it populates the widget with a folder of suggested apps, many of which were comically off base or already installed on the phone. (I have nothing against Canada, but I’ve been in New York the entire time I’ve used the M9 and it still insisted that I download the Canadian Post app.) Fortunately, it is just a widget, which means you can easily remove it from the home screen and forget about it.   But just as last year’s M8 had a lot going for it along with a few critical flaws, not everything is perfect with the M9. The biggest problem with the M8 was its lackluster camera, a low-resolution ""Ultra Pixel"" camera that just didn’t compare to the best cameras from Apple or Samsung. It was paired with a secondary sensor to do depth of field tricks that proved to be more gimmicky than useful. For the M9, HTC took a completely different approach: its main camera has a high-resolution, 20-megapixel sensor and that secondary sensor is gone. The UltraPixel camera has moved to the front, where it actually works pretty well for low-light selfies and its lower pixel count isn’t as much of a problem. The new main camera has lots of pixels though — a direct response to criticisms that the M8’s camera wasn’t high resolution enough. Unfortunately, this new approach doesn’t result in any better pictures, and in many cases, images taken with the M9 are worse than they were last year. The M9 has the pixel count the M8 lacked, but all too often the images are fraught with noise reduction and smearing of details. Low light pictures often have odd color casts and there’s unpleasant blooming in highlights. In well lit scenes, the M9 has trouble exposing wide ranges of light to dark areas. The actual camera software on the M9, the app that you use to take photos, is great. It’s fast and easy to use, and provides quick access to photographic controls such as white balance if you want them. But the end result just isn’t as good as it should be, certainly not for a flagship smartphone in 2015.   I tested the M9 against the iPhone 6 side-by-side in a variety of situations, and the M9’s images were softer, not as well exposed, filled with noise reduction artifacts that gave them a watercolor look, and often had inaccurate white balance. The iPhone 6 took better pictures in nearly every comparison. Apple (and to a certain extent, Samsung) has a huge advantage that HTC doesn’t: it controls its supply chain very tightly and can choose from the best camera components before anyone else. It's a disadvantage that HTC hasn't been able to overcome, and it's very obvious with the M9's camera. If there was one thing HTC had to get right with the M9, it was the camera. The design didn’t change, the screen isn’t new, the software is largely the same. The camera is where HTC focused all of its efforts and it came up short.   The original French adjective from which déjà vu is drawn from literally translates to ""already seen."" In the case of the One M9, much of it, from the good to the bad, has already been seen. On the good side, the M9 is a beautifully designed smartphone, with a great screen, great sound, speedy performance, and all-day battery life. It’s just like last year’s phone in those respects. But on the ugly side, the M9’s camera is a huge disappointment, not only because it doesn’t improve upon last year’s M8, but because it simply doesn’t work as well as many of the other phones you can choose from. The M9 doesn’t do anything to improve HTC’s position against the rest of ultra-competitive premium smartphone world. Samsung, HTC’s closest competitor, has dramatically closed the gap in terms of hardware and design with its forthcoming Galaxy S6. And by all accounts, it will have a far superior camera as well. The iPhone has long been a phone with great design and picture quality that beats most point and shoot cameras you can buy. Smartphones aren’t just phones anymore, they are increasingly the only cameras that people own or use. People often pick a phone based solely on how well it takes pictures and the phone’s camera can make or break the device. In the case of the M9 (and the M8 before it), it breaks it. For the third year in a row, HTC has produced one of the most visually alluring smartphones that feels as incredible as it looks. And for the third year in a row, it has show-stopping flaws, which bring the great experience you’re having to a screeching halt. Here’s one more definition: ""Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.""

The feature was first spotted yesterday by some Android Police readers, and screenshots posted to the site explain that ""on-body detection"" will disable the lock screen until you place your phone down on a table or some other surface. For instance, you'll need to unlock the phone the first time you try to use it after you pick up your phone and put it in your pocket in the morning. But so long as you keep the phone in your hand, pocket, or purse after using it, the device will remain unlocked and ready for its next use. Once you arrive at the office and place the phone on your desk, however, it will revert to its normal lock behavior. Sacrificing security for convenience   Of course, the feature won't be able to determine if you or someone else is carrying your phone — it merely uses the device's accelerometer to determine if it is being continually moved. So if you give your phone to a friend or are the victim of a pickpocket, the phone will most likely remain unlocked.

That's the message from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's (OECD) Health at a Glance 2013 report, which highlights the state of health in its 34 member countries. The report runs hundreds of pages long, detailing the most recent data in key areas of health and countries' health systems. One section looks into life expectancy gains over the past few decades, and, for many Americans, it makes for a worrying read. Chart has been modified to highlight US, no data has been changed, but some countries are omitted. According to the OECD's data, the United States is severely lagging in life expectancy gains, falling further behind the OECD average than in previous years. The overall movement over the past 41 years has obviously been positive — the average American life expectancy has increased by almost 8 years from 70.9 to 78.7 — but that increase is significantly slower than many other nations. The average increase over the period was 10.1 years, from 70 to 80.1 years, meaning the US has, in four decades, gone from a year ahead of the curve to more than a year behind. The average has been significantly affected by comparatively rapid health improvements in countries like Greece, Portugal, and Korea, but the US nonetheless lags behind. Another chart, pictured at the top of this article, shows a worrying statistic. The US spends the most on health, $8,508 per person, with few rewards. Most countries sit somewhere close to the curve; the next-highest spender is Norway at $5,699 per person, which has an average life expectancy of 81.4 years. Despite the sobering figures, the US on average feels healthier than any other OECD member: The OECD notes data is skewed in favor of English-speaking nations due to the nature of the question asked. The OECD suggests a few explanations for the lower gains. First, it highlights ""the highly fragmented nature of the US health system, with relatively few resources devoted to public health and primary care, and a large share of the population uninsured."" Second, it notes the US has a higher calorie consumption per capita and obesity rates, higher consumption of prescription and illegal drugs, higher deaths from road traffic accidents, and higher homicide rates than many nations.

""From what I understand, the guy just landed and had no clue where he was landing,"" McConnell spokesperson Stefan Bocchino told The Wichita Eagle. The 747 Dreamlifter often transports large parts (wings, etc.) for the 787 Dreamliner, which should offer some sense of scale for those unfamiliar with the aircraft. The situation presented a late night challenge for Boeing and FAA officials: to successfully take off again, the Dreamlifter would need to use a runway much shorter than is typically required for the huge plane. According to CNN, the Dreamlifter usually needs 9,199 feet of runway when it's filled with cargo. Instead, Jabara gives Boeing just 6,101 feet to work with.

Previous documents have described close collaboration between the NSA, GCHQ, and other national intelligence agencies, and several European countries have complained of spying on citizens or political leaders. But this leak confirms that under the Bush administration, the UK began allowing the US to collect and analyze ""unminimized"" data from its citizens, despite a long-standing policy against it. Before the 2007 decision, a 2004 change allowed the US to keep unminimized landline data. The US and UK are both part of what's known as Five Eyes, a treaty that also includes Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. Along with sharing intelligence information, members generally agree to avoid spying on each others' citizens — and doing so could allow countries to pass that information along to other members, getting around laws that stop them from performing their own surveillance. That means that if the US accidentally collected metadata about a British citizen before the change, it would have to scrub that from its database, just as it's supposed to minimize US citizen data by removing it. Under the new agreement, the NSA was still barred from intentionally targeting UK citizens without further authorization, but data collected while pursuing another case was fair game. Effectively, this ""incidental"" data is from citizens who aren't even under suspicion. Other documents suggest that the cloak and dagger business of spying on allies was very much at work within Five Eyes. A 2005 draft directive suggested that the US be allowed to unilaterally decide to spy on other member states; it's not known whether other countries considered similar policies.

Japanese volcanologist Hiroshi Ito told FNN News that the new island may yet be eroded away, but that it ""could also remain permanently.""

But in Foreign Policy, researcher Ralph Langner says that the virus was originally meant to do something much more devious. After researching both the Stuxnet code and how Iran managed its centrifuges, he believes that the routine we know today was a simpler and less sophisticated version of an earlier variant, which was meant not only to break the machines but to cover its tracks so well that nobody would notice. This first variant, says Langner, probably had the same basic purpose as the later one: to place ultimately catastrophic stress on the centrifuge rotors. Rather than infecting the controls and just raising pressure until the centrifuge broke, though, this program would make sure that nobody would realize anything was wrong. First, it would record 21 seconds of status records for the centrifuge regulation system. Then, it would play those values back over and over. While engineers watched the fake numbers, the first Stuxnet would slowly undermine the mechanisms that kept the rotors working — but carefully enough that they'd look like they were just wearing out early, not outright breaking. So why was the later version introduced? In his piece, Langner explains a complex series of fail-safes and workarounds that made the first Stuxnet an uncertain plan, as well as one that might have been detected just like the second version.",0.1710344635255588,0.8289655364744413,0.6103095131456332,263,5.1977186311787076,180,5.8111111111111109,0,0,US & World,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

Take a look below for nine of this week's best new trailers, including new series coming to Amazon and HBO.   I absolutely love the somber tone that's been going on in the past two trailers for Exodus, Ridley Scott's latest movie. The film is a biblical epic, and this final trailer makes it clear that Scott is setting it on an appropriately epic scale. It'll be in theaters December 12th.   Divergent isn't the best-received of the many YA sci-fi series that have been hitting theaters lately, but that hardly means that people aren't excited to see it. A first teaser for the series' second film was released this week, and, as someone who didn't see the first movie, I can tell you that I haven't the slightest clue what's going on. A house spontaneously bursts into flames and then flies away. And it looks like a good 80 percent or so of it was green screened. It'll be in theaters March 20th.   Amazon's next original series is coming out soon, and this week it released a first look. Bosch is based on a the detective novel series by Michael Connelly, focusing on an LAPD homicide detective. So far, it's hard to say much about how Bosch will turn out: it looks like a crime drama, and we're yet to see what'll make it special. It's coming out next year, though no specific date for it has been set just yet.   HBO has a new comedy coming this January from the Duplass Brothers. This first teaser for it doesn't reveal much, but it's one more show that you'll eventually have the option of binge watching on HBO Go. Check it out now so you'll know what's happening when it finally turns up.   I've seen a lot of people getting excited over Broad City's return for a second season, so here it is. Comedy Central premiered its trailer this week, and it retunes to TV on January 14th.   You know, it's a Johnny Depp movie. Mortdecai has Depp in a Pink Panther type of situation, playing a ridiculous detective trying to recover a stolen painting. It comes out on February 6th.      Benicio Del Toro plays drug lord Pablo Escobar in Paradise Lost, which is coming out January 16th. It looks like a suspenseful crime drama, following an outsider who comes into Escobar's crew after becoming involved with his niece.   Hungry Hearts looks intense. The trailer starts out showing a nice couple, but it quickly spirals into a deeply creepy situation about a woman who might be slowly killing her child. Also, Girls,' Adam Driver stars, which is pretty sweet. There's no release date for it yet.   Remember the gorgeous animated film The Secret of Kells that was up for an Oscar a few years ago? The director behind it is now back with Song of the Sea, another animated film that looks like it's turned out just as beautifully. The film stems from Irish folklore and involves a human who turns into a seal when in water. It'll be released in the US on December 19th.",0.6153610342114112,0.3846389657885888,0.1803649062159108,562,4.3736654804270465,319,5.369905956112853,0,0,"Culture, Entertainment",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

There's only so many hours in the day, so where do you focus your listening energies? That's where our Verge New Music Recommendations come in: it's our entirely subjective, non-comprehensive attempt to throw the favorite new songs and albums we've stumbled upon this week your way. Of course, we're barely skimming the surface here — feel free to throw any auditory discoveries you've made this week in the comments, and get busy listening. Winter is coming, and the new album from 2:54 will make a good soundtrack for it. Their music has a grand, sweeping, almost cinematic quality to it, and the echo-laden vocals of sisters Colette and Hannah Thurlow  make the whole record a haunting affair — the icy, sometimes menacing guitars combined with the mournful yet harmonious vocal performances make the whole thing feel a bit like a beautiful funeral procession.  But it's not all a dirge — the one-two combo of ""Tender Shoots"" and ""The Monaco"" are unexpectedly among the brightest things the group has done thus far.  — Nathan Ingraham   Songs from the soundtrack for The Hunger Games - Mockingjay Part 1 have been rolling out steadily over the last few weeks, with a host of new entries out this week. ""Kingdom"" couldn't be more different than Charli XCX's other recent soundtrack contribution, ""Boom Clap."" This song isn't mean to be a huge dance hit — it's surprisingly intimate and sounds quite different than just about every other song XCX has released in her short but prolific career thus far. The song also features contributions from Duran Duran's Simon Le Bon, a rather unexpected pairing. XCX told Pitchfork she wasn't exactly the biggest Duran Duran fan, but Lorde (who curated the Mockingjay soundtrack) said the song needed something from another time period. The result is one of XCX's more beautifully minimal songs and one of the more upbeat tracks we've heard from Mockingjay so far.  — N.I.    Yup, it's definitely Mockingjay week — this new Chvrches track is a standout on the Lorde-curated soundtrack from what we've heard so far. Like the group's other recent release ""Get Away,"" this song isn't a radical departure from what made their debut album so memorable, though it's pretty easy to catch some lyrics that could be applied to Katniss Everdeen's plight. However, even if you couldn't care less about The Hunger Games, this song is yet another excellent addition to Chvrches' ever-growing catalog. A new full album can't come soon enough.  — N.I.   The Decemberists are well known for their complex concept albums and long, winding, nautical-themed songs — but 2011's The King Is Dead saw the band take an abrupt turn into more concise, immediate, and more catchy territory. Now, with a new album coming next year, the band has released its first single, and it sounds like the Decemberists are heading back down a more moody but no less tuneful road. It's gloomier and denser than most of the songs on their last record, but it's still unmistakable The Decemberists — that might not win them any new fans, but those already on board should be excited to hear them back in fine form.  — N.I.   The new Foo Fighters release is just as much of an example of corporate synergy as it is an album — eight new songs, eight episodes of Sonic Highways on HBO, what could go wrong? Fortunately, the album can be easily enjoyed for its own merits — it doesn't break new ground for the band (and after 20 years, we'd be pretty surprised if Foo Fighters did something truly unexpected), but it's interesting to see them largely working with longer songs here. Five of the eight songs are over five minutes long — we're not talking monstrous Tool-esque epics here, but the song construction is just a bit less straightforward than most of the Foo Fighers' past work. Put aside the HBO show, the ""one song in one studio"" gimmick, and the plethora of guest musicians on the album, and it's still a damn good rock record in its own right.   — N.I.   We've arrived at the lastest of Lorde's direct contributions to the Mockingjay soundtrack. Just as she did on the soundtrack to Catching Fire, the New Zealand sensation has contributed a somewhat unexpected cover. This year, she went with ""Ladder Song"" by Bright Eyes, which is the penultimate track on the band’s 2011 album, The People’s Key. In her cover, Lorde ditches the spooky lo-fi piano sound that accompanied Conor Oberst’s voice in the original version and replaces it with haunting organ and some subtle sound effects. The beautifully somber track is rich with all sorts of melodrama, so it should fit nicely into a movie that promises to be full of the same. Note: this appears to be a leak, so it could disappear at any time — but the full soundtrack will be out next week. — Sean O'Kane.    As with most things Pink Floyd does, discussions will rage around this album — this time, they'll focus on how much of a ""Pink Floyd"" album this actually is. Those discussions are pretty much a moot point, in my mind — the band hasn't really existed for some 20 years, and it's been over 30 since Roger Waters left. Take The Endless River for what it is: a chance to hear the primary architects of the Pink Floyd sound get together and make music one more time. The late Rick Wright gets resurrected via old recordings that remind listeners how essential he was to creating Pink Floyd's signature soundscapes, while Gilmour and Mason each get a number of chances to shine, as well.  The only traditional song, ""Louder Than Words,"" is a bit overwrought and tries too hard for sentimentality, but the rest of the record has enough high points that bring you right back to what Pink Floyd did so well back in the '70s.   — N.I.   Putting aside the questions of whether The Inevitable End will really mark the dissolution of more than two decades of the Norwegian electro-pop duo Röyksopp, the group's new record is another worthy entry in a discography of surprisingly human electronic music. This one goes down a bit of a darker road, much like some of the songs near the end of the group's standout record Junior, and that tone makes it occasionally drag in some spots. Two ponderously long and uninteresting songs (""You Know I Have To Go"" and ""Compulsion"", both featuring Jamie Irrepressible on vocals) damn near derail the entire album, and the five bonus tracks are a tad unnecessary, but fortunately there are still plenty of beat-driven songs from the near future to bob your head to while speeding down a dark road. (Robyn doing vocals on two tracks certainly doesn't hurt, either.) ""Monument,"" ""Save You,"" and ""Rong' are easy choices for high points, and ""Thank You"" is a fitting end if Röyksopp really is going to call it a day.  — N.I.",0.6813991450304353,0.3186008549695647,0.1606593389249639,1221,4.6691236691236693,618,5.9190938511326863,0,0,"Culture, Entertainment",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Film connoisseurs should immediately appreciate the gravity of Langley's announcement. Each movie in the franchise has been exponentially more awesome than the one before it, culminating in 2013's blockbuster Fast & Furious 6, which raked in over three quarters of a billion dollars globally and featured a Dodge Charger exploding out of the front of the bad guy's cargo plane while attempting to take off.

According to BuzzFeed News, Apple is planning to debut a revamped Apple TV at its World Wide Developers Conference. The new box will reportedly support third-party apps, voice control with Siri, and presumably the internet-TV service that The Wall Street Journal described earlier this week. BuzzFeed says that the new device will likely include more storage and a version of Apple's latest mobile chip, the A8. Apple's more serious entrance into the living room has been long awaited. And, really, it's about time. The Apple TV has been a nice but overly simple box for most of its lifespan. The addition of an App Store, which BuzzFeed says will be included, would make it dramatically more capable and interesting, allowing apps and games to take over an entire TV. If Apple's long-rumored internet-TV service makes an appearance as well, the Apple TV would quickly become a major play for the living room. BuzzFeed reports that the Apple TV will include basic home automation features, too, however some are already built into the model that's shipping today. Apple recently reduced the price of that model to $69.

And recently, ABC's Good Morning America got a tour of the secret workout lab, where Apple fitted internal volunteers with sensors ""worth millions of dollars"" (and some scary looking masks) to amass a ton of data on exercise and physical activity. In many ways, it looks like your typical gym, with rowing machines, treadmills, and plenty of yoga mats. But from the beginning, Apple has been collecting all of this activity to help develop and improve Apple Watch. True to Apple's famous obsession with secrecy, the employees weren't told what project they were contributing to — though we have to imagine it wasn't difficult to guess it related to some sort of wearable.   ABC's tour was led by Jay Blahnik — one of Apple's earliest big fitness hires — who showed off ""climate chambers"" that help recreate workouts in extreme temperature conditions and varying humidities. Apple also visited locations across the globe (Alaska and Dubai are named) for proper outdoor testing. ""I think we've amassed already what may be one of the world's largest pieces of data on fitness, and our view is we're just beginning,"" said senior Apple executive Jeff Williams, who appeared at the company's Apple Watch event earlier this month. Apple's executives have repeatedly said that the device could have a profound impact on personal health. But it remains to be seen whether Apple Watch will outperform other fitness bands when it comes to tracking your heart rate and overall activity. Heart rate monitoring in particular is an area where wrist-worn products like the Microsoft Band, Fitbit Surge, and others have proven imperfect; devices strapped directly to the chest are typically far more reliable.

BBC News reports that, until now, Makemake had yet to undergo extensive observation. Led by Jose Luis Ortiz of the the Andalucian Institute of Astrophysics, the team observed that during the one-minute occultation, light emitting from the star quickly disappeared and reappeared. The discovery debunks previous belief that Makemake had a ""significant atmosphere,"" since planetary bodies with an atmosphere typically cause light behind it to fade in and out gradually. The scientists were also able to study the general size and shape of Makemake, revealing a mostly-spherical body about 930 miles across with a density similar to fellow-dwarf Pluto, but less than a third of that found with Earth.

The news paints a picture of postwar Afghanistan where American troops are an ongoing presence, even as foreign leaders push to reduce the presence of combat troops in the region. Another decade in America's longest war The 25-page long ""Security and Defense Cooperation Agreement Between the United States of America and the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan"" is dated July 25, 2013, and has not yet been signed — NBC News reports that the updated agreement will be debated this week in Kabul by 2,500 village elders, academics, and officials. The document states that US and Afghanistan will ""foster close cooperation"" in fighting al Qaeda, specifically in training the Afghan National Security Force (ANSF) and conducting combined military exercises. According to the document, the US will also ""have an obligation to seek funds on a yearly basis to support the training, equipping, advising and sustaining of the Afghan National Security Forces"" until the Afghan military is equipped to pay for its own defense. No specific amount is mentioned, however. All told, the draft states that the agreement would take effect on January 1st, 2015 and stay active until the end of 2024 and beyond, unless either or both nations call for an end to the agreement in writing with two years' notice. That means the 10,000 troops expected to remain in the embattled region will be stationed there for at least another decade. Afghan officials told NBC News that the agreement is critical for the country's future stability, as it ensures the government doesn't collapse and Afghanistan enters a civil war. We've reached out to the White House National Security Council for comment. Interestingly, the document makes no mention of drone combat or deployment, so it's still unclear what role unmanned aerial vehicles will play in the ongoing war.

He explained that the website does penetration testing on a weekly basis, runs malware scans every three minutes, and has a security operations team present 24/7, among other measures to prevent hackers. Chao said that he was unable to detail the one hacking attempt any further, as the information was classified. ""[Republicans] do not want the website to work."" Most of the reported security concerns Chao chalked up to training or technical issues that have since been resolved, reporting that no further vulnerabilities have been identified.

That directly contradicts the arguments made in support of the NSA's tracking program, which keeps logs of who you call, when, and for how long (though not of the actual content of the conversation).

The group will reportedly launch in January, and Adelson has already begun hiring lobbyists and experts in support.  Competing casinos are pushing for legalization Though online gambling was long believed to be illegal, a 2011 federal opinion stated otherwise, and states have since begun legalizing the business model on their own. Though Adelson, who runs Las Vegas Sands — owner of the Venetian and the Palazzo — is pushing for a ban, the Post reports that many of his competitors, including Caesars Entertainment and MGM Resorts, believe that regulated online gambling could help the industry and are in favor of its legalization. The Post reports that Adelson's opponents plan to strike back against his campaign, arguing that a ban on online gambling would only bring about unregulated black markets run from offshore. Even so, Adelson's offense could become a major obstacle for them: he was one of the biggest political donors during the 2012 election campaign, reportedly donating around $100 million in total. Though it's not clear how much he's planning to spend on the advocacy group, the Post reports that it'll be his biggest venture yet into legal debates around his own line of business. Adelson's lobbyists have reportedly already met with lawmakers and many congressional offices about the ban. According to the Post, draft legislation that would halt online gambling and direct the FBI to study potential law enforcement issues is now circulating among a small group. Adelson also reportedly plans to head out to Washington next year to meet with lawmakers and push the matter forward. But while draft legislation stopping online gambling may be circulating, efforts have existed on the other side of the issue to legalize the practice too.

As cities around the world consider the introduction of maglev trains, the Japanese government hopes the American group's experience of the journey — a test ahead of Japan's planned introduction of a new high-speed maglev train line between the cities of Tokyo, Nagoya, and Osaka — will encourage American companies to invest in the expensive technology for deployment in their own nation. The Americans on the train were on the advisory board of The Northeast Maglev, a company that is aiming to build a US line linking Washington DC to New York via maglev train. The New York Times reports the journey time between the cities would be reduced from three hours — via the US' current fastest train, Amtrak's Acela —  to one hour on the new maglev line. Motherboard reports that the journey time between Washington DC and Baltimore would be a scant 15 minutes. The journey between New York and Washington DC would be reduced from three hours to one Construction is due to begin on the Japanese maglev line next year. It will stretch from Tokyo in the east to Nagoya in the center of the country by 2027, and on to Osaka in the Kansai region by 2045. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has become a champion for the planned train line, saying ""it truly is a dream technology"" in a speech at the New York stock exchange in September. But as Abe talked maglev up abroad, back home in Japan he has faced criticism for the cost of the project as its budget spiraled to an estimated $112 billion. The cost is particularly prohibitive for an economy and population still in decline: the New York Times notes the number of Japanese citizens is set to decrease from 127 million to around 105 million by the time the line is extended to Osaka, meaning the maglev might not have the passengers to make its construction worthwhile. The Japanese government has offered to help pay for about 40 miles of the US route But if Abe's government can sell magnetic levitation to the US, it might well justify the expense. Abe showed his commitment to promoting maglev technology in a meeting with President Obama in which he offered to sweeten the deal for the Washington to New York train by putting several billion dollars of taxpayer money on the line. The New York Times reports Abe offered to provide the maglev guideway and propulsion system for the first 40 miles of the route, between Baltimore and Washington, free of charge. That investment would certainly bring the creation of an American maglev closer to fruition. A train between New York and Washington DC may well be quicker and easier than flying the route, but The Economist reports that the $50 million raised so far in private capital by The Northeast Maglev group ""would not even get the maglev out of downtown DC.""",0.6151247683260148,0.3848752316739852,0.8944916706362626,507,4.6982248520710055,250,5.7080000000000002,0,0,US & World,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

""We are looking at a world in which anyone with a little bit of cash can bring an undetectable gun that can fire multiple bullets anywhere — including planes, government buildings, sporting events and schools,"" Schumer says, reports the Associated Press. Though the 25-year-old Undetectable Firearms Act bars manufacturers from creating guns that can't be picked up by metal detectors, it's set to expire on December 9th.   ""Anyone with a little bit of cash can bring an undetectable gun."" According to New York Daily News, the act has been extended twice already and updated to reflect new technology, but Schumer anticipates that another extension will be challenged. Senators Patrick Leahy (D-VT) and Bill Nelson (D-FL) are joining Schumer in pushing for an extension. ""3D printers are a miraculous technology that have the potential to revolutionize manufacturing, but we need to make sure they are not being used to make deadly, undetectable weapons,"" Schumer said, reports the AP. Though the possibility of creating undetectable 3D printed guns is a real one, the guns haven't been able to hold up very well so far. Last week, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms posted videos of Defense Distributed's Liberator — the first successful 3D-printed gun design — in use, and shattering while being fired. Shattering has been a recurring issue for the Liberator, though some printings of it seem to have been capable of firing off more rounds before breaking than others.  Defense Distributed's founder, Cody Wilson, spoke out earlier today about what he says is a new PR campaign to help push forward the Undetectable Firearms Act's extension. In a blog post, Wilson notes that one proposed extension in the House wouldn't just require that metal be inserted in a 3D-printed gun, but would also ban individuals from producing rifle receivers and magazines on 3D printers as well. ""The goal of a new Undetectable Firearms Act is to make development and experimentation with these computer-aided devices fraught with danger and difficulty for the common man ... like any good police state should,"" Wilson writes.",0.5554594512302501,0.4445405487697499,0.8436412723139716,377,5.1724137931034484,244,5.8811475409836067,0,0,"Policy & Law, US & World",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

Last weekend, the Chinese city of Baoding revived the measure in a trial attempt to reduce traffic and decrease pollution. China Daily reports that use of Baoding's Second Ring Road on Friday between the hours of 7AM and 8PM was restricted to those of the city's 1.92 million cars with an even number at the end of their license plate. The following Saturday, the roads were only open to cars with an odd number at the end of their plate. Buses and public service vehicles such as ambulances were still allowed to use the roads regardless of their license plate number. Cars with even numbered plates could use the road on Friday; cars with odd numbered plates on Saturday Baoding's trial comes after reported governmental pressure on cities to reduce their pollution from dangerous levels. China Daily reports that the heavily polluted cities of Handan and Xingtai conducted similar tests in October, but that that neither city has yet released plans to continue with the license plate bans. Lanzhou has adopted the measure for a longer period: China's People Daily reports that the city — stricter than most Chinese cities about its air quality after ranking as the city with the country's worst air quality in a 2011 World Health Organization survey — will use odd-even license plate restrictions until January 10th next year. Baoding's air was reportedly half as polluted by 4pm on the day the trial began Elsewhere in the country, other measures have been introduced to curb car use and resultant pollution. Both Beijing and Shanghai use a complicated lottery process to earn a license plate. As Bloomberg Businessweek reports, these plates can often cost more than the car itself. Smaller cities, too, are adopting suites of anti-pollution measures aimed at road users. Guangzhou started using odd-even license plate road rationing after the Asian Games in the city brought increased traffic. China Daily reports some Chinese citizens argue the scale of license plate restrictions is too limited, and that the pollutants from coal burning will far outstrip any gains made in reducing road traffic. Road restrictions might be a more low-tech answer to curbing Chinese emissions than a Dutch designer's desire to 'vacuum' pollution away from the country, but they may actually provide a quicker, temporary fix to harmful levels of pollution: Baoding's air was reportedly cleaner by 4PM on Friday, dropping from a ""severe pollution"" air quality index to ""lightly polluted.""",0.34522875685202836,0.6547712431479716,0.8930608225854021,459,5.0610021786492378,244,5.9754098360655741,0,0,US & World,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

To some people, that might sound utterly ridiculous. Watching wrestlers try their hand at acting is bad enough. Dwayne Johnson and Dave Bautista have successfully made the rare leap from the ring to Hollywood stardom; most grapplers embarrass themselves trying. But writing superhero stories? That's an entirely different type of challenge. Thankfully, if you're familiar with the name CM Punk, you know he's more than qualified for the task of conjuring up a killer comic plot line. And that's exactly what he'll be doing for Marvel. Today the company announced that Punk (whose real name is Phil Brooks) is handling writing duties for February’s Thor Annual #1. He's been paired up with Rob Guillory, a friend and artist who's also new to Marvel, to produce ""a story about young Thor."" Punk seems to appreciate the fact that he's been given control over one of Marvel's ""heavy hitters,"" and he's dead set on making the most of this writing gig.  CM Punk making an appearance with World Wrestling Entertainment in 2011. (Ed Webster) ""I think we’re kind of under the radar, and there’s not really a whole lot of pressure on us to deliver some sort of a magnum opus as a 10-page backup story in an annual, so I think we have a lot of freedom that could be really fun,"" he told Marvel in an interview. Punk said he's leaning towards choosing the ""Marvel Model"" for his first time out, where the writer and artist collaborate on a story, but specific dialog isn't added until after the comic's been illustrated. As for what's to come in the story, Punk gave an outline of sorts: So the idea was, let’s do a story about young Thor as kind of a brash, bratty teenager who’s like, ""I’m totally worthy of this hammer. My dad’s full of [expletive]. I don’t know why I’m not ‘worthy’ of the hammer. Look at all this cool stuff I did."" And it’s more or less like a drinking story. He’s gonna be sitting around with a few choice characters from the Marvel Universe, and they’re all gonna be drinking, and Thor’s gonna basically be complaining about essentially why his dad won’t give him the keys to the car. It's been about 10 months since Punk, one of the more gifted performers to rise up through WWE's ranks in the last decade, abruptly walked out on the company. He held Vince McMahon's top title for more than a year, but that's nothing compared to CM Punk's lifelong affinity for comic books. The tattoo of a G.I. Joe Cobra sigil on his right shoulder is just one clue pointing to Punk's passion. When he was still entertaining wrestling fans, Punk would shout ""it's clobberin' time"" as he approached the ring — borrowing The Thing's pre-brawl catchphrase, and he'd often tweet about the trade paperbacks that served as reading material between his WWE appearances. (""I travel so much that single issue comic books never really held up,"" he explained in the Marvel interview.)  The cover art for Thor Annual #1. But now, outside of intermittent appearances for Chris Hardwick's Nerdist and one-off gigs, Punk has largely disappeared from the public eye — a change of pace he seems to be enjoying. Thankfully for fans eager to reconnect, he's got bigger ambitions for the future: Punk said his dream is to write a story for The Punisher that's been kicking around in his head for years. ""So until they let me do that, you’re gonna get all kinds of other stories about all kinds of other characters until they satisfy this need I have to write Frank Castle.""",0.4181575764482943,0.5818424235517057,0.17003496363047818,617,4.7390599675850895,382,5.7015706806282722,0,4,"Culture, Entertainment",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

They're not just using any old tablets, though: they're using Samsung tablets. We know this because Samsung published an ""exclusive"" version of the Avengers: Age of Ultron trailer this morning, but most of what's exclusive about it is a couple quick shots of product placement. We see Black Widow checking out a photo on one Galaxy tablet or another, and later, we see people running for cover outside of a Samsung store amid a huge fight. Oddly, the Samsung store actually looks like it might be empty.  There are obvious opportunities for integration with 'Guardians of the Galaxy' Samsung advertises basically everywhere, so we really shouldn't be surprised to see that it's even advertising inside of our fantasy worlds. This product placement and recut trailer comes as part of what appears to be a broad partnership between Marvel and Samsung that was announced over the summer, with the two companies agreeing to integrate their products.

But even if Samsung advertising everywhere is strangely realistic, it's still something that might remove you for a moment from a huge film like this.

But there's no doubt that it's a fascinating move from the Japanese giant, representing a more aggressive assault on the cable-box monopoly than many others have been able to muster. PlayStation Vue will deliver live and catch-up TV programming together with on-demand content through a PlayStation 3 or 4 console (or iPad, later); present partners include CBS, Discovery, Fox, NBCUniversal, Viacom, and Scripps, with Sony saying more will come in the future. There are some notable omissions, of course, like ABC, ESPN, and Disney, meaning fans who keep their cable box around for live sports coverage probably won't find much new here. But if you watch a lot of Comedy Central or MTV, or generally engage in a ton of aimless channel surfing, PlayStation Vue may be worth a look.

After Swift removed her entire catalog from the streaming service last week, Spotify boss Daniel Ek said that she, along with other mainstream artists, was on track to earn over $6 million in royalties this year. But Scott Borchetta, CEO of Swift's label Big Machine, has countered that claim, saying that the ""Shake It Off"" singer had earned less than $500,000 from Spotify streams in the US in the last 12 months. A Spotify spokesperson told Time that Swift had been paid a total of $2 million over the last 12 months for the global streaming of her songs, but Borchetta still maintains that Spotify is a blight on the music industry. ""The facts show that the music industry was much better off before Spotify hit these shores,"" he said, clarifying the amount Spotify paid out over the last year as ""the equivalent of less than 50,000 albums sold."" According to Borchetta, Swift earns more from her videos on Vevo than she did from having her music on Spotify. Spotify paid Swift ""the equivalent of less than 50,000 albums sold"" Of course, half a million dollars in a vacuum is an impressive figure, but Swift is phenomenally successful in terms of sales, and one of a few remaining mega pop stars. Her most recent album, 1989, became the first this year to sell more than a million copies in a week — a feat only equaled by 18 albums in history. Unlike most, Taylor Swift can make millions off the back of traditional album sales, but by keeping her music away from Spotify even as it begs for her to come back, she and Borchetta say they're trying to make the larger point that the service doesn't pay its artists a reasonable fee.

It certainly sounds like pirates will be able to upgrade to Windows 10 at no cost — the alternative, that they could pay to upgrade to a copy of Windows that still isn't considered genuine, would be strange — but it's quite possible that Microsoft will include some restrictions on unofficial copies that have yet to be mentioned. It could be a limited offer, include a trial period, or have some other promotion around acquiring a genuine license. Presently, people running pirated copies of Windows are not presented with major restrictions. They still receive critical security updates and are only blocked from receiving what Microsoft calls ""optional updates or benefits"" — it lists its free security suite as an example.

According to The Wall Street Journal, HBO, Showtime, and Sony have all been speaking with internet providers, including Comcast, about the possibility of being treated as ""specialized services,"" separating them out from other internet traffic and essentially giving them a fast lane to consumers. Though fast lanes are explicitly prohibited under the FCC's new net neutrality rules, these fast lanes actually fall in a strange gray area that's yet to be explored. It's a fast lane, but it may not qualify as one The FCC carves out an exception for special services that don't provide wide access to the internet, such as VoIP and heart monitors. Those services are therefore exempt from net neutrality rules and may be provided over a fast lane. If that sounds confusing, it is — and the FCC basically admits it. It notes that these services ""could be provided in a manner that undermines the purpose of the Open Internet rules."" If that's the case, they ""will not be permitted."" Exactly what counts as a specialized service isn't laid out in the FCC's net neutrality rules. Rather, the commission gives a very broad definition and says that it has the discretion to stop such services if they become problematic. The question, then, is whether HBO, Showtime, and other web TV providers can create a setup that makes them look like they happen to use data but are not actually offering access to the internet. The fact that HBO is specifically trying to offer HBO Now through internet providers — and not on its own — speaks to this. As a service that's bundled with internet access, an internet provider may be able to treat HBO Now like a specialized service, and therefore send it over a fast lane. ""There is nothing that prevents you from doing that in terms of net neutrality,"" Dan Rayburn, an analyst at Frost & Sullivan who specializes in streaming media, tells The Verge. ""Are you prioritizing packets within the last mile? It depends on how you define that and how you set it up from a technical standpoint."" Internet providers might be able to explain this by bundling internet TV channels Comcast has already been doing something similar to this for a few years now with its own on-demand service. On the Xbox, accessing Comcast's on-demand service over a Comcast internet connection won't count against subscribers' data caps. It was a controversial practice when Comcast first announced it, and concerns will only escalate if it becomes common to loop in other, paying networks. In that instance, Comcast argues that it's merely an extension of its TV service, which viewers must also be subscribed to. The story would be different, however, in the case of an online-only subscription. This possibility certainly presents some major net neutrality concerns. Smaller video streaming services would be at a major disadvantage if their videos weren't coming through as reliably as videos from major networks. Other services that support net neutrality, like Netflix, could eventually find themselves in a place where they needs to pay for special treatment in order to compete — assuming that these are paid deals. This is, in sum, exactly why the FCC passed net neutrality rules. Of course, there's still a lot we don't know about the structure of how such a deal would work. The Journal also reports that ""most broadband providers"" are pushing back against this proposed arrangement because it would be too costly. Comcast is also reported to have told Sony and HBO that it wouldn't agree to an arrangement like this unless it could offer this arrangement to all video providers so that it doesn't run into regulatory issues. ""It makes a mockery of net neutrality."" One major internet TV provider is already calling this out as a bad idea. Roger Lynch, the CEO of Dish-owned Sling TV, tells the Journal that ""it makes a mockery of net neutrality."" Big companies like Dish could afford to pay, he says, but ""it’s a bad thing for consumers and a bad thing for innovation."" The good news for net neutrality advocates is that the FCC gave itself all the room necessary to address this if it doesn't like it. Its description of specialized services is intentionally vague, and it's seemingly intended more for critical or novel infrastructure than TV, such as ""services that provide schools with curriculum-approved applications and content."" That's not to say that TV couldn't pass as an exception, but the FCC could overrule that if it chose to. ""The commission expressly reserves the authority to take action if a service is, in fact, providing the functional equivalent of broadband Internet access service or is being used to evade the open Internet rules,"" it writes. ""The commission will vigilantly watch for such abuse.""",0.40410334222772115,0.5958966577722788,0.1984714343492053,824,4.9623786407766994,424,6.0801886792452828,1,0,Tech,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
