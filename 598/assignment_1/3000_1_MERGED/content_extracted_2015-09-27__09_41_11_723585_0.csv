Nestled amongst the beaches and boardwalks of Newport Beach, you’ll find Calty Design Research. First opened in 1973 as the first West Coast facility of its kind from a major automotive manufacturer, it represents one-fifth of the Toyota Design Network. Here, cars like the 1978 Celica sports coupe, 2012's stylish Lexus LF-LC concept, and the very first Prius were designed. The facility's responsibilities range from minor cosmetic changes for minivans to dreaming up the cars of the future. But with the Toyota FT-1 sports concept, unveiled today at the 2014 North American International Auto Show in Detroit, they did something a bit different — design a car with a little help from a video game. The ""Vision Gran Turismo"" project has developer Polyphony Digital partnering with some of the world's biggest auto manufacturers to bring beautiful concept cars to the world of GT. These cars are handpicked to represent the game's racing spirit, and they’ll also be released as free downloadable content so Gran Turismo 6 players can give them a spin in-game. Though the FT-1 wasn’t initially designed with the game in mind, its distinct style and feel made it a perfect fit for the project as a follow-up to Mercedes-Benz's stunning AMG supercar. And the creative team at Calty had a very specific idea for the kind of vehicle they wanted to make. ""It's a design study for a sports car,"" says studio chief designer Alex Shen. The FT-1 is meant to look like it was sculpted by the air — a technique known as function sculpting — which explains its wonderfully exaggerated front end, complete with deep vents and uncovered LED headlamps. But it's more than just an artistic consideration — the sculpted body is also meant to be both simple and functional. ""There's nothing frivolous,"" says Shen. Everything serves a purpose: the deep vents in front of the tires suck in air, for instance, which is then pushed out through additional vents behind the wheels. Even the sloped roof is designed for maximum airflow, exactly what you want for a car purely meant for speed. According to Shen, form and function go hand-in-hand on a project like this. ""If you make it look beautiful,"" he says, ""it usually turns out pretty well."" Though their job involves shaping headlamps and designing windshields, the team at Calty considers what they do to be a form of art. ""Everything we do here is an artistic endeavor,"" says Calty's president, Kevin Hunter. And the key to that art is clay. Lots and lots of clay. Once the research phase of a project is completed, which involves studying everything from architecture to fashion, artists draw up concept sketches. The next step is to build a model of the car with a type of thermal clay that is soft as putty when heated. Sculptors take tiny premade, generic car bodies and slather them with clay, which is then molded and twisted to recreate the concept sketch in three dimensions. It's a particular skill, one that takes three to five years of training to master. Calty's sculptors even build their own tools, creating a tool chest that looks like something out of a Saw movie, complete with a variety of blades, pokers, and circular razors. ""You never have enough tools,"" says modeler Aaron Huncovsky. Like most automotive design studios, a large percentage of Calty's staff come from a fine arts background, which might be why clay is so important to the studio. It gives creators a chance to get their hands dirty — literally — instead of constantly being confined to a computer screen and rendering software. When the small models are complete, the design goes through many more iterative stages, as it’s constantly refined. First the data is fed into a computer-aided design program, or CAD, which lets designers run the numbers to check things like wind resistance and tweak accordingly. The studio also has what it calls a VR room, essentially a mini theater where they can check out full-size 3D models of cars on massive screens (it also doubles as a lunchtime yoga studio). Eventually larger clay models are created to better suss out the details, culminating in a full-scale version of the design made of clay. It's a back-and-forth process, but for the FT-1, Calty had a secret weapon — Polyphony Digital. The studio behind the Gran Turismo series was involved in the project early on, with Polyphony CEO Kazunori Yamauchi travelling to California to check out progress. The game design studio eventually pulled data from the 3D models to build in-game versions of the sleek concept car. For the first time, Calty designers were able to actually see one of their models in motion before it went into production. ""Gran Turismo is somewhat of a simulator, so it allows us to see the car in its environment,"" says Shen. ""That was one thing that was missing, because these are static models, and this is a dynamic car."" The initial game model was actually built in Gran Turismo 5, since GT6 wasn't yet completed while the car was being designed. It was an especially useful tool when it came to selling the concept to Toyota headquarters in Japan — instead of a standard model, Calty had a playable demo perfect for conveying the emotional impact they hoped the FT-1 would create. Luckily for them, Toyota president and CEO Akio Toyoda, an accomplished race car driver himself, is a bit of a GT fan. ""Akio actually drove the car when we presented it to him,"" explains Hunter. The concept was soon approved (though Toyota has provided no hints as to whether the FT-1 could eventually be commercialized). ""This is a car about emotion. Something that you feel right away."" Polyphony also helped provide some outside feedback, a rarity for Calty's projects. ""Typically we don't bring people in that early in the process,"" says Shen. ""It was cool because we had a different perspective. Normally we're working among ourselves, but to see how they felt about the car was cool."" Today's unveiling represents around 18-20 months worth of work and numerous revisions — about 85 percent of the car was changed or tweaked since the the first Gran Turismo 5 model was built. The result is an aggressive-looking concept that's easy to understand at a single glance — and that's kind of the point. ""We make a lot of intellectual cars, cars that you have to think about,"" says Shen. ""This is a car about emotion. Something that you feel right away.""",0.6421241416881542,0.35787585831184576,0.3641159169774535,1121,4.8670829616413913,584,6.1489726027397262,0,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

The multi-year agreement will have 3D Systems working with Hershey to come up with new ways of delivering 3D-printed food to consumers. Hershey is the first big food company to jump on the 3D-printed confection bandwagon, and 3D Systems gains a lot from it. The company will get its products like the ChefJet into the hands of the largest producer of chocolate in North America, which can easily shell out the money to pay for the machines and invest in developing and testing different kinds of 3D-printed food. As far as Hershey goes, the spoils will come over time. If the partnership produces something desirable to consumers, Hershey could gain name recognition as the first 3D-printing confectioner giant.  Could 3D-printed Hershey Kisses be just as good as regular ones? We've seen other kinds of 3D-printed chocolate in the past. MIT Media Lab's David Carr created the peculiar ""Eat Your Face Machine"" back in 2011, which uses a computer to take a model of a person's face and then carves that face in a block of chocolate. Instead of becoming a universal hit, it ended up teaching Carr more about the social implications of eating a 3D model of a person's face — as it turns out, people weren't too thrilled about it, even if it was made out of chocolate.  But since the technology is there to make a 3D-printed chocolate face, there's no reason why we can't have 3D-printed Hershey Kisses. We saw some 3D-printed candies at CES 2014 made from 3D Systems' ChefJet that looked much more like traditional confections, and they actually tasted good, too. However, those candies are very fragile — the ones made of chocolate hold up slightly better than the ones made of sugar, which crumble to sweet dust in your mouth immediately — and only people in California can order bags of them from Cubify. Currently, 3D-printed candy is localized to where companies like 3D Systems are, and with the ChefJet models priced between $5,000 and $10,000, consumers are not going to run out and buy one any time soon. If 3D Systems and Hershey can develop a way to make stronger, more portable 3D-printed chocolates, it'll be one more step toward making 3D-printed food more accessible, and acceptable, to everyone.",0.5471380004618118,0.4528619995381882,0.4412508701218103,413,4.8571428571428568,239,5.5815899581589958,0,0,"Business, Design, Tech",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

That may sound like hyperbole, but that was my first impression when experiencing the DJI Inspire One. This is a unit that anyone could pick up and learn to fly quickly, just as you could with our top ranking drone, the DJI Phantom. But it offers a ton of powerful new features that were previously only available in units too big, dangerous, and expensive for the average consumer to own. Watching the Inspire One take off and land is exciting, because it transforms mid-flight, with the legs folding up after takeoff so you can shoot 360 degrees of unobstructed video. The unit also has a ground-facing camera that can track what's below and keep the unit stabilized, even when there is no GPS signal, making it much easier to fly indoors. The built-in camera on the Inspire One can shoot 4K video and 12 megapixel photographs. Like the high end S1000, the Inspire One also offers dual operator controls, meaning you can have a pilot and a cameraman working in tandem. It also integrates DJI's Lightbridge system, which retailed alone for about $1,400, allowing you to see and store a 1080p video in real time at a distance of up to just over one mile. According to DJI the unit can fly for 16-18 minutes on a single charge. Ease of use is still paramount here. Out of the box the only assembly required is to spin on the self-tightening rotors. The Inspire features a one touch takeoff from its iPad app and can land itself at a home position you set. It can also track a dynamic home position, meaning you can set your remote control as the home, and it will return to you, even if you wander off from where you launched. The downward-facing camera also alerts the unit when it's close to the ground, and it will lower its landing gear accordingly. The Inspire One app allows you to draw a route and see how closely your unit is following that path. DJI has brought autonomous way point navigation to the Phantom, but the Inspire One won't launch with that. DJI spokesman Michael Perry told me that the company was waiting to implement that feature, along with a ""follow me"" feature that would allow the drone to autonomously track a user, until they had perfected it. DJI settled on a retail price of $2,800. That fits in between the roughly $1,000 Phantom and $7,000 S-1000. It's a big chunk of change for a holiday gift, although if the Phantom is any indication, that price will come down quickly. For the true newbie, the Inspire might be more power than they need, especially when you can get a great drone for $500, but for anyone who is looking to step up their drone game without breaking the bank, the Inspire One is a pretty revelatory piece of machinery.

The service, which launches next week in invite-only beta, is to be called YouTube Music Key. ""Artists and fans have made YouTube the biggest music service in the world,"" says Christophe Muller, YouTube’s director of global music partnerships. ""We want to continue to make YouTube the best place for artists and fans to connect."" The service is meant to capitalize on YouTube’s status as the largest online streaming service in the world by offering new tools for both free and paid users. Starting today, the Google-owned site begin highlighting a variety of new options for users who want to listen to music. The centerpiece is a new top-level tab for music on Android, iOS, and the web. The tab makes personalized recommendations about music videos, playlists, and music that’s trending on YouTube. The site will also surface full-length albums in a way it hasn’t before, with artists’ full discographies listed on their profile pages along with music videos and related content.     You can get all of that for free if you’re willing to listen to some ads. The more intriguing part of YouTube’s announcement is Music Key, which will have ad-free listening and some other perks when it begins rolling out Monday. For now, the program is invite-only, and beta testers will get six months of free access followed by an invitation to sign up for a promotional price of $7.99 a month. Music Key also includes a subscription to what the company is now calling ""Google Play Music,"" its Spotify competitor, which normally sells for $9.99 a month. (The terrible ""Google Play Music All Access"" name is dead, and the newly integrated service will let you play ""many"" music videos from inside Google Play Music.) The terrible ""Google Play Music All Access"" name is dead To start, Music Key will be available in the United States and six European countries. YouTube executives were vague about whom it will invite to try Music Key but said that heavy music listeners will be among those targeted. Eventually — YouTube won’t say when — anyone will be able to sign up directly, with the revenue shared among YouTube, record labels, and the artists. There will be a back door into the service: anyone who wants to try Music Key can sign up for Google Play Music and get access to the beta immediately. The YouTube apps for Android and iOS will be updated on Monday to include the new features. If that all sounds confusing, there’s a reason that Music Key’s launch has been delayed several times. In its first major effort to build a new product around content already hosted on YouTube, the company has struggled with how to create an experience that feels valuable enough to pay for without disrupting YouTube’s core service too much. In February, Susan Wojcicki, Google’s former head of ads and commerce, took over YouTube; she took a close interest in Music Key, and a planned spring launch was put off. Several top executives then left the company, including Shiva Rajaraman, its head of product management, who defected to Spotify.   The result of Google's efforts is a hybrid that looks likely to increase music listening on YouTube, at a time when YouTube is one of a tiny few companies believed to be profiting from streaming audio. (Google doesn’t break out YouTube’s financial performance in its quarterly results.) And watching ad-free music videos will be a nice perk for anyone who prefers Google’s streaming service to Spotify, Rdio, or their many rivals. You'll still see ads on YouTube At first glance, little here seems likely to pry anyone away from their current paid streaming service of choice. Even if you decide to pay for Music Key when your free trial expires, you’ll still see ads all over YouTube — the only ad-free videos will be the ones licensed from record labels. If you have dreamed of storing ad-free 720p music videos on your mobile device, Music Key could be the answer to your prayers. For anyone else, the value looks less clear. But this is only the first step. YouTube believes it can benefit simply from boosting the overall amount of listening on its platform — it has paid out more than $1 billion to artists and labels based on ad revenues to date, and the more ads it serves, the more it profits. And so building new ad-supported tools to help people listen to more music on YouTube is a logical step. The question of how many people will pay to do their listening on YouTube seems murkier.

Spotify replied in the same Time article, saying it had paid Swift $2 million in global streaming royalties over the last 12 months. $6 million, $500,000, $2 million — how do you reconcile all those numbers? It's pretty simple actually. All these numbers could be accurate without conflict. Borchetta was looking to cherry-pick the smallest possible figure, so he went with $500,000, which is what Spotify paid for Taylor Swift streams in the US. But that's only one of its markets, and it's not even its largest. Globally, Spotify paid swift $2 million over the last year. How did Ek get to a whopping $6 million? As more people sign up for Spotify and Taylor Swift continues her march towards infinite popularity, the amount she is getting paid is increasing. He took her trend line and ran it forward a year to get to the highest possible number he could quote.""We paid Taylor’s label and publisher roughly half a million dollars in the month before she took her catalog down—without even having 1989 on our service—and that was only going to go up,"" Spotify told Time. There is a much bigger argument going on here about whether or not streaming services are cannibalizing album sales and digital downloads. Will artists be left with pennies on the dollar they once earned? For the rare artist left like Taylor Swift who can move actual honest-to-god compact discs, there may be a boost in sales from keeping new tracks off Spotify. But album sales have been in a downward spiral since well before streaming services arrived, and streaming royalties are the fastest growing source of revenue in the music industry. There are few people who can swim against that current, and it can only last for so long.",0.5392240837750226,0.4607759162249774,0.8595150237662547,386,4.8160621761658033,232,5.4655172413793105,0,0,"Business, Tech",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

But the organization actually represents many of the biggest Fortune 500 companies in the US, and according to a report from Bloomberg, it has been petitioning the FCC on the topic of ""Protecting and Promoting the Open Internet."" In an ex-parte notice filed with the FCC, Ad Hoc joined President Obama in calling for the use of Title II, arguing that the current system for providing residential internet service is a ""terminating access monopoly"" without meaningful competition. Terminating access monopolies Lawyers from Ford, Visa, UPS, and Bank of America all attended the Ad Hoc meeting with the FCC, although none of those companies would openly discuss support of Title II. In fact Ford, when asked by Bloomberg, outright denied that it was advocating for Title II. The documents submitted by Ad Hoc, however, are clear. And in fact Ad Hoc has long been advocating an end to the lack of competition in the residential ISP market, filing alongside the FCC as far back as 2009.   Turning private pipes back into public utilities There doesn't have to be a conflict with Ad Hoc pushing for Title II while its members deny that they are. That's the whole point of trade groups like this, to provide cover for corporations that don't want to push a certain agenda themselves. These companies have to do business with the major ISPs every day, and the reform they are asking for from the FCC is actually more aggressive than what President Obama called for. While Obama called for internet service to be classified as a utility, he stopped short of calling for an end to the last-mile monopolies most ISPs enjoy. Ad Hoc's position is closer to what happened in the UK, where the backbone infrastructure was made a heavily regulated utility and everyone was allowed to compete by offering internet service over those wires. It's highly doubtful we'll actually see that happen in the US, but there is a decent case for it. Verizon, for example, argued in its own filings that the fiber it was laying to offer high speed internet was in fact a Title II common carrier, at least when doing so earned it tax payer subsidies and construction rights. When it was facing the FCC in court, Verizon saw things a bit differently.

Sites you may have heard of, such as The Verge, continue to build real businesses on the web, and without the help of a dedicated mobile app. Still, study after study finds that we increasingly spend our time inside apps, not the mobile web, and that raises some disturbing questions about what kind of world we're experiencing. Because while the web is a portal to anything and everything, apps are quite often self-contained capsules, with little to link them to other experiences or information. Wildcard, a New York City startup founded by Jordan Cooper, is hoping to change that. It's launching an app, ironically, that hopes to be the world's best mobile browser and search engine, combining the depth of the open web with the ease of native app interfaces. It does that by turning web pages into cards and translating HTML into clean ""cards"" we can easily swipe and tap. ""Suddenly you're on a web page full of tiny text and images."" ""Nobody wants to click a link from an email and end up on the mobile web,"" says Cooper. ""Suddenly you're on a web page full of tiny text and images, you have to pinch to zoom in, scroll around, and literally click on tiny blue links. It's miserable."" Shopping is another pain point. ""Filling in your billing information, your size, your address, is all way too tough on most mobile sites."" When you open up the WildCard app it shows you a list of trending topics. ""Comet landing"" was trending this morning when I opened it up. Clicking on that took me to a list of cards from CNN, NPR, and other news outlets. Each had a clean headline, a bit of text describing the article, and a photo. Clicking through brought me to a clean, easy-to-scroll version of the full text. The app also serves up a news digest for things like tech, sports or politics, and sections aimed at searches like flu season or good home brew coffee. In the flu and coffee sections some of the cards offer up an item for purchase. Like Spring, the card interface here makes it very easy to check out images, choose your size and color, and buy when you're ready. You enter your information into WildCard once, and it will handle payments to any merchant. ""Some searches we do great on, some we don't."" Unfortunately, when I tried to simply search the open web, instead of the prepackaged selections Wildcard was serving me, things kind of fell apart. The results were very limited, out-of-date, and sometimes just way off topic. ""Search needs people using it in order for the results to get more relevant, kind of like Siri in the early days,"" says Cooper. ""Some searches we do great on, some we don't, but five months from now, the search experience will be much much more robust. We're just choosing to improve in public.  This definitely isn't a 'we did it'moment for us so much as a 'here's the beginning' moment."" When it worked, for example searching through a collection of Ikea furniture, the Wildcard experience was far easier and more intuitive than what I found going through a Google or Siri search from my phone. If the company can get enough momentum to really translate a big chunk of the web into cards, I can see it being my go-to browser for certain searches. For now, it's a great idea that still needs a lot of work.",0.5262069418462618,0.4737930581537382,0.1542555868336266,619,4.5783521809369949,355,5.5323943661971828,0,0,"Business, Tech, Report",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

The bigger picture is figuring out whether the thing you're building is a unique and defensible business or just a cool feature these companies haven't bothered to focus on yet. This hypothetical challenge has just become a reality for Wattpad, a Toronto startup that has built a community of writers and readers creating millions of new stories each month. Amazon jumped into the game last month with the debut of WriteOn, a service offering the same mix of author tools and a readership composed of the huge audience already using Amazon for ebooks. What Wattpad has going for it are two things: focus and community. Unlike Amazon, Wattpad is squarely focused on solving a single problem, not stretching itself across everything from drones to phones. It also has 75 million stories and 35 million users already churning out work on its platform, while Amazon's WriteOn is still in private, invite-only beta. ""Everyone has a story to tell.

In spite of selling its device business to Microsoft earlier this year and swearing off putting its name on smartphones until 2016, Nokia wishes to be seen as the same driver of mobile innovation that it’s always been. Finland’s most beloved company will continue ""bringing the magic of technology"" to the masses, and the N1 is just ""the first of many"" new devices coming that will feature the iconic Nokia branding. Instead of entering retirement as a stable but boring networking company the way that Ericsson did, Nokia has decided to keep competing in the cutthroat world of mobile devices. But it’s doing it on its own, rather unique, terms. Let’s start with what Nokia isn’t. Nokia is no longer a manufacturer of consumer devices. The N1 is the product of a licensing agreement with Foxconn that will see the Taiwanese company produce and distribute the tablet while paying royalties to Nokia for its design and brand. If that sounds like a familiar ploy to exploit the dying embers of a good brand, that’s because it is. The storied names of Polaroid and Kodak have been repeatedly dragged through the mud by money-grabbing licensing deals producing irredeemably bad devices. Nokia’s aware of that history and, according to its technology chief Ramzi Haidamus, is ready to provide the first exception to it. Speaking in advance of the N1's unveiling, Haidamus told Nokia investors last week that the company will set a high bar for quality, and every Nokia-branded device ""will look and feel just like Nokia built it.""  Only time and the unfolding of the ambitious roadmap of future devices will tell whether Nokia can truly break the established pattern, but the N1 gives some hints about that future. It offers high-end specs, the latest version of Android paired with Nokia’s predictive Z launcher, and a reasonable price that can make it a viable competitor to the iPad mini. It also looks like a deliberate clone of Apple’s 7.9-inch tablet. Sebastian Nystrom, Nokia’s product chief, tells The Verge that ""when you make a product like this, where the form factor is a relatively large display, many products look alike"" and ""there’s only so many ways you can make this product."" The tablet’s aluminum design ""complements that natural interface that we created,"" says Nystrom, and his team is of the mind that ""we are not copying anyone, we are creating our design."" In many ways, the N1 is the result of an extremely accelerated development cycle. Nystrom says work on the tablet began on April 28th, the Monday after the conclusion of the Microsoft deal, and the choice of Android as the operating system was dictated by the desire to extend the use of the Z Launcher, which the company had already built for Android. Ramzi Haidamus goes further than his colleague, asserting that ""side by side we are better than the iPad mini,"" and stressing that Nokia still retains ""a huge innovation team"" even after losing a number of prominent designers and engineers in the wake of the Microsoft buyout. Nystrom backs him up by noting that the N1 was designed by ""a solid team of engineers, designers, project managers, and others"" who have already played a part in establishing Nokia’s strong design reputation. Haidamus is now in the midst of establishing a bigger presence for Nokia in Silicon Valley as the company transforms itself into a licenser of designs and patents. Like Nvidia and AMD graphics chips or ARM system-on-chip designs, Nokia’s future work will be about scheming up innovative products that others can build. ""We will have a Nokia technology group talking to hundreds of companies putting together market requirements on what is needed in the next phone or TV or tablet, and then we will build it for you and license it out,"" says Haidamus. Nokia’s main revenue generator today is the networks business providing communications infrastructure and handling large-scale industrial projects. But the company has also retained a portfolio of mobile patents and a forward-looking research division that has been working on technologies initially intended for integration into future Nokia smartphones. Nystrom and Haidamus are now working to consolidate these royalty-generating assets into a coherent business that can be a ""technology leader"" for the rest of the mobile industry. This is where Nokia is staying true to its legacy as a mobile innovator: it’ll envision the future and provide the blueprints for making it happen. The difference today is that the company won’t be in charge of the execution of those plans. The new Nokia presents itself as staying faithful to the principles of the old, but it operates in a profoundly different way. It’s not shy about embracing the most practical operating system or producing unoriginal designs so long as the final product lives up to its historic standards. The new Nokia is also a custodian rather than an owner of its own brand, as it looks to rely on companies like Foxconn to maintain its high reputation for quality. It’s a familiar name playing a whole new game.

Google filed the suit a week after The Verge published a report tying Mississippi Attorney General Jim Hood to a secret Hollywood campaign to fight Google, pinning blame on it for piracy. Hood had handed Google a 79-page-long subpoena requesting a wealth of information and interviews, which Google is now fighting back against on grounds that it violates its First and Fourth Amendment rights.  ""The Attorney General’s interference ...would likely produce a chilling effect."" The court granted Google a preliminary injunction against the attorney general earlier this month, and that's now being elaborated on in an order issued Friday. The court says that it believes Google has demonstrated a ""substantial likelihood"" that it will prevail on its First Amendment claims and that Google's Fourth Amendment claim has ""substantial merit."" This isn't necessarily a surprise — Google appeared to have a strong case, and a ""substantial"" chance at prevailing in a case is necessary for this kind of injunction — but the court's language emphasizes why it's critical here. Legal precedent suggests that Google's interpretation law — particularly that search engines are generally protected from liability in the type of piracy cases that Hood is complaining about — is likely correct. ""The attorney general’s interference with Google’s judgment, particularly in the form of threats of legal action and an unduly burdensome subpoena, then, would likely produce a chilling effect on Google’s protected speech, thereby violating Google’s First Amendment rights,"" the court writes. The court also notes that the attorney general may not threaten prosecution because Google is using its First Amendment rights. The court writes, ""Google has submitted competent evidence showing that the attorney general issued the subpoena in retaliation for Google’s likely protected speech, namely its publication of content created by third parties."" Of course, this is only the court's initial thoughts and may have no bearing on its final ruling. But it suggests that the court is strongly on Google's side for now. In response to the order, the Electronic Frontier Foundation writes that, ""although the case is far from over — this is just a preliminary order — the court’s recognition of Google’s rights under the First Amendment and the [Communications Decency Act] is encouraging, and important for the overall health of the internet.""

StubHub today announced that it's suing both Ticketmaster and the NBA's Golden State Warriors over antitrust charges, accusing Ticketmaster and the Warriors of unfairly pressuring season ticket holders to resell their seats through Ticketmaster's own services instead of the eBay-owned StubHub or another secondary market exchange. In many cases, StubHub says Ticketmaster — the exclusive ticketing partner for the Warriors — cancelled or threatened to revoke regular season and playoff game tickets if fans attempted to sell them through StubHub. In others, Ticketmaster pushed back shipping until just a few days before a game, severely limiting a customer's options for resale. Fans were also warned they wouldn't be offered future playoff seats for selling outside Ticketmaster. Stubhub says Ticketmaster isn't giving fans any choice but its own for reselling tickets These tactics have led StubHub's ticket listings for Golden State games to plummet by 80 percent in a single year, which the company says is proof that Ticketmaster's anticompetitive behavior is having dire consequences. ""Numerous Warriors fans historically have chosen to utilize StubHub for Secondary Ticket Exchange services because of its superior customer service, substantial brand equity, competitive pricing, customer protection and guarantees of timely ticket delivery and validity,"" the complaint reads. And these are hot tickets; according to ESPN, the Warriors have sold out 118 straight home games and have a waiting list of over 10,000 people for season tickets. We have filed suit against @Ticketmaster & @Warriors to protect your rights as ticket holders. http://t.co/NuWtLqzW9f  The lawsuit says this ""systematic"" and coordinated effort between the NBA team and Ticketmaster prevents fans from having a choice when it comes to reselling tickets for games they can't attend. StubHub also insists Ticketmaster and the Warriors are artificially driving up prices that might well be lower if its own exchange were in the picture. Of course, StubHub itself is often associated with the scalper market; tickets for popular shows can command hundreds or thousands of dollars. But StubHub says everyone will be worse off if Ticketmaster is allowed to continue on like this — and the repercussions could extend to other sports or entertainment events.

It's bad for my music,"" said Young on Facebook. He has some skin in this particular game, of course: Young is the force behind the high fidelity Pono media player and digital music service, which was funded through Kickstarter and became available to the public this January. Young is a passionate advocate for audio quality, but his decision isn't standing on the most solid ground. Some streaming services — like Jay Z's Tidal, for instance — base much of their value proposition on the quality of their streamed music, comparing it to what you'd hear playing a CD or listening to lossless files on your computer. There are many other factors that contribute to your perception of audio quality beyond the service you use to listen, like headphones and parent device. And when we rounded up a few Vox Media staffers to test the quality of various streaming services in a controlled environment, they had a hard time telling the difference anyway. It's possible Young is just trying to make his own music service stand out, something he can use his lauded discography to accomplish. You still have time to stream some of Young's work If you're a streaming service subscriber and you want to listen to Young's work before it vanishes forever, you might still have some time.

When Joshua Oppenheimer’s The Act of Killing came out in the summer of 2013, few had seen anything like it. In 2002, Oppenheimer set out to chronicle the victims of Indonesia’s brutal regime change, which took place in 1965 and 1966. The coup threw a pro-Communist regime out of power and installed the US-backed President Suharto in its place. Suharto spearheaded a national campaign to purge itself of Communists that resulted in one of the grizzliest genocides of the 20th century: suspected sympathizers were gutted, beheaded, and sexually mutilated. Perpetrators drank their blood by the glassful in a superstitious attempt to ward off insanity, and victims’ bodies were left in the streets or dumped in mass graves. When it was all over, half a million people were dead; nearly 2 million were locked away in concentration camps.  What Oppenheimer discovered was that not only were many of the perpetrators still in power 50 years later — individuals who freely boast of slaughtering hundreds — but they were championed as national heroes. So Oppenheimer pivoted toward the killers, casting them to recreate their deeds in a Hollywood-style film. It was an unorthodox conceit, but for the first time in half a century the killers were forced to confront their own crimes in a perverse sort of play therapy. NPR’s Bob Mandello called The Act of Killing “a virtually unprecedented social document”; it garnered an Oscar nomination and won a BAFTA for best documentary.    With The Look of Silence, Oppenheimer turns his gaze back to his original subjects: the survivors living in a country where killers rule with impunity. The central character in The Look of Silence is Adi, an optometrist whose work naturally brings him to the homes of the elderly — perpetrators, victims, and relatives of both. There, he openly confronts the killers, asking them to take moral responsibility for their actions — his brother Ramli, we learn, was one of those killed, his body mutilated and dumped into North Sumatra’s Snake River along with 10,500 others. But no one will take take on the burden of Ramli’s death — instead the killers twist and bend like contortionists, deflecting accountability. Because the perpetrators are still in power, Adi’s quest is a harrowing one. When he asks a former death squad commander one question too many, the room freezes. The commander turns on his interrogator. ""These days subversives are everywhere,"" he says, looking at Adi. ""Maybe what you’re doing now is a secret communist activity."" Forgetting the past is a luxury that nobody here has Over and over, Adi is told to let the past be just that. ""It’s covered up,"" a victim tells him, ""why open it up again?"" But as The Look of Silence makes evident, forgetting is a luxury neither the victims nor the perpetrators have — the past is never really the past, it has a nagging habit of enveloping the present. When I sat down with Oppenheimer two years ago to discuss The Act of Killing, he told me that ""the aim of art is to give people a space to see what they already know so that they can talk about it, so that the narrative can start to change. So much of the way we talk, and cope with the world, is founded on silence, on not saying things that we know."" Even more so than the The Act of Killing, The Look of Silence reflects that. Earlier this month I met up with Oppenheimer again to discuss his new film, Adi, and what drives masochistic violence. Michael Zelenko: How did you first meet Adi and his family, and where did the inspiration for this film come from? Joshua Oppenheimer: In 2003, I began working with survivors of the 1965 genocide to explore what it’s like for them to live constantly afraid that they could be attacked or killed. I began that work with Adi and his family — Adi would bring relatives and neighbors and cousins to tell me their stories. Sometimes they would arrive in tears — not because they were afraid to talk — but because the only times they’ve been summoned by any outsider was to be called to do forced labor by the military. The idea of being invited to something they didn’t quite understand was traumatic. Terribly, three weeks into this process, the army came and threatened every single [person] not to participate in this film. Afterwards, Adi invited me to a secret midnight meeting at his parents' house because we were then under surveillance by the army. They said, 'Please don’t give up, don’t go home; try to film the perpetrators.' I was afraid to approach the perpetrators, but when I overcame that fear I saw that each and every one of them was open. For the first eight months or so of filming with the perpetrators, I would film them one on one. It was risky to bring them together — I didn’t know how they would talk with each other. [But] I took a risk in the January of 2004 by bringing together two perpetrators who didn’t know one another. I filmed [the two of them] going down to the river, taking turns playing victim and perpetrator, pretending — and I emphasize pretending — to be proud of what they’ve done and leading me to the spot where they killed 10,500 people. It was a horrible day for me because I was forced to relinquish the last vestige of hope that these men were crazy. Because if there was insanity here, I had to recognize it as collective insanity. The men were even worse when they were together; they were reading from a shared script. I wrote in my diary that night: two films. One about the lies, the fantasies, and the stories that the perpetrators tell themselves so they can live with themselves; the second about the terrible consequences of those lies when imposed on the whole society and what is it like to live in that society. What does it do to human beings to have to live for 50 years in fear? I had this sense that ideally [the two films] should be precisely complementary exploration of the present-day impunity. The two films are formally different, but I hope precisely complementary. It’s as though The Look of Silence is the inverse of The Act of Killing. The Act of Killing is the delirium of perpetrators’ lies; a tropical Hieronymous Bosch cut through by these silences, these haunted spaces. In The Look of Silence you’re in those haunted spaces, cut through occasionally by the footage that Adi is watching of the perpetrators boasting. One of the things that struck me in your tone when speaking to the perpetrators in The Act of Killing was how you made every effort to judge the crime, but not the individual. Adi takes the same approach during his interviews, but the stakes are greater: these people are responsible for his brother’s death, and he doesn’t shy away from that. And there’s almost a much greater risk for him. Many of these individuals are a part of his extended community and are politically powerful. I think it was from Adi that I first heard this sense that one ought to be able to separate the human being from the crime and forgive the human being, at least as an ideal. That probably influenced how I approached the whole making of Act Of Killing. I’d also say that if you understand what Adi is trying to do — to find peace with his neighbors — you have to recognize that these are not interviews. It’s not Adi interviewing them — it’s Adi confronting them, trying to break a silence borne of mutual fear that’s been dividing them and imprisoning everybody for half a century. ""This is a portrait of the human body at degree zero, human politics at degree zero, human guilt at degree zero."" I’m not filming Adi interviewing on my behalf — I’m filming a scene where Adi  is desperately trying to find reconciliation with his neighbor, having been warned by me that I don’t think they’ll be able to apologize; that none of the perpetrators will have the courage to apologize. During The Act of Killing, I worked for five years with [the primary subject,] Anwar Congo. At the end of that process, while he’s choking and retching on that rooftop at the end of [the movie] — in the director’s cut, he still says, ""I killed because my conscience told me they had to be killed.""  Implying that he’s still clinging to the lies while he’s retching; implying that this is not a redemptive ending. This is a portrait of the human body at degree zero, human politics at degree zero, human guilt at degree zero. So I felt like we weren’t going to get that apology. But if I can, with precision and intimacy and care, film the rich array of human reactions that are inevitable when someone goes into someone else’s home and says, 'You’ve killed my brother, can you take responsibility for it?' — if I can document the panic, the shame, the guilt, the fear of guilt, the fear of one’s own guilt, and of course the anger and the threats — then I can make visible through the reactions of the perpetrators and through Adi, this abyss of fear and guilt that divides everybody. More so than in The Act of Killing, we also see that these perpetrators are aging out, they’re becoming feeble. Is there a suggestion here that they’re losing their grip on the politics of the country? Well, we see different things. In The Act of Killing we’re focusing not only on the perps, but on a whole, present-day paramilitary movement that is at least two generations of protégés below Anwar. In The Look of Silence, Adi is only visiting the [original] perpetrators. Some of them are very old; some of them are not. The politician who threatens Adi is not feeble, nor is the paramilitary leader who threatens Adi. What The Look of Silence shows is that even as the perpetrators themselves are retiring, or dying, or leaving politics, there’s a whole generation who committed their own human rights abuses and massacres. In the mid-'70s, Indonesia invaded East Timor... one-third of the population was killed [there]. There are ongoing human rights abuses in the Indonesian part of Papua. But at the same time in The Look of Silence, there’s something hopeful in the sense that we see in Adi and in the daughter of a perpetrator who finds the courage and the humanity to apologize on her father’s behalf. We see that if change will come, it will come in this younger generation, who are neither traumatized by the experience of the genocide nor are directly implicated in the genocide or even the military dictatorship and its crimes — its moral corruption. The violence that we hear about in this film isn’t just brutal, it’s masochistic. There’s a performative element here that reminded me of the ISIS videos that have appeared within the last couple of years; militants straining to devise ever more cruel means of killing. What do you think drives that behavior? One of the interesting things with ISIS is that the violence and its staging — its mediation — are happening at one and the same moment. That serves two purposes that you [also saw] in the mediation of the violence in Indonesia. In Indonesia, Anwar talked about how at the time of the killings, he would distance himself from the act by imagining himself — mediating himself — in his own head, as being a beloved Hollywood actor from a movie that he’d just walked out of — acting was already part of the act of killing for him. I have no doubt that for people in ISIS who are committing crimes for the camera, that makes it easier to do. Instead of being more morally and emotionally present in the thing you’re doing, you’re performing for the camera. And also, the boasting about atrocities [creates a] mechanism of fear. If all of the death squad members have gone home to their communities and spent half a century boasting about the terrible things they’ve done, [it] implies that they could do it again. The perpetrators become a living threat in the community. Are you still in touch with Adi? I’m still working with Adi on the release of The Look of Silence both in Indonesia and abroad. There was always a back-up plan should his family be threatened to move to Europe. They haven’t been threatened, in part because the reaction to the film has been so supportive and so overwhelming. It’s meant that Adi has been able to stay in Indonesia with his family, and it meant that he’s playing a very central role in the release of the film and more broadly in the movement for truth, reconciliation, and justice in Indonesia. So in a sense, the film, through its popularity, is now protecting the survivors. Yes, certainly. The men Adi confronts were regionally powerful and enjoyed total impunity in their regions. If Adi stayed in that region, they may well have attacked him with impunity. But because Adi is now on a national and international stage, they would face real repercussions if they would leave those regions. I still receive very regular death threats that make it impossible for me to return to Indonesia. I think I could get in, but I don’t think I could get out again. That makes it impossible for me to contemplate making another film there. I make [my films] from a place of real intimacy, and I can’t do that in a country that I can’t even visit. If the first part of this story — [The Act of Killing] — was like the child in the emperor’s new clothes, making it impossible not to talk about this regime of fear in which they’re living in, the second — The Look of Silence — makes it impossible not to talk about how torn the society is. The third part of this story is the future, the struggle for truth, reconciliation, and justice. It may be a very long struggle and a very difficult struggle, and as far as it’s the third chapter to this story, it will not be written by me. It will be written by the people of Indonesia.

Our editor Dan Lebental and Kevin Feige both got the Apple Watch, like day one.” I’m in a conference room in Burbank, and Ant-Man director Peyton Reed is scarfing down some breakfast — and talking smartwatches. “You’ll be sitting in the cutting room, and all of a sudden one of them will stand up, and it’s like, ‘Is there a fire drill?’ ‘No my watch just told me to stand up.’”  He smiles and leans forward. “And my comment was, ‘What if your watch tells you to assassinate someone?’”  If the filmmaker is feeling a little mischievous, he’s got good reason. Just a few days before we sat down, Ant-Man press screenings began, and despite the collective “meh” that followed the news of his hiring — he replaced Edgar Wright, who left due to creative differences — early reactions are quite good. Buoyed by Paul Rudd’s performance as Scott Lang, it’s a different kind of Marvel movie, one that’s smaller in scale and not afraid to embrace the goofier aspects of the genre. I chatted with Reed about taking over from Wright and how he made the movie his own.  Warning: mild spoilers for Ant-Man below. Bryan Bishop: This project pretty famously had a well-known director who had been developing it for years, then stepped away in a high-profile way. How did you approach that situation when you came on board? Peyton Reed: As a fan, I was sort of watching and reading: ""I’m psyched to see Ant-Man, I can’t wait!"" And then the thing happened, and all of that preceded me. But Kevin [Feige] called. I had known Kevin since 2003; I had developed The Fantastic Four for about a year at Fox, when Kevin was a junior at Marvel, and then later I came in and pitched on Guardians [of the Galaxy]. So I came in and read the drafts of the script, and there were a bunch of drafts that had been done, and then we talked about the movie. My attitude going in was that I love Ant-Man. I grew up on Marvel comics, and I have definite ideas about the character, and I’m just going to respond to how I feel about the script. In Edgar and Joe Cornish’s original script, it was their idea to make it a heist movie. It was their idea to key off that Marvel Premiere issue, ""To Steal An Ant-Man,"" about the introduction of Scott Lang, and make it a mentor-pupil story. And I think it was also their idea to build to a third act that took place in a little girl’s bedroom. I thought it was amazing! But I also felt like there was stuff that I wanted to see from the comics that wasn’t in the movie at the time. So [Anchorman writer Adam] McKay and Rudd came on to write as I was coming on to direct. Adam and Paul were holed up at the Chateau Marmont, writing, and there was stuff that we wanted to add. I really wanted to strengthen the heist motif of the movie. There’s the section where Scott goes in to steal the suit, and McKay had called in this securities expert, and we sat with him and talked about how you would get into a safe. That whole section of Paul breaking into [Hank Pym’s house] and getting through the laser scanner, that was not in the original drafts. Also it was McKay’s idea that in every heist movie there’s a trial by fire where everything’s set, ""But we need this one element! We have to get it!"" And in this movie, it sends [Paul Rudd] on a journey where he encounters another Marvel character. Particularly with that particular character, it thrilled me. That tapped into my childhood love of Marvel comics. For all of the talk about heist movies, Ant-Man really just plays as a mainstream comedy. Was that something you were thinking about intentionally, or was that just your sensibilities coming through? I think it’s very much my sensibility, but it seemed to work with this particular character. Because I think for someone that has never seen a Marvel movie or read a Marvel comic, if you see a poster — Ant-Man! — it’s like, come on, what is that? There’s an inherent absurdity to the powers, but that to me was one of the cool things. Let’s make a movie that shows that skeptical son of a bitch what [Ant-Man] can do! We had to make the shrinking technologically, as cutting edge as possible, and photorealistic. And we had to create these ants that you really sort of bought and can invest in. One of the first things I said to Kevin was I want this movie to be tight. I want it to be under two hours. I want it to be a repeat viewing experience, and I want it to have a strong comedic component. But I also want to get some emotion, man. In the original drafts, Janet [van Dyne, the late wife of Michael Douglas’ character] was mentioned, but she was never dealt with. So McKay and Paul and I wanted to have a flashback sequence and experience [the original] Ant-Man and Wasp, because in the comic that was everything. They were the founding members of The Avengers. So we came up with that and did it, and I love the emotionality of that. And Hank Pym in the final movie is different than those early drafts. Because we had Michael Douglas, I wanted to see a tortured Hank Pym. I like that he is a guy that is motivated in large part by guilt and tragedy. The other aspect of that emotionality is Scott’s relationship with his daughter and ex-wife. It almost has an ‘80s Spielberg or Amblin Entertainment vibe, with the broken home front and center. It was one of the things from the get-go I responded to, just the domestic quality of Ant-Man. He’s a hero, but he’s got a daughter. Scott Lang’s prime motivation in this movie is to get back into his daughter’s life and to be a father to his daughter. That’s it. It’s not fame or glory, or testing a suit or a scientific theory.

The new film will take place in the land of genies, and recount the story of how the genie was trapped in the lamp in the first place.

The second major part of today's Android Wear announcement is a new Together watch face that's made by Google itself. Essentially, this looks like the company's answer to Digital Touch on the Apple Watch. After making a link with a chosen contact, you can share emoji, photos, your current activity — and yes, you can also exchange doodles scribbled onto your watch's display. It's a bit more limited than Digital Touch since you can only use Together with one other person and both of you must be using the same watch face. But it couldn't be more clear that this is Google's answer to one of the Apple Watch's more personal and intimate features (minus the creepy mime hands and ability to share your heartbeat). Google says the necessary software update to enable interactive Android Wear watch faces will be rolling out over the coming weeks. That is expected to be Android Wear 1.3. Separately, Google announced that the same update will (finally) bring Google Translate to Android Wear, so you'll be able to get translations from your wrist when traveling.

Suicide is disturbingly common among young people Suicide is disturbingly common among young people. About 17 percent of high school students in the US say that they have seriously considered suicide, and 8 percent say that they've made an attempt. Suicide is the second leading cause of death among young people in the US, after unintentional injury. Despite the numbers, the suicide rate for young men has decreased to 12 deaths per 100,000 men, from 16 deaths per 100,000 men over the course of the last 20 years. For these men, the leading method of suicide was firearms.  In contrast, women used suffocation most often — a suicide mechanism that includes suicide by hanging. In 1994, the suicide rate among young women was 2.7 deaths per 100,000 women. By 2012, that number hit 3.2 deaths per 100,000 women. Overall, firearm use has gone down, especially among 15- to 19-year-olds, and suicide by suffocation has increased.      Credit: CDC The fact that suffocations are on the rise is concerning because that method is very efficient, the CDC authors write. On average suffocation kills between 69 and 84 percent of people who use it. Suicides by firearm, on the other hand, are about 81 percent successful, whereas poisonings are only successful in about 2 percent of cases, according to data from 2010. The reasons for an increase in suicides by suffocation are unclear The reasons for an increase in suicides by suffocation are unclear, the CDC researchers write. More research is needed to look into perceptions of suicide by hanging among teens and young adults. In the meantime, the CDC recommends that clinicians, hotline staff, and various other interventionists pay attention to ""current trends in suffocation suicides."" Doing so may help them educate families and assess risk when talking to young people who might be considering suicide. Here are some suicide warning signs, and treatment options.

But a lab-made polymer could change that, as it was able to stop bleeding in rats whose femoral artery was cut, according to a study published today in Science Translational Medicine — the procedure essentially saved their lives. ""We designed a polymer that we can inject into the bloodstream and that’s able to integrate in the forming of clots, and it stabilizes them,"" says Suzie Pun, a bioengineer at The University of Washington and a co-author of the study. ""I think this has real power to save people in the battlefield."" Doctors and paramedics often use tourniquets to stop someone from bleeding out, but when injuries are internal, its hard to know where to apply pressure without making things worse. In those situations, a strong blood clot can be life-saving. forming blood clots isn’t easy when blood is pouring out of an organ Clots are formed when platelets, a type of blood cell, group together to make a ""platelet plug."" This plug is reinforced thanks to a fibrous protein called fibrin. But forming blood clots isn’t easy when blood is pouring out of an organ, because the components that are needed to strengthen clots are located in the blood that spills out. Thus, when major blood loss occurs internally, clots become weak — so weak that they break down when doctors supply patients with blood transfusions. To solve this problem, researchers decided to make a polymer that could strengthen clots inside the body, even as the patient suffers massive amounts of internal bleeding. In the study, researchers made a 3-millimeter cut in the femoral artery of 40 rats. Of those rats, about half were given an injection of the polymer solution as they were bleeding out. The rats that didn't receive the drug didn't do very well — over 50 percent of them died. But ""100 percent of the rats treated with the polymer survived,"" Pun says.     Chan et al. 2015 The polymer, called PolySTAT, looks like a ""white fluffy powder"" before it’s dissolved in saline solution, Pun explains. It was engineered using the same polymer that makes up contact lenses, in addition to a peptide that’s built to seek out and attach to fibrin. When it’s injected, PolySTAT detects fibrin and weaves itself throughout the forming clot. This strengthens it, and could help the clot stay in place in humans when doctors inject blood or saline solution to increase a patient’s blood pressure. Moreover, the fact that it only binds to fibrin means that it shouldn’t suddenly start forming clots all over the place. ""We designed this to only work after the initial clot has formed,"" says Nathan White, an emergency physician at the University of Washington and a co-author of the study. ""100 percent of the rats treated with the polymer survived."" The method is completely novel, Pun says. ""People have tried to make artificial platelets, but in terms of a synthetic polymer like this, we think it’s the first."" The researchers think the polymer could be used in the emergency room, as well as by paramedics in the field. ""Most people who die of bleeding die very quickly, before they make it to the medical facility,"" White says. Being able to use PolySTAT in the field could make a big difference in those cases. It may also help people who have blood disorders that prevent them from forming clots. And, because it only binds to fibrin, it might one day be possible to employ this strategy to break down clots that form during a stroke, by adding other drugs to the formula that can break down clots, White says. ""PolySTAT reduced blood loss, abolished rebleeding at the injury site, and increased survival,"" writes Karim Brohi, a trauma science researcher at Queen Mary University in London who didn't participate in the study, in a Science news article about the experiment. But ""drugs need to survive the rigors of the emergency environment,"" and questions about the drug’s safety remain. The polymer doesn’t appear to be toxic — ""it doesn’t cause organ damage,"" White says — but researchers still need to perform long-term safety tests to see what happens after the clot is formed. Using PolyStat will probably slow the natural breakdown of clots, but that still needs to be determined. The components that make up PolyStat have been used in humans before, but ""what we don’t know is what effect the combination will have,"" White says. ""Unless it actually saves a life, making clots stronger is meaningless."" The researchers plan to try it on larger animals soon. They will also have to try it on different types of wounds. A nice clean cut to the femoral artery doesn’t necessarily represent what doctors see in the emergency room — or what soldiers see in the field. ""Some laceration models take out a quarter of the liver,"" so researchers will have to test PolySTAT on bigger wounds, Pun says. Still, the polymer looks promising. Unlike blood and plasma, the powder can be stored in a simple container; it doesn’t need to be refrigerated. That means that it might one day make its way into the kinds of first-aid kits that paramedics and soldiers employ. Until then, the increased survival rate seen in the rats in very exciting, Pun says — ""it’s new paradigm for treating trauma."" But the polymer still has a long way to go. ""Unless it actually saves a life, making clots stronger is meaningless,"" she says.",0.18622140020117636,0.8137785997988236,0.8450210354643103,943,4.8738069989395543,445,6.0314606741573034,0,2,"Science, Report",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Instead, the company will buy chicken from farmers who use ionophores — antibiotics that aren't used on humans. ""We're listening to our customers,"" senior vice president of McDonald's North American supply chain, Marion Gross, told Reuters. animals are the biggest consumers of antibiotics in the country About 23,000 people die each year in the US because of antibiotic-resistant infections — infections that cost the American health care system over $21 billion each year. A significant decline in antibiotic effectiveness would be disastrous; the Infectious Diseases Society of America has called antibiotic resistance one of the greatest threats to humans worldwide. Unfortunately, one of the major drivers of antibiotic-resistant bacteria is the use of antibiotics in factory farms; animals are the biggest consumers of antibiotics in the country. They are given to animals on a regular basis to prevent infections, and sometimes to promote growth. But the presence of antibiotics in food production, antibiotics to which bacteria can adapt, is a huge problem for human health. Because when people eat meat raised on antibiotics, they also ingest bacteria that have stopped responding to these drugs. To address this issue — and the company's sagging sales — McDonald's will work with chicken suppliers like Tyson Foods Inc. to transition out of selling chicken raised using human antibiotics. The phase-out will be US-specific; about 14,000 US restaurants will be affected. The company's 22,000 international restaurants will keep serving chicken raised with human antibiotics, at least for a while. 23,000 people die each year in the US because of resistant infections  The move may help McDonald's win back customers; consumers in the US are increasingly interested in ""natural,"" antibiotic-free meat.

The space agency confirmed that the probe was around 38,000 miles from Ceres when it was captured by the dwarf planet's orbit. The probe will now begin slowly spiraling closer to Ceres' surface, taking increasingly detailed images as the months go by. Dawn's journey to the dwarf planet has taken seven and a half years (including a 14-month survey of Vesta, the second largest object in the asteroid belt), with the probe traveling some 3.1 billion miles or 4.9 billion kilometers to get there. Dawn's journey began in 2007, when the fridge-sized probe was launched from Cape Canaveral on a Delta II rocket. The spacecraft is equipped with cameras, infrared spectrometers, and both gamma ray and neutron detectors — all of which have been used to study Vesta in 2011 and 2012, and will now be trained on Ceres. Ceres was made a dwarf planet in the same reshuffle that demoted Pluto Ceres was first spotted in 1801 by Italian astronomer Giuseppe Piazzi, who claimed it was a planet. Rival astronomer William Herschel pointed out that it was too small to be a planet and coined the term ""asteroid"" — meaning 'star like' — to describe it. Ceres was then bumped up to dwarf planet status in the same 2006 planetary reshuffle that saw Pluto lose its planet license. Scientists hope that Dawn's observations of Ceres (and Vesta) will help advance our knowledge of how solar systems form. ""Both Vesta and Ceres were on their way to becoming planets, but their development was interrupted by the gravity of Jupiter,"" said Carol Raymond, deputy principal investigator at JPL Caltech. ""These two bodies are like fossils from the dawn of the solar system, and they shed light on its origins."" Although Vesta and Ceres may seem like undifferentiated lumps of rock orbiting the Sun between Mars and Jupiter, the two dwarf planets have very different compositions. While Vesta has a dry, rocky mantle that suggests it was once molten, the surface of Ceres is full of ice, with scientists estimating that as much as a quarter of its mass could be comprised of water. This suggests that Ceres might been formed further out in the cold depths of space, before being pulled inwards by the gravity of a large planet. This would support the most recent theories about how solar systems develop, with scientists now suggesting that the positions of planets (and dwarf planets) are more mutable than we previously believed. ""By studying Vesta and Ceres, we will gain a better understanding of the formation of our solar system, especially the terrestrial planets and most importantly the Earth,"" said Raymond. ""These bodies are samples of the building blocks that have formed Venus, Earth and Mars. Vesta-like bodies are believed to have contributed heavily to the core of our planet, and Ceres-like bodies may have provided our water."" Ceres might be home to cryovolcanoes — volcanoes that spew water and gas All images are from NASA/JPL-Caltech unless otherwise stated.  Ceres is seen rotating in this sped-up animation comprised of images taken by Dawn. The images were taken on Feb. 19, 2015, from a distance of nearly 29,000 miles (46,000 kilometers).

Hosted by physicist Brian Cox and comedian Robin Ince, each episode is a half-hour panel discussion between academics and comedians / celebrities like KT Tunstall, Eric Idle, Richard Dawkins, and even Sir Patrick Stewart. The show grew so popular that it also caught fire in the podcast world. That extra exposure increased the international demand so greatly that TIMC is coming to the United States for the first time for a short tour. The run starts this week in New York, and the show will also make stops in Chicago, Los Angeles, and San Francisco. To promote the tour, Cox and Ince took some time to speak with The Verge about the challenge of making science relatable, how to know if a strawberry is dead, and what happens if you play The Infinite Monkey Cage backwards. Unfortunately, troubles at the BBC with Skype fractured the interview in two. It's a shame — on and off the air they are a dynamic duo, though Ince prefers the terms ""the glamorous and the wise"" and ""the facetious gnome."" One thing you guys do really well on the show is that you come up with ways, whether you’re planning to or not, to relate these ideas to the audience. For example, one that’s come back a couple times is the question of ""when does a strawberry die?"" It’s one of those simple things most people have never thought about, and I imagine that’s a really great hook.  Yeah, and that one is a good example because it just appeared. I said it, it occurred to me during a discussion about something else on Monkey Cage. I just asked someone, because I don’t know about seed germination. Actually, the definition of what is alive is complex in biology. Biology’s struggled with coming up with a textbook definition of what it means to be alive. What is it? It metabolizes? Or does it need to have the means to reproduce? Does it process information in some way? Would a computer be alive if it were conscious? You go off into different areas, and we’ve debated all of those things I think on Monkey Cage at some point. But yeah, the strawberry one is great. It makes a good t-shirt as well. In some ways it’s been a tough go of it recently for popularized science, with the reversal of the BICEP2 findings and the problems we saw space-faring companies like Virgin Galactic run into last year. How do you find a balance between educating and bringing humor to people, but also setting real expectations and dealing with things when they go wrong?  BICEP2 is a good example of physics in action. That’s how science works. You make a measurement, you might publish the measurement, you might publish your interpretation of it, and then people go and check it. And often, it turns out to be wrong. In fact I go so far as to say that there are no physical theories that we currently have that are right, absolutely 100-percent right.   So I think what you can do with stories like that is you can use them to say this is how science is done. Science is often presented as being dogmatic, when actually it’s the opposite of that. I’m just writing a new book actually, with a colleague of mine Jeff Forshaw at Manchester [University], and it’s really about how to think like a scientist. And in it we say that there’s an implicit preface — the start of every scientific book or every theory, the sentence should start ""of course we might be wrong, but…"" Could you imagine if every other area of human thought began with that? Imagine if the Bible started with ""of course we might be wrong. However, in the beginning, God created…"" Fantastic!  ""Imagine if the Bible started with 'of course we might be wrong.'""  Really what that does is it shows the workings of science. The reason it works — in the sense that you can build an aircraft, or to address a current political controversy in the United States, make a vaccine — the reason you can do that is because of this process. Someone presented something, and instead of everyone going, ""Oh well that’s very nice. I don’t wish to offend you by saying you’re wrong,"" the scientists go, ""Right, we’re going to have a go. I’m going to demolish that, I don’t believe it."" That’s the process of science. So when you see it, it should be a gift to people. It’s a gift to the Monkey Cage to say, ""Well look, this is how science is done!"" And the second one, with Virgin Galactic. So I know Richard Branson, so I should declare an interest here, but that doesn’t have a bearing on my opinion, which is that test pilots are heroic. And this is what happens when you’re testing aircraft. It’s extremely difficult and extremely dangerous to develop and test supersonic aircraft, and that’s what you see. Every time you get on a commercial aircraft, the reason it’s safe is because somebody risked their life being a test pilot, and a lot of them lost their lives being test pilots. Is that the hardest thing for people only casually interested in science to resolve, the idea that not everything is 100-percent right?  ""Literally nothing is 100-percent right.""Well nothing’s 100-percent right, that’s the thing. Literally nothing is 100-percent right. What science is is the best statement of our current knowledge about nature. That’s all it is. It’s nothing else. There’s no claim to be right, because there are no absolutes in science. Our theories change over the years. But the most important thing is when you say that sentence, then you open yourself up to all sorts of bullshit. People go, ""Yes, therefore there’s a universal consciousness."" And it’s like no, no, no, stop. Science is the best view we have of nature at the moment. It is then subjected to robust intellectual challenge, to experimental challenge, to theoretical challenge, so the current statements are in no sense absolutely right, but they’re the best we can do at any given time. So if you’re putting forward some theory that says that, I don’t know, the Earth is 6,000 years old, we can say, ""Well here is the list of measurements we’ve made and the interpretations of the measurements that suggest that that’s unlikely to be the case. The more likely case is that it’s 4.54 billion years old because of this, this, this, and this."" That’s the way you need to take science. You’ve covered a lot over the years on TIMC, but is there a topic or discussion you want to have that you haven’t gotten to yet?  Yeah, god, I’m actually looking forward to having Sean Carroll on the show in LA, because I think that he’s not only a great cosmologist, but he’s also a great popularizer of science. And we’ve actually had some disagreements over the years on some areas, particularly some areas of really basic quantum theory, which is, again, part of the scientific process. I’m also interested — in my series that I’ve just had on the BBC called Human Universe, I came to the conclusion in one of the programs that it’s at least possible to argue that we’re the only civilization currently active in the Milky Way galaxy. There have to be other civilizations out there in the universe, because I suspect the universe is infinite in extent, so there must be. But if you take the Milky Way, it’s possible to argue that there are very few, perhaps only one civilization at the moment. And that would be interesting to talk to Seth Shostak, who I know has a different view. I know that he thinks there will be enough to allow us to contact at least one of them if we build sufficiently big radio telescopes and we take it seriously. I tend to like programs where I have a genuine academic disagreement with someone on the panel, and genuine academic disagreements are good things because the science isn’t settled. One of you may be right, or none of you may be right — but you won’t both be right, which is good. Is there a place you’d like to bring the show that you've never brought it before?  Oh I’d love to do more in the US, we’re just trying it out really. We’re doing four shows just because we’ve never done it before. It’s quite a big risk for the promoter, we don’t know how they’ll do, although they seem to be doing okay. And if it goes well then we’d love to come back. Monkey Cage works by accessing academics, really, and then the comedians kind of turn up. So what we want to do is go around the universities in the US, different universities with different areas of expertise to get access to different academics. It’s easy in Britain because Britain’s so small. We can record the shows in London, but we can bring academics from anywhere in the UK. But when you’re talking about the US, it’s hard for us to bring them over from the US to the UK, and it’s also hard to move people around in the US really. It’s hard to go West Coast to East Coast, and fly people backwards and forwards. So the answer to access US academics is to go to the universities. So that’s what I want to do. The great thing about it is that when you’ve got someone like Neil Tyson on, you don’t know what you’re going to talk about really. I mean we could end up talking about anything. I have no real idea. And that’s the format I like, essentially. That’s what I like it to be. Robin Ince is a stand-up comedian and writer, and an extremely funny one at that. He can talk you in circles almost like Cox can, he's just going to make you laugh hysterically while he does it. After wrestling with some of the BBC's finest computers, he was able to hook up a Skype connection long enough for me to talk to him... until he was kicked out of the studio.   If you want, you can send everything [Brian Cox] said, and I’ll just then put some kind of snide addendum to each point he’s made eloquently. Yeah I can type out his responses, send them to you, and have you mark it up in red.  Yeah, I’ll change the font. It’s funny because I wanted to ask you guys about how you feel your timing has evolved in the nine or so years you’ve done the show, but then...  To be honest, we actually are much like Stevie Wonder and Paul McCartney doing ""Ebony and Ivory."" We’ve never actually met. I record all my bits, Brian records all his — cause we just don’t get on at all — and then they glue it together. We’ve recorded every word in the dictionary, and then our producer just takes different words and puts together whatever required, whether it’s about particle physics or some kind of chemistry experiment gone wrong. So what you’re saying is the next tour in the United States might actually just be holograms of you two?  Well who’s to say this one won’t be? Either that or those cyborgs that we’ve been working on. They may well, in fact, be full automatons. This is the beginning of slow, robotic takeover, and we will not be following Isaac Asimov’s laws. I think that’s everybody’s dream as they grow up, right? To be part of the robot apocalypse?  Yeah it is, the robot apocalypse. I love those moments where people go, ""Soon they’ll be sentient and they’ll take over!"" Do you know what, it’s taken a long time, hasn’t it? To get to self-consciousness and general sentience? As much as I’m impressed by human ambition, I still think that those robots that are going to aggressively take over, it’ll be merely us that accidentally aggressively take over by pressing the wrong button. It’ll explode, and then we’re left with this kind of Walking Dead scenario of melancholy and death. I think what probably scares a lot of people from approaching science themselves, whether it’s in pop culture or them picking up academic papers, is when most people look at it as full of truisms, whereas I think your show does a good job telling people, ""Hey, scientists are wrong all the time. That doesn’t mean you should distance yourself from the work that they’re doing.""        There’s that beautiful thing, when you see the work that was done at CERN with the Large Hadron Collider and other colliders around the world, where you go, ""Oh, we’ve come up with this amazing result, and this seems to be the solution to this particular problem. By being the solution, this has now lead to 1,000 more questions."" That’s the great thing, we’re just not going, ""Well done, we will now close that book."" All of us will live lives where there will be fundamental changes in our understanding of the universe, or our understanding of the human brain, or the understanding of the behavior of particles. Is there ever a time where the audience just gets lost?  You never hear those bits. Our producer’s very good. Quite often when we’re meant to be wrapping up — or when we’re about 15 minutes over — there will normally be a point just when our producer is really red-faced and waving her hands saying we’ve got to, we’ve got to let them out now for legal reasons, before Stockholm syndrome kicks in, that’s when Brian will suddenly bring up an arcane point of physics with one of the guests. And it’s there when you think, ""This will never make the edit."" The 15 minutes of that kind of enjoying spectacle where everyone sits and thinks they don’t really understand what’s going on or what’s being said, but there is a certain delight, sometimes, in being lost. So that’s sort of the added value of getting to the show instead of listening on the radio? Yeah, this is very much the bonus track, this is the lengthy third B-side track hidden on a Nirvana CD in the late ‘90s. What happens if you play the show backwards?  What you hear is a creationist explanation of the universe. Do you think this is a hurdle that shows like TIMC could help us get over?  It’s a difficult one, because I suppose I’m trapped in my own little reality tunnel of the world, because I end up touring around the UK, Australia, and other places, often playing quite small towns. And the conversations I have afterwards with people — I have an optimistic sense that the kind of level of doubt and curiosity in a lot of human beings, in the positive way, is increasing. If you offer people the really interesting ideas that scientific human imagination has come up with, then a lot of people are prepared. As long as they’re not trapped in a very fundamental frame of mind. Some creationists are just kind of knee-jerk creationists, but they haven’t been offered any other better story. I have found with some people who I’ve met who’ve been creationism or intelligent design proponents, that once you start giving them some of the information about ideas of why creatures have evolved in the way they have through mutations relating to natural selection, and shown them some of the more bizarre images of red-lipped batfish or the blobfish and all those other things, then they are quite open-minded. I’ve had various people come up to me sometimes when I’ve been walking on the street and go, ""I came to see one of your shows, and before that I had a very different kind of view of what science meant, or what the story of life according to science meant."" I think it does open people up. You guys have brought the show all around the UK, and to places like Glastonbury. Is there anywhere different or bigger you’d like to bring the show next?  Glastonbury is always such a joy, because when you are performing in a kind of circus tent with 5,000 people who have been drinking heavily — and probably doing other things as well in a countryside field in England — and you start talking about quantum cosmology, there is a beautiful sound of brains mashing. I love doing the kind of rock venues, and things like the Hammersmith Apollo, where so many great things have occurred in the past. It’s where David Bowie retired Ziggy Stardust. We were doing a live link-up with CERN just after the results that suggested that discovery of the Higgs Boson, and it was great because the Skype link kept going down, and of course we’re talking about cutting edge science yet the science of communication is failing us. But we were standing on a stage dicking about where bands like Nirvana have played, David Bowie have played, Guns N’ Roses. And now it’s two middle-aged men trying to do a link-up about physics.   So any one of those, any music venues. I love taking this thing to music festivals. One of the things I would really like to do with this US tour, if everything works out I really hope that we could get slightly more off the beaten track as well, and not just do the really big cities. Let’s go through Texas. What about doing one from orbit someday?  That’s, uh, having met a few astronauts I find that they have a tremendous calmness, whereas I’m far too furious to be placed in any small capsule. I would simply be ejected out by those who knew what they were doing and wished to survive themselves. The idea of at least doing a show where in the background there was a view of the whole of the planet Earth, that kind of Earth-rise image that we saw, that wonderful image that was taken from the Moon, that would be an incredible sensation. Do you know what? I wouldn’t even mind if we weren't recording a show. If I just got that chance to orbit Earth, to do it outside where we attempt a spacewalk while at the same time doing a live link-up with BBC Radio. One of us would eventually lose our grip, something would go wrong, but what a death that would be, a death in broadcasting, to drift away slowly out into the solar system. I’d imagine if you’re having trouble linking up from the Hammersmith, you’d have even more trouble linking up from space. Yeah, there may well be a certain time delay issue there. You know, once we’ve terraformed Mars — at which point Brian and I will be very old, but hopefully we’ve worked some form of serum to at least keep us reading or looking through a telescope — but once Mars is terraformed we hope to do the first live event coming from there. The Infinite Monkey Cage's first show in the United States is this Thursday in New York City at the NYU Skirball Center.

Black infants are 2.4 times as likely to die compared with white infants. Black kids are three times more likely to be expelled from school compared with white kids. And when it comes to oral health, black children are twice as likely to have untreated dental cavities compared with non-Hispanic white children, according to a CDC report released today. don't underestimate dental pain or the power of an intact smile Teeth might seem unimportant when compared with other health problems, but that attitude seriously underestimates dental pain and the social capital of having an intact smile. Each year, American children miss about 1.6 million days of school because of dental issues. Children from low-income families — which are predominantly of color — miss more than their wealthier peers, who tend to benefit from dental insurance. Dental pain can impact everything from children's grades to their employment opportunities when they grow older.     credit: CDC About 10 percent of white children had untreated cavities between 2011 and 2012, compared with 21 percent of black children, 19 percent of Hispanic children, and 16 percent of non-Hispanic Asians. And those differences persist as children grow older, according to the CDC's report. During the same time period,  21 percent of black teens and 18 percent of Hispanic teens had untreated dental cavities. Yet only 13 percent of white teens had untreated cavities — despite the fact that Hispanic, white, black, and Asian adolescents were just as likely to have developed a cavity in their teens. Moreover, white children were about 30 percent more likely to have been treated with dental sealant — a plastic coating that prevents tooth decay — than black and Asian children. untreated, even though white teens and teens of color were as likely to develop cavities Dental coverage may explain some of the differences. For low-income families, dental insurance can be hard to come by, and it often takes a backseat to health care coverage. And families that qualify for Medicaid don't always get to benefit from the dental insurance it provides, because few dentists take it. This represents a huge barrier to care, says Stefanie Russell, an epidemiologist who works on oral health at New York University. ""Children often see physicians, but they don’t get to see the dentist."" And even if a child has dental insurance, the child's parents might not be able to take them to see a dentist. Taking time off may be difficult for parents who have more than one job — or for parents whose jobs aren't flexible. Cultural differences may also play a role in some cases, Russell says. For example, in some cultures or communities,  there’s a sense that ""dental problems are inevitable,"" so ""there’s no point in trying to prevent them,"" she says. And because a child’s oral health is closely related to that of their parents, the issue becomes cyclical. ""Children often see physicians, but they don’t get to see the dentist."" People should ask themselves why these racial differences exist, Russell says. Oral health isn’t discussed enough, despite the many studies that have shown how oral health can impact a person's life. And the problems that poor oral health engenders are long-lasting. ""It impacts everything from self-esteem, employability, and missed days of work,"" Russell says.

Discovered on a hilltop in Ethiopia, the 2.8-million-year-old piece of a jaw containing five teeth is giving researchers a rare look into a period that they still have little evidence on: the changes to human ancestors between 2 million and 3 million years ago. Findings on it are being published today in the journal Science.  A transitional fossil in a period we have little on ""One of paleoanthropology’s main research goals has been to fiddle the temporal and evolutionary gap between these early and later phenomena,"" William Kimbel, an Arizona State University professor and one of the lead fossil analysts, said during a conference call discussing the findings. ""It's been difficult."" The new fossil doesn't provide one simple answer, but it does start to detail the transition from Australopithecus fossils with small brains and ape-like jaws, such as Lucy, and members of the Homo genus that eventually led to modern humans. And this fossil is very much transitional: it displays traits from both Australopithecus and Homo. ""The fact that it has Homo traits so long ago suggest that the transition itself was fairly rapid,"" Brian Villmoare, the study’s lead author, said on the call.  The Ledi-Geraru research area near where the fossil was found. Image credit: Erin DiMaggio. Kimbel's analysis of the fossil is one of two studies being described today in Science. The other, a paper from Penn State University, describes the area that the fossil was found in and what the landscape was probably like when this inhabitant lived there. That study is responsible for dating the fossil to 2.8 million years through a look at the surrounding sediment. At that time, the researchers say, the area likely contained open grass and shrublands as well as rivers and lakes. ""These [studies] are important in that they add a new data point to a time period in which little is known about fossils of our genus, Homo,"" Susan C. Antón, an anthropologist working at NYU who was not involved in either study, tells The Verge. ""...The whole topic of early Homo is hotly debated, but it is becoming clearer that there are multiple early species in East Africa and that early changes include a decrease in tooth and jaw size, probably related to what was being eaten."" A related paper published in the journal Nature corroborates the new, earlier timeline for Homo, and suggests that the genus also diversified into different species sooner than scientists previously thought. However, some scientists remain skeptical that early examples of Homo belong in the genus at all.  In the Nature paper, researchers from University College London and the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Germany used a CT scanner to reconstruct the lower jaw of the type specimen of Homo habilis, a 1.8-million-year-old fossil known as Olduvai Hominid 7 or OH7 that established the species for archaeologists. ""We digitally took it apart and discovered that all the breaks were well-preserved, and that the lower jaw was more primitive than people have estimated in the past,"" says Fred Spoor of University College London. The rows of teeth were ""relatively long and positioned parallel to each other,"" says Spoor, who compares the jaw of Homo habilis to that of a chimpanzee or gorilla — though without the pronounced canines of either of these animals. The research also suggested that the idea that the evolution of our distant ancestors happened in lockstep with the development of increasingly bigger brains isn’t quite right. Spoor says that at certain points in our evolutionary history the brain just ""really isn’t important. It remains static, and you get chances in behavior without changes in brain size."" In the case of the genus Homo, these changes are most noticeable in the face, says Spoor, arguing that the development of the jaw is the clearest way to differentiate between Homo species. Although some scientists have said that different fossils — such as those belonging to Homo rudolfensis — are actually part of the same species, Spoor is adamant they’re wrong. ""We now have a very plausible scenario where early Homo emerges from Australopithecus afarensis."" ""The degree of difference between habilis and rudolfensis is on a par with the difference between chimpanzees and humans,"" he says. ""The chance you’d ever find any two examples of the same species that were that different is out of the question."" Spoor says the new studies add detail to what has been a ""black hole"" in our evolutionary history. ""We now have a very plausible scenario where early Homo emerges from Australopithecus afarensis [a species that existed some 3.9 million to 2.9 million years ago]. This is represented by the jaw that is 2.8 million years old, and somewhere between 2.8 million and 2.3 million years ago it breaks up into different lineages.""

Around 4.5 billion years ago, Mars was host to a body of water that was larger than the Arctic Ocean. At around .085 miles deep, the water would have covered Mars' surface, but it's more likely the pool was slightly greater than one mile deep. In that case, it would have covered around 20 percent of the planet, The Washington Post reports. Mars also probably had seasons The new findings come from a team of researchers who collected data via three large telescopes on Earth: the European Southern Observatory’s Very Large Telescope in Chile, and the Keck II telescope and NASA Infrared Telescope Facility in Hawaii. The scientists measured the amount of water and the amount of HDO — water's heavier form — in Mars' atmosphere. The test was similar to measuring the separation of oil and water, one of the study's authors, Geronimo Villanueva, told The Washington Post. ""If you're losing material — which the atmosphere of Mars has been doing since it was formed — you'll lose more of the light material first,"" he said. By measuring the ratio of H2O to HDO against their atmospheric rates of escape over nearly six years, the researchers were able to determine the planet's water content billions of years in the past. The research also indicates that Mars once contained several regional atmospheres and a climate divided into seasons.   It's not news that water once existed on Mars. In 2013, grooves and slopes in the planet's surface hinted at recent water flow and last year, findings by NASA's Mars Curiosity rover suggested the planet's 96-mile-wide Gale Crater was once the location of a massive lake. But today's findings suggest that Mars' water supply was not fleeting. That Mars once hosted such a large body of water implies the planet may have been habitable for much longer than previously thought. NASA plans to evaluate these findings from space with the launch of an orbiter in 2016.

The findings raise the possibility that it could be used to decontaminate farmland in Japan — a country still reeling from the Fukushima nuclear disaster of 2011. ""Agricultural products from Fukushima used to be very popular for their quality and taste, and [they] were loved by consumers all over Japan,"" Ryoung Shin, unit leader at the RIKEN Center for Sustainable Resource Science and co-author of the study, said in an email. Although agricultural products are closely screened before entering the market, Shin says farming has yet to restart in areas with high concentrations of radioactive cesium, and regional agriculture as a whole still suffers from the stigma associated with the nuclear meltdown. ""This negative image of Fukushima products can be long-lasting, and I think this is the most serious concern for them."" A promising finding for Fukushima's farmers To address this issue, Shin and her team searched for a chemical that might decontaminate the plant Arabidopsis thaliana, a mustard weed that is commonly used in scientific studies. Five chemicals were identified among a set of 10,000 synthetic compounds because they were capable of increasing the plant’s tolerance for radioactive forms of the element cesium, which has been shown to inhibit plant growth. But one compound, CsTolen A, stood out. When applied to plants grown in cesium-contaminated soil, CsTolen A significantly reduced the amount of cesium the plants absorbed, resulting in greater growth and healthier leaves. And the chemical's impact appears to be cesium-specific. It wasn't able to reverse growth problems in plants that suffered from a potassium deficiency.    Adams et al., 2015 Record amounts of the isotopes cesium-137 and cesium-134 have been detected in groundwater following the Fukushima disaster, and they take years to decay. Because exposure to high amounts can increase cancer risks in humans, previous studies have explored decontamination techniques based on fertilizers or soil treatments. But as the study authors note, chemical treatments could offer a more efficient and targeted way of reducing cesium around Fukushima, where farming is still suffering nearly four years after a tsunami dispersed tons of radioactive material into the environment. ""Simpler and greener is usually easier to sell."" The soil-based findings are encouraging, the study authors say. But others strike a more cautionary note. ""I have mixed feelings about it,"" says Stephen Ebbs, a professor of plant ecophysiology at Southern Illinois University who was not involved in the study. ""There's long been a need for cesium, strontium, and radium contamination issues to be handled in such a way that it protects the environment and food supplies."" But Ebbs, who co-authored a study on cesium uptake in plants in 2003, says more tests are needed to determine the long-term impact of CsTolen A on the environment. Little is known about the effects it could have if it enters the food chain, he says. ""This is a first step, but... I think it’s very premature to move forward with any kind of field testing."" Shin acknowledges that more work needs to be done before applying CsTolen A to agricultural fields, though she says the chemical ""can probably be used efficiently for any kind of crop plants."" Convincing regulators and especially the general public, however, may prove more challenging. ""When you add chemicals to the environment, it tends to generate a negative public response,"" Ebbs says. ""Simpler and greener is usually easier to sell to people and convince government agencies.""",0.4640425793572608,0.5359574206427392,0.8195491773753507,602,5.3521594684385381,352,6.5284090909090908,0,2,"Science, Report",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

As such, I haven't bothered buying a pair of Converse's perennially stylish Chuck Taylor All Star sneakers in a long time. Sure, I could wear them for lower-impact occasions, but I'll end up falling in love with them all over again, wearing them constantly, and doing a number on my feet. Converse apparently has old people like me in mind, because the company just released the Chuck Taylor All Star II, one of the more radical revisions the iconic shoe has had so far. Sure, Converse has released a ridiculous number of variants on the original shoe, but they've mostly been cosmetic variations. The II, however, appears to be a ground-up rebuild — like the Galaxy S6 of sneakers. The company is touting better foot cushioning and arch support, a more ""breathable"" micro suede liner, and a bunch of other features, like an embroidered All Star logo, that make the shoes even more expensive than the standard model ($70 for low-top, $75 for hi-top). A way to wear one of my favorite sneakers of all time without destroying my arches While all this innovation sounds foot-friendly to me, there's no doubt that these shoes lose a bit of style compared to their classic older brother — the match of the eyelets and laces to the overall shoe color feels like a bit much, and I miss the racing stripe along the rubber bottom trim — but nonetheless, I'm encouraged despite the fact that I'm super picky about sneakers. (My esteemed colleague, Jake Kastrenakes, is less bullish. He called the new shoe ""the worst sequel since Back to the Future II."" I countered by saying that throwing some white laces in the black shoe gets you 90 percent of the way to the classic look. He backed down.) Converse will almost certainly release numerous variations on this initial limited run (only four colors are available: black, blue, red, and white), and it probably won't be long before they release a pair of these new shoes that match the original in style. If I can get my hands on those without making my feet scream at me after a busy day, I'll be a happy camper. The first run of these new shoes goes on sale next Tuesday, July 28th.

It's not clear whether such a system would be designed for Supercharging stations, home use, or both.  Btw, we are actually working on a charger that automatically moves out from the wall & connects like a solid metal snake. For realz.  Musk had joked that he'd like to see such a system back at the launch of the P85D in October. At that same event, Tesla had talked about autonomous driving hardware that had recently been integrated into the Model S; one new feature was an automatic, electrically actuated charger port door. The CEO noted that the goal was for the car to be able to drop its driver off then automatically park itself in a garage, and the automatic door could be part of a self-charging system — but this ""solid metal snake"" can apparently work with existing cars that don't have the automatic doors. Given Tesla's recent conservatism toward long-promised battery swaps, it's worth noting that ""working on"" something doesn't guarantee the company is going to launch it quickly or at all. Still, if this happens, let's be thankful that Musk is terrified of AI — an articulating, artificially intelligent solid metal arm with a stun gun on one end doesn't sound like much fun at all.

Since the mid-'70s, San Francisco's ""Muni"" Municipal Railway has been represented by a simple, stylized emblem. Four decades on, the logo has certainly aged, but it's now an iconic design statement loved by many. In a recent blog post, local designer Derek Kim lays out his vision for a new logo. Although it maintains the basic form, Kim's version eschews the varied widths of the present logo in favor of a more uniform look, and further integrates the ""i"" at the end by making it the same weight as the rest of the letters.   The simplified logo, Kim argues, could be rolled out in a number of ways. Its uniform nature makes it ideal as a repeat pattern that could adorn the sides of buses and trams. The designer has also worked the logo onto uniforms, and rethought the design of the service's pass and signage with bold yet simple visualizations of landmarks and areas. Kim doesn't expect the Municipal Transport Agency to suddenly rethink its livery — its money would probably be better spent improving the service — but it's an intriguing prospect nonetheless.

In order to select an app, I needed to not only look at an app, but then press a keyboard button with my hand. I quickly learned that eye tracking doesn’t solve everything. In fact, the dozens of eye- and gesture-tracking companies at CES seem to be creating more problems than they’re solving.  But a few get it right. Now please, keep your hands and feet inside the car. For better or worse, we’re still under the spell of Tom Cruise in Minority Report, who effortlessly moved through time and space solving crime using only his hands. Nearly every interface company I spoke with at CES mentioned the film — its iconic interface inspiring everything from car dashboards to operating systems you control with your fingers sprawled out longingly in midair. But hoping for Minority Report interfaces is a bit of a fantasy, says Dale Herigstad, whom Steven Spielberg hired to help design the film’s futuristic interfaces. Naturally, Herigstad is showing off his own product at CES this year. It’s called InAir, a TV interface that layers information like sports scores and IMDB over what you’re watching. One would expect Herigstad’s interface to be operated with your hands, but he chose phones instead. His team started with Kinect, but realized that people are most often parked on the couch while watching TV and don’t want to wave their hands to change the channel each and every time. ""If you look at what Tom Cruise is doing, it’s rather technical,"" he says. ""A TV audience sometimes wants to have no interface at all."" Coming from the guy who helped design the PreCrime division’s iconic computer interface, I was a little disappointed. But he has a point: sometimes Minority Report holds us back more than it helps. I tried out HAL.TV, a new gestural interface for TVs that lets you wave your hand to open apps, switch channels, and turn up the volume. It worked poorly and I was exhausted after waving my hand over and over again to change the volume and switch channels. Not every device needs its own glorified gestural interface. But some do. One of the Oculus Rift’s most annoying limitations is that it simulates your vision, but not your sense of touch. When you strap SoftKinetic’s DepthSense camera kit to your Oculus Rift, however, manipulating 3D objects in space becomes a reality. I tested out SoftKinetic with a very rudimentary building-block program that let me grab blocks (with both hands at once, even!) and stack them in a 3D grid world. I felt like Johnny Mnemonic moving effortlessly through cyberspace. I couldn’t feel the blocks I was touching, of course, but I think that’s an acceptable limitation — for now. Within a couple years, this is how we’ll all play Minecraft.   Without a multicamera sensor on your head or on your computer, gesture and movement recognition is much more difficult. But always-on cameras suck power and aren’t feasible for mobile devices. While other companies fooled around with cameras and parallax, San Francisco’s Elliptic Labs has been busy tweaking its ultrasonic wave technology. Like comic hero Daredevil, Elliptic Labs’ tiny speakers constantly fire off ultrasonic waves that bounce off your hand, then bounce back into your phone, tablet, or computer mic. Then, the company’s software determines the location of your hand (or face) in space. You can scroll, switch apps, change songs, and answer calls with a wave of your hand. Most incredibly, the technology works even if your hand isn’t hovering over your screen like you might do to answer a call on a Galaxy S4. You can hold your hand a few inches to the side (or below) your phone, and gesture just as well. I was shocked the first time I tried it and it actually worked. CEO Laila Danielsen says that the company already has deals with several OEMs in the works, which means phones and tablets could have more accurate versions of Samsung’s limited-range Air Command as soon as next year. The toughest part will be explaining to consumers why they want to wave at their phone. Using your hands to quickly answer calls and change songs in the car seems like the most valid use case. Tobii also targets the car for its eye-tracking — an opportunity it sees as perhaps its most lucrative. With the company’s sensors mounted above the steering wheel in every car, you can signify that you want to make a call without taking your eyes off the road. The company’s demo also lets you change radio stations with your eyes and lets you know if you’re drifting off. A few car companies have already implemented such technology, but Tobii plans to take it mainstream. Once the iPhone launched, Herigstad says, people began to understand literal, direct manipulation with digital objects. It may have taken a few years, but today, even toddlers seem to understand the mechanics of pinching and zooming on an iPad. In order to push gesture-based 3D interfaces even further into the mainstream, Intel plans to integrate its RealSense 3D technology into a growing number of its partners’ laptops, tablets, and desktops within the coming months. RealSense works very much like Kinect, giving your computer not one but two eyes. This means your computer will be able to detect 3D objects like your hands or an object you want to scan into your computer. I demoed a whimsical music-making app that let me play virtual guitar, piano, and drums by moving my hands in the air. I could grab different instruments at will, combining them or tossing them off-screen. Intel’s demos weren’t very impressive, but they herald a future where every computer has a 3D camera inside it. At the end of the day, my hands and eyes were tired. Full-on gestural, eye-tracking interfaces are exhausting because they demand that you interact with your computers and TVs, when ordinarily I’d be lazily slouched into a chair with a remote or Xbox 360 controller in my hand. In testing many of the hottest interactive technologies, I discovered that these devices are the future — not the future of everything, but the future of driving safety and the future of gaming. And perhaps they're the future of other things, as soon as appropriate gesture-based interfaces are developed. These gestures might help doctors move an x-ray from one display to another without using their hands, or simply help you wave to close your garage door. Tobii already has 15,000 handicapped people around the world using its products to type messages to family and friends using only their eyes. Just because we’re obsessed with Minority Report doesn’t mean that’s how our future should look. PreCrime’s sensational computer interface is almost impossibly technical — and wouldn’t be useful for most games, jobs, and tools. But Spielberg’s effects crew was right about a few things — interfaces that didn’t just look good but also felt right. ""We have grown up with media that has flattened 3D and we have gotten lazy,"" Herigstad says. ""Our eyes have gotten fat, and our eyes don’t have to refocus things."" Minority Report, and more recently Iron Man, introduced the masses to direct three-dimensional manipulation, which will require a bit more work on the part of the user — but it will yield some pretty amazing and useful technology. And you won’t even have to be Tony Stark or John Anderton to use it.",0.513570720567452,0.486429279432548,0.4788442445000485,1409,4.9084457061745921,702,6.1595441595441596,1,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

But the ultra-simple Urb-E claims to be the world's most compact folding electric vehicle, and it's undoubtedly one of the world's most bizarre. The prototype device making its public debut at CES 2014 is an eye-catcher — with bright colors and polka-dot metallic frame — though whether that's a good thing is a matter of personal taste. It comes in both two-and three-wheeled models.     At 25 pounds, the majority of its weight in battery, the scooter felt even lighter than we expected. It reportedly charges in three hours, with a range of 20 miles per charge, more than enough to get urban commuters from the subway or bus to their office, or to run errands around their neighborhoods. An iPhone dock serves as a simple dashboard, showing the battery life and range in a similar way to Terra Motors' $4,500 electric scooter. The folding mechanism wasn't immediately intuitive, but it was simple enough to master after a quick tutorial. And the 15-mile-per-hour electric motor made us the envy of all others when navigating the crowded showroom floor of the Las Vegas Convention Center. Urb-E's lightness and speed come at cost, though, as the scooter's tiny fixed pedals, rear carrier, and small wheels made the taller members of our staff feel a little like clowns while riding it. Again, that's not necessarily a bad thing, depending on where you work. Urb-E is also clearly the passion of its creators, LA-based startup Ecological Mobility Solutions, Inc., who began working on the device in their spare time before deciding it could be a viable business. They plan to launch a Kickstarter campaign in February, and aim to deliver the device at a comparatively economical $1,000 to $1,500.

The gears and muscle tubes are exposed, leaving an impression somewhere between a Björk video and the Terminator. Most bystanders are startled at first before settling into a kind of baffled attention. They'll stand there for five minutes at a time, at a conference where most attendees are constantly in motion. ""I don’t think it’s nice, you laughin',"" the robot says in an exaggerated Clint Eastwood from A Fistful of Dollars. The overdriven speaker distorts his voice into a vaguely Dalek register, struggling to be heard over the noise of the conference hall. ""You see, my mule don’t like people laughing."" The overdriven speaker distorts his voice into a vaguely Dalek register He's called Robothespian, a humanoid robot from the UK firm Engineered Arts Limited that's currently set up at the IEEE booth as a demonstration of modern electronics at its best. It's an odd choice, since the actual capabilities aren't much beyond standard animatronics, but he's good at drawing crowds. ""Originally he was built as an actor,"" says EAL robotics engineer Morgan Roe, ""but now he's more of an all-around performer."" His most practical application is teaching kids about science at the Kennedy Space Center, where the uncanniness of a humanoid bot draws more attention than a human being could command. The trick even works in the sensory overload of CES. He cuts a bizarre figure, but he holds your eye. Resembling a television that has swallowed a person's head And at CES, he's got plenty of company. CES’s robotics booths have a surprising number of anthropomorphic bots, and most of them seem indifferent to the latest displays and processors. They're working another angle, something much closer to kitsch. Human robots are fascinating, but their fascinating quality doesn't have much to with the technology at work behind the scenes. It's aesthetics, not technology.    The latest model from Future Robots is another prime example. Each one costs $30,000, and you can already find them in the right Korean movie theaters. The bot, called Furo S, is basically a humanoid billboard, a 2-foot touchscreen tablet connected to a set of wheels with a second face-projection screen at eye level, resembling a television that has swallowed a person's head. The bots make money through a stream of ads, left running on the bottom half of the lower tablet. If that tablet were mounted on the wall, it would simply be ignored — but a walking robot is designed to catch eyes. As devices get smarter, we expect them to look the part Once you're primed to see that humanoid bent, you begin to see it everywhere, whether it's LG's Bean Bird or telepresence bots that subtly mimic the shape of a human body. It's the same phenomenon on a less outlandish scale. A tiny hint of humanity can go a long way towards making a device appealing, even if you don't go as far as planting a face-television on top of your smartwatch. As devices get more intelligent, we expect them to look the part, all the way down to the classic sick-folder face. ""When does anthropomorphism go too far?"" Despite that, anthropomorphism is a surprisingly controversial topic in human-computer interaction circles, akin to skeuomorphism in software design. For one camp, making a machine look human is lazy, relying on what's familiar instead of what's actually useful. But to another camp, as championed by Brian Duffy's ""Anthropomorphism and the Social Robot,"" the logic of the human is inescapable. We can't help but project human characteristics onto the world around us, and robots are no different. Instead of running from the humanoid, Duffy says, we should use the impulse strategically, deploying it as robots enter the social domain. ""What is the ideal set of human features that could supplement and augment a robot’s social functionality?"" Duffy asks. ""When does anthropomorphism go too far?"" So if the user needs to talk to a robot, perhaps that robot should have a face. If users talk to the robot enough, they might give it a face whether you put one there or not. RoboThespian and Future Robots are at the far end of the curve, but they're tapping into a powerful urge, and it shows in the crowds. In the modest goal of tempting people into your booth, these robots are doing better than a lot of the more impressive tech on the floor. As it turns out, that game is more about the human reaction than anything that happens on a circuit board.

The Yellow Jacket is a pretty basic rubber iPhone case that snaps on to a larger attachment; it holds a battery pack and electric prongs. The device takes about four hours to get to full charge. After that, the Yellow Jacket can be used to double the battery life of an iPhone or zap a wannabe mugger about 50 times.

The first versions of the Yellow Jacket, built for the iPhone 4 and 4S, were $99. The new version, introduced here at CES 2014, will cost $149 but the company has added on some extra juice.

When it first announced the phone, the company said that it imagined a future when users could swap out camera modules depending on the shooting situation, or upgrade their phone when it's no longer powerful enough to run the latest games. While ZTE is just teasing us with this idea, Motorola appears to be committed to the modular concept. CEO Dennis Woodside said last month that he sees Ara as the future of the company's Moto Maker customization program, and the company hired a manufacturing partner back in November. Woodside also says that there's already an internal prototype. In the meantime, we'll have to continue dreaming of a modular future.",0.3011246059922848,0.6988753940077153,0.3144797858348361,366,5.0,222,5.8513513513513518,0,0,"CES 2014, Design, Mobile, Tech, Concepts, Hands-on",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

You can drink it. You could brew beer in your bathtub. Maybe you already have. One of the great things about beer is that in some ways it's pretty straightforward to make. That simplicity also allows for lots of variety. You can throw in everything from pumpkin to strawberry to chocolate when it comes to flavor, but brewing for yourself isn't a great way to make money. One of the big buzzwords in tech startups is the ""platform play."" You're not building a service that just does one thing, like make beer. You're building a platform that allows anyone to do that thing, a plug-and-play system that helps drive innovation. That's the premise behind Two Roads Brewing Company, a Stratford, Connecticut startup. The company offers its facilities to so-called gypsy brewers, who can input the recipe for their craft beer variety into Two Roads system, then make beer with all the efficiencies of scale that come from having a big brewery. Making other people's recipes is known as contract brewing and isn't a particularly new concept. What makes Two Roads special is the way it approached the combination of contracting and building its own brand. It started out by building facilities that were way too large for the size of the current demand for its brand, knowing that it could fill any of that slack with outside brewers. As third parties use the platform, in other words, it helps Two Roads to scale. Sit back, relax, and enjoy this episode, no ID required. Better yet, share your ideas for beer below.

Under terms of the agreement, Google will pay NASA an estimated $1.16 billion in rent over the life of the agreement, with addition funds going toward the restoration of a more than 80-year-old hangar, known as Hangar One, that sits on the property. Google may use Hangar One, as well as two sequentially named hangars on the airfield, as a space for research, development, assembly, and testing of technology related to robotics, aviation, space exploration, and other new fields once it moves in. 1,000 acres of land, three hangars, two runways, and a golf course The deal was made through Google's real estate subsidiary Planetary Ventures, which won the ability to negotiate for the airfield back in February. Since then, Google and NASA have been working out terms of the agreement. It seemed unlikely that negotiations wouldn't work out given Google's significant interest in the land and NASA's significant interest in having some other party begin to take care of it. ""As NASA expands its presence in space, we are making strides to reduce our footprint here on Earth,"" NASA administrator Charles Bolden says in a statement. ""We want to invest taxpayer resources in scientific discovery, technology development and space exploration – not in maintaining infrastructure we no longer need."" Moffett Airfield is located toward the south of the San Francisco Bay and includes about 1,000 acres of land with three hangars, a field operations building, and two runways. There's also a private golf course. Google also plans to spend $200 million on improvements to the property. That includes work on all three hangars and creating an educational facility on the site that allows the public to learn about the airfield's role in the history of technology and Silicon Valley. Some of that direction appears to stem from input by citizens of neighboring Mountain View and Sunnyvale, who NASA says were involved in determining what should be done with the airfield. NASA also says that leasing the airfield will save it alone $6.3 million in annual maintenance and operation costs. There's no specific date for when Google will take control over the airfield, and NASA says that it still needs to finalize a plan with the EPA and the California Regional Water Quality Control Board to ensure that the environment continues to be protected around the site. After that, it can take control of the property. Once Google does take the airfield over, there are no hard details to what it'll begin doing with it. And Google doesn't say much either. ""We look forward to rolling up our sleeves to restore the remarkable landmark Hangar One, which for years has been considered one of the most endangered historic sites in the United States,"" David Radcliffe, Google's real estate VP, says in a statement.

That’s because their product, an app called CurrentC, hasn’t launched. But when companies like CVS and Rite Aid blocked the NFC readers for Apple Pay and Google Wallet because of exclusive contracts with MCX, the company was suddenly front page news. After that rough introduction to the mainstream, things got worse for MCX. A security breach let hackers make off with email information on CurrentC users. Consumers descended on the app, slamming it with negative reviews in the App Store and Google Play even though most hadn’t actually used it. Amid all the sturm and drang, the actual product got lost in the controversy. Earlier this week, we sat down with MCX CEO Dekkers Davidson to get his pitch on why anyone should use CurrentC when heavyweights like Apple Pay are already on the market. This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity BP: Why would people or merchants use CurrentC or MCX? What do you get by cutting out the credit card networks? Pay the cash price at the pump When you go to the gas station today, you'll often see a credit price and a cash price. And the difference can sometimes be 10, 20 cents a gallon depending on where the price of gasoline is pegged. If you want to go pay for gas, you have to get out, walk into a store, either make the cash payment, or say ""I'm going to fill it up"" and walk back in. So here's a world that is possible. You can drive up to the pump, and using low energy Bluetooth, the pump can actually recognize that it's Ben who's pulled up.  If you are on the CurrentC network, and you have pre-authorized a certain payment method, the merchant then has the opportunity to adjust and roll back the price at the pump to either a cash price, or something that's much lower than you'd pay with the current credit network. BP: Your system works with QR codes. I've always found them to be a little finicky and not that straightforward. So how do QR codes work on CurrentC?  On the issue of the finickiness that you report, prior to becoming the CEO of MCX over a year ago, I spent two years building a prototype system. And at first it was tentative and slow, but like any new behavior it pretty much became second nature and relatively easy to use. One of the key things when building the technology we're using is that it's quite forgiving. You don't have to hold your phone at a certain angle with a certain light, it's actually designed to read a QR code pretty quickly and we can demonstrate that to you at some point. If Starbucks can make QR codes work, we can too Starbucks is the inspiration and the leader in this space. We all talk about how people put all their attention on Apple Pay, and Starbucks has actually been doing this with QR codes, a solution that's pretty similar to ours, for 5 years. I would say that Starbucks does 5-6 millions transactions a week by using QR systems, about 16 percent of their transactions are with QR codes, and if you try it or watch others try it, it becomes second nature. It becomes very fast and very simple. If it had the problems I think it would have not progressed. Starbucks has shown that you can use QR codes and that consumers embrace them. BP: There have been a lot of high profile credit card hacks recently at places like Target and Home Depot. One of the things people seem to like about Apple Pay is the anonymity and security. MCX is about sharing information between customers and merchants, but is that something people want right now?  I think every customer will see it a little differently. I think the other pieces of what's really important for consumers is you've got to have a secure system, and I can talk more about that, and a system that also ensures consumer privacy, consumers want the ability in some cases to be totally anonymous to merchants. And if they want that, they'll get that. If they want to reveal more to merchants, they can do that, but it becomes the consumer's choice. But privacy and data security, are table stakes, must have. ""We've identified the source and we're stronger for it."" I think we all are on guard in this world that there are people who will attack systems. We had a partner's whose email system was attacked early last week. You have to be vigilant and you have to be strong, to anticipate that and correct it. In this case, we've identified what was released, which was just email addresses, we've identified the source and we're stronger for it. We think Apple Pay, which has also embraced the concept of low value tokens as we did three years ago, we're probably in simpatico on that one. I pull out my phone, I hold up my phone with a QR code that says ""I am a customer at lane six."" Now we've each sent a token and a message to the cloud that says ""I am the seller"" and ""I am the buyer and I want to pay for this transaction with the payment instrument that I've selected in my phone."" There's no piece of paper to sign, there's no printout, there's no signature to hand back. There are never credentials in my device at the point of sale, it all occurs in a secure server. So like with Apple, if anyone were to intercept the low value tokens there's nothing they could do with that. BP:  It seems that a lot of what MCX was predicated on was building a more direct relationship between merchants and consumers, but what evidence do we have that they want that? It feels like right now people are at a stage where they've seen a lot of credit card hacks happen at a lot of big box stores. What people seem most interested in right now is this idea of anonymity and security. Most loyalty cards end up lost in your sock drawer The average American household is signed up for 18 loyalty programs but they use four, maybe five. It tells me that there's friction for those who don't use the cards that are in their sock drawer or ones that they threw away. You're probably aware that CVS and Rite Aid, particularly CVS has one of the world's largest loyalty program going. Today, when you go to CVS, you pay and then you have to have a separate conversation about your loyalty program. If you want to redeem, it's a fairly tedious process. And I'm generally someone in a hurry, so for me it's even worse to be in line, behind someone trying to effect this transaction. It involves a lot of stress and anxiety. So when you show up at the point of sale for any merchant that has a loyalty program, for example it rings up $82.11, and I have $55 of credit I can redeem right now. [With the CurrentC app] I hit a button, $55 is subtracted from the $82.11, and I pay $22.11 and I'm out. I also can see the points are taken out, and also the rewards when they're added in. You can do the same thing with offers, the same thing with coupons, which is you're walking into a store, you have a coupon for Pampers, that says two for one, and you can push the button and activate that offer, at the point of sale it's done automatically. This puts all the power in the hand of the consumer to make it simple, to make it rewarding and to make it hassle free. So for us, it's a lot more than about payments. Paying by mobile is a flat value proposition, it'll be cool for a while, but we hear from our merchants and they hear from their consumers that they want something that brings it all together, that's what we're doing. You’re in a tricky spot now because your partners can’t use Apple Pay or Google Wallet, but you haven’t released a working version of your own app to the public. You’ve denied that they would be fined if they worked with other payment platforms. So I guess just walk me through what you think is the best solution there, and what the plan is and why exactly you would make the kind of decision that they did if there's no downside to them accepting Apple Pay. Look, I'm an entrepreneur, I've run businesses, startup businesses for 20 years. As CEO of this venture, I've never in my career found that you get much mileage when you tell your customers what they can or cannot do. And so we're not operating that way. From MCX's perspective, we're focused on building a compelling, affirmative, value proposition for our merchants or consumers. The respective decisions CVS and RiteAid made, and Meijer made, they have to make the decision that's best for their business. ""There are consequences, so if you decide to not keep the agreement that you made with the other merchants we're not going to put a lot of energy in helping get those merchants launched in the near term."" There are consequences. So if you decide to not keep the agreement that you made with the other merchants we're not going to put a lot of energy in helping get those merchants launched in the near term. We're a small startup venture, less then 100 people, so we're going to focus on those that are keeping connected to one another. So this exclusivity that they've acknowledged is very short-lived, I can tell you it's measured in months, not years. I would observe parenthetically that I don't think too many people complained when Apple went to market with the exclusive that you could only buy it at AT&T, which was the case for a while, and I think that was a reasonable business decision that Apple made, and they did what was in their best interest, and while Verizon customers may have been disappointed, they has made a choice as well. I think every business has a good sense for whats right for them and most importantly what’s right for their consumers, and they have to make that decision for themselves. And I think that's happened here.",0.6292829471293511,0.37071705287064893,0.17852880292660248,1792,4.44921875,718,5.8816155988857934,0,0,"Apple, Business, Tech, Interview, Report",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

Quirky, the New York City startup focused on crowdsourcing innovation, has also been working in partnership with GE to create a full-bodied ecosystem of connected devices and services for the smart home. Earlier this year, it spun out a whole new company, Wink, focused on building the app, hub, and control panels for the smart home. The problem is that studies show many people are still afraid to experiment with a smart home. ""Most Americans still don't think the smart home is affordable,"" said Beth Comstock, GE's chief marketing officer. ""Quirky today will turn that on its head. This morning it launched a bevy of new connected devices, along with a couple of other initiatives all aimed at driving mainstream consumer adoption of the smart home.  The first two items are bare-bones sensors. Overflow is a $35 unit that alerts you when it detects water leakage. Tripper is a $40 door and window sensor that monitors when something is opened or closed. It can be connected to your Wink app to automate certain routines, like turning off your lights when you leave in the morning, turning them on when you come home at night, or adjusting the heat when you open and close the window. Outlink is a smart wall outlet with a pretty compelling selling point: it can monitor your energy consumption in real time to help you better understand your bill. Now you can find out if your vacuum cleaner or blender are sucking down pennies or dimes every time you run them. Tapt is a smart wall switch that lets you program routines, control smart bulbs even when the switch is set to off, and use the app as your dimmer. Ascend is the least exciting of the new products, it's basically a converter that makes your current garage door opener into a smart opener, which you can control and monitor through the Wink app. Finally there was Norm, which Quirky CEO Ben Kaufman grandly introduced with the line, ""Today we're announcing the death of the thermostat."" It's not really clear why replacing one box with another equals the end of the thermostat, but Norm is much simpler and cheaper, at $80, than most smart thermostats. It monitors temperature in whatever room you install it, can be controlled with the Wink app, and can be easily connected to low-cost temperature sensors in any room. The Norm allows you to set and adjust temperature for an average of all your rooms or apply more finely tuned room-by-room temperatures if you have an HVAC system installed.   Where will you find a bunch of good, inexpensive sensors to work with your Norm? Quirky also announced the creation of a new micro-factory in San Francisco where it will produce custom-made sensor kits it's calling the Spotter UNIQ. The unit looks like a basic smoke detector but can be personalized to detect motion, temperature, humidity, light, sound, vibration, and several other factors. It's priced between $30 and $120 a unit, depending on how many different sensors and smart buttons you want crammed into it. The goal is to make it easy for consumers to have sensors in every room that fit their needs and to ask them only to pay for what they want. Last but not least, Quirky announced a new nationwide marketing campaign for Wink playing off of the theme of the creepy robot butler. The joke is that we've all been waiting for that Jetson's era home, with a digital assistant at your beck and call, is already here and would be better delivered  with the Wink app than a humanoid machine. It's definitely a straw man (or bot), but it's also pretty funny. For now, the big takeaway would be that Quirky and GE are powering forward in the smart home space, fleshing out an ecosystem of connected products that was already one of the most robust and readily available. Whether this will convince more consumers to start opening their wallets remains to be seen.

You'll be able to watch the network on CBS' website as well as on the Roku and Fire TV. It's also available on CBS News' Windows 8 app, and it'll come to its Android app before the end of the year.

In an industry defined by speed and sharpness, that's a revolutionary idea. But one of the big problems realizing that vision has been Lytro's hardware, which has been expensive and disappointing. So today, the company is opening up its technology with the Lytro Development Kit (LDK), which allows others to create their own specialty cameras. The first customers include NASA and the US Department of Defense, along with private companies in fields like energy and healthcare. That means light-field cameras in hospitals, battlefields, and even outer space. This kit is not for garage tinkerers The kit costs $20,000 and runs on an annual subscription, meaning you're paying that every year, something that puts it well outside the range of tinkerers. It includes a lens, sensor, processing platform, the company's software and imaging algorithms, along with a Python API. Lytro says it will update both the hardware and software to subscribers over time, so that people aren't stuck with outdated equipment or code. According to Lytro CEO Jason Rosenthal, companies have been asking for a way to look behind the curtain for years, but Lytro didn't have the bandwidth to work on other projects. ""We have a strong flood of inbound interest of people who want to leverage Light-field photography for their applications, and our response has been ‘that's interesting, but we're inventing the future of photography and that's taking up 100 percent of our time,"" Rosenthal says. Lytro says it's hand-picked four outside groups to start with, but is opening it up to a larger group with the hopes that people can solve big problems with its technology. For NASA, that's putting light-field cameras into deep space, as well as on planetary rovers. The Department of Defense is using Lytro's technology to improve existing night vision systems by increasing the amount of light that they can pick up, and lighten up the hardware soldiers have to carry around on their heads. Lytro's light-field technology allows photographers to snap a shot and choose the focus later, something that's promised to change the way people take photos. So far that technology has been limited to two of the company's own models, a first-generation camera that looked more like a flashlight, and the DSLR-like Illum. Neither has upended the camera world, though have offered a tantalizing taste at doing away with out of focus photos for the rest of time. The Illum in particular answered the question of what was possible when adding a zoom lens and higher quality components to take the idea beyond the realm of point and shoot cameras. And now, with the LDK, the company hopes to see the same kind of exploration of light-field technology into areas it wouldn't venture into. That includes things like monitoring radiation exposure in nuclear power plants, all the way down to baby monitoring, which Lytro is now all too happy to let others tinker with to find the right recipe. ""The performance characteristics of what you'd send into space are a little different from what you might put in a high-tech baby monitor,"" Rosenthal says.

Today it's adding an audiobooks section to its ebooks subscription service, giving its customers access to more than 30,000 audiobooks as part of their existing $8.99 per month subscription. That's a huge addition, and it's going to make Audible's subscribers think twice about paying $14.95 every month for only a single audiobook.  Only one of the big publishers is directly signed on for now Subscribers may not want to jump ship just yet, however. For one, Scribd won't let you keep ebooks after you cancel like Audible does. And more importantly, Audible offers over 150,000 audiobooks as part of its subscription service. For now, Scribd only has a direct deal with one of the big publishers, HarperCollins, and it gets access to other big publisher's books through deals with companies like Blackstone Audio. Scholastic is also on board, so you'll at least be able to start listening through The Hunger Games before the next movie comes out. Ebook subscriptions services have had a tough time getting off the ground because of their limited content offerings, with the big publishers generally being hesitant to sign on. Over the past year, however, Scribd has grown to include ebooks from both HarperCollins and Simon & Schuster. That's still not everything you'd want out of the much-fabled Netflix for ebooks, but it's a solid start. And more than anything, it's a great deal compared to Audible. ""Audiobooks are more than a $1 billion a year industry, and they are a natural extension of Scribd’s existing content offering,"" Trip Adler, CEO of Scribd, says in a statement. ""This has been one of our most popular requests and we’re excited to reach book lovers wherever they are and however they choose to read – or listen."" Scribd is adding audiobook support to its Android and Kindle Fire apps today, with an update its iOS app coming soon. Audiobooks can also be listened to on its website.   Audible has dominated the audiobooks world for what feels like time immemorial, and the fact that it's become part of Amazon's empire only entrenches that. Though it has a distinctly different business model than what Scribd is offering here — Audible is essentially signing you up to buy a single audiobook a month — that model is far from ideal for a good many listeners: it's expensive, and it negates the benefit of having access to 150,000 audiobooks because you can only ever try out one each month anyway. It certainly remains to be seen how well that can be challenged, but HarperCollins makes it sound like that's something it welcomes. ""Audio is a growing category and one that needs additional distribution channels,"" Chantal Restivo-Alessi, HarperCollins' digital chief, says in a statement. ""By making our audiobooks available through Scribd, we’re opening up a much wider market for our authors’ works."" Amazon has a competing Kindle service, but it doesn't have many audiobooks While Scribd may still be widely known for hosting PDFs, that's built it a big audience — 80 million monthly readers — that it can attempt to transition into paying customers (Scribd hasn't stated how many paying subscribers it has just yet). Scribd is also facing off against the competing ebook subscription service Oyster, which has also signed HarperCollins and Simon & Schuster but doesn't offer audiobooks. Amazon actually does offer a directly competing service to what Scribd is launching today. It's called Kindle Unlimited, and it lets you read and listen to books for a monthly subscription. But Amazon says that it only grants access to ""thousands"" of audiobooks — it launched this summer with around 2,000 — suggesting that Amazon's offerings are far more limited than what you'd find on Scribd. That figure is small enough to make Kindle Unlimited a nonstarter for someone who's primarily interested in audiobooks. It also costs a dollar more, at $9.99 per month. That makes Scribd's announcement a direct shot at Amazon in one way or another. It's not hard to imagine that Amazon will eventually step up its game in response, and when it does, that's likely to be good news for everyone interested in listening to a book.

CNN is reporting that two assailants were involved in the attack — one killed, the other wounded — citing a federal law enforcement official who had been briefed on the matter. That's consistent with the aerial footage of the scene, which shows two damaged vehicles outside the entrance gate: a white NSA police car and a black SUV that is still unidentified. Other shots show what appears to be a dead body outside the driver's side door of the black SUV. Further footage showed a uniformed officer being loaded into an ambulance. Local police confirmed to The Washington Post that the incident occurred on the NSA side of Fort Meade, and according to local law enforcement, NSA police are taking the lead in investigating the case. Soon after the attack, the the FBI said it did not believe the attack was related to terrorism. Instead, it appears the drivers of the car may have taken a wrong turn, and possibly accelerated through a police checkpoint because there were drugs present in the stolen vehicle. The Washington Post reports that three men met in Baltimore on Sunday night, before driving to a motel. When one of the men woke up, the other two had disappeared, stealing his car in the process. The car — a Ford Escape — later took a restricted exit while heading south on the Baltimore-Washington Parkway. Police opened fire when the vehicle failed to stop after ignoring commands.

Outside the courtroom, Pao seems light-hearted, impish even. In the elevator last week, a reporter loudly kvetched about sitting through the month-long trial, and Pao piped up: ""It’ll be over soon!"" From the plaintiff’s table, however, Pao can be inscrutable. ""Plays it close to the vest"" was a critique in one of Pao's performance reviews, and Hermle has quoted it to the jury a number of times. (Like ""aggressive,"" when applied to Pao, Kleiner Perkins meant it as a ding.) But with deliberations imminent, Pao seemed to want to telegraph her frustration with Hermle’s version of events, shaking her head and typing in intense bursts on her MacBook as the defense attorney argued that her lawsuit wasn’t about being held back by the boys' club at Kleiner Perkins; it was about ""a huge payout for Team Ellen."" Sometimes, Pao took the opposite tack. When Hermle said the infamous porn plane incident was unlikely because Pao did not complain about it in her ""hundreds of notebooks,"" Pao half-smiled and whispered to both of her lawyers, Alan Exelrod and Therese Lawless, ""There was a note."" ""It’ll be over soon!"" Around 200 people had packed the courtroom to hear the start of closing arguments. The normally chilly room was so stuffed that clerks had to spray air freshener to combat the body heat and the attendants' odors. It’s not clear how many of those bodies could see Pao’s face, but the jury had a clear view. The next day, they began deliberating. Part of the reason that interaction seemed so tense was because even now, five weeks into the trial — with glaring instances of double standards and implicit bias — it’s still possible to be swayed in either direction, anecdote to anecdote or performance review to 100,000 other performance reviews. That’s how it went during the day and a half of closing arguments. Pao’s lawyer Alan Exelrod was the most sure-footed he’s been — throwing in some John Grisham gravitas for dramatic flair. No longer tied down to individual testimony, both sides tried to spin a coherent narrative arc — Ellen Pao the entitled vs. Ellen Pao the capable crusader — tying it back to specific questions on the jury’s verdict form (except for Lawless, who went full Sheryl Sandberg during her rebuttal). Both sides tried to spin a coherent narrative arc Drawing that through-line back to the questions is vital. In the public imagination, the case has morphed into a referendum on sexism in venture capital where only 6 percent of investors are women. But inside the San Francisco Superior Court this week, the trial’s focus has sharpened and the timespan has narrowed. In the seven-page verdict form, the questions are limited to claims of gender discrimination and retaliation related exclusively to Pao not being promoted to senior partner in 2012, while three of her male colleagues were, and then being fired after filing this suit. The section about her retaliation claim, for example, asks only if ""Ms. Pao’s conversations in December 2011 and/or her January 4th, 2012 memorandum"" (the first times she explicitly mentioned gender bias) were a ""substantial motivating reason"" that she was not promoted. Meanwhile in the past few weeks, the jury has been decoding documents as far back as her offer letter in 2005. The scope of the jury's task may be streamlined, but pertinent details and anecdotes were still hard to pin down. Even into the final hour of the rebuttal, it was still unclear whether Trae Vassallo, another female partner, was only promoted because of pressure from Pao’s lawsuit. Vassallo had also complained about sexual harassment during the same time period and was initially told she would not advance. Hermle said (repeatedly) that Vassallo was asked to get more operating experience; unlike Pao she took the feedback and ran with it and proved herself worthy for promotion. No matter why she was ultimately promoted, Vassallo and the three men signed the contract at the same time. (The delay in signing paperwork has been quite fortuitous for Kleiner Perkins!) The motivation for Vassallo’s promotion is the kind of detail that could have backed up Pao's claim that Kleiner suffered from a culture of discrimination. Institutionalized bias doesn’t manifest itself in ways that can be neatly graphed on a timeline, but that also wasn’t one of the questions. Under these foggy conditions, the jury may end up leaning on which vision of Ellen Pao they believe. On Tuesday and Wednesday, Hermle argued persuasively that Kleiner Perkins was merely a competitive playing field, not biased. Pao’s close relationship with billionaire John Doerr, Kleiner’s father figure and Pao’s mentor, gave her an advantage at the firm. Pao knew the other partners thought she wasn’t a team player. They wanted her to get more ""thought leadership."" Unlike the male colleagues who were promoted, said Hermle, Pao didn’t think she needed to change. It was only when Pao realized that she was going to be fired that she retrofitted gender discrimination onto past critiques. They wanted her to get more ""thought leadership."" Hermle also had an armada of dramatic visual aids. The most evocative slide had to be ""Pao’s Numerous Conflicts: What Is the Common Denominator?"" She began the slide with an unflattering picture of Pao — the common denominator — and then listed former co-workers with whom Pao allegedly had beef. As Hermle said their names, avatars popped up encircling Pao’s headshot. The many-headed image started to look like a Hindu deity. Pop-ups were the defense team’s specialty. On slides like ""Good Partner?"" new quotes would appear as they were read aloud, like snippets of movie reviews at the end of a trailer. KP's attorney Hermle: ""You guys don't have a transcript?!"" Pao's attorney Lawless: ""No, we can't afford it.""  Exelrod, on the other hand, used clipart to illustrate a feather on the scales of justice and later flashed the verdict form on screen with the word ""yes"" highlighted to indicate where the jury should vote ""yes."" Unfortunately for Kleiner, Exelrod chose summations to hit his rhetorical stride. Exelrod has eyebrows like an owl with the ends sticking up: an acute accent on the left and a grave accent on the right. He is not as dazzling as Hermle can be. When she goes over the top, it’s like kitschy theater. (She referred to Professor Gompers, one of her expert witnesses, as ""the true and accomplished scholar dismissed and demeaned as a cheerleader for the venture capital community,"" like we were in Parliament.) When Exelrod emphasizes a point, everyone is confused as to why he started yelling. But his conclusions were forceful:  ""Ellen Pao drove the returns, the men received the promotions,"" he said. ""Men were judged by one standard and women by another."" Pao is seeking $16 million in compensatory damages for lost wages, as well as punitive damages, which could be as high as $144 million. In order for the jury to vote yes on that, however, they have to decide that Kleiner acted with malice, fraud, or oppression. So Exelrod said ""fraud"" and ""fraudulent"" like it was going out of style. It was all in reference to the fact that two names of partners were removed as contributors from a performance review that initially called for her to be pushed out. One of the names was Ajit Nazre, a partner who pressured Pao into a consensual affair was later fired for sexually harassing Vassallo, and Chi-Hua Chien, not exactly Pao's biggest fan. ""It misrepresented information. It was simply a fraudulent review, and John Doerr knew it,"" he said, referencing Doerr’s insistence that they rethink it. ive seen this statement so often that ive saved it as a separate textedit file on my computer. #ellenpao v #kpcb pic.twitter.com/IQuOZXdum1  Both Exelrod and Lawless emphasized that Pao could not have been a poor performer (Kleiner’s stated defense for firing her) because she earned the firm a lot of money. Doerr made those profits explicit in an email when they first tried to fire her. Senior partners in the digital group, Ted Schlein and Matt Murphy, held her to a double standard and prevented her from focusing on investing from the beginning, urging her to stick to one board a year. Lip service to diversity aside, women could not advance within Kleiner Perkins. Yes, they said, Kleiner had high-profile female investors like Mary Meeker and Beth Seidenberg, but they came in with established careers. Yes, Pao was abrasive, but so, by their own employee’s admission, was Chi-Hua Chien. ""A woman has a chip on her shoulder; Chi-hua Chien, he gets promoted,"" Exelrod said. Despite the opposing versions of Pao they tried to evoke, closing arguments ended up highlighting similarities between the legal strategies for the plaintiff and the defense. Both claimed the other side was distracting from the real issue. ""All the finger pointing was designed to distract you from one thing and one thing only, the clear lack of evidence,"" said Hermle. Focusing on the conflicts Pao had with co-workers rather than her qualifications? ""The epitome of distraction,"" according to Exelrod. Both made note-taking related to a lawsuit sound nefarious. Kleiner was scheming when, days after Pao filed the lawsuit, partner Matt Murphy started taking notes in his coaching meetings with her that made her sound incompetent. Pao was scheming with her 100 notebooks and emails to friends about her rights as an employee. Who knew lawyers could find lawsuits so unseemly? The only clues about how the jury might interpret this tangle of assertions comes from the questions that Judge Kahn allowed them to ask after every witness. (They can keep asking during deliberations as well.) Over the past month, the jurors have proven themselves to be astute observers, catching inconsistencies sometimes by virtue of being foreign to venture financing, where (passive-aggressive) emails are sent at all hours and on holidays, or where, as Hermle said, profitability is a ""crazy criteria"" for a successful investor, but the ""thought leader"" is king. Jury question! They want another look at Trae Vassallo's testimony on being asked to take notes at a meeting. #EllenPao v. #KleinerPerkins ",0.4168662897979372,0.5831337102020628,0.8532333943677294,1736,5.0673963133640552,888,6.5011261261261257,0,0,"Culture, Policy & Law, Tech, US & World",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

But today, it admitted in a roundabout way just how deep its ties into the government go as it defended itself against claims it tampered with an FTC investigation back in 2012. Last week, a Wall Street Journal report suggested Google tampered with an FTC investigation that was looking to see if the search giant was engaging in anti-competitive practices. While the FTC ultimately decided not to bring a lawsuit against Google, reports published by the WSJ indicated the commission was deeply divided on whether it should sue — and another report exposed the close ties that Google has with the Obama administration. The implication was that Google used its influence in the White House to ultimately sway the FTC's decision in its favor — something that Google is now vigorously denying in an unusual post today on its public policy blog. Google is defending itself with a bit of snark and some GIFs In the post, Google takes aim at News Corp executive chairman Rupert Murdoch and CEO Robert Thomson directly, saying that The Wall Street Journal was incorrectly reporting that Google ""wielded undue political influence"" in its dealings with the US government. While it's not unusual to see Google come out and defend itself, the manner in which it is doing so is rather strange — the blog post has numerous GIFs (including a crying baby) as well as pretty flippant and dismissive language. Google's basic argument echoes the FTC's statement on the issue from earlier this week: the FTC's decision on the allegations ""was in accord with the recommendations of the FTC's Bureau of Competition, Bureau of Economics, and Office of General Counsel,"" and that ""not a single fact is offered to substantiate [The Wall Street Journal's] misleading narrative."" Google obviously supports that version of the story, saying that the FTC's findings prove that ""Google ""has strong pro-competitive arguments"" on its side. The biggest company in Mountain View isn't happy with the Wall Street Journal Regarding the claimed influence Google has over the government, the company does admit that it has had ""many meetings at the White House over the years."" However, Google is quick to note that it is far from alone in that regard, saying that Microsoft had 270 visits and Comcast had 150 over the same time period as Google did when it visited the White House about 230 times. Humorously, Google tries to imply that a bunch of those visits were for technical support, curiously saying that ""over five"" of its visits were for support of the administration's botched Healthcare.gov launch. It also claims that 33 more of those visits were by people who weren't actually employed by Google at the time. Lastly, Google says that it wasn't visiting to discuss the anti-trust investigation — it was there to discuss a huge host of other concerns, including ""patent reform, STEM education, self-driving cars, mental health, advertising, internet censorship,"" and a host of others. Ironically, Google's attempt at claiming it doesn't have influence in the government goes a long way towards showing just how much of a seat at the table the company really has.",0.3715232350188847,0.6284767649811154,0.1760970186380748,564,4.9875886524822697,306,6.1111111111111107,0,0,"Google, Policy & Law, Tech, US & World",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

There was a dramatic, last minute upset when Judge Kahn realized there was a miscount on the fourth claim. They needed nine out of 12 jurors for a decision and only eight voted ""no."" They went back into deliberations and came back with nine out of 12. There was a dramatic, last minute upset Among Pao's claims, the gender discrimination claim was the most consequential. On that, 10 of the jurors voted ""no."" The fourth claim was around her termination from the firm in October, 2012. Pao alleged raising concerns about gender bias and filing this lawsuit in May of 2012 were a ""substantial motivating reason"" for Kleiner Perkins to fire her. Pao, now the interim CEO of Reddit, was seeking $16 million in lost wages and potentially $144 million in punitive damages. In a statement following the decision, Pao said that she was grateful for being able to tell her story: I want to thank my family and my friends for your love and support during this very challenging time. I’m grateful to my legal team for getting me a day in court, and to everyone around the world, male and female who have reached out and expressed support in so many different ways, and who’ve told me that my story is their story too, and that they’re grateful to me for telling my story. I have told my story, and thousands of people have heard me. If I’ve helped to level the playing field for women and minorities in venture capital, then the battle was worth it. Now’s the time for me to get back to my career, to my family, and to my friends. Thank you all very much. In its statement, Kleiner Perkins said Pao's claims had no legal merit:   There is no question gender diversity in the workplace is an important issue. KPCB remains committed to supporting women in venture capital and technology both inside our firm and within our industry.""   When Pao first filed the suit in 2012, breaking ranks by refusing to settle, the case sparked discussion about the tech industry as a self-described meritocracy. Silicon Valley feminists ""needed a win,"" but this was not the case. Jurors had seven pages of questions to answer Pao was seeking $16 million in compensatory damages for lost income because she was not promoted and terminated after filing this lawsuit. The six men and six women who decided this case were given 14 pages of instruction and a seven pages of questions to answer to determine liability, so it took awhile to read their responses. Judge Harold Kahn had put off telling the jury how much Pao's Reddit stock options are worth, as well as the estimated loss of carried interest until they got to the compensatory damages part of deliberations, if they got there at all. Carried interest refers to a share of the profits in Kleiner Perkins' individual funds. Kleiner would have argued that the money Pao stands to make at Reddit should be taken into account to assess lost wages. The plaintiff's attorneys would have argued that if she had been made a general partner, she would have been given carried interest, just as the male colleagues who were promoted. The other significant number the jury would have needed to decide punitive damages is the financial worth of Kleiner Perkins itself. Earlier today the lawyers were arguing before Judge Kahn about whether compensatory and punitive damages should be split into two phases. Kleiner Perkins lawyer Lynne Hermle argued for two phases. Pao was seeking damages on four claims: 1. Kleiner Perkins discriminated against her because of her gender by failing to promote her and/or by terminating her employment.  2. Kleiner Perkins retaliated against her by failing to promote her because she complained about gender bias at the firm 3. Kleiner Perkins failed to take all reasonable steps to prevent gender discrimination against her. 4. Kleiner Perkins retaliated against her by terminating her employment because she complained about gender bias at Kleiner Perkins and/or filed this lawsuit. Instructions to the jury put strict limitations on the second and fourth claims. The jury could only consider conversations that Pao had in December of 2011 (the first time she explicitly mentioned gender bias) a formal memo she gave Kleiner in 2012. The conversations were with billionaire Kleiner Perkins partner John Doerr, Pao's former mentor. The instructions to the jury were careful to note that Pao was not making a claim for sexual harassment. ""Pao's experience was not representative of women in the tech sector."" Over the course of the month-long trial, the intricacies of the case made it clear that Pao's experience was not representative of women in the tech sector. Kleiner Perkins was likewise not representative of the VC industry. In 2015, the firm was 20 percent female, compared with an industry average of 6 percent. It was also shepherded by billionaire John Doerr, who advocated for gender diversity before the suit was filed. Nonetheless, the scenarios Pao described — being left out of meetings, relegated to office house work, judged by a double standard, the obligation to be likable — were very familiar. Even before the jury began deliberations, her lawsuit seemed to have had an impact. A few weeks into the trial, a gender discrimination lawsuit was filed against Facebook by Therese Lawless, one of Pao's attorneys, and a class action lawsuit for gender discrimination was filed against Twitter. Update March 27th, 4:38PM: to note a last-minute miscount of the votes in Ellen Pao's fourth claim; again at 5:20PM with the jury's decision after the miscount; and a third time at 8PM with Pao's statement.

The attack is evolving, and we're all hands on deck mitigating.  Baidu has denied any involvement in the attack, saying that while its internal security was not compromised, the company was not intentionally involved in any traffic redirection. ""We've notified other security organizations,"" the company said in a statement, ""and are working together to get to the bottom of this."" Early analysis seems to confirm this, and it's most likely that the scripts were hijacked as they crossed the Chinese Border. ""A certain device at the border of China’s inner network and the Internet has hijacked the HTTP connections went into China, replaced some javascript files from Baidu with malicious ones,"" wrote a researcher at Insight Labs. Observers are speculating that the attack was meant to enforce Chinese web censorship, knocking out any way for Chinese citizens to circumvent the country's Great Firewall. Last week, GreatFire's mirror sites came under a similar DDoS attack, which threatened to knock the service offline. Because GitHub is served over HTTPS, countries can't block individual pages without blocking the entire site, a feature that's proved extremely useful for anti-censorship services like Great Fire.

The Verge had a five-person team out there, and we saw so much and missed so much more. BUT! We had a few Nikon D7000s lying around, so we took plenty of photos. Here are some highlights from my trip:  Here's Marvel Girl. I took this photo on the line for the Assassin's Creed Challenge, this huge obstacle course in the middle of the Gaslamp District.  Oh hey, it's gender-swap Ezio!  Here are Peter Capaldi and Jenna Coleman at the Doctor Who panel in Hall H. Capaldi was a joy. It was his first visit to Comic-Con ever, and he really seemed to look at with a kind of amused confusion: Peter Capaldi's reaction to being at Comic-Con for the first time is basically ""Well shit this is weird.""   But it was great. Here, he was explaining the nature of the Doctor as compared to Missy, which is willing to make hard choices, but for the sake of saving lives. It was great stuff.  At the Game of Thrones panel, Sophie Turner and Alfie Allen addressed that scene, and how Sansa is still a strong character despite everything that has happened to her. All told, it was an interesting panel mainly because the cast and fans of both the show and the book series are all united in their not knowing what's going to happen next.

Murnau died in the United States at the age of 42 after his Rolls Royce, which was reportedly being driven by a 14-year-old boy, hit a pole near Santa Barbara.

One of the best songs on Innerspeaker, his 2010 breakout full-length, was called ""Solitude Is Bliss""; two years later, he asked ""Why Won’t They Talk to Me?"" only to conclude it wasn’t worth the trouble, and did so in the middle of an album called Lonerism.  (""But I don’t even care about it anyway / I wouldn’t listen to a word any of them say."") As the sole creative force behind Tame Impala, Parker’s interest in solitude is deeper than lyrical fancy. He embodies it, writing, recording, and producing all of the music himself. (It's brought to life with the help of a touring band.) Spending time with Currents, his magnificent third album, is like hopping into an isolation chamber he designed. This is music that wants to be untethered from everything, whether that’s relationships with other people, stylistic context, or even any sense of momentum. It’s a meditation on growth and memory, one that floats in your headphones like a body in warm salt water. And it doesn’t really sound like anything else, to its credit: not pop, not rock, just one man’s singular sonic vision. ""Elephant"" was so catchy it had you considering a BlackBerry purchase Parker’s talent and potential has been evident for a long time, but that doesn’t mean this leap forward was predictable. When Innerspeaker was released in 2010, it had a clear place in a long-standing musical tradition. Parker was making psych rock — playful and curious and bright, sure, but nothing revelatory. He also sounded very much like John Lennon, and if you had a nickel for every time a writer has mentioned that fact, you could afford to buy the album. Lonerism came out two years later, and while it was a significant leap in terms of skill level, it wasn’t a huge artistic change for Parker. ""Elephant"" may have been so catchy it actually had you considering a BlackBerry purchase, but it wasn’t representative of a paradigm shift.   Currents takes those ideas about Parker’s proper place with respect to genre and wastes no time blowing them to smithereens. Its opener and lead single, ""Let It Happen,"" is an 8-minute synth odyssey with a melody made for festival hippie dance circles, swooping, looping electronic orchestration, and about half a minute’s worth of guitars — and it’s one of the most familiar songs on the record, if only for that brief passage. I’ve heard Currents described as Parker’s great pop maneuver, but I’m not struck by its stickiness as much as by its omnivorousness: soul, funk, power-pop, ambient music, and non-Western composition are all in play here. I’m also hesitant to describe this album as some large pop departure for Parker because of the diminishment that foists on his earlier writing; he was working within a tighter set of aesthetic constraints, but he’s always been able to write a fine melody. If it's complicated, it's only as complicated as one person's mind When you sound like everything, you’re not beholden to expectations — and that’s the space Parker finds himself in now, sculpting songs that are idiosyncratic and peculiar. Take ""Past Life,"" which moves from a corroded spoken word section to a vacuum chamber choral section to dreamy, dewy R&B and back through in under 4 minutes. This is a minor track, all things considered, but it’s one that still manages to display an impressive flexibility and inventiveness. If it’s complicated, it’s only as complicated as one person’s mind. That’s another element of Parker’s grand loneliness: he’s never felt like more of an auteur than on Currents, an album that wears its studio polish and impeccable construction like a signature. Innerspeaker and Lonerism were entirely Parker’s too, but they were warm and energetic, with recognizable pieces; it was easy to understand how they’d come together in a live setting. Currents sounds like Parker conducting a personal army of single-purpose musical droids, and in its most precise and intricate moments — like the climax of highlight ""Yes I’m Changing,"" in which delicate organ and harpsichord melodies emerge and interlock with the sounds of street traffic and blocky keyboard tones — I find it very difficult to imagine any ensemble of humans making enough noise to bring it to life. It’s a man alone at the boards, building little palaces of sound.   There’s no question those palaces are built for one. Currents is a break-up album, but it’s not the vindictive or regretful statement you might expect from an album with that label. It’s preoccupied with self-examination and existential change. It’s rare for an album shaped by a relationship to lean so heavily on observation rather than judgment. When Parker judges at all, he mostly saves it for himself, like on ballooning ballad ""Eventually."" If that wasn’t enough, there’s the stunning ""‘Cause I’m a Man,"" where Parker breaks down the toxic masculinity that’s made him a terrible partner with a floating, tender falsetto. (Maybe you think he’s just using it as an excuse, in which case the song is cast in an even more pathetic light.) Parker’s not perfect, and he might not even achieve any meaningful change — ""New Person, Same Old Mistakes"" is not a promising title — but he’s trying, and Currents documents that tough, painful sort of self-assessment. Currents makes you want to seek out your own solitude Lonerism was an active album, and I spent a lot of time with it just walking around and letting it wrap itself around the scenery. (It also contains a song called ""Music to Walk Home By,"" so, you know — the power of suggestion.) Currents, on the other hand, it makes me want to sit alone in the dark and get lost in the depths of its arrangements. That’s a testament to the power and specificity with which this album renders solitude: it makes you want to seek it out yourself.",0.5330052113541102,0.46699478864588984,0.14468723811584275,1031,4.9932104752667312,553,6.3254972875226043,0,0,"Culture, Entertainment, Music, Music Review",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

But now, with the Galaxy Note 5, two of those three things aren't so special anymore. Every Android phone is big now, and almost all of those big phones are fast and powerful. And more than any of them, Apple's iPhone 6 Plus has been eroding Samsung's claim to phablet dominance. The rest of the world caught up with the Galaxy Note. Fighting all of that was always going to be an uphill struggle, so something had to change. To its credit, Samsung did just that. The new Note is different: it's a beautifully designed object that feels like it belongs to the same family as the other Galaxy phones. If you can't beat 'em with power and size, try to beat 'em with design. Oh, and don't forget that stylus. The Note 5 looks nothing so much as a blown-up Galaxy S6 — which is a shorthand way of saying it's a lovely combination of glass and metal. Of course, it has a huge 5.7-inch screen, but Samsung has reduced the bezels on all four sides compared to the last Note. That makes it more reasonable to hold in one hand (for basic tasks, anyway). The back is made of glass, too, and it curves in to meet the metal rim on the left and right, which also makes it easier to grip. I don't find the glass too slippery to hold — but ask me again once winter hits and my hands are dry as dust. What I do find are fingerprints everywhere on the gold version, which isn’t coming to the US (the white version, I’m told, is less prone to fingerprints). It practically begs me to just give in and put a case on the thing. But that would be a shame: literally every person who I've handed the Note to has expressed pleasant surprise. The Note 5 is squarer than an iPhone, and even though it also has a fingerprint-sensing home button, it's unmistakably a Galaxy. There's no getting around the size of the thing, but it's thinner and imperceptibly lighter than the Note 4. It's a more humane device than previous Notes — designed with a belief that a phone this big doesn't need to be some kind of aggressive, industrial object. But there are trade-offs built into that design. The glass-and-metal shell fully seals the internals. Unlike previous Notes, you can't replace the battery when it runs down and you can't expand on the built-in memory with a microSD card. Both of those features haven't been priorities for phone companies for a long time — but the Note was always supposed to be different, unapologetically meant for power users. The storage limitation in particular stings since Samsung doesn't offer a version with 128GB; 32GB and 64GB are the only options. Those same power users might also gripe about the fact that the processor (Samsung's own Exynos) isn't upgraded when compared to the Galaxy S6. I don't have any such qualms: the Note 5 is snappy in every regard. That's particularly impressive when you think about how many pixels it has to manage on the 2560 x 1440 screen. The screen is unsurprisingly gorgeous. It’s Samsung’s usual Super AMOLED setup, but as with its other recent phones, Samsung has figured out the right color balance and brightness settings for most users. It’s vivid without being garish and has a minimal air gap between the glass and pixels. It also has a massive 4GB of RAM — which is the one power user thing that everybody can be happy about. We've all learned that maxing out RAM on our computers makes everything faster, since it needs to access the slower hard disk less often. Yet phone makers (I'm looking at you, Apple) have been remarkably stingy when it comes to RAM. Using a phone that doesn't stint on the RAM is refreshing. Android just feels so much better when it's not struggling to keep apps loaded in the fastest memory available. The other complaint about the Note 5 is the battery size: it's 3,000mAh, which is actually smaller than its predecessor (and, again, you can't swap it out in a pinch). I can allay some of those concerns — but not all. The Note 5 held up for over 8 hours in our looping website battery test, and in real-world usage, I managed a whole day without a problem. But two days — or even a day and a half — is tougher to promise. Samsung clearly has done some optimization to get the most out of the battery, but I can't let go of the idea that gigantic phones should have equally gigantic battery life (despite the fact that larger displays often suck up more battery life at same time). Sadly, that doesn't seem to be the norm across the industry right now. Samsung does try to make up for it with really impressive fast charging. It tops off ridiculously quickly off the right charger. It even charges faster than other devices on a wireless charger, which are usually quite slow. The 16-megapixel camera should elicit zero complaints from any user. It's fast, full-featured, and takes very good photos. It uses the exact same sensor from the Galaxy S6, though the software has been slightly updated to support more manual controls, offer RAW output, and use OIS in video. The overall interface, however, is just as simple as before, and I’m glad that Samsung decided not to mess with a good thing. Colors in daylight or even medium lighting are vivid, and everything is crisp and sharp. My favorite part is that you can mostly leave HDR in auto mode and not have to worry about it slowing things down too much. Like the S6, the Note 5 is slightly over-aggressive in trying to brighten up low-light photos, which can make them a little too yellow and occasionally blurry — but those are extreme cases where even the iPhone 6 Plus struggled and usually put something out that was too dim anyway. You can still tuck into full manual control settings and the usual bevy of filters and camera tricks — the latest is live streaming to YouTube. The live YouTube interface could use a little work, though. It’s confusing to set up and configure a stream, and it also struggles to work well on anything but the fastest connections. But seriously: just double click the home button, leave the camera in full auto mode, and shoot away. There are still not enough Android phones that let me give that kind of easy advice. Now that it can't hang its hat on power or size, the Note 5 differentiates itself with the S Pen stylus. Samsung’s stylus story is better this year than it has even been. It's still plastic, but it slides out of the silo after clicking the ballpoint pen-style top. It's fun to fiddle with, but having to click it to pull the stylus out is actually kind of annoying; I'd actually prefer not to have that extra step. It only took four iterations, but I feel like the software support for the S Pen is finally where it should be. There are enough third-party apps that support it to find something you like, and Samsung's own features are genuinely useful. There's still work to do, though. In Google Docs, which is my main document app where I dearly want to use the stylus to mark up and comment, getting the stylus anywhere near the screen makes the entire phone vibrate. It just flat out doesn’t work even for a simple cursor position. Here are just a few examples of what you can do: If you pull the stylus out when the screen is off, you can immediately sketch a note down on the locked screen. The little wave of shortcut buttons you get on the screen when the S Pen is out can be customized, too. The phone will alert you if you forget the stylus at your desk. And you can (finally) annotate PDFs directly. My favorite new S Pen feature is the ability to grab screenshots of entire web pages — or anything else that might scroll off the screen. You can capture a bunch and it launches you directly into an annotation screen where you can mark it up and then save it or send it off. Look, I get it: the S Pen is still a hard sell for most people. If I'm honest, I'll admit that most of my affinity for the stylus comes from the idea of using it more than actually using it (and, yes, some Palm Pilot nostalgia). But if you find yourself wanting to mark up documents on a phone, it really is pretty great. Update, 8/25/15: After publishing this review, we learned that if you insert the S Pen back into its silo backwards — even gently — it can catch and break the detection mechanism that makes the whole S Pen system work in the first place. So be very careful with it. As of August 25th, we're waiting on a response from Samsung about whether or not it has any policies around this design flaw beyond ""follow the instructions in the user guide."" The Note 5 is running on Android 5.1 with Samsung's suite of software — essentially unchanged from the S6 here as well. Samsung's lighter touch is still much appreciated, though its color choices on the default theme are nevertheless a nightmare of pastel blue and neon green. Fortunately, the theme store is much more filled out now than it once was — so there are third-party options to tone it down to something more civilized. Otherwise, most of the ""Samsung Weird"" stuff is still hidden away and out of your face — and there's S Voice and a search field in the settings area if you need to hunt any of it down. Honestly, the fact that I can leave my feelings about Samsung’s software to the end of a review and don’t feel the need to heap opprobrium on it is kind of stunning. If the company can keep up (or even extend) this restraint, I’ll be seriously impressed. Samsung is also including 100GB of Microsoft OneDrive storage, the better to make up for the lack of a microSD card slot. The model I tested was the international version of the phone (the gold one you see pictured isn’t coming to the US), so I can't speak to whether or not US carriers will lade their usual software hassles on top of Android. My guess is that Samsung will let them, and that's a shame. Speaking of the carriers, they’re setting the prices for the Note 5 in the US, which range from $696 on Verizon to $739 on AT&T. The story of the Note 5 is the story of what Samsung can do when it holds itself back. Instead of tacking on endless features and juicing up every spec to the max, Samsung’s refining the ones it’s already created. It's making compromises on the battery and memory so that it can create a more approachable phone. And it succeeded: the Note 5 is probably the most consumer-friendly Note ever. I really love this Note 5, but I can’t shake the feeling that I miss the old, unfettered excessiveness of the old Note. It’s just a little less Note-like than before. The Note used to be something like a computer mainframe in your pocket; now it’s just a really great phone.",0.5191287371882446,0.4808712628117554,0.17137871281549444,1961,4.4890362060173379,845,5.9029585798816564,0,24,"Google, Tech, Review",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The so-called EEO-1 accompanied Apple’s second diversity report with a note meant to discredit the validity of the government-mandated data. ""The EEO-1 has not kept pace with changes in industry or the American workforce over the past half century,"" reads the Apple diversity page. ""We believe the information we report elsewhere on this site is a far more accurate reflection of our progress toward diversity."" Google, Facebook, and Microsoft describe similar inadequacies in their EEO-1 reports. It’s true that a form which categorizes software engineers as ""professionals"" and hygienists as ""technicians"" doesn’t make a lot of sense for companies rooted in technology. But the report’s top-level summary and leadership breakout do provide insight into each company’s overall diversity in terms of both gender and race / ethnicity. Better yet, since we also have the 2014 EEO-1 reports from Twitter, Intel, Facebook, and Amazon we can do an Apple’s-to-apples comparison across much of the industry. The Equal Employment Opportunity report might be flawed, but at least it’s the same imperfect metric applied consistently across all companies. But first, a baseline. In 2010, the last time a census was conducted, the US was 16 percent Hispanic or Latino, 64 percent White (non-Hispanic or Latino), 12 percent Black or African American (non-Hispanic or Latino), 4.6 percent Asian (non-Hispanic or Latino), and 3 percent ""other"" (people of two or more races, American Indians or Alaskans, and native Hawaiians or Pacific Islanders). In terms of gender, the US population consisted of more women than men: 49.2 percent male (151,781,326), 50.8 percent female (156,964,212) — but women comprised just 47 percent of the US labor force. So, how do the US tech companies we sampled compare? Click the ""show me"" buttons across the top of the chart below to sort by gender and race / ethnicity.   Key takeaways: And what about the leadership composition of some of the world’s most powerful and profitable companies?   Key takeaways: As dire as these charts appear, the tech industry is advancing toward the goal of greater inclusiveness and transparency. Apple, Microsoft, Facebook, and Intel have all released customized reports showing mid-2015 progress globally, beyond the 2014 US data provided in the EEO-1. Progress is slow, but it is happening. ""We are proud of the progress we’ve made, and our commitment to diversity is unwavering,"" said Tim Cook last week. ""But we know there is a lot more work to be done.""

Sources familiar with Microsoft's plans tell The Verge that the software giant will use the event to unveil two new Lumia handsets, the Surface Pro 4, and a Microsoft Band 2. Chinese site WPDang first reported details of Microsoft's plans, and we can confirm there will be an event to launch multiple new hardware devices. Microsoft is also planning one or two hardware surprises for the event, we're told. WPDang claims there may be a slimmer Xbox One, but a lack of rumors around Microsoft's console plans suggest this is unlikely. However, Microsoft could use the event to launch more Surface hardware outside of the anticipated Surface Pro 4. A Surface Mini had been planned for an unveiling alongside the Surface Pro 3 last year, but the device was scrapped just weeks before the launch. As we approach Microsoft's October event, we've heard whispers of additional Surface hardware but nothing solid on what form factors will ultimately arrive. The main focus for Microsoft's hardware event will be the two new Lumia handsets and the Surface Pro 4. A Lumia 950 and Lumia 950 XL have been rumored for months, and specifications for both handsets have already leaked. All that's really left is to see what these handsets really look like and how they fit into Microsoft's new Windows 10 Mobile ecosystem. Surface Pro 4 won't be a drastic change Microsoft's Surface Pro 4 won't be a drastic change from the Pro 3 as the company has promised to keep the charging mechanism and overall form factor similar for businesses that have invested in accessories like the docking station. That doesn't mean Microsoft won't make big changes, though. The software giant can increase display size and resolution, while making the Surface Pro 4 thinner and lighter. Rumors have suggested Microsoft is planning Windows Hello support for the Surface Pro 4, but it's unlikely the company will fit an Intel RealSense camera into the thin device. Instead, a fingerprint scanner on an updated and refined Surface keyboard sounds more likely. Microsoft will also unveil the Band 2 at its October event. Little is known about the device, but given the feedback around the original hardware it's a safe bet that the second version will look and feel a lot better. Microsoft has not yet officially announced any press events for October, but the company is holding a Windows 10-related hardware event at Berlin's IFA conference in early September.

At a preview event today in New York City, the lifestyle brand revealed pricing and availability for its long-in-the-works PoloTech apparel, made in collaboration with Montreal-based tech startup OmSignal. The ""second-skin"" fabric workout shirt has silver fibers woven directly into the fabric and a small, sensor-filled black box that snaps into the shirt near the rib cage, to track biometric stats like steps taken, heart rate, breathing depth, and energy exertion. Ralph Lauren first showed off the biometric shirt at last year's US Open tennis tournament, using ball boys as its lab rats. One top-ranking player, Marcos Giron, wore the smart shirt during practice as well.   Since then other biometric shirts have popped up, including ones that use micro-EMG sensors to measure muscle effort, made by a Redwood City-based company called Athos. (Earlier this year I reviewed a pair of Athos pants, as did The Verge's Ben Popper.) OmSignal, the company that partnered with Ralph Lauren for the PoloTech Shirt, sells its connected compression shirts separately — although both the PoloTech shirts and OmSignal's own shirts are only available for men. But David Lauren, executive vice president for advertising, marketing, and communications at Ralph Lauren, said in an interview that women's smart shirts are on the way. The company is working on making more casual connected apparel — such a polo shirt that could be worn all day, not just during exercise. And Lauren said a smart suit was not out of the realm of possibilities. (I just cannot even, with this level of Bluetooth-connected Americana.) As you might expect, there's a Ralph Lauren mobile app that syncs data from the PoloTech shirt. It's iOS-only at launch and currently doesn't integrate with other third-party fitness applications. Still, the aim with the app is to offer real-time analysis and workout suggestions based on the biometrics you're showing, which means Ralph Lauren is at least aware of one key problem with connected health and fitness devices: there are many that can track what you do, but not as many that tell you what to do next.

Or more specifically, the lack of it. Devices such as the Galaxy S5 were technically solid and performed well, but were just plain ugly. Samsung’s insistence on sticking with plastic materials didn’t help either — nothing makes an ugly phone worse than when it feels as cheap as it looks. A year later, the conversation is completely different. Facing slumping sales, Samsung refocused its efforts and put an emphasis on design for its 2015 smartphones. The Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge released earlier this year are the most beautiful phones Samsung has ever made, complete with premium materials such as metal and glass. Many even consider them to be in the same league as Apple devices. Now Samsung has launched the Galaxy S6 Edge+, a larger version of the first S6 Edge. It’s remarkably similar to the earlier model, just with a bigger display and battery. But it’s more visually alluring than the S6 Edge and represents the pinnacle of Samsung’s design and manufacturing capabilities. The unique, sloped sides of the display, which give the Edge its name, are something only Samsung has been able to manufacture at scale, thanks to its massive display manufacturing division. On the bigger phone, they stand out more and look even more impressive. The Edge+ practically screams “hey look at me” whenever I pull it out of my pocket or leave it on a table. I’ve yet to meet someone that doesn’t find the Edge+ stunning to look at. It also has all of the same usability issues as the S6 Edge, only on a larger scale, and it comes with a steep price tag: pricing starts at over $750 for the base 32GB model at all four major US carriers. That’s higher than the Note 5, which has similar hardware but a different design, and higher than almost every other high-end smartphone you can buy, save for Apple’s iPhone 6 Plus.  On a technical level, the Edge+ hits all of the right marks. Its Samsung Exynos processor and 4GB of RAM ensure fast performance. Its 16-megapixel camera with optical image stabilization takes tremendous photos and great video. Its 5.7-inch, quad HD Super AMOLED display is bright and beautiful and stunning to look at. The glass-and-metal construction is top notch, ultra-premium, and feels as good as it looks. The Edge+ even has a great fingerprint scanner that’s fast and accurate. None of those things will come as a surprise to those familiar with the smaller Edge — virtually everything save for the 4GB of RAM and larger size of the display is a carry-over from the original model. What the Edge+ does add is more reliable battery life: its 3,000mAh cell is able to last me a full day without issues, something that was a bit of a struggle with the S6 Edge. It’s not a removable battery, but it can be recharged any way you want: rapidly with a USB cable or wirelessly with a compatible pad, making it very convenient to top off. The usability problems I mentioned earlier won’t come as a surprise either — the Edge+’s sloped edges may look really cool when it’s sitting on my desk, but in practice they make it awkward to use. Its convex shape means you have to use a deliberate and unnatural pinch to pick it up off a flat surface, and unlike the Note 5 and other phones with curved backs, its flat back doesn’t naturally rest in the palm of your hand. But man, does it look cool. Samsung touts the curved sides as better for watching video, as they hide the bezels of the phone and make the video more ""immersive."" I disagree: even though hiding or shrinking the borders around a display does tend to make everything look better (just look to Dell’s recent XPS 13 laptop or Venue 8 tablet, which both pull off the trick to great effect), the Edge+’s curved sides actually stand out more because they distort the image on the edges. Further, the curved sides don’t fully hide the frame of the phone, and depending on what you’re looking at, can be brighter than the rest of the display. The Edge+ does have a couple of new software tricks to take advantage of its unique design, but I don’t find them very compelling. The shortcuts to favorite contacts, which you can access by swiping in from the side of the screen, have been expanded to include apps, so you can launch any app you want without having to dive back to the home screen. It’s cool and can be useful, but it certainly doesn’t need the screen to be curved to work. You can replicate its functionality pretty easily on a normal, flat smartphone with a variety of apps available in the Play Store. Samsung’s also built in live streaming to YouTube direct from the Edge+’s camera app. It’s not the first manufacturer to do this — Sony’s included it in its Android phones for some time — but it does make it rather painless to instantly start broadcasting to YouTube. I’m not convinced it will sway a lot of Periscope users, however, as it lacks the social aspect that draws many to that app. Otherwise, the software on the Edge+ is very similar to the software on the rest of Samsung’s high-end smartphones this year. It’s still TouchWiz, but the annoyances of the past have been toned down dramatically, and the new theming engine makes it fairly easy to mimic a ""stock Android"" look if that’s what you want. This year marks the first time Samsung’s software doesn’t drive me completely insane. With the Galaxy S6 Edge+, Samsung has thrown its full might, both in technical specs and design and manufacturing chops, into a single device. It's without a doubt a very capable and beautiful smartphone, perhaps one of the prettiest smartphones ever produced. But the thing about designing a product like a smartphone is that it needs to be just as functional as it is beautiful. It's a device that people spend more time with than anything else — I hate to admit it, but I spend more time looking at my smartphone than my own children, and I'm far from the only person to do that. Samsung actually makes smartphones that are both beautiful and functional: the standard Galaxy S6 is a great example, and the just-announced Note 5 is a practical complement to the Edge+'s extravagance. The Edge+ may have head-turning looks and a museum-quality finish, but when it comes down to just being a smartphone I’d want to live with and use for many hours every day, it sadly falls short.",0.5024976858560596,0.4975023141439404,0.14718485810485807,1128,4.7039007092198579,532,5.9548872180451129,0,10,"Google, Mobile, Tech, Review",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The study, published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, adds to the ongoing debate surrounding climate change and armed conflict, suggesting that global warming may already be sparking unrest. The drought in question lasted from 2007 to 2010 and was one of the worst in Syria's modern history. Based on meteorological data, the study's authors determined that the extreme nature of the drought likely wasn't due to natural changes alone, linking it to a century-long trend toward hotter and drier conditions that mirrors computer models of climate change. Although Syria and neighboring countries are historically subject to dry spells, Colin Kelley, a climatologist at the University of California, Santa Barbara and the study's lead author, tells The New York Times that ""a drought this severe was two to three times more likely"" due to climate change-related dryness. ""The entire world needs to be planning for a drier future in that area.""   Although the authors acknowledge that a host of factors led to the Syrian civil war — including corruption, inequality, and population growth — they assert that the drought ""had a catalytic effect."" Previous studies, cited in the paper, show that the drought, together with poor water management policies, led to crop failures that spurred 1.5 million people to migrate toward already packed urban areas. This exacerbated already dire social conditions, leading to the revolution against President Bashar al-Assad. More than 200,000 people have died since the conflict began in 2011. The link between climate change and human conflict is a subject of ongoing debate. A United Nations panel on climate change last year warned that continued changes in the earth's climate could lead to increased conflicts over land and resources. And an October report from the Pentagon described climate change as a ""threat multiplier"" that would lead to greater instability. This week's study suggests that we're already starting to see these effects in action, though some scientists remain unconvinced of the connection. The authors themselves acknowledge the difficulty in drawing clear links between climate change and the increasingly complex Syrian conflict, but they say their results underscore a somber reality that the world will have to confront. ""Being able to, in a specific region, draw this story line together we think is pretty significant,"" Richard Seager, a climate scientist at Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory and one of the study's co-authors, tells National Geographic.

Raynor then went to the Supreme Court, asking them to review Raynor v. State of Maryland to determine if police can legally collect ""inadvertently shed"" DNA and use it as evidence.

The flea that carried the bubonic plague is in New York City, according to a rodent parasite survey. Fortunately these rats don’t currently carry the disease — but the bacteria that they do carry hints that we should probably be paying more attention to Big Apple rodents. When the flea bites a human, it regurgitates its gut contents — and infects them as well Given that the plague only infects about 7 people each year in the US and that those infections tend to occur in the South, the plague probably won't become established in NYC. But some of the rats in the study carried Bartonella, bacteria that cause a flu-like disease. So, when a flea feeds on the blood of a rat infected with Bartonella, that flea becomes a vector. If it happens to bite a human, it regurgitates its gut contents — and infects them as well. Because people don't know about Bartonella, some people might become infected without realizing it, says Matthew Frye, an entomologist at Cornell University and a co-author of the study published today in The Journal of Medical Entomology. The disease won't kill the people it infects, but patients will get fevers that can really slow them down. The study highlights a need for more research on rats as potential disease reservoirs, Frye says. ""We've been able to do these survey since the early 1900s,"" but New York City hasn't surveyed its rats for parasites since the 1920s. People who work in the pest management industry are particularly at risk but if we don't know about them, diagnosing them becomes very difficult. Studies like this one let us know that rats and the fleas that live in their fur are a potential transmission pathway. ""fleas were just pouring off its body and that was rather shocking."" To figure out exactly which parasites reside on New York City rats, Frye and his team trapped 133 specimens in five different locations, three of which were residential buildings. They collected the parasites by euthanizing the rats and placing them in containers filled with a vapor that kills insects. The dead insects then dropped out of the fur — and any that didn't were combed out by researchers.         The oriental rat flea, the tropical rat mite, the spine rat louse, and the spiny rat mite were all unevenly distributed among the 133 rats. Because scientists don't really know of human diseases transmitted by the mites or the louse, the researchers focused mainly on the oriental rat fleas, which infected 30 percent of rats. ""That’s the one that’s been documented to transmit plague and Bartonella,"" Frye says — in addition to some tapeworms. Scientists checked the fleas and found Bartonella. This wasn't entirely surprising; medical professionals already know Bartonella is present in the city, Frye says. But knowing that rats are participating in the transmission cycle may help with diagnosis. 6,500 parasites were found on 133 rats  A total of 6,500 parasites were found on the 133 rats — a number that Frye calls impressive. One rat had 83 fleas on it. ""That was a lot,"" Frye says. ""Fleas were just pouring off its body, and that was rather shocking."" Rats groom themselves like cats, but this particular rat just couldn’t keep up. ""Given its global distribution, I am not surprised that the rat flea (Xenopsylla cheopis) was collected, though it was interesting that it was the only species of flea found,"" says Kaylee Byers, an entomologist at the University of British Columbia who didn't participate in the NYC rat study. The study is a follow-up to an October report that looked into the pathogens that NYC rats carry. Among them were food-borne illnesses and diseases that were entirely new to science. But New Yorkers shouldn’t worry too much about the parasites identified in Frye’s study. The majority of the pests found don't harm humans, though those that carry diseases that can infect people are obviously problematic. Still, the parasites' preferred host is the rat, so when they bite humans, it tends to be an accident, Frye says. ""The likelihood of them establishing a colony on a human is low to impossible."" ""The likelihood of them establishing a colony on a human is low to impossible."" As for the plague, if it was ever introduced in New York City, it probably wouldn’t be too hard to control. ""A lot of these are easily controlled with modern medicine,"" such as antibiotics, Frye says. But knowing where disease reservoirs reside makes that process a lot easier.

This species of woodpeckers feeds on the ground. The weasel likely tried to pounce on the bird while it was looking for insects to eat. When the woodpecker realized what was going on, it took off. All the weasel could do at that point was hold on for dear life. ""This was a struggle for life,"" Le-May told ITV News. The pair got about 10 feet off the ground before landing again.

The car's design hasn't changed dramatically since then, maintaining its unique smiley-face style front. The biggest difference is that the LIDAR system on top, which the vehicle uses to see the world, is now much tinier — it's shrunk from a strange-looking mount to a sleek, black cap. Since May, Google says that it's been working with a number of different prototype cars, each meant to test a specific part of the vehicle, be it brakes or sensors. This latest prototype puts the results from those tests together into one car, which Google says will be hitting its test tracks over the holidays. Come next year, Google says it would like to get its car out on the road. The car will still have a human driver to take the wheel in case of emergencies, but it'll still be a big step for Google's autonomous vehicle program.     Left: December 2014 prototype.

Though the cartoons depict the new prototype car that Google unveiled today, it looks like Inman may have only got to try out one of the existing consumer vehicles that Google has modified to drive on its own. Even so, Inman comes away impressed with the car, writing that Google's vehicle ""drives like a person, and after a few minutes you forget that you’re being driven autonomously."" Inman says the cars ""are throttled to act like nervous student drivers."" The biggest difference between riding in Google's car and with an experienced driver may be that, for now, Google has set its car up to operate with extreme caution. ""Google can adjust the level of aggression in the software, and the self-driving prototypes currently tooling around Mountain View are throttled to act like nervous student drivers,"" Inman writes. Apparently, a more aggressive driving style is being tested on Google's private tracks and has led to some scared observers. As for why Google would invite a cartoonist for a test drive, perhaps it's a matter of helping it to win over the public. The idea of having driverless cars on the road is scary for many, and it's going to take a lot of public support to get regulations in place to make that happen widely. The Oatmeal has an audience that's willing to stand behind ideas they like — and Inman's support could just help win Google some fans. You can read Inman's full impressions over at his site.

TOP CIA ADVICE: If you're a spy, try not to look nervous Although some of the information in the documents is public knowledge, advice on how to avoid being singled out for secondary screening could be useful to a variety of people. These include tourists and travelers trying to get home for the holidays, but also terrorists, drug traffickers, and common criminals.

These include: And for luggage best practice: Other tips are even more esoteric and focus on the specifics of certain countries' airport security. For example, Japanese airports pay close attention to lone Western travelers as they may be drug couriers, while in Iraq, any Kurdish passenger with a Turkish accent is ""automatically sent to secondary"" for fear they belong to a militant group called the PKK. In Mauritius, security forces watch passengers' facial expressions as they pick up their luggage, ""zooming on individuals’ faces to study their expressions""; in Hungary, one-way mirrors are used to ""monitor passengers for signs of nervousness,"" and in Bahrain, undercover officers sweep the arrivals lounge for uneasy travelers. One agent was singled out for questioning because he was dressed too casually If an agent is selected for secondary screening then they are simply advised to maintain their cover ""no matter what."" One anecdote details a CIA agent picked up for questioning because of ""overly casual dress inconsistent with being a diplomatic-passport holder."" Although security staff found traces of explosives in his luggage, the officer ""gave the cover story that he had been in counterterrorism training"" and was eventually let go. A press statement from WikiLeaks comments: ""This example begs the question: if the training that supposedly explained the explosives was only a cover story, what was a CIA officer really doing passing through an EU airport with traces of explosives on him, and why was he allowed to continue?"" The second document titled ""Infiltrating Schengen"" gives a brief history and overview of security protocols within the Schengen Area — a group of 26 European countries that have abolished passport control at shared borders.

This morning, New York City Uber users received an email saying that anyone hailing a yellow cab through Uber’s service will have to pay a $2 surcharge. New York users have the option of hailing a yellow cab using Uber’s app, or hailing one of Uber’s black cars. This summer, Uber cut fares on its UberX black cars by 20 percent and touted the fact that they’re now cheaper than yellow cabs. (Bloomberg found Uber to be very slightly cheaper.) Now the company is further undercutting the New York taxi industry, not by lowering fares again, but by hiking the price of hailing a cab through its app. Considering how convenient hailing through Uber’s app is, and that cab fares were neck-in-neck with UberX's, adding a $2 surcharge to yellow cabs is a significant blow.

But two NASA  scientists, Dale Arney and Chris Jones, suggest we skip the surface  altogether and stick to Venus's clouds, according to a report in IEEE Spectrum. To do so would require big policy changes at NASA, which has been  promoting crewed Mars missions as part of its Orion program. But these  scientists say that the atmosphere of Venus, explored by an airship, may  be more hospitable to human missions. Enter the High Altitude Venus  Operational Concept, or Havoc. ""it's a chance to do a practice run... of going to mars.""About 31 miles (50 km) above Venus' surface, the gravity is only  slightly lower than Earth's, and the atmospheric pressure is about the  same. What's more, Venus is better shielded from radiation than Mars —  exposure to radiation in Venus' atmosphere would be ""about the same as  if you were in Canada,"" Arney told IEEE Spectrum. In other words, floating above Venus' surface is attractive because it's more Earth-like. The vehicle designed to explore the atmosphere is a helium-filled  airship that runs on solar power. The idea is to send a robotic version,  followed by a larger, crewed version. The airship would have to be  folded up inside a spacecraft to get there, with humans following in a  separate vehicle. The plan even includes a suggested space colony,  floating in the clouds. The Venus idea is appealing in part because the planet is closer, and  could provide experience with technology that would be necessary to get  humans to Mars: habitats for crew members, carbon dioxide processing,  aerobraking, and other things required to allow humans survive a trip to  another planet.

For artists working in urban environments like SpY, who got his start with graffiti in the mid-80s, the CCTV camera is an obvious symbol of the government's watchful eye.

""The cameras are a symbol that represents it, however it is clear that we are surrounded by devices that act as tools of surveillance."" In this case, the cameras are truly just symbolic: they're all empty replications, recording nothing. But there's nothing telling this to passersby who might uncomfortably come upon the wall, and SpY says that he's seen a variety of reactions; some people wonder whether the cameras are on, while others assume that they are and interact with them as though they're being recorded. ""I like to generate some type of reaction with my work,"" SpY says. ""I try to awake and create a more lucid conscience with my interventions. Irony and humor are a way to make the receiver an accomplice, create a dialog, and make one think that the work communicates something with which one identifies."" In that sense, there's no one way to see the installation. So long as you see it and take something out of it, SpY's piece has done its job. It may be wrong then to say that it definitely views mass surveillance as a pointless endeavor, but the suggestion is certainly there.

Dubbed 'SkyCycle,' the cycling routes would follow London's vast suburban rail network for over 220 kilometers (136 miles), allowing cyclists to traverse the UK's capital without encountering cars or pedestrians. SkyCycle would consist of a number of routes, most of which would connect with other lines at points. Each route would be able to accommodate 12,000 cyclists per hour. The network as a whole would serve almost six million people, half of whom live and work within 10 minutes of one of its 200 entrances. As the majority of London's rail network was created in the steam era, the tracks follow the path of least resistance, avoiding steep gradients and making them ideal routes for cycling.  Reminiscent of the California Cycleway  The project is reminiscent of the California Cycleway, an ill-fated plan to connect Los Angeles and Pasadena with a very similar elevated cycle path. Despite a partial opening in 1900, the Cycleway was never completed, as commuters flocked to take the Pacific Electric Railway instead. Now, a railway could enable Londoners to live the Californian dream over a century later. Cited benefits of the plan, aside from reducing cycle collisions with cars, include raising historically low values of properties situated by the railways, the possibility of on-network ""cycling high streets"" with shops and cafés, and the ""integration of automated goods delivery networks."" For now, though, SkyCycle is a pipe dream. It's been presented to various bodies in charge of London's transport system, and will continue to be developed by Foster and its partners on the project, consultancy firm Space Syntax and London based architects Exterior Architecture, which unveiled an early plan for SkyCycle in 2012.

Between its blockbuster launch at CES in 2009 and its relaunch on LG's smart TVs today lies a history of failed ambitions and a lost history of never-released products. When LG acquired parts of webOS in February of last year, we had two questions: what exactly did LG plan to do, and why did it need webOS to do it? We finally have answers to both of those questions, and they're unsurprisingly simple and straightforward. webOS turned out to be a flexible platform that could be repurposed for the TV and — more importantly — the team behind it had a vision for how a smart TV should work.  On the eve of LG's launch, I sat down with webOS’s head of product management and design, Itai Vonshak, as well as Colin Zhao, director of product management for LG's Silicon Valley Lab. As they demoed LG's new interface to me, I was by turns intrigued, bemused, and doubtful that it was up to the task of convincing people that it would be worth buying a new TV for. Most of all, I was impressed by the clarity of vision behind the new interface. For better or worse, webOS has an opinion about how smart TVs should treat their users, and by all appearances that opinion is executed very, very well. LG is better known for pretty schizophrenic Android skins on its smartphones, so to see the company produce something this coherent was a shock. Over half of LG's TVs next year will run webOS TV, so it's a significant effort but LG isn't quite all-in yet. Zhao says that ""the war cry that we started with was to 'make TV simple again.'"" To pull it off, webOS smart TVs start with the metaphor of the line. Instead of a grid of apps, everything you want to do is arrayed horizontally. ""There's nothing simpler than understanding a line,"" Vonshak says. ""You have your past things, you have your present, and you the future.""   The ""present"" is the home screen, which appears as an overlay on top of whatever you're watching instead of kicking you off to a separate screen with a grid of apps. The line gives you a list of your favorite apps — stuff like Hulu Plus, Netflix, YouTube, and so on — along with a card that represents your last app and another called ""Today"" that can make content recommendations. The key difference between this and other smart TVs is that LG doesn't create a distinction between smart TV apps and regular TV and inputs. They're all just cards. ""We wanted unity. Everything is the same, be it your Xbox, your source, or some apps,"" says Vonshak. ""If you're watching Netflix and want to switch to see what's happening in a game, then go back to YouTube, it should be all the same thing."" In fact, LG's TVs can automatically identify new inputs and label and name them for you — so if you plug in a PS4, it will appear as a PS4 card, not just ""HDMI 2."" You navigate with LG's motion-enabled remote control and a small on-screen cursor. If you want to watch something that isn't on your home screen, you can select overflow buttons on the left or the right. The left is the ""Past,"" which gives you a history of your last apps or channels in a big list of cards. On the right are apps — and LG will have an app store to fill that list up — and as you hover over each of them, app makers can give you a big, full-screen preview to entice you to click. Of course, there are settings and even a notification system for apps to alert you about new episodes and the like, but the core of the webOS experience on LG's smart TVs boils down to that single line of cards and apps. It's very restrained, but with flourishes of animations in the transition that are fast enough to not be overbearing and provide just a little bit of whimsy. ""A lot of the challenge that comes with flat design is that it gets really boring,"" says Vonshak. ""We have a lot of tension between different parts of the design. There's strong lines, and then they move sort of like jelly, in an unexpected way."" There's one place where the whimsy might be too much — or at least too easy to compare to Microsoft Bob. It's the ""Bean Bird,"" which is part of LG's ""Cinematic Setup."" It walks users through the first-use experience: setting up time zones and Wi-Fi and the like. Flitting about on the screen, Bean Bird is meant to encourage users to actually finish their smart TV setup — too many just don't bother, Vonshak says, and there's little point in spending the extra money on a smart TV if you don't take advantage of its features. To tell the truth, I found Bean Bird a little charming — but the approach is definitely an easy target for snark, and if LG isn't judicious in using the little guy (or gal?), Bean Bird will earn a well-deserved place alongside Clippy. Watching the bird wave a surrender flag to protest your attempt to skip the Wi-Fi setup once is amusing — having to live with it all the time would be the exact opposite. Luckily, LG tells me that it's just a first-use experience. Still, once you get into actually using the webOS interface on LG's smart TVs, you'll be struck by the consistency of the experience. Vonshak says that the design was inspired by the same ""war cry"" of making TV simple. ""The strong colors, and the lines, really come from old TVs and how even the 'no signal' used to look,"" Vonshak says. ""We really found that as a great inspiration source to how to focus specifically on content, on TV itself, and what that thing is."" TV first is a good philosophy, but creating (and branding) the interface with webOS doesn't necessarily seem, well, necessary. Why webOS? Vonshak clearly still has faith in the mission of the open web. ""We really believe that the web is the right path forward and the web will win because it's the right ecosystem,"" he says. Missionary zeal aside, using HTML (and Enyo) makes very good sense for smart TVs — many of the core apps that consumers demand are already available in HTML on the web itself, so it's relatively trivial to get them working on LG's smart TVs. Earlier I called webOS on smart TVs ""a smaller ambition for a bigger screen"" and after seeing how webOS works now, that assessment still stands. LG hasn't solved any of the truly thorny problems in the living room. But executing well on a smaller ambition is still to be commended — and my initial impression is that LG may have pulled it off. webOS will never achieve the goals its original creators had set for it. And, to be honest, it won't generate massive consumer demand for LG's TVs. But what it could do is make your next smart TV a little less painful to use. Five years ago at this very show, webOS dreamt big. After seeing those dreams burn in up a conflagration of missed opportunities, even that small victory is a pleasant surprise.",0.4715082493172542,0.5284917506827458,0.17282575869863417,1254,4.4505582137161088,598,5.7826086956521738,1,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

The company, which integrates a kind of sophisticated group chat with dozens of other software services that your company may already use, has spread like wildfire in the corporate world. Before February, no one had ever heard of Slack; seemingly overnight, it was being used in every business in tech. Investors have noticed. Today Slack, which launched less than nine months ago, is announcing that it has raised $120 million, valuing it at $1.12 billion. It had previously raised $60 million. Some of Silicon Valley’s most prominent investors, including Kleiner Perkins Caufield and Byers, Google Ventures, and Andreessen Horowitz, participated in this round.  There are now more than 30,000 teams using Slack, a number that has doubled in just the past six weeks. While you can use Slack for free, 73,000 people are already paying customers, either individually or through their businesses. (The paid version lets you integrate the service with others, so you can be pinged whenever someone mentions your company on Twitter, for example, or opens a support ticket in ZenDesk.) Every month Slack's projected annual revenue is growing by $1 million. Still, even if you've used Slack, it can make you scratch your head. The fastest-growing enterprise software in history is ... a fancy chat room? Even Slack employees haven't always been sure why their product, which rose from the ashes of a failed video game, is growing so fast. They've settled on two explanations. One, the proliferation of messaging services means that your work communications are getting fragmented across an ever-growing number of places: email, Skype, Google apps and Hangouts, iMessage, and SMS, to name only a few of the most popular. Slack is a bid to bring everything back together, in a single place, with powerful search. Slack can reduce the time you spend on other productivity-related tasks  The second thing is that Slack aspires to host the entire history of your corporate communications. Give people that kind of view into their organization, founder Stewart Butterfield says, and you see them sending fewer emails, hosting fewer stand-up meetings, and organizing fewer conference calls. The pitch for Slack is that it makes you more productive by reducing the amount of time you spend on other productivity-related tasks. The big fundraising round means Slack is likely to stay independent for longer, Butterfield says, as there are few companies who will be able to afford it. (Butterfield previously co-founded Flickr, which sold to Yahoo.) It sends a message to the market that Slack is a serious business, with designs on reaching into America's biggest corporations. And it will help them hire better people, because money. Comment with a poop But what I really wanted to know from Butterfield, as a daily user of the product, was what's next on Slack's road map. Happily, Butterflied obliged. Message replies are coming, so that when you respond to someone in a Slack room, your conversations will be organized by conversation. And after receiving many requests to be able to ""favorite"" a message, Slack will soon let you comment on a message using any emoji you want — heart, thumbs up, dancing lady, or even a poop. The company also plans to increase the number of other software services it integrates with from around 65 to 250; to make Slack easier for new users to understand; and to make Slack useful for large corporations. (Slack's chat rooms tend to get very noisy after a certain number of people are using it.) ""Slack is great for 30 people,"" Butterfield says. ""But we want to make it work for companies that have 50,000 people."" First, though, we'd really like to see those emoji.",0.7005852279575507,0.29941477204244926,0.7159569402770525,639,5.0172143974960877,377,6.0026525198938989,0,2,"Apps, Business, Tech, Report",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

It focused on interconnection points, the shared equipment nodes where different networks exchange data so that it can move around the world and into your home. What it showed was that business disputes — between transit ISPs like Cogent and Level, which carry data around the world, and access ISPs like Verizon and Comcast, which carry it the last mile to your home — were having a dramatic effect on the ability of many American consumers and businesses to access the internet, reducing the flow of data to the point where even basic tasks like email would be slow or impossible. The same data means provides evidence for two opposite conclusions This was important new research that highlighted how strained the infrastructure underpinning our internet is. But depending on which side of the business dispute you sit on, the data showed two very different things. For ISP advocates, the data was clear evidence that Netflix was to blame for the degradation in service. For ISP opponents, the data was clear evidence that Comcast and Verizon were trying to punish Netflix, and harming others in the process. But as the author of the M-Lab study argues, that heated argument is causing them to miss the forest for the trees. ""What’s more important, and more troubling, is the extensive and continuing issues of capacity at many of the interconnections points which had nothing to do with Netflix,"" said Collin Anderson, a researcher at M-Lab. If the congestion had been isolated to a single interconnection between one transit and one access ISP, it might have been possible to lay the blame on Netflix or Comcast for allowing things to degrade while they bargained over the price of a direct interconnection. But the M-Lab study found that ""these issues cannot be laid at the feet of any one Access ISP, or any one Transit ISP: no Access ISP performs badly to all Transit ISPs, and no Transit ISP performs badly for all Access ISPs. Therefore, if the problem is not at one end, and not at the other, it must be in the middle around the interconnection between the two."" As the companies that move our data haggle over who should foot the bill for the exploding amount of internet traffic, our most vital modern utility can become nearly inaccessible to consumers. Our most vital communications utility can become nearly inaccessible to consumers The report found the problems follow a predictable pattern, one that not surprisingly is also at the center of Netflix's dispute with ISPs. ""Observed performance degradation was nearly always diurnal, such that performance for access ISP customers was significantly worse during peak use hours, defined by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) as the hours between 7pm and 11pm local time. This allows us to conclude that congestion and under-provisioning were causal factors in the observed degradation symptoms."" We’re increasingly relying on the internet for our evening entertainment, and that is where the real problems are cropping up. That’s Netflix, but also Hulu, YouTube, Twitch, and millions of other services. With cable channels and network broadcaster both embracing a streaming only model, this problem is going to get a lot worse, and soon. How can this problem be solved? Netflix would argue that the FCC should expand the definition of net neutrality to cover interconnection, and force the access ISPs to pay for interconnection upgrades to handle consumer’s ever larger demands for internet entertainment. The FCC has signaled it will look into interconnections, but is not likely to place them in the same bucket as net neutrality. The ISPs have argued that Netflix is just looking for a free ride, and that content companies should pay them for a direct interconnect. Netflix has done this, and the performance of its traffic has improved drastically. HBO recently signaled that it believed content companies and ISPs should share the financial burden of upgrading our infrastructure to handle the increased demand of streaming entertainment. To some degree, the marketplace works One could look at the Netflix situation and conclude that the marketplace works. After they paid up, things got better, and the cost for Netflix was less than what they paid to third party transit ISPs. The problem for Netflix is that they don’t want to be beholden to the big access ISPs, many of which also own content companies that compete with Netflix. If the cost for a direct connect were to change in the future, Netflix is worried Comcast and Verizon would have all the leverage. That brings us back to the nuclear option: the FCC using Title II to declare our broadband internet infrastructure a common carrier. That would turn Comcast and Verizon’s infrastructure into dumb pipes shared by all, allowing any company to offer itself up as an access ISP, something which worked well in England and France. And as we’ve reported, this is exactly how Verizon itself described the fiber when it was getting tax breaks and right of way to put it into the ground. Given the relative timidity of the FCC and the ISPs winning record in court, however, this seems unlikely to happen. Which means for the time being we’re left with a troubling state of affairs, one in which companies haggling over costs is threatening the performance of our most important communication and information utility. As M-Lab concluded in its report, ""ISP interconnection has a substantial impact on consumer internet performance --sometimes a severely negative impact -- and that business relationships between ISPs, and not major technical problems, are at the root of the problems we observed.""

Part of that, it appears, is pulling all of her music off of Spotify, likely in an attempt to drive sales of her new album, 1989, as well as her earlier albums. 1989 was never made available on Spotify, but as of today, all of Swift's back catalog has been pulled from the streaming service too. Spotify, naturally, is not thrilled with this development.  '1989' is likely to set some new records ""We hope she’ll change her mind and join us in building a new music economy that works for everyone,"" Spotify writes in a blog post this morning. ""We believe fans should be able to listen to music wherever and whenever they want, and that artists have an absolute right to be paid for their work and protected from piracy."" Swift and her label are in the extremely uncommon position of having the power to pull this off and likely benefit from it. As of November 1st, 1989 was on track to have the biggest first-week album sales since 2002 and set a new record for first-week sales by a female artist (Britney Spears' Oops!… I Did It Again holds the record, set in 2000), according to Billboard. Breaking those records would require 1989 to sell a bit more than 1.3 million copies before today, which it was forecasted to do. Billboard says that the sales figures won't be released until November 5th, but the existing numbers make it clear that Swift is dominating stores right now. No other album in 2014 has crossed the 1 million sales point, according to a recent report in Forbes, which just underscores how much strength Swift wields at the moment. In fact, Forbes reported that the top three albums of 2014 — Beyoncé, Pure Heroine, and the Frozen soundtrack — were all released in 2013. Spotify is trying to have some fun with Swift's absence, even putting together a playlist called ""What To Play While Taylor’s Away"" that's filled with plenty of other pop. Notably, Swift's back catalog remains on other streaming services, including Rhapsody, Rdio, and Beats Music. Those services are significantly smaller than Spotify, though, which limits what impact pulling the catalog might have. Those services still don't have access to 1989. It's not evident how long Swift or her label plan to keep her albums off of Spotify, but it's easy to imagine that they'll hang tight so long as her sales remain strong. Late last year, Spotify revealed that rights holders get between $0.006 and $0.0084 per play, which is remarkably little compared to the cut they likely get from a single sale of any given song. 1989's dominance provides the unique ability to escape all of that.

A New York City high school student, Malik had watched the twin towers implode from the top story of school, and wanted to show those behind the 9/11 attacks that “actions have consequences.”   After five years in the army — including stretches in Baghdad and Fallujah at the height of the Iraqi Civil War — Malik returned home in 2008, went to St. John’s College on the G.I. Bill, and tried to reenter civilian life.    But even with a college degree, Malik struggled to find a good job. ""Most of the offers I could get were custodial work — like janitors' jobs, "" he says. Like nearly 20 percent of veterans under 25, Malik found himself unemployed. To improve his prospects, Malik enrolled in a graduate program at NYU, interned at the State Department, and started networking with veterans employment organizations. Malik will be done with classes soon, and is looking for work. Earlier this month, he drove 200 miles from New York to downtown Boston to attend the Recovering Warrior Employment conference. There, recruiters tried to convince Malik to sign up for a different sort of army altogether — UberMILITARY. Ali Malik, an Army veteran from Queens, New York Launched this September by the international car service giant Uber, UberMILITARY aims to hire 50,000 vets — nearly a quarter of currently unemployed Iraq and Afghanistan War soldiers — in the next 18 months. (Though that number seems ambitious, the company claims to hire 50,000 drivers every month.) To aid in its effort, Uber has enlisted respected armed forces commanders such as former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Michael Mullen, and former general Stanley A. McChrystal as volunteer ambassadors to the veteran community. Gates has called the initiative an ""unprecedented effort… to ensure that tens of thousands of our nation’s military members, veterans, and spouses have access to a unique entrepreneurial opportunity."" But veterans currently driving for Uber are concerned that military commanders are sending vets like Malik into low-wage and unstable employment. As one army machine gunner turned Los Angeles Uber driver put it, ""Uber promises a good job, but in reality it’s a very precarious way to make a living. I’m looking for a new job, and there’s no way I would recommend this life to other vets."" ""UberMILITARY: Empowering Members of the Military Community,"" a promotional video by Uber  Though soldiers leave the service with leadership experience and technical skills that are supposed to prepare them for the civilian job market, for many the transition back is rough.  ""Nearly half of all service members will be unemployed at some point after leaving the military,"" says Ross Cohen, the Senior Director of Hiring our Heroes, an employment initiative sponsored by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. The organization has pledged to help find 500,000 veterans jobs by the end of 2014. Finding a job is hardest for veterans like Malik, who served in Iraq and Afghanistan and returned home in the midst of an economic downturn. These ""post-9/11"" veterans are nearly twice as likely to be unemployed as the general population. Veterans under 25 are four times more likely to be out of work. And when these veterans do enter the workforce, they are more likely to be low-paid workers: more than 1 million veterans currently work near minimum-wage jobs. The job fair Malik attended in October was sponsored by Hiring Our Heroes — the 800th such event the group has hosted since 2011. Hiring Our Heroes partners with local chambers of commerce, businesses,  and government agencies to put on veteran job fairs and bring down unemployment numbers. ""Everyone’s into supporting the troops,"" says Cohen. ""But beyond that, we want to make the business case for hiring veterans. Not because its a charity, but because they make great employees."" Conferences like these offer companies a chance to tap into a labor pool of hundreds of thousands of skilled,  hardworking, and eager candidates. And it works: at any given Hiring Our Heroes event, about 12 percent of attending veterans end up landing a job. Hiring Our Heroes hosts a wide range of employers, hiring for a spectrum of jobs — from low-paid cashier positions at Walmart to defense contract work at Lockheed Martin. The goal is employment, whatever the job may be. ""We focus on finding veterans jobs in the first place — that’s our mission,"" says Kim Morton, a staffer with Hiring Our Heroes who oversaw the Boston job conference. Outside the job fair, about a dozen sharply-dressed veterans made small talk while waiting for the doors to open. Many had traveled from out of state. Some were as young as 22; others looked close to retirement. Morton from Hiring Our Heroes moved from veteran to veteran, reviewing resumes and coaching them on interview responses. When the doors opened, dozens of the visibly jittery job-seekers wove their way through tables, shaking hands, swapping business cards, and accepting complimentary swag from would-be-employers like the Boston Fire Department, the US Postal Service, and Bank of America. A few paces from an OfficeMax table, two young, fresh-faced Uber recruiters manned a small booth. In a room full of paunchy middle-aged HR managers and neatly dressed veterans, the duo stood out. Both wore plaid shirts, and one wore a backwards baseball cap. To each veteran who sat down, they offered a complimentary Uber baseball cap, and passed over an iPad with Uber’s application on the screen. Before launching UberMILITARY, Uber ran a small case study in San Diego to measure veterans’ performance as drivers. The results spoke well for the veterans’ abilities: drivers with a military background drove more rides per hour and received higher ratings than civilian counterparts. Since the initiative was introduced, the company has dispatched recruiters to dozens of conferences, allowing Uber to solicit thousands of these above-average potential drivers. The initiative has been a tremendous success: over 1,000 military veterans signed up in the first two weeks alone. Malik walked into the job fair wearing a slim grey suit and a calm expression. His resume was polished, and came armed with answers to common interview questions. One semester away from his master's degree in security studies, he felt confident and qualified. But when he sat down with the Uber recruiters they didn’t look at his resume, or ask many questions. Instead, they launched into their pitch: Uber helps veterans become small business owners, they told him. All you need is a car. And if you don’t have one, Uber will help facilitate a loan. Malik didn’t have a car, but told the recruiters he’d ask a cousin if he could borrow his. They swapped business cards. It was all over in just a few minutes. Uber doesn’t consider its drivers employees, but ""partners"" — individual, small business owners working with, not for, the company. Becoming a small business owner, and the promise of the respectable income that comes with it, appeals to veterans. Many vets see their standard of living plummet when they leave the military. ""While serving, soldiers are accustomed to housing, health-care, and benefits,"" says Steve Dunwoody, Program Manager with Vote Vets, a 200,000-member group that advocates for employment opportunities for returning veterans. ""But when they return to civilian life, they are often forced to take low paying jobs."" At the Boston job fair, Uber recruiters gave Malik a flyer that promised $25 to $40 an hour driving an UberX. They threw in an added incentive: Uber would only take a 15 percent cut, down from the usual 25, until January 1st. ""Uber makes a concerted effort to be clear with partners on [fare] numbers,"" Arielle Goren, a spokeswoman for Uber, wrote me in an email. Estimated hourly wages can vary, she says, ""based on factors such as what kind of car a partner drives, which service he/she drives with, how far away he/she lives from the area typically served, etc."" But take-home pay can be far less than drivers are led to expect. Since Uber drivers are not technically employees, they must pay out of pocket for gas, insurance, and car expenses — costs the company doesn’t account for. Uber won’t release comprehensive statistics on driver income. But in May, the company claimed the median earnings for a full-time driver in New York was over $90,000 a year. Slate’s Alison Griswold recently did the math — factoring in expenses — and the numbers didn’t add up. One of the drivers she spoke with reported a take-home rate of $12 an hour. Griswold asked Uber to point her to a driver making the advertised median income, but the company declined. D. R. Lacy, an Army Veteran from Elmira, New York The company also changes fares and compensation rates at will, and experiments with the drivers’ share of profits. In Los Angeles, Uber’s largest market, drivers for its UberX service earned $2.40 per mile and took home 95 percent of their fares last December. Now, they take in $1.10 and 80 percent of their fares. These unpredictable working conditions don’t sit well with many drivers. There are currently attempts in Los Angeles, New York, and Seattle to unionize. Labor rights organizations have launched strikes and protests over what organizers call low-wages and precarious working conditions. In Boston and San Francisco, class action lawsuits against Uber were recently filed, alleging labor violations. Uber has tried and failed to get both suits dismissed. A fare deal From Los Angeles to Des Moines, we ran the numbers for a 15-minute, 5-mile UberX trip to find the least and most expensive estimated fares from across the country. Vets, like many Uber drivers, have been disappointed to find that the reality of driving for the company falls short of what’s advertised. Danielle Silva, who served for 10 years in the Navy, encourages veterans like Malik to think twice before enlisting in UberMILITARY. She joined Uber last May after seeing an ad that promised $30 to $40 an hour for drivers in Sacramento. Her car had recently been totaled by a drunk driver, and she planned to drive a few hours per week while her kids were in school in order to afford a new Toyota Camry. Two weeks after she started, Uber cut its rates by 20 percent in Sacramento. Now Silva has to work the late-night bar rush nearly every weekend to keep up with car payments. ""I don’t like to complain. I’d flip hamburgers to make ends meet and feed my kids,"" says Silva, a single mother of seven. ""But this is not what I was promised, and I’m worried that other veterans are going to be misled."" Uber reserves the right to fire drivers for seemingly minor infractions. Drivers with average passenger ratings that fall below 4.6 out of 5 run the risk of being ""deactivated."" One driver recently lost their job after retweeting a story that was unflattering to the company. Silva worries about deactivation. Last month, out of fear of receiving a low rating, she held her tongue while three drunk male passengers sexually harassed her. ""When I told them I had seven children, one of the guys said ‘your vagina must be wrecked,’"" she recalls. Silva was the only woman in her navy unit, and she’s comfortable confronting men who get too crude. ""But driving for Uber, this is my job, and if my rating gets too low, I can lose it,"" she says. That night, she laughed uncomfortably along with her drunk passengers. Matthew Coley, a Navy veteran from Somerville, Massachusetts The veterans at the Boston job fair I spoke with were unaware of the difficulties that some Uber drivers face. Malik left the conference interested in becoming a driver. A few days after he returned to New York, the Uber recruiter from the conference sent him a text: ""Hey Ali, did you get a chance to talk to your cousin?"" Malik then began asking around about Uber. A friend’s brother who drove for Uber warned that because of the out-of-pocket expenses, drivers have to work long hours to bring in a reasonable income. ""They didn’t mention that to me at the conference, though maybe they thought it was just common sense."" In the end, Malik’s cousin wouldn’t lend his car, and Malik told the Uber recruiters no thanks. Uber still texts him every other day, prodding him to sign up. The Boston job fair did produce some promising leads for Malik and he feels optimistic that when classes end in January, he’ll be able to land a job. But not with Uber. Though he sees how the job could appeal to other veterans. ""A lot of these guys come home and want to start working immediately,"" he says. That said, he feels veterans deserve more than what low-wage employers like Uber offer: ""Soldiers who served honorably shouldn’t have to work for low wages, they should be able to find a proper career.""   Shortly after UberMILITARY launched last month, Robert Gates and Travis Kalanick appeared on CBS This Morning as part of a publicity tour. Sitting side-by-side in front of a stone fireplace, the CEO and former secretary of defense told CBS correspondent Anna Werner about Uber’s 50,000 veteran hiring goal. Shevon Morrison, a Navy veteran from Westchester, New York Gates and Kalanick outlined how UberMILITARY was a win-win for veterans and the company alike. ""Veteran drivers have a better work ethic, and are doing more trips than the average partner,"" Kalinick said. That means more money for veterans, and for Uber. Gates added that driving is perfect for veterans who don’t want a 9-5 job and just ""want to be on their own."" That describes Matthew Hauke, a 16 year air force veteran in Milwaukee. He’s studying to be a commercial pilot, and Uber allows him to make extra cash on his own time. ""I can work around school, and that’s really helpful for my schedule,"" he says. But, like other drivers, he says his earning don’t match what Uber promised — he responded to an ad touting $30-$40 per hour, but usually brings in less than half of that.  As Uber continues to expand, UberMILITARY offers access to a steady stream of competent workers. Clearly that’s good for business. But hiring 50,000 veterans is also a good PR move for the embattled company. After a summer of negative coverage — including revelations from The Verge about Uber’s cut-throat recruitment practices — Uber is in need of an image reboot. Recruiting veterans doesn’t just make business sense, it also helps Uber position itself as a good corporate citizen. Hauke has a more cynical take of the program. UberMILITARY, he says, is ""a big show of [the company’s] patriotism to win over the public."" Josh Cohen of Hiring Our Heroes believes that for unemployed vets, Uber can be part of the solution — that any job is better than no job at all. ""Unemployment takes a psychological toll on veterans, who are used to being part of a productive team,"" he says. ""Getting a job is important to keep up self esteem.""    But Steve Dunwoody of Vote Vets insists that while employing veterans is critical, not all jobs are created equal. ""In this age of austerity, it’s already way too hard for veterans to get paid what they deserve,"" he says. He hopes veteran employment associations won’t just find soldiers jobs, but careers. ""We need to think not just about the quantity of jobs,"" warns Dunwoody, ""but the quality of jobs."" With Gates, Mullen, and McChrystal on board, UberMILITARY is on its way to reaching its 50,000 driver goal. But veteran Hauke hopes the military leaders think twice before asking vets to get behind the wheel. ""I doubt [Gates, Mullen, and McChrystal] have any idea what its like to drive for Uber.""

The plan, as described in the New York Times report, is confusing, contradictory, and not at all technical. In part that may be because it's coming second or third hand. But it also illustrates the way the FCC is tying itself in knots, trying to find purchase for some regulatory authority without overstepping its power and getting shot down again in court. The report says that the hybrid plan ""would apply utility like regulation to the wholesale portion, the exchange of data from the content provider to the Internet service provider for passage through to the end consumer."" That would mean a big victory for Reed Hastings, who has been encouraging the FCC to expand their rules to cover this exchange. Netflix had a standoff with the major US ISPs, leading to a massive degradation in the quality of its video to consumers. It solved that by paying them fees for a direct connection. The second half of the plan would cover the retail internet, the last mile network that runs between your ISP and your home. There the FCC would not attempt to use Title II to ban all fast lanes. The New York Times writes that ""Paid prioritization, where a content provider pays for a fast lane to consumers, would be restricted unless it could be proved to be just and reasonable."" The sum of the hybrid plan, according to the report, ""would allow the F.C.C. to enforce a rule against blocking of legal Internet content, to install restrictions on discrimination among Internet traffic and still provide some allowance for unique delivery arrangements for specialized services."" Remember, this is just one of four plans currently being considered. And while the report says this plan is gaining support inside the FCC, it also says that the chairman Tom Wheeler has not yet shared it with the four commissioners who would need to take it to a vote. In other words, this is a leak to the media testing the reception of a plan that Wheeler is leaning towards. While it notes that the final plan could come as soon as next month, it also says Wheeler has privately suggested it might be better to postpone until early 2015.",0.36137943388207794,0.6386205661179221,0.7809228747097068,505,4.8356435643564355,273,5.9523809523809526,0,0,"Business, Policy & Law, US & World",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

Response times have dropped, technical support tickets have shot up, and the mayor has started emergency work to fix the system. Technical support calls went up 800 percent after the system was introduced The Washington Post highlights some of the problems. Tablets placed in firetrucks and ambulances are losing their 4G connections while responding to calls, leading to difficulty tracking callers. Dispatchers, meanwhile, are deploying emergency vehicles from centers that aren't the closest to the sources of the calls. Last week, a child choked to death when responders were sent from a center about a mile away, rather than one a few blocks from the call. An investigation by the mayor's office found responders nearest to the call weren't logged in to the system. The hard figures on the system are equally dismal, the Post reports.

The report comes from the Department of Justice's Inspector General, which found that the FBI's drone program is currently limited to just 17 working drones and two pilots.

As a result of the FBI’s centralized approach to UAS,"" the report writes, ""the single team of UAS pilots has needed to travel up to thousands of miles to support FBI investigations across the United States."" According to the report, the FBI is the only Department of Justice agency with an active drone program, and has used drones in 13 investigations between September 2006 and August 2014. (The number has climbed slightly since previous reports: in July of 2013, the FBI said it had used drones a total of 10 times since 2006.) The FBI has said it will build out more comprehensive drone capabilities over the next five years, but the report found it ""had not fully developed plans to implement that goal."" The FBI has flown drones in 13 investigations since September of 2006 The report only looks at federal law enforcement, excluding military and intelligence drones deployed overseas. It also doesn't bear on any drones deployed informally by local and state law enforcement. When drones are used over US soil, they're usually flown by US Customs and Border Protection, which often provides support to the FBI and other domestic agencies. But there seems to be little documentation of when and how domestic law enforcement borrows CBP's drones, leading to some transparency concerns. ""Without better tracking and documentation,"" the report states, ""we believe that DOJ components may not be able to accurately assess their need for UAS support."" More broadly, the report suggests most Department of Justice agencies haven't embraced drones in any serious way, in part because of ongoing legal issues. The FAA requires Certificate of Waiver or Authorization before any agency operates a drone within US borders, which typically limits activities to a specific area. Agencies can obtain an emergency waiver for life-threatening circumstances, but the extra hurdles seem to have convinced most agencies to stick with manned crafts like helicopters. As Empty Wheel's Marcy Wheeler points out, the government also doesn't seem to be getting very much drone for its money. The ATF spent $600,000 on three different kinds of rotary-wing drones before deciding they were unsuitable for operational use and suspending its drone program. By contrast, the FBI spent $3 million on its drones, only half of which are currently operational.",0.5020880422677167,0.49791195773228325,0.8702614899965487,444,5.1486486486486482,267,6.1048689138576782,0,0,US & World,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

But with its 3-2 vote last month, the FCC gave EPB in Chattanooga (and another muni broadband network in Wilson, North Carolina) the go-ahead to expand their service areas. The FCC said its move was justified under Section 706 of the Telecommunications Act, which authorizes the agency to ""remove barriers to broadband investment and competition."" Both Tennessee and North Carolina passed laws that ""erect barriers to expansion of service into surrounding communities, including unserved and underserved areas.""

Obama has already urged Congress to develop a new framework for handling metadata, proposing that telecom companies hang onto the records and only hand them over when law enforcement receives a court order. That proposal was made a year ago. If Congress wants to keep allowing the government to access these records — and, yeah, it probably does — it'll have to act within the next several months.

""Any collection that does occur under those authorities should have appropriate safeguards in place to protect privacy and users' rights."" Other signatories of the letter include Wikimedia, Mozilla, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, Public Knowledge, Silent Circle, the ACLU, and CloudFlare. Congress started moving toward reform last year, but its efforts have failed so far. The House passed the USA Freedom Act, which would have ended the government's bulk metadata collection and instead had phone companies handle it, like the president requested. The Senate, however, failed to pass a companion bill. What happens in the next few months will be critical for the state of surveillance — the last time Section 215 was authorized, it was cleared for four more years. There's some concern that the Patriot Act may still allow ongoing metadata collection to continue even if the act sunsets, but the administration has said that it doesn't plan on continuing the program if that happens. The text of the letter is below: We the undersigned represent a wide range of privacy and human rights advocates, technology companies, and trade associations that hold an equally wide range of positions on the issue of surveillance reform. Many of us have differing views on exactly what reforms must be included in any bill reauthorizing USA PATRIOT Act Section 215, which currently serves as the legal basis for the National Security Agency’s bulk collection of telephone metadata and is set to expire on June 1, 2015. That said, our broad, diverse, and bipartisan coalition believes that the status quo is untenable and that it is urgent that Congress move forward with reform. Together, we agree that the following elements are essential to any legislative or Administration effort to reform our nation’s surveillance laws: • There must be a clear, strong, and effective end to bulk collection practices under the USA PATRIOT Act, including under the Section 215 records authority and the Section 214 authority regarding pen registers and trap & trace devices. Any collection that does occur under those authorities should have appropriate safeguards in place to protect privacy and users’ rights. • The bill must contain transparency and accountability mechanisms for both government and company reporting, as well as an appropriate declassification regime for Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court decisions. We believe addressing the above must be a part of any reform package, though there are other reforms that our groups and companies would welcome, and in some cases, believe are essential to any legislation. We also urge Congress to avoid adding new mandates that are controversial and could derail reform efforts. It has been nearly two years since the first news stories revealed the scope of the United States’ surveillance and bulk collection activities. Now is the time to take on meaningful legislative reforms to the nation’s surveillance programs that maintain national security while preserving privacy, transparency, and accountability.

According to visitor logs and emails obtained by The Wall Street Journal, high-ranking Google staffers, including Eric Schmidt, met with White House officials 230 times across two terms, or roughly once a week in four years. Those meetings also took place in the final weeks before the commission settled with Google, backing away from what would have been the biggest antitrust lawsuit since the Justice Department took on Microsoft in the 1990s. The documents don't show what was discussed in the late-2012 meetings, and the FTC insists it maintains independence as a regulatory agency. In fact, Jennifer Friedman, a White House spokeswoman, told the Journal that the administration is ""cognizant that it is inappropriate to discuss issues relating to regulatory enforcement."" However, the documents help illustrate how Google has become a lobbying powerhouse in recent years, such that it was able to defeat a major antitrust investigation.

Rival Comcast, by comparison, currently wields a similar kind of power in government right now, as it was the only company to outspend Google's $16.8 million in lobbying dollars last year. However, Comcast visited the Obama White House about 20 times in the last few years, paling in comparison to Mountain View's efforts. In addition, Google employees have moved over to roles in the White House in the past, with Obama naming former VP Megan Smith as his new chief technology officer last year. Scrutiny into Google's practices are likely to ramp up as the year wears on.

They couldn't find him at his office, the policeman said, and they would like him to come to the cybercrime bureau as soon as possible. Unuver is a security researcher, focusing on vulnerabilities in industrial systems, but he soon realized someone thought he was up to something more sinister: selling valuable cyberweapons to the US and Israel. It was an accusation of high treason. ""At first, I thought they needed my help in an investigation,"" Unuver says ""I answered that I had a busy week and could visit next week."" The policeman replied that if he didn't come in voluntarily in the next three days, he would be arrested. If he didn't come in voluntarily in the next three days, he would be arrested Unuver is the co-founder of SignalSec, focusing on vulnerabilities in industrial control software. He's been doing this work for eight years, disclosing some bugs publicly and selling others legally on the vulnerability market, but he'd never thought of his actions as anything close to treasonous. He was just trying to make a living by finding ways software might break. It’s how security research usually works: you’re looking for a bug nobody’s found before. (""Zero day"" just means the bug hasn’t been published before, so the researcher still has something to sell.) If the people making the software aren’t interested (and they usually aren’t), you can sell it to a third-party security company or an exploit broker. For years, the US government has been the biggest buyer of those exploits, but they’re far from the only buyer. But there’s a big difference between a zero-day vulnerability and a cyberweapon, and Unuver had stayed on the right side of the line. He’d written exploits before, sure: it’s a common part of proving a vulnerability is really workable. He’d also sold to clients in the US, simply because that's where most of the brokers and reward programs are. At his interrogation, a policeman asked him simply, ""Do you sell zero-days?"" and he worried any simple answer would land him in jail. How could he explain his business to the police without coming off like a spy? After eight months of uncertainty, Unuver recently got word that the case had been abandoned, but it's left Unuver with real concerns that his work might get him in trouble with the local government. ""It was a difficult process for me, always worrying what would happen,"" Unuver said. ""I really felt paranoid."" Researchers aren't just seen as potential criminals, but potential spies There’s a long history of security research being mistaken for criminal activity. In one particularly infamous incident in 2001, the FBI arrested a Russian researcher named Dmitri Skylarov after a public presentation that detailed security flaws in Adobe’s ebook DRM. It’s still unfortunately common for researchers to face legal retaliation after disclosing a particularly embarrassing bug. But as governments have become more publicly involved in the vulnerability trade, researchers are also exposed to espionage charges, which can leave them with much less recourse. It's not clear where the treason accusations against Unuver came from, although they may have had more to do more with Stuxnet than anything Celli has worked on. One of the most infamous pieces of state malware, Stuxnet targeted a nuclear plant in Iran using vulnerabilities in industrial control systems, and was widely attributed to the United States and Israel. Unuver insists his work has nothing to do with Stuxnet, but he does work in the same area. He joked about the impression in his Twitter bio, describing himself as a ""Siber Silah Saticisi"" or ""cyberweapon seller,"" although he's now concerned some in law enforcement may have taken the joke seriously. The same accusations have also cropped up against more established security researchers. US firms like FireEye and Crowdstrike have faced criticism for failing to detect and report US state malware, leading to speculation that the US government has actively suppressed related research. Earlier this month, Russian research firm Kaspersky was accused of having close ties to Russian intelligence agencies, potentially to the detriment of its US clients. Kaspersky vigorously denied the claim, calling it ""speculations, assumptions, and unfair conclusions based on incorrect facts."" (Kaspersky was one of the first firms to report on Red October, a strain of malware that many attribute to the Russian government.) Still, the overall message is clear: researchers aren't just seen as potential criminals, but potential spies. In the meantime, smaller researchers like Unuver are left to fend for themselves. In his case, the biggest concern wasn't international pressure but local misunderstandings about the nature of vulnerabilities and the exploit trade. What used to be simple security research can now be cast as developing cyberweapons, and the international nature of the trade makes law enforcement particularly curious. ""If there is the USA and Israel in a complaint, government officials always take it seriously,"" Unuver says, ""especially when it's a mysterious business like zero days.""",0.33241632663232,0.66758367336768,0.8449417968101228,834,5.2577937649880093,454,6.2907488986784141,0,0,"US & World, National Security, Report",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

He was only seven years old, and the sight of slasher flicks and monster movies was terrifying. He says he was “scared witless"" — and he couldn’t get enough. “I’ve been obsessed ever since,” Byles says.  Now Byles is putting that obsession to use at Supermassive Games as the creative director on the upcoming PS4-exclusive horror game Until Dawn. “It’s really frustrating watching horror [movies] and thinking ‘literally no one would do that, that was a stupid thing to do, and you deserve to die,’” says Byles. Until Dawn will give you the power to keep them alive.  The game takes your yelling at on-screen characters who are about to die because of a stupid decision, and makes it the interactive hook: here’s your chance to stop Monday morning quarterbacking all those dumb teenagers, and actually save their lives. Until Dawn is, at least on the surface, incredibly cliché. It’s a story about eight high school friends who head up to a remote cabin in the mountains for a night of debauchery. They’re mostly obnoxious stereotypes, from the blonde cheerleader to the promiscuous jock. Their vacation just so happens to take place on the anniversary of the mysterious death of two close friends. As you’d imagine, it’s not long before things get spooky; a trip to the basement to fix the electricity turns into a terrifying chase, while some fun with a Ouija board brings a haunting message. There always seems to be an axe-wielding maniac in the periphery of your vision. Early on it feels like every moment in Until Dawn is something you’ve seen elsewhere, whether it was in Evil Dead or Scream. And Byles says that’s on purpose. ""What we wanted to do was get that going as a starting point, because it’s comfortable,"" he explains. ""I don’t mean that in a not scary way, but we all know what’s going on here. And then very, very soon, after an hour or so, things should start to get a little more dangerous, and then it really turns."" I’ve played the first four chapters, and while there haven’t been any Cabin in the Woods-style shocks yet, there are definitely hints of twists and mysteries to come. ""We’ve taken a sub-genre of horror and subverted it, and we’ve tried to subvert it in a way that’s unexpected and genuinely scary,"" explains Byles. Until Dawn looks like a blockbuster game, with some of the most realistic characters I’ve ever seen, but it doesn’t really play like one. It’s more like a high-end riff on the Telltale Games formula: an interactive drama where the focus is on choices and character interaction, instead of flat out action. You’ll control each of the eight characters at various points throughout the story, and much of your time will be spent navigating dialogue choices and making quick decisions. Moments of action are relegated to relatively simple quick time events, where you have to hit a button at just the right time to jump over a ledge or slip away from a crazed killer. The game employs a ""butterfly effect"" system, where even small choices can have a huge impact. Early on I decided to rifle through someone’s bag to answer a ringing phone, and that changed the way the two characters viewed each other for the rest of the game. And unlike most choice-driven games, Until Dawn doesn’t leave you guessing as to how your actions have influenced the story; there’s an explicit menu option where you can see how choices, big or small, alter events. According to Byles, the outcome can change dramatically depending on how you play. It’s possible for everyone to make it through the night alive, or for all of them to die, or any combination of survival and death. I only played a few hours and have already lost a few people, and Byles believes this set-up will help encourage multiple playthroughs. ""I think that you’ll play it once, and hopefully you’ll have a full, compelling, and complete story,"" says Byles. ""However, if you play it again, you’ll have a different story if you make different decisions."" Until Dawn is one of the most gorgeous console games I’ve played, up there with The Order: 1886, but it also looks quite a bit different from the original version that was revealed at the Gamescom trade show in 2012. Initially in the works for the PS3, Until Dawn started out as a game designed around the PlayStation Move, Sony’s answer to Nintendo's motion-sensitive Wii remote. It was played from a first-person perspective, with gameplay that revolved around using a flashlight to find your way around, and Byles describes the early version as ""much more tongue-in-cheek"" than the relatively serious game I played. Fans really seemed to be into the concept, and the response showed Supermassive that the audience for the game was potentially much bigger than they originally thought. ""We realized that this is a stronger title than just a Move title,"" says Byles. The PS4 game is played with a regular Dualshock controller, though there are still some motion controls thrown in; the controller’s touchpad can be used to flip through pages of a book or swipe to unlock a phone, and  at one point you have to keep perfectly still so you don’t scare off a squirrel. The studio also hired writers Larry Fessenden and Graham Reznick to revamp the script, and enlisted actors like Heroes and Nashville star Hayden Panettiere to give it some added emotional weight. What started out as a game to show off a new controller slowly turned into something much bigger. Until Dawn is Supermassive’s first big original game — its previous releases were primarily ports for existing franchises like LittleBigPlanet and Killzone — and it’s one that’s grown organically. If the studio had originally pitched a big-budget teen horror game, there’s a good chance it wouldn’t have happened. For Byles, who has worked in the games industry for more than a decade after years spent in theater and animation, it’s a chance to remember what it was like to be a little boy, scared to death while watching movies with his big sister. ""I’ve been desperate to do this from the day I entered [the games industry],"" he says.

It’s almost obligatory to describe Armada as a follow-up, because that’s what it is in every sense: it has the same earnest nostalgia for the ‘80s and the same young protagonist whose knowledge thereof unlocks an epic quest. It takes place in a different universe, technically, but in truth it’s in the exact same world: the world of fandom. The book’s main character is Zack Lightman, a teenager who is obsessed with the ‘80s because of an absent father who left him with boxes filled with movies and games. After fighting with the school bully, talking to his mom about his future, and digging through his father’s movie-fueled conspiracy theories, the real action begins. Because of his skills at a video game, he’s recruited by the Earth Defense Alliance (the same entity in Armada, the game) into an actual fight against aliens. The video game is real, it turns out, and humanity has been engaged in a secret battle and has been using video games and movies to prepare the populace for all-out war. It’s the plot of Ender’s Game and The Last Starfighter on purpose: those pieces of culture, you see, were seeded by a secret government program to subliminally prepare us for the coming alien onslaught. Straightforward, open prose that disarms you with its innocence That setup could lead to a set of clever and incisive commentaries on pop culture and our obsessions with it. But no, there’s only room for fandom here, even if the things Zack is obsessed with were secretly government programs designed to turn him into an alien-killing machine. And every plot twist, such as it is, is telegraphed so strongly that you mostly just find yourself along for the ride, waiting for revelations that you can see coming a mile away. To be fair, it’s a pretty fun ride. Cline writes with a kind of straightforward, open prose that disarms you with its innocence. And to be fairer still, if you think of Armada as strictly a Young Adult kind of novel, you can almost forgive the lack of depth you’ll find in most characters, although unfortunately those two-dimensional stereotypes tend to hew to geek culture, too. Zack’s love interest, Alexis Larkin, is every punk rock manic pixie dream girl trope rolled up into one combat-booted, R2-D2-flask-drinking, walking piece of wish fulfillment. The only saving grace is that the lack of depth is reflected by virtually every other character in the book. Everybody is only one ""hey buddy, are we cool?"" conversation away from clean and simple resolutions. There are plenty of YA novels that aren’t afraid to present moral complexity at the heart of their main characters — Armada isn’t one of them. In Ready Player One, a wealthy genius creates virtual reality worlds about his personal obsessions, ‘70s and ‘80s geek culture, in a massive contest that’s designed to impart a sense of culture and humanity on the people who live in the future. In order to play in his virtual reality world, they need to bone up on TV shows, old arcade games, and increasingly obscure movies. It's like Willy Wonka made you prove you knew the chemical composition of nougat before he let you into the chocolate factory Armada runs through the same game plan, only the wealthy genius is Cline himself, and the people who have to learn about ‘80s culture are his readers. Cline’s mission to get America’s youth to care as much about Iron Eagle as he does is starting to feel like a slog. It’s as though Willy Wonka made you prove you knew the chemical composition of nougat before he let you into the chocolate factory. More than anything else, Armada reads like fan fiction, but with a wider set of source material than just one book or movie. There’s a simple joy in fandom that’s hard to be cynical about, and Armada is so far from anything resembling cynicism that it can be refreshing. The 12-year-old version of me would have really loved this novel. But the 12-year-old version of me existed 25 years ago, in the American-centric suburban white geek culture that infuses every corner of Armada.

""Honeymoon"" is a torturously slow bit of blue-hued soul that languishes in the kind of patient sorrow Lana Del Rey does best. And, at 6 minutes long, there's plenty of room for her to stretch out in.  The album is out in September Compared to LDR's debut album, Born to Die, last year's Ultraviolence felt matured in a way that made its bruised melancholy hurt just a little bit more. Its tracks were meandering, dark, and confident enough to escape some of the structured melody of Born to Die. ""Honeymoon,"" too, does this. The chorus plays almost like a sigh, layering words into a light timbre. Vocally, LDR stays largely in the low end, which is where she's always sounded most comfortable, and just the smallest bit threatening. Sweeping strings and stuttering snares float through the background of the song, but, like much of Lana Del Rey's work, the core of its appeal is in her voice, which has almost created a character — lonely, moody, possibly Midwestern — on its own.

The service will be free during the beta; representatives tell us no business model has been finalized for after the service leaves beta, which will last a ""period of weeks to a minimum."" Xfinity Games will launch with 23 titles. The selection is being designed with families and casual gamers in mind. Controls will be handled via smartphone and tablet (no word on how, exactly, customers would pair the devices). ""We create the content that fulfills the service,"" said Katrina Strafford, EA's VP of marketing, who likened the partnership to being a content provider like HBO.

Origin ID required for saving progress Though very clearly targeting a more casual audience — I don't think a core gaming audience would be eager to play a three-year-old FIFA title — Xfinity Games is part of a wider trend of companies experimenting with cloud-based game streaming, including PlayStation Now (borne out of Sony's acquisition of Gaikai) and NVIDIA Grid, which is currently in its ""free to try"" stage for Shield customers until the end of the month. The goal is to make playing games ""as easy as switching between channels,"" according to Comcast's executive director of product Preston Smalley. The Xfinity Games service will exist within the X1 platform, which recently added live-streaming and apps like Pandora. Comcast says that you will need a high-speed data connection but wouldn't provide specifics on upload / download speed requirements. ""If you sign up, you won't need to upgrade."" Game streaming will be treated like any other internet traffic, and as such will count toward any customer with monthly data caps. Just 5 million Comcast customers currently have X1 Though Smalley tells us X1 customer feedback is strong (""you name the metric, it's going well""), just 5 million of the company's over 22 million video customers have X1. In the last quarterly report, Comcast promised to accelerate deployment — according to Smalley, 15,000 to 20,000 new installations are happening daily. At that rate, between 8 and 10 million new X1 customers will be added by the end of 2016, when Comcast promises a majority of its customers will have X1. Technically 13–15 million is a majority, but at less than 70 percent of the customer base, it still feels light. Who knows, maybe 4K cable boxes will speed up the process?

As the leak had suggested, the SmartBand 2's biggest upgrade is a heart rate monitor, which will augment the device's ability to track users' fitness. Like the original SmartBand, it also functions as a sort of triage system for notifications, connecting to users' Android and iOS smartphones and vibrating to let them know about incoming calls, texts, and emails. Unlike the SmartBand Talk with its 1.4-inch e-paper display, the SmartBand 2 has no screen and instead relies on vibrations and LEDs to get its messages across. It also functions as a music remote and has a smart alarm clock feature that monitors users' sleep and wakes them with vibrations at the best point in their sleep cycle. Sony says the device is also waterproof and offers two days of battery life from an hour of charging.   As a gadget that monitors both notifications and activity, the SmartBand 2 can be a bit tricky to categorize. Sony, however, presents it as a ""lifelogger"" — intending that the device is paired with the company's Lifelog app to offer ""insights about [users'] fitness, well-being, and stress levels."" The app doesn't offer anything radically new in the way of tracking, but bundles together fitness data (e.g. number of steps taken and stairs climbed) with information about when the user took pictures, played games, or listened to music on their phones or other devices. Sony now offers a number of SmartWear products designed to work with the Lifelog app, including the SmartWatch, SmartBand, and SmartBand Talk.

One mile above sea level in a landlocked state, months of heavy snow leave the town unable to grow much of its own produce, forcing it to import fresh fruit and vegetables from other states or other countries. But the creators of a new initiative called Vertical Harvest — a multi-story greenhouse built on the side of a parking lot — hope that one of the world's few vertical farms can help feed the town with tomatoes, herbs, and microgreens.   Vertical Harvest places plants on carousels that keep them moving the length of the greenhouse, giving them equal time in natural light, and also allowing workers to pick and transfer the crops. Using hydroponics, Vertical Harvest will be capable of producing over 37,000 pounds of greens, 4,400 pounds of herbs, and 44,000 pounds of tomatoes. Its founders say that Vertical Harvest's 30 foot by 150 foot plot of land offers the same growing areas as 23 acres of traditional farmland, and has a fraction of the environmental impact, using 90 percent less water and 100 percent fewer pesticides than traditional farming.  Funded partially through a successful Kickstarter campaign and set up in collaboration with Jackson Hole's town authorities, the initiative's founders, Nona Yehia and Penny McBride, say that although greenhouses use a lot of energy, it's still a net gain over importing tomatoes and other vegetables from out of state. The two have also offered jobs at the vertical farm to people with developmental disabilities, who will be planting and harvesting the crops when Vertical Harvest opens this year.

The virus enters and infects cells thanks to channels in the cell’s membrane, according to a study published in Science today — and a molecule found in an Asian herb appears to be able to stop that process in mice. half of the mice survived a lethal dose of Ebola About 23,600 people have been infected with Ebola since the beginning of the outbreak in West Africa, according to the World Health Organization. Of those, 9,500 have died. To curb the outbreak, researchers have been trying to come up with a vaccine — the most likely solution, given the number of Ebola vaccine trials currently underway. But some researchers have opted to take the road less traveled: they’re trying to understand how Ebola infects the cell, so they can protect people who have been exposed. Today's study provides the groundwork for that approach. In the study, researchers stained cells with a dye to show their anatomy. Then they observed the Ebola virus enter cells using powerful microscopes. They found that a calcium channel called ""two-pore channel 2"" (TPC2) controls the final stages of Ebola virus entry into the cells. In short, the channel is involved in the release of the virus's genome into the cell — the final step before viral replication. ""We identified a new step in Ebola virus infection process,"" says Robert Davey, a virologist at the Texas Biomedical Research Institute and a co-author of the study.  Blocking this step might therefore result in the virus being destroyed — a side effect that could be exploited to treat people infected with Ebola. To test this idea, Davey and his team searched for molecules that could block TPC activity. They identified a few, but one drug stood out: tetrandrine, a drug derived from an Asian herb. People in China — the only country where it's approved — use tetrandrine to lower blood pressure in humans. When the drug was given to mice who had been given a lethal dose of Ebola the day before, half of the mice survived. ""Tetrandrine was the most potent and caused the least side effects,"" Davey says. Trapping the Ebola virus so the cell can destroy it Figuring out that Ebola needs TPC2 to enter cells ""is exciting,"" says Darryl Falzarano, a virologist at the University of Saskatchewan who didn’t participate in the study. ""The data supporting the requirement for TPC2 is really solid,"" he says. And the mouse experiment shows that this technique could work; blocking TPC activity with tetrandrine appears to trap the Ebola virus in the membrane compartment it’s using to enter the cell. Because it can’t get out to replicate, it’s ""destroyed by the cell,"" Davey says. ""This stops infection."" Unfortunately, tetrandrine isn't an ideal drug candidate; it's banned for human use in most countries. Plus, treating a human with a dose equivalent to the one given to the mice could be toxic, according to Falzarano. Moreover, the effectiveness of the drug was reduced in mice when the treatment was delayed by a single day. tetrandrine is banned for human use in most countries Despite these issues, the findings relating to how Ebola enters cells are significant, Davey says. Other research groups have been able to increase survival in mice infected with Ebola using known drugs, but they weren’t able to explain the mechanism behind the survival effect. Understanding the mechanism is a crucial step if you want to make better drugs and gain FDA approval, he says. These findings have been a long time coming. In 2008, Davey and his team published a study that showed that switching off calcium-sensing proteins stopped Ebola virus infection. ""We thought it must be something to do with calcium channels, but we did not know which ones,"" Davey told The Verge. It wasn’t until 2012 that the researchers realized that TPC proteins were the root cause. And it took an additional two years to understand that TPC proteins were controlling the way the virus moves into cells. Now that Davey and his team have figured out that tetrandrine can block Ebola infection in mice, the next step will be to test the drug on monkeys. ""We are testing the treatment to make sure it is safe in animals and are also looking to see if related compounds have lower side effects."" These tests will take quite some time to complete. ""This does not mean we have a miracle treatment."" ""This does not mean we have a miracle treatment,"" Falzarano says. Blocking TPC activity could form the basis of future drug interventions, but any drug that acts that way would have to be very efficient, he says — so much so ""that I think it is unlikely to be successful on its own."" Moreover, tetrandrine isn’t an approved drug, so the finding ""will have no effect of the ongoing outbreak,"" he says. We may one day have a drug that can be used to block infection in people who have been exposed to the virus, but that probably won’t happen soon. ""I still think that implementing one of the vaccine platforms will have the most significant public health impact,"" Falzarano says.",0.33974881366761545,0.6602511863323846,0.8419847257346631,888,4.8626126126126126,422,6.0687203791469191,0,0,"Science, Report",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Although in developed nations ketamine is known primarily as a party drug, in lower income countries it's one of the most widely used anesthetics available, and is particularly notable for its use during caesarean sections. ketamine is easy to administer for non-skilled health workers Because ketamine is injectable, it's far easier to administer and transport than gas anesthetics, making it indispensable for doctors carrying out life-threatening surgeries in rural areas. It's also safer than other anesthetics as it induces a dissociative state but allows patients to retain their gag and cough reflexes. This is essential for saving lives during caesarean sections, as women who lose these reflexes due to heavy sedation can die when acid accumulating in their stomach floods their lungs. The proposal to limit access to ketamine has been submitted by China and will be discussed by the UN’s Commission on Narcotic Drugs (CND) next month. China is suggesting that ketamine become a Schedule I drug — the same category as psychedelics such as LSD and more commonly abused substances like cocaine. This means that it would be prohibited from use except for ""very limited medical purposes"" and could only be administered by ""persons directly under the control of the government."" Countries would also have to submit import quotas for the drug each year in advance. ""A David and Goliath struggle."" Campaigners arguing against the proposal say the effect of these restrictions would be devastating for lower income countries. Richard Laing, a professor of international health at Boston University’s school of public health, told The Guardian that the proposal was a ""David and Goliath struggle between people interested in access to an essential medicine for women and victims of trauma in poor countries and the drug control establishment in rich countries."" China is submitting the proposal because it is worried about abuse of the drug by its citizens. A UN report from May last year noted that ketamine is ""more widely misused in East and South-East Asia than in the Americas and Europe,"" with ketamine-induced seizures in China and Hong Kong making up 60 percent of the reported global share. China is also major exporter of ketamine and its proposal has the backing of a number of countries including Russia. The Un has repeatedly said that Ketamine access should not be restricted However, for a drug to be placed under international control, the decision would need the approval of the World Health Organization's (WHO) Expert Committee on Drugs and Dependence (ECDD). The ECDD reviewed ketamine's status in both 2014 and in 2006, and in both cases recommended against making the drug Schedule I. The panel of experts noted that abuse of the drug was not widespread and had limited evidence of harm (aside from lower urinary tract problems). There's also hope that variations of the drug could provide effective treatment of depression. For some health experts, attempts to restrict access to ketamine are simply another example of how the international system of drug control has fueled global health inequality, specifically the access to effective and affordable pain relief. Studies show that even on a per capita basis, poorer countries have far less access to pain relief, and restricting ketamine would only exacerbate this problem. Even worse, it would disproportionately affect women and unborn children in poorer countries.",0.32434768572388195,0.675652314276118,0.8365438700616549,577,5.2651646447140381,320,6.3937499999999998,0,0,"Policy & Law, Science, US & World",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The woman, Antonia Cerda, died in November. But what seemed like an isolated incident is quickly turning into a much bigger scandal. The type of medical scope that spread the superbug in California has been implicated in a number of other deaths in others states, reports Bloomberg. the superbug can kill up to 50 percent of infected patients Seven patients have been infected with an antibiotic-resistant superbug called ""CRE""  from contaminated medical scopes made by Olympus, according to UCLA. So far, two people have died, and another 179 may have been exposed. The superbug can kill up to 50 percent of infected patients. The same type of scope — which is used to view the gastrointestinal tract for diseases of the bile duct, pancreas, and liver, and is called a duodenoscope — was implicated in an outbreak that infected patients at two hospitals in Florida in 2008 and 2009, according to Bloomberg. During that outbreak, 70 patents were infected, 15 of whom died. The outbreak was reported to the FDA, device manufacturers, and the CDC, according to the Florida Department of Health. But the FDA says that it doesn’t have a record of the outbreak in Florida, or of the device implicated in the outbreak. ""We are aware, via a search of medical literature, of cases of CRE at two hospitals in the Tampa area during that time,"" FDA spokeswoman Leslie Wooldridge told Bloomberg in an email.  the FDA doesn’t have a record of the 2008 outbreak A second outbreak took place in Seattle in 2012. At the time, 32 patents were infected; 11 of those patients died. At least three other outbreaks — in Philadelphia, Chicago, and Pittsburgh — have taken place since 2013, reports Al Jazeera America. CRE stands for ""carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae."" A CRE infection is very difficult to treat because it's highly resistant to antibiotics. Healthy people don't tend to become infected by these bacteria. They mostly infect people with compromised immune systems — like people in hospitals. Last week, the FDA issued a letter designed to warn health professionals that the scope’s design ""may impede effective cleaning."" But health professionals have known for decades that these scopes can transmit bacteria between patients, reports Fox. Now that superbugs are involved, the problem appears to be more urgent — and more deadly. The scope’s design ""may impede effective cleaning.""  Cerda's family isn't the only affected party going after Olympus. A second patient — an 18-year-old man who is still hospitalized at UCLA — is suing the manufacturer for negligence, misrepresentation, and fraud. Olympus has not yet commented on the lawsuits, but it gave America Tonight the following statement: ""While all endoscopes, including duodenoscopes, require thorough reprocessing after patient use in order to be safe, the Olympus TJF-Q180V requires careful attention to cleaning and reprocessing steps, including meticulous manual cleaning, to ensure effective reprocessing."" These scopes are mostly made by Olympus, Pentax, and Fujifilm. They  are used in approximately 500,000 medical procedures each year.

""the mission we are asking teams to accomplish is extremely difficult and unprecedented"" ""We know the mission we are asking teams to accomplish is extremely difficult and unprecedented, not only from a technological standpoint, but also in terms of the financial considerations,"" XPRIZE president Robert Weiss said in the release. ""It is for this reason that we have decided to extend the competition timeline."" To win the $20 million grand prize, the winning team must be the first to land a spacecraft on the Moon — but that's not all. They must also drive it 500 meters on, above, or below the lunar surface, and transmit HDTV ""Mooncasts"" back to Earth. The competing teams, which are from all over the world, must accomplish this with no more than 10 percent in government funding. The ambitious contest was originally announced in 2007 and is a spiritual successor of sorts to the XPRIZE Foundation's first competition — the Ansari XPRIZE. That competition was won by a team that created SpaceShip One, the ship that eventually became Virgin Galactic's SpaceShip Two. Only one spacecraft has made a controlled landing on the Moon since 1976 — China's Chang'e-3 probe in 2013. There are 18 registered teams at the moment, though only a handful of them have loose launch plans. The XPRIZE deadline was already delayed once before; the original 2012 goal was pushed to 2015 due to slow progress among the competing teams. Despite the new delay, the company did announce some milestone prizes, and more will be announced at an event in January of 2015.

The new invention, called the Hyperloop, would ferry passengers between Los Angeles and San Francisco in less than 30 minutes, thanks to an ultralight design and an innovative combination of air blades and a semi-evacuated tube. It was a world-changer, assuming anyone succeeded in actually building it. Then...we waited. For more than a year, nothing happened. Musk made the plans public and referred to preliminary tests in Texas, but it's unclear if he ever followed through on building a test model. Instead, he made the plans public, promising not to enforce his trademark on the idea and hoping others would pick up the idea and run with it. Now, one of the first projects is finally finding its legs. First formed last September, Hyperloop Transportation Technologies, Inc. has announced a new stage of the project, together with new research into the finance and engineering of the system set to arrive later this week. The company works on an unusual model, drawing from a network of over a hundred professionals with experience from Boeing, Tesla, and SpaceX. Under the JumpStartFund model, each employee is compensated through a share of the company's eventual profits. If the system works, the profits will be shared far more broadly than a traditional corporation — but until that time, they're all volunteers. The group is still a long way from actually producing a working Hyperloop, but it's already made serious progress on how an eventual system might look. The group envisions three classes — economy, business and freight — with dozens of possible routes across the US. The group is also looking into improvements on the initial design. ""In the initial white paper, air has the advantage that it's cheap, but it also has problems with control,"" says CEO Dirk Ahlborn. If another medium performs better in testing, it will be easy to switch. After initial financial projections, the cost for the trans-California route is expected to fall between $7 and $16 billion — a good deal higher than Musk's initial estimate of $6 billion, but still a bargain compared to existing rail projects. ""The biggest thing for me is the price,"" says Ahlborn. ""We know it's not going to cost $50 billion — we know we're in a range that works.""

According to Reuters, the company is working on a version of Android specifically designed to serve as a car's central infotainment system. Right now, Android Auto is a layer that runs on top of existing in-car platforms from automakers — much like Apple's CarPlay. But Reuters makes it sound like Google ultimately wants to replace systems like Ford Sync and BMW iDrive rather than exist alongside them. This direct integration would put Google's services like Maps at the forefront of crucial tasks like navigation. And since more cars are being outfitted with Wi-Fi and cellular radios, it's not hard to imagine checking Gmail or your Hangouts messages on the road. With Android Auto as it exists now, drivers can still hop between Google's software and the built-in apps that come from car manufacturers. As Reuters notes, convincing the major automakers to go solely with Google for their in-car needs is likely going to be a tough argument. The current version of Android Auto also requires a smartphone to be plugged in — since that's really what powers Google's current approach. This new variant of Android, which would presumably be loaded onto cars leaving the factory, will debut alongside Android M in about a year, according to Reuters. Even the current incarnation of Android Auto is off to a slow rollout — again, just like CarPlay. Google's got a very long list of auto manufacturers who've promised to back the platform, but we won't start seeing support until sometime next year.",0.3509784785979071,0.6490215214020929,0.17186191005518847,271,4.9963099630996313,184,5.5815217391304346,0,0,"Google, Tech, Transportation",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

Although LG is expected to retain some form of webOS’ interface, exactly what that will mean on a television instead of a phone or tablet is still a mystery. If LG has any luck at all, it will be more successful than the last consumer webOS products. It's been over two years since HP’s TouchPad and the Pre 3 were released and then discontinued in a surprise decision from then-CEO Léo Apotheker. In fact, most people within HP were blindsided when executives decided to stop hardware production and left the software team twisting in the winds of uncertainty. Apotheker's decision ultimately led to the open sourcing of some parts of webOS and the sale of the rest to LG under current CEO Meg Whitman. But back in 2011, before and after Apotheker's fateful decision, Palm had been actively working on both new hardware and new software. The Verge has obtained documents describing Palm's plans and even a design prototype of a new smartphone. They tell a story of a company struggling to innovate in the face of daunting competition and perishingly few resources. They also show that, even at the end, Palm’s ambition outstretched its ability. This is the webOS that never was. On February 9th, 2011, Palm's Jon Rubinstein took to the stage to unveil the first major products to come out of the division since the HP sale. The Pre 3 and Veer phones weren't much better than the Pre phones that came before them, but the TouchPad showed promise, at least on the software side. Unbeknownst to Rubinstein and his staff, the event — known internally as ""Embark"" — would be the high point of Palm's brief tenure at HP. But the good vibes from the event didn't last long. Apple announced the iPad 2 on March 2nd, less than one month later and well before Palm's TouchPad was released. Though webOS on the TouchPad had some clever features and an elegant software design, the TouchPad itself was a hulking, plastic monster. It was for all intents and purposes a glossy black look-alike of the original iPad. Apple's iPad 2 was as much of a revelation as the original iPad. It was radically thinner, lighter, and faster than what had come before and it immediately made the TouchPad — not to mention competing Android tablets — look stale by comparison. Apple released the iPad 2 to consumers just over a week after it was announced, while the TouchPad wasn't released until July. If the documents we obtained detailing HP's product plans are any indication, the iPad 2 sent the company into a panic. In a document distributed in late March, HP admitted that the iPad 2 had ""changed the competitive trajectory"" and foresaw rapid responses from Samsung — which had shaved over 2mm from its Galaxy Tab tablet in response to the iPad 2. HP had also gotten pushback from the likes of AT&T, which wasn't happy with the TouchPad's ""thickness, weight, [and industrial design]."" HP created a plan to refresh the TouchPad with the ""Sapphire"" (the TouchPad's codename was Topaz, and the Sapphire was also referred to as the ""Topaz2""), with the unrealistic goal of developing it in ""record time"" and releasing it in late 2011. At the same time, it was working on another tablet that would feature a high resolution screen to be released in the latter half of 2012. The former would have brought the company to some kind of parity with Apple (albeit a year late), while the latter would have arrived a few months after Apple introduced a Retina display iPad. It also planned to work on a successor to the ""Opal,"" the 7-inch tablet that was nearly released as the TouchPad Go before it was canceled. HP's tablet plans looked reactionary in both specs and design. It was caught flat-footed by Apple and was rushing to make its traditional tablets competitive. It’s not clear how far along HP got with any of these plans, but it seems unlikely that any of them would have made their ship-date targets. HP was also painfully aware that though the Palm faithful still liked hardware keyboards and the slide-out design of the Pre (and even the Veer), the rest of the world was moving to touchscreen-only phones. It had developed a version of the Pre 3 that had no physical keyboard, codenamed ""WindsorNot."" The WindsorNot was meant for AT&T but didn’t have LTE, and it was delayed past the point when AT&T would require all smartphones to have LTE. However, HP was also working on a significantly more advanced phone, codenamed ""Mako."" The Verge obtained a design prototype of the device that reveals a new design direction eschewing the soft, nature-inspired pebble look of the Pre for something much more angular. It was to have a glass front and back, wireless charging, LTE, and a high-resolution screen. By today's standards, the Mako looks thick and this particular prototype isn't exactly beautiful — but it is at least unique and presumably the final hardware would have been fairly elegant, especially compared to other devices in late 2011 and early 2012. In terms of specs, we are told that it was to be about on par with the HTC One X, and had things gone according to plan it would have possibly been released in early 2012, beating the One X to market. Had Palm managed to pull it off, the Mako would have been one of the first Palm devices in a long time to feature competitive performance — albeit in a form that was still thicker than other devices at the time. However, development on the Mako never made it very far, and to our knowledge no working models ever got off the development board, much less into real-world testing. But HP wasn't just working on ""traditional tablets"" like the Topaz2 and Opal and ""traditional"" phones like the Mako: it was also in the process of developing a hybrid device that would combine a tablet with a keyboard and a new sliding hinge. It would have been a precursor to the many hybrid Windows 8 devices on the market today. HP codenamed it ""Twain."" Development on Twain was already underway by March, 2011, when Apple’s iPad 2 blindsided HP. The knock on iOS on the iPad was always that it wasn't great at being ""productive,"" and HP intended to take that perceived weakness head on. In an early presentation outlining Twain's features, HP asked ""Are traditional notebooks a thing of the past?"" and answered ""If they are, Twain is the notebook of the future."" Twain's core design involved a touchscreen that could slide out and then up to reveal a keyboard underneath. The proposed hardware specs were up to date, but most importantly it was to feature the stark new industrial design direction meant for all future Palm products. HP wanted to add a magnetic charger, NFC, HDMI-out, and a set of software features designed to make the Twain appeal to enterprise and productivity customers. HP also planned on extending the ""Touch to share"" feature it had introduced on the original TouchPad so that you could swipe data from the Twain to another webOS device using ""ultrasonic transmission to sense the location of fellow webOS devices."" While most of HP's tablet and phone plans (save the Twain) were reactionary and predictable, the software team was working on some truly innovative designs. Though Eel added more power to the core interface of webOS (along with, it must be said, more complexity), it also did something more. Years before Apple went ""flat"" with its design for iOS 7 and even well before Android cleaned itself up, the Vonshak and visual design director Liron Damir were finalizing a new software design language it called ""Mochi."" In fact, Palm had been working on two different design languages for Eel. One was significantly harsher and more industrial-looking, the better to match the hard lines of products like Twain and Mako. However, when Apotheker made the decision to scuttle webOS hardware, the team focused its efforts on the softer Mochi design — which was more in fitting with Palm's ethos. As HP's management struggled to decide what to do with webOS, Palm's software team moved forward on redesigning the entire OS with a flatter, cleaner look. Soft white backgrounds were mixed with bold colors. At one point, the team had proposed creating subtle animations for the panels, having them ""breathe"" as though they were pieces of paper, so you could tell that they could be moved around more easily. In lieu of back buttons, panels had a small curved tab at the bottom that indicated they could be grabbed and resized. Mochi wasn't completely flat in the vein of Windows Phone, or even what we'd eventually see with iOS 7. There were still gradients and curves — but they were mixed with big typography and an elegant use of white space to help make data easier to parse. Fonts were improved and Eel made heavy use of circles — an homage to the Palm logo of old. Obviously, none of these webOS dreams came to pass — nor did other ideas like a stylus that could read color in the real world and then use it to draw on a tablet. Even if HP had not decided to give up on webOS hardware and all but abandon webOS software, the chances that any of these products would have seen the market and gained any sort of real success seems awfully small. Both Palm and HP had difficulties shipping on time and competing successfully even in the best of circumstances — and it was clear that HP didn't think it would be able to take on the challenges that would have lain ahead for webOS. The competitive landscape for tablets and phones wasn't quite as locked down in late 2011 and early 2012 as it is now — back then, it still seemed like there might be space for at least four major players in the market. However, since then we've seen BlackBerry implode almost as spectacularly as Palm, and a host of other companies have failed to make a dent. Microsoft may have established itself in third place behind iOS and Android — but with the benefit of hindsight it seems obvious now that there wouldn't have been much space for webOS to hang on. Though it's painful to Palm fans to have to admit it (especially when looking at the clean lines on Mochi), the marketplace probably would have doomed these webOS products if HP hadn't done it first. We'll never be able to say definitively that HP made the right call in killing off webOS and selling what was left for LG to put on televisions. But now, in 2014, LG's forthcoming TV will be yet another new beginning for webOS — a smaller ambition for a bigger screen.

The company now expects to ship 41 million smartphones in its current fiscal year — that's down from a forecast of 43 million units in July, which was itself a cut from the 50 million projected in April. Although Sony's mobile division brought in ¥308.4 billion ($2.83 billion) in revenue from July to September, around a 1.2 percent increase on a year ago, the company is writing down ¥176 billion yen of the business' value. Kunimasa Suzuki, the president and CEO of Sony Mobile since April 2012, has been replaced by Hiroki Totoki, until now a senior VP in charge of corporate planning. Suzuki will become executive VP at Sony Entertainment and move to a group executive role at the wider corporation as of November 16th.   Outgoing Sony mobile chief Kunimasa Suzuki Overall, Sony reported a net loss of ¥136 billion ($1.25 billion) off ¥1.9 trillion ($17.4 billion) revenue in its fiscal Q2, with an operating loss of ¥85.6 billion ($785 million); all of this means the company lost 593.9 percent more money than in Q2 2013. The PlayStation 4 made a strong contribution to Sony's 7.2 percent year-on-year increase in sales with the game division bringing in 83.2 percent more revenue than this time last year, and the weakening yen helped the company's bottom line because most of its sales are outside Japan. Sony puts the swing to operating loss largely down to the mobile division's ¥176 billion impairment charge, which it last month warned investors to expect after a reassessment of the current smartphone strategy. Sony's camera sensors are its real mobile success Sony has received some critical acclaim for its smartphones, but has struggled to make inroads in the critical US market. The current flagship Xperia Z3, for example, is only available on fourth-placed T-Mobile and, although number 1 carrier Verizon has recently agreed to sell a model called the Z3v, it's a watered-down version of the Z3 with cheaper hardware design. While Sony's own phones might not be doing well, the company does have significant presence in the mobile industry in a way most users might not expect: its camera sensors, used by Apple and other leading manufacturers. Sony's ""devices"" division, which handles component sales, saw revenue increase 23.1 percent and operating profit increase 148.7 percent year-on-year due to an increased demand for image sensors and camera modules in mobile products.

Starting today, Instagram is allowing advertisers to start running 15-second video ads that'll appear in your feed the same way that sponsored image posts have for almost a year now, according to Adweek. Instagram has reportedly been testing the videos for several months, so it's possible that you've already seen one, but video ads are widely launching today, beginning with spots from Disney, Banana Republic, Activision, Lancome, and the CW network.  The ads look really incongruous Disney is promoting Big Hero 6 and Activision is promoting Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare, both of which come out next week. The odd thing is that, unlike the photo ads for which Instagram has put so much effort into ensuring a coherent style with the type of images you would normally see in a feed, the video ads are basically just commercials. There's nothing Instagramy about them, and it's hard to imagine that they'll fit in. Banana Republic is the only one that gets close, running a silent time-lapse video of someone sketching a model. Even with their incongruity, video ads are likely to play a major role in Instagram's continued quest to make money under Facebook. Adweek reports that Instagram's tools for advertisers are fairly basic, only allowing them to target video spots based on users' age, gender, and country. Still, it's starting with some big names — all of which seem pretty excited about being able to run video on Instagram. You can watch the ads for four of the companies over at Adweek.

In the last 10 months, Twitter has lost: its chief operating officer, its chief financial officer, its head of product, its head of news, its head of engineering, and (just this week) one of his deputies. Then today came another twist: the company promoted Kevin Weil, its head of revenue products, to oversee the entire product organization. That means that Daniel Graf, the former Google Maps executive who Twitter hired away with some fanfare six months ago, has effectively been demoted. It's tempting to dismiss all this reshuffling as Twitter-as-usual; the company's internal divisions are the stuff of legend. The company floats along regardless of the turmoil; it turned a profit in the last quarter, even as user growth fell short of expectations. Goosing user growth is part of what the head of consumer product is supposed to do: Twitter remains difficult for newcomers to grok, and the company has experimented endlessly with tweaks to the service designed to make it more engaging. But for all the tweaks, Twitter still mostly looks and feels the way it has for years. Graf spent much of his time re-organizing teams The last two times it replaced its head of product, Twitter looked outside: first to Michael Sippey, and then to Graf. Both were outsiders who struggled to ship changes to the product once they were brought in. Sippey's tenure was most notable for a revamp to Twitter profiles and the first changes to the main timeline, particularly chaining related tweets together with blue lines. Graf has less to show for his six months at the helm; employees say he had spent much of his time re-organizing various teams.   Meanwhile the team led by Weil, a 31-year-old engineer, was shipping some of the most significant developments to the product in ages. Crucially, Weil is an insider — he's worked at the company since 2009, and is popular among his coworkers. It shows in what he has been able to ship: Last week at Flight, the company's first developer conference in four years, Twitter unveiled an ambitious plan to kill the password, called Digits; improvements to Twitter's ad platform, MoPub; new features for Crashlytics, its suite of developer tools. That came a month after Twitter added commerce to its platform, letting you buy things directly from tweets. If you're cynical, you might see Weil's elevation to the head of product as evidence the company is more concerned with revenue than the consumer experience. But one person I spoke with at Twitter says it's just the opposite — that if anything, Weil will have less time for revenue products than before. And Ryan Sarver, a former head of Twitter's platform who is now a venture capitalist, welcomed the news.   HUGE and smart move for Twitter to name @kevinweil head of all product. They need someone who can make bold product choices and he's the guy    Bold choices: it's something you hear lots of people inside and outside the company asking to make when it comes to product. For too long, Twitter's product organization has been focused on a series of endless A/B tests that haven't amounted to much. There's danger in big change, of course; Twitter's most passionate users, myself included, often resist major changes to the service. But members of Twitter's product team have been looking for someone to help them break the logjam above their heads for some time now. Weil just might be the person to do it.

That, according to IDC's latest figures, is enough to place it in third spot behind established leaders Samsung and Apple, overshadowing global competitors like Lenovo and LG. Xiaomi's rise has been remarkable both for how quick it has been and for the fact that the company still operates primarily in its home market of China. It has recently broadened its reach to adjacent countries in Southeast Asia like India and Singapore, but its growth remains testament to the incredible explosion in smartphone demand that China is experiencing. A separate report from Strategy Analytics agrees with IDC's conclusions, while also highlighting Samsung as the biggest market share loser. Both data firms report Samsung ceding roughly 10 percentage points, meaning it's gone from commanding a third of the global smartphone market a year ago to a quarter today. The impact of this slowdown has been felt immediately by Samsung, which just reported its smallest set of quarterly earnings in a long time. Apple's as steady as ever, growing iPhone shipments with the release of its new 6 series, while LG, Lenovo, and Huawei are among a big group of companies contesting the fourth and fifth spots.

Credit cards and cash are still on the front lines, but the bigger changes will come when startups bring their innovations inside the banking industry itself. ""We’re at a very interesting time where technology has evolved to the point the customers are demanding better experiences,"" says Chad Ballard,  Director of Innovation and Mobility at Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria (BBVA), one of the largest banks in the world. ""Banks traditionally have not been able to facilitate a good customer experience when it comes to payments."" ""Startups whose very existence is designed to redefine the financial services industry."" Today Dwolla, a payment startup backed by some of tech’s top investors, announced a partnership with BBVA Compass, the financial giant’s American arm. Compass is adopting FiSync, a Dwolla service that dramatically speeds up the time it takes transfer money while reducing the fees involved. ""We've set our minds on being the best bank in this digital century, and we believe strongly that the best way to get there is to combine our in-house capabilities — our real-time core banking platform, for one — with startups whose very existence is designed to redefine the financial services industry,"" said BBVA Compass Chairman and CEO Manolo Sánchez. Dwolla’s platform bypasses the constraints of the Automated Clearing House, or ACH, a system that has remained virtually unchanged since the 1970s and which is still largely required by law. ACH is the reason it can take days to transfer money between two accounts at different banks, even when the actual transaction is a digital exchange that can move as quickly as the bits will travel. ACH also imposes fees of 15 to 95 cents per transaction. Dwolla, by contrast, charges a 25 cent flat fee for any transaction over $10, with everything under that being free. What if you could pay your utility bill in real-time? When Dwolla rolls out on BBVA Compass in the first quarter of 2015, it will allow the bank’s customers to do a few interesting things. A startup with employees that use the bank, for example, could pay its workers in real time, and the cost of payroll for the company would be lowered. Likewise, a merchant in a marketplace could be paid right away for each sale, not in bulk once a week or every month. Dwolla envisions a world where you could up your utility bill to operate in real time, so you can see the money you’re spending and adjust it with the flick of a switch. Of course, the big benefit of a system like this won’t really kick in until lots of banks are using it, making it cheaper and easier to transfer money between different institutions, not just within a single company’s network. We’re beginning to see digital innovation roil traditional finance, but the incumbent networks are difficult to displace. Apple Pay is more secure than a credit card, but credit card companies still collect the same fees every time you’re at the register. Dwolla began with big ambitions of tearing down the finance industry as a whole, replacing it with something native to web. It was one of the biggest safe havens for people experimenting with Bitcoin in the early days, a network of users that envisioned money moving as fast and fluid as information in the internet age. Today’s announcement represents a much more modest victory, an incremental advance of disruptive technology into one of the world biggest and most conservative industries.",0.7526167296612865,0.24738327033871355,0.775876503111563,622,5.020900321543408,360,6.0888888888888886,0,0,"Business, Tech, Report",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

Patent searches reveal a number of filings that suggest a strong focus on transportation: there are multiple mentions of motors, scooters, and hybrid automobiles. There's also a partnership with Panasonic, which is a major supplier of EV batteries and is involved with Tesla's so-called Gigafactory. Gogoro's intellectual property also includes details on racks for rechargeable cells that could be used for battery swaps at stations around a city — imagine a scooter, for instance, with effectively unlimited charge as long as you're commuting around a city's network of battery swap kiosks.

Michigan Live reports that regional grocery chain Meijer has decided to keep accepting mobile payments besides MCX's app ""CurrentC,"" letting customers tap their NFC-enabled phones to pay for things like groceries and gas. ""We don't plan to remove or disable these systems,"" said spokesperson Frank Guglielmi. That decision separates it from companies like Walmart, Rite Aid, and Best Buy, all of which disabled their mobile payment systems over the weekend. That meant shutting out not just Apple Pay, but older and more established services like Google Wallet. They're planning to replace them with CurrentC, which is set to roll out next year, but customers so far haven't been enthused about the idea of switching to an app that benefits retailers but isn't integrated into a larger ecosystem like Google's or Apple's. To make things worse, some people who signed up for invitations were informed thattheir email addresses had leaked in a hack, a fairly minor security issue that nonetheless didn't leave a good impression. Meijer has roughly 200 locations across five states, making it far from the most influential MCX member. But it's the first we know of to say that it's not going to disable its NFC payment system. It's not clear whether it will face penalties for doing so. Anonymous sources told The New York Times that companies could face ""steep fines"" if they break their contracts with MCX, though the CEO later denied this in a press conference. MCX has also left open the possibility of accepting Apple Pay in the future, once CurrentC has had a chance to launch. When asked by Recode whether Meijer would be barred from using CurrentC, MCX's COO gave a vague answer: ""I think if they want to go forward and continue to accept Apple Pay, down the road at some point if they want to be a customer of MCX and roll out CurrentC and offer it to customers that's great.""",0.5601451976661591,0.4398548023338409,0.7580865935128287,360,4.8472222222222223,243,5.4609053497942384,0,0,"Apple, Business, Tech",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

The Post writes that two parties — industry group USTelecom and regional service provider Alamo Broadband — have respectively filed suit in Washington and New Orleans. USTelecom thinks that the rules, which were officially released on March 12th, are not ""legally sustainable,"" and that the FCC should abandon its decision to regulate broadband under Title II of the Communications Act. ""We do not block or throttle traffic, and FCC rules prohibiting blocking or throttling will not be the focus of our appeal,"" said senior vice president Jon Banks in a statement. Alamo believes it's suffering harm under the new requirements, which ban internet service providers from blocking, discriminating against, or speeding up internet traffic from specific sources. The FCC quickly confirmed these lawsuits. In a statement given to The Verge, a spokesperson for the FCC said: ""The Commission was served today with two challenges to the Open Internet Order. We believe that the petitions for review filed today are premature and subject to dismissal."" There's been widespread speculation about whether (or when) internet service providers might sue over the rules that FCC chair Tom Wheeler introduced in February. The last set of net neutrality rules failed to stand up to a lawsuit by Verizon, which argued that they imposed unfair regulations against broadband companies. The current policy was drafted to get around this issue; it redefines broadband as a Title II ""telecommunications service"" that can be more firmly governed than its previous designation, an ""information service."" Title II can be used for relatively heavy, utility-style rules, but Wheeler has promised to forbear on the stricter sections, as well as any that would mandate new fees. Beyond the actual content of the rules, the big question is whether companies actually have any standing to sue at this point. The proposal was voted on late last month, and the details were publicly available as of two weeks ago, but they haven't yet been published in the Federal Register, which would set a date for them to take effect. Unnamed legal experts have told the Post that ""certain sections"" of the FCC's rules took effect when they were published to the agency's site, allowing companies to file complaints before the rules are actually in place, although this seems highly debatable. USTelecom acknowledges the possibility that it will have to appeal later, after the rules are entered, but says it filed the earliest possible complaint ""out of an abundance of caution."" Whatever the case, these almost certainly won't be the first lawsuits the FCC will have to defend its net neutrality decision against.

The Republican governor's office said lethal injection would remain the primary method for executing inmates on death row, but the move comes at a time when the necessary drugs are in short supply across the US. Under the law, inmates would be killed by a firing squad only if the state cannot acquire lethal injection drugs 30 days prior to the scheduled execution date. ""We regret anyone ever commits the heinous crime of aggravated murder to merit the death penalty and we prefer to use our primary method of lethal injection when such a sentence is issued,"" Marty Carpenter, a spokesman for Herbert's office, said in a statement Monday. ""However, when a jury makes the decision and a judge signs a death warrant, enforcing that lawful decision is the obligation of the executive branch."" Drug shortages push states toward new alternatives All 34 states that allow for capital punishment use lethal injection as the primary method, though some offer alternatives. Inmates in the state of Washington can request hanging, and prisoners in Florida can choose between lethal injection or electrocution. In Oklahoma, where a gruesome botched execution made headlines last year, firing squads can be used only if electrocution and lethal injection are ever found to be unconstitutional. (The state's Republican lawmakers have also proposed a bill that would allow inmates to be executed in gas chambers.) Utah's new law makes it the only state to allow for firing squad executions without such legal caveats, according to the Associated Press. A proposal to bring back the firing squad in Wyoming died earlier this month. Other states have begun exploring alternatives as European drug manufacturers have begun restricting supplies of lethal injection drugs under a 2011 EU export embargo. Utah is the only state to execute inmates by firing squads in the last 40 years; three have been killed by firing squad since 1976, when the Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty. The state ended the practice in 2004, on the grounds that it attracted too much media attention, though inmates convicted prior to the ban could still choose it. The last inmate to die by firing squad was Ronnie Lee Gardner, who was executed in 2010. Republican Rep. Paul Ray, the bill's sponsor, has argued that firing squads could offer a quicker, more humane alternative to the botched lethal injections seen in recent years, adding that it was important for the state to have a backup method. But critics, including the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), have described the method as outdated and barbaric.

While I wouldn't call it groundbreaking — even back then it was pretty clearly riffing on concepts X-Men had explored years prior — it was just good. Series creator and showrunner Tim Kring did something different with the show that year; he took a group of ordinary but compelling people, gave them superpowers, and threw them into a mystery that could decide the fate of the world. Nine years have passed since then, and Heroes is by now a joke. People talk about that first season fondly. The second season was rough, sure, but there was that writer's strike. Never mention seasons three and four. Still, Kring has hope he can bring audiences who were so burned by the original run back to the series, right along with new fans. He knows he and NBC need to do something different all over again, and they have a chance with Heroes Reborn. It just happens to be much harder to do in 2015. ""People may say they want the old show back, but if you give them that, they'll hate you for it."" ""The truth is,"" Kring told me, ""when the show came out, it looked and felt like nothing else on TV. And here we are nine years later and there are lots of things that look and feel like Heroes did. People may say that they want the old show back, but if you give them [that], they'll hate you for it. So we tried to create a brand new idea here."" Easier said than done. The footage released at Comic-Con shows a world five years removed from the end of the original series. People with superpowers (called EVOs) are being hunted down and murdered by a hateful society. Older characters like Noah Bennett, otherwise known as HRG (aka ""horn-rimmed glasses""), are now on the run, while new characters must cope with a darker, more violent world. Overall, this direction seems shrug-worthy at best. The series has seemingly moved away from the wonder on display in the first season and gone full bore into grimdark territory, which is already so tired. Fans willing to give the new series a chance have every reason in the world to worry. However, Kring assured me that ""the paint is still wet,"" that he is doing everything he can to go in new directions, and that there’s so much more story to tell in this revival. That gave me a little bit of hope despite all my misgivings. Heroes Reborn isn't special on its own, and Kring knows it. It isn't the only show about superheroes on television anymore — shows like Daredevil and Arrow are already on people's radar. It isn't the only reboot of a beloved series that's hitting TV either, what with X-Files and Twin Peaks ready to make comebacks. The only way to make this fallen series work is to do something different. Otherwise, not only will it be be bad but utterly irrelevant. That Kring and NBC know that is a good sign, even if it isn't a sure sign of success. Heroes is back to square one I won't pretend that I think Reborn can reach the heights of the first season. That first run worked so well because it felt so new. But maybe this effort can be something quality, something that overcomes past failures. Kring and the Heroes name are back at square one. Maybe that’s a good thing.",0.2547739017350662,0.7452260982649338,0.17919629491995412,591,4.4602368866328259,329,5.316109422492401,0,0,"Comic-Con, Culture, Entertainment, TV",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

The behind-the-scenes reel for Star Wars: The Force Awakens and the new Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice trailer were no doubt the biggest hits, but there were a ton of other clips released during the convention. Ranging from a dance number promoting the Hunger Games to Bruce Campbell swinging his chainsaw against the Evil Dead, there was a lot to take in, so we've assembled it all for your right here.   One of the most intriguing things about this featurette is how little new footage it shows — even the opening slates are taken from shots that were in last year’s teaser trailer. But the music echoes the sense of optimism that fans are feeling, and overall it drives home the point that the filmmakers have been emphasizing: they made this movie as a callback to the originals, with visuals and effects to match. Also: Simon Pegg!   Here’s what we know: Batman has a very personal reason for wanting to go after Superman. Wonder Woman looks like a force to be reckoned with. Lex Luthor has some really questionable hair.   Originally this Hall H clip was filed under ""things you can't see until further notice,"" much like Legendary's Warcraft trailer. Given that we don't live in 1997, however, leaked footage of the clip made it online, prompting director David Ayer to get mad on Twitter and release the footage to the rest of the world. If that wasn't just the real plan all along.   Before Gwendoline Christie was Brienne of Tarth, she was an actor vying for the role of Brienne of Tarth. HBO’s reel gives us a look at the auditions for some of the show’s most beloved (and loathed) characters. My personal favorite? Carice van Houten summoning the Lord of Light for her Melisandre audition… before realizing she messed up her lines.   Heroes blew people away when it debuted in 2006, though it quickly cooled off in the minds of many fans. This trailer for its revival plays things close to the vest — but there’s a surprise waiting at the end.   When something strikes the perfect tone, it just works — no matter how random it might be. Though I was wondering what this would look like if they were all doing the ""Thriller"" dance.   The Walking Dead likes putting audiences into an uncomfortable place, and then slowly, methodically squeezing until they reach the breaking point. The new season, which kicks off October 11th with a 90-minute episode, looks to be staying very true to form.   In most zombie movies or TV shows, the outbreak lasts for the first act and then things hustle along to people dealing with the aftermath. For AMC’s prequel series, the network seems to be going in the opposite direction: taking time to dwell in the confusion and horror of a world falling apart, one life at a time.   If you like the original Evil Dead, Evil Dead 2, or Army of Darkness, this trailer will make you grin uncontrollably — for both its gory audacity and the ridiculousness that Bruce Campbell is able to pull off. If you haven’t seen those films, stop now, and watch all three. I’ll be waiting.   So, Doctor Who is great, and Peter Capaldi is doing fine, and this trailer has lots of lovely shots of the TARDIS and Jenna Coleman looking concerned. But the tease at the end… what have we here?   If there’s one constant in the universe, it’s that Benedict Cumberbatch is always eminently watchable, even if he’s playing a version of Sherlock Holmes in Victorian England. (Wha?) I’m still thinking over Martin Freeman’s mustache.   Let’s be honest — it’s been super easy to dismiss this movie. The Man From UNCLE isn’t the most beloved of properties, and there’s been more than a few spy movie riffs lately. But Guy Ritchie is also the man that directed Snatch, so I’m holding out hope for this one. I’ll probably regret it.   The Walking Dead creator Robert Kirkman isn’t just into zombies — he likes to dabble in demonic possession, too. This new Starz series is based on his comic of the same name, and features Patrick Fugit (Almost Famous, Gone Girl) as a man who… well, you’ll get the idea.   The basic premise of this Philip K. Dick TV adaptation is that the Axis powers were victorious in World War II, leading to a world where Germany and Japan each rule over half of the former United States. While the pilot didn’t blow us away, there’s a lot to play with if Amazon gets the rest of the series right.   Bill Murray kicked off Comic-Con on Thursday with a surprise appearance in Hall H, talking about his upcoming Barry Levinson comedy. He plays a rock manager that finds himself stuck in Afghanistan, and apparently Danny McBride is there acting like Danny McBride.   If two Walking Dead shows weren’t enough, Comic-Con had even more zombies. ""Shadows of Evil"" is a zombie-themed co-op mode for Black Ops III set in the 1940s. How does that tie into the rest of the game’s futuristic cyber-soldier concepts? Stop asking questions.   What matches up with Doc Brown’s time traveling DeLorean? The TARDIS, of course. Doctor Who joins Lego Dimensions in what’s shaping up to be the biggest IP-palooza this side of Disney Infinity.   When I think of Comic-Con trailers I want to share, Crackle isn’t the first network that comes to mind. That is, unless it’s for a totally inappropriate puppet show starring Bryan Cranston as a washed-up superhero named Titanium Rex.

This isn't the heartfelt speech at the end of a sports film; it's the lesson to be learned from a new video game that in no flowery terms is just soccer played with super cars. It's a reboot that makes good on the promise of the original I never played Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Power Battle-Cars when it was released in 2008. Released on PlayStation 3, SARPBC was shredded by critics at the time. In fact, I hadn't even heard about the car-sports hybrid until today when I learned it's the prequel to Rocket League, the best surprise video game release this summer. Rocket League is labeled as a sequel, but it's more akin to a reboot. The game finesses the look and design of the original, which you can see for yourself. Here's SARBPC:  And here's Rocket League:  What changed? Rocket League includes a camera that better follows the ball, making the game easier to play. The new game obviously looks better, with stadiums lined in thick, grassy turf and smoke plumes trailing behind its vehicles. Customization options are plentiful, so your ride now can look like the Batmobile or the A-Team van. But what I expect will grab many people's attention is its local multiplayer mode, which unlike in 2008, feels like a rare gift in 2015. Big budget games like Halo 5 are trimming split-screen multiplayer modes, but after a night lost to Rocket League — which elicits the same rage and joy as traditional sports — the death of split-screen feels all the more tragic.   Developer Psyonix has devoted years to the project, with an announcement in 2011, an update on its status in 2013, word of a new name in 2014, and release last week. That's unflagging commitment for a concept that got dragged through the mud its first time around. The commitment paid off, at least in terms of the game's quality. The designers have created a game in which playing soccer with rocket-powered, backflipping, ride-walling cars is fun, but also relatively easy to enjoy from the very first round.

Dedicated gaming handhelds have largely given way to smartphones and tablets, and while the Nintendo 3DS is still relatively popular, Sony's portable has been on life support for some time. It's a great system if you love indie games and old PS One titles, but the audience for that isn't exactly huge. PlayStation Mobile, then, is a niche within a niche, a tucked away section of the digital store where any developer can publish basically any game they want. PS Mobile is filled with junk, but it's also home to some of my favorite games of the past few years, games that many people missed largely because they didn't even know they existed. Starting tomorrow, they won't exist; Sony is discontinuing the service for good. If you own a Vita, you should download these games while you still can.  First launched in 2012, Mobile was Sony's attempt to create an open market for indie developers to release games not only on Vita, but also on select Sony phones and tablets as well. But, much like Xbox Live Indie Games on the 360, the service never took off. It turns out that when you don't curate an online store, it quickly fills with junk. PSM is home to plenty of bad attempts at retro-style games, barely functioning action games, and, of course, a few Minecraft clones. It didn't help that the Mobile section was buried in the PlayStation Store, not even included in the ""game"" section, and that the titles that were actually worth playing received little in the way of promotion. The death of PlayStation Mobile was announced in March, but it was in no way surprising; Sony cut Android support for the service in 2014, and the company rarely ever even acknowledged Mobile's existence outside of the odd software update. Support was later added for PlayStation TV owners, but that didn't help much.  But there are some really great games on the service. Some, like the wonderful sci-fi strategy game Rymdkapsel, have since been ported to iOS or other platforms, but a number of these games are only available to download on your Vita. That includes Tokyo Jungle Mobile, a strange turn-based strategy game set in a world where humans are gone and animals rule Japan's biggest city. It's a spinoff of cult PS3 hit Tokyo Jungle, and it's bizarrely addictive. There's nothing quite like surviving the wilderness as a bloodthirsty Pomeranian. There's also Passing Time, sort of a pixelated NBA Jam for soccer, made by the same team behind the PS4 and Vita music game Hohokum. It chops soccer up into pieces, turning things like corner kicks into their own puzzles, and it also features a passing mini-game that turns a round of keep away into an addictive arcade game. Other highlights include the clever puzzler 10x8, and Gunhouse, a game where you literally build a house out of guns to defend against incoming enemies. Admittedly, it's not a huge library of games, but there's some excellence to be found which will soon be gone for good. And we don't even know what time the service will be shutting down. Thankfully, if you already bought these games, you can continue to redownload them until September 10th. The final game to hit the service is Oh Deer, an OutRun-style driving game where the goal is to smash deer with a wood-paneled station wagon. It's ridiculous and fun, weird and rough around the edges in a way most modern games aren't. It only costs $0.49, and it has a soundtrack from the composer behind Streets of Rage 3.

On Friday night, Lucasfilm held its Comic-Con panel for Star Wars: The Force Awakens, and it unquestionably stole the convention. Adam Driver and Gwendoline Christie talked about working on the movie for the first time, J.J. Abrams played a behind-the-scenes featurette, and Harrison Ford came out to riff and reminisce with Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher. It was basically the ultimate Star Wars event — and that was before Abrams announced that all 6,500 people in Hall H were then going to be attending a secret Star Wars concert with the San Diego Symphony orchestra. (Lightsabers were included.)  We were there for both events, and while it’s all good times for the faithful, it’s a slightly different proposition for people like us that are covering these things. We’re supposed to remain impartial — not only from promotional voodoo, but from the reality distortion field that comes with putting that many people that love one thing all in one place. But by the time fireworks began lighting up the sky, we couldn’t help it: we were swept up in the moment like everyone else.  We immediately began talking: how did this end up being good? Was there something legitimate about the experience, despite it being a massive promotional event designed to hype a movie that’s still five months away? And if that was true for the concert, what did it say about the “immersive experiences” and installations that make up the rest of Comic-Con’s promotional wonderland?   Bryan Bishop: The night was a surreal experience. Being in Hall H is always a rush-of-the-moment kind of situation — if you’re in that room, you ride the wave of energy no matter what — and between the behind-the-scenes video and Harrison Ford showing up, people were ecstatic. But when Abrams announced the free concert, it went up another level entirely. Kwame Opam: I agree completely. Chris Hardwick announced that we were actually leaving Hall H for a concert together, and I immediately thought, “This is insane. Can they do this? This is absolutely insane.” It’s days later now, and I’m still stunned they pulled it off. Other panels couldn’t hope to command that kind of love and excitement from the crowd. Not even Warner Bros. for Batman v. Superman. By the time we got outside and to the venue, we were being handed lightsabers. At that point, it was beyond clear we were being swallowed up by the Star Wars brand. And I was fine with it. BB: There was a moment before the concert started, while they were playing all the pre-show music (which, for some reason, included a dance remix of “Don’t Stop Believing”), when “Sweet Child O’ Mine” came on. I grew up in the ‘80s, so of course I loved it, and there I was: lightsaber in hand, with Guns N’ Roses playing at some bizarro Star Wars concert at Comic-Con. I put both hands in the air and said, “This is the perfect event!” If you’re Lucasfilm, that’s the exact reaction you want people to have — and that was before Abrams and the cast came out on stage, lightsabers in hand. Gwendoline Christie led 6,000-plus people in a lightsaber salute. There were fireworks. And while one easy take is that everybody was being manipulated in the name of commerce, I actually think that’s too binary. This may sound nuts, but I think Abrams actually dug the fact that they could do something like this.     KO: Definitely. Abrams is as much a fan as anyone in the crowd. There was a moment during the panel where he talked about how the fact that he was chosen to direct the new Star Wars makes no sense. He’s, of course, the steward and one of the faces of a massive international brand that makes tons of money, but he’s also a guy who loves the franchise. And that shone through. You can always be cynical (or at least on-guard for Brand Infiltration). The lightsabers had Duracell branding. The show itself was sponsored by Verizon. Fans are being pulled body and soul into years and years of Star Wars movies, comics, games, and cartoons, and it’ll all make Disney a lot of money. But Friday was an acknowledgment that fans love this stuff and have loved it for years. Extraordinary care was made to make the concert an event worth being at, and deference was paid to what makes the series great. How could you not feel something when Harrison Ford hugged it out with Mark Hamill? It really makes you want to believe that love conquered commerce. BB: The sight of them hugging like old buddies thawed the heart of a generation (though I still think Hamill had been drinking). So let’s just say the thing that you don’t say when you’re on guard against Brands: there is a difference between the experience that’s being provided and the commercial or brand motivations behind said experience.  Ultimately, all mainstream entertainment is a commercial endeavor, but we (mostly) don’t begrudge movies, TV, and music for that. Shouldn’t the same be true for “experiences,” however that’s defined? Like SXSW and other shows, Comic-Con is filled with branded installations and tie-ins that offer all kinds of real-world interactions — all to promote some show, product, or property. Sometimes it’s a haunted house with VR; other times it’s an escape room. They’re easy to mock, but these are unique experiences that bridge the gap between the real world and traditional entertainment — and just because it’s marketing that’s making it happen, that doesn’t mean that there’s not a genuine thing buried in there, somewhere.  I get frustrated by the amount of bad, tie-in virtual reality experiences that are out there, for example. But that’s still a lot of companies investing in virtual reality content. Not to mention the exposure it brings to the medium. It’s hard to say that’s a bad thing.   KO: I don’t know that we should let go of our suspicion of Brands on an overarching media level, but Brands are a constant. Marketing is constant. That doesn’t mean the experiences they offer us as consumers are inherently evil. We weren’t somehow hypnotized into thinking that Star Wars is worth caring about. The people in the crowd came from all over, had different connections to the property, and got to share in something that felt good and, most importantly, felt sincere. They were brand activated, yes, but the experience was valid. And here’s the real point: fans already do that themselves! Any cosplayer wants to feel like the brand they love is out in the real world with them. They dress up in outrageous costumes for days because they’re buying into what they care deeply about. They are conspicuous consumers, and they want these experiences. As impressive (and surely expensive) as the concert was, all Disney created was a venue for everyone to let their love for Star Wars sing out. And it felt like it came from the right place. BB: So… lightsabers on opening night, right? KO: Activated. Lightsabers were handed out on admission. J.J. Abrams and producer Kathleen Kennedy address the crowd.

The series is written by The Wire creator David Simon and William F. Zorzi, and directed by Crash's Paul Haggis. Oscar Isaac is starring as Nick Wasicsko, the young mayor of Yonkers, NY elected amidst a major shift in the city's public housing policy. (It's based on the 1999 nonfiction book of the same name by former New York Times reporter Lisa Belkin.) The cast is filled out by Catherine Keener, Jim Belushi, Winona Ryder, and Alfred Molina, and the trailer is simmering with the sort of racial and political tension Simon and Haggis have built their careers on dissecting. HBO is catching Isaac at the perfect time. He's coming off acclaimed, intense work in both A Most Violent Year and Ex Machina, and he's poised to become a major player in two of the world's biggest franchises: Star Wars (this December), and X-Men (next year). In the Show Me a Hero trailer, he's quivering under the weight of intense civic pressure and a terrible haircut. I couldn't keep my eyes off him, and I'm giddy at the chance to see him take a crack at Simon's fiery diatribes against racism and inequality. The show's major themes are still relevant today Show Me a Hero has good timing for reasons beyond the momentum of its actors. The series is arriving in the wake of a Supreme Court decision condemning the racist implementation of housing policies that have created lasting segregation. This means the series is filling a different role now than it would have two months ago — instead of serving as a historical document, it's more like a prologue to this year's real change.

The impact this breach could have on millions of marriages — not just of celebrities and politicians but people typically out of the public spotlight — could be historical. While the implications of a data breach like this have been analyzed in the past, the lessons have been largely ignored. Take this moment to consider the five laws of your life online. Like laws of the state, whether or not you choose to learn these laws is irrelevant, as you will be tried by them regardless. 1.Assume everything you do and say will be made public. 2.Do not be seduced by privacy settings and passwords, which are temporary illusions that distract from the reality of the previous point. 3.Understand that context and data are often one and the same. When you enter information on the internet, assume that you include the who (you), the what (the data), the when (the time of data input), the where (the site on which the data is being placed), the how (the device on which you input the data), and the why (the purpose of the site). 4.Believe that all of your credit card transactions are being kept in a colossal, searchable ledger that one day will be made available for all to study. 5.Believe that data does not disappear when you delete it. Everything goes mainstream eventually. Soon you'll be able to say you were paranoid before it was cool. Take solace in knowing everyone may now join the ranks of celebrities, who have lived for decades in constant fear of the infringement of their privacy.

Krebs on Security is reporting on one such scheme, noticed by an email provider in Milwaukee that found the following message being spammed to its subscribers: When a second cache of data from the Ashley Madison hack was published earlier today, reporters rushed to download and sort through the contents, expecting internal data akin to the leak published earlier this week. But now that The Verge has spent some time looking through the data, it appears to be something significantly more innocuous, primarily detailing the backend operations of Avid Life Media's various web properties. The hackers behind this week's leak of Ashley Madison user data may have released more details, this time about the company itself. Motherboard first reported the new data and an accompanying message, which has been confirmed by The Verge. The torrent and message were posted on the same Quantum Magazine Tor site where the initial dump appeared ""Hey Noel, you can admit it's real now,"" says a message signed by the hackers — a reference to parent company Avid Life Media's CEO Noel Biderman.

In fact, far more parents are neglecting to immunize their children with Gardasil, a cancer vaccine. Gardasil provides immunity against several strains of HPV, a virus known to be responsible for numerous forms of cancer — most notably cervical and anal — and genital warts. The vaccine is incredibly effective: in its original form, it protects against the four strains of HPV that cause 70 percent of cervical cancer cases and 90 percent of genital warts; an updated version approved this past December protects against five additional strains, potentially eliminating 90 percent of cervical, vulvar, vaginal, and anal cancers. When given before first sexual contact, Gardasil can offer near full protection against the most common sexually transmitted infection (STI), as well as the life-threatening cancers that sometimes result from it. only 38 percent of adolescent girls had received all three doses of the vaccine But nearly a decade after its introduction to market, rates of Gardasil inoculation are still low. As recently as 2013, only 38 percent of adolescent girls ages 13–17 (the primary target group for inoculation) had received all three doses of the vaccine in the US — about half the rate seen in other developed countries, like Australia. There are several reasons for this lag in vaccination rates. As with any vaccine, there’s a small number of people who refuse Gardasil out of a general stance against vaccination. But that’s not why most people avoid Gardasil. These people are both parents who fear that inoculating children against an STI will encourage reckless and promiscuous behavior and, more surprisingly, are educated parents who consider themselves pro-sex and pro-vaccine, but simply aren’t convinced that Gardasil itself is safe, especially for children.     (Eugene Peretz)  Though much has been made of Gardasil’s status as sex-related vaccine, a study recently published in JAMA Internal Medicine indicates that fears of Gardasil-induced promiscuity are likely misguided. An investigation of insurance claims from over 200,000 teenage girls (about 10 percent of whom had received Gardasil) showed no indication that vaccination made girls more likely to engage in risky sexual behavior. there's no indication that a simple vaccine acts as a catalyst for sexual behaviorThe idea that a vaccine like Gardasil might promote unsafe behavior isn’t entirely baseless. One study found a correlation between STI-related treatments (in this case, HIV therapies) and an increase in risky sexual behaviors, says Anupam Jena, an author of the more recent study on Gardasil. But, Jena points out, there’s a vast difference between HIV-infected adults (many of whom have a history of engaging in risky sex- or drug-related behavior) and adolescent girls. In the case of teenage girls, there’s no indication that a simple vaccine acts as a catalyst for sexual behavior, risky or otherwise. At most, Jena’s study indicated that girls who are already engaging in risky sexual behavior are more likely to get vaccinated with Gardasil. That's important for understanding the study's outcome. Girls who received the vaccine did have higher infection rates after inoculation, but they also had higher rates of STIs before they ever got the shot. Once researchers controlled for that factor, the differences between the vaccine and control groups vanished. To the extent that there’s any correlation between vaccination and promiscuity, it’s a heartening one: girls who might need the vaccine most are seeking it out. adverse reactions are real, but they're also rareBut the mythical connection between Gardasil and risky sexual behavior is only one part of the misinformation that plagues the shot; just as pernicious are rumors about its safety. One frequently cited (and debunked) anecdote blames Gardasil for the death of 32 women. Some cite negative experiences that friends, family, and loved ones have had with the vaccine as a reason to steer clear. ""I got the shot, stood up, walked into Planned Parenthood’s lobby to pay, and passed out, but with seizure-like symptoms. I apparently was moaning and moving around, though totally unconscious,"" AC Shilton told The Verge of her own experience with Gardasil. ""It’s a total mystery as to what happened. I had never had a vaccine reaction before, have no known medical allergies and am generally a really healthy person."" While adverse experiences like Shilton’s are real, they’re also rather rare – as Matthew Herper notes in Forbes, the MMR vaccine has received more than double the number of adverse effect reports as Gardasil.     Prevalence of high-risk and low-risk types of HPV among women 14 to 59, 2003 through 2006. (Hariri S, Unger ER, Sternberg M, Dunne EF, Swan D, Patel S, et al)  These fears, on examination, seem to come from a more general anxiety about science, medicine, and the effects of new technology. In talking to people with hesitations about Gardasil, I repeatedly heard refrains about how new and unproven the vaccine is. Parents cited the relatively recent release of the vaccine, ignoring the fact that Gardasil’s human trials were over a decade ago — and that, aside from the virus itself, there’s very little that's actually new or innovative about Gardasil at all, says Greg Moe, a scientist working with the Children’s Hospital Oakland Research Institute.  Almost all the vaccine’s ingredients ""could be found in a typical vitamin pill.""Though some parents cite scary-sounding ingredients that make up Gardasil as a reason to hesitate, virtually everything found in Gardasil (including intimidating sounding items like polysorbate 80 and sodium borate) can be found in many common food products, pharmaceuticals, and even the human body. Almost all the vaccine’s ingredients ""could be found in a typical vitamin pill,"" Moe says. Furthermore, the science behind Gardasil isn’t particularly new: the adjuvant used to increase immune response (and create immunity), has been used for over 50 years in vaccines safely given to hundreds of millions of people; similarly, yeast-based vaccines like Gardasil have been used for decades with no ill effect. Given Gardasil’s safety and efficacy, only one real question remains: is wide-scale inoculation actually necessary from a public health perspective? In 2011, NPR reported that Diane Harper, a professor at the University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Medicine who worked on studies that led to Gardasil’s approval, had expressed reservations about mandatory Gardasil inoculation among youth. Harper had no concerns about the vaccine’s safety or efficacy; she merely felt Gardasil inoculation wasn’t as imperative as marketing campaigns might suggest. Even without Gardasil, Pap smears have been proven highly effective at detecting cervical cancer cells while they’re in a pre-cancerous, and very treatable, stage. Similarly, genital warts — though unsightly and embarrassing — are highly treatable and rarely fatal. For these health concerns, Gardasil is less a major breakthrough than an improved solution for a problem we’d already more or less solved.     On the left, a normal cell from a Pap smear. On the right, an HPV-infected cell. (Ed Uthman)  But cervical cancer and genital warts aren’t the only threat posed by HPV: over the past decade, the virus has been implicated in throat and anal cancer, neither of which are as easily detected and prevented as cervical cancer.  And though Gardasil isn’t the only way of preventing cervical cancer, it’s far more pleasant than undergoing a colposcopy and removal of part of the cervix. Given the option, why wouldn’t we want to spare adolescents the pain, suffering, and expense of having to deal with HPV? parents only have a limited amount of control over their children's sexual decisions Perhaps, it comes back to the fact that Gardasil is associated with sex, and for some parents, acknowledging their children’s potential future sex lives feels a bit too much like ceding control over their children’s most intimate decisions. ""Children as young as nine are urged to begin the series, with the assumption that they will be sexually active soon thereafter,"" says Erica Sandberg, a generally pro-vaccine parent — with the exception of Gardasil. ""I find that horrible. Will some? Unfortunately, yes. But I’ve been highly involved with my daughter’s education regarding these matters since she could speak and… I’m secure that she’ll make smart decisions."" The anxiety is understandable. But it stems from this unavoidable fact: parents only have a limited amount of control over their children’s sexual decisions. However smart those decisions are, HPV — which can be transmitted even when condoms are used — is still a very real risk. In fact, it’s the most commonly transmitted STI tracked by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, one with potentially fatal consequences. ""Here is a therapy we have to prevent cancer, and we’re not using it,"" says Jena — something that would be unthinkable were we discussing a vaccination for colon or skin cancer. Hopefully, with continued awareness and education, we’ll be able to reverse that course.",0.5197979993448804,0.48020200065511964,0.603461151167355,1498,5.3357810413885183,754,6.5543766578249336,0,6,"Science, Report",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Of the seven drugs included in the study, alcohol was the deadliest at an individual level, followed by heroin, cocaine, tobacco, ecstasy, methamphetamines, and marijuana. Previous studies consistently ranked marijuana as the safest recreational drug, but it was not known that the discrepancy was this large. The researchers determined the mortality risk by comparing a lethal dose of each substance with the amount typically used. Not only was marijuana the lowest of the drugs tested, but there was such a gap between its lethal and typical doses that they classified it as the only ""low mortality risk"" drug tested. All others were classified as ""medium"" or ""high."" Marijuana comes with a low mortality risk compared to drugs like ecstasy or tobacco These findings contradict the efforts of law enforcement agencies around the country which, despite pockets of decriminalization (and in some cases, legalization), typically focus heavily on marijuana-related arrests. The authors suggest that, based on the results, these agencies would benefit from shifting priorities away from illicit drugs and placing them instead on keeping things like alcohol and tobacco in check. In fact, the researchers believe marijuana to be so low-risk that they suggest a broad, regulated legalization of it in the paper. Attempts to compare the danger of particular drugs have been few and far between. It wasn't until the last decade that studies were done to classify the risk of drug abuse in a qualitative and quantitative manner, according to the authors. (They cite attempts at indexing the toxicity or ranking the harm of certain drugs as examples.) Before that,  they claim, the risk assessment of drug abuse was instead based heavily on anecdotal evidence, which often meant that policy decisions were largely based on educated guesses. The researchers clarified that the study does not suggest that moderate alcohol consumption poses a higher risk than regular heroin use. Environmental conditions, like dirty needles or unregulated supplies, contribute to the overall harm caused by using a drug like heroin. Instead, this study was specifically done to measure the deadliness of the substances themselves.

The rules would require companies to create contingency plans in the event of a spill or rig malfunction. The Interior Department's proposals, which would only apply to exploratory wells, stem from its 2014 discussions with Royal Dutch Shell to fortify the company's safety plan in the Arctic. That plan included new tugboats, an extra helicopter, and an additional oil rig capable of drilling a relief well if the first rig loses control. The administration's proposed regulations would require companies to have an additional rig at drilling sites and to construct and test an oil containment dome before drilling. Companies would need a back-up rig at drilling sites As WSJ points out, similar regulations are already in place for drilling in the Gulf of Mexico, but because of the high concentration of drilling there, rig operators often share their resources. The Arctic's remote location will mean companies will likely spend more money drilling in that region. In the past eight years, Shell has spent an estimated $6 billion on exploratory drilling off the shore of Alaska, and plans to spend $1 billion more this year. Brian Salerno, head of the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement, told Reuters that the regulations are ""designed to ensure safe energy exploration in unforgiving Arctic conditions."" Because of harsh weather in the region, energy companies can only drill safely from July to October. But, due to rapid climate change, all the ice in the Arctic is likely to melt by 2050, paving the way for an Arctic drilling boom. Opponents of offshore drilling have long clung to the hope that technical and regulatory challenges would slow down oil farming in the Arctic. Unsurprisingly, backlash to the administration's proposals has been swift. The American Petroleum Institute has called some of the requirements ""unnecessarily burdensome."" Shell was criticized for a series of offshore drilling accidents in 2012 when its oil containment system was easily crushed in a test, and its rig, the Noble Discoverer, caught fire. The missteps prompted the Interior Department to investigate Shell's operations. No energy company is currently drilling in the Arctic, but, after years of logistical setbacks, Shell plans to begin its largest Arctic exploration project to date in the Chukchi and Beaufort seas this summer. ConocoPhillips and Statoil also have leases in the ocean.

Throughout the month, Bill will be sharing his vision of how technology will revolutionize life for the world's poor by 2030 by narrating episodes of the Big Future, our animated explainer series. In addition, we'll be publishing a series of features exploring the improvements in banking, health, farming, and education that will enable that revolution. And while the topics reflect the bets Bill and his wife Melinda are making with their foundation, they've asked us for nothing less than fully independent Verge journalism, which we're more than happy to deliver. Turns out Bill Gates is a pretty confident guy. Nilay Patel, Editor-in-Chief The parasitic worms that cause river blindness give birth to 1,600 larvae each day. ""I’ve heard people say that they feel this buzzing under the skin; they feel the little larvae under the skin and it’s itchy,"" says Elodie Ghedin, a molecular parasitologist at New York University. The larvae then travel to various parts of the body, including the eyes, where they cause inflammation and lesions when they die. Adult worms survive up to 15 years in a human host, nine of which are spent reproducing. The WHO estimates that 18 million people are infected with these parasites worldwide — in certain West African communities, about 50 percent of men over the age of 40 have been blinded by the disease. It’s a terrible illness — but it could be wiped ""off the face of the Earth"" within the next 15 years. That’s the bet that Bill and Melinda Gates are making in their 2015 annual letter. It outlines how innovations in technology, medicine, and public health will serve to better the health of the world’s poor within the next 15 years. The Gates predict that vaccines and improved care for newborns will halve the number of children who die before the age of five. The number of mothers who die in childbirth will be reduced by two-thirds. More people will begin HIV treatment each year than will be diagnosed with HIV. We will eradicate infectious diseases like polio, guinea worm, river blindness, and elephantiasis. And by 2030, science will have found a way to eradicate malaria. ""We think some very dramatic things can happen,"" Bill Gates told The Verge. These goals are ambitious. Despite a decline in new HIV infections worldwide, the World Health Organization estimates that over 2 million people tested positive in 2013. That year, the rate of children who died before the age of five in sub-Saharan Africa was double that of the worldwide average. And conflicts in countries like Syria have caused polio to surface in countries that eliminated the disease long ago. The truth is that any number of political, cultural, and environmental obstacles can derail a country’s health care progress. Yet, some developing countries have managed to make a prodigious amount of progress in a short amount of time. Here, we profile three developing countries — Uganda, Nepal, and Rwanda — that have considerably improved the lives of their citizens by focusing on key health concerns described in the 2015 letter from Bill and Melinda Gates. Can their success in reducing tropical disease transmission, maternal and infant mortality, and HIV infection rates in the face of tremendous adversity be replicated across the developing world? The eradication of neglected tropical diseases represents a big chunk of the Gates Foundation’s goals for 2030. Parasitic diseases like river blindness can be devastating for the social and economic health of a community. But some countries, like Uganda, have garnered praise among the international health community for their work on these diseases — and they’re well on their way to eliminating them altogether. ""Uganda has done a tremendous job against river blindness,"" says Thomas Unnasch, a vector biologist at the University of South Florida who receives research funding from the Gates Foundation and chairs of Uganda’s river blindness elimination expert advisory committee. No vaccines against river blindness exist, but Ugandans living in areas where transmission occurs receive two doses of a drug that treats the infections each year. Unfortunately, the drug — called ivermectin — only kills the larvae, so people infected with the parasite have to wait until the adults die or become infertile before they can consider themselves ""cured."" In the meantime, ivermectin serves to alleviate symptoms and reduces transmission. Uganda’s ivermectin distribution program has been running since 1997 thanks to drug donations from pharmaceutical company Merck, and international aid. So far, mass administration of this drug has helped interrupt transmission in 14 of Uganda’s 16 disease hot spots. The country’s organized approach to drug administration is an important factor in the disease treatment there, Unnasch says. But that isn’t the only reason Uganda has done so well: the country’s geography, combined with the peculiarities of the blackfly species that carries the parasites there also contributed. ""They have a vector that breeds only in the small streams,"" Unnasch says of the blackflies that transmit river blindness. To stop them from reproducing, workers treat small rivers once a year with an insecticide that is safe to humans. ""They just put a line of insecticide in the river, and it kills all the blackfly larvae,"" he says. In other words, the blackflies are a lot easier to handle in Uganda than in many other countries where the vectors breed in large rivers. In those situations, killing off larvae in big quantities isn’t always feasible. When it comes to maternal and child mortality rates, Nepal’s achievements stand out. Over the course of the last 10 years, the maternal mortality rate there has dropped by 40 percent. And Nepal decreased the number of children who die before the age of five by 72 percent since 1990. Although the number of child deaths is still very high — about 24,000 children under the age of five die each year — the improvements are undeniable. To address the health of Nepalese women and children, Nepal invested in its health care system. Between 2000 and 2010, the country tripled its health spending for each citizen, says Mariam Claeson, director of the Maternal, Newborn, and Child Health program at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. The government further encouraged health care access by making conditional cash transfers to women who sought care from medical facilities, starting in 2005. And the government provided free health care to women living in a third of the country. As a result, the number of children who were born in a health care facility went from 19 percent to 45 percent in just five years, says Ramesh Adhikari, a professor of pediatrics at Kathmandu Medical College in Nepal  — a change that likely ensured safer births for both mother and child. Nepal also focused on vaccines. In the last decade, the proportion of children who received annual vaccinations against tetanus, whooping cough, or a serious respiratory disease called diphtheria increased to 92 percent, from 75 percent. Foreign aid played a big role; in 2012, international organizations like GAVI and the WHO helped fund more than half the country’s routine immunizations. The result is that 9 out of every 10 infants received vaccinations for diphtheria and tuberculosis in 2012. The vaccinations have changed the country’s health care landscape: ""When I started as a pediatrician 25 years back, we would see diphtheria disease, and now we don’t see it,"" says Adhikari, who is also a chairman for national committee on immunization practices. Nepal’s focus on vaccines aligns with the Gates Foundation’s priorities. In 2013, the Foundation spent $338 million in grants related to improving vaccine delivery. These kinds of contributions can pay off: vaccines currently prevent 2 to 3 million deaths each year from diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, and measles, according to the WHO. But about 22 million infants continue to miss out on routine vaccines worldwide. The Gates Foundation and its partners want to change that by handing out vaccines against rotavirus, which causes diarrhea, and against pneumonia to ""all kids"" within the next five years, Gates says. ""Those two alone will save over a half a million lives, and that’s why we think we can go from the 1 in 20 kids — 5 percent who die before the age of 5 now — to 15 years from now to get that down to be 1 in 40,"" he says. It’s a great idea, but getting vaccines to the children who need them by 2030 won’t be easy. The introduction of novel, expensive vaccines, combined with pharmaceutical company monopolies, means that the price of fully vaccinating a child is 68 times higher than it was 10 years ago, according to Doctors Without Borders. And that increase includes shots that protect against pneumonia-causing bacteria — bacteria that caused 935,000 children under the age of five to die in 2013, according to the WHO. Sub-Saharan Africa is home to the worst HIV epidemic on the planet. About 70 percent of people who are living with HIV reside here. Despite that, countries like Rwanda are making improvements in the rate of new infections — and they’re doing it by overhauling their health systems and engaging their citizens. ""Rwanda is the greatest success story in Africa, in terms of HIV, its health system, economy, and national stature,"" says Edward Mills, an epidemiologist at Stanford University who helped assess Rwanda’s health care system for the Gates Foundation. The nation’s HIV prevalence has been at a steady 3 percent since 2005, and the number of people diagnosed with HIV in Rwanda is declining — even though more people are tested each year. In 2007, about 37,000 Rwandans tested positive for HIV; by 2013, that number went down to 13,000. Rwanda’s ability to address its HIV infection rates is impressive. But it’s even more impressive considering the country’s recent history. In 1994, the country experienced a devastating genocide. An estimated 800,000 people died over a period of 100 days. ""Every Rwandan was touched personally by the genocide,"" Mills says. In the aftermath of the tragedy, the country had to rebuild itself and its health care system, which Mills says was ""essentially destroyed."" The most important factor in Rwanda’s improvements is likely the government’s commitment to addressing HIV at all levels of the population, including the country’s most at-risk groups: sex workers and men who have sex with men. Right now, about 51 percent of sex workers in Rwanda are HIV positive. ""What the government feels is that if they were to target those populations they could break the infection chain,"" Mills says. Despite the fact that sex work is criminalized in Rwanda, female sex workers and men who have sex with men are involved in designing surveys that explore HIV prevalence and risk factors that contribute to transmission in their communities. The country has ""Female Sex Worker Coordination Committees"" operating in eight of the country’s 30 districts. These committees — which include police, health service providers, government officials, and sex workers themselves — help implement HIV programs in the districts. The Rwandan government also commissions media campaigns to discuss HIV, Mills says, and actively discourages extramarital relationships. Finally, the country has drastically scaled up Rwandans’ access to HIV services. In 2009, fewer than half of its hospitals and health centers offered HIV testing, counseling, treatment, and methods that can prevent HIV transmission between mother and child. By 2011, those services could be accessed in 75 percent of facilities. As a result, the number of women and men who received HIV test results between 2005 and 2011 went from 1 in 10 to approximately 4 in 10. ""Rwanda is not yet a success story,"" says Sabin Nsanzamana, head of the HIV, STI, and Other Blood Borne Infections Division at the Rwandan Ministry of Health. But Rwanda’s achievements demonstrate how powerful HIV interventions can be when there’s a willingness to employ them. Much like Nepal with maternal and infant mortality, Rwanda’s multi-pronged approach to HIV aligns well with the Gates Foundation’s goal of reaching an HIV ""tipping point"" by 2030 — a time when the number of new HIV infections that arise each year is surpassed by the number of people who are put on antiretroviral treatment. Rwanda could reach that goal ""within two years,"" Mills says. That said, many of Rwanda’s advances are linked to the country’s history. ""It seems that the community is pulling together to make a strong Rwanda,"" says Chris Dickey, a professor of global public health at New York University. The country’s 45,000 community health workers aren’t paid much, but they perform the work because they want to give back, he says. ""A lot of that can be traced back to the agony that was felt by the entire country in 1994,"" he says. For that reason, implementing these interventions in other countries might not be all that straightforward. ""It may or may not be a unique example,"" he says. ""Unique examples"" of success such as these dot the international development landscape. Some countries do better because they receive more foreign aid. Others benefit from more manageable climates, or more stable political systems. And some do better simply because they have more roads. In health, as in agriculture, roads are crucial for distribution. In many underdeveloped countries, there is no way to get supplies to where they’re needed most. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, there are only 1,736 miles (2,794 km) of paved roads in a country that’s two-thirds the size of Western Europe. Because roads are relatively scarce, waterways are the main source of transport, which is troublesome for anyone not living directly on one. And planes in the Congo are in notoriously poor condition, so much so that all Congolese airlines have been banned from flying in the European Union. ""There’s a lack of understanding of what’s going on in regions like the Democratic Republic of Congo… primarily because of the lack of infrastructure,"" Unnasch says. The absence of roads and reliable transportation methods limits both workers and supplies in many regions of DRC. This poses a huge barrier for companies like Merck, which has been donating the drug that treats river blindness to countries all over the world since 1987, Unnasch says. ""I serve on an expert committee that assists Merck in identifying and distributing ivermectin, and I can tell you that these issues about drug distribution…. we meet twice a year for three days, and this is basically all we can discuss."" But even when the drugs make it to where they’re needed most, they can still go bad. That’s because there’s no electricity — and no refrigeration, which is important for preserving vaccines. Moreover, poor areas often don’t have access to ambulances. In Nepal, for instance, this represents a big challenge. Aid organizations and government should think about ""developing regional transport mechanisms for preterm babies that need access to specialized services,"" Adhikari says. Right now, ""we don’t have anything to support that."" Bill Gates acknowledged some of these limitations in his interview with The Verge. The majority of the Foundation’s work has been in the health sphere, he says, and ""part of that is the upstream science — inventing new vaccines — and part of it has been the downstream. Once you have those vaccines, how do you get them out to all the world’s children?"" Infrastructure will play a huge role in determining which countries reach the health goals set out in the Gates’ annual letter. Because of this, many will fail. Though the Gates’ goals are ambitious — and many doubt our ability to reach all of them — they serve as a way to steer long-term objectives. ""The global health community and the global development community are a bit all over the place,"" says Joy Lawn, director of the Maternal, Adolescent, Reproductive, and Child Health Centre at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. ""And so from a higher level, I think being concrete and ambitious, and getting out dialogue about this is exactly the right thing to do."" In 2000, the UN proposed a series of eight goals called the Millenium Development Goals, which were designed to significantly reduce extreme poverty by 2015. These goals, much like the Gates’ letter, tackled everything from gender equality and environmental sustainability, to malaria and extreme hunger. They gave governments concrete numbers to target and empowered citizens to hold their leaders accountable. In 15 years, malaria-related deaths dropped by 25 percent globally — and by 33 percent in Africa. Extreme poverty in sub-Saharan Africa went from 59 percent in 1999 to 47 percent in 2011. And more people are receiving HIV treatment today than ever before. Setting goals ""was one of the best ideas for development either of us has ever seen,"" write Bill and Melinda Gates. These goals are by no means the only reasons for this change, but they certainly played a part. ""Everybody would agree that the Millenium Development Goals did more than anything else in history,"" Lawn says. In many ways, the Millenium Development Goals gave Nepal, Rwanda, and Uganda the opportunity to take charge of their own fate. And so, by challenging the world once more, the Gates Foundation is hoping to recapture the spirit that helped these countries make giant leaps forward. We can be realistic about our ability to recreate these particular successes, of course, but that shouldn’t prevent us from trying. Setting objectives in key areas can lead to serious change — even if we can’t reach them in the time frame set by the richest man in the world.

The answer may be both: the machine learning techniques that led to today's study — published in the journal Nature — let computers discover patterns in data. And while the methods used to help the computers learn to play video games have been around for ""several decades,"" according to an accompanying editorial, they hadn't been combined in such a useful way before.

The games the computers were learning are a better model of real-world chaos than previous games computers have mastered, like chess, Schölkopf says in his editorial. That's good news for self-driving cars and other kinds of machines that will have to interact with the world — it brings Google a step closer to being able to handle noise and complexity. The learning relied on an old technique: positive reinforcement. Whenever a computer beat a high score or moved on to a new level, it was rewarded. The AI performed better than previous methods in 43 games, and it did better than humans in 29 of them. Here's a video of how the AI learned to beat Breakout — notice how its strategy evolves as it plays more:  The positive reinforcement technique is noteworthy in that it's a form of human and animal learning, not one that's typically used for computers, write the study authors, led by Demis Hassabis, a co-founder of DeepMind and vice president of engineering at Google.

The decision follows a clear statement from the White House last month saying the president would not sign the bill into law if Congress, currently controlled by Republican lawmakers, passed it. The proposed Keystone XL pipeline is a 1,179-mile pipe that would carry 830,000 barrels of crude oil from Canadian oil sands to oil refineries on the Gulf Coast of Texas. The cost of the project has ballooned to $8 billion since it was first proposed in 2008, and though an earlier Keystone bill died in the Senate last year, the Republican-controlled Congress passed it this January. Supporters say that the pipeline would create jobs and reduce America's dependence on foreign oil. ""Keystone XL is a step in the wrong direction."" Obama has previously stated that he wants a complete review of the pipeline from his administration rather than have Congress force his hand and says that the White House has ""no final disposition"" on the subject. However, the proposal has met with staunch protests from scientists and environmentalist groups. Earlier this month, a group of more than 90 scientists and economists sent a letter to Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry urging them to reject the pipeline. ""The Keystone XL pipeline will drive expansion of the energy-intensive strip-mining and drilling of tar sands from under Canada’s Boreal forest, increasing global carbon emissions,"" they wrote. ""Keystone XL is a step in the wrong direction. Now that the bill has been vetoed, Congress will need to muster a two-thirds majority vote in both houses to override the president's decision.

There’s hardly a plot, only a meeting of some of DC’s biggest stars — Flash, Green Lantern, Hawkman — taking turns sharing tales as if they were telling ghost stories at a campfire. Spectre recounts a battle with a monster from the moon; Hawkman remembers a crisis on the island of Krakatoa. The masked vigilantes on the cover are a friendly lot, decades removed from the gritty realism that would come to dominate the industry later. The Flash wears a slightly over-sized long-sleeve shirt, emblazoned with a yellow lightning bolt. His face is as pleasant and plain as a dumpling, and on his head sits a helmet that brings to mind an overturned colander. So when an All Star Comics #3 surfaced at Heritage Auctions’ first big sale of 2012, collectors took notice. The copy was off-white, its condition ranked at 8.5 out of 10 by the Certified Guaranty Company. CGC knew of only two higher-ranked All Star #3’s in the world, one of which (a 9.6) had sold for $126,500 back in 2002. The Overstreet Comic Book Price Guide — the bible on such matters — estimated an 8.5 copy to be worth somewhere between $36,500 and $70,750. But someone bidding at the Heritage auction was willing to pay significantly more. The comic had been low-balled at first, going for $49,293.75 during the auction itself. But after the official bidding closed, private offers flooded in: $65,000, then $75,000. In the end, it sold for $200,000, putting it in the same class as a record-breaking debut Spider-Man that had sold a few years earlier. All Star #3 wasn’t the only mid-tier comic suddenly going for outrageous prices at the 2012 sale. A Sub-Mariner #14 (in which the aquatic hero Namor twists apart a Panzer tank at Normandy) sold for $4,182, more than three times its estimated worth. In the very next lot, someone shelled out $5,676.25 for an off-white 6.5 Sub-Mariner #17 (in which Namor struggles with the Japanese fleet) even though Overstreet pegs an 8.0 copy of the same book at just $1,158. ""Absolutely insane!"" podboy66 wrote the day after the sale in the Collector’s Society forums, a common online hangout for comics buyers. ""I paid $450 for my Subby 17 in 6.0."" ""What’s up with some of these buyers anyway?"" Agent 007 asked. ""Makes you wonder if it’s simply a case of bidding fever."" Whoever was after the Sub-Mariners and All Star Comics at the Heritage Auction wasn’t a collector. Their bids were too erratic, they didn’t know the market, and chances were, they weren’t terribly smart. It was also clear that they had a lot of money on their hands — too much money, maybe — and they were eager to spend it. Through months of interviews and hundreds of pages of public documents, The Verge reconstructed what they were seeing: a multi-million-dollar embezzlement scheme that would ensnare a crooked lawyer, a multinational corporation, and some of the most sought-out comics in the world. In 2004, Anthony Chiofalo had nearly 20 years of corporate law behind him and a political career in his future. Married with two sons, Chiofalo was squat, clean-cut, and brusque. He’d spent his formative years in the Bronx, and when an assembly district seat opened up in the area, he decided to make a run. ""He was pretty determined,"" says Joe Thompson, a Bronx community activist who also ran in the election. But running as a Republican in the heavily Democratic Bronx was hopeless, and Chiofalo lost badly, pulling a little more than 30 percent of the vote. Thompson can’t remember seeing Chiofalo around the community much after that. The failed campaign marked a turning point in Chiofalo’s life — a defeat that precipitated a gradual unraveling. According to state records, his wife served him with divorce papers in August of 2005, followed by an order of protection. Chiofalo broke the order within a few months, and by the next year he was writing notes that would later be described as ""hostile, obscene, and derogatory,"" sending them to his wife, to the children’s guardian — even to a clerk for the judge presiding over the divorce case. Chiofalo eventually sued his wife and about 30 others involved in the divorce proceedings, alleging that they had infringed on his civil rights. The argument was thrown out in court. By 2008, the state court’s disciplinary committee decided to take action against Chiofalo, on the basis that his letters and frivolous lawsuits proved him unfit to be a lawyer. A letter from a psychiatrist quoted during Chiofalo’s disbarment proceeding said he experienced ""trends of grandiosity and episodic impulsivity and poor judgment""; that he would ""regress at times of stress and duress, particularly around financial, legal, and family issues."" When he did, ""his narcissistic defenses come to fore, often to his detriment."" One of the dozens of individuals involved in Chiofalo’s civil rights lawsuit put it even more simply: ""He’s a whack job. Bad news."" If there was one bright spot in his life during that time, it was Susan, a university health professor living in Texas. (Susan requested her maiden name not be used in this piece.) The two had been high school sweethearts and reconnected during Chiofalo’s divorce. In 2007, Susan invited Chiofalo to join her in Texas. Eventually, they moved into a cozy rental at 5802 Oakmoss Trail, in Spring, Texas — a small, green piece of the Houston metropolitan area, with wide open spaces and a population of about 50,000. By 2010, the two were married. Chiofalo seemed to have left his problems behind — he found a new job as in-house counsel for a Japanese construction company called Tadano, a gig that came with a $110,000 salary and new responsibility. Disciplinary Committee records show he lobbied to keep his New York law license, saying that he was seeking psychiatric help, but in October 2010, he was suspended from practicing law in the state for two years. It was around this time that Chiofalo’s job at Tadano hit a snag. Tadano was the world leader in rough-terrain cranes, selling huge tank-treaded trucks capable of lifting 160 tons to construction companies from London to Dubai. That globe-spanning business came with a river of legal work, and Chiofalo’s job was to coordinate local firms hired by Tadano, drawing up contracts, reviewing service agreements, and approving payments. But in the months after Chiofalo came on board, Tadano seemed to be involved in more and more litigation. In March of 2012, the company ordered an investigation into the spike in legal costs. ""Our approach initially was trying to ask exactly what went on, and then immediately trace the money flow,"" says Philip Hilder, a lawyer for Tadano. An employee eventually came across an expenditure that looked off. The bill was from Seidner & Virdone, LLP — a business supposedly located at 5802 Oakmoss Trail. According to a Tadano lawsuit later filed against Chiofalo’s wife, the company only existed in New York — it was the firm Chiofalo retained to work on his divorce proceedings. Another company Chiofalo submitted invoices from wasn’t real at all. Tadano alleged it was requesting payments be sent to the address on Oakmoss Trail — the firm’s manager and registered agent was Anthony Chiofalo. Chiofalo had created a byzantine structure of revolving transfers to conceal his tracks, laundering money through bank accounts, third-party payments, and the purchase of collectibles. Tadano alleged that in one particularly daring trick, he sent a retainer letter to the company requesting $15,000 for an attorney. The ""attorney"" was Chiofalo’s landlord. Tadano had cut a check that paid six months of rent. Tadano assessed the damage, adding up all the suspicious checks that had flown from the company’s accounts to each of Chiofalo’s fronts. Nearly $9 million had vanished. Two months after the start of the investigation, a higher-up at Tadano approached Chiofalo, asking him to explain himself. Chiofalo produced records — spreadsheets, with billable hours — but the law firms listed would turn out to be fakes. Chiofalo told people he had enlisted the services of Michael Maio — whom he touted as a ""super lawyer,"" licensed with seven State Bars. But Maio never existed; he was no more than a resume, cobbled together from an East Coast lawyer’s accomplishments and a photograph of a West Coast lawyer. Maio was Chiofalo’s mother’s maiden name. But the company never had a chance to ask about all of the inconsistencies. The day after he was confronted, Chiofalo didn’t show up to work and stopped answering his phone. As soon as he knew he’d been caught, the lawyer disappeared. Where do you stash $9 million if you don’t want anyone to find it? Tadano hired a private investigator named Bryan Vaclavik to follow the money. A 15-year veteran of the Harris County District Attorney’s office, Vaclavik specialized in fraud cases. He discovered wire transfers from Chiofalo to a ""Heritage Auctions,"" and when investigators at Tadano checked the records for Chiofalo’s work phone, they found that he had been making regular contact with a local storage facility. On June 8th, the police arrived with a warrant to search seven climate-controlled units in Spring, Texas’ Four Seasons Self Storage facility. The compound sits on a flat, sunny stretch of concrete just a few miles west of Interstate 45. What they uncovered there was astonishing: The first unit was packed with sports memorabilia, signed helmets, and baseball cards. The second unit had a makeshift study space, full of furniture and books. The third unit had six framed Texas flags and a shadowbox arrangement of photographs of Mussolini, among the flood of other memorabilia. The fourth had more figurines, sports photographs, and paintings depicting scenes from the Bible and World War Two. The fifth unit was mostly baseball cards, along with photographs of Robert De Niro, Phil Jackson, and Mussolini. The sixth unit had statuettes of Batman, Iron Man, Conan the Barbarian, and, again, Mussolini. Then, in the seventh unit, there were the comics: nearly 50 boxes of them, drawn from every era and genre with seemingly no logic to the collection. The Monkees and Star Wars comic books  — worth a few dollars, if that — sat next to nine different early Detective Comics issues, a 1940 Batman #2, a Young Allies #1, and a specialty comic from the 1940 World’s Fair. A later search turned up a copy of Action Comics #1, where Superman makes his first appearance — one of the most coveted and expensive comic books of all time. Tadano’s money had been transformed, taken from legal bills and embezzled into merchandise. The haul was worth millions. Investigators weren’t convinced Chiofalo had spent all of that cash on his own. Tadano alleged that Chiofalo’s wife had been in on the scheme. Harris County DA investigator Dustin Deutsch called Susan a few weeks after Chiofalo disappeared. She said she didn’t know where her husband was and hadn’t seen him in a month. Through what Deutsch described as an anonymous tip, he discovered she had a one-way plane ticket to New York leaving the following day. Was she flying back to meet her husband in the Bronx? He rushed to get a warrant and searched the Chiofalo home the same day. The home resembled an extension of the storage unit: it was ""overrun with stacks and piles of boxes and packages,"" addressed to one of Chiofalo’s fictitious companies, a civil complaint from Tadano would allege. ""The interior of their rental home was so crowded that it resembled a museum more than a residence."" Investigators said they found checks and other financial documents made out to Chiofalo, Susan, and the fictitious lawyer Maio, while ""forged invoices"" were found ""in clear view."" Together, Tadano would allege, the Chiofalos used the embezzled funds to buy a $48,000 Lexus, a $44,000 Toyota pickup, and a 10,000-square-foot home for $609,000 that they would remodel. One Chiofalo-linked cashier’s check for $21,000 had gone straight to a furniture store. The police moved to arrest Susan, with Chiofalo still on the run. (Susan filed for divorce the following month.) Chiofalo was charged in absentia with felony theft, with bail preemptively set at $18 million. Under the criminal complaint against him, the ""ARREST DATE"" section said simply, ""TO BE."" Like a famous painting, a rare comic is hard to fence. Only a handful of buyers in the US handle big-ticket sales, and most shops keep scans of every comic for simple safety reasons. Even the most pristine comics are unique, marked with subtle wrinkles, stains, and clouds of mold known as ""foxing."" Those marks make it easy to follow a single comic as it moves from sale to sale. ""It’s almost like fingerprints,"" says Buddy Saunders, who operates Lone Star Comics in Dallas. ""If it shows up on eBay and it was stolen from us, we know."" Big auction sites do the same, in part because of return fraud, in which a scammer will purchase a valuable comic and try to return a forgery. If the wrinkles don’t match the scan, the buyer is in serious trouble. In recent years, a business called the Certified Guaranty Company (or CGC) has made fraud even harder. If you bought a comic book from an auction house within the last decade, it probably came in one of CGC’s distinctive plastic shells, complete with a two-digit condition rating, a serial number, and a hologram for authentication. The shells make it impossible to read the comic (critics call them ""plastic coffins""), but they offer strong protections against damage and theft. Barcodes make for easy tracking, and ""de-slabbing"" a comic will make almost any buyer suspicious. If that buyer wants to look the comic up, it’s easy to find recent sales in an auction site’s database. If officials were going to use comics to catch and prosecute Chiofalo, investigators needed to know which comics he had taken with him, and which he had left behind — a task that fell to DA investigator Dustin Deutsch. Deutsch’s specialty was evidence: he taught forensics classes at a nearby community college, and his cases made him a regular on the local TV news. His team spent a full week at the sprawling storage complex, cataloging more than 3,600 separate items. Some of the haul entered into evidence as whole boxes, as if the investigators had simply given up on counting it all. Locked away in one of the storage units Deutsch was searching was an All Star #3  — the one that had cost Chiofalo $200,000. Somehow, that comic never made it onto the evidence list. No one noticed the omission. By the time the investigators closed the doors on the storage units at the end of the week, the comic wasn’t there. It was missing, along with an All Winners #1 and a box of other titles that had mysteriously dropped off the list. On August 11th, 2012 — three months after Chiofalo vanished — a man named Lonnie Blevins walked into Wizard World’s Chicago Comic Convention looking to unload a box of comics. He worked with Deutsch as a DA investigator in Harris County, sporting the same tight-cropped haircut and square build as his colleague. He was part of the team sorting through Chiofalo’s storage units, although it would be another two weeks before they turned in their official report. But today, he was at the con on personal business. Every year, Chicago Comic-Con takes over the the Donald E. Stephens Convention Center, a stadium-sized concrete box sandwiched between airport hotels on the northwest outskirts of Chicago. This was the third day. William Shatner and Stan Lee made appearances, along with the world’s largest playable Pac Man machine. But for comics, the real action was in the booths, where buyers came from across the country to check out any interesting books that might be for sale. Blevins brought with him a full box of loose comics, none of them in CGC slabs. Some of his comics were real gems, like an All Star #3 and an All Winners #1, but the box was all over the map in terms of condition and quality. Without slabs, buyers were suspicious, but he reassured them. He was a cop back in Texas — he showed them his badge, and let them scan it in case they needed to find him later. Besides, how often do you see an All Star #3, let alone an unslabbed one? The Flash! The Green Lantern! Johnny Thunder! Dr. Fate! It was a rare book and an expensive one, too: after all, just a few months earlier, an All Star #3 had sold for $200,000 in a private Heritage sale. There was some light foxing — a cloud of mold toward the bottom of the front cover — but otherwise it was in good condition: an 8.0 or even an 8.5 by the look of it. In retrospect, maybe buying such a big title without a CGC box was asking for trouble. ""It was very strange,"" one of the buyers remembered later. ""Nobody would crack that book out and sell it raw."" But the book was going cheap. Maybe Blevins just didn’t know what he had. Sometimes you just get lucky. Blevins left the con with $30,000 in cash and another $40,000 split between nine checks. The investigator said he was going through a nasty divorce, and was worried his ex-wife might raise trouble over any checks for more than $10,000. But what about that foxing? When the buyers took their comics home, they noticed something strange: the All Star #3 that had sold in February had the same imperfections. In fact, it was the same book. But that book was slabbed — it had a barcode and provenance, sold to a private buyer who wouldn’t have deslabbed it without a reason. Had they bought stolen property? It was worse. They had bought stolen evidence. The book had come direct from Chiofalo’s storage unit, smuggled out under the nose of the Harris County DA — and according to prosecutors, Blevins and Deutsch worked together to smuggle them out. More than $150,000 in comics had disappeared from the storage unit, and Blevins had spent the summer selling them at comics conventions across the country. The books were deslabbed to throw investigators off the trail, but even without the barcode, the cover gave it away. Collectors search for flawless comics, but it’s the imperfections that give them an identity, and this imperfection placed Blevins at the scene of a crime. Meanwhile, Chiofalo spent the summer on the run. Months went by, and leads dried up. He had taken hundreds of thousands of dollars with him — with that much money, maybe he never needed to come back. And then, one day in December 2012, just after 2PM, a man in a black sweatshirt walked into the police headquarters of Newport, Rhode Island, carrying a large black suitcase. He told an officer at the counter that there was a warrant out for his arrest. Police ran a search: ""Chiofalo"" — wanted for aggravated larceny in the state of Texas. He had been on the run for seven months. He told officers that he was carrying cash, although ""he wasn’t sure about the amount of money he had,"" Lt. William Fitzgerald told The Verge. $100,000? $125,000? He was arrested, booked, sent to Cell No. 1, and had his possessions processed: a Rolex watch, two cellphones, a laptop, a bag, and the suitcase. In the bag, they found $55,000. In the suitcase, $95,000. Chiofalo was eventually extradited back to Texas, but in the seven months since he’d fled, the case against him had gone to shambles. Evidence had gone missing, one of the investigators was under federal indictment, and a special prosecutor had to be brought in to press the case impartially. When Chiofalo appeared in court, he looked haggard, barely recognizable as the fresh-faced lawyer who had run for office 10 years earlier. Under his orange jumpsuit, intricate sleeve tattoos ran down both his forearms. His lawyer blamed the DA’s evidence thefts for trial delays, and pushed for reduced bail. It was hard to disagree. After the hearing, Chiofalo’s bail was reduced from $18 million to just $150,000. Eager to avoid trial, the prosecution arranged a plea deal, and in May 2014, a Harris County Court judge sentenced Chiofalo to 40 years in prison, up for parole in about eight. According to reports, he would’ve had a better deal, but decided against giving up millions that are still unaccounted for. Caught red-handed, Lonnie Blevins plead guilty to federal charges of evidence tampering. Deutsch quit the DA’s office as soon as the charges came down, and is currently standing trial for felony theft and tampering with evidence. The DA put 125 cases the officers had worked on under re-examination.   Then there are the comics. The three Chicago buyers, having purchased stolen goods, are now out $70,000. (""It was a bad and expensive experience,"" one buyer told The Verge. ""That is all I will say."") Tadano retrieved most of the material from the storage facilities and sold them back through the same auction houses where Chiofalo had first bought them. The only exception were comics like All Star #3, which had been sold by Blevins and were kept for evidence in Deutsch’s trial. Susan had the charges against her dropped for lack of evidence and her criminal records expunged. The civil lawsuit, Susan wrote in an email, ""was merely a legal formality, designed so I could sign over to Tadano all the property acquired post-marriage; and for intimidation purposes. As I recall, there is quite a bit of embellishment in the narrative."" In correspondence, Susan was eager to close that chapter of her life. ""He left a trail of destruction in his path and caused a great deal of pain and suffering to all his loved ones,"" Susan said. The experience left her with what she called ""lifelong PTSD-related scars."" It can’t be said if Chiofalo, Deutsch, or Blevins ever read All Star #3, but if they did, they might have read a tale about a daring heist, foiled by the chapter’s hero, The Atom. In his earliest appearances, The Atom wears a wrestling corset and yellow leotard, armed with no superpowers except a strong sense of morality. In the story, soldiers are transporting a stockpile of government gold to a vault when they’re intercepted by a group of gangsters packing Tommy guns. The gangsters overpower the soldiers, disguising themselves in the stolen uniforms, and drive into the government compound. The guards greet them, and in one small, single panel, guards and crooks are framed together. Dressed the same, their faces void of definition, it’s impossible to tell them apart. * * A note on sourcing: This piece was researched over six months, with public records confirmed by subject interviews wherever possible. The bulk of the information was drawn from court records, particularly the criminal cases against Blevins and Deutsch, as well as the criminal and civil cases against Chiofalo on the civil case against his wife. We also drew from the New York State Departmental Disciplinary Committee’s action against Chiofalo, which resulted in his temporary disbarment in that state. Where warranted, we have removed the names of parties involved so as not to inflict further harm. * * Design by Dylan Lathrop Edited by Michael Zelenko ",0.5180969598635815,0.4819030401364185,0.8691582450923111,3938,4.9144235652615542,1669,6.5236668663870585,0,24,,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Apps like Periscope and Snapchat have embraced vertical footage and now YouTube is recognizing its worth too, fixing the way it shows full-screen vertical videos in its Android app. Instead of uselessly rotating the footage 90 degrees when you click full-screen, YouTube now actually expands the video to fill your phone or tablet's display.

A new project from Atlas Obscura's Richard Kreitner and Steven Melendez painstakingly charts and captions every stop on 12 different classics of American road-trip literature. The resultant interactive map is a thing of wonder. Let me explain my excitement — the road-trip is the one truly lovable, completely pure thing about American culture. Whatever else makes us gross and bad, our landscapes are beautiful, and our kitsch is the best in the world, and you can't fault anyone for wanting to see as much of it as possible. But no one has time to go on 12 road-trips a year. Enter: books and pop music. You can follow Mark Twain's pre-railroad, transcontinental trip in Roughing It (which is, admittedly, a road-trip exclusive to off-roads); the freewheeling, freebasing classic On the Road; and — the only example of a female-narrated experience on the map — the more recent journey of Cheryl Strayed in Wild (again, more of a trail-trip). One classic, however, is missing: Lolita. Kreitner proactively defends himself saying, ""Lolita's road-trip passages are scattered and defiant of cartographical order."" The road trip is the most lovable thing about America I set out last night to test his theory that Lolita wasn't suited to a project of this sort, because I had to, because Lolita is the greatest novel ever written by a person who once taught at my alma mater and whose work was ruthlessly shoved down my throat. You could say I hit a road block: Roughly, during that mad year (August 1947 to August 1948), our route began with a series of wiggles and whorls in New England, then meandered south, up and down, east and west; dipped deep into ce qu'on appelle Dixieland, avoided Florida because the Farlows were there, veered west, zigzagged through corn belts and cotton belts; crossed and recrossed the Rockies, straggled through southern deserts where we wintered; reached the Pacific, turned north through the pale lilac fluff of flowering shrubs along forest roads; almost reached the Canadian border; and proceeded east, across good lands and bad lands, back to agriculture on a grand scale, avoiding, despite little Lo's strident remonstrations, little Lo's birthplace, in a corn, coal and hog producing area; and finally returned to the fold of the East, petering out in the college town of Beardsley. No, Beardsley College is not a real place. So, what Kreitner says is true, and is in fact, a signature characteristic of the novel. Humbert Humbert, even in his best efforts to come clean, often trolls the jury with vague statements and flowery overtures. If you're really interested in a best approximation of his journey, this blogger sure dedicated 8 to 10 years of his or her life to that.

Part of that success — and what Uber makes headlines for — comes from its ruthless playbook to frustrate the competition and to invade any market it wants, even if it's facing a government-protected taxi monopoly. Less glamorous but no less important: Uber appears to be completely dominating local politicians who get in its way. A report from The Washington Post sheds some light on the scope of Uber's political advocacy wing. According to the Post, local lobbying registration records indicate the company hired private lobbyists in at least 50 US cities and states and has hired at least 161 people to lobby for its interests. In Sacramento alone, Uber spent $475,000 over five months to influence California lawmakers, the Post reports. Uber shut down one state regulator within 48 hours In many cases, Uber used common political advocacy tactics to generate public support for its business. The company has sent out notices to its users in markets where regulation threatens its operation, asking them to contact local politicians. In one instance in June, The Washington Post reports, Uber was able to provoke hundreds of people in Virginia to complain to the Department of Motor Vehicles commissioner responsible for shutting its business down. Then, it sent its team of lobbyists to meet with aides of Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe. Within 48 hours, the Post reports, Virginia's transportation secretary told the DMV to leave Uber drivers alone — meaning the company was successfully able to leapfrog regulators. So far, that influence has attracted some bipartisan interest from Democratic and Republican politicians, including the chairman of the Republican National Committee, and President Obama's former campaign manager David Plouffe who now leads Uber's political arm. As the Post reports, Uber, like other highly profitable public utilities, has been courting both major parties; the Post says the company has rapidly hired a team of former gubernatorial aides, former state legislators, and other political elites. Uber's attention for its explosive success has been matched by criticism of its aggressive and often off-putting startup culture. In November, Uber executive Emil Michael was caught at a dinner meeting casually threatening a journalist with a smear campaign. In response, Uber CEO Travis Kalanick insisted that Michael's comments represented ""a departure from our values and ideals,"" and said that the company ""should tell the stories of progress and appeal to people's hearts and minds."" In the meantime, Kalanick's political captain is responsible for reconciling Uber's stories of progress with the company's dubious image. ""We have to correct it,"" Plouffe told the Post. ""Part of this is just when you're maturing and growing, you're going to make mistakes."" Those mistakes may have cost Uber some respect, but they haven't appeared to slow its political conquest.",0.7232045590905025,0.2767954409094975,0.9023376770791866,484,5.3491735537190079,303,6.3168316831683171,0,0,"Policy & Law, Transportation, US & World",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

The project takes the main idea from Land Rover's original ""Transparent Bonnet"" concept — which uses cameras mounted on the grille to capture and relay video to a heads-up display in the windscreen, essentially making the car's hood appear semi-transparent to the driver — and expands it to the blind spot-causing pillars between car windows.

In addition to the blind-spot technology, Jaguar Land Rover is teasing a few additional ideas with respect to augmented reality on the windscreen.

The news comes as three taxi unions blocked major highways around Paris in protest against Uber and the ""unfair competition"" it poses. On Friday, a French court ruled that UberPop could continue to operate within Paris — a decision that sparked today's taxi strike — but the interior ministry today said the service will be banned nationwide in accordance with new regulations that go into effect next year. At issue is the fact that UberPop drivers are not required to hold professional licenses or insurance, as other French chauffeurs are. A law that goes into effect on January 1st strengthens these requirements, with violators facing two years in prison and a €300,000 fine. In a televised interview this morning, ministry spokesperson Pierre-Henry Brandet said UberPop and its unlicensed drivers poses risks to customers. ""for the consumer, it's a real danger."" ""Currently, those who use UberPop are not protected in case of an accident,"" Brandet said. ""So not only is it illegal to offer the service, but for the consumer, it's a real danger."" For its part, Uber says it will continue to operate UberPop in France until a court determines otherwise. ""The recent decision by the Commercial Court in Paris is the first and only decision rendered on the Thévenoud Law and the court's decision was to allow UberPop to continue operating,"" a company spokesperson said in an email statement. ""Uber remains committed to innovating and offering innovative transport solutions — including UberPop — that are safe, reliable and affordable in 2015. Uber is part of the solution, not part of the problem."" ""As of today the product is live, it's not been banned, and I don't see anything changing on January 1st,"" Pierre-Dimitri Gore-Coty, Uber’s general manager for Western Europe, said in a phone interview. He added that it's up to the courts to determine whether the new laws apply to UberPop and cited Friday's decision as an encouraging sign for the company. The president of the French Taxi Association acknowledged to the New York Times that it remains unclear whether the new laws will be applied to UberPop, but Brandet, speaking to French TV station BFMTV, said an earlier court ruling had ""well demonstrated the illegal nature of the service."" Uber has faced stiff resistance from French taxi unions since it launched in the country three years ago. A protest earlier this year turned violent as Uber drivers clashed with union members, and a French court in October fined the company more than $120,000 for deceptive advertising. Today's announcement comes as Uber faces mounting pressure in India, where a driver allegedly raped a female passenger last week, as well as bans in Spain and the Netherlands.

They never have been. So you’d think taking feedback from thousands of customers and using that input to reinvent the in-car user experience would be a good idea. That’s just what Ford claims it’s done with Sync 3, the third generation of its connected infotainment platform that's being announced today. Sync 3 will start appearing in 2016 model cars. Ford says over 22,000 customer comments and suggestions helped steer its mission to improve upon Sync, which lets consumers place hands-free calls and texts, get turn-by-turn directions, and interact with smartphone apps while driving.    Striking harmony between your phone and car is something every auto manufacturer is pursuing; after all, over 80 percent of Ford customers are now carrying smartphones. Raj Nair, Ford’s CTO of global product development, said the company went out of its way to understand what customers are looking for. ""It’s more research than we’ve ever done for any vehicle line, any product, any feature in our history,"" he said. But Sync 3 isn’t some grand reimagining of your vehicle’s dashboard. If anything, it feels like Ford reined in its ambitions in favor of delivering a simplified system that’s destined to be used up and down its vehicle lineup. ""It’s more intuitive because we’ve actually reduced the amount of information on the home screen,"" said Nair, pointing to larger fonts and bigger touch zones that make for easier targets when driving. Sync 3’s got a brighter background color that won’t look as washed out in the sun, and menus are pretty basic — by design. Underneath, Sync 3 is running new, BlackBerry QNX-based software that's a total departure from the work Ford and Microsoft had done together previously. That relationship is over, and Nair described this as ""pretty much an all new platform."" There’s also faster TI hardware powering the system along. ""We benchmarked smartphone and tablet response times, and made sure we had the hardware capability to deliver on those type of customer expectations,"" Nair said.    Ford is emphasizing a few features in particular. First, the whole system is more closely modeled after a smartphone, and it starts with touch. The automaker has finally made the transition to capacitive touchscreens — years after electronics companies — and so the Sync 3 hardware registered even my lightest taps without any problems. It’s 2014, so Ford doesn’t really deserve any congratulations for finally adding support for swipe gestures and pinch-to-zoom in maps. But the company should get praise for improvements to the 911 Assist system in Sync 3, which can now tell emergency personnel which seat belts were in use during an accident and provide more specifics on the type of crash (front impact, side crash, rollover, etc.) Software updates will also come easier, since every car leaving the production line with Sync 3 will have a Wi-Fi receiver built in. You can configure the car to connect to your home network from the garage, and a few times each month, Sync 3 will automatically ping Ford’s servers and pull down available updates. Say goodbye to annoying dealership visits and the fingers-crossed method of loading new software at home with a USB stick. Your car can update its own software from the garage or driveway The smartphone influence carries down to voice search, which is now more conversational and far less strict about the commands it will accept. You can say ""ten twenty five Main Street"" instead of ""one zero two five Main Street,"" for example. Ford has also anchored a dock-like shortcut bar to the bottom of the screen that always remains visible. From here you can jump between music controls, climate preferences, turn-by-turn navigation, and Ford’s AppLink, which is what connects with compatible apps on your phone like Spotify, Pandora, and NPR One. Sync 3 automatically discovers AppLink-supported apps on your paired smartphone and displays them on screen. As a whole, the menus are mostly inoffensive, occasionally ugly, but always pretty uninspired. ""The flat style is very in right now,"" one of Ford's engineers told me when I asked about the company's design philosophy, explaining that the automaker's preference is to keep things familiar. This is software that has to be understood by millions of drivers. Everything needs to be dead-obvious since people will be interacting with it while at the helm of a fast-moving car. From that view, sticking to simplicity and plain-looking buttons makes sense. If you're not keen on the bright style, there's also a dark mode that can be switched on or automatically enabled at night.  But there are some questionable design choices. Sync 3 supports Siri Eyes-Free, but Ford’s representatives told me that Apple (oddly) won’t let the company make an icon to go along with its iOS assistant. Instead, we’re left with a totally blank, featureless button to activate it. (At least make the ""Siri"" text bigger or something.) It feels like an afterthought, even if it's out of Ford's control. Right now, nothing about Sync 3 feels modern or novel from a design perspective — especially when compared to the in-car solutions from Apple and Google. It's no doubt a refinement over what came before, yet I never said ""wow"" in response to any of Sync 3’s feature demonstrations. The bar's being raised, but it's Silicon Valley doing the innovating rather than anyone in Detroit. A faceless Siri feels like an afterthought Third-party developers involved with AppLink can change how things look to some degree, but they can’t wipe away Ford’s visual style completely. Pandora can show album art or create icons to give any track a thumbs up or thumbs down, but ultimately it'll always look like other apps running on Ford’s platform. Again, that’s done by design to maintain consistency and user friendliness, but Ford has some serious work to do if it ever hopes to match the elegance of Apple’s CarPlay or Android Auto. Speaking of which, Ford wouldn’t say when consumers can expect to start using CarPlay and Android Auto in its cars. The company’s reps only reiterated that Ford has pledged to support both, but offered no firm dates or information on whether Sync 3 cars would be upgraded for compatibility. Carmakers (Ford included) seem hesitant to let CarPlay or Android Auto take full ownership of their infotainment systems. They cite missing features like AM radio as a reason to maintain their own presence and put distance between Apple (or Google) and the driver. ""If you're a terrestrial radio listener, you're going to have to bounce in and out of that experience to do that,"" Ford's Gary Jablonski told me. So the only real option is to shoehorn those radically different software experiences into Sync — without confusing people. That sounds like quite a challenge, and Jablonski admitted as much. But it's a challenge for later. Right now, what we're left with in Sync 3 is a modest improvement over what came before. Ford has made a number of improvements to make its infotainment platform a bit smarter, faster, and easier to use. The company isn't yet saying which vehicle will get Sync 3 first, but Raj Nair said Ford is intent on keeping Sync ""a mainstream option"" available in a wide selection of cars from the Fiesta up through Lincoln's lineup. Sync 3 won't blow you away, and it still struggles with some longstanding pain points like inputting a New York City address for directions. But if the goal was to make Sync 3 more usable and smartphone-like than its predecessors, Ford's definitely made some progress. No one's going to mistake Sync 3 for something that came from Cupertino or Mountain View. Ford's design just isn't on the same level, and it's readily apparent that a car company made this. But it's at least one step in the right direction, and maybe a step is the best we can ask for at this point.",0.5102290789472337,0.4897709210527663,0.17580513536003295,1339,5.0224047796863331,698,6.3352435530085964,0,47,"Tech, Transportation, Hands-on",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

He reacted by turning his wheel toward the guardrail, avoiding the surrounding cars and oncoming traffic.   The situation could have played out in many different ways that afternoon. The couple could’ve been among the more than 41,000 people to lose their lives to car crashes in the US that year in 2007. Instead, they walked away with only a couple of bruises. Today, they’re married and have a four-month-old son.  Pye credits his good fortune in large part to a driving simulator. “Driving on the simulator at my high school taught me to keep calm and think clearly in stressful situations,” he says.   Most schools around the country aren’t teaching any driving education, but the ones that do are teaching it based on a several-decades-old model. One man from Georgia has been trying to change that for over a decade. Following the death of Alan Brown’s 17-year-old son Joshua in July 2003, he architected and lobbied for a piece of legislation known as “Joshua’s Law.” Brown’s son, Joshua Brown, hydroplaned driving on the highway in the rain at 40 miles per hour and hit a tree. “Practically nothing” was offered to help train his son deal with these kinds of driving conditions, says the senior Brown, chairman of the Joshua Brown Foundation. “With simulation, teens can have that same crash over and over until they know exactly what to do.” In Joshua Brown’s case, such training may have meant knowing not to go 40 miles an hour in heavy rain. In Pye’s case, it was learning skid control and how to quickly maneuver the steering wheel when things go wrong.   Following the death of his son and the implementation of Joshua’s Law in 2005 in Georgia, Brown had placed six driving simulators at Cartersville High School, where Pye attended, which was the first high school in the state to receive them. Today, there are thousands of simulators in high schools around the state.    Virtual Driver Interactive/VDI  Before Joshua’s Law, high schools in Georgia were not providing driver’s education, Brown says. Out of 416 Georgia high schools at the time, only nine were offering Driver's Ed. They were using a program created in the early 1950s, Brown says, which is reflective of driving programs nationwide. Since then, cars have gotten faster. There are exponentially more cars on the road. Technological distractions from Snapchat to Google Maps are endless, and yet for most high school students across America, driving education hasn’t evolved. Joshua’s Law raises traffic violation penalties by 5 percent, providing funding for placement of ""modern"" driver’s education in Georgia high schools. This new driver’s education consists of five elements: simulation, an interactive and engaging curriculum, hazard recognition, parental involvement, and behind-the-wheel training. ""I believe simulation and the modern driving education that I had at my high school helped to save my life."" ""I believe simulation and the modern driving education that I had at my high school helped to save my life, giving me more confidence behind the wheel – every state should use it,"" Pye says, reflecting on the afternoon of his crash. Driving simulators can take several forms. For commercial use, one of the more popular versions is a portable desktop model, which is usually set up at home, school, or work at a desk, costing around $7,000. It’s fitted with a steering wheel and a wide monitor, along with gas and break pedals. A more expensive type is the full cab model, costing between $10,000 to $20,000, which looks like the driver’s side of a car and includes real car parts down to the ignition key. ""Simulators mimic a real car down to the gas and break pedals, signals, windshield wipers, and ignition key,"" explains Steve Mochel, president of Connecticut-based Fresh Green Light, a driving program that supplements traditional training with heavy use of driving simulation.   Driving simulators replicate actual driving experiences through all types of scenarios that include vehicle handling, scanning and hazard detection, parallel parking, and hydroplaning. Other situations include distracted and impaired driving. It will simulate driving during different times of day and during various weather conditions, for example, giving tips like better scanning through visual and verbal instruction. On a modern driver simulator, there are up to 300 different scenarios simulated that teach the range of cognitive skills needed to deal with complex roadway and traffic conditions, including situation awareness, hazard perception, decision making under time pressure, and general defensive driving techniques, according to Mochel. These techniques contrast with traditional driver’s education, which is at the whim of whatever weather and traffic conditions prevail at the time of driving. The stats are hard to ignore. Driving simulators were placed in 147 Georgia high schools between 2005 and 2007, funded with money from Joshua’s Law. Since the simulators and updated driving program were implemented, there has been a statewide decline in teen auto fatalities of around 60 percent or 181 student lives a year, according to Brown and data compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Georgia Governor’s Office of Highway Safety. In Gwinnett County, one of the most populated counties in Georgia, teen fatalities in cars have fallen from 23 in 2006 to only five in 2011, according to research by Atlanta-based Kennesaw State University. Research in other parts of the country reflects similar findings. In January 2013, a researcher at Wright State University in Dayton, Ohio, showed a statistically significant reduction in the number of car crashes among local high school students who had taken part in virtual simulation. Over six-month and one-year periods, researcher Peter Ekeh compared a group of student drivers who used simulators to supplement on the road driving to a control group of students who didn’t use any simulation. His research found that the group of students who incorporated simulator training had significantly less driving infractions and no car crashes over both time periods, while more than one-quarter of the control group experienced car crashes after one year. Virtual Driver Interactive/VDI  Pye is now a US Marine and a graduate from the United States Naval Academy. He notes that throughout his undergrad career and even in his current job he has been exposed to simulation as a form of training to fly a plane, drive a ship, and coordinate shooting of missiles, cannons, and artillery. ""The military uses a lot of simulation because it’s more cost-effective, and it gives people an opportunity to mess up and prevent injury,"" he says. Captain Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger, who guided his US Airways airliner to safety in New York’s Hudson River in January 2009, saving all aboard, echoes that sentiment. He says that repeated flight training through simulation gave him the ""creative reserve"" to think outside of the box. It allowed him to land on the water when no other option was possible at the time. ""Flight simulator training and team building helped give us the foundation to solve that problem in 208 seconds,"" he says. Pilots are required to practice simulator training every 9-12 months to prepare for rain, snow, ice, fog, wind, and other types of inclement weather, along with emergencies like engine and hydraulic failures. ""Simulators give pilots the opportunity to repeatedly practice and become expert at handling situations that rarely occur on actual flights, so when they are suddenly confronted with an inflight emergency, it will not be the first time they have seen such a challenge,"" he explains. But when it comes to driving, simulation has not entered the mainstream of driving education, even though traffic crashes are the number one killer of teens in America with around 3,000 deaths per year, according to the CDC. To put the numbers in perspective, around 4,500 American soldiers were killed in the Iraq War between 2003 and 2012, according to iCasualties.org, which tracks deaths and injuries among coalition forces in Iraq and Afghanistan. During the same time period, more than 43,000 teenagers in America died in car crashes, data from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety shows. ""As a society we need to be doing a much better job in driver education. What we’re doing now is a joke,"" says Sullenberger. ""If the number of people lost from car crashes were lost from flying, it would equate to an airliner crashing nearly every day with no survivors. We wouldn’t accept that in aviation. But as a society we accept it with driving."" ""If the number of people lost from car crashes were lost from flying, it would equate to an airliner crashing nearly every day with no survivors."" Some private companies across the US have slowly begun implementing driving simulation, too. UPS, for example, has been using a training simulator to supplement its driver safety training, and the results have been positive. When UPS first had the idea to incorporate simulators into its driver training program, it turned to Sacramento-based Virtual Driver Interactive, a company UPS has worked with over the last year to provide simulator training for employees at various UPS divisions on a rotational basis. The training is broken down into sections with each module focusing on a particular safety issue, with the entire virtual program for UPS taking about an hour. ""From July 2013 to April of this year when we implemented the simulators in our facility, we saw a 38% reduction in crashes,"" says Rodney Ruff, division manager for UPS in Brooklyn, New York. Since the end of April, the simulators were transferred from the Brooklyn division to the division in Albany. The percent of crashes for the Brooklyn location immediately flat-lined, and the Albany office had crashes decrease by about 50%. VDI All this comes as cars are getting smarter, though: many modern models have collision-sensing features that can help avoid crashes entirely, and self-driving technologies are around the corner. Is better driver’s education really necessary? ""Anybody who thinks that we’ll all be in self-driving cars in 10 years is excited by technology but isn’t practical,"" says Bob Davis, CEO of Virtual Driver Interactive, a company he founded to help teenagers become safer drivers through simulation training. ""There aren’t many safety professionals who think that the software will be ‘bulletproof’ in terms of liability in all situations anytime soon."" Commercial plane ""auto pilot"" settings have not replaced the need for training pilots, nor will self-driving cars eliminate the need for judgment and training, but researchers say it can and will help with many specific situations. Even the slightest manufacturing defects result in hundreds of millions of dollars in legal fines, Davis says. ""No one will want to take on the liability of self-driving cars for a really long time … maybe my teenagers’ kids’ kids will have to worry about it."" No simulator will replicate hours of experience in a car. However, if they’re used to supplement actual driving with everyday scenarios as well as dangerous ones drivers ideally never encounter, simulators will provide practice and lessons to learn and can reduce accidents, says Davis. Meanwhile, many say the high cost of the technology is preventing it from catching on. A racing video game may only cost $50, but driving simulators come at a significantly higher cost: educational models can start at $7,000, while research models can run up to hundreds of thousands of dollars. Most states now seem to be content with using only public service announcements to affect driver safety, but simply putting up billboards and running campaigns not to text and drive is a poor substitute for actually supporting and funding driver education, says Davis. ""Simulators may have to show more widespread improvement in crash statistics before states require simulation in either health classes or driver’s education classes."" Incentives will also be needed for drivers to seek simulation technology and for training centers to incorporate them into their schools. If insurance companies promised a reduction in auto insurance premiums for people who have passed a series of simulation courses or received a credit for doing so, more people would take it seriously, one insurance executive says. Others note that for simulation to be adopted, states could mandate drivers get better training, which would increase costs for driver training but save lives in the long term. ""Safety pays for itself in all industries,"" says Sullenberger, giving the example that it’s less expensive to give superior hospital primary care as opposed to rushing care and then needing to readmit patients. Dr. Flaura Winston, a public health researcher at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, predicts that implementing simulators in schools across America and in driver education more broadly could ""significantly"" reduce car accidents if integrated appropriately into driver's ed curriculum. ""Crashes are the leading cause of death for adolescents,"" she says, ""and they should be treated as a health problem."" ""Safety pays for itself in all industries."" In the end, simulators should not be used as a scare tactic, researchers and educators say, but to see deficits in driver behavior, address them and supplement existing training, making roads across America safer for everyone. ""The good thing about simulation is that there’s always a restart button,"" Pye says. Correction: The article originally suggested Dr. Flaura Winston had said that simulators could lead to a ""double-digit"" decline in car accidents, but the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia says that there isn't sufficient research yet to directly quantify the benefit. The text has been changed to say that a correctly integrated simulator could reduce car accidents ""significantly.""

Whether you’re talking lifestyles or hairstyles, California was at the leading edge of an adventurous spirit that embraced the unconventional and the new. One of the unappreciated projects of that era was the Art and Technology Program set up by the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA) in 1967. Emulating an earlier Experiments in Art and Technology venture in New York, it paired visionary artists with resourceful engineers in a collaborative environment where person-to-person communication was valued higher than a formal development process. LACMA's extensive report on the project documents the wild concepts proposed by the artists and the various approaches that were taken to realizing them. They spanned everything from 5,600-cubic-meter installations to sensory deprivation to Jean Dupuy's Sparks proposal, which wanted to express the spoken word as electrical sparks upon a metal canvas. Unfortunately, most of these ideas never reached fruition and the high failure rate led to the program's demise in 1971, but its influence is still being felt today, not least in a revival of the project that LACMA is launching this month. ""We are not looking for the next great museum guide app."" The new Art + Technology Lab will reprise the founding principles of the original project, bringing artists and technologists together to explore new applications for emerging tech, but it will do a number of things differently. The main change, says LACMA’s Amy Heibel, is about openness. Whereas the initial four-year run saw the museum do the matchmaking behind the scenes, the new Lab is inviting artists and collectives to send in their own project proposals — there are no requirements or parameters for who can enter. You just need a good idea, ideally one that inspires and advances the dialogue about technology’s evolving relationship with culture.  Approved projects will get the benefit of up to $50,000 in funding, advice from a standout group of tech executives, and in-kind support from participating tech companies. The legacy of the original project has attracted big names to support the new Lab, with Accenture, Daqri, Nvidia, Google, and SpaceX all contributing the time of their staff and their facilities. Artists will have access to robotics, EEG, sensors, big data-crunching machines, and even SpaceX flight information, though the tech that will be available to them won’t be limited to the supporting companies. As such, LACMA is laying the foundation for people to explore their craziest ideas, with Heibel underlining the importance of ""impractical and creative applications of technology,"" saying that ""we’re not looking for the next great museum guide app."" Iterative proposals are also encouraged, where a discovery-and-definition phase can be factored into the design process — ""that can all happen under the same grant,"" assures Heibel. As the museum’s vice president for technology, web, and digital media, she’s heading up the task of identifying the most compelling proposals, only a few of which will get funded in the first year. The development of the project becomes art in its own right The second aspect of the new Lab’s openness will be about the visiting public. Heibel wants projects that people can get their hands on and experience. LACMA won’t wait for a finished article before exhibiting the work — it will treat the very process of designing and developing an idea as art in itself. What problems the artists are trying to solve, what technologies they're using, how they're relating to their subjects — all of these evolving aspects can be presented to the public before the work reaches a state of completion.  Chris DeFay, who works on human linguistic analytics at Google, is a member of the Art + Tech Lab’s advisory board and a passionate supporter of its goals. He wrote his doctoral dissertation on the subject of the original LACMA program, so when the museum sought Google’s aid with the new Lab, the response was to ""go talk to Chris, he’s always talking about that LACMA project."" Defay tells The Verge that the most important outcome of the original effort was the experience it gave to the participating artists and the way it informed their later work. Even if unfinished, he says, their projects gave them a new awareness of technology and engineering, with sculptor Richard Serra in particular benefiting from being able to ""experiment in a massive sandbox with very heavy toys."" LACMA’s Art + Tech Lab has a dedicated space within the museum’s newly remodeled Balch Art Research Library. Amy Heibel notes that this wouldn’t have been possible without the Los Angeles County’s support, whose Productivity Investment Fund got the new project off the ground. Still, she also points out that by virtue of its location in ""a part of the country that’s already a center of innovation"" and its prior pioneering efforts, LACMA is unique in being able to put together a project of this kind. ""Experiment in a massive sandbox with very heavy toys."" Among the notable alumni of the ‘60s Art and Technology Program are Andy Warhol, Claes Oldenburg, and James Turrell, the latter of whom is presently the subject of a career retrospective hosted at LACMA. Richard Serra saw his Five Plates, Two Poles concept brought to life by the heavy industrialists at Kaiser Steel, and some of his other work can also be found among the art museum's exhibits. Proposals for the Art + Tech Lab are being accepted now through January 27th, and it’s hoped that the more transparent process and open participation will help to match or surpass the feats of the original group. If nothing else, it should provide an intriguing comparison between the imagined futures of yesteryear and today.",0.8955943819412839,0.10440561805871607,0.8429782032259533,960,5.1416666666666666,516,6.5717054263565888,0,0,"Design, Tech, Report",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

And after taking just one look at the Magnetophone (or better yet, listening to it), it's clear that the term is justified. Sherwood began playing music professionally at age 15, but in more recent years has focused his efforts on art. Last year he created Firewall, an interactive membrane surface with stunning fire-like visuals. But the Magnetophone — not to be confused with the reel-to-reel tape player — may be his most impressive work yet. It features 14 guitar strings and 14 homemade electromagnets, with continuously generative, electromagnetic fields that cause those strings to vibrate. Measuring 3 feet tall, it's made primarily from aluminum and acrylic. (Sherwood started out with plywood, but said the result looked ""too much like a grandfather clock"" and didn't meet his goal of making Magnetophone ""look less like an instrument."") Guitar strings of various gauges run up the sides, helping achieve different sounds. As for how it all comes together, Sherwood says, ""Acoustically, the strings vibrate the bridge, which vibrates the front plate, which pushes air molecules inside the resonance chamber back to bounce off the back wall."" He goes on: When electricity passes through the coil a magnetic field is generated. Since I’m sending a square wave to the coil, the magnetic field is oscillating on and off at the frequency of the wave. I put a bolt through the hole of the bobbin, which becomes magnetized and vibrates with the magnetic field. The magnetic field from the bolt pulls and releases the string making it vibrate, which makes sound.  An Arduino chip serves as the sculpture's brain; Sherwood says it ""decides"" what to play while continuously generating new music. The Arduino alternates between two modes; in one mode, it simply plays random strings. In the other, Sherwood says it will play patterns or sequences with certain strings and continue looping that same melody for a short period. More details are available at his blog, and you can see the Magnetophone in action below.",0.6182592205329456,0.3817407794670544,0.21754728119413005,342,5.2017543859649127,235,5.8085106382978724,0,0,Design,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

But the military category alone is far larger: Israel's small triangular Harpy, China's huge four-winged Soaring Dragon. Artist Ruben Pater's Drone Survival Guide is ostensibly for use in spotting and evading these drones, collecting the above craft and more in a birdwatching poster-style set of silhouettes. Like the ""Stealth Wear"" line of clothing, it's even theoretically designed to protect the user, printed on a mirrored surface that could be used to try to confuse a drone's camera. Unlike Stealth Wear or other more general commentaries, though, the survival guide turns drones into something knowable and specific, not a frightening catch-all category but a series of real, individual aircraft. The drone survival guide, which started as Pater's graphic design masters project, is a lot like Bridle's drone recognition kit, and both pieces evoke the plane-spotting kits and cards used during World War II. ""Of course, the idea you can hide from UAVs or be safe from them if they have harmful intentions is absurd,"" says Pater, although the back of the guide describes simple tactics like blocking your heat signature with a space blanket or more complex ones like hacking a GPS signal. Something like the aluminum poster surface, though in principle it could work for evasion, is more useful for its symbolic meaning, reminding readers that surveillance drones are in a way ""sophisticated mirrors."" ""When the public has adopted a name like that, it's impossible to change it to something 'less scary.'"" The survival guide encompasses everything from the massive Sentinel and Global Hawk surveillance craft to the portable Wasp III, almost invisible in a scale rendering of the two. They're nearly all military and meant for surveillance and attack, with one strange exception: the AR Parrot, a little consumer quadcopter that's controlled with a smartphone. The Parrot is a reminder that more than a word, ""drone"" is an aesthetic, encompassing virtually anything that flies without a pilot and could signify an alien, mechanized future. At its best, the drone aesthetic and ubiquitous use of the term forcibly reminds residents of drone-owning countries of the supposedly clean, often invisible killings that take place overseas, or highlights the astonishing surveillance capabilities of an all but permanent aerial megacamera like Argus. Pater says accepting more blandly descriptive terms like UAV diminishes this impact. ""When the public has adopted a name like that, it's impossible to change  it to something 'less scary,'"" he says. ""That's why I use the word. My Afghan  translator said that even in Afghanistan they also use the English word  'drone'. The whole point of military acronyms is to make dangerous  technologies sound less scary."" At its worst, the aesthetic airbrushes everything with a glamorously dangerous tone, granting safe Americans living near unmanned crop dusters, for example, a hint of the edgy cachet that comes from obliquely putting them in the same boat as people who find their wedding parties mistaken for al-Qaeda gatherings. Almost nobody pretends that a camera-equipped quadcopter is the same as a sensor-equipped Global Hawk, but they end up semantically equated with each other. That's how you end up with things like this. ""I agree putting a Predator in the same category as the quadcopter is stretching the idea of what a UAV is, although it is something we see everywhere,"" says Pater. ""We had remote-controlled toy planes for many years without referring to them as kill robots."" ""In a way we are looking at ourselves through sophisticated mirrors."" But including a hobbyist product on his poster, he says, was done partly because of its ubiquity, and for the future implications. ""A Parrot AR Drone, which is sold on Amazon and electronic stores everywhere for an affordable price, could easily be outfitted with weapons, spyware, or whatever else people can think of. Because there is so little oversight, I think most people should be more aware of those than the large UAVs that the military uses."" Pater says he doesn't believe the guide to be particularly functional, but ""the fact that people are not sure whether it's an artistic project or something else is interesting for me, especially because I notice people find it scary that it is translated in an Arabic language."" Since the project appeared on Gizmodo, he says he's gotten three more translations in Italian, Arabic, and Indonesian. Free versions of the poster are downloadable online, with reflective ones sold through the site, and Pater says he's talking to organizations in Pakistan and Afghanistan in hopes of using the guide for activism or education — even if you can't spot a drone in the air, you can understand who owns them and what they're being used for. ""For me, that would be a very successful end goal of the project.""",0.5547511077558162,0.44524889224418385,0.22787105031909924,822,5.1496350364963508,468,6.3824786324786329,0,0,"Design, Report",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

The designer was walking through an old warehouse when he came upon a hodgepodge of obsolete computers, calculators, telephones, and printers, and decided to take the pallets back to his studio. His vision produced The Binary Collection, a line of furniture made out of up-cycled, disposed electronics that shows us how much e-waste we actually produce. The understructure of each piece is made of computer towers and sheet metal from printers that are bent to the proper form and riveted together. The surface of each piece is completely covered with colorful motherboards, computer chips, LCD screens, and hard drive disks held in place by sheet metal screws. In the chairs, the cushions are made from woven together ribbon cable and ethernet cables, and the tables have a functional surface made of salvaged glass above the base. The art and pop culture worlds have taken notice of The Binary Collection, the most famous fan being Mother Monster herself. The collection was exhibited in a large installation called ""Living in the Computer Age"" at Lady Gaga's ArtRave, an event to celebrate and promote the singer's latest album, ARTPOP. Rollins Caldwell found the partnership fitting, not only because the chair looks like how many of the tracks on ARTPOP sound, but also because he says he likes viewers to be able to relate to his work, much like music. In addition to Gaga's show, The Binary Collection was recently exhibited at Design Miami. Next stop — San Francisco's FOG art fair, where the entire Binary Room installation will be from January 16–19, 2014. All images courtesy of BRC Designs.  The Binary Collection was featured in a room installation at this year's Design Miami. The entire exterior of the Binary Chair is made from motherboards and computer chips. All of the parts used to make the furniture were 100 percent recycled from abandoned electronics. Chair cushions were made from woven ethernet and ribbon cables. The added piece of salvaged glass on the Binary Table provides functionality without impeding its beauty. Rollins Caldwell spent hours deconstructing computers and other electronics to get the parts he needed, and even more time placing them on each design to make the final pieces as aesthetically pleasing as possible. Caldwell says the Binary Cabinet was the most challenging piece to create, because the interior is made of bent and riveted computer tower metal — something that's not easily made visually appealing.

Since its launch in 2007, the team — led by Daniel Van der Velden and Vinca Kruk — has pursued collaborations with organizations that traditionally don't seek out graphic design as a platform or medium. Examples include the whistleblower platform WikiLeaks, the Icelandic Modern Media Institute (IMMI), and the diplomatic advisory group Independent Diplomat. An interdisciplinary group of writers, editors, critics, and curators, the collective has been able to expand upon the foundation of designer as form-maker and break free from the traditional confines of the studio. Its avant-garde aesthetics and intellectual approaches have lead to exhibitions at the Walker Art Center, the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum, and the Museum of Modern Art in New York. Metahaven has also written extensively about the internet as a political and creative space — anyone interested is encouraged to check out the book Uncorporate Identity. Metahaven's latest work, Black Transparency, is a short film that incorporates graphic design to make a statement about ""collectivity and togetherness"" in a police state, according to the group. ""Many people are starting to understand that the structures which claim to serve them have turned against them.""  Verge Exclusive: Metahaven, Black Transparency (videogram), 2013. Video. Co-produced with Bureau Europa. Can you explain the work you created for WikiLeaks? How did that work differ from traditional brand-identity work? Our initial work for WikiLeaks aimed at an overhaul of their visual presence as a matter of graphic design. We were interested in WikiLeaks as a somewhat anonymous, opaque organization publishing leaked documents — and causing great upheaval because powerful others, governments and corporations, didn’t want those documents out in the world. At the time, Julian Assange didn’t have a lot of celebrity status. He did make public appearances though, and these were mired in mystery and controversy, even as fashion statements. He addressed a freedom-of-speech working group of the European Union wearing an Icelandic sweater. To us, all this seemed to be about reinventing what an organization is. We reasoned that obliviousness to celebrity, while doing such important work, contained a great possibility for graphic design. The WikiLeaks logo, of which we discovered the original designer, could be expanded into an ecosystem which would reflect the site’s multijurisdictional hosting model. That is a complex way of saying that WikiLeaks was hosted in many countries to make it uncensorable, and the identity should reflect that.  Metahaven, WikiLeaks Identity (unrealized proposal), 2010. In the end, we never made a complete rebranding of WikiLeaks. When meeting with them we found out we couldn't do anything with their identity. They wanted to shape their graphic relationship to the world through products; the non-designed nature of the WikiLeaks web site is an example of their minimized reliance on external parties.  Metahaven, WikiLeaks scarves, 2011. Photo by Meinke Klein. What sort of products did you design for WikiLeaks? We primarily made scarves and T-shirts. Scarves came up as a way to make something about WikiLeaks without even touching their “identity.” Scarves are in some sense wearable flags; they can be used to conceal as well as reveal the body and the face. What are your thoughts on the activities of WikiLeaks? Has their work affected how we view and understand information? In a post-Snowden era, it's important to remember that although Collateral Murder is now three years behind us, WikiLeaks is where our new model for involuntary transparency began. That is, transparency that stems from leaks and not from government or corporate ""transparency programs."" It is impossible to even imagine our contemporary understanding of such transparency without WikiLeaks. It has sparked a movement. It can't be undone. How have the actions of Edward Snowden changed the story of WikiLeaks in your mind? Edward Snowden's actions are a continuation of the WikiLeaks story. The slightly problematic part of this story is the role of Russia. None of the EU countries and not even Iceland or Norway were prepared to do anything at all for Snowden, so he ended up in the only jurisdiction within reach that wanted him. On Snowden's part, staying in Russia is in his direct self-interest. It is very hard to believe that any genuine ethical concern has motivated the asylum offer. For Russia it is a means, not an end; it shows the country's cunning ability to sail the geopolitical trade winds ""just because it can."" Other examples are Putin's New York Times letter to President Obama, the state-owned English-language channel RT which hosted Assange's show; and more. Yet this is also the country that ruthlessly persecutes its own whistleblowers, incarcerates Pussy Riot in a prison in Siberia, and sides with Syria's Assad government. An even more stunning contradiction however is that the same Assad has an Instagram account — as Independent Diplomat's Carne Ross alerted us.

Fabric-like objects were technically possible, but they weren't things people could print using their own MakerBots. Nervous System, a generative design studio, is working to change that: its new, free desktop app Kinematics allows anyone with a 3D printer to create flexible products at home. Kinematics' simulation and compression technology can take the design of an object larger than the 3D printer itself and crumple it up to a size that will make it fit in the printer, allowing it to be made in one shot, in one piece. The final product is, literally and figuratively, larger than the sum of its parts.  The process starts with the design for a 3D-printed object like a bracelet. The Kinematics app turns the design into a puzzle made of hundreds, and sometimes thousands, of triangles. The smaller the triangles, the more flexible the final piece. All the triangular puzzle pieces are then connected and the final design is compressed down to a size that will let it be printed in one continuous piece in a 3D printer. Currently you can make flexible pieces of jewelry and smaller objects using Kinematics, but Nervous System is working to add support for more complex items, like dresses, that would be specially fit to the wearer's body using 3D scanning. That technology is further down the road, but for now, the collection of things 3D printers can make at home just got a little bigger, more flexible, and slightly more practical.

As the Atlanta Falcons and Detroit Lions descended upon London this weekend, accompanying them were executives from Zebra Technologies, the company behind the RFID-based motion tracking system that the league is implementing this season. Zebra is in town to try and convince the operators of Wembley Stadium and the rest of the sports world to follow the example set by the NFL. I spoke with them about what makes their technology compelling and the future applications it can have for coaches, fans, and players of all sports.   Using a pair of location beacons embedded in each player’s shoulder pads, the Zebra system is able to measure speed, acceleration, and distance covered in nearly real-time — there’s just a half-second latency — and to within a margin of error of less than 6 inches. Referees and the first-down measuring sticks along the sideline are also equipped with the coin-sized RFID tags, leaving only the ball as an untracked entity on the field. (Zebra is working on a custom transmitter with wider weight distribution for 2015 that will make it possible to track the most critical object without affecting its flight or feel.) The company describes 2014 as a ""best effort"" year, with half the NFL stadiums being outfitted with its sensor networks and only occasional uses of the technology manifesting themselves in game broadcasts till now. But the vision for this technology is much grander than its present state.   The 2011 CBA already has provisions for location tracking on the field The obvious first use for precise positional information of this sort is for coaches looking to analyze their players’ performance. Did the wide receiver run the exact route he was supposed to? Did the cornerback keep a disciplined distance away? WIth built-in accelerometers and the redundancy of having two sensors per player, the tracking system knows which way a player is facing and how smoothly he is moving around the field (on top of how quickly). For the players, that will mean an extra layer of accountability, going beyond the already extensive set of statistics that are tracked on each play. There’ll be no dissension from among their ranks, however, since they agreed to wear sensors for tracking of location and health metrics in their 2011 Collective Bargaining Agreement. The NFL has been preparing to deploy what it calls Next Gen Stats for a long time. It signed up Zebra as its provider this summer after a year-long evaluation period that included other competing solutions. The league’s focus is actually less on providing analytics for its member teams and more on augmenting the fan experience. In fact, in order to ensure fairness, the NFL isn’t releasing the data it’s gathering to the teams until all 31 stadiums have installed the sensor system necessary to track the RFID tags. Enhancing the fan experience is taking primacy over coach analytics Thursday Night Football broadcasts on CBS have been the primary beneficiaries of the early use of Next Gen Stats, showing things like JJ Watt’s incredible 20mph speed on a fumble return and the separation that a wide receiver achieves on a successful touchdown pass. Instead of the usual hastily scribbled doodles from the color commentator, viewers are now getting precise lines showing exactly how a player manages to get wide open and an accurate account of each juke, hurdle, or sprint. In a league obsessed with keeping track of all possible player measurables, it’s surprising to find that most physical indicators are measured outside of game conditions, at events like the Scouting Combine each spring. Zebra combines such known metrics as a player’s 40-yard dash time with the data it collects from the game to validate its findings.   What’s unique about this system, versus competing GPS-based alternatives, is the simplicity and ease of implementation. There’s nothing particularly smart about each RFID tag, as it just beams out a message saying ""I’m here"" 25 times per second that a network of 20 sensors around the bowl of a stadium triangulates to a precise location. Tags only have to be installed once per player per season and can last for years at a time. Their accelerometer data is only transferred when a certain threshold is crossed and high-fidelity location tracking is only enabled during live plays, making the whole thing rather efficient on bandwidth as well. Not that interference should be an issue, since the Zebra tags work in the 6.4GHz ultra wideband range where conventional wireless devices don't. There’s plenty of room for the information gathering to grow. Experiments are already underway to use the Bluetooth Low Energy radio built into the Zebra tags to expand their functionality. One of the future goals will be to figure out a suitable way to attach them to the player’s skin so as to get heart rate and training intensity data as well. Before its NFL deal, Zebra successfully rolled out its system with the Shanghai Women’s Soccer team in China, so it already has a good idea of how to adapt the technology to other sports. Like RFID tags themselves, Zebra Technologies is a company with a ubiquitous presence that’s rarely felt. It does asset tracking and management for a number of auto companies and counts Walmart as one of its biggest clients. Zebra has a long history of tracking ""expensive, mobile, and mission-critical assets,"" and makes the point that that’s exactly what NFL players are. Now it’s just a matter of getting one of these beacons on the most mobile and mission-critical asset in the game: the ball itself.",0.5759888950055512,0.42401110499444883,0.8403939872985339,977,5.03582395087001,530,6.3490566037735849,0,16,"Business, Culture, Entertainment, Report",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

The company's lack of profits and slowing user growth has marred its relatively strong financial performance over its first year as a public company. On the call that followed, CEO Dick Costolo said the company's goal was to have the largest audience in the world. He laid out his vision for measuring the true size of Twitter, trying to give Wall Street a narrative they could rally behind — and it was a doozy. ""Geometrically eccentric circles."" ""You should think about the size of our total audience as a series of geometrically eccentric circles,"" Costolo explained. (He may have meant concentric circles, but he said ""eccentric circles"" twice during the course of the call.) At the center of this geometric oddity are the 284 million monthly active users who log in to Twitter. Beyond that, Costolo’s logic goes, is a second circle of people who come to Twitter every month and read tweets, but don't log in. That group is roughly 1-2 times the size of its logged-in audience, says Costolo. Beyond that is an even larger group of people who consume tweets when they see them embedded in web pages and syndicated on television. Add all those numbers up and you get an audience that is equal to or larger than the 1.3 billion people who use Facebook every month. Costolo would like investors to believe that is a huge untapped opportunity for growth in Twitter's business, but so far they aren't buying it. The stock is currently sitting slightly above its IPO price and well below its record high in January of this year. Still, there may be real upside behind the company’s fuzzy math. Right now, people who are not logged into Twitter don't see ads. People who are logged in but are using Twitter on third-party apps, or even Twitter’s own TweetDeck, also don't see ads. Costolo says all that will change. ""We will think about and look for opportunities to provide our native advertising units in syndication, both to other Twitter-based properties, like TweetDeck, and across the entire mobile application ecosystem."" Can Twitter make money every time you read a Tweet, even if you don't have a Twitter account? The company just rolled out a new mobile developer platform, Fabric, which it hopes will encourage lots of new apps to show its tweets in a way that can make Twitter money. Costolo said there are already over 10,000 developers using Fabric, reaching more than one billion iOS and Android users collectively. Twitter has plans to help those developers make money against all those tweets through MoPub, a mobile ad exchange it acquired last year. CFO Anthony Noto pointed out that a lot of people who end up at Twitter’s site but aren't logged in have arrived because they searched for a specific person or topic on a major search engine like Google or Bing. Right now Twitter doesn't make any money off of them, but Noto emphasized that there is quite a bit of user intent Twitter can measure there — just as Google does during a search — something that advertisers value. Twitter makes an average of roughly $3-4 per user, well below Facebook and Google. But Noto thinks that can improve drastically. ""We see nothing structurally preventing us from reaching the monetization levels of our industry peers,"" he argued on the earnings call, citing $10 per user as a goal. My father uses Twitter every day, but never tweets a word As a rabid Twitter user, I watched with interest when my father, who is over 60 years old and retired, began experimenting with the service. He started out browsing it without logging in, just checking the timelines of some newsmakers he finds interesting. That went on for nearly a year. After a while he began using it often enough that it was worth creating an account, but I'm not sure he would have done it without me around to help him set it up. I don't think he's ever written a single tweet, but he now checks it at least once a day when he's home on his computer. For him, Twitter delivers ideas, jokes, and links from people he respects and admires. Twitter’s big argument is that they can monetize folks like my dad earlier, and do more to ensure they bring him fully into the fold. If the company could succeed at that, would it achieve Costolo’s long term goal of the largest audience in the world? Facebook will likely continue to be much larger than Twitter in terms of its logged-in user base, but the vast majority of the activity that happens on its platform is private. Twitter has always been a very public network, which means a lot of people are going to get value out of it without having to sign up.

In late July, the Japanese games company reported growing losses and decreasing revenues, which weren't stemmed by Mario Kart's boost to both software and hardware sales. Still, Nintendo managed to triple the number of Wii U consoles it sold in that quarter relative to its performance a year earlier, and it's kept that momentum going with another year-on-year doubling in sales. 610,000 Wii U consoles were sold in the past three months, adding to the 510,000 of the previous quarter and taking Nintendo's six-month total past the million mark.  Nintendo's financial situation hasn't improved dramatically, however the growing sales numbers have helped the company break even in terms of operating income and report a net profit of 14.3 billion yen (roughly $130 million) once foreign exchange gains are factored in as well. What's more, Nintendo forecasts having a profitable year overall with further improvements in sales anticipated as the holiday season ramps up. Though the Wii U is showing signs of life and broader appeal, Nintendo may rightly be more worried about its portable console, the 3DS, whose sales declined over the past six months. The stalwart Wii console is also still selling, but in ever decreasing numbers and Nintendo's latest figures show that its software sales over the past half year were roughly a third what they were a year ago. To live up to its anticipated profitable year, Nintendo will have to keep delivering compelling games like Mario Kart to replenish the seemingly waning interest of gamers.

Twitter's booked $361 million in revenue over the last three months, more than double what it did for the same period in 2013. It also hit its marks on profit — $7 million, which is exactly what investors were expecting. But the stock is down more than 10 percent in after-hours trading, as investors flee a stock that hasn't shown the upside they were looking for in a young, high-flying social network. What does that mean? Basically that investors were hoping Twitter would do more than just clear the low bar it had set for itself this quarter. They wanted a big surprise to the upside, and are punishing the stock for delivering nothing beyond its promised projections. On the earnings call, the company's chief financial officer, Anthony Noto, specifically warned investors not to expect Twitter to best its projections in the future. Investors were hoping Twitter would do more than clear the low bar it set for itself Investors may also be disappointed that the company's user growth has flattened significantly.  On average, the company had 284 million monthly active users over the last three months, an increase of 23 percent over the same period in 2013. But that's much slower growth than 2013, when Twitter was expanding on an average of about 50 percent year-over-year. CEO Dick Costolo said on the earnings call that the company's goal is to reach the largest audience in the world, but at this rate, they won't be catching Facebook anytime soon. The value of Twitter's ads is growing One metric that is moving in the right direction is the value of Twitter's ads. People checked their timelines 181 billion times, a 14 percent increase year-over-year. And Twitter got paid more for those views, making $1.77 for every thousand views of its timeline, a whopping 83 percent increase from the same period in 2013. The profit that Twitter reported is not straightforward. It lost $175.4 million on based on the stricter set of accounting rules that public companies must file. On the looser standards, which is what investors have been monitoring for Twitter, it reported that small $7 million profit, or roughly 1 cent per share. The difference comes largely from whether or not you count stock-based compensation of its employees, which is a frequently used tool among tech companies in the highly competitive hiring environment of Silicon Valley. Twitter believes its true audience is much larger than it now shows On the call Costolo emphasized that Twitter sees its audience as a set of concentric circles. The 284 million people who sign in each month, the much larger group that regularly reads tweets but doesn't log in to create any, and the evan larger group that sees tweets when they appear in other media like news articles and TV broadcasts. Noto said the group of logged out readers was roughly two to three times the size of the logged in audience. Noto called out the Indian election as an event which had driven activity in the previous quarter, but was missing this past three months. Its a reminder that Twitter is very dependent on political and sporting events to drive its business. This could be seen as both a blessing and a curse. It means Twitter lacks control over its growth to a certain extent. But it also means its users are highly engaged around topical events that can drive big advertising dollars. Right now the company doesn't show ads to users logged into third party Twitter apps. When asked why it wasn't trying to capture value from those users, Costolo said that ads would be coming to services like Tweetdeck in the future.

In 2014, WhatsApp lost $140 million, and generated just $10 million in revenue. Facebook, meanwhile has nearly three times as many users as WhatsApp, but generated $3.2 billion in revenue this quarter.  Spoiler alert: A LOT OF GOODWILL RT @jyarow: How Facebook valued WhatsApp. pic.twitter.com/Y93Qu0qxyO $FB  It's not a fair comparison, of course. Facebook is an older company with a gigantic sales team that has monetized in a very predictable way: ads. With 1.3 billion users, it's not so hard to make billions of dollars. WhatsApp, on the other hand, has yet to flesh out its business beyond a $1/year subscription plan, but said that it has no intention of adding ads. Still, Facebook's acquisition of the company was never about acquiring a profitable company — it was about acquiring users. Users across the globe, especially users WhatsApp has but Facebook doesn't, are incredibly valuable. This last quarter, the average revenue per Facebook user in the US was over $7. To be more precise, Facebook accounted for its WhatsApp purchase as follows: $2 billion for its userbase, $448 million for its brand, $288 million for its technology, and $15.3 billion in ""goodwill."" Still, it stands to reason that WhatsApp should be generating much more than $10 million in revenue from (at least some of) its 500 million users paying its $1/year subscription fee, right? It's not totally clear how that's working out, but it might have something to do with many users being grandfathered in to free subscriptions: @hamburger The first year is free. Also: iPhone users who have been on board for a long time usually have 10 years of usage for free.  @hamburger WhatsApp only charges in select countries. In other places (even Germany) they constantly extend the free period out of goodwill.  A final note: of the $148 million WhatsApp lost in 2013, a large part of that money went to paying out stock to employees. This is standard for growing companies hiring new talent, and shouldn't convey that WhatsApp was burning money irresponsibly. $148 million is a lot to lose for a small company, but the company seems to have been doing it wisely.

""Nobody today is delivering any solution that will get scale, including me,"" he said onstage at the Open Mobile Summit. Soon, facing insurmountable odds from iron-fisted cell carriers and credit card companies, version one of Google Wallet (which emphasized wireless NFC payments) flopped and Bedier left Google.  Why not support every way we’re going to pay in the future? But Bedier remained one of the most reputable mobile payments executives in the industry, having also worked at PayPal for years prior to working at Google. He went on to invest in Coin, the digital credit card that holds a wallet full of cards, and joined the board of PayPal competitor WePay. But a burning question remained: how could you convince carriers and retailers to adopt new payments technology? NFC had obvious benefits, from enhanced security to convenience, but everybody wanted a piece of the pie and nothing got done. And then, news broke about a mandate that would force all American retailers to support EMV, also known as ""chip and pin cards,"" by the end of 2015. Bedier had found his solution. Square and other payments companies announced plans to roll out new readers that support both magnetic strip cards and EMV, but Bedier thought: what better time than now to build the best payments terminal in the world? Why not support every way we’re going to pay in the future — and then sell it to banks, who actually provide readers to stores, not carriers. Today, we’re getting a first look at that product. It’s called Poynt, costs $299, and ships in Q1 2015.   Poynt is a complete ""point of sale"" (POS) machine that includes every payment tech you’d want to use — magnetic stripe (today's credit cards), EMV (chip and pin cards), NFC (Apple Pay), QR code (Starbucks), and Beacon (Bluetooth, but we’re yet to see many of this kind). Poynt has a 7-inch, quad-core Android tablet built-in, as well as a 4.3-inch touchscreen for typing in PINs. Poynt even bundles in a tiny receipt printer, a rechargeable 8-hour battery, and a 3G / 4G modem. Poynt works with magnetic stripe, EMV, NFC, QR code, and Beacon Bedier’s machine isn’t as exciting as a digital credit card or a contactless mobile wallet, but might in fact have more of an impact in changing the payments landscape as we know it. While Apple, Walmart, and others argue over their NFC payments systems, most retailers still have credit card readers that appear to have been built in the 1980s. Even more recent readers, like those you might find at CVS or McDonalds, look outdated and clunky compared to today’s consumer technology. Building a more modern, consumery POS system might seem like low hanging fruit, and it is. But Bedier says that until it was announced that all US retailers would need to buy new POS systems, pitching a more modern device was a tough sell. After all, Poynt isn’t pitching consumers who love new gadgets — it’s pitching old, curmudgeonly banks who hate change. The EMV mandate, in combination with all the recent retailer data leaks, proved to be a recipe for such change. ""The Target breach made it clear how bad security had gotten in the country, and almost every week since we’ve heard of a new breach,"" says Bedier, ""so now networks are rethinking this.""   Alongside impressive hardware, Poynt also integrates an open software platform that developers or retailers can use to build cashier apps and other finance apps. Poynt does ship with a Square Register-esque inventory app, though it’s far worse looking than Square’s. But that shouldn’t matter to the massive banks and retailers Poynt is courting. To these companies, what matters most is security, and Bedier and co. did their homework. Poynt integrate industry standard SSL, DUKPT, TDES, PKI and AES encryption to secure payment data, and also meets PCI and EMV requirements for payments hardware. The device also includes tamper detection that wipes data and alerts merchants if there’s been any tampering. Poynt is, from the outside, a better product than the credit card reader you just swiped, but Poynt doesn’t have to convince consumers — it has to convince banks. Bedier says that talks are ongoing with the country’s largest banks, who have the distributing power to buy millions of Poynts and deliver them to retailers. Also, with a team composed of  ex-employees from PayPal, eBay, Google, Amazon, Apple, Hypercom and Verifone, Poynt likely has the knowledge required to get its product off the ground. ""Poynt is an absolute game changer,"" said Dana Stalder, a former senior vice president at PayPal who invested in the company. Bedier is very clearly proud of what he’s built. But perhaps he’s most satisfied with the idea that he might happily sit on the sidelines of the upcoming NFC payments war. No matter who earns more market share, whether it’s Apple, CurrentC, SoftCard, or even Google Wallet, Poynt wins. And this is good for your average consumer, too — if more credit card readers offer more ways to pay, perhaps the best payments system will actually be the payments system you use.",0.5473991543641727,0.45260084563582725,0.3028670253702501,881,4.9387060158910332,490,5.869387755102041,0,4,"Business, Mobile, Tech, Report",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

Last month the streaming-music service Deezer introduced Elite, a premium take on Spotify that offers lossless, 16-bit FLAC streaming — more than five times the quality of existing services, Deezer says. But there was a huge catch: for now at least, Deezer Elite only works with Sonos speakers. In order to access high-quality music, you need to already own pricey hardware. Today a Swedish company named Aspiro is releasing a similarly high-end service called Tidal, but it’s much more widely available. You can listen on iOS, Android, or a web app, along with 34 home audio systems including Sonos, all for $19.99 a month. The sound is stunning That price represents a huge premium over services like Spotify and Rdio, which cost $9.99 (or less if you share a plan). But in a few days of testing Tidal, I can see its appeal to audiophiles — you can absolutely tell the difference in sound quality between existing services and this one, and at times its 16-bit FLAC files can be stunning. Tidal is built on the back of WiMP, a goofily named Spotify competitor in Europe, and so it comes with a catalog of 25 million tracks that so far has had most of what I’ve searched for. (It also has 75,000 ad-free music videos in high definition.) What Tidal doesn’t have is great design — if you’re used to the elegance of Rdio, or even the more workmanlike Spotify, Tidal’s black-and-white hodgepodge likely won’t impress you. And those huge files you’re streaming have downsides of their own: there’s a noticeable lag when you skip tracks as the file buffers; saving files to your mobile device can quickly chew through your storage; and streaming for even a few hours over LTE could be hell on your data plan.   Still, if you identify as an audiophile, Tidal is worth a look. ""This service is not for everybody,"" says Andy Chen, the company’s CEO. ""Spotify is for everybody. You don't even need to pay! But for quality, you have to pay."" Chen says Tidal is aimed at audiophiles who have suffered as audio has gradually worsened in the transition from vinyl to compact discs to MP3s. ""It’s for people frustrated by the progressively worse fidelity we’ve gotten from music,"" he says. Streaming music is the future, and if you’ve invested in a high-end sound system — or even just decent headphones — you’re going to want to take advantage of them. What I really want is for Spotify and Rdio to offer a high-definition version of the service that most of us already use — I like those products, my playlists are there, and so are most of my friends. I’d like also like to be able to access high-quality audio for less than $20 a month. But in the meantime, you may want to give Tidal a try. It sounds like the future.",0.5187288200953594,0.48127117990464063,0.15927842402181325,492,4.6951219512195124,284,5.6161971830985919,0,2,"Apps, Business, Tech, Report",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

Can they convince investors to give them the seed capital they need to grow?  Let's say you need to fix your vacuum cleaning robot, or even worse, the machine that makes your vacuum cleaning robot. You know which part is broken, but where do you go from there? Most of the time when the machine reaches the customer, it's already assembled and the parts aren't labeled at all. Without that crucial bit of info, it can be very difficult to explain to a sales rep exactly what you need, or find a replacement you can order on the web. Googling for ""round, squiggly rubber thing with the metal edges"" won't help. Partpic, a startup from Atlanta, Georgia, is hoping to solve that problem. Think of it as visual search for replacement parts. Snap some photos of the item with your phone and the app will try and match you to a replacement part you can buy nearby or online. Over the last year the company has been building its product and working with its first customer to iron out the kinks. It got some money from an accelerator program, a few startup competitions, along with backing from friends and family. But up to this point no one at the company has been getting a steady salary, so they are all working two jobs instead. Now Partpic is trying to raise a seed round: its first big investment from professional venture capitalist. It's a make or break moment, with the PartPic team needing to convince jaded investors the company has the potential to grow into a huge business in order to get the capital they need to make their dream a full time occupation.

If you visited a website from a Verizon phone, there's a good chance the carrier injected a special tag into the data sent from you phone, telling the website exactly who you were and where you were coming from, all without alerting customers or informing the public at large. Today, Forbes' Kashmir Hill reports that AT&T is testing a similar program, although it may be possible to opt out. In both cases, the message is clear: there's a lucrative business in tracking users across the web, and carriers want in on it. Networks like this have been used for surveillance before Carriers have usually stayed out of the ad-tracking business, although many of the same divisions have offered pilot programs in tracking users' locations. Instead, most of the tracking on the web happens through third-party firms like Google's Doubleclick, which use easily identified cookies to follow users from site to site. But the carrier programs are inserting trackers at a higher level, in the process of routing data requests, which make the cookies both harder to identify and nearly impossible for a user to shake off. Verizon and AT&T will tell you they just want to help serve you more relevant ads, which isn't so bad on the face of it — but we've seen networks like this used for much more questionable ends, most notably when the NSA took over Google's cookie-tracking network to help target malware injections. Tracking is tracking, and it's hard to tell what else might be built on top of the network once it's in use. For Verizon and AT&T customers — which, put together, compose a little more than two-thirds of US citizens — the result is a comprehensive surveillance system that they didn't approve and, until this month, were largely unaware of.",0.2617479042955206,0.7382520957044794,0.17529212921865564,323,4.9566563467492264,213,5.694835680751174,0,0,"Business, Mobile",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

Today, the judge in the Ellen Pao trial ruled that Pao could sue her former employer, venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins, for punitive damages. Earlier this week, we reported that a former Facebook employee is suing the company for sexual discrimination and sexual harassment, among other offenses. Now it seems Twitter too will face legal pushback for gender discrimination. A former female software engineer at Twitter filed a class action lawsuit this week claiming the company's promotion process unlawfully favors men, according to Reuters. There's a ""shoulder tap"" process for promotions A class action suit was filed on Thursday in San Francisco by former Twitter employee Tina Huang, according to Pando Daily. The suit alleges that Twitter relies on a ""black box"" style of promotion, wherein employees are notified of open positions via a mysterious ""shoulder tap"" process. This fraternity-esque promotional style takes the place of any formal job postings, Reuters reports. Huang claims she was overlooked for a promotion and ultimately let go after she complained about it. Text from the lawsuit, obtained by Mashable, says a largely male upper management is responsible for all the hiring decisions, and that creates an environment that favors men, intentional or not: Promotion into Twitter’s senior technical positions is based on subjective judgments, by committees that are comprised of and dependent on upper management at Twitter, and predominantly male. These judgments are tainted with conscious or unconscious prejudices and gender-based stereotypes, which explains why so few women employees at Twitter advance to senior and leadership positions. Twitter, however, maintains that Huang left the company on her own terms. ""Ms. Huang resigned voluntarily from Twitter, after our leadership tried to persuade her to stay. She was not fired. Twitter is deeply committed to a diverse and supportive workplace, and we believe the facts will show Ms. Huang was treated fairly,"" a Twitter spokesperson told The Verge. The lawsuit says it seeks to end Twitter's discriminatory practices on behalf of ""all similarly situated current and former female Twitter employees.""

Back in 2011, when President Obama first announced that milestone as one of the administration's goals, the nation's largest carrier provided LTE to just over half of the US population. 3G service, meanwhile, was available to only 95 percent of the population. The administration provided $7 billion in funding to help bring wireless networks up to speed across the nation, and it credits its high-profile spectrum auctions with helping make nationwide LTE a reality. Broadband in the US still lags behind other nations In addition, the administration points out that last month the FCC struck down laws restricting broadband growth in two the of 19 states that were called out as part of his broadband plan earlier this year. There's also a new policy being put in place today that will bring $35 million in loans to help promote broadband infrastructure in rural areas of Arkansas, New Mexico, and Iowa. Of course, despite these gains, the US broadband still ranks low among the most developed nations in the world — but there's no quick fix for that.",0.662502434574548,0.33749756542545195,0.875555493764638,275,4.9963636363636361,175,5.6742857142857144,1,0,"Mobile, Tech, US & World",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

Kahn said a reasonable juror could find evidence of gender discrimination Ellen Pao is suing for both punitive and compensatory damages in her gender discrimination trial against the venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins. Today, Judge Harold E. Kahn upheld the punitive damages claim, saying, ""There is sufficient evidence from which a reasonable juror could conclude that Kleiner Perkins engaged in intentional gender discrimination."" The trial is expected to reach closing arguments Tuesday. Pao, now the interim CEO of Reddit, will also be allowed to sue for compensatory damages. She is asking for $16 million in lost wages from being denied a promotion and fired from the firm in 2012. Punitive damages, however, are typically much higher because — as the name implies — the amount is meant to punish the defendant for inflicting harm. According to the Mercury News, in Pao's case, punitive damages would have been ""likely more than $100 million.""  Kleiner's attorney Lynne Hermle asked the judge to dismiss the punitive damages claim on Tuesday — and it was a bit of a shock that Kahn entertained the notion, questioning whether Pao had proven the malice, fraud, or oppression, the standards for punitive damages. The motion was initially filed on Tuesday unbeknownst to the jury, in one of many on-the-record discussions that happens out of the earshot of the six men and six women who will decide this case. Yesterday both legal teams were presenting  arguments to Judge Kahn for hours after the jury, when the San Francisco Superior Court is normally closed. It was clearly a tough call. The ruling is a pitfall for Kleiner Perkins, the prestigious Silicon Valley venture capital firm that has financed companies like Google, Amazon, Electronic Arts, and Uber. The back-and-forth between Judge Kahn and Pao's lawyer Alan Exelrod on Tuesday was very telling. In addition to gender discrimination, Pao is also suing for retaliation and failure to prevent retaliation after she complained about a partner named Ajit Nazre. Pao claims Nazre pressured her into a consensual affair and he was later fired for sexually harassing another female partner. The lawsuit alleges Kleiner soured on her after she complained about being excluded by Nazre and a host of other subtle instances of sexism. But Judge Kahn seems unconvinced about aspects of Pao's complaint: Pao certainly seems to be on trial for being likable as much of her performance as as a junior partner. But a recent witness, senior partner Juliet de Baubigny, disputed Pao's ""cover up"" narrative. De Baubigny used to help manage Kleiner's annual performance reviews, which include a list of the employees who contributed feedback. She testified that names were ""dropped off"" if the partner's opinion was not included in the final draft. The cover-up is one of many allegations made in Pao's complaint that seemed to be corroborated or disputed depending on whether the jury believes the plaintiff or defendant, rather than on clear evidence or facts.

Pharrell, in his interview with the FT, denied that there had been any infringement at all. ""You can’t own feelings and you can’t own emotions,"" he said.

Invested in Nintendo’s history from his time as a star programmer, Iwata rose up the ranks to take command at a young age and usher in one of the most dramatic transformations ever seen from a Japanese company. His vision upended and expanded the video game market, bringing years of astonishing profit to Nintendo with the DS and Wii. But more importantly, he made countless people happy. This afternoon I went down to the company’s headquarters, situated in a nondescript Kyoto suburb peppered with run-down garages and overgrown playgrounds. A forlorn employee made her way through the gate, wiping a tear from her cheek, and as I saw the Nintendo flag flying at half-mast I was hit by a tidal wave of sorrow. For any other company, for any other president or CEO, I wouldn’t have felt this way. But Satoru Iwata was more than just a CEO to many. He was an architect and steward of memories; I’ll be forever thankful. I only ever saw Iwata speak once in person, but it made a big impression. He had a rare gift, blessed with both a brain the size of a planet and a soft, articulate tenor that made his industry-shaping ideas seem like friendly advice from an uncle. Gaunt yet confident at Nintendo’s joint press conference with DeNA in March, Iwata explained the company’s situation and decision to enter the mobile market with remarkable eloquence, clarity, and poise. It was yet another example of how he often managed to rise above the short-term thinking of analysts and investors, sticking true to his beliefs and the principles of his company. And it breaks my heart to know that he’ll never see the plan through, nor the upcoming NX system he coyly mentioned that day, nor anything else. It’s easy to forget how revolutionary Nintendo’s products in the mid-2000s were, since they became ubiquitous so quickly. But following the technically proficient yet unadventurous and underselling GameCube, Nintendo and Iwata embarked on a strategy that struck many as reckless at the time. The Wii had terrible graphics and a weird motion controller that needed an attachment just for one analog stick. Nintendo also ditched the popular Game Boy brand for its next handheld, a curious device called the DS with two screens, a microphone, and a stylus for touch input. What was the company thinking? ""For me, I actually found that it would have been more frightening to take the conventional path,"" Iwata said. ""That path would eventually lead to a battle of sheer brute force with our competitors, and fewer and fewer consumers would be able to keep up."" Of course, both consoles turned out to be wild successes, in large part down to unconventional, accessible software like Wii Sports, Nintendogs, and Brain Age. It can’t be overstated how much Nintendo changed the mainstream image of gaming with the Wii and DS, and it reaped the rewards of a broadened audience for years. But to those who follow Nintendo for its games rather than its stock price, Iwata had a knack for connecting unlike any other suit. He ducked out of the regular press cycle by announcing news through quirky, entertaining Nintendo Direct web broadcasts. He offered fascinating insight into how Nintendo games are made by talking to developers in his Iwata Asks series of interviews, which now stands as a priceless archive of information. And he used social media in a humble, endearing fashion. ""I became a little thin as a result of my surgery last June,"" he recently tweeted alongside a cartoonish picture of a new, slimmer avatar. ""It looks like I’ll be able to maintain this figure since leaving the hospital, so I’ve updated my official Mii accordingly."" sometimes his strategy veered into hubris From any other president or CEO, tweets like that would seem dubiously on brand. But Iwata was the brand. He truly believed in the method behind Nintendo’s occasional madness, supporting the company as an artisanal group of creators closer to a toy maker than tech giant. And sometimes his strategy veered into hubris. Launching the 3DS at $250 four years after the first iPhone was optimistic in the extreme, resulting in a swift and painful price cut (and voluntary salary docking on Iwata’s part). The Wii U has proven to be a rare misstep at the conceptual level, as Nintendo failed to justify its design with complementary software. And Iwata’s steadfast pronouncements that the company would turn a major profit in 2013 were either naive or outright misleading; the only shock when Nintendo revised its forecast to a heavy loss in the year’s final quarter was that it had taken so long. But everything Iwata did was driven by an unshakeable belief in what Nintendo is and what it stands for. Nintendo is sometimes late to certain parties, but when it does do things that people have long clamored for, like mobile games or an online service, it does so on its own terms. Iwata passionately stood against the devaluation of games, for example, which is why you won’t see ports of existing Nintendo titles on phones. And his forward-thinking perspective extended to how he ran the company on an operational level. ""If we reduce the number of employees for better short-term financial results, employee morale will decrease,"" he told an investor who was calling for heads to roll in 2013. ""I sincerely doubt employees who fear that they may be laid off will be able to develop software titles that could impress people around the world."" The exchange sums up Iwata’s leadership — empathetic on a human level, yet grounded in a firm perspective that it was the right thing to do for business. In many ways Nintendo is a slow-moving, traditional company, but to characterize its leadership as stereotypical Japanese conservatism would be unfair. Creatively, there is no other company like Nintendo on Earth, and Iwata’s vision over the past decade-plus is a major reason that has been maintained. Never reactionary, always calm and focused — Iwata’s lasting legacy will be ensured if his successor shares the same devotion to company culture. Nintendo signalled that talismanic developer Shigeru Miyamoto will keep a role at the top of the company alongside hardware general manager Genyo Takeda, suggesting that dramatic change is unlikely. But speculation over the company’s future feels academic today. The reason I happened to be in Nintendo’s hometown of Kyoto when I heard the news was BitSummit, a now-annual event that serves as the beating heart of Japan’s rising indie games scene. It was a positive, uplifting occasion with a ton of talented people in the same raucous room. How many of those developers’ passion and inspiration has roots in Nintendo’s relentless artistry? ""Trust your passion, believe in your dream,"" Iwata said in an inspiring speech at the 2011 Game Developers Conference. ""For 25 years, game developers have made the impossible possible. So I ask you, why would we stop now?"" Satoru Iwata’s time has been cut short far too soon, but his memory will remain as a shining example of the best the video games industry can be.",0.6367921512066885,0.36320784879331147,0.48514559013289565,1219,4.9409351927809677,652,6.25,0,12,"Culture, Entertainment, Gaming, Essay",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

He led Nintendo during the launch of the DS, the 3DS, the Wii, and the Wii U, taking over just as the company was set to launch its GameCube. But while his business accomplishments impress, Iwata will be remembered as more than just a businessman — he offered a charming and human face to a company already beloved by legions of game fans. Iwata's appointment to the position of president and CEO in 2002 was something of a surprise. He was only Nintendo's fourth president in the company's century of existence, and was the first not to come from the Yamauchi family. Not only was he a departure from the Yamauchi bloodline, he was a departure from his predecessor's tone: where Hiroshi Yamauchi was notoriously imperious, Iwata appeared friendly and welcoming. Yamauchi's background was business — he took control of the company at 22 and promptly fired the majority of the managers he inherited from his father's reign — but Iwata's was game development. Iwata started his career at Japanese game studio HAL Laboratory, working as a programmer and helping to create much-loved Kirby games.  He reportedly coded cult classic Earthbound (Mother in Japan) singlehandedly, and even as he was transitioning to upper management, Iwata remained a virtuoso programmer, brought into thorny projects as a code whisperer. In 2001, while already working as general manager of corporate planning, he stepped in to streamline the GameCube version of Super Smash Bros, crushing bugs for three weeks so the game could hit its planned release date. While president of HAL Laboratory, Iwata ported the entire battle system from Game Boy games Pokémon Red and Blue to N64 title Pokémon Stadium on his own, without any design documentation, in a week. Programming was Iwata's background, but he brought a designer's eye to a job that is often focused on keeping investors happy. With the Wii, he helped popularize and standardize motion controls. With the DS, Nintendo introduced touch screens to gaming hardware two years before the iPhone hit the market. Nintendo's latest home console, the Wii U, has not fared as well, but Iwata already teased the company's next hardware project — codenamed NX — earlier this year.  Where Yamauchi loomed in the background, Iwata was often front-and-center of Nintendo's public image, even hosting semi-regular ""Iwata Asks"" panels in which he'd interview developers about upcoming games on Nintendo platforms. The panels were designed to promote new titles, but often offered true insight into the thought processes of big name developers, with Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto and long-time Legend of Zelda producer and director Eiji Aonuma appearing multiple times. Even as company president, his background as a programmer working his way through the ranks of Japanese game development appeared to give him an easy familiarity with ex-colleagues and subordinates at Nintendo, highlighted neatly by this charming three-part interview with Earthbound 2 designer Shigesato Itoi. Written descriptions of these meetings were always peppered with transcribed laughter from Iwata himself.  Iwata capitalized on his softer image in Nintendo marketing, hosting the company's regular Nintendo Live online events, and often joining with Nintendo of America boss Reggie Fils-Aime to make a surprisingly endearing double act. Last year, the two engaged in a fake brawl to promote Nintendo's fighting game Smash Bros, a moodily shot skit that was rapidly turned into GIF form on gaming forums.  Most recently, Iwata appeared in puppet form as part of Nintendo's E3 presentation, one of a trifecta of top-tier Nintendo staff that included Fils-Aime and Miyamoto. The world watched, slightly bemused after two days of businesslike press conferences from Sony, Microsoft, and others, as a plush version of one of Japan's biggest companies slowly turned into a rabbit and gestured silently toward a bunch of bananas.  Those bananas were a reference to a clip from E3 2012, which showed the real Iwata staring intently at a bunch he was holding in his hand. Iwata was able to poke fun at his image, but like Nintendo, never strayed to the cynical. Neither did the other memes that he spawned during his tenure at Nintendo. He famously stated that 2013 would be ""the year of Luigi,"" appearing in a Nintendo Direct video dressed in the character's trademark green hat. The phrase was picked up quickly by the internet at large, and ""why would you do that in this, the year of Luigi!"" became a cry of anguish for a wronged party.  Iwata appeared as a likable figurehead, but players also saw him pushing back against investors and analysts who demanded the company move into the smartphone market and start gouging players with egregious free-to-play mechanics to recoup recent losses. Nintendo finally committed to making smartphone games earlier this year, but appear to be doing so very much on the kind of player-centric course laid out by Iwata's leadership. To program a game is hard. To run a company successfully for 13 years is harder. To appear as the charismatic public face of that company is almost impossible. With him gone, Nintendo loses a rare talent capable of all three, and we lose a man who came to be associated with the best of Nintendo's games — bright, optimistic, and always full of joy.

It makes sitting inside the massive venue a special moment — but it’s also frustrating for fans who may never know what attendees have seen.  One example this weekend was the Legendary Pictures panel. Not only did the company show secret teaser trailers for Krampus and Crimson Peak, but it also took the wraps off an extended preview of Duncan Jones’ Warcraft movie. In this particular case, there’s actually a decent reason why it’s not available online: the presentation took place on three different screens, with a near 270-degree field of view.   Still, you no doubt want to see it, and I’m here to help. With the aid of a Uniball Signo Micro 207 pen and a Moleskine notebook, I’ve recreated the trailer for you. So sit back, open your mind, and enter the world of Warcraft.  Three different screens showed three different studio logos, for a 270-degree cinematic experience. Two orcs — Durotan and Orgrim — walk towards an encampment, chatting about how times are hard in their world. Durotan and his pregnant wife discuss what to name their child. He doesn't want to pick until he meets the newborn. She asks how he'll be able to pick if he's not home with them to begin with?

I had this really weird experience where before we started the movie. I was getting my kid a Halloween costume. And my son is really into Batman.

At first it was just a single blur, something I couldn't make out shooting across the sidewalk. Then it was a big one, causing my neighbor to jump up from her sleep. Soon they were all over the rocks against the bay, people crushing them and shouting in fright all along the line. It was Friday and getting close to midnight, and I was still standing in the overnight line for San Diego Comic-Con's Hall H, where Zack Snyder and the cast of Batman v. Superman would be presenting the next day. Hall H is where all of the biggest panels are held — it's the location of legend at Comic-Con — and if you want to get in, you have to get there early.   I had been waiting for close to 10 hours at that point. For the most part, it hadn't been so bad. I was concerned about being stuck out in the California sun — one person I spoke with had gotten a ""massive sunburn"" on her arm from shielding her face while waiting in line the prior day — but I was fortunate enough to end up so far back in line that I was shaded in the trees of a small park about half a mile away from Hall H. I had a lovely view of the bay, and the cool breeze coming in off the water kept temperatures mild through the afternoon. But as the day went on, things started to go downhill. The air began to get cold. No one in the area was selling food or water. The convention was supposed to issue wristbands so that we could all go home and come back in the morning, but two hours after they were supposed to arrive, we hadn't heard a thing. Also, there were cockroaches. A lot of them. ""He's killed like four so far."" Jill Hanson was sitting in a small group about a hundred people ahead of me. She and two men were all bundled up in sweatshirts, which they'd borrowed from another line-sitter they'd met that night. ""It's kinda disgusting, and it wasn't like this last year,"" Hanson says. ""We've also seen a couple mice jumping around in the rocks."" ""This is ridiculous,"" says Dawn Ragnar, who lent Hanson's group some of her extra clothing. ""Other than the thrill of sitting in Hall H, this is not fun."" The line for Hall H has been getting longer and longer each year, and there's a broad consensus among repeat line sitters that this year is the worst yet. ""It's never been this bad,"" Brenda Arson, who's been coming to Comic-Con for nine years, tells me. Many point to 2009's Twilight panel as the tipping point, when some fans started arriving upward of a day early just to guarantee themselves a seat in the hall. For most people, though, you could arrive only hours early and still get in. At least until these past couple years. ""Now it's become such a thing that you have to stay overnight,"" Arson says. It's around one in the morning and she's wrapped in a thick blanket near the front of the park line. Her group arrived at noon after monitoring the line's growth on Twitter. ""You have to give them half of your convention,"" she says. Around 5 percent of Comic-Con attendees can fit into Hall H Over 6,000 people can fit inside of Hall H. It's an enormous space, but in comparison to the 130,000 people who attend Comic-Con in total, it's nothing. Comic-Con's attendance has been exploding in recent years as its focus goes more mainstream. No longer is it a show about selling back issues of comics and collectible toys: it's a show about movies, TV shows, video games, and all of the biggest franchises. If you're even the slightest bit a geek, there's something for you. Other conventions have ways of dealing with their huge attendance. BlizzCon, VidCon, and Disney's D23 Expo and Star Wars Celebration all used Los Angeles' Anaheim Convention Center, which has about 30 percent more exhibiting space than the San Diego Convention Center. Other conventions use overflow seating into additional rooms, which provide a live stream so that people can still watch the proceedings. Comic-Con could choose to pick up and move, but it hasn't just yet. Earlier this month, the convention made a deal with the city of San Diego to stay around through 2018, so convention attendees can expect at least three more years of ballooning attendance figures and declining free space. But there must be ways to handle the line until then. ""There's a better way to do it. There's a hell of a better way to do it,"" Manuel Robles, whose spot in line put him beside the open doors of a public bathroom, tells me. ""Waiting out here to see if you get in or don't get in is a waste of everyone's time. You miss the panels. You miss the parties."" Comic-Con has already started experimenting with ways to handle the crowd when it comes to other parts of the event. Lines may still be first-come-first-serve, but autographs, purchases of SDCC-exclusive collectibles, and even parking and finding a hotel are in some cases done through a lottery system. Attendees put their name in if they want a chance at getting something signed or buying a new item, and they find out later whether they won or lost. It results in disappointments — someone told me they lost six lotteries the other year when trying to get Guillermo del Toro to sign their Pacific Rim poster — but it removes lines and fights and opens attendees up to actually experience the Con. Those in line for Hall H, even past midnight and trying to sleep beside cockroaches — ""It's better than sleeping with homeless people yesterday in the park,"" one person tells me — largely don't want to see the lottery system come to Hall H. Getting into Hall H is what they come to San Diego for, many told me, and if they lost a raffle, the experience might just feel like a waste of money. Some, like Robles, think it would be unfair. People pay thousands of dollars to travel to and stay in San Diego just for a chance at Hall H — they shouldn't be able to lose out to someone who lives in the city just because that person got lucky. ""Comic-Con prefers that people not wait in line overnight,"" said David Glanzer, Comic-Con’s marketing director, in an email to The Verge. ""However this seems like an increasingly unrealistic appeal. Because of this we try to at least identify a location that can actually accommodate the crowds that may accumulate, which is the reason for its current placement."" Glanzer says that SDCC has been taking steps toward improving the experience in recent years, including hiring a team to maintain the bathroom facilities along the line 24 hours a day. There are also drinking fountains and portable restrooms in the area. But these feel like stopgap measures. Setting up a snaking queue into a park half a mile away and making occasional security strolls is helpful, but it isn't a solution; it isn't going to help the people who enjoy this convention the most really get the most out of their trip. ""Comic-Con takes the well-being of all our attendees very seriously and will review all policies and procedures after the event,"" Glazner says. ""There is no doubt this will be among our many debriefings and discussions."" But with the convention scheduled to return to San Diego for at least three more years, a location change is undoubtedly out of the question. So far, Comic-Con's biggest improvement is the wristband. After the current day's panels are over, a small group of Con employees — one of whom told me, in a justly grumpy manner, that she was on her 14th hour of work at one in the morning — move along the line checking that people have badges and handing out wristbands. Those who get a wristband are, supposedly, guaranteed entry into the next day's first panel so long as they arrive early. But with only a group of about four people, as far as I saw, passing the bands out, it was a slow-moving affair, leaving little time for people to head back to their hotels. It took over three hours before the first people in the park received their wristbands — and there were still hundreds of people to go. When the bands arrived, there was no cheering or excitement, just people waking up from sleep so that they could flash their convention badges. Arson was among them. She described the feeling as ""sweet, sweet, hard-fought victory, because it is freezing and it is unpleasant out here."" But she still stuck around through the night, not trusting the wristband system (it failed to secure her a spot when she received one for Thursday's panels, she says). Others hurried out of the park, looking weary and eager to get some rest. I never ended up getting a wristband. Close to midnight, I stepped out of my spot in line to go speak with others still waiting around. It was liberating, even if it meant missing Batman v. Superman, the biggest panel of the next day. Eventually, I made it into Hall H on Saturday afternoon using a press pass, a luxury that only a couple dozen people get per panel. I saw Quentin Tarantino speak at The Hateful Eight’s panel and then returned a couple hours later for Joss Whedon, who stood up in front of the room's over 6,000 people and took questions from fans. As I was leaving Whedon's panel, I bumped into Arson again. All the despondence from the night before was gone — she'd made it, and now she was just thrilled to be there. Glowing, she leaned over the endless row of chairs toward me, ""Wasn't that amazing?""",0.13758335542657316,0.8624166445734268,0.8506138797109606,1680,4.5440476190476193,755,5.8251655629139076,1,3,"Comic-Con, Culture, Entertainment",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

And if any brand in 2015 would publicly align itself with the near-universally panned body-swapping movie Self/Less, it was Playboy. On Friday night, I took a break from the crowds of Comic-Con to attend a bash the House of Hefner was throwing for the new sci-fi thriller starring Ben Kingsley and Ryan Reynolds, currently clocking in at 20 percent on Rotten Tomatoes. To be clear, this was a party for a bad movie — but I was not deterred. If anything, I wanted to see firsthand how wide the gulf is between pure schlock and crazy branded fun. I wore beige shoes for this occasion. I wanted it to be special The fête was happening at Parq in downtown San Diego. My Lyft driver was excited on my behalf. ""It’s the hottest nightclub in the city,"" he said as we rolled down Broadway, suddenly the Turtle to my Vince. ""Well, the second hottest."" I never did learn what club is the number one hotspot in town (I probably never will), but I couldn’t help but resent Playboy for not pushing the envelope just a little more. I wore beige shoes for this occasion. I wanted it to be special. We got to the club, and Turtle wished me luck, a knowing look in his eyes. I was excited. I’d arrived. After proving my worth with three separate line attendants, I made my way inside. And lo, the beautiful people — journalists, models, Hollywood types alike — were there in all their finery (which is to say tight dresses and lots of gingham), just standing by an inexplicable indoor tree, looking pleased with themselves and their bespoke cocktails. The soundtrack was Diplo and Fetty Wap, and the room seemed to vibrate with the bass. Playboy bunnies bopped here and there, smiling and taking selfies. Trays of sliders and tater tots glided from clique to clique. It looked like the start of a good party. Alone, I resigned myself to the bar, had a drink, and played fly on the wall. The scene felt forced at first. I made small talk with one of the guests. A writer too, she got an awkward vibe from the place, a feeling I couldn’t quite deny. Looking up, I saw LCD screens alternating between Playboy vacation videos and select scenes from Self/Less. And there Ryan was, staring down at us with his bland face, judging us for celebrating his cinematic misfortune for being cast in this flop. It was weird. Kind of discomfiting. I kept drinking. And there Ryan was, staring down at us with his bland face I made my way upstairs to see where else the night could take me, and sure enough there was a dance floor with aerialists hanging from the ceiling. Because obviously. There were smoke cannons firing on either side of the DJ, and everyone was drinking or dancing or both. Models streamed by holding sparklers and champagne. At one point I may have sung along to a Katy Perry song with one of them, but all I remember was clutching the bar with someone who was suddenly my new best friend. Last Night in San Diego #ComicCon A video posted by Kwame Opam (@kwames) on Jul 11, 2015 at 10:09am PDT  Now, I’ve been to promotional PR parties like this before. Nothing about this particular party was all that debauched. But something dawned on me after my third drink. Everyone at this party, whether they were aware of it or not, was a cosplayer. The theme of this party was the kind of excesses of the upper class that Reynolds indulges in in the first third of Self/Less, you know, before he thinks better of sacrificing beautiful yet poorer people for the sake of immortality. Presumably, we were all pretending to be rich and ancient on Playboy’s dime, living out new lives in the bodies of the less fortunate. And the sick twist? It felt good. There was a perverse thrill in pretending to be just one in a roomful of supervillains, reveling in our conquest of the world. The movie got it wrong, I thought. Who needs high-minded moralizing about the effects of runaway wealth when all we want to do is have fun forever? You can't have fun forever without being sick forever, too I woke up the next day with a hangover. Back in the real world. Back with the common folk of Comic-Con. It turns out, you can’t have fun forever without being sick forever, too. And the same goes for the real-life Playboy, which in recent months has been unable to avoid its shady past catching up to it.

Tile says that said beep is three times louder now and will work within 100 feet — both claims ring (ahem) true in my testing. Tile also has another clever feature — if you lose something, you can tell the Tile hive mind and every Tile user's phone will start looking for it. If it's detected, you'll get an alert on your phone — but the user who came near it won't know, protecting your privacy and your stuff. Every phone can become a Tile now Tile has also updated its app: now it lets the Tile system ring your phone if it's lost, effectively creating a backup find-my-phone system. There's a new web app for finding both Tiles and phones, and there's also an Apple Watch app. The new Tile hardware has a button hidden in the logo that you can now double-tap to make your phone ring if it's in Bluetooth range — even if it's on silent. On Android, one sort of annoying thing about the system is that you can't quit the app if you want it to work. That does mean you can kill it and save battery, but it seems like the sort of thing that ought to live in the notification tray.

As co-founder and CTO of software firm Cloudstitch Ted Benson discovered, with some basic programming skills, you can hack them to do almost anything. Benson used a script in programming language Python to repurpose his button; by pushing the button every time his son pooped, the script would log the data instead of ordering more diapers. A dash button is essentially made up of a Wi-Fi radio and a battery, and lies dormant until you press it. Once activated, the button connects to your Wi-Fi, places the set order (in Benson’s case Huggies diapers), and then turns itself off to conserve power. This is key, because it means that the button goes through the same process of getting on your network each time. There are all kinds of uses for an internet-connected button In his post on Medium, Benson explains how he was able to search for the button on his Wi-Fi network, get its MAC address, and have his computer detect each time the button connected to the network; it then logged each instance in a Google Spreadsheet, creating a poop database. He avoided racking up hundreds of dollars in diaper bills by disabling the link between the button and any specific product, so it didn't place any orders. In theory, it’s easy to think of all kinds of uses for an internet-connected button that costs only $4.99 — anything from turning lights on and off, playing music, activating your coffee maker, or tracking the progress of something. There is no end to the smart devices that will relieve you of these and other mundane duties, but they’re also far more expensive.

The protein, called EGFRvIII, occurs in about one-third of glioblastomas. On the basis of the study's results, the researchers are moving into human testing. In this method of treatment, scientists harvest the blood of a person with cancer. Then, in the lab, they use a gene transfer to teach the T cells to target a specific protein. The engineered T cells are then transplanted back into the patient. In the case of blood cancers, the targeted protein is one expressed on the surface of B cells. In this example, the protein is EGFRvIII. ""We had complete tumor control""The patients in this case were mice, with human tumors, who were treated with human T cells as a model of how the treatment might work in people.

The next step is a new trial, which will enroll 12 people whose cancers have the EGFRvIII protein and has already started, she says. The study, which was partially funded by Novartis, hints at the promise of the so-called chimeric antigen receptor T cells, or CAR-T for short.

The actor is about to embark on an expedition in search of the world's loneliest whale — if his Kickstarter project gets funded, that is. The world's loneliest whale was first discovered in 1992 at the Whidbey Island Naval Air Station in Puget Sound. As Leslie Jamison points out in her essay 52 Blue, researchers heard the whale's strange call through a network of hydrophones planted along the ocean floor. The call came in at 52 hertz, hence the whale's nickname ""52."" The frequency is extraordinarily high for blue whales, whose calls usually fall somewhere between 15 and 20 hertz. As scientists studied the whale, they found he was always alone — crushingly, disappointingly alone. Like the plot of a down-and-out country song, no other whales were responding to Lonely Whale's strange, falsetto calls. He's the Tiny Tim of whales The Kickstarter campaign aims to fund a 20-day quest during which Grenier, filmmaker Josh Zeman, and a team of scientists will track the whale, who is now considered to be a rare hybrid of a blue and a fin whale. The crew will travel 400 miles off the coast of California, and, if they find the whale, they'll attempt to clip him with non-invasive tags to monitor his calls. While on the journey, Grenier and Zeman will shoot a documentary about how ocean noise pollution (mostly from humans) is disrupting whales' ability to communicate with each other. ""Much like the plight of the Lonely Whale,"" the Kickstarter story reads, ""we too are struggling to be heard above the endless chatter of our plugged-in lives."" In an interview with Origin, Grenier said, ""Lonely whales have the ability to bring people in,"" noting that the whale ""reflects a humanness, something that’s within all of us.""

The report, published today by the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee, suggests that taxes on sugary foods could be used to fund other health efforts — such as educational programs or anti-obesity initiatives — or to subsidize the cost of fruits and vegetables. The recommendations come in response to ""major public health concerns"" around obesity, type 2 diabetes, and other medical issues caused or exaggerated by sugar intake.  It will take more than taxes to lower sugar intake, the report says The committee's report is a lengthy, well over 500-page document filled with findings and recommendations on nutrition that the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Agriculture will use to inform the 2015 update to ""The Dietary Guidelines for Americans."" The guidelines are updated every five years. The committee, filled with government-appointed experts, is tasked with delivering a report on the latest scientific findings ahead of each update, though the government is not required to accept its recommendations. The final guidelines are due out later this year. The recommendations say that the general population should try to keep their added sugar intake to no more than 10 percent of their total daily calories. The report recommends removing sugar from school lunches and encouraging people to drink water as well. Notably, and as previously reported, the committee also drops prior recommendations that cholesterol intake should be limited, citing no findings linking consumption of cholesterol to cholesterol in the blood. There are a handful of other changes — including recommendations on coffee consumption — that are nicely summed up over at Vox. Taxing sugary substances is not without precedent, though it remains rare and controversial and is certain to be opposed by soda, candy, and other sweets manufacturers. And even if the recommendations make it through into the final guidelines, they'll still be just that: guidelines. The report recommends tailoring approaches within communities and neighborhoods, and that may be how a tax on sugar could most easily be implemented and properly targeted. The committee believes that it will take more than just a tax to appropriately address the growing health issues linked to sugar, however. It writes, ""Policies and programs at local, state, and national levels in both the private sector and public sector are necessary to support efforts to lower added sugars in beverages and foods and to limit availability of sugar-sweetened beverages and snacks.""",0.7526585615383656,0.24734143846163437,0.8377723727021534,433,5.415704387990762,246,6.4308943089430892,0,0,"Policy & Law, Science, US & World",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The researchers are eager to begin human trials The treatment works by injecting a subject with a harmless virus that prompts the body to create a protein of the researchers' design. That protein is then able to block parts of the virus that are used for latching onto cells, thus preventing it from spreading. The treatment was tested on four rhesus monkeys. According to The Wall Street Journal, it was able to prevent the monkeys from being infected with SHIV — a version of HIV used in simian trials — even when they were exposed to 16 times the amount of virus that was needed to infect monkeys that hadn't received the treatment. Those levels are said to be far beyond what a human might encounter during HIV transmission.

Throughout the month, Bill will be sharing his vision of how technology will revolutionize life for the world's poor by 2030 by narrating episodes of the Big Future, our animated explainer series. In addition, we'll be publishing a series of features exploring the improvements in banking, health, farming, and education that will enable that revolution. And while the topics reflect the bets Bill and his wife Melinda are making with their foundation, they've asked us for nothing less than fully independent Verge journalism, which we're more than happy to deliver. Turns out Bill Gates is a pretty confident guy. Nilay Patel, Editor-in-Chief Depending on who you ask, genetically modified organisms, or GMOs, are the solution to malnutrition and hunger in the developing world, or a threat to food sovereignty. Take Uganda, for example. Ugandans eat, on average, a pound of bananas daily — more than any other population. But this crucial resource has been threatened by a bacterial wilt disease, which turns the banana plant’s sap into ooze, wilts the leaves, rots the fruit, and eventually destroys the crop. Banana wilt was first seen in Uganda in 2001, and neither pesticides nor chemicals have stopped it. Farmers tried to control the wilt’s spread by torching infected plants and disinfecting tools, but the disease cut Ugandan banana yields by as much as half from 2001 to 2004. In the country’s central region, wilt hit 80 percent of plants, and sometimes knocked out whole fields, according to a report from The Guardian. So scientists at Uganda’s National Agricultural Research Organization (NARO) — which receives funding from the Gates Foundation — created a genetically modified banana by inserting a green pepper gene into the banana’s genome. The new gene seems to trigger a process that kills infected cells and saves the plant. NARO wants to give the seeds away for free, but no regulation exists around GMOs in Uganda, and Uganda is obligated to take a cautionary approach to GMO technology, as signer of 2000’s Cartagena protocol. The Ugandan government is considering passing a law that would allow the introduction of GMOs, including the bacteria-resistant banana, but some food scientists worry it may open the door to corporate exploitation by multinational companies like Monsanto down the line. This year, the Gates Foundation’s annual letter points to innovations in farming as a revolution that will transform the lives of the poor over the next 15 years, particularly in Africa. Food is a fundamental human right; nonetheless, people are starving. The UN’s World Food Programme estimates over 800 million individuals, or one in nine people on the planet, struggle to find enough food to eat on a regular basis. In places like Sub-Saharan Africa, hunger is a tremendous problem — and an ironic one. The region is home to abundant arable land; 70 percent of the population there farms. But the prevalence of hunger there is also the highest in the world — one in five people are undernourished. Chronic malnutrition has stunted the growth of 40 percent of children under the age of five, according to UNICEF. That’s 25 million kids. A new generation of highly productive crops, Gates suggests, are part of the solution to address global hunger — seeds that are drought-resistant, disease-resistant, productive, and nutritious could benefit farmers. Some of the crops can be bred through traditional methods, but Gates thinks many African countries will adopt GMOs, or genetically modified organisms. GMOs are an accelerated version of the traditional methods of plant breeding which require raising several generations of plants, improving their yield or drought-tolerance properties over years if not decades. But genetic information lets scientists tweak specific genes — a much faster process. It also expands the range of possible alterations, since genes from one species can be inserted into another. The first American GMO crop was the Flavr Savr tomato, created by California company Calgene and green-lit by the US Food and Drug Administration in 1994. The modified tomatoes didn’t get squishy as quickly as regular tomatoes. Though Flavr Savr tomatoes are no longer sold — turns out, it’s more economical to ship green tomatoes — genetic modifications caught on and proved more successful in other foods. More than 90 percent of soybeans and 80 percent of corn sold in the US today are GMOs created by companies like Monsanto, Cargill, and Dupont. GMO seeds are often more expensive than conventionally bred varieties, a concern voiced by some opponents of Uganda’s bill. GMOs have been widely touted as a solution to hunger and malnutrition: engineering for specific traits, like the wilt-resistant banana in Uganda, they could make farmers less vulnerable to crop loss. ""GMO-derived seeds will provide far better productivity, better drought tolerance, salinity tolerance, and if the safety is proven, then the African countries will be among the biggest beneficiaries,"" Bill Gates told The Verge. (The Gates Foundation Asset Trust, which manages the foundation's assets, has previously held shares of Monsanto. The trust hasn't held shares of Monsanto ""for a few years"" says Alex Reid, a foundation spokesperson, who adds that the trust is managed separately and doesn't get input into what the foundation funds. The trust's 990 tax form lists all holdings at the end of the fiscal year — you can see the most recent one here.)   The Gates Foundation suggests that by using better fertilizer and more productive crops such as GMOs, African farmers could ""theoretically double their yields."" (The average yield per acre in Africa is one-fifth of that in the US.)  ""With the right investments,"" the Gates letter goes on, it may be possible for farmers on the continent to ""increase productivity by 50 percent overall."" The Foundation believes so strongly in the promise of farming that in 2013 it spent 22 percent of its $1.8 billion global development expenditure on agriculture. But even if GMO crops yield more produce, will that translate to less hunger? Lowered production is an issue, certainly. Once, Africa was a major food exporter, sending out coffee, cocoa, and spices — but the price of commodities dropped in the 1980s, and imports have outpaced exports. Food production has mostly been stagnant since then, while consumption has grown, according to the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization. Today, African countries spend $35 billion to $40 billion a year on imported food. Relying heavily on imports raises the price of regionally produced food, contributing to a cycle of poverty. Increasing production, however, may be a red herring: according to the World Food Programme, the planet actually produces enough food to feed everyone alive more than 2,000 calories a day. But global funding priorities remain ""heavily focused on increasing agricultural production,"" according to a 2013 report from the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. ""The perception that there is a supply-side problem is, however, questionable,"" the report reads. ""Hunger and malnutrition are mainly related to a lack of purchasing power and/or the inability of the rural poor to be self-sufficient. Meeting the food security challenges is primarily about the empowerment of the poor and their food sovereignty."" In other words: the primary problem isn’t technology, it’s distribution. Poverty exacerbates the issue: in some developing countries, farmers can’t afford the seeds they plant to feed their families; some are too poor to even feed themselves well, limiting their ability to work, earn more money, or invest in their own farms. ""In a lot of famines, you have food leaving the famine areas, because buying power has collapsed,"" says Gawain Kripke, the director of policy and research at Oxfam America. (Oxfam America has previously received funding from the Gates Foundation.) ""It’s not supply or availability of food. There’s just no buying power."" Farmers in Africa are also politically weak, says Kripke. As a result, countries’ policies favor urban consumers in budget allocations. That makes it difficult for farmers to lobby for the changes they’d need to create a functioning agricultural supply chain. The stance is supported by the UN’s FAO, which says, in a 2014 report, that the keys to progress in nutrition include ""sustained political commitment to food security at the highest level,"" as well as policies that give a voice to politically weak groups. The Gates Foundation donated $12 million to the FAO last year. But even assuming the technology makes it to the needy, farmers don’t necessarily have a reason to grow more food than they can eat themselves. Without basic infrastructure like markets, storage, and trade agreements, there’s little they can do with the extra produce. Of the 54 states within the African Union, only 10 have allocated at least a tenth of their public investments to agriculture — that is, to infrastructure, irrigation, research, and development. Without markets, international trade, places to store surplus harvests, and irrigation, it’s hard to encourage farmers to invest in growing more than they need. About 30 percent of crops produced in Africa are lost after harvest, says Agnes Kalibata, the president of the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa, an agricultural organization founded with funds from the Gates Foundation and the Rockefeller Foundation in 2006. Her group hopes to change that. Before heading up AGRA, Kalibata was the minister of Rwanda’s Agriculture and Animal Resources. Between 2004 and 2014, Rwanda more than doubled its crop production by increasing agriculture investment from 3.5 percent to 7.2 percent of government expenditures. That investment reduced poverty by almost a third, according to AGRA’s statistics. Using the lessons Kalibata learned in Rwanda, AGRA is trying to promote policy changes, including increased government investment, across the continent. ""One policy breakthrough in one country could be a big breakthrough for everyone,"" she says. In 2013, the Gates Foundation awarded the group $4 million for policy change and about $23 million for education and technology. AGRA advocates for basic, but wide-reaching structural changes: for instance, Africa has no continent-wide regulations on grades, standards, weights, or measures — all of which complicate trade. There are also no strong regulations on how food should be stored in warehouses, which may mean losses for farmers if the storehouses aren’t up to grade. Customs procedures are often cumbersome, and vary widely — which drive up the cost of transactions. ""All the infrastructure we take for granted in a modern agricultural supply chain doesn’t exist [in Africa],"" says Oxfam America’s Kripke. ""So where do you start? Seeds? Roads?"" Roads are a safe bet, according to International Food Policy Research Institute. In fact, they’re one of the best investments governments can make. Not only do they get seeds and other agricultural products and technology into an area, roads are crucial for trade. Without access to roads, farmers tend to buy seeds at high prices and sell produce at lower ones, which exposes them to more risk from food price fluctuations. Sometimes, farmers are unable to sell their crops at all. And when that happens, farmers become apathetic about adopting new technology: what’s the point of increasing yield if most of it will rot, anyway? Infrastructure investment has a proven impact: the introduction of roads in 15 rural villages in Ethiopia increased consumption by households by about 16 percent, while lowering poverty about 7 percent, according to a 2008 IFPRI study. More roads may also mean more information: currently agricultural extension programs — which help train farmers and educate them about the marketplace — can be tough for farmers to reach. That’s particularly true for about half of African farmers: women, who are less able to travel because of familial responsibilities or the hazards of the road. ""Gender is a pretty big concern,"" says Kripke. ""Especially women farmers have trouble,"" AGRA’s Kalibata says. And farm education is an area where women especially stand to gain, says Calestous Juma, a professor at Harvard’s Kennedy School of Government and director of the Science, Technology, and Globalization Project at the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs. Juma also serves as the director of Agricultural Innovation in the Africa Project, which the Gates Foundation funds. All these factors come into play in Uganda. In this sub-Saharan nation of 37 million, bananas are essential  — about 75 percent of farmers grow them there. The country depends on agriculture for 23 percent of its gross domestic product. But like other countries in the region, Uganda suffers from a dearth of infrastructure. Though the country is only slightly smaller than the UK, it has only 2,028 miles (3,264 km) of paved roads, compared to the UK’s 245,068 miles (394,428 km). That makes trade and transit quite difficult, especially since 85 percent of Uganda’s 36 million people live in rural areas. A quarter of the population is below the poverty line. As a result, almost 40 percent of children there are undernourished, according to the US government’s Feed the Future initiative. Can the genetically modified bananas have a positive impact for millions of Ugandans? Uganda’s wilt-resistant banana is the best possible scenario for GMO adoption, in some respects. The strain was created by local scientists and, because it’s being distributed for free, won’t lead to capital from farmers flowing out of the country. But some activists are concerned that the banana GMO will open the door to other crops with pernicious consequences. ""Farmers have been told that the GMOs are almost the same as non-GMOs,"" Ellady Muyambi, an environmental scientist at the Uganda Network on Toxic Free Malaria, told NPR. ""But they would have to go to a company to buy the seeds. Many farmers can’t afford expensive seeds. They would have no rights."" Hunger in Uganda is a bigger issue than the impact of one GMO law: evidence suggests that improving farmer education programs and infrastructure investment can have a bigger impact than increasing productivity alone. Without infrastructure — roads, granaries, markets, irrigation — and policy changes, more food won’t eliminate hunger. And while GMOs like the wilt-resistant banana may save critical crops, it’s not clear they can ensure food security in hungry communities. And Uganda has bigger problems on the horizon. According to the Brookings Institute, Uganda should expect inflation in 2015 — the result of government borrowing, a depletion of foreign currency reserves, and cutbacks on essential supplies — that will ""widen the income gap"" and ""reverse the gains made in poverty reduction."" In other words: the economic situation in Uganda is set to reduce the purchasing power of the impoverished. If the Brookings Institute is right, that means hunger, with or without genetically modified bananas.

The 571-page report published by the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee (DGAC) was dismissed as ""flawed"" and ""nonsensical"" by representatives of the meat industry. Soda makers joined in the criticism, saying the panel of experts had gone ""beyond its scope"" and that high intensity sweeteners criticized by the panel ""can be an effective tool in weight loss."" Although the report has no legal powers, it's very likely that the government will implement its advice. This will inform new public health campaigns and set federal policy for things like school lunches, which is a program worth $16 billion annually. The report also recommends for the first time ever that Americans consider the sustainability of their food. As with the advice for healthy eating, this means simply eating less meat and more vegetables and plants. The advice is straightforward and familiar Even those of us that love a burger and Coke will recognize the DGAC's advice is hardly radical. ""A healthy dietary pattern is higher in vegetables, whole grains, low- or non-fat dairy, seafood, legumes, and nuts,"" says the report, ""[It's] moderate in alcohol (among adults); lower in red and processed meats; and low in sugar-sweetened foods and drinks and refined grains."" Surprisingly, however, the report did repeal decades-old advice that individuals limit their intake of cholesterol, noting that there was no clear link between foods high in the nutrient (e.g. eggs and seafood) and health problems. coffee, thankfully, gets a thumbs-up Thankfully, for the caffeine-addicted among us, the report gives the thumbs-up to moderate coffee consumption, noting that drinking three to five cups of coffee a day ""is not associated with increased long-term health risks."" However, the panel added that Americans tended to underestimate their coffee consumption and that three to five cups a day was equal to only two or three servings from Starbucks. They also highlighted the dangers of energy drinks with high caffeine content, saying that children and adolescents should drink them sparingly, or better still, not at all. Adults should also avoid consuming energy drinks and alcohol together — whether ""mixed together or consumed at the same sitting."" This means popular drinks like Red Bull and vodka should be off the cards for those trying to stay healthy. The panel also mooted the idea of a tax on sugary drinks and foods. As well as recommending that Americans consider the sustainability of their diet, the report highlights the meat industry as a particular environmental concern. ""Current evidence shows that the average U.S. diet has a larger environmental impact in terms of increased greenhouse gas emissions, land use, water use and energy use,"" said the report. ""This is because the current U.S. population intake of animal-based foods is higher and plant-based foods are lower."" Beef uses 28 times more land than pork or poultry The meat industry described the panel's ""foray into the murky waters of sustainability"" as ""well beyond its scope and expertise,"" and pointed out that although the carbon footprint of meat was higher than plants, the two do not deliver an equal amount of nutrients. This is true, of course, but the ratio of environmental impact to nutritional output is not something that can be easily measured. Even among livestock there is much variation. Beef, for example, needs 28 times more land and 11 times more irrigation water than pork and poultry. Although the government is free to ignore the DGAC's advice, the chances are it won't, said former member Marion Nestle, a professor of nutrition at New York University. Nestle describes the 2015 report as a ""dramatic departure"" for the panel, which has previously recommended eating meat as a way to reduce saturated fat intake. ""The one thing the Dietary Guidelines have never been allowed to do is say clearly and explicitly to eat less of anything,"" Nestle told Politico. ""This committee is not burying anything, or obfuscating ...They’re just telling it like it is.""

Unlike the Apollo missions — which Orion has often been compared to — beleaguered astronauts won't be pulled onto rescue boats from the capsule at sea. Instead, Orion crew members will wait until they are in the well deck aboard the Anchorage before they are allowed out of the capsule. It's a process the Navy has been working on since 2013, one that is meant to take advantage of the breadth of medical facilities, helicopters, radar equipment, and boats that these landing platform-dock ships are equipped with.

Today the two space enthusiasts watched gleefully as the Orion spacecraft rocketed away from Cape Canaveral, circled Earth twice, and splashed down off the coast of Baja California in the Pacific Ocean at 10:29AM Eastern. A product of years of work and anticipation, the uncrewed Orion Exploration Test Flight-1 took exactly 4 hours and 24 minutes. And White, an aerospace engineer for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, was crucial to making it all work.     ""It was indescribable,"" she says. ""The crowd got quiet during the countdown, we were all holding our breath, hoping nothing would go wrong. And when it went off it was so loud, so huge. It was just amazing."" White is one of the many researchers responsible for Orion’s heat shield. This reflective, flammable blanket is crucial to the spacecraft’s ultimate mission: sending humans to Mars and bringing them back safely. It’s been White’s job since 2010 to predict temperature and airflow around the heat shield during takeoff and landing.  She’s been counting down to today for months. ""These last few days have just been watching, waiting, and getting more and more excited,"" she says. Yesterday, the intended launch was repeatedly delayed by stray boats, wind gusts, and technical problems — and that was ""a bit of an emotional roller coaster,"" she says. ""It goes to show you so many things have to go right for a space launch – the weather, all of the systems, the rocket, as well as the payload."" ""I’ll be high off of this for a few weeks,"" she says. Like a lot of kids, she wanted to work for NASA. As a little girl she admired her grandfathers, who were both engineers. In school she excelled in math and science and started to love space after a middle school project on the cosmos. She studied aerospace engineering, hoping to work on spaceflight. ""Part of me thought it was a pipe dream,"" she says, ""something I’d never get to work on."" The first day on her dream job was actually a let-down. On February 1, 2010 — her first day — NASA’s Constellation program, the George W. Bush-era plan to return humans to the moon via Ares I and Ares V rockets, was cancelled. ""I had been brought on to help with Constellation, so I was a bit nervous,"" White says. Her boss assured her though that something new and cool would be coming her way. She’s worked on Orion ever since. the first day of her dream job at nasa was actually a let-down. the project she had been hired for was cancelled. Today’s test flight is crucial for her to continue her work. After all the data is recovered White and her team will have a lot of work to do evaluating how well their predictions stacked against the harsh reality of space.   ""There is a lot at stake for this flight test because we really need this data to refine our design and to know how the parts of Orion perform together,"" White says. ""We have our models and our simulations, and while we do the best that we can, there could be parts that we missed or didn’t know existed. You can’t know what you don’t know, right?""   NASA has sent humans beyond Earth many times, notably during 11 Apollo moon missions between 1968 and 1972. But Orion is to be the most ambitious crewed mission to date, representing a renewed hunger for space exploration. This spacecraft is meant to travel farther, faster, and carry more astronauts than ever before, and it’s hoped that Orion will be the safest space vehicle built to date. If all goes according to schedule, Orion will put humans on an asteroid by 2025 and on Mars in the 2030s. Here’s how crazy it all is: in June, a blue-ribbon panel issued a highly critical report, questioning whether the agency was currently on the right track. The congressionally charted Committee on Human Spaceflight suggested focusing more exclusively on reaching Mars. In response, NASA essentially yawned. orion could put humans on an asteroid by 2025 and ON MARS IN 2030-2040 Orion bears a striking resemblance to the Apollo crafts, and that’s no mistake. ""The theme of Orion is recreating Apollo with 21st century modern technology,"" says John Balboni, an engineer at the NASA Ames Research Center. Balboni has worked in the arc jet test facility for the past 30 years, testing heat-shielding materials in a plasma wind-tunnel.   ""We can’t just reuse the old designs,"" he says. The engineers who created materials such as the Apollo heat shield left documentation, but few of them are around anymore. ""It’s like trying to make a cake from your grandmother’s recipe,"" he says. ""She could leave you all the ingredients and all the steps, but you’re not going to make a cake as good as your grandmother made."" That’s not all. In the decades since the Apollo missions, new materials, such as high-temperature ceramics, have been invented and some old materials have been improved. Other components used years ago, such as asbestos, were phased out after they were found to be toxic. For Orion’s shield NASA redeveloped Avcoat, a combination of fiberglass and high-tech plastics, that was used, in an earlier form, for Apollo’s heat shield. ""IT'S LIKE TRYING TO MAKE A CAKE FROM YOUR GRANDMOTHER'S RECIPE."" The shield is crucial to the success of the mission because getting humans into and home from deep space requires hurling them around as fast as possible. The faster a craft’s trip through the atmosphere, the more kinetic energy is transferred into heat. A capsule returning from the moon smacks into the atmosphere at about 25,000 miles per hour. The heat shield reaches about 5,000º F at this speed. If Orion makes the return journey from Mars someday, it’ll enter the atmosphere at an estimated 33,500 miles per hour, heating the heat shield to near 5,500º F. The air around it, as it travels in a plasma fireball, is about twice as hot as the surface of the sun. That much heat puts intense stress on materials, and if your heat shield fails, the entire vehicle can be lost. ""We’ve seen failures of the heat shield on the shuttle mission,"" says White. ""Hot gas was able to get inside the structure and cause things to explode and burn up."" In 2003, space shuttle Columbia disintegrated as some of heat-protective tiles failed just before landing, killing all seven crew members aboard. Today, after saying goodbye to Florida, Orion sped through the atmosphere. On the surface of the craft, the noise was estimated to be about 100 times louder than a rock concert. Orion circled the earth twice, reaching as high as 3,600 miles on the second loop – 15 times higher than the International Space Station. When Orion slammed back into the atmosphere at 20,000 mph (about 30 times the speed of sound) the heat shield survived an estimated 4,000º F. If it worked as intended, about 20 percent of the shield burned up on the way down, further dissipating heat. ""the most perfect flight you could imagine."" After about five minutes into its ride through the atmosphere, slowing down to about 300 mph, Orion began firing parachutes. These parachutes, 11 in total, unfurled in a multi-stage Kevlar-nylon ballet. With their help, Orion decelerated from 300 mph to just 20 mph in five minutes, slow enough for a graceful splashdown. ""It turned out to be the most perfect flight you could imagine,"" said Rob Navias, NASA TV commentator as Orion splashed down. The spacecraft is now floating in the water, soon to be recovered by two US Navy ships. The USS Anchorage will collect the crew module, while the salvage ship, the USNS Salvor, will recover jettisoned hardware like parachutes and the forward bay cover, which protects the upper part of the spacecraft. I get a text from Molly just after the splashdown. """"We made it!!"" she writes. The precious data White wants is now bobbing in the Pacific, aboard the crew module. More than 1000 sensors aboard Orion recorded conditions during the flight: the stress, vibration, temperature, acceleration, pressure — all the crucial information to prepare for a flight that will include people. It’s been an exciting day for White. She and her team will spend the day basking in the glow of a successful test. But Monday she goes back to work. After all, Mars is still a long way off.",0.520740212341676,0.479259787658324,0.8524624718173688,1447,4.7892190739460956,726,6.1170798898071626,0,20,"Science, Transportation, Report",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

It turns out that the 20-year-old self-taught user-experience designer might be mocking up concepts that are similar to what Microsoft is preparing for the next major version of Windows. Recent reports suggest Microsoft is planning to bring back the Start menu, along with improvements to its traditional desktop mode to allow new Windows 8-style applications to “float” and run in separate windows. Machalani’s concepts — which were completed long before the recent rumors — imagine how that might work in reality. Speaking to The Verge, Machalani enthusiastically explains he “left school to build a better way for students to work” as part of an upcoming collaborative platform currently in development. His work on a Windows 8 concept is a part-time hobby borne out of frustration. The basic concepts center on bringing back the traditional Start menu in a modern way with Live Tiles and easy access to settings in the desktop mode. “I’m not aiming to get anything out of it … this is really to voice some concerns that users have and to show Microsoft that there is a way for them to continue their strategy, but also respect the feedback from users.”  Machalani’s concept brings back the Start menu on the desktop in a way that makes sense. Complete with the Live Tiles found from the Start screen and Windows Phone, the menu is designed to be flexible in size, with a search interface and quick options to access notifications, settings, and power options. It also brings back some of the useful parts of the Windows 7 Start menu: recent and pinned apps. ""My goal was to find a way for everything to work,"" says Machalani. ""You need to find a way for the Start screen’s core idea to work on the desktop too."" It might seem like a minor point, but for existing Windows users the Start menu on Windows 7 acts as a simple location that’s unobtrusive and quick to locate with a keyboard and mouse. Windows 8’s Start screen is a full-screen menu that obscures any apps you’re currently using, a common complaint surrounding the split between desktop and ""Metro.""  Some existing third-party Start menu replacements attempt to bring back the old-style menu, but Machalani believes this is the wrong approach. ""By doing a new Start menu you’re actually bringing the Start screen to the desktop with the same typography, your own user icon … a reflection of how the Start screen can be on the desktop, a more compressed version with more functionality."" In the concept samples the Start menu looks modern, and it fits with the style of Windows 8 without the obtrusiveness of the new full-screen Start screen. It’s a compromise that might work well, giving access to important settings and useful Live Tiles that flicker with information.  Machalani has also turned his attention to other parts of the desktop: stylizing the icons, typography, and matching folder colors as well as other UI elements with the accent color of the Start screen. He’s also mocked up ideas for Windows 8-style apps that break away from the ""Metro"" world and float on the desktop. Referring to Stardock’s ModernMix, an app that allows Windows 8-style apps to run in windows on the desktop, Machalani describes this approach as ""a hack."" Instead, Machalani wants to see quick access to minimize, full-screen, and close buttons at the top of each app, alongside a Charms menu. The existing Charms menu for Windows 8 is tricky to access if you’re a desktop user, especially if you have multiple monitors. If Microsoft is planning to allow its new apps to run windowed on the desktop then Machalani’s concept would make things a little easier to navigate. Machalani also proposes a method to create hybrid applications that switch seamlessly from desktop to Metro. If Microsoft executes well on allowing Windows 8-style apps to run on the desktop then this hybrid would be seamless by itself, but Machalani’s ideas ensure that desktop apps are relevant to their usage (keyboard and mouse), while still remaining optimized for touch when you switch. Other enhancements include simple access to exact battery percentages in the ""Metro"" environment, something Microsoft only currently provides with a tiny visual clue.  Ultimately, Machalani’s concepts are designed to highlight what could be possible if Microsoft pays some attention to the desktop environment and the little pieces of Windows design it often overlooks. Microsoft’s lack of attention to iconography over the years has often been criticized, but the company’s new focus on design has led to an impressive environment for touch-enabled devices. The main criticism of Microsoft’s latest OS is the confusing and jarring switching between desktop and ""Metro,"" something the company has tried to address in the 8.1 update, and a problem that needs more solutions. Machalani is one of the many providing feedback alongside hundreds of designers that have offered their own take on the Windows look over the years. ""I’d like to create a department in Microsoft where their only job is a bunch of designers only using the OS and pointing out all the little things,"" Machalani explains. While he doesn’t have all the answers, the mere fact that Microsoft is considering changes to bring back the Start menu highlights the feedback on its big bet. With lots of users still pointing out little niggles in Windows 8.1 it’s clear more needs to be done. Machalani’s concept is one approach, but Microsoft needs to find the perfect balance for its millions of users. All images copyright and published with the permission of Jay Machalani.

The shoes, which he's developing with University of Southern Denmark professor Martin Hanczyc, are 3D printed from a synthetic biological material that can repair itself overnight. The running shoes are the product of Aden's study of protocells. The basic protocell molecules are not themselves alive, but can be combined to create living organisms. Mixing different protocells creates different properties, and allows them to be programmed to behave differently depending on heat, light, and pressure. The shoes' unique construction allows them to be 3D printed to the exact size of the user's foot, so they would fit like a second skin. While running, the shoes would react to pressure and movement, providing extra cushioning when needed. ""The cells have the capability to inflate and deflate and to respond to pressure,"" Aden tells Dezeen. ""As you're running on different grounds and textures it's able to inflate or deflate depending on the pressure you put onto it and could help support you as a runner.""  After the run, the shoes would be placed in a jar filled with living liquid protocell. The liquid works almost as a recharger or a reviver, keeping the living organisms in the shoes healthy and helping them rejuvenate. The liquid can also be dyed any color, so the shoes would take on the hue of its liquid protocell charger. It's an interesting concept that not only blurs the line between living and non-living organisms, but also pushes the boundaries of 3D printing. According to Aden, the technology is nearly here, and these shoes could become a reality by 2050.",0.74380382310251,0.25619617689748997,0.5035974381863243,287,5.0522648083623691,179,5.977653631284916,0,0,"Design, Concepts",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

This month in Oslo, Norway, architecture student Martin McSherry presented a ""vertical cemetery"" design to the Oslo Conference for Nordic Cemeteries and Graveyards as a solution to the country's growing burial land problem. The white, airy skyscraper design looks almost like a gigantic honeycomb with triangular caverns. According to McSherry, the building would feature ""an adjoining, permanent crane"" that would lift coffins up to the empty slots. The tower would also grow over time, using the crane to add more slots as more burial space is needed. Not surprisingly, the proposal was met with a ton of protests, but also had a few supporters.  Norway has been dealing with a land scarcity problem for a while. The country has put systems into place to address the burial land concern, such as allotting just two decades for a person in their burial spot before the land is reused for another body. The situation got so bad that a new industry popped up: some graveyard workers started injecting coffins from above with a limestone compound that speeds up the decomposition process of bodies so spaces would become free faster. But even that hasn't fixed the problem, and now there are few, if any, burial sites left for Norwegians who have passed on. There are few, if any, burial sites left Many countries are in the same position as Norway, including the United States. Urban planning professor Chris Coutts told Atlantic Cities that if all the 76 million Americans expected to die between 2024 and 2042 were to be buried, it would require a 130-square-mile parcel of land, around the size of Las Vegas. The skyscraper design might be new, but vertical burial sites are not. People have been creating them for ages, not only for space conservation, but because they simply get the job done. Necropoli have popped up all over European nations as they've invested in stacked burial plots. Even New Orleans has turned to vertical plots to avoid damage to caskets from floods and storms in low-lying cities. The tallest cemetery in the world, however, is in Brazil: the Memorial Necropole Ecumenica has been home to the city's dead for 28 years, keeping thousands of bodies in its 32 stories. All of those vertical cemeteries have something that the skyscraper design currently doesn't have: a separation between life and death. Norwegians may have had a visceral reaction against the design because, as a society, we worry about the moral issue of death, preserving the dignity of the dead, and our discomfort of death being put on display. The grand and ostentatious qualities of a skyscraper aren't what we're used to associating with our dead. But we might have to in the future, as space continues to vanish.

At AT&T Park in San Francisco, I think it’s paying $11 for a beer. But for Apple, here (and eventually in other places) it’s using your credit card to do it. You know, that small piece of plastic that you need to lug around in your pocket, and that has a bunch of sensitive information in plain sight. The credit card is far from dead. But like with CDs and iTunes, Apple's trying to get rid of the pesky plastic part and take everything digital. And not just in online stores and in apps, but in the real world too. Its solution is Apple Pay, which lets you store those same cards on your iPhone, and soon on your wrist with the Apple Watch. At AT&T Park, where the San Francisco Giants play, there’s been a scramble to get the new payment system up and running in time for The World Series so that people can leave their plastic cards at home. I did just that, or at least I tried to. I went on to the game on Friday because Apple and MasterCard took a handful of journalists to show how  Apple Pay works in a stadium that is completely packed with people who buy lots of things. Their own demo was buying garlic fries, though the broader vision is to let you buy nearly everything, everywhere. My own goal was to not only to see how well Apple Pay works (or doesn't) in a place these companies have designed as a showcase, but also one that let me compare that to using a plain old credit card for the same types of purchases. As it turns out, Major League Baseball is doing something similar. It’s using these two top teams to demo the technology, so that other clubs will want to put it in their stadiums during the off season. The end goal is to make it easier for people to buy things at games. ""This is why we do these things this time of year, so we can have these types of rollouts to get some experience so other clubs can take a look, and we’re confident that those clubs will be as into it as the Giants and the Royals are,"" says Adam Ritter, the SVP of Wireless for MLB Advanced Media. Apple announced Apple Pay last month alongside the iPhone 6 and Apple Watch, but the league didn’t know which clubs would make it all the way here. ""We had to start with the division series thinking about eight clubs,"" Ritter says. ""Then we could narrow our focus.""  In a month’s time, the result is 114 terminals in the entire stadium that work with the technology. That’s about half as many as the 226 that were deployed in time for the first two games in Kansas City earlier this week, though Ritter says that the placement here has been strategic. You won’t be able to hold your phone up to the guy selling peanuts, but you will be able to use it when you’re buying food or memorabilia at some, but not all of the stadium’s vendors. My Apple Pay shopping spree included spending $5.25 on a bottle of water, and another $5.25 on a hot dog. The items were purchased from different vendors in the stadium, with different cards that were in my Apple Pay wallet (both attached to my own personal credit cards, one of which is an embarrassing VISA card with Mickey Mouse on it). Just like using the technology in Apple's demos last month, and in stores earlier this week, Apple Pay took just a few seconds from the time I touched my phone to when the transaction was over. The entire experience was ultimately way less exciting (and memorable) than weaving through a packed crowd to put mustard on my hot dog. But that’s also the point of it. It’s supposed to be the shortest part of buying something. Each purchase was less than $25, so there was nothing to sign. In fact, the longest part of the whole experience was waiting for the Touch ID sensor to fully read my print, which took about two seconds. The $11 beer and $7 Bavarian pretzel I bought later on with a normal credit card was another story. Along with having to break out my wallet for the credit card, I had to fish out my ID. It was perhaps a good example of how Apple Pay is not the perfect solution for everything. Even if I had used it here, the longest part of the transaction wasn’t the ordering and ringing it up, but waiting in line. And I would have still needed something besides my phone to get the job done. Trimming down big lines are one of the things that makes Apple Pay and other mobile wallets so potentially useful. If you can cut down on the fussing at the checkout stand, you’re happy and so is the person behind you. That same experience cannot suddenly happen everywhere Apple Pay appears, including grocery stores, where the longest part is often tallying up everything in your cart. That’s true of other parts of going to a baseball game, especially this one, where waiting to buy food is just a small part of the experience. There are lines for everything. Lines to get in, lines while you wait for a play to end before you can go to your seat, and the bathroom line Apple Pay will never help out with. Apple Pay also has many miles to go before you can get this kind of experience everywhere. So far its in 220,000 stores in the US, mainly in big chains like McDonalds, Subway, Walgreens, and Apple’s own retail locations. There's also a collection of big retailers like 7-Eleven and Best Buy that are working on a rival mobile payment service, and attempting to shut this one in the meantime. The system still has some oddities, too. For instance, you can’t easily tip people using Apple Pay. Apple’s expecting stores to manage that with typical paper receipts, or checkout software. But for Friday night at least, it was time to forget all that. The stadium is Apple’s and Major League Baseball’s vision of how it wants people to live their lives. Everything, from getting to the ballpark, to getting inside, finding your seat, and ordering a hot dog can be done with your phone — and not your wallet. In fact, the only reason I needed my wallet was to get that beer. But there are still vestiges of the old way that are impossible to escape. Things like paper receipts, the need for an ID card, and those long lines which — even with Apple Pay — are inevitable. And one problem Apple may never be able to solve?

Its revenues grew to $20.84 billion, an increase of 20 percent over the same period last year, but less than what investors were expecting. In its projections for next quarter, Amazon said it expects the red ink to keep spreading, with losses growing to $570 million.   This quarter includes sales, or lack thereof, for Amazon's Fire Phone, which has been widely panned by critics and consumers alike. The company also acquired the video game streaming startup Twitch for $1 billion and said it was investing $2 billion in the Indian ecommerce market. It took out a $2 billion line of credit from Bank of America to finance this aggressive expansion and investment.   There were some good signs for the company as well. Along with an increase in revenue, Amazon saw its free cash flow grow to $1.08 billion, roughly three times what it had in the third quarter of 2013. But overall the news was negative, sending the stock down more than 10 percent in after-hours-trading. Although you can't argue that Amazon didn't warn investors about this. We'll be live on the earnings call and will update the post with any important details. Expect analysts to ask Bezos about the competitive pressures from Chinese ecommerce giant Alibaba, which completed the biggest IPO in history this past quarter. Analysts will also be keen to learn more about the health of Amazon's cloud services business, which has seen growing challenges from Microsoft and Google. Asked what the plan was when hardware projects didn't go as planned (cough, cough, Fire Phone) Amazon executives would offer only the bland statement that they were learning from their successes and failures, and would be very selective about what opportunities they pursue in the future.

The once-popular image sharing service announced today that it has reached an agreement to be acquired by Twitter, saving millions of photos that were set to go up in smoke later today. In a blog post, founder Noah Everett said ""we have reached an agreement with Twitter to give them the Twitpic domain and photo archive, thus keeping the photos and links alive for the time being."" He added, ""Twitter shares our goal of protecting our users and this data."" The service was one of the first and, ultimately, most popular ways to share photos on Twitter. Until more recent years, Twitter itself didn't offer a way to upload and share photos on the social network — users were forced to host images elsewhere before tweeting them. However, once Twitter began to focus on image sharing itself, it rendered Twitpic and competing services largely obsolete. Millions of photos were set to disappear over night Last month, Twitpic announced it had been forced to shut down after Twitter's legal team demanded that the company abandon its trademark application or risk losing access to the social network's API — a service key to keeping Twitpic functioning. Twitpic said it didn't have the finances to fight Twitter in court, and would have to close its doors. Then, two weeks later, the company said it'd been saved thanks to an acquisition, only to announce a month later that the deal had fallen through. Now, with the Twitter acquisition, Twitpic will enter a ""read only"" mode, says Everett. The company's Android and Apple apps have been removed from their respective app stores, and the service will no longer accept new uploads. In closing, Everett writes, ""I want to say thank you for allowing me to be a part of your photo sharing memories for nearly seven years. It has been an honor.""",0.6343656516290866,0.36563434837091335,0.881394651060129,313,4.8530351437699677,197,5.406091370558376,0,0,"Business, Culture, Web",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

Stitcher is already integrated into more than 50 models of cars, including some from Ford, GM, and BMW, and is available through CarPlay and Android Auto.

Revenue has increased compared to $18.53 billion from the same period last year, but net income has decreased 14 percent compared to last year's $5.24 billion. Microsoft's drop in profits is largely related to $1.14 billion of integration and restructuring expenses following the Nokia phone business acquisition. Surface revenue up massively With the launch of the Surface Pro 3 in late June, we’ve finally got a full quarter of Surface revenue that includes Microsoft’s latest tablet. While Surface sales are still a mystery, Surface revenue was $908 million this quarter, up a massive 127 percent from the $400 million this time last year. Last quarter Microsoft’s decision not to ship the Surface Mini hit revenue for Surface overall, but that blip is well behind the company now. If Surface Pro 3 sales continue to be strong, then Surface could easily be Microsoft's next billion dollar business. Microsoft also notes that Surface gross margin was positive this quarter for the first time, but without an exact break down of all the marketing and R&D costs involved, it's hard to say if Surface is profitable just yet. It's heading in the right direction, though.   Elsewhere in hardware, Microsoft sold 2.4 million Xboxes in the quarter, though it once again hasn’t revealed the split between Xbox One and Xbox 360. Microsoft’s Xbox One console has fallen behind Sony’s PlayStation 4 US sales for nine months in a row now.  OEM revenue for Windows decreased by just two percent this quarter, showing that sales of traditional PCs and laptops are close to settling down after years of solid decline. Businesses continue to refresh their PC hardware as Windows XP is no longer supported and Windows 7 moves in as a replacement. Windows 8 adoption in businesses hasn’t been particularly strong, and Microsoft is now focused on Windows 10 which is aimed directly at desktop PC users and businesses. The software maker recently released a Technical Preview of the new operating system, and a final version of Windows 10 should be available by mid 2015. 9.3 million Lumia handset sales, up from last year Microsoft’s mobile efforts might be increasingly moving across platform, but the company still sells Windows Phone licenses and has been focusing on the low-end to push for growth recently. The Lumia 930, 630, and 530 were all launched and made available during the recent quarter, and Microsoft has been increasingly signing new hardware partners in 2014. Microsoft sold 9.3 million Lumia phones in the most recent quarter, a 5.6 percent increase from the record 8.8 million handset sales in the same period last year.   Microsoft’s server and cloud offerings continue to be a vital strength for the company. Revenue has increased 13 percent for server, and commercial cloud revenue grew by a massive 128 percent thanks to Office 365, Azure, and Dynamics CRM. On the consumer side of Office, 7 million people are now subscribed to a mix of Office 365 Home and Personal, up from 5.6 million this time last year. However, Office consumer revenue is down 5 percent overall, showing that Microsoft needs to continue to push even more consumers to its cloud version of Office this year and next. Nadella commits to Xbox once again Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella helped lead an investor call for the company's latest quarter and there weren't many surprises. Nadella once again reaffirmed Microsoft's commitment to Xbox, and noted the company  will strengthen its gaming experiences on PCs and consoles. ""Gaming is the one category that we’ve said we’ll invest in it for its own sake in driving enterprise value,"" explains Nadella. ""The reason we’re why we’re so competitive now in Cortana and speech recognition, which I think is core to productivity, first started with Kinect and Xbox."" Nadella clearly sees Xbox as an important way for the company to analyze and feedback data to improve other products at the company. On the topic of cloud computing, Nadella says everyone should ""think of Azure as the common fabric of all our applications.""

ICYMI: The Verge took Apple Pay for a 'test-drive' on day of its release   Following Apple's announcement last month, both Wal-Mart and Best Buy confirmed to The Wall Street Journal that customers would not be able to use the system in their stores. Earlier this week, a leaked internal memo from Rite Aid revealed that the drug store chain was modifying or disabling its NFC readers, preventing access to Apple Pay (and other systems, like Google Wallet and wireless carrier-backed SoftCard, which also depend on the contact-less technology). A representative later confirmed the news to iMore. Today, CVS followed suit and shut out Apple Pay, according to reports. Both will support CurrentC on launch next year. The companies have not immediately returned requests for comment. Moves by Rite Aid and CVS effectively block Apple Pay in their stores  The fight for control of the mobile payments market is opening a rift between merchants and banks. Banks and credit card companies have enthusiastically supported Apple Pay, seeing it as a way to increase the number of purchases people make with their credit cards. But Apple has struggled to get merchants on board. A quick look at Apple's website explaining the service highlights just 34 retail partners that support the system. Eight of those are different flavors of Foot Locker. One is Apple itself. Retailers are seeking to use mobile payments to cut out credit card companies Meanwhile, not a single bank backs CurrentC. That's because the system is designed to cut out the middleman — and credit card processing fees. The app, when it launches next year, won't replace your plastic credit card. Instead, it will withdraw directly from your checking account when you pay at the cash register with a QR code displayed on your Android or iOS device. Or you can pay with gift cards and ""select store debit and credit cards"" (read: just the ones issued in partnership with CurrentC backers). In exchange for not using your credit card, the retailers plan to offer exclusive coupons and promotions to those who use the app.   The notion of a widespread payment system controlled by retailers and free of credit card processing fees is very appealing to merchants. It should come as no surprise, then, that, in addition to Wal-Mart, the largest retailer in the world, CurrentC's partners include Gap, Old Navy, 7-Eleven, Kohls, Lowes, Dunkin' Donuts, Sam's Club, Sears, Kmart, Bed, Bath & Beyond, Banana Republic, Stop & Shop, and Wendy's — as well nearly all the major US gas station chains — among its ranks. We'll have to wait until next year to see how well CurrentC can compete in the crowded battle for control of mobile payments, but until then, don't be surprised to see more retailers follow Rite Aid and CVS and shut off their NFC readers. Correction: This article originally stated that Apple Pay's 34 official retail partners included five Foot Locker brands. In fact, eight brands owned by Foot Locker are on the list: Foot Locker, Lady Foot Locker, Foot Locker Kids, Footaction, Champs, House of Hoops, Run, and Six:02.

That fishy account has since been quietly removed from Facebook, though it dates back to 2009 and appears to be the work of a former Mall of America intelligence analyst. Before the account was yanked, ""Nikki"" had 817 friends, many of whom The Intercept says had ties to local Minnesota political activism groups. While active, the account also liked the Black Live Matter Facebook group in Minneapolis and changed the top header with a Martin Luther King Jr. quote, presumably to keep up appearances. ""Nikki"" had 817 friends The mall, which gets more than 100,000 shoppers in its doors each day, was the scene for a demonstration last December, where some 3,000 protestors convened as part of the Black Lives Matter movement. That led to the arrest of 11 people, as well as 25 others who are alleged to be involved in its planning. The 11 who were arrested now face misdemeanor charges from the city and prison time thanks to laws that govern what happens on private property. In a response to the report, the Mall of America said it does not track people or groups of people based on their political viewpoints, but that it tracks ""conversations that may pose a security concern."": The safety and security of our guests is the number one priority at Mall of America. To ensure that safety, our security teams use a careful combination of physical means, some of which our guests can see and many of which they cannot see, as well as digital means such as social media. We do not follow individuals or groups based on political viewpoints however we do track conversations that may pose a security concern. These conversations may include unauthorized illegal protests, potential criminal activity or harmful acts on Mall of America property. For obvious reasons, we don’t go into detail about all of those security measures. The goal is, and always will be, to protect Mall guests and create a safe and enjoyable environment for the whole family.

According to The Intercept, German Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel confirmed as much this week, saying, ""They told us they would stop notifying us of plots and other intelligence matters."" The aggressive move didn't apply just to asylum, as Gabriel said that the US didn't want Berlin making any travel arrangements for Snowden to visit under any circumstances. Going against this would result in Germany being ""cut off"" from intelligence that could theoretically help prevent a terrorist attack or shut down other threats to public safety, Gabriel said. Germany faced being cut off from critical intelligence In recent years, the NSA has run a massive operation in Germany — a central hub of its European intelligence efforts — and was also accused of monitoring Chancellor Angela Merkel’s mobile phone. Last July, tensions escalated when Germany ordered the top CIA officer in Berlin to exit the country after arresting a German intelligence agent accused of providing secrets to the US in exchange for cash. Combined with Snowden's disclosures in 2013, the sequence of events has created major friction between the US and Germany. But both countries have vowed to maintain an open line when it comes to battling terrorism — a pact that the US is apparently willing to ignore if Snowden reaches German soil and isn't immediately extradited. Of course, as The Intercept notes, Gabriel's story could also be meant to instill fear in the public, making a clear connection between Snowden and impending danger should he ever be granted asylum.",0.35000957509790637,0.6499904249020936,0.8758566113288163,286,5.2062937062937067,191,5.837696335078534,0,0,US & World,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

""This kind of attack is aggressive and is an exhibition of censorship by brute force."" ""An exhibition of censorship by brute force."" GreatFire's mirroring service serves as a kind of secondary home for sites like Google or The Tibet Post that would otherwise be blocked by China's web censorship systems. That makes it harder to block through conventional means, but it's still vulnerable to brute force attacks at the hosting level. Denial-of-service attacks are notoriously easy to launch, allowing relatively unsophisticated attackers to bring down comparatively large targets. The attack seems to have come in response to a Wall Street Journal article published on Monday, which described FreeWeibo's mirroring system in extensive detail, and may have inadvertently tipped off Chinese censors to potential attack points in FreeWeibo's system. The attacks began Tuesday, the day after the article went live, and have continued for more than 48 hours as of press time. The attack affects all of FreeWeibo's mirror sites, and while there's no evidence of who is responsible, it coincides with stronger enforcement efforts from China's Cyberspace Administration, which has publicly decried FreeWeibo's efforts. FreeWeibo says there have also been efforts to intercept internal emails through impersonation. For the moment, GreatFire's biggest concern is simply staying on the internet. The team is struggling to upgrade equipment and employ other techniques to manage the flood of traffic, and has asked for help from anyone with expertise in the area. Managing the denial-of-service attack has also been expensive, raising traffic to thousands of times its normal level and incurring bandwidth costs up to $30,000 per day from Amazon, the site's provider.

The Commission ultimately accepted a settlement with the search giant, but a confidential FTC report obtained by The Wall Street Journal reveals how deeply divided the Commission was over whether to sue. As part of the settlement, Google agreed to make minor changes to its business practices and argued that the report did not show wrongdoing. But key FTC officials, after collecting nine million documents in the course of the investigation, wanted to take direct legal action against the company. The report reveals why. Google ""adopted a strategy of demoting, or refusing to display, links to certain vertical websites in highly commercial categories."" According to the report, for one example, Google took content from companies like Yelp, TripAdvisor, and Amazon. In the latter case, Google lifted product rankings and placed them in their own search results for those products. When the companies complained to Google about the process, Google threatened to remove them entirely from results. The Journal quotes this section of the report: ""It is clear that Google’s threat was intended to produce, and did produce, the desired effect, which was to coerce Yelp and TripAdvisor into backing down."" The Commission ultimately had Google agree to let websites opt out of the process. The Journal highlights two other concerns from the FTC. For one, Google reportedly restricted websites that published its search results from collaborating with competing search engines. In other cases, Google refused to allow data obtained from its ad campaigns to be used in campaigns with other services. According to the report, Larry Page personally asked this process to continue, before the FTC eventually convinced Google to shut it down. As for search results themselves, according to the report (as quoted in the Journal), Google ""adopted a strategy of demoting, or refusing to display, links to certain vertical websites in highly commercial categories."" Google ultimately made only minor concessions after the FTC's investigation, and as the Commission decided against more forceful action, it was widely seen as a win for the company.

In just over 250,000 of those cases, it censored documents or refused to provide access to them outright — nearly two out of every five requests. Censoring, however, may range from a single phone number's removal to the redaction of nearly an entire page.  The government puts its success rate at 91 percent — still a record low under Obama The Freedom of Information Act is a nearly 50-year-old law that allows any person to request records from the US government, which must turn them over in a timely fashion unless they are subject to a limited set of exceptions. The law plays a critical role in government transparency; unfortunately, this waning responsiveness hurts that, especially as broad conversations about government transparency continue due to a steady stream of leaked documents. The government, for its part, thinks that it isn't doing quite so poorly. The AP reports that the US says it released all or parts of documents in 91 percent of cases, but this discounts some requests and is still a record low under Obama. It's also getting harder to get a response from the government after a request. The AP writes that the government cut around 9 percent of the full-time employees tasked with responding to records requests, bringing the total down to its lowest in five years. That comes as the government's backlog of requests sharply rises. At the end of 2014, there were more than 200,000 outstanding requests, a jump of 55 percent year over year. The government also messed up quite a bit. The AP reports that nearly one out of every three instances that it censored or withheld documents, it was incorrect to do so. However, those mistakes were only rectified after a challenge. That's a big issue for journalists or anyone else trying to see what's happening inside the government. The AP notes that the government has made promises to improve disclosures, but there's no obvious sign of that happening.

With Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice and Suicide Squad both getting time in the spotlight, they pulled out all the stops — and fans seemed more than pleased. Here are some of the most memorable moments.  Director David Ayer took the stage to introduce Suicide Squad, and immediately started taking shots at Marvel. ""I’m not trying to start no East Coast / West Coast feud with Marvel comics, but… DC has the best villains,"" he said. Ayer then went on to play to the crowd with the usual fan service, saying they are the engine that makes everything run. It’s to be expected — Warner Bros. and DC have a lot of hearts and minds out there to win — and they were embracing the darker tone of the DC universe to differentiate themselves from Marvel at every turn. David Ayer on DC v Marvel: ""Not trying to start no east coast, west coast feud with marvel comics."" All about Bad v Evil. After Ayer’s introduction, the cast of Suicide Squad came out — sans Jared Leto. Will Smith, who looked like he’s either a) been working out for months for the role, or b) really into wearing inflatable clothing, gave a quick shout out to the crowd. Fans inside Hall H went crazy, but it’s important to remember: when you’ve spent 24-plus hours in line waiting to get inside an event, you’re really invested in thinking it was all worth your time. Plenty of movies have killed at Comic-Con and then gone on to suffer, but the faithful appeared more than sold on Ayer’s vision. Will Smith and the rest of the cast of #SuicideSquad #DCSDCC #WB #HallH #SDCC pic.twitter.com/8pNz4EcQZb The reaction to Jared Leto’s new take on the Joker has been abysmal. But footage screened during the event seemed to let people forget the gimmicky tattoos, and instead showed off a violent, creepy Clown Prince of Crime. While it will likely be impossible to top Heath Ledger’s take on the character, Leto may be more impressive than that first introductory photo indicated. To find out whether the goodwill extends past the hype bubble of Hall H, however, we’ll have to wait until Warner Bros. dares to show the footage to the world at large. The DC Universe slate was flashed on screen during the presentation, slyly confirming the name of the new Green Lantern movie: Green Lantern Corps. The title has been rumored, with speculation that Warner Bros. was casting multiple actors to play different versions of the character (Chris Pine is one name that’s been floating around). That was the only passing mention, but it gives a clear sign that the film will be focusing on the intergalactic police force, rather than just an individual hero. A new trailer for Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice was shown off during the panel and later released online. It provides a first look at Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman, and also sets up the reason Batman is Mad Batman and not Sad Batman. (People at Wayne Industries were killed in the final battle in Man of Steel.) But it also shows what appears to be Bruce Wayne’s parents being shot and killed. In case you really, really, really weren’t clear about the Batman origin story. Director Zack Snyder and Ben Affleck explained that Gotham City and Metropolis are sister cities in BvS, similar to San Francisco and Oakland. Metropolis is the affluent city, while Gotham is the low-end version, constantly dealing with poverty and crime. Does that make sense with DC canon? Not necessarily… but it does stick with the coastal theme Ayer set up early in the panel.

Quentin Tarantino loves cinema: the idea of it, watching it, talking about it, participating in it. He's the most genuine fan you can imagine, which is part of what makes it so fun to hear him speak about making movies. And that's what a huge part of Tarantino's Comic-Con panel was devoted to, in particular the decision to shoot The Hateful Eight in 70mm — a wide and detailed format that's twice the size of traditional filmstock.  ""If they shoot it in 70, then they'll have to screen it in 70."" Tarantino's decision to use 70mm wasn't entirely aesthetic. For him, it seems to be more about being a part of cinematic history. As more and more of Hollywood moves over to digital, Tarantino is making a point of hanging onto the past. He's aware that he can sound a touch like a curmudgeon — ""That's not the industry that I signed up for,"" he said while discussing digital projection — but so be it. He loves real film. It's all that he wants to shoot. Most directors don't have that luxury, but this is Tarantino we're talking about. If a studio wants him to make a movie, they give him film. And Tarantino doesn't just want his movie shot on film, he also wants to make sure that it's screened on film. That's another reason why he decided on 70mm. ""I thought if they shoot it in 70, then they'll have to screen it in 70,"" he said. Tarantino is even trying to make an event out of the movie's 70mm release. When it comes out on Christmas, it'll be playing exclusively in 70mm for two weeks before theaters will be able to play it any other way. And while Tarantino hasn't said specifically that there'll be any other bonuses for heading out to those screenings, his panel suggested that they could be a lot more elaborate than anyone expects. Samuel L. Jackson recorded a Tarantino-style monologue about roadshows The panel opened with a video of Samuel L. Jackson explaining the concept of a roadshow, describing how certain films used to give audiences a much different experience. There would be an overture, an intermission, and exit music, and you'd get a program telling you about the movie. The movies often had about 10 minutes of extra footage, too. It's not clear if The Hateful Eight will follow all of those conventions, but it certainly sounds like Tarantino wants to give people the chance to have a classic cinematic experience.   And so much about the creation of The Hateful Eight feels like it's about Tarantino reveling in the nostalgia of classic cinema. Not only is he shooting it in 70mm, he's shooting it in Ultra Panavision, a super-wide format that only 10 other films have used — most of which are 1960s classics. It's the same format that was used to shoot Ben Hur, and you can really feel Tarantino's excitement when he says, ""It's not that they used these same types of lenses on Ben Hur. They used these lenses on Ben Hur. They only made one set of them."" ""It's not just for shooting scenery. It's for shooting great drama."" While the decision to use 70mm Ultra Panavision seems to be heavily rooted in these throwbacks, Tarantino doesn't intend to use the format quite like anyone else. The Hateful Eight takes place largely inside of one small building, the super-wide shots allowing you to see distinct frames of action on either side of the main subject. ""I'm looking forward to my movie breaking that notion that 70mm is for travelogues. 'It's to shoot Lawrence of Arabia, desertscapes, and mountainscapes.' No. When you shoot 70mm indoors, it's more intimate. More vivid and vital. It's not just for shooting scenery. It's for shooting great drama."" That said, don't think that Tarantino has stopped thinking about classic westerns. He capped the entire panel off with one final announcement, something that only a film nerd like Tarantino — and those in attendance at Hall H — would flip out about: that Ennio Morricone, the legendary composer who scored classic westerns like The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, is creating the score for The Hateful Eight. It'll be his first western in 40 years, Tarantino pointed out. Toward the close of the panel, Tarantino was asked to elaborate on comments he's made about potentially retiring from filmmaking after 10 movies. He quickly clarified that he's more interested in starting a discussion than setting a hard figure, but one of the things that could make him want to retire is simply not being able to shoot and project on real film anymore. ""The thing I don't like about digital projection is it's just HBO in public,"" Tarantino says. But he adds: ""If that happens everywhere, then I can just move to television."" If that's what Tarantino's retirement looks like, I'm not sure anyone will complain.

Superman trailer. By now, we've all seen the new clip — is it anything you would have stayed up all night for? What about the Twinkies? On the last big day of the convention, we searched everywhere for the most buzz-inducing stories of the moment. As usual, some big franchises triumphed — and others held their weary heads in shame. Pull up the spreadsheet, Batcomputer — it's time to tally the results.  LOSS: Batman vs. Superman had one job at Comic-Con: to drum up mainstream interest in what we all know is a meaningless conflict between two major superheroes destined to be bros. But instead the long, grim, rain-soaked trailer that debuted Saturday made us wish the principals would simply chill and hug it out. As best as we can tell, Batman is ticked off because at the end of Man of Steel, Superman allegedly knocked one of the Wayne Industries buildings down and killed some people inside. But you don't have to be a truther to believe there's likely more to the story. Heat vision can't melt steel beams! While the trailer played to a standing ovation in Hall H, its reception was lukewarm among the non-diehards watching at home. And unfortunately, after the unanimous adoration for Star Wars the day before, lukewarm = a loss, even if we did enjoy Batman setting up quite a selfie — himself brooding on a rooftop, in the rain, pulling a tarp off the Bat-signal so that he could summon ... himself. WIN: Fans were also treated to a first look at Suicide Squad, and the entire cast, including Will Smith and Margot Robbie (and not including Jared Leto) showed up on stage. The early word from the footage is that Leto's performance seems... not terrible? We'll have to wait 'til the trailer makes it to the internet (in audible, non-leaked form) to know for sure, but in a surprising twist, it seems like Squad may be faring better in the public opinion department after Warner's presentation.  I don't understand what I saw in the Warcraft movie presentation #sdcc  Can someone just quickly explain the plot of #Warcraft or...? #SDCC  Writing up the Legendary panel now. As someone who's never even played a minute of ""Warcraft,"" what did that footage do for me? LOSS: There was a lot of buildup for Legendary's presentation for Warcraft, and even non-gamers had their curiosity piqued by the involvement of director Duncan Jones, who has been a cult hero ever since 2009's Moon. But it's clear the film has an uphill battle when it comes to winning over non-Warcraft fans, after the panel left many attendees and journalists scratching their heads. And although fans in Hall H got a first look at some cool, wraparound VR-style footage from the film, it's not hitting the web until November, which made for some irate fans on Twitter.  Superhero selfies and @TheRealStanLee... All sorts of dreams came true in #HallH today. #SDCC #Gambit pic.twitter.com/gRQ14XNPka WIN: After Warner Bros.' mixed bag of a panel, Fox stepped in with some excellent fan service. A spectacularly violent and profane Deadpool trailer drove audience members to chant ""one more time!"" until star Ryan Reynolds ordered his Hall H minions to play it again, making it the first known trailer encore of Comic-Con 2K15. That was followed by a promising new trailer for X-Men: Apocalypse, a cameo by Marvel icon Stan Lee, and a bit where Magic Mike — er, we mean Gambit — himself, Channing Tatum, emerged to take a giant selfie with his fellow superheroes. Fun people, curse words, selfies — Fox knows what the hell it's doing here in San Diego. LOSS: The giant inflatable dog house at Petco Park to promote The Peanuts Movie. Is this the year's foremost fan convention, or is it my eighth birthday party? I don't care if there's a selfie GIF station inside (which there is.)

Google says that the router's circular design should allow it to have better penetration throughout a home (there are 13 antennas inside of it); the router will also automatically detect the best channel to broadcast on and includes support for 802.11ac and 5GHz Wi-Fi. Those features aren't necessarily unique, but OnHub certainly seems like it'll be easier to use for anyone who doesn't care about arcane features like port forwarding. OnHub was built in partnership with TP-LINK. According to Wired, a second router made in partnership with Asus is also in development.  Google is also promising to bring new features to the OnHub over time. It's strange to see any hardware advertised by the fact that it'll get software updates, but that is kind of a change from the existing router market. Though you can expect most home routers to get firmware updates every so often, installing them is usually a pain; OnHub is supposed to handle it all automatically. Right now, it doesn't look like the router has any other surprising software features, but the way Google talks about OnHub makes it seem like there may be some interesting experiments to come. Among the more interesting features that Google brushes over is that OnHub also supports Bluetooth LE and Weave — Google's new smart home language — which could eventually allow OnHub to serve as a smart home hub. In that sense, it's likely that OnHub has more in common with Echo than it lets on: Echo was a simple device that got Amazon into homes, at which point it could expand and start to offer more services. OnHub is likely going to do the same over time, it just isn't clear what its focus will be beyond tying your devices together.

In this installment, we welcome Josh Laincz from the Vox Media editorial products team. I won't forget the moment I realized how much time I spent lost inside my phone. My family and I were on our 13th almost-annual trip to our family mountain house. Set on a picturesque private lake in upstate Pennsylvania, the home-away-from-home is our favorite place to celebrate the Fourth of July. With multiple families packed into a tiny house without some of today's modern amenities, you begin to appreciate the simpler things. A simpler place with fewer obligations The home is situated in a deep valley down a long dirt road. A few minutes after turning off the main road, our phones go into an eternal state of ""searching"" for a signal. The TVs display three or four public channels, whose clarity was recently improved by a makeshift antenna my father-in-law nailed to a tree. In the place of high-speed internet or 500 channels of HD programing, you get a game of late night Scrabble; talking about stories of past trips; canoe trips on the glassy freshwater lake; and kids roasting marshmallows while massive, probably illegal fireworks explode much closer than you'd prefer. I'm always amazed by how the days feel longer at the lake house. I don't know if we enter into some third dimension, or maybe it's the absence of distractions that slows the clock down. Whatever it is, this year the visit forced me to realize how important it was for me to disconnect and appreciate the sound of silence. *** ""Dad, I lost my worm."" Jack, our seven-year-old son, was doing a great job of keeping the fish fed. He was really determined not only to catch a fish, but insisted on learning how to bait his own hook. ""Dad, can I put the worm on?"" he asked. Peace and quiet on the water I'm not much of an outdoorsman, but Jack was really excited about fishing, so I did my best. The next few times, we put the worm on together, and I realized during this process how much of my attention he had, possibly because he was whipping around a razor-sharp hook, but I like to think it was because I was there for him, and I wasn't worried about anything else outside of this moment. Jack felt confident he was ready to add his own worm, after losing 20-or-so from previous attempts. He did great. With the exception of a few poked fingers, he had it down, and finally hooked the first of many fish that weekend. It was a small, pure moment of focus. I've been trying to replicate it ever since.   *** I hadn't realized how much I had been missing in my daily life because of what I call connectivity distraction. I wouldn't say I'm addicted... I work behind a computer all day, so I'm constantly connected. I work remotely from home, so I don't disconnect after my work day ends. Little notifications follow me through dinner and into our evening activities. Even on the weekends, every buzz of my phone, whether I look at the notification or not, I'm whisked away into a state of semi-consciousness where I consider the possibilities of that buzz. Is it an update on a work project? Or maybe somebody replied to a tweet? What if someone is trying to reach me by text? It could be  — and probably is — unimportant. Then again, it could be the most important message of my life! I wouldn't say I'm addicted to being connected, but my norm has certainly become an always-connected state. Since our fishing moment, I've set some disconnecting guidelines for when I am home, and they have been working well so far.   Wrong time, wrong place I enjoy being on my phone, even after work hours. I love what I do, so it's only natural for me to want to read about and poke around in those interests. However, there is a time and place for that. When it's family time, we all go into airplane mode. What I've realized after being fully disconnected for five days, is that the notifications will be there when you're ready to check them.   No such thing as a ""quick reply"" Quickly replying to a work email or Slack ping during movie night is disrupting, and unless it's an emergency (sometimes there will be exceptions), most of the time it can wait. When the lines were blurred between my family and work life, I couldn't disconnect, because work never ended. I now follow a pretty strict guideline, and unless I'm on-call, I don't even carry my phone with me when away from the computer. Or, if I'd like to take photos, I am diligent about using airplane mode.   Think of the children Lastly, I want my children's perception of technology and connectivity to be one of good and value, as a tool, not a lifestyle. My wife and I have spoken a great deal about how important it is for our family to spend time together disconnected, so we've implemented limits for our kids as well. This generation of kids is being raised in a world full of devices and technology at their fingertips, and we want ours to understand not only how to disconnect, but that it's okay and important to do so. In practice, not only am I able to conduct conversation with more clarity than in recent memory, I am more engaged and more clearly recall my conversations when I reflect on the events of a day. By breaking up my day, I've been able to store memories in distinct buckets, which has been really helpful in fostering my work / life balance. It took a few days without technology for me to realize that I need less of it in my life, or at the very least, more deliberate breaks. It was absolutely rejuvenating, and what I realized was it doesn't require a trip to the mountains each time I want to recharge and disconnect, I can do it anytime by just stepping away, because the notifications will be there when I get back.",0.625117800790592,0.374882199209408,0.5007445935619921,1068,4.487827715355805,529,5.9338374291115308,0,2,,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

That means the apples, which will be marketed as Arctic Granny and Arctic Golden, are approved for commercial planting.  Arctic apples will brown over time, just more slowly The apples were developed by Okanagan Specialty Fruits Inc., a small company in Canada. Instead of growing the fruit itself, the company will license its varieties to commercial farms. The company's president Neal Carter told NPR that food service companies will no longer need to treat their pre-sliced apples with preservative chemicals. ""Right now, to make fresh-cut apple slices and put them in the bag, 35 or 40 percent of the cost is the antioxident treatment,"" he said. ""So you could make a fresh-cut apple slice 30 percent cheaper."" Okanagan will sell licenses to commercial farms for a one-time fee of $1,500 per acre of trees. Over time, Arctic apples will age and brown just like any other fruit, but at a slower rate. The apples have been genetically modified to slow down production of polyphenol oxidase, an enzyme responsible for browning. This was done by inserting extra copies of a gene that produces the polyphenol oxidase enzyme into the apple; the apple reacts by shutting down all such genes. During its assessment of the fruit, the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service found Arctic apples posed little to no ""plant pest risk"" to animals or other agriculture. It also determined the farming of the apples posed no significant risk to the environment. It may be years before the apples are available in stores Still, it may be years before Arctic apples are available in grocery stores. Okanagan needs to convince commercial farms to grow the apples and grocery stores to stock them. The USDA said public comments during its assessment were more opposed to genetically modified food in general than with the apples in particular. Some growers are also concerned with the fruit's reception abroad, especially in countries opposed to GMOs. Okanagan is engaged in a voluntary consultation with the FDA regarding the safety of Arctic apples for consumption. Although the FDA currently supports voluntary labeling of GMO foods, it's possible the agency could require Okanagan to disclose its fruits' genetically modified traits to consumers.",0.49876678382271544,0.5012332161772846,0.7833095082587426,396,5.1590909090909092,236,5.8644067796610173,0,0,Science,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The group includes people from all over the world: 39 hail from the Americas, 31 from Europe, 16 from Asia, seven from Africa, and seven from Oceania. Individual profile pages and video diaries show that they vary in background and age, from 20-year-old Bolivian Zaskia, to 60-year-old Pakistani Reginald, each expected to live, work, and die on Mars as part of a tiny outpost on an otherwise dead planet if they're successful in the program.  More than 200,000 people first applied for a place on the project, a privately funded expedition that aims to put a group of colonists on Mars by 2025. That group was first whittled down to 1,058 in December 2013, before being reduced to 660 people by February 2014. The remaining 100 — 50 men and 50 women — now move on to further selection rounds that the Dutch not-for-profit organization says will ""focus on composing teams that can endure all the hardships of a permanent settlement on Mars.""The details of those rounds have yet to be revealed, but Mars One is planning to structure the selection process like a reality TV show, filming the trials and allowing the audience to help with the selection of candidates in the later rounds.

Last year, Wired magazine explained how the visual effects team behind the space blockbuster worked with theoretical physicist Kip Thorne to create a new computer simulation to model how light would be dragged into the black hole Gargantua. Now, the calculations underpinning this code have been published in a scientific journal, with astrophysicists saying the software could help them model other celestial objects in the future. existing software just couldn't handle the size of the IMAX screen When the Interstellar team began working on simulations for the film, they realized that current technology wasn't up to scratch. Their visualizations of stars flickered when scaled up to the 23 million-pixel resolution of an IMAX screen. Instead, they had to create an entirely new simulation model, which they named DNGR — or, the Double Negative Gravitational Renderer. ""To get rid of the flickering and produce realistically smooth pictures for the movie, we changed our code in a manner that has never been done before,"" said Oliver James, chief scientist at special effects team Double Negative, in a press release. Instead of tracing the paths of individual rays of light, say James, he and his team looked at bundles of light, creating a smoother moving image then ever before seen. This proved especially fruitful for visualizing gravitational lensing — an effect where light is bent around massive objects as it travels through space. It's these visualizations that could help astrophysicists model more cosmic oddities in the future. Interestingly, the paper published in the journal Classical and Quantum Gravity also shows that the image of Gargantua that made it into the film wasn't the most scientifically accurate one. In the movie, Gargantua's accretion disc — the glowing ring of matter being pulled around, above, and below the black hole — was created at a relatively early stage, and has a fairly symmetrical design with a red tinge to the light.  The most realistic version of Gargantua. (IOP Science) However, by adding extra detail to their code, the scientists were able to create a more accurate image of Gargantua. The final version takes into account the vast rotational forces that would be created as the black hole spins. Not only do these forces throw matter to one side of the black hole, they also can change the color of the light for the observer. That's the Doppler effect — when a wave changes relative to an observer, because the source is moving. It's most obvious in day-to-day life when a vehicle with a siren drives by, and the sound gets higher as the siren gets closer, then lower as it moves away — but it also affects light.

This is done by recording wavelengths from visible light, which can pass through solid material like paint or skin. Researchers are now working on methods to reassemble scattered light that has passed through opaque barriers to create a useable image on the other side. In 2007, scientists Allard Mosk and Ivo Vellekoop attempted to shine a beam of visible light through a glass slide covered with white paint and focus the beam on the other side. They didn't expect it to work — but it did. ""I really just wanted to try this because it had never been done before,"" Mosk said. Mosk and his team used a ""spatial light modulator"" to control the transmission of different parts of a light beam as it passed through the painted glass slide. A detector on the other side of the slide picked up light transmissions and a computer monitored wavelengths picked up by the detector. They didn't expect it to work — but it did Following two independent studies, researchers have had luck with optical focusing by beaming light through thin material like mouse ears, but some biological tissue — especially tissue that moves and stretches — is more difficult to work with. But the potential to work with biological tissue means visible light images of a person's internal organs could eventually eliminate the need for intrusive surgeries. Visible light images tend to have a higher resolution than images produced by x-rays, because the wavelengths can interact with organic molecules. But it is exactly these interactions that makes visible light difficult to work with. When visible light interacts with organic molecules, its photons can be scattered or absorbed by the material. Absorption will alter the resulting image, making it unusable, but scattering means there is an opportunity for scientists to unscramble the photons. Astronomers have previously solved the problem of scrambling photons using ""adaptive optics,"" a technology that uses an algorithm to calculate how exactly the atmosphere has blurred the imaging of a particular star. The algorithm then eliminates atmospheric distortions using a special ""deformable"" mirror. But human bodies are not internally illuminated the way stars are, so adaptive optics is difficult to apply to internal medicine. Practical applications are a long way off Last year, Sylvain Gigan, a physicist at the Kastler Brossel Laboratory in Paris, managed to reconstruct a hidden image using single-shot imaging. Lihong Wang, a biomedical engineer at Washington University in Saint Louis, managed to reconstruct an image in 5.6 milliseconds, down from Mosk's original hour. For now, the exercise is still a lab study, and practical applications are a long way off. Scientists suggest than in addition to medical treatments, the technology could be used in the military or in art restoration to see underneath layers of paint.

Dogs may have developed the skill during their domestication by humans, according to a study published today in the journal Current Biology. The study also suggests that dogs had memories of what the expressions looked like and were able to associate them with the appropriate emotions. Angry and Happy faces were chosen because they were ""quite relevant for the dogs."" In the study, nine dogs (mainly Border Collies) were shown sections of pictures of sad and happy human faces on touchscreens. One group of dogs was trained to touch the happy face to receive a treat while the other group was trained to touch the angry face. After the training period, the dogs were able to select the correct face with a 70 to 80 percent accuracy, explains lead author Corsin Müller, a cognitive scientist at the University of of Veterinary Medicine in Vienna, adding that the emotions being tested had been selected because they were ""quite relevant for the dogs.""  The set-up of the experiment. (Muller et al, 2005) Similar studies have been carried out in the past, but those experiments tested the dogs by showing them full pictures of neutral and happy faces, Müller told The Verge. This means that the dogs might not have been recognizing expressions, but merely single qualities in the pictures. ""[With the past studies] we're not sure whether they discriminated the face based on human expression,"" says Müller. ""The very simple explanation is the dogs were just identifying teeth."" ""they seemed to realize that the smiley eyes have the same meaning as a smiley mouth."" To exclude this possibility in the new study, the dogs were not only tested on their ability to recognize whole faces but also parts of the face in isolation. If the dogs recognized expressions simply because of the presence or absence of teeth, then they wouldn't be able identify angry or happy faces just from looking at the eyes, explains Müller. Thus, the dogs were trained with just one part of the face and one expression — either happy or angry mouths or faces. Then they were tested to see if they could recognize that same expression in other parts of the faces or whole faces, a task they managed with 70 to 80 percent accuracy. ""They seemed to realize that the smiley eyes have the same meaning as a smiley mouth and angry eyes have the same meaning as an angry mouth,"" Müller says. There were also clues that the dogs were recognizing more than expressions. Dogs that were tasked with identifying angry faces were far slower to learn than dogs identifying happy faces. ""This seems to indicate that they do have some associations [between expressions and emotions],"" says Müller, ""and that an angry face is something they wouldn’t want to approach and touch.""",0.49035851092576854,0.5096414890742315,0.7851613463412807,494,4.8785425101214575,246,5.8495934959349594,0,2,Science,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

A new genetic study out of the University of Michigan finds that penguins appear to have long ago lost the ability to taste sweet and bitter flavors, as well as the savory, meaty flavor known as umami. Together, sweet, bitter, and umami make up three of the five basic tastes. The other two, sour and salty, may still be present in penguins. The findings are being published today in Current Biology.  The fish may have been too cold for penguins to taste So what led to penguins' believed loss of these tastes? ""This is the most difficult question, especially because penguins eat fish and fish have the umami taste, so you would have predicted that the umami taste would have been useful to penguins,"" George Zhang, the paper's corresponding author, tells The Verge. Zhang's hypothesis — and he notes ""it is still a hypothesis"" — is that it's too cold down in Antarctica for these taste receptors to matter. Prior research has shown that the tongue's receptor channels, which are what react to tastes, function poorly at lower temperatures when it comes to detecting sweet, bitter, and umami. The Michigan researchers speculate that the environment may have been so cold that this receptor was ""effectively non-functional"" in penguins' ancestors. ""Those three tastes … would not be useful any more because the channel is not functioning,"" Zhang says. ""So gradually mutations would accumulate in those genes and eventually they would become lost."" The study is based entirely on genetic findings, so another group of researchers will have to actually run tests with penguins to confirm that they can't taste these foods. But the study's authors are quite confident that future work will show penguins can't taste sweet, bitter, and umami flavors based on the genetic findings. ""It's very clear,"" Zhang says. If the genes aren't there, he says, then the animals don't have those tastes. The genes for tasting sweet, bitter, and umami were broken or missing ""The neighboring genes were all there, it's just that those specific taste genes were missing,"" Zhang says. ""So we know it's not because the quality of the genome sequence."" Zhang's research group was able to locate the genes for tasting bitter and umami flavors in around 20 other birds, but in the five penguin genomes that they looked at, including those from Adélie and emperor penguins, the genes were either broken or missing. Birds as a group are known to have lost their ability to detect sweet tastes, so that gene was absent in every sample that was tested. The absence of bitter and umami tasting genes in the five penguins leads the researches to believe that penguins as a group likely lost this taste in their common ancestor, while the ability to detect sweet tastes appears to have been lost much farther back. Because penguins seem to have originated in the Antarctic, the researchers believe that penguins that live elsewhere should also be unable to detect these tastes, too.  (Anton_Ivanov / Shutterstock) Though the researchers believe that penguins should still be able to detect sour and salty tastes, David Yarmolinsky, a taste researcher at Columbia who was not involved with the study, says that's still up in the air. ""Really this paper can only make a statement about those three taste qualities,"" he says. That's because while the absence of a gene typically says something, its presence doesn't always mean the same thing. ""They did find a channel that's necessary for salt taste … but that doesn't mean a whole lot because that channel is required for your kidneys to work,"" he says. ""If they didn't have that, they'd be dead penguins whether or not they can taste. So just because they have it in their genome doesn't mean they have it on their tongue."" Yarmolinsky also says that the gene associated with the ability to detect sour tastes has complications that prevent that tasting ability from being a certainty, too. ""You really have to take the penguin and see how it reacts."" ""You really have to take the penguin and see how it reacts when you give it something sour to eat,"" he says. ""That's really the test to see what they can or cannot taste."" Earlier research suggests that what taste buds penguins do have are fairly limited, if they have them at all. That makes sense, since the main function of penguins' tongues appears to be allowing them to capture prey; penguins also swallow their food whole. ""Given the way their mouths are oriented, and how they hunt, capture, and consume their prey, it’s not surprising that penguins may have limited taste perception,"" Michael Polito, an ecologist with Louisiana State University who was not involved with the study, writes in an email to The Verge. ""Other senses, especially vision and possibly even smell, may be more important when it comes to how penguins find and identify their favorite foods in the ocean."" Whales and dolphins are also believed to have lost most of their taste, with only the salt channel remaining. Yarmolinsky notes that researchers have been looking at taste loss and its consequences in other animals lately. This study, he says, ""really fits into the story that's coming out the last few years that sensor receptors are adaptive to the lifestyles of animal diet."" It's also believed that taste receptors may play other roles inside the body, so a penguin's inability to detect sweet, bitter, and umami flavors could have deeper implications than just what's on its tongue.",0.33417285180020734,0.6658271481997926,0.3484597001327587,957,4.8986415882967611,415,5.9734939759036143,0,2,Science,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

These are just some of the findings reported today in a series of studies published in the Nature journals, which detail a largely unmapped portion of human genetics — and could lead to new treatments for everything from high blood pressure to arthritis and cancer. epigenetic processes that occur in more than 100 cell types  Whether or not a gene is expressed in your body is the product of two layers of biology: the genome and the epigenome. The genome is the collection of genes contained in DNA; these are more or less the same throughout the cells in the body. The epigenome, on the other hand, is the traffic light of genetics; it provides the various signals that control whether or not a gene is active in a type of cell — so it's way more variable. And unlike the genome, the human epigenome has yet to be fully mapped by scientists. The findings announced in Nature today by the Roadmap Epigenomics Program  bring us closer to that goal, however, as they describe epigenetic processes that occur in over 100 different human cell types — and may lead to drugs that can reverse the actions of chemical modifications that regulate genes associated with disease. In the first study, researchers figured out in which type of cell genetic mutations are active for 58 different biological traits. Some of the findings weren’t entirely unexpected. Mutations associated with blood pressure, for instance, are active in the heart. But the researchers were surprised to see that the mutations linked to Alzheimer’s disease are active in immune cells as well as in neurons. If the finding — in mice — holds, that means that genetic mutations linked to Alzheimer's disease affect the immune system as well as neural processes, says Manolis  Kellis, a molecular biologist at MIT and a co-author of the study. Mutations linked to Alzheimer’s disease are active in immune cells instead of neurons The Alzheimer's finding is the product of a mouse study, so it's possible that it doesn’t represent an exact replica of what’s going on in humans with the condition. Still, Kellis thinks that the mouse model of Alzheimer’s that they used — developed by MIT — is a good one, because the researchers were able to show that the genes that are turned on and off in the mouse match very closely those seen in the brain of a human with Alzheimer’s. This is one of the consequences of the epigenome roadmap program, Kellis says; it provides a ""more robust model of the mouse for Alzheimer’s disease,"" which could in turn lead to new drugs that target the immune cells that ""perhaps"" contribute to the predisposition for Alzheimer’s disease. ""There is still a tremendous amount of work to be done — don’t get me wrong, drug development takes many years — but the new directions are promising,"" Kellis says. A second study showed that sometimes one parent's influence outweighs the other on the genetic level. People inherit chromosomes from both parents to make up their double-stranded DNA. But genes from both parents at the same area on the chromosome aren't expressed at the same level. ""One of the parents tends to dominate over the other in the expression of the same gene,"" says Bing Ren, a cellular biologist at the University of California at San Diego and co-author of the study. This finding ""has a profound implication for basic biology and genetic disease,"" because determining which parent dominates for a given gene could one day help us determine a person's risk for developing a disease that runs in their family with a high degree of accuracy.   Cancer cells (Dr. Cecil Fox / Wikimedia Commons)  The researchers also developed a method that can pinpoint the cell of origin of a particular tumor in a cancer that has spread to many different parts of the body. In some forms of metastatic cancer, that location can only be approximated. ""Most of the time those patients are treated empirically, in other words, based on certain features that the oncologist can use to guess what that cancer might be,"" says John Stamatoyannopoulos, a geneticist at the University of Washington and a co-author of the study. ""Typically, the patients have very bad outcomes.""  pinpointing the cell of origin of a particular tumor But looking at what happens in the body in the early stages of cancer through an epigenetic lens might change that. Cancer-associated genetic mutations closely match the epigenetic features of the type of cell that originated the cancer, the researchers found. And that information can be used to determine the source of the cancer with an accuracy of ""close to 90 percent,"" Stamatoyannopoulos says. This could change tumor analysis, as well as change our understanding of cancer mutations in general, Stamatoyannopoulos says — mutations that likely ""hold additional information that we haven’t tapped yet."" The findings described in each of the studies are early, and will need to be validated by other research groups. They should be viewed as a starting point, especially since they didn’t take aging into account. Certain processes in the epigenome change over time, so ""future work should try to address the changing relationship between the epigenome and genome,"" says Henrik Stunnenberg, a molecular biologist at Radboud University, in a Nature news article published alongside the studies. Even with that limitation, ""these papers and the associated data sets provide an unprecedented resource for understanding relationships between cells and tissues, and for delineating how cell-specific programs of gene expression are achieved,"" write Casey Romanoski and Christopher Glass, both molecular biologists at the University of California, San Diego, who didn't participate in the program, in a second news article published in Nature. ""An unprecedented resource."" Now that the studies have been published, Kellis thinks that researchers should try to look at other cell types. ""We have made all these maps freely available as a public resource … to help guide the studies of the epigenome,"" he says. Armed with a more complete map of the epigenome, researchers will be better able to study variation among people. And scientists will also be able to delve deeper into the  relationship between gene activation and disease. ""Just as genetic inheritance predisposes us to disease, the epigenomic variation that we see between individuals can also be associated with disease,"" Kellis says. This means that figuring out how and where chemical alterations act on gene expression could help us determine which drugs work on which individuals and why. ""We expect that this map will be of broad use to the scientific and biomedical communities"" for studies of gene regulation, evolution variation, as well as for studies of human disease, the researchers write in one of the Nature studies. In the meantime, however, these findings serve as an excellent demonstration of how far we'll have to go to really get a handle on human genetics.",0.7757773296529806,0.22422267034701937,0.8357720164339719,1190,5.0462184873949578,499,6.4969939879759515,0,2,"Science, Report",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The scientists at MIT say yes. The university's self-assembly lab has developed a chair that will, when submerged in water, put itself together without the need for direct human interaction. The chair took seven hours to assemble itself The chair is built from six distinct blocks, each with magnets attached. When dropped into the tank, currents in the water gently push the blocks together, making connections that form the shape of the chair. The project is the work of Skylar Tibbits and his team of researchers, and is part of a set of experiments designed to test how materials may one day be able to self-assemble into structures and objects. Athina Papadopoulou, one of the researchers in the team, told Wired that the chair struck a delicate balance between control and chaos. With too much randomness, if the chair's parts weren't designed to find their perfect match, then the final product wouldn't recognizably be a chair. But with too much order, if currents were arranged to force the relevant pieces together, then humans might as well build the chair by hand. As it is, the project is a visual indicator that self-assembly is possible, but you won't be using the lab's chair to sit on any time soon.

Collecting and retaining user data is the norm in modern web businesses, and while it's usually invisible, the result for Ashley Madison has been catastrophic. In hindsight, we can point to data that should have been anonymized or connections that should have been less accessible, but the biggest problem is deeper and more universal. If services want to offer genuine privacy, they have to break away from those practices, interrogating every element of their service as a potential security problem. Ashley Madison didn't do that. The service was engineered and arranged like dozens of other modern web sites — and by following those rules, the company made a breach like this inevitable. The company made a breach like this inevitable The most obvious example of this is Ashley Madison's password reset feature. It works just like dozens of other password resets you've seen: you enter in your email, and if you're in the database, they'll send a link to create a new password. As developer Troy Hunt points out, it also shows you a slightly different message if the email really is in the database. The result is that, if you want to find out if your husband is looking for dates on Ashley Madison, all you have to do is plug in his email and see which page you get. That was true long before the hack, and it was a serious data leak — but because it followed standard web practices, it slipped by mostly unnoticed. It's not the only example: you could make similar points about data retention, SQL databases or a dozen other back-end features. This is how web development usually works. You find features that work on other sites and you copy them, giving developers a codebase to work from and users a head start in figuring out the site. But those features aren't usually built with privacy in mind, which means developers often import security problems at the same time. The password reset feature was fine for services like Amazon or Gmail, where it doesn't matter if you're outed as a user — but for an ostensibly private service like Ashley Madison, it was a disaster waiting to happen. Now that the company's database is on the cusp of being made public, there are other design decisions that may prove even more damaging. Why, for instance, did the site keep users' real names and addresses on file? It's a standard practice, sure, and it certainly makes billing easier — but now that Ashley Madison has been breached, it's hard to think the benefits outweighed the risk. As Johns Hopkins cryptographer Matthew Green pointed out in the wake of the breach, customer data is often a liability rather than an asset. If the service is meant to be private, why not purge all identifiable information from the servers, communicating only through pseudonyms? Customer data is often a liability rather than an asset The worst practice of all was Ashley Madison's ""paid delete"" service, which offered to take down user's private data for $19 — a practice that now looks like extortion in the service of privacy. But even the idea of paying a premium for privacy isn't new within the web more broadly. WHOIS offers a version of the same service: for an extra $8 per year, you can keep your personal information out of the database. The difference, of course, is that Ashley Madison is an entirely different kind of service, and should have been baking privacy in from the very beginning. It's an open question how strong Ashley Madison's privacy needed to be — should it have used Bitcoins instead of credit cards? insisted on Tor? — but the company seems to have ignored those issues entirely. The result was a disaster waiting to happen. There's no obvious technical failure to blame for the breach (according to the company, the attacker was an insider threat), but there was a serious data management problem, and it’s entirely Ashley Madison’s fault. Much of the data that's at risk of leaking should never have been available at all. But while Ashley Madison made a bad, painful error by openly retaining that much data, it’s not the only company that’s making that mistake. We expect modern web companies to collect and retain data on their users, even when they have no reason to. The expectation hits every level, from the way sites are funded to the way they're engineered. It rarely backfires, but when it does, it can be a nightmare for companies and users alike. For Ashley Madison, it may be that the company didn't truly consider privacy until it was too late.

I do it all the time, of course — we all do. Just looking at the stats for The Verge, our mobile traffic is up 70 percent from last year, while desktop traffic is up only 11 percent. That trend isn't going back; phones are just too convenient, beckoning us to waste more and more of our time gazing at their ever-larger screens. But man, the web browsers on phones are terrible. They are an abomination of bad user experience, poor performance, and overall disdain for the open web that kicked off the modern tech revolution. Mobile Safari on my iPhone 6 Plus is a slow, buggy, crashy affair, starved for the phone's paltry 1GB of memory and unable to rotate from portrait to landscape without suffering an emotional crisis. Chrome on my various Android devices feels entirely outclassed at times, a country mouse lost in the big city, waiting to be mugged by the first remnant ad with a redirect loop and something to prove. The overall state of the mobile web is so bad that tech companies have convinced media companies to publish on alternative platforms designed for better performance on phones. Apple doesn't allow anyone else to build a new browser engine for the iPhone, so Facebook's Instant Articles is really just Facebook's attempt to sidestep that restriction by building an entirely new content rendering system — Facebook's major stated motivation for Instant Articles is an attempt to bring down the 8-second average loading time for mobile web pages. You will note that Facebook hasn't built an app for desktops, or tried to roll out Instant Articles for the desktop; the web works just fine when the browsers actually work. Apple News and Facebook Instant Articles are a sad refutation of the open web revolution Similarly, Apple News lets you publish directly onto iPhones, bypassing Apple's own Safari browser, which feels mildly crazy. Yet there's some excitement over this: I just read Ben Thompson's excellent piece explaining how the ad market for smaller publishers leads inexorably to bloated web pages that load poorly. That piece was itself a response to John Gruber saying that Apple's new Safari Content Blocker system would cause a ""reckoning"" for publishers by letting users block performance-degrading Javascript. And yes, most commercial web pages are overstuffed with extremely complex ad tech, but it's a two-sided argument: we should expect browser vendors to look at the state of the web and push their browsers to perform better, just as we should expect web developers to look at browser performance and trim the fat. But right now, the conversation appears to be going in just one direction. And that's troubling. Taken together, Apple News and Facebook Instant Articles are the saddest refutation of the open web revolution possible: they are incompatible proprietary publishing systems entirely under the control of huge corporations, neither of which particularly understands publishing or media. Earlier this year, I called Facebook the new AOL; Instant Articles comes from the same instinct as AOL trying to bring Time Warner's media content into its app just before the web totally kicked its ass. Apple and Facebook are turning their back on the web to build replacements for the web, and with them replacements for HTML and CSS and every bit of web innovation it's taken 20 years of competitive development to achieve. How do you build Fanboys or Snowfall or What is Code using Apple's toolset and Facebook's when they're entirely different? How do you do a better job of integrating video? How do you build interactive news apps? How do you create new types of advertising that address viewer complaints and draw viewer attention if you're beholden to someone else's platform? How do you publish breaking news quickly and update it if your work lives in multiple different walled gardens? How do you innovate in media if you have to spend technical effort just trying to publish? How do you innovate in media if you have to spend technical effort just trying to publish? You might think I'm being hyperbolic, but Facebook launched five Instant Articles with great fanfare on May 13th, published another on June 9th, and just one more last Monday. That's seven articles in two months. The Verge publishes something like 40 a day. It's harder than it looks, and in the end all those engineering hours are being spent trying to display text and video on a screen, just like the web has done for years. The entire point of the web was to democratize and simplify publishing using standards that anyone could build on, and it has been a raging, massively disruptive success for decades now. But the iPhone's depressing combination of dominant mobile web marketshare and shitbox performance means we're all sort of ready to throw that progress away. @reckless mid-2011 here. Even with the measly 2GB of RAM it handles having safari + tweetbot + messages without any issue.  Seriously. The iPhone 6 Plus has single- and multi-core benchmark scores of 1618 and 2900 on the popular Geekbench performance tool, which means it's about as powerful as an 11-inch MacBook Air from 2012. I don't know about you, but given the choice, I would much rather browse the web on a 2012 MacBook Air than my iPhone. The only reason I mostly use my phone is that it's more convenient, most of the time. But otherwise, there's just no contest; Safari on a MacBook is simply better at rendering the web than on an iPhone of roughly equivalent computing power. @reckless With my mid-2011 11"", I find it's decent enough for netbook with both (eight to nine tabs in Chrome before slowdown, I think)  You can go back even farther: I pulled my ancient 2007 MacBook Pro (Geekbench: 1200 / 2100) off the shelf and made no changes save installing the latest version of Chrome onto whatever 2010 mess of OS X 10.6.3 I'd left on it, and overall web page loading times and perceived speed were still faster than my iPhone. You can dive deeply into the differences in processor architecture and the MacBook's 3GB of RAM to the iPhone's 1GB to talk your way around it, but c'mon: this computer came out alongside the first-ever iPhone. It predates The Verge itself by four years. It has a hard drive with smoker's cough and a fan that sounds like it's about to launch into orbit. This is embarrassing. *** Let's look at this problem from a totally different angle. Windows 10 is coming out at the end of the month, and Microsoft is mounting a huge campaign to give it away for free to lots of people running older versions. This is unprecedented for Microsoft, which usually makes money selling new software, but the company's taking the hit in order to rapidly expand the installed base of Windows 10. Why? Because Windows 10 apps run on a variety of devices including phones, and Microsoft is hoping that developers will flock to a big new market for apps on Windows 10 desktops, thus bringing tons of new apps to Windows Phone. This will almost certainly fail. Apps are important on phones because the web experience is dismal What developer is going to spend the time writing a dedicated app for Windows PCs in the faint hope that Microsoft will figure out phones, when they can just write a great web app and cover both Windows and Mac users? What insane person has the courage to install, say, an American Airlines app on their Windows PC? Bad PC software created the opportunity for the web to exist in the first place, just as bad mobile web performance created the market for mobile apps. The first person to fight this truth was Steve Jobs, who tried to push developers toward web apps on the iPhone before opening the platform to native app development; Gruber bluntly called Jobs' strategy ""a shit sandwich.""  Apps have become nearly irrelevant on desktops because the web experience is close to perfect, while apps are vitally important on phones because the web experience is dismal. Windows 10 looks like it's going to be a big step forward for Microsoft, but it won't be able to bridge that gap. I'm not sure anything can. *** Now, I happen to work at a media company, and I happen to run a website that can be bloated and slow. Some of this is our fault: The Verge is ultra-complicated, we have huge images, and we serve ads from our own direct sales and a variety of programmatic networks. Our video player is annoying. (I swear a better one is coming, for real this time.) We could do a lot of things to make our site load faster, and we're doing them. We're also launch partners with Apple News, and will eventually deliver Facebook Instant Articles. We have to do all these things; the reality of the broken mobile web is the reality in which we live. If Apple are throttling back on web platform work in Safari, I wish they'd allow other browsers on iOS so someone else can have a go  But we can't fix the performance of Mobile Safari. Apple totally forbids other companies from developing alternative web rendering engines for the iPhone, so there's no competition for better performance, and no incentive for Apple to invest heavily in Safari development. In many ways, Safari is the new Internet Explorer. Things are mildly more open on Android, but not much — and Google has Mozilla in some sort of hypnotic foundation-grant-and-search-revenue trance anyway, so it's not clear where the competition would come from. That's a recipe for stagnation, and stagnation is what we have. It's leading powerful players like Apple and Facebook to create ersatz copies of the web inside their walled gardens, when what we really need is a more powerful, more robust web.",0.25910926782704635,0.7408907321729536,0.1578880761970106,1672,4.7930622009569381,783,6.0332056194125157,0,0,"Culture, Tech, Web",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The aggressively styled new sports car has been designed in collaboration between Aston Martin and the film's producers. Director Sam Mendes pulled the covers off the DB10 with the promise that ""you will see what it can do when you come and see the movie."" Spectre is the title of James Bond's next appearance on the big screen, and is scheduled for release in November of next year. Aston Martin's press release notes that there will only be 10 DB10s produced, all of them manufactured to a bespoke specification. The company goes on to say that ""the DB10 gives a glimpse to the future design direction for the next generation of Aston Martins."" You'll find more detailed closeups of Bond's new Aston Martin below, along with a history of all the other wild rides that 007 has been seen in over the years.         The original and most iconic of all Bond cars, Aston Martin's DB5 made its debut in the third 007 film, 1964's Goldfinger. It has since reprised the role of Bond's favorite ride several times, including in the latest release, Skyfall. 2006's Casino Royale shows Bond winning the DB5 in a game of high-stakes poker, establishing his credentials as a savvy card player. The DB in the car's name represents the initials of longtime Aston Martin owner David Brown, under whose stewardship the brand rose to prominence. Quantum of Solace may not be remembered among the best Bond movies, but its opening sequence featured one of the most visceral and engaging car chases in the long-running series. Aston Martin's DBS was the unfortunate victim of that violent pursuit. Ben Collins, the stunt driver sitting in for Daniel Craig during the epic Quantum of Solace chase scene, poses in the ravaged DBS. The exhibition includes a selection of motorbikes from the times when 007 didn't have access to a car. Pictured here are bikes from Skyfall, Tomorrow Never Dies, and GoldenEye. The Spy Who Loved Me debuted the iconic amphibious Lotus. Elon Musk spent nearly $1 million to acquire the sub in October 2013.  About as silly as the movie in which it starred, this single-occupancy submarine made an appearance in 1983's Octopussy. Starring in 1987's The Living Daylights with Timothy Dalton, the V8 Volante was ""winterized"" as part of the film's storyline and included a self-destruct button that Bond had to deploy in the course of an escape. Also pictured is the cello case that served as the spy's subsequent mode of transport down a snow-covered mountainside. Bond's gyrocopter in 1967's You Only Live Twice. The Little Nellie was flown by its creator, British airman Ken Wallis, who stood in for Sean Connery's Bond. Blofeld's Bathosub in Diamonds Are Forever is another example of the 20th century's expectation that we'd develop equivalents of the car for travelling via water and air. The man that's set to provide the special effects in Star Wars Episode VII, Chris Corbould, is a Bond film veteran. He has served as FX coordinator, supervisor, or director on multiple 007 projects. If there's one recurring theme to all of Bond's cars, it's the inclusion of violent extras like rockets, machine guns, and tire spikes. Die Another Day was rich on snow and ice, so inevitably there had to be a custom-designed snowmobile for James Bond to ride around on. Another vehicle that featured prominently in a Bond opening scene, the Q Boat took a wild ride through the Thames in 1999's The World Is Not Enough. A 1/3 scale model of a military helicopter that was featured in Skyfall. AgustaWestland's helicopters are built in southwest England, and the company has expressed its pride in supporting the ""quintessentially British"" James Bond franchise. Sometimes, when rapid transport via exotic vehicles isn't strictly necessary, James Bond uses his passport just like the rest of us. Back in 1965, at the time of Thunderball's release, we all thought we would be travelling via personal jet packs in the future. Sean Connery enflamed that fantasy by using one as means of escape in the film's opening sequence.

It'll go over 300 miles between refuelings, which take three minutes — a far cry from the hours that it can take to fully recharge a battery-powered electric vehicle. The h-tron is also a plug-in hybrid, which means you can connect it to charge a battery with roughly 31 miles of range.  It's just a proof of concept — for now California is becoming a popular place to announce hydrogen cars: Honda actually already offers one for lease here, the FCX Clarity, and has announced another (the FCV Concept) for 2016 release. Toyota, meanwhile, is using California as its launchpad for the Mirai sedan. A major reason for that is infrastructure: hydrogen cars require hydrogen stations, which don't exist in sustainable numbers at this point. Toyota is working with California to build out a network there, and has also announced a partnership in the US Northeast to do the same. Globally, though, the cars don't do much good until the stations are widespread. There's no indication that Audi plans to sell the A7 h-tron — it's billed as a technology demonstrator, just as many of Audi's e-tron EVs have been — but the company says it can make hydrogen cars should the stations ever actually exist.

Ferrari, unbelievably, has an answer: the FXX K, which will be shown in public for the first time at Abu Dhabi's Yas Marina circuit next weekend. As the name suggests, the FXX K is a member of Ferrari's XX program, which is pretty unique in the automotive world: basically, the company finds super-rich fanatics of the brand and sells them ridiculous development prototypes that never leave Ferrari's possession. XX cars aren't street legal; when their owners aren't racing them under Ferrari's watchful eye, it maintains them on their behalf. The program began with the Enzo-based FXX, progressed to the 599-based 599XX, and has finally made its way to the LaFerrari. Like the LaFerrari before it, the FXX K is a hybrid, but both the gasoline V12 engine and electric motor have been tweaked for more output. Combined, the two systems put out 1,035 horsepower, up from a mere 949 horsepower in the standard model. Of course, you can't take the FXX K on the streets — you can't even take it away from Ferrari. The FXX K produces nearly 1,200 pounds of downforce at 124 miles per hour, which comes in handy as you're whipping it around some of the most challenging race courses in the world beside your fellow billionaires. But even if you have the money for this car — Ferrari hasn't disclosed pricing — it's almost certainly a lost cause: as with many of Ferrari's most exclusive vehicles, this is a don't-call-us, we'll-call-you situation.

It's mostly the same as the version we were shown at Google I/O in June, apart from some minor refinements. For instance, the green, circular ""a"" logo that appears on the phone when it's jacked into the car now reads ""Android Auto,"" and voice-based searches no longer cause a full-screen ""listening"" window to pop up — you just get a little pulsing ""g"" in the corner. The underlying concept, though, is unchanged: it's Material Design-infused Android for your dashboard, boiled down to the basics with copious use of speech output and voice recognition so that driver distraction is kept to a bare minimum. You're also locked out of using your actual phone when Android Auto is in use, another stab at limiting distraction by keeping eyes off screens and on the road. Using Android Auto is a pretty great experience: it's simple, consistent, familiar (if you're an Android user, at least), and surprisingly responsive. Auto actually keeps up, unlike the tapping and waiting you do with many built-in navigation systems in modern cars. It seems to be only a hair laggier than using your phone directly, which is pretty impressive considering there's not a lot of processing going on in the car; all of the software and horsepower for Android Auto is piped over micro-USB from the phone itself. (The Google product manager demonstrating the system for me noted that the Nexus 5 he was using did get warm over time, but at least it's being kept charged.)  Spotify has an Android Auto app ready for launch. In other words, Android Auto is coming along nicely, and it should be shipping in cars very soon. (Hyundai will only commit to saying that it'll happen at some point during the 2015 model year — but if you buy certain 2015 models right now, you'll be able to upgrade to CarPlay and Android Auto support once they're available.) The problem is that the combined Apple-Google push into the dashboard exposes a patchwork of troubling fiefdoms inside the car's circuitboards. Different functions may or may not be controlled by Auto. For the ones that aren't, you must exit Auto and adapt to an entirely different user interface designed not by Google, but by Hyundai. Want to use Spotify? Android Auto has you covered; Spotify had early access to the SDK and already has an Auto app ready to go. But if you want FM radio, you inexplicably need to select ""Return to Hyundai,"" drop out of Auto altogether, and select it inside Hyundai's far more primitive-looking UI. CarPlay, in many cases, will suffer from the same kinds of arbitrary divisions. There's no rhyme or reason to it apart from the hardware topography. Some functions are actuated by chips in your phone, some by chips in your car. That's an utterly meaningless distinction to the driver.  Hyundai's proprietary interface bears little resemblance to either CarPlay or Android Auto. The most logical endgame is for automakers to publish CarPlay and Android Auto apps that support their vehicles' proprietary functions, so you're able to control everything from a single interface. The car's built-in proprietary system could still exist, serving only as a fallback if the driver doesn't have a smartphone connected. But there's really no sign that we're heading in that direction; none of the Google or Hyundai representatives I spoke with suggested that was a near-term option. Instead, one of the better ideas might come from Volvo, which is using a big, portrait-oriented display to show its own interface alongside Android Auto (or CarPlay). Yes, you do still need to deal with two user interfaces, but at least you can see them at the same time. It's ridiculous to expect car owners — most of whom are not dedicated technology enthusiasts — to use and understand two disparate user interfaces. It's also hard to imagine automakers fully relinquishing control of the user experience to either Apple or Google, but I predict that drivers will come to demand it: it only takes a few minutes of using Android Auto to understand that it has solved in-car navigation and entertainment in a way that car companies never have, and possibly never will on their own. Google currently shows 28 automotive partners on its Android Auto product site; Apple shows 29. One way or another, people will be exposed to these systems over the coming years. As that happens, frustrating, proprietary UIs will finally stop passing muster. Basically, expect to really enjoy using Android Auto. And, at least for now, expect to be disappointed that you can't use it for everything.",0.504384614625406,0.49561538537459404,0.15365541285000803,803,4.8953922789539224,431,6.0324825986078885,0,4,"Google, Tech, Transportation, Essay",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

The series looks to build on its exciting debut  The debut race was exciting even before the race leaders Nicoloas Prost and Nick Heidfeld wrecked in the final corner of the last lap, and more of the same action can be expected this weekend. The street course in Putrajaya features a dozen turns, a handful of sweeping, high-speed curves, and a massive straightaway bisected by a chicane turn that will force the drivers to brake so hard they'll pull nearly 2 Gs.  This weekend also represents the biggest challenges for the series so far. The first race was able to rely on the excitement of the debut — people tuned in to see what it would be like, and the crash at the finish kept Formula E in the news for a few weeks. That translated to decent ratings: over 700,000 viewers tuned in to the ITV broadcast in England alone, about a third of the average for a Formula 1 race. The odd hours for viewers in Western markets makes it harder to watch, but the replay of the race will be this Sunday on FOX at 3PM (depending on local listings). That’s great for exposure, but it also means it’s up against the ratings-juggernaut that is the NFL.

For this car, that's a compliment. The Mirai represents the spearhead of Toyota's substantial bet on hydrogen fuel cell technology becoming commercially viable in the coming years, so if it just feels like a regular car, that's probably for the best. Early on, you've got to convince everyday drivers that a weird new drivetrain can look and drive like any other car on the road without compromise. If this sounds a little familiar, that's because this isn't Toyota's first rodeo: in many ways, the Mirai is hoping to replicate the exact path to success the Prius went down over 15 years ago. What started as a single model, a limited-release novelty, blossomed into a full range of vehicles and a drivetrain concept that found its way into every nook of Toyota's (and Lexus's) lineup. The difference this time around, though, is that the Mirai can't just leverage the existing gasoline infrastructure to get around — it needs an entirely new network of stations. That's no small feat. Matching the Prius' success would be a best-case scenario. It needs an entirely new network of stations The Mirai is launching in the US in the latter part of 2015, but it's coming to Japan in just a few months. I had a chance to drive a Japan-spec version of the car around downtown Los Angeles this week. First, let's just go ahead and get this out of the way: this is not an attractive car. As normally and undramatically as it drives, the Mirai makes no effort to blend in — but neither does it make an effort to be beautifully weird, the way the hybrid BMW i8 does. It's just weird. In the front, gaping triangular grilles rest on either side, sprinkled with chrome and enormous accent lights. The rear looks like an imagined ""future car"" from a ‘90s-vintage sci-fi film, but not in a good way. The sides are the least offensive angle — from here, the Mirai just looks like a smallish mid-size sedan, imbued perhaps with some Prius DNA.    Speaking of the Prius, the Mirai's interior feels like an upscale Prius taken to its logical extreme: it has futuristic accents, a center-mounted instrument cluster, and swoopy dashboard panels that you wouldn't find in one of Toyota's more conservative models. Overall, the furnishings are more luxurious and more solid than anything you'd find on a Prius; there are carbon inserts, a control panel in the rear armrest for managing seat heating, multiple color displays, and power steering wheel adjustment. If you like sitting in a Prius, you'd love sitting in a Mirai. As I said, the car just drives like a car. Acceleration is uninspired — 60 mph comes in around 9 seconds — but it's a serviceable electric sedan that makes no unusual sounds. It's quiet, just as a traditional EV would be. My 15-minute jaunt around LA was a totally drama-free experience. It'll go 300 miles on a tank. But unlike an EV, the Mirai can be ""recharged"" in three to five minutes, Toyota says. That's one of hydrogen's benefits: there's no multi-hour charging process, just a quick stop for a refill the same way you'd get gasoline. The only emission is water. It just drives like a car It seems like an obvious win, but fuel cells can be problematic, which is why they've been in development for decades. They can be finicky in cold weather, and a tank of compressed hydrogen is quite literally a bomb — but developments from Toyota, Honda, and now Audi appear to have ironed out the kinks. (A Toyota representative told me that they've fired bullets at the Mirai's tank without it being punctured.) Still, the Mirai has enormous challenges to overcome. First is the charging infrastructure, which simply doesn't exist at scale right now. (In fact, it barely exists at all.) Ed La Rocque, brand manager for Toyota's fuel cell vehicles, is quick to note the chicken-and-egg nature of the problem — someone just has to pull the trigger. And to Toyota's credit, it's putting money into partnerships in California and the US Northeast that will get a handful of hydrogen stations built by the time the car launches here. By the end of 2016, there should be 48 stations in California, supported in part by a $7.3 million loan from Toyota.   Even with that investment, the car is going to enter the market with limited appeal and limited range. It's not cheap: it'll run $499 per month on a lease or $57,500 to buy, which puts it squarely in a different market than the Prius line. And La Rocque admits it won't be an appropriate car for a road trip, considering the limited station network at launch; in fact, he notes that the Mirai will likely be a second car for most buyers. ""Trailblazers,"" he calls them — people who want to get in on a new technology at any cost. Even ""trailblazers"" might have some design sensibility Of course, even trailblazers might have some design sensibility, and the Mirai's harsh exterior doesn't do many favors there. That's probably just as well; La Rocque says that only a few thousand will be made between the 2015 and 2017 model years. In other words, this isn't the People's Green Car, the way the Prius is. Not yet, at least. When asked if the Mirai could eventually spawn a range of hydrogen vehicles, though — affordable and attractive ones, maybe — La Rocque is unequivocal. ""Absolutely,"" he says. It's just going to take a lot of station-building to make it happen.",0.492018343477475,0.507981656522525,0.1726807798682919,960,4.7000000000000002,509,5.9724950884086443,0,4,"Transportation, Report",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

Many of the country's stores offer disposable bags for you to pack your dripping umbrella into, and now some of its creative types have taken on the task of improving the basic design as well. Hiroshi Kajimoto's H Concept studio has come up with the Unbrella, whose design inverts the standard opening mechanism of the umbrella. The metallic frame is now on the outside when the canopy is open, allowing it to enclose the wet part of your brolly when closed. The Unbrella's design is helpful in gathering all the moisture into one spot, making it easier to commute on those packed Tokyo trains without becoming a nuisance to the people around you. It does pose challenges of its own, however, mostly to do with how much time a collapsed wet umbrella would take to dry out. Still, it's a rather ingenious take on an object that's undergone little change in centuries of history.

Vertu started life in the late 1990s as an indulgence for Nokia's designers. Led by Frank Nuovo, the group set out to explore what a phone could look and feel like if its design was unconstrained by budgetary concerns. What if you could use all the best materials and most expensive manufacturing processes, what sort of phone would you end up with? Given free reign to experiment within the then-resplendent Nokia, Vertu gradually evolved into its own division, with a name, logo, and brand identity that grew to be synonymous with overt demonstrations of wealth. Last year, Vertu gained its independence from Nokia after being purchased by a private equity group and quickly moved to Android as its platform of choice. It is now the most exclusive Android OEM around, offering handsets that cost at least four figures in whatever currency you care to buy them. Still, the way the company conducts its business hasn't really changed from the start. One single manufacturing facility on the outskirts of London handles every Vertu order, with the entire team of designers, engineers, and assemblers all working under the same roof. The central tenet of Vertu design also remains unaltered. ""If you want to stand out, that's what it was built for,"" says Hutch Hutchinson, the company's chief of design, as he points to the $15,000 Signature handset. It's an unapologetic luxury item, one which turns its Nokia Series 40 software and anachronistic number pad into an asset, demonstrating through them that the owner of the phone doesn't need modern technology, he most likely has people doing those jobs for him. And yet, Vertu is also looking to the future with the introduction of two Android phones this year that usher in touchscreens, the Google Play Store, and many other modern smartphone amenities. The company is eager to appeal to women as well as men, and it's extending its range to accommodate a younger customer too. Being a luxury mobile-phone brand presents some unique challenges for Vertu. Whereas the luxury industry ""moves at a very slow and considered pace,"" says the company's head of PR Jon Stanley, the exact opposite is true of smartphone manufacturing. By the time you're fully up to date with both components and software, there's already the next iteration waiting in the wings. Vertu will never actively compete in the specs race, but it recognizes the need to match the basic building blocks of its contemporary competition. Here's a look at what Vertu does with those components once it gets them inside its Church Crookham HQ.  The angular V logo actually came about before the Vertu name. It was originally a softer representation of two outstretched arms of communication — conveying the demonstrative fashion in which chief designer Frank Nuovo expressed himself — but was modified after people realized it looked too similar to the Mazda logo. The V got sharpened up and the word ‘vertu’ was chosen to match it, meaning ‘objects of excellence’ in latin. Vertu’s headquarters is split into two halves: to the right are all the administrative and design teams and to the left you’ll find the manufacturing and shipping facilities. The company’s production line is as transparent as can be — you can literally see workers assembling Signature handsets from the reception area. Aside from the Vertu branding, which is abundant throughout the building, there are plenty of aspirational missives reminding those who work at the company about its unique position and business practices. Everyone inside the production area is outfitted with a lab coat and a set of anti-static heel straps. Vertu claims its cleanroom, where the sapphire glass is bonded to the displays, maintains the same standards for particle contamination as you’d find inside an operating theater. Upstairs are the global procurement and admin staff, while the ground floor is occupied by phone assembly, testing, and packaging. Behind the pallets of boxed handsets is a vault secured by a 10-inch door composed of 15 different materials, which is backed up by a set of steel bars. Inside, an omnidirectional camera keeps a constant watch over the most precious materials that Vertu uses to adorn its phones. There are no conveyor belts at Vertu. One worker is responsible for building each phone from start to finish, and each handset is engraved with his or her signature upon completion. That personal touch is appreciated by the customers, who will occasionally request a particular person to build their next phone, which in turn feeds into the job satisfaction and pride of the people doing the assembly. As a luxury brand, Vertu serves an aspirational clientele and it seeks to reinforce a similar attitude among its workers. If something can be done by hand instead of machine, Vertu opts to do it the human way. There’s a litany of small, custom-made components that go into every Vertu design and they’re all subject to an extremely demanding quality check. Some of the most intricate elements are subject to a 15 percent rejection rate, owing to the precision required and the company’s unwillingness to employ mass production methods. Although Vertu emphasizes the relationship between a phone and its builder, some tasks are done in a serialized fashion. Putting the finer touches on the internal frame of a Vertu Signature. Vertu’s factory feels more like an oversized workshop, with every employee having his own worktable and arsenal of tools. Qualcomm is Vertu’s main chip supplier for the new Constellation handset, whose innards look as tightly packed and integrated as any other smartphone’s. Once a phone is fully assembled, it’s put through a series of machine tests to ensure everything functions correctly, which is then followed by a hands-on check to verify that the phone feels like it should as well. The Par Excellence cabinets, located just to the side of the production area, contain perfect examples of each component and phone that Vertu manufactures. They’re used as reference points to ensure that the company’s maintaining the same level of quality throughout. The smallest screw used by Vertu can almost get lost in the palm of your hand. Carousels filled with screws, antennas, physical key assemblies, and other small parts sit next to each workstation. Training to become a Vertu technician can take anywhere from three months to a year, depending on the level of expertise, but you never have to do the job blind. Step-by-step instructions are provided by a terminal in front of you, which also automatically rotates the component carousel to the part needed to complete its orders. Knowing how to take a Vertu apart comes in handy on the rare occasions that an assembled unit doesn’t pass through the quality checks. A final polish and inspection from a pair of white-gloved hands and your Vertu’s ready to go. The company knows that “the last thing we see is the first thing the customer sees,” so this stage of production is closely scrutinized. A set of five leather-bound Constellation handsets, showing off the various color options and the pervasive V theme, which is extended by the cut of the matching leather cases. The retail value of this one box of phones is somewhere in the region of 25,000 euros. Vertu’s current range, from left to right: the 2008 Signature, which is still the company’s most expensive and exclusive handset; the 2013 Vertu Ti, its first Android handset; and the most recent Constellation, which the company describes as “deliberately more conformist.” Pricing for each starts at 9,000 euro for the Signature, 7,900 euro for the Ti, and 4,900 for the Constellation. Although famed for its ostentatious designs like this snakeskin model in its concept store, Vertu considers them only a peripheral part of its business. Most of its work is done for customers of more restrained tastes who still want a device that “looks like it came from Mars.” Hutch Hutchinson, Vertu’s design chief, says the company is making a conscious effort to appeal to a wider audience with this year’s Constellation and Ti Android phones. While he still believes there’s room for the outrageously sharp lines of the Series 40-powered Signature — for those who want to assert their opulence by merely presenting their phone — he feels Vertu also “needed something that looked like it came from the moon rather than Mars.” Vertu’s sales pitch hinges on three factors: unparalleled customer service and support, handcrafted devices, and exclusive materials. This particular handset is made of genuine alligator skin and zirconium. Renowned British sculptor Richard Wilson put together this futuristic cityscape from discarded Vertu parts. The street lights are made out of antennas, the skyscrapers are built out of metal frames, and the green paths are old bits of motherboard. There’s also an art installation within the landscape that’s made out of display panels that didn’t quite make the cut. Vertu is looking into auctioning off the recycled art piece and giving the proceeds away to charity.

But this quarter, it surprised with a blowout, posting earnings of $8.5 billion on revenue of $42.1 billion, thanks in no small part to its latest iPhones, which broke early sales records. The numbers came in far above Apple's own guidance for the quarter. The company was expecting between $37 to $40 billion in revenue with a gross margin of 37 to 38 percent. Wall Street analysts, on average, were expecting Apple to report earnings on the higher end of that spectrum, at earnings of $1.31 per share on revenue of $39.85 billion, up about 11 percent and 6.3 percent from the same quarter last year, respectively. Only nine days of iPhone 6 sales included here This was a huge quarter for iPhones, with the first nine days of iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus sales tacking onto Apple's numbers, though not the biggest. Apple said it sold 39.2 million phones, up big from the 33.8 million iPhones it sold during the same quarter last year. ""Demand has been staggering,"" Apple CEO Tim Cook told Wall Street analysts on a call following the results, adding that the sales were ""markedly higher"" in every country where it sold the iPhone 5S last year.   Expectations for iPhone sales were running high ahead of Apple's numbers report, in no small part because of statements made by Cook. When trotting out the new iPads last week, he called the new iPhones the ""fastest-selling"" in the product's history, though he didn't offer firm numbers beyond the 10 million the company said it sold during the first weekend the new devices became available. ""The first 30 days, we have set a new high-water mark for the most orders taken. And I don't mean by a little. By a lot, a whole lot,"" Cook said. The bigger question has been how the iPad would fare, and the answer is not well. Apple sold 12.3 million iPads, down from the 13.1 million that were expected, and even more from the 14.1 million the company sold during the same time last year. iPad sales came up short This is typically not a great quarter for the tablet, despite a potential bump from back to school buyers. Consumers have learned to expect a new iPad every year, just like iPhones, and iPods before that. On top of that, iPad sales were down year over year during the last two quarters, and have shown little few signs of growth, short of during Apple's holiday quarter, which is going on right now and brought in record sales last year. Speaking to analysts, Apple's CFO Luca Maestri said the numbers were ""consistent with our expectations"" and that there was actually growth in places like Japan, where iPad sales were up 43 percent from the same time last year. Cook added to that, saying that there was still growth left for the iPad. ""I view it as a speed bump, not a huge issue. That said, we want to grow. We don’t like negative numbers on these things,"" Cook told analysts. ""Over the long arc of time, my own judgement is that iPad has a great future."" Unlike the iPad, the Macs had a landmark quarter, continuing to grow, despite the rest of the industry shrinking. A report from IDC earlier this month showed worldwide PC sales contracting, yet Apple moved into the top five for the first time with a reported 8.9 percent growth, year over year. Apple's numbers verified that, with the company reporting sales of 5.52 million Macs, way up from the 4.85 million that were expected, and setting a new all-time record during a quarter. Much of that growth came from emerging markets, Maestri told analysts.  The iPod is no longer its own product category Still in freefall were iPods. Apple sold 2.6 million iPods, down 24 percent from the 3.5 million the company sold during the same time last year. That shouldn't be too much of a surprise though, given that Apple hasn't really updated its iPods since the end of 2012. Speaking to analysts today, Apple noted that the iPod was no longer its own product category. Instead, it will be lumped in with sales of the Apple Watch when it goes on sale, along with the Apple TV and Beats accessories. ""We looked at current revenue and decided that we would lump everything that wasn't a Mac, or an iPad, or an iPhone, or a service in one kind of category,"" Cook told analysts. ""In the future, we might decide something different."" Looking ahead, Wall Street analysts, polled by Yahoo, expect Apple to report earnings of $2.40 per share on revenue of $65.52 billion. That would be the company's highest revenue ever, fueled by sales of the new iPhones and iPads. In its own forecast, Apple said it expects revenue to fall somewhere in the middle of that, between $63.5 and $66.5 billion, with a gross margin between 37.5 and 38.5 percent. It's been a very busy time for Apple It's been an extremely busy month and a half in the lead up to Apple reporting its numbers. The company announced and shipped the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, previewed the Apple Watch, and just last week debuted new iPads and Mac desktops. But short of the iPhone, sales of those new products have no impact on this quarter, which ended September 27th. It's the same story with the Apple Pay platform, which was demoed alongside the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus last month, but didn't go live until today. Apple's getting a cut from each transaction people are making when buying things from merchants, adding yet another revenue stream and one that could help it in the quarters when not as many people are buying phones and tablets. Not one to shy away from promising that more good things are on the way, Cook said there are still things to look forward in the company's 2015 pipeline, but that the company's been pretty busy lately. ""We’ve already announced two new categories in the past 90 days,"" Cook fired back at an analyst question about what was next. ""To the degree I can keep it in the cone of silence, I will.""

Though little is known about what Magic Leap is working on, Google is placing a big bet on it: in addition to the funding, Android and Chrome leader Sundar Pichai will join Magic Leap's board, as will Google's corporate development vice-president Don Harrison. The funding is also coming directly from Google itself — not from an investment arm like Google Ventures — all suggesting this is a strategic move to align the two companies and eventually partner when the tech is more mature down the road.  ""You’re in the room, and there’s a dragon flying around, it’s jaw-dropping."" Magic Leap's technology currently takes the shape of something like a pair of glasses, according to The Wall Street Journal. Rather than displaying images on the glasses or projecting them out into the world, Magic Leap's glasses reportedly project their image right onto their wearer's eyes — and apparently to some stunning effects. ""It was incredibly natural and almost jarring — you’re in the room, and there’s a dragon flying around, it’s jaw-dropping and I couldn’t get the smile off of my face,"" Thomas Tull, CEO of Legendary Pictures, tells the Journal. Legendary also took part in this round of investment, alongside Qualcomm, Kleiner Perkins, Andreessen Horowitz, and Obvious Ventures, among others. Qualcomm's executive chairman, Paul Jacobs, is also joining Magic Leap's board. The eclectic mix of companies participating in this investment round speak to how broadly Magic Leap sees its potential. Its founder says that he wants the company to become ""a creative hub for gamers, game designers, writers, coders, musicians, filmmakers, and artists."" Legendary, which makes films including Godzilla and The Dark Knight, is interested in its potential for movies. Google likely sees far more ways to put it to use. The technology sounds like it could be an obvious companion to Google Glass, but for now the Journal reports that they're not being integrated. Magic Leap declined to commented on what might happen down the road. Nonetheless, the investment in Magic Leap appears to be Google betting on augmented reality as the future of computing, pitting it in a fight against virtual reality competitors. Eventually, it'll likely be facing off against Facebook's Oculus Rift — the biggest name in VR right now, and one that Facebook was willing to pay $2 billion for.  Magic Leap also says that it may ""positively transform the process of education."" Magic Leap is run and was founded by Rony Abovitz, who previously founded the medical robotics company Mako Surgical, which was sold for $1.65 billion last year. The Journal reports that Abovitz has a biomedical engineering degree from the University of Miami. He previously made a bizarre, psychedelic TEDx talk involving 2001, green and purple apes, and a punk band. His new company, which has been around since 2011, is headquartered in Florida, so it isn't exactly the typical tech startup out out of Silicon Valley. Aboitz says the location allows Magic Leap to recruit globally. It currently has over 100 employees. ""When you see this, you will see that this is computing for the next 30 or 40 years."" Though Magic Leap's product sounds like a pair of augmented reality glasses, Abovitz and his company dislike the term. Magic Leap brands its effect as ""Cinematic Reality,"" which sounds a bit cooler but doesn't really mean anything just yet. ""Those are old terms – virtual reality, augmented reality. They have legacy behind them,"" Abovitz told the South Florida Business Journal back in February, after closing an initial round of funding. ""They are associated with things that didn’t necessarily deliver on a promise or live up to expectations. We have the term cinematic reality because we are disassociated with those things. … When you see this, you will see that this is computing for the next 30 or 40 years. To go farther and deeper than we’re going, you would be changing what it means to be human."" This is all something that Google is eager to view the results of. ""We are looking forward to Magic Leap's next stage of growth, and to seeing how it will shape the future of visual computing,"" Pichai says in a statement. What exactly Google will do with augmented reality is still unknown, but, much like how Google has managed to control a great deal of mobile computing through Android, it's been looking ahead to ensure that it doesn't miss out on the next leap either. It declined to provide further comment on the investment. Talking to TechCrunch, Abovitz says that Magic Leap should be launching a product for consumers ""relatively soon.""

According to The Wall Street Journal, the plan takes advantage of the fact that CVS also owns Caremark, one of the United States' largest pharmacy benefits managers — which are intermediaries between insurance companies and pharmacies. CVS' reported plan is to have Caremark begin raising certain customers' copays by up to $15 when they fill a prescription at a pharmacy that sells tobacco products.  Other pharmacies won't be happy about this The result would be twofold: other pharmacies may begin feeling pressure to cut off tobacco sales, and CVS would become a more appealing place to fill prescriptions. When CVS originally announced its plan to end tobacco sales, it said that it wanted to focus more on health-related services, and this would play right into that. CVS may find itself making more money filling prescriptions, as customers head there to save money — or, worryingly for smaller pharmacies, head to CVS because they aren't sure if they'll be charged the additional fee elsewhere. CVS did not respond to a request for comment on the plan, though the Journal makes it sound like it received some degree of confirmation on the upcoming policy. It's not stated exactly who would receive the surcharge or when it would go into effect. The policy does seem to play into CVS' stated goal of promoting good health. CVS points the Journal to a study it ran that found that banning tobacco sales in pharmacies reduced the total number of people buying tobacco products by 13.3 percent in Boston and San Francisco, which implemented citywide bans toward the end of the 2000s. That said, CVS is using its ownership of a related business to disadvantage its competitors, which there's little doubt other pharmacies will be unhappy with. The merged company has occasionally been the subject of antitrust concerns, though not to any substantial results.

For the past few months, they've been searching anonymous posting sites like Pastebin for leaked passwords and proactively trying out the passwords on Facebook accounts. If they get a hit, the user is notified and their password is automatically reset. The hope is, if a working Facebook password finds its way onto the dark web, Facebook will find it before any criminals do. The core of the problem is still password recycling, which (just to be clear) is still a very bad, no-good idea. ""If you use the same password on lots of websites, an attacker only has to get your password once to be able to access all of those accounts,"" Facebook security engineer Chris Long said in a public post announcing the project. But as long as users keep doing it, Facebook will find a way to try to protect them. It's a sign of how the security world has shifted in recent years. What used to be a public catastrophe is now easily protected against by ecosystem-level protections.

It seemed odd to me that big-name financial institutions would be falling all over themselves to promote a service which hasn't yet launched and isn't exclusive to them. But there are actually three very good reasons for the big players in banking and credit to be shoving their way to the front of the line on your Apple Pay. First off, banks are keen to have their customers use a digital wallet over a credit card because it could save them money. They don't have to print you up a fancy piece of plastic every couple years, more often if you lose it or it's stolen. Speaking of stolen, many banks believe a digital wallet with Touch ID and secure digital elements will greatly reduce the fraud and theft currently afflicting our credit card system. But saving money is not the principle reason banks are competing for that primary slot. Secondly, Apple has a history of succeeding where others have failed. The banks know that hundreds of millions of people already use an iPhone. They are betting it can go mainstream where Google Wallet and PayPal have so far remained niche. That belief is based on the last decade, in which Apple took products — MP3 players, smartphones, tablet computers — and made them into a huge commercial success where others had tried and failed. Banks are declaring it the game changer. @benpopper We believe Apple Pay has the potential to be a game changer. Check out Gavin Michael on @CNBC: http://t.co/4PDbEn8GvB. ^JS  There is no guarantee Apple Pay will take off, but if it does, banks and credit cards are desperate to be the first ones you load. That brings us to our third and most important point: Apple Pay will work with multiple credit, debit, and reward cards if you load them into Passbook. But as our hands-on video demonstrated, most of the time people will probably be relying on the default card, avoiding the hassle of unlocking the phone and tapping around in Passbook. @benpopper It's a land grab to be the default card in everyone's ApplePay wallet. I am getting emails from all my banks: Chase, WF, Citibank  It helps to think of this competitive dynamic in terms of the mobile apps you currently use. We used to talk about the battle for the home screen: being one of the first apps you see when you unlock your phone. The arms race has since accelerated, pushing the battleground to the lock screen, which you can often see without touching a single button. Think of Apple Pay with Touch ID as the pre-screen. You're holding your phone, you buy something, you put your phone up to the register with your finger on Touch ID, and boom, you've paid. No swipes, taps, or anything else required. It's no wonder banks are competing zealously for prime real estate on what should be a core function of the modern smartphone.",0.5381994221151272,0.46180057788487283,0.21111338824412387,534,4.6423220973782771,306,5.6013071895424833,1,0,"Apple, Business, Tech",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

Recode reports that the service will begin in Park Slope, a generally well-off neighborhood associated with city parents, and that Amazon intends to expand to elsewhere in Brooklyn from there. Amazon doesn't say whether it'll be launching in Manhattan, but same-day grocery delivery has long been a field that web companies have tried to crack — and should its experiments in Brooklyn succeed, there's no doubt that Amazon will keep pushing forward.  $299 per year to get groceries to your door Amazon Fresh is already up and running in Seattle, Los Angeles, and San Francisco.

As he traveled the world last year as part of a user research project, Michael Ducker noticed a problem. Ducker, a senior product manager at Twitter, was part of a team that visited Brazil, India, and Indonesia to learn about how people use mobile devices around the world. Twitter is courting new users aggressively, and like most tech companies it signs them up with a combination of an email address and password. The problems with passwords are well known: they can be hard for us to keep track of, easy for hackers to figure out, and never anything but tedious to type out on your mobile device’s tiny keyboard. But in his travels, Ducker and his team began to understand the other half of the problem in signing up new users: the farther he traveled from America, the less likely it was that anyone he met had an email address. In developing countries, people are more likely to identify themselves via their mobile devices. Instead of email addresses, they have cell phones — and no way to easily sign up for Twitter or other services. But that’s all about to change: if Twitter has its way — and developers decide they can trust it again — phone numbers will become the primary way we log into our mobile applications, and we’ll all have fewer passwords to remember. The further you travel from America, the less likely anyone is to have an email address Today at Flight, its first developer conference in four years, Twitter is unveiling a suite of developer tools aimed at re-making mobile applications. And while many of the details are of interest only to developers, Twitter is positioning the tool set — called Fabric — as a new start. ""Fabric is actually the next evolution of Twitter itself,"" says Kevin Weil, vice president of product for revenue at the company. ""After Fabric, as the platform grows, you won’t think about Twitter as just the consumer app. You’ll think about Twitter as a broader mobile services company. So Fabric is a really big step in that direction for us.""   For most people, the most visible part of the new Twitter will be Digits, the company’s password replacement effort. Starting soon, developers will be able to use Digits to sign up users to their apps. The process has three steps: a login screen with an option to sign up via mobile device; a screen to enter your phone number, and a screen to enter the confirmation code Twitter sends you via SMS. (The process will look familiar to anyone who has signed up for WhatsApp or, more recently, Yo.) The confirmation code expires after you use it once, so the next time you need to log in to the app, you’ll be sent a fresh code. Like Vine, Twitter’s video-sharing app, Digits will operate as a brand unto itself. It has a home at Digits.com, where you can manage other apps’ access to your phone number, or delete your account. For developers, it’s a more secure way to bring on users around the world. And for Twitter, it’s a way to help eliminate passwords. Most people use the same passwords repeatedly, and use passwords that are relatively easy to guess. And many buzzy new apps aren’t backed by strong security practices. Twitter says it is bringing everything it has learned about security since its founding to Digits. ""Passwords just suck,"" Ducker says. ""I go to dinner parties and people say, 'Oh, you work in tech? Can you get rid of the password?' And we’re finally getting rid of the password, for the vast majority of use cases.""   Phone numbers aren’t perfectly secure; it is possible, though not easy, to clone a phone number. But for most people, logging in with a phone number is probably more secure than using an email address and a password. And because the login codes created through Digits expire after a single use, there’s less danger in hackers obtaining a cache of login information and using it maliciously, as seems to happen every other week. Eventually, Digits will support two-factor authentication for apps, sending users a secondary PIN code to use in combination with the expiring codes. A way to diversify Twitter Much of Twitter Fabric was first reported last month by The Information. But contrary to that report, registering a number with Digits does not create a ""shadow"" Twitter account. Twitter says there is almost no connection between Fabric and the consumer app whatsoever. Fabric is not primarily a way to attract more users to Twitter, they say — it’s a way to diversify Twitter, growing its nascent business of selling tools to mobile developers from a company that was born on cellphones. (It’s not the only social network to have this idea; Facebook started doing something similar last year after acquiring the developer service Parse.) In addition to Digits, Twitter will also announce new features for MoPub, Twitter’s lucrative advertising platform, and Crashlytics, which offers developers free services for beta testing and crash reporting. Crashlytics will offer a native development kit for Android, let developers troubleshoot problems at the system level; and a tool for distributing beta versions of software to testers via an emailed link. And Digits is part of a larger module called TwitterKit, a new set of APIs for Twitter that, among other features, enables the same system-level sign on for Android that Twitter already has on iOS. Log in to your Android device with Twitter and you’ll be able to sign into any other app that has enabled Twitter logins. Twitter still pays for all those SMS messages Everything Twitter is announcing today will be free to developers, raising the question of how the company benefits. (The company will pay carriers for every SMS it sends through Digits.) The basic idea is that if a critical mass of developers adopts Twitter’s tools, the company will eventually be able to sell them services to complement the free ones. ""If you do that, you’re providing a very powerful platform for developers, and there’s lot of benefits that come down the road from that,"" Weil says. First, though, Twitter has to convince developers to embrace it. The company’s relationships with the developers who build on its platform has been strained since 2012, when it unveiled new ""rules of the road"" whose primary effect has been to discourage the development of third-party Twitter clients. A handful remain, but they seem perpetually at risk of disappearing. The developer Marco Arment, writing this week, said he would never trust Twitter again: ""We’re just innocent bystanders getting hit whenever this fundamentally insecure, jealous, unstable company changes direction, which happens every few years,"" wrote Arment, who most recently developed Overcast, an app for listening to podcasts. ""Twitter will never, and should never, have any credibility with developers again."" ""Our API was so open that we allowed people to compete with us."" Twitter, for its part, says what happened in 2012 has little bearing on its platform strategy today. ""The two situations are completely different — so different, in fact, that it doesn’t even really make sense to conflate them, honestly,"" Weil says. He named a few companies that have made millions of dollars developing on Twitter’s platform, including TweetDeck, Hootsuite, and the social-media monitoring company Radian6, which sold to Salesforce for $340 million. The changes in 2012 were intended only to ensure Twitter had control over its core service, he says. ""Our API was so open that we allowed people to compete with us, and so there were changes we had to make."" If the old Twitter-developer relationship was about working in tandem to develop a new kind of media company; the new relationship is more about using what Twitter has learned since then to help developers do just about anything else. Today, more than 800 developers are expected at the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium in San Francisco to hear about what Twitter has to say to them. But it may be even more interesting to hear what those developers have to say back to Twitter.",0.6429006270568745,0.35709937294312555,0.8357052045966813,1364,4.9516129032258061,633,6.2132701421800949,0,4,"Business, Mobile, Tech, Report",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

Normally the world goes crazy when Apple debuts a device, but the reaction to these iPads was decidedly muted. They were thinner and had more horsepower, sharper screens, better cameras, and Touch ID. But they didn't generate anywhere near the excitement of the iPhone 6 last month, or of previous generations of iPad. All that points to an increasingly clear trend: tablet computers may be here to stay, but they are not going to replace the laptop or PC the way many people once thought they would — at least, not without a drastic shift in philosophy and marketing. iPad sales are down 13 percent from 2013 In its earnings report today, Apple said that it sold a little over 12.3 million tablets over the last three months, a decline of 13 percent compared to the same period in 2013. That's a sobering reality for the company, whose tablet sales declined 16 percent year over year last quarter. And it compares to an increase of 25 percent for Macs and 12 percent for iPhones. The iPad is now a product category in decline, much like the iPod. Why is this happening? One big reason is size. Anonymous Apple blogger Sammy the Walrus IV put it very nicely: The form factor is key here, not just in terms of the utility for the consumer, but developer support. For all the talk of Apple not suffering from the fragmentation of Android, many well-known iOS apps don't offer an iPad version. As Ben Thompson wrote over at Stratechery: The new iPads — which aren't yet released — obviously aren't reflected in today's earnings, but it seems unlikely that they will fundamentally alter the headwinds facing the device. Apple still makes profit on every iPad, and there's little doubt that the product category is here to stay — but new questions are brewing about how iPads fit in a world dominated by giant iPhones and small MacBooks that are running a new, thoroughly redesigned version of OS X.",0.3721498795819609,0.6278501204180391,0.20248917548930426,364,4.6565934065934069,227,5.4713656387665202,0,0,"Apple, Business, Tech",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

Wheeler spoke before the House oversight committee this morning, frequently calling out the lengths that the FCC went to in seeking public input on its Open Internet rules. But mostly, Wheeler just addressed Republican accusations that he bent to behind-the-scenes White House pressure.  ""There were no secret instructions from the White House."" ""Here I would like to be clear. There were no secret instructions from the White House,"" Wheeler said. ""I did not, as CEO of an independent agency, feel obligated to follow the president’s recommendation."" Wheeler pointed out, as he's been doing over the past few weeks, that nearly 4 million people gave feedback on the original net neutrality proposal, all of which is meant to be fed into the final rules. There's been a very prominent push for Title II regulation, so Wheeler has plenty of backing to point to when trying to convince opponents that Obama isn't the only one pushing for it. And, seriously, he did that a lot. ""You have asked whether there were secret instructions from the White House,"" Wheeler said. ""Again, I repeat the answer is no."" That said, Wheeler admits that Obama's support for Title II did have some impact. But that impact, he says, was in giving the issue ""new prominence"" and getting Republicans to start considering net neutrality legislation. He also says that Obama's announcement allowed the commission to examine market reactions to the possibility of Title II without rate regulations — as the commission is implementing. According to Wheeler, there was no change in the markets. Representative Jason Chaffetz (R-UT), chair of the committee, focused his questioning on the possibility of White House influence. He asked Wheeler why he agreed to meet with the White House but wouldn't meet with Congress. The questioning did not go well. A loose transcription: Chaffetz: You met with them multiple times ... We invite you to come, and you refuse. We ask you to send us some documents, you didn't send us a single one. That double standard is very troubling for us. I need to move on. Wheeler: I did agree to come. I'm here. C: Before the rule. You met with the White House, but you didn't come here. W: You gave me a week's notice. C: That's usually what we give people. W: Mr. Chairman, there are other committees I'm trying to respond to. I said I looked forward to coming here. C: I didn't believe you then, and I don't believe you now. You said that you would not come to visit with us. You didn't send us a single document we asked for. W: I think we sent you 1,800 documents. C: After the rule. W: Challenge. C: I'm moving on. Chaffetz also presented Wheeler with a previously redacted email that he sent remarking on how protestors were outside his house the same day that Obama announced his support of Title II. ""The day of the demonstration just happens to be the day folks take action at my house,"" Wheeler writes. His email ends, ""Hmmm..."" House Oversight releases this email by @TomWheelerFCC (previously redacted) pic.twitter.com/3xvTnsGWtf  In his line of questioning, Chaffetz asked Wheeler whether this implied that the FCC was coordinating with the White House. Wheeler appeared, perhaps, embarrassed, as the email actually seems to be him implying that the White House coordinated with protestors to bother him. ""This clearly is a showing that there was no kind of coordination,"" Wheeler said, referring to a relationship between the FCC and the White House. Questioners asked when the FCC started looking into Title II Representative Jim Jordan (R-OH), in an aggressive line of questioning that didn't often give Wheeler a chance to speak, focused on how the commission appeared to have only decided on Title II after Obama's statement. Jordan pointed out that, prior to Obama's support, the commission appeared to be leaning toward using Section 706. Wheeler argued that this is not entirely correct. The original proposal, he says, specifically inquired about the use of Title II. He also brought up a New York Times report saying that there were four options under consideration as of about two weeks before Obama's statement. Though the Times' report focuses on the hybrid Section 706 / Title II approach, it does mention that sole Title II and dual Title II and 706 were under investigation as well. Though we've heard all of these questions time and again, Wheeler's ability to answer them is important. As an independent agency, its net neutrality rules should come from its leaders with influence from public comments — not based largely on the whims of the White House. And signs of White House influence could make things harder for the commission when it inevitably has to defend these rules in court. While the commission generally has the ability to make these changes based on its own interpretation of legal statutes, it might lose that ability if a court believes that it didn't actually come to that interpretation on its own. Wheeler is going to be answering these questions ad nauseam, and that's a big part of the reason why. If you've enjoyed this installment of Wheeler Heads to Congress, you can look forward to more very soon. Hearings with him and the other commissioners follow on both Wednesday and Thursday, both of which are likely to have a heavy focuses on net neutrality. Politico reports that Wheeler will then have two more House committee meetings next week, both with Republican commissioner — and opponent of these rules — Ajit Pai.",0.47700802045742824,0.5229919795425717,0.8271980050330656,969,4.9071207430340555,470,6.0127659574468089,0,0,"Policy & Law, US & World",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

As if six thousand people were suddenly silenced by a free concert.' Friday belonged to Star Wars so hard that in a just world this post would be scrolling up your screen as a title crawl. It would blare John Williams' score from your speakers and punctuate every sentence with a Kylo Ren emoji. But since we're in a hurry, the best we can tell you in plain text is this: Comic-Con remains an ever-shifting game of winners and losers, and even the proudest of brands can find themselves felled by activation gone awry. Once again today, we stalked Hall H on your behalf, sidled up to lesser panels, and absorbed hundreds of tweets, Instagrams, and articles from the various corners of the Con we couldn't make it to in person. Here then are the day's proudest moments in all of fandom — along with the moments that should have been shelved along with all three Star Wars prequels.    WIN: Lovingly shot behind-the-scenes footage of The Force Awakens. An onstage reunion for Luke, Leia, and Han Solo. And just when you went to complain that we still don't know anything about the plot, and that it could be another movie about the damn trade routes on Naboo, here comes J.J. Abrams to invite us all to a free concert with the San Diego Symphony playing the music of Star Wars. Few sights at Comic-Con have ever been so dramatic Few sights at Comic-Con have ever been so dramatic as 6,000 people flooding out of Hall H to take their place at the concert, where they were given free light sabers to wave as the cast joined the orchestra on stage. It was an admirable gesture of goodwill to people who had slept in line overnight for a chance just to see the panel, and the resulting flood of social media posts was an earned media bonanza. As fireworks rang out over the stage, not even the most churlish Comic-Con attendee could complain.  I feel a grave disturbance in the Force. As if six thousand people were suddenly silenced by a free concert. Might have to cancel my panel. LOSS: The person most negatively affected by the sudden rapture of Star Wars fans from Hall H was likely film director Kevin Smith, who was scheduled to take the podium immediately afterward to flog his new comedy horror movie, Yoga Hosers. Faced with a choice of listening to John Williams under the starlight or watch Smith in the role of a Bratzi — ""a foot-tall Canadian Nazi made of sentient Bratwurst"" — 100 percent of people made the right choice and left the hall.  Hall h right now after JJ invites everyone to a live STAR WARS concert. Kevin Smith is up next. A video posted by Steve Weintraub (@colliderfrosty) on Jul 10, 2015 at 7:04pm PDT WIN: We are somehow through five seasons of AMC's The Walking Dead, and the trailer shown at Comic-Con today indicates season six will tackle the increasingly hot topic of community moderation. As Rick tries to take control of Alexandria (a website) and keep it safe from walkers (trolls), our sheriff learns the hard way about the growing risk of community revolt. Will Rick shoot everyone in Alexandria with a gun? Or will he simply close the comments? For the bold and controversial move of making an entire season based loosely on Ellen Pao's tenure as the interim CEO of Reddit (That's what this is, right?), The Walking Dead has been awarded a grade of win.  How Colonel Sanders Does Comic Con http://t.co/yEUNas71u8 pic.twitter.com/oEliZyhm2e LOSS: Someone thought it would be a good idea to email us about some ""Comic-Con shenanigans from Kentucky Fried Chicken,"" and sadly their shenanigans contained not one Colonel of win. The company famous for developing comedian Patton Oswalt's beloved failure pile in a sadness bowl befouled the streets of San Diego with Wi-Fi-enabled Colonel Sanders statues ""cosplaying"" as a vampire, a unicorn, a Martian, a werewolf, an anime character, and a furry. Anime schoolgirl Colonel Sanders has no place in this world, and KFC should apologize for what they did. An additional free-range LOSS goes out to any other brand foolish enough to make its big move on a day that belonged to Star Wars. The die is now cast and frozen in Carbonite.

But over time the good reviews got quieter and the box office cooled off, and by the time Mark Wahlberg was fighting plants in The Happening, The Sixth Sense was a distant memory. But Shyamalan has been working his way back, first with Fox's David Lynchian mystery series Wayward Pines, and now with a new, low-budget film called The Visit. Self-financed and filmed completely in secret, it tells the story of a brother and sister who visit their grandparents... only to discover strange things are afoot. I sat down with a newly reinvigorated Shyamalan here at Comic-Con for a frank and open discussion about why he went off the Hollywood grid, how he deals with audiences that may already be skeptical about his movies, and the status of one of his most interesting unrealized projects, the romantic drama Labor of Love.

Respect for the source material, respect for the fans, and respect for characters that, for everyone in Hall H last night, felt more like family than they ever had before. Here are some of our favorite moments.  Director J.J. Abrams confirmed early on that the next trailer won't be ready until the fall (the first two debuted in November and April). In its place we got about three and a half minutes of behind-the-scenes footage, which was shown to Comic-Con attendees and then posted online minutes after the panel ended. Autumn technically begins September 23rd this year, which means we shouldn't get our hopes up for a debut at Disney's D23 expo in August. Production update: Right now, Abrams and co. have a cut of the movie and are fine-tuning. The first stand-alone Anthology film, Gareth Edwards' Rogue One, will start shooting in three weeks. New evil empire The First Order has inherited the old Empire's star fighters. A red-tinted TIE Fighter — which, yes, looks like the old TIE Fighter with a new paint job — was seen in various states of wear and tear in the behind-the-scenes footage. We also got a glimpse of the Hasbro toy version earlier in the day. Because J.J. Abrams can't do a Star film without him, Star Trek 3 writer / ""Scotty"" Simon Pegg has a role in The Force Awakens. We may not see his face, however — it looks like Pegg will be fully dressed up as a khaki-colored alien. ""My whole life has led to this moment,"" he said in the video. Adam Driver, Gwendoline Christie, and Domhnall Gleeson — Kylo Ren, Captain Phasma, and General Hux, respectively — came out after the ""good guys"" (Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, and Oscar Isaac) to give a few new details. Among them: Hux is in charge of the primary First Order base — named Starkiller Base. (For you non-super-nerds, in early drafts of Star Wars, Luke was known as ""Luke Starkiller."" The name ""Starkiller"" was also featured in the video game Star Wars: The Force Unleashed, voiced by actor Sam Witwer.) Starkiller base, huh? So does that mean I'm canon again?  #SDCC2015 #StarWars Note: he's joking. Probably. The ""legacy players"" also showed up for the panel. First came Carrie Fisher (""It was a little bit like before, but we looked more melted this time""). Then Mark Hamill (""I hate to tell you guys I took a Star Wars trivia contest, and I flunked. I can't remember what Han Solo was smuggling. Was it jewels? No, it was spices!""). Then, to great applause, Harrison Ford walked out. ""I never thought it would come back to bless me instead of haunt me,"" he said. ""I was very gratified when I read the script, because I read something that I thought was really remarkable. Well written, with some intriguing developments. So I was delighted to be involved."" That's certainly one way to end a Comic-Con panel. ""Who wants to go see a live Star Wars concert right now?"" Abrams asked, before proceeding to hand out lanyards to everyone in Hall H (capacity: about 6,500). Then, Stormtroopers led the crowd to a secret location. Seriously.

All great successes — except then the company proceeded to alienate its most avid fans without giving regular consumers a clear enough message why they should buy the suddenly available devices. The Galaxy Note 5 and S6 Edge+ are two very important devices in Samsung's lineup. They assert the company's strength in the phablet category that it helped define, and they are the vehicles for two uniquely Samsung innovations: the S Pen stylus and the doubly curved Edge screen. Samsung chose to put a particular emphasis on them this year by holding a stand-alone Unpacked event in the middle of August — in lieu of the traditional early-September IFA launch that every preceding Note has received.  The stage was all set for Samsung to shake us out of our summer haze and rekindle our acquisitive passions, but then Samsung flubbed its lines. Some of that has to do with the product choices the company made. To hardcore users, the new Note looks like a regression from previous years, with its smaller battery and lack of microSD card support. Some of it is down to the tepid presentation that failed to convince anyone of the need for the Edge's screen. Samsung talked a lot about its human-centric design philosophy, and then neglected to give us any human reasons to want its new phones. Samsung needed to show its unique advantages, not just its unique technology Such was the paucity in real, tangible innovation that Samsung even resorted to showing off a BlackBerry-esque vertical keyboard attachment for its new large-screened handsets. That was an apt microcosm of Samsung's unenticing presentation: the keyboard's supposed to be the mobile typist's dream, a turbocharger for your written notes, but the person on stage only managed to thumb ""hi mom"" in his demonstration. There are plenty of single-tap emoji that can be used for that purpose. Samsung needed to show us its unique advantages, and all it showed was its unique technology. Tech companies don't have to be brilliant marketers to be successful — though it surely helps — and Samsung's uninspiring presentation could be inconsequential in the grand scheme of things. But Samsung didn't do itself many favors in its main event and followed it up with a pair of other missteps. First of all, Samsung decided against selling the Note 5 in Europe, but failed to address it in an upfront manner. That unhappy news came through in a series of uncorroborated, disbelieving reports from attendees at Samsung's London event. It would be another day before Samsung had an official statement to say that it believes the S6 Edge+ will be sufficient to satisfy Europeans' phablet needs. Europe is a pretty big place, and it would have taken Samsung mere seconds to acknowledge the change. It chose not to, because it's not awesome news, but then finding out the other way left a lot of people feeling doubly unhappy.   A 128GB Galaxy Note would be nice, wouldn't it?  Samsung also got a lot of people excited by listing 128GB versions of the Note 5 and S6 Edge+ on its website — contradicting what it had told the press — but then it had to let them all down by admitting it was a mistake. Mistakes do happen, however these ones appear to have been caused by Samsung's indecision. Reports out of Korea say that Samsung is still contemplating the introduction of 128GB variants of its new phones, and the company's marketing VP is cited as saying that a definitive decision hasn't been made yet. The same is true of Samsung's potential plans for the Galaxy Note 5 in Europe: the company says it will react to market demand and could still launch the stylus-equipped device in the market. So let's do that summary again: Samsung disappointed stylus fans in Europe and wasn't upfront about it; it frustrated power users who look to the Note series to push into ever-higher specs; and it introduced a second Edge device before it could come up with a solid reason to have even one. All of this, along with the erroneous web listings, muddled the launch and anticipation for a pair of technically impressive devices that give everyone more choice and not less. Apple is lauded for being able to get its new products in stores within two weeks, whereas Samsung is managing that in half the time. It takes a huge effort in engineering, design, and logistics to put these sophisticated devices together and to deposit them into buyers' pockets so quickly. It's just a shame Samsung's decision-making wasn't as rapid and precise as its product-making.",0.41458047617254573,0.5854195238274542,0.1496153498254353,814,4.8697788697788695,439,6.2027334851936216,0,2,"Google, Mobile, Tech, Editorial",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

OnePlus is the latest company to employ it in its marketing, and this time it’s going one further, calling its new OnePlus 2 a “2016 flagship killer.” OnePlus is essentially saying its new device is not only better than anything you can buy this year, it’s also better than anything you can buy next year. That’s quite a tall order, and for the most part, it’s pure marketing fluff. But cut through the jargon and the boasting, and you find that the OnePlus 2 is a really good smartphone. It’s a followup to the OnePlus One, which debuted about a year and a half ago with high-end specs and a rock-bottom price tag.The OnePlus 2 is very similar to its predecessor, though it’s been improved in virtually every respect. It’s still dirt cheap — $329 for a 16GB model or $389 for a 64GB version that’s unlocked and works on AT&T or T-Mobile (but not Verizon or Sprint) — and still has some high-end specs. It’s also still really hard to buy: OnePlus is using the same invite-based system to sell the phone, meaning you could be waiting a long time before you get the chance to buy one.But if you are able to buy a OnePlus 2, you’ll be rewarded with a great performing device that costs far less than a comparable Samsung Galaxy S6 or iPhone. I’ve had the chance to use the OnePlus 2 for the past week and while it’s by no means a flagship killer (this year or next), it’s actually worthy of some measure of the hype that’s surrounded it.   The design of the OnePlus 2 can best be described as utilitarian. That’s not really a knock — it’s a well-proportioned device that doesn’t have any glaring design problems. It’s just not head-turning or awe-inspiring, like Samsung’s recent Edge devices. (Nor does it have the usability problems of those devices.) The OnePlus 2 is a considerable step forward over its predecessor, with much better materials (including a metal frame) and tighter tolerances than before. It’s still big — bigger than I personally prefer — thanks to its 5.5-inch display. It’s also dense and solid-feeling, but not in a ""it’s too heavy to hold"" kind of way. Its construction certainly belies its low price, and it’s easily the best built phone I’ve used this side of $400. I really like the sandpaper-like finish of the rear cover; it reminds me of a skateboard’s grip tape, and it serves a similar purpose of keeping the phone from sliding out of my hands. You can also swap the rear cover for a few alternative designs, including real wood, if the rough back isn’t your style. Speaking of the display, it’s the same size and 1080p resolution as the OnePlus One, but it’s been improved in virtually every other respect. It’s brighter, has better colors and viewing angles, and is overall just better to look at than before. A lot of phones have more pixels in their panels, but I didn’t miss them on the OnePlus 2 and don’t have a problem with a 1080p resolution at this display size. Though the design of the OnePlus 2 is mostly utilitarian, there are a few highlights that make it different from other smartphones. The first, and my favorite, is the notification switch on the left side. It’s like the ringer switch on the iPhone, but with three settings that correspond to Android’s notifications settings: all, priority, or none. I found myself flicking the switch with my thumb just because it’s fun, and I wish more Android phones had this feature. The other unique features include a fingerprint scanner and USB Type-C port. The fingerprint scanner doubles as a home button and lets you unlock the phone without typing in a PIN code, but it doesn’t depress in the way the iPhone or Galaxy S6 fingerprint home buttons do. It’s accurate, but slow: there’s a noticeable (and annoying) delay from when I placed my thumb on the button and when the phone would recognize it. Still, it’s more convenient than typing in a PIN or tracing a pattern (either of which you can choose to do instead, if you prefer).   I’m less enthused with the USB port. Type-C is clearly the future of USB cables, and it has a lot of advantages, like the ability to be plugged in upside down and carry more information. But it’s the only way to charge the OnePlus 2 — there’s no wireless charging or even quick charging here — and it’s not easy to find USB Type-C cables yet like it is with Micro USB cables that are probably lying around in most rooms of your home or available at any convenience store. That may not be a problem in a year from now, but it still makes charging the OnePlus 2 more annoying than it should be. Fortunately, charging the OnePlus 2 is a once-daily affair for me. On most days, I’m able to go from the time I wake up to the time I go to bed without having to recharge. Still, I find it reassuring to have a way to charge in the car and at the office, so I got my hands on a few extra Type-C cables for this review just for the peace of mind. Like its hardware, the OnePlus 2’s software can also be described as utilitarian — its Oxygen OS is a barely modified version of stock Android 5.1 Lollipop with just a few usability tweaks thrown in. You can decide to have on-screen back, home, and multitasking keys; rearrange the quick settings shortcuts in the notification panel; or choose to have a dark theme. The most ambitious change is the Shelf screen, which sits at the left of the homescreen. It collects recently used apps and contacts and makes it easier to access them, but that’s about the extent of its capabilities. You can, perhaps unsurprisingly, turn it off if you don’t want it. Despite the apparently minor differences from stock Android, the OnePlus did have a few display issues with popular apps that use Google’s new Material Design theming. Apps such as Todoist, Feedly Reeder, and any other that uses the new theming options appear basic and grey on the OnePlus 2, instead of in the vibrant colors they have on other devices. OnePlus tells me that a software update is coming to address the issue, but for now, it’s a minor visual annoyance.   Part of being a flagship smartphone in 2015 is having a killer camera — both the iPhone 6 and Galaxy S6 have incredible cameras that put other phones to shame. The OnePlus 2 has a good camera on paper: it’s a 13-megapixel sensor behind a six-element f/2.0 lens with optical image stabilization and laser-assisted autofocus. In good lighting, it can take really great photos, even providing a shallow depth of field effect in close ups. In poor lighting, however, it doesn’t quite match the iPhone 6 or Galaxy S6, with dimmer images and less detail. It’s also a bit slow: there’s a noticeable lag between tapping the shutter button and the image being captured, which made it really difficult to get pictures of my seven-month-old before she moved out of frame. For every sharp picture I have of her, I have half a dozen blurry attempts. OnePlus’ founder Carl Pei has boasted that software updates are coming that will make the OnePlus 2’s camera ""the best on the market,"" so hopefully the lag is something that will be addressed. Thankfully, the camera is the only place where I experienced any sort of lag or poor performance. The OnePlus 2’s Snapdragon 810 processor and 4GB of RAM handled anything I needed, and the near-stock software didn’t bog the system down with unnecessary interface features. The phone can get warm under stress, like when playing a game, but it never gets  uncomfortable to hold. For reasons I can’t quite explain, OnePlus decided to drop NFC from the OnePlus 2, despite it being a standard feature on Android phones for years. I can’t say I agree with the decision — I missed using NFC to pay for my fare every time I was in a cab with the OnePlus 2, and with Google’s Android Pay on the horizon, it’s going to be something even more people look for. Right now, NFC is still a power-user feature, but it’s clear that OnePlus’ main customer base at this point are power users, making it a strange omission.   What does it mean to use a flagship smartphone in 2015? It likely means that you’re using a phone with a great display, fast performance, good battery life, good build quality, and a great camera. If I’m being honest, I have to say that the OnePlus 2 doesn’t hit all of those marks, but it hits most of them and does so at a price that’s just over half that of a comparable iPhone. It’s not a flagship killer by any means — this year or next — but it’s a really solid smartphone that does most everything you need it to do really well. It’s easily the best deal on the market right now if you want a high-end smartphone. That makes me wonder: where do we go from here? Will companies like OnePlus continue to be able to push the price envelope further down, while still providing a high-level experience? As my colleague Vlad Savov recently pointed out, that price you pay for a smartphone goes into far more than just the hardware itself: it covers things like fair labor practices, support staff, future support with software updates, and hardware recalls. As it is, OnePlus has to resort to unconventional means to sell its phones as low as it does, including convoluted invite systems, long lead times on orders, and zero retail presence. That’s fine for the enthusiast crowd that has flocked to OnePlus’ website to sign up for a chance to buy one, but explain that to the average person that walks into their carrier store to buy a new phone and you’ll likely be met with a blank stare. Concerns for the future of the smartphone industry aside, if you are able to snag an invite and buy a OnePlus 2, you’ll be rewarded with a utilitarian device that’s more business than party, but is still pretty great. If the OnePlus 2 was priced at the same level as an iPhone or Galaxy S6, it’d be easy to forget about it and move on. But in the context of its extremely low price, it’s hard to really take much issue with its few faults, making it a winner in my book. And it didn’t have to kill anything to get there.",0.5182957455995482,0.48170425440045184,0.17208666168487588,1835,4.6119891008174383,761,6.0170827858081468,0,16,"Google, Mobile, Tech, Review",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The Speedo Shine is functionally and aesthetically similar to the earlier Misfit Shine, but incorporates a new tracking algorithm for swimming that the company claims offers ""industry-leading accuracy"" whatever stroke — butterfly or front crawl — the user is deploying. The Speedo Shine also monitors sports and activity outside the pool as well as tracking sleep, syncing its data via Bluetooth to the iOS and Android Misfit app. Like the original Shine, the Speedo Shine has one notable advantage over many of its competitors: it doesn't look like technology. The device is slim (just 8.6 millimeters thick) with a battery that can last up to six months and is made of machined aluminum that's waterproof to 50 meters. And instead of a full display, it uses 12 LEDs set around the device's perimeter to let wearers track their progress toward their daily activity goal. Like its predecessor, the Speedo Shine gets points for not looking like technology This absence of a fine-tuned counter might be a welcome change for those tired of zealous activity trackers that needle them over every step, but it's not clear if this lack of accuracy might also apply (in a less welcome fashion) to the Speed Shine's performance in the pool. Misfit says that it's run batteries of tests on the device's accuracy while swimming, but isn't making any specific claims because, it says, real world conditions are just too difficult to control for. This means that until there are hands-on reviews, it's difficult to know just how accurate the Speedo Shine is when you're giving it your all in the pool.

But now Nuance, arguably the leader in speech to text, thinks it has a good reason for people to start paying for one: it's coming out with a new app called Dragon Anywhere that's supposed to be far more powerful at dictation than anything Apple or Google can offer.  Just make sure you have a good connection Dragon Anywhere will launch later this fall for iOS and Android. It's essentially just a notepad app, but it's supposed to be able to accept endless voice input, so you don't have to stop and wait for results every 30 seconds or so like you have to with Siri's dictation. Nuance says that transcriptions should appear pretty much clause by clause, but you'll need to be on a good internet connection for that to happen — during a demo of the app, Vox Media's patchy Wi-Fi connection meant that transcriptions came through in piecemeal chunks. They always appeared eventually, however, and they were quite accurate. The app also allows speakers to navigate through a document using voice commands. That includes moving between entry fields in a form and actually editing the transcribed text, using commands to select words or sections and apply changes to them. Dragon Anywhere iOS screenshotsPreviousNextView full GalleryPreviousNext Nuance is well aware that most people don't need to do that much transcription, which is why it's designing Dragon Anywhere more as an office tool than a casual writing app. In addition to transcription and editing, the app also allows speakers to create custom dictionaries and text shortcuts, which expand into larger blocks of prewritten text. Custom words and expanders can be synced between devices and over to new Dragon desktop apps for Mac and PC. The big downside is that Dragon Anywhere will only be available as a subscription — not as an outright purchase. Running servers to handle all of those transcriptions is expensive, Nuance says, but the subscription allows it to handle dictation without forcing speakers to take a break. The new Dragon desktop apps will be sold at a flat price, however. Nuance hasn't decided on a price for the subscription just yet. Nuance says that doctors are heavy users of its desktop apps Nuance seems pretty confident that there's a market of professionals — doctors, service workers, and basically anyone who's regularly filling out forms or jotting down long observations — who'll sign up to use Dragon Anywhere. At the very least, there are clear reasons to use this app over built-in dictation tools or Nuance's old Dragon Dictation app, which hasn't been updated in over two years. Though the prominence of mobile dictation tools may seem to put Nuance in a tough spot, that's not really the case. Nuance's technology is quietly used to power some of those very tools, including Samsung's S Voice. It's also believed to be behind Siri — or at least it was at some point several years ago (Nuance declined to discuss any dealings with Apple). That means Nuance already has a prominent position in mobile, but it'll need apps like Dragon Anywhere to get its name in front of consumers.",0.47787270576922347,0.5221272942307765,0.14968972394502741,540,4.9314814814814811,311,5.771704180064309,0,0,"Apps, Tech",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

While that's great news for those with the virus, it also means that they're starting to face the medical complications that crop up with old age — like organ failure. Researchers have been experimenting with transplants between HIV-positive donors and HIV-positive recipients, and a new study shows that these can be done with increasingly promising results.  Early results led to the US lifting a research ban When doctors from Groote Schuur Hospital in South Africa first reported on their work transplanting kidneys between HIV-positive patients back in 2010, the results were so positive that it led the United States to lift a research ban on the practice. It's now five years later, and that same hospital is publishing the results of how its original patients are doing in The New England Journal of Medicine. The report includes more than 20 additional patients, after an average of about three years following the transplant. The hospital found that the survival rate following a transplant between HIV-positive patients is only modestly lower than the survival rates for a transplant in someone who is HIV-negative. For HIV-positive patients, there was an 84 percent survival rate one year after surgery and a 74 percent rate at five years. That's compared to rates of 91 percent and 85 percent for HIV-negative patients in the same hospital unit. Though the trial focused entirely on kidney transplants, the doctors behind it believe that these results show the procedure has potential for broader use. ""Using HIV-positive donors might resolve some of the problems we are experiencing in getting enough donors for our patients with [chronic kidney disease] worldwide,"" Elmi Muller, the study's lead author, writes in an email to The Verge. ""The question is, 'What is the risk of getting the transplants compared to the risk of not doing the transplant?'"" One early worry was that a more treatment-resistant form of HIV could transfer from a donor to a recipient; fortunately, the doctors saw no sign of increased viral levels after the transplant. That doesn't mean there wasn't some risk to the patients, though. Five patients died within a year after the transplant from various causes, including cancer and heart problems. And transplant rejection was also a problem: of the 24 patients who survived the transplant, five patients had rejections, with eight rejections occurring in total. Prior research has found that organ rejection is more common in HIV-positive recipients — so this may not be a complication specific to receiving an organ from an HIV-positive donor. Even with the added risk, doctors still see reasons to pursue HIV-positive transplants. ""The question is not, 'What is the additional risk of doing the transplant?'"" Dorry Segev, a transplant surgeon with Johns Hopkins Medicine who was not involved with the study, tells The Verge. ""The question is, 'What is the risk of getting the transplants compared to the risk of not doing the transplant?' And in not doing the transplant, HIV patients have a much higher risk of dying on dialysis. Much higher than their HIV-negative counterparts."" That's particularly pertinent in South Africa, where HIV is more prevalent and more donors are needed. ""Because of very high HIV rates in South Africa, more and more HIV-positive, brain-dead donors [are] presented to the Groote Schuur Hospital transplant team,"" Muller writes. ""In South Africa it made sense to try and marry this supply of donors with the group of HIV-positive patients without any treatment options in the country."" Only deceased donors were used in Muller's study. Muller expects to work with other organs in ""the next few years."" This is also about more than kidneys. Muller chose to begin with kidney transplants because, she says, kidney problems are ""very prevalent in HIV-positive patients,"" while other issues, like liver and heart failure, occur at rates similar to the general population. But it's likely that the practice will eventually expand to other organs. ""Liver transplants are more complicated and logistically more difficult,"" Muller writes. ""But I do think we will expand it over the next few years. Segev hopes to see transplants between HIV-positive patients start soon in the US. In fact, following the release of Muller's initial study, he worked with Congress to pass the HOPE (HIV Organ Policy Equity) Act in 2013, which could eventually lead to the use of organs from HIV-positive donors. At the time, President Obama expressed support for continued research. ""The potential for successful organ transplants between people living with HIV has become more of a possibility,"" the president said. Segev's research has estimated that thousands of lives could be saved each year by accepting HIV-positive donors. Though the HOPE Act has been passed, Segev says that the Health Department still needs to create the guidelines under which these trials can be run. He expects to see transplants start in the US in about a year. If it goes well, he says they could be widespread within about three years. ""The outcomes are actually really encouraging."" It's possible that some complications will come up bringing the procedure from South Africa to the United States. Because patients in South Africa may have less access to antiretroviral medication, there's less resistance there and drugs are likely to be more effective. Still, Segev says that medications have come far enough that it shouldn't significantly complicate US transplants. ""It's highly unlikely even in the US they will receive an [antiretroviral therapy] resistance that is untreatable,"" he says. ""The biggest takeaways are that the outcomes are actually really encouraging,"" Segev says. ""...This really is another reminder that we need to move forward in the United States with doing this.""",0.49225620311188645,0.5077437968881136,0.8415035351292128,947,5.2259767687433998,448,6.1584821428571432,0,0,Science,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Obesity is determined by both by a person’s environment and their genetics. But until recently, researchers didn’t know exactly what role various regions of our DNA played in determining how human bodies look. Now, researchers have linked multiple new regions of the human genome to body mass index (BMI) and fat distribution, according to two new studies published in Nature today. And the findings could have a large impact on how we understand obesity — as well as how we define it. More than one-third of adults in the US are obese ""Before we did the study, we knew that about 50 percent of the body mass index — a measure of obesity — is genetic, but we didn’t know exactly the genetic elements that contributed to that,"" says Elizabeth Speliotes, a geneticist at the University of Michigan and a co-author of the study that deals with the genetics of BMI. ""So basically the aim of our study was to identify some of the genetic components that contribute to obesity."" More than one-third of adults in the US are obese, according to the CDC. The condition has been linked to health problems such as cancer, stroke, Type 2 diabetes, and heart disease. As a result, obesity cost the country a total of $147 billion in medical fees in 2008 — a burden that scientists think could be lowered if they understood obesity and its genetic origins better. In both studies, researchers recorded the physical characteristics of over 220,000 study participants of all shapes and sizes. Then, they correlated these data with genetic regions in their DNA. ""We found 97 different regions of the genome that are associated with BMI,"" Speliotes says — 56 of which were completely novel. The researchers involved in the second study found 33 new genetic regions associated with waist and hip circumference. ""Because there are so many new [genetic regions], we can understand the underlying biology,""  says Karen Mohlke, a geneticist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and a co-author of the fat distribution study. ""This helped us recognize that the programming behind how fat develops plays a major role in how the body fat is distributed."" ""the programming behind how fat develops plays a major role in how the body fat is distributed."" Even though the two studies used similar approaches, the implications of their findings are very different. The genes surrounding the genetic regions identified in the fat distribution study tend to affect fat cell development, blood vessel formation, and metabolic processes, Mohlke says. This means that the regions the researchers identified likely play a role in these processes as well. Mohlke's team also found that some genetic regions have stronger effects in men than they do in women — a finding that may explain why fat distribution varies between the sexes. The regions involved in BMI were different than those involved in fat distribution, as many are associated with the nervous system. ""That’s interesting; I mean, when we started working on obesity, we didn’t consider this a neuronal process,"" Speliotes says. ""Most people think of it as a metabolic process."" obesity may also be a ""neuronal process."" The nervous system might therefore play a larger role in determining BMI than we previously thought, although exactly what that role is remains unclear. For now, all Speliotes can say is that ""there is a very strong neurological component to people’s BMI predisposition."" The BMI team also put numbers to the impact of the 97 genetic regions they identified. Speliotes explains this by using an ordinary person as an example. ""Take a human of average height,"" she says. Each human carries two alleles — a specific region on a chromosome — for each of the 97 BMI-related regions they identified, and these alleles may or may not increase a person’s BMI relative to the average. Now, if that normal-sized individual carries more than 104 BMI-increasing alleles, they will be 20 to 24 pounds heavier on average than someone of similar height carrying less than 78 BMI-increasing alleles —  ""a medically significant difference,"" she says. everyone has a genetic predisposition to a certain BMI The findings in both studies don’t just relate to obese and overweight individuals, however, because everyone has a genetic predisposition to a certain BMI. Looking into the genetic basis for obesity might therefore help researchers uncover how BMI and body fat distribution is determined for everyone — at least as far as the genetic factors go. There are probably a lot more regions to discover. Speliotes' team estimates that there may over one thousand additional genetic regions that can affect a person’s BMI. And because both studies looked at mostly white participants, it’s also possible that future studies conducted on non-white populations will uncover additional genetic regions that impact BMI and body fat distribution. Still, Speliotes says that the effects of the genetic regions identified in her study are largely universal. ""We did study some African-Americans and Asians, and in fact most of the regions that we find are associated with BMI in [people of European descent] do have an effect on those ancestries as well,"" she says. ""It may not be every variant all the time — but a lot of them."" It’s now clear that the source of obesity — and perhaps its classification — can differ widely from person to person. ""If people were expecting us to find one gene to cure obesity, that’s just not how this trait works,"" Speliotes says. Many different genetic components contribute to the way our bodies look — and that’s without taking environmental factors, such as diet and exercise, into account. Depending on which genetic combinations a person possesses,  their BMI may be more regulated by one set of genetic variants than another. Understanding how these combinations work will take a lot more research and time, but studies like these show that we’re getting closer. ""Obesity is one of the biggest medical menaces of our time."" ""It’s not just you and your bad habits; it’s not fully volitional,"" Speliotes says. Some people are more predisposed to have higher BMIs than others. In addition, some patients don’t respond to conventional weight-loss methods, and that may also be tied to their DNA. If researchers can figure out how obesity ""works,"" they might be able to make drugs that target different forms of obesity with few side-effects. ""Obesity is one of the biggest medical menaces of our time, and it’s very clear to me that we aren’t doing a very good job of helping people with obesity,"" Speliotes says. That’s why she thinks we can ""do more by trying to understand this and figure out how it works"" than by ""telling people to exercise and eat less.""

The methods we use to detect brain activity are limited as well — even when researchers know what they're trying to track, the tools can only do so much, says Eric Schreiter, researcher at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Janelia research campus and co-author of a study released today in Science. But his team thinks it's found a way to help. The most direct way to see what neurons are doing would be to just track the impulses as they fire. ""It's possible to measure that electrical signal, but it turns out to be really difficult,"" Schreiter says. Instead, he cites two basic approaches, both of which come with a set of tradeoffs. One method uses fluorescent proteins — perhaps best known for producing glow-in-the-dark mice or rabbits — as sensors that get brighter when they bind to calcium and dim as it dissipates. Neuron activity is accompanied by a sudden spike in calcium, so if you introduce them into an animal and get a microscopic look at its brain, you’ll be able to see the proteins light up as it happens. ""It's actually quite beautiful."" But your view is limited to small areas, and there’s no permanent record of it. ""As soon as you move your microscope or you turn your microscope off there's no way to know where that activity was,"" says Schreiter. If you’re looking for a wider view, on the other hand, it’s possible to track a subset of genes that are expressed during brain activity, but this measures neurons only over longer periods of time. To address these limitations, Schreiter and his team split the difference between the two: you can get a permanent record of activity across a whole brain, but it can capture things that happen over a span of seconds, not tens of minutes or hours. Technically, it’s a twist on the calcium-tracking technique. The work started with an attempt to make a protein’s color change easier to detect — instead of going from green to more intense green, researchers created one that turned permanently from green to red when exposed to violet light. Modified to only respond in the presence of calcium as well as light, it becomes a neuron tracking tool. The designation — ""calcium-modulated photoactivatable ratiometric integrator"" — is a mouthful, but it shortens to the much more palatable name of CaMPARI. The CaMPARI protein is still in 'version 1.0' The team has so far tested the protein in mice, fruit flies, and zebrafish larvae to measure brain activity. Zebrafish, for example, were exposed to the protein and then set under violet light in various conditions: anesthetized, swimming freely, or put in extreme heat and cold. (A larval zebrafish’s skin is transparent, which makes flooding the brains with light easy; for animals like mice, researchers have to cut a window into the skull.) When their brains were imaged afterwards, they had permanently recorded the neural activity in a mix of green and magenta. ""It's actually quite beautiful,"" Schreiter says. While green fluorescent proteins were first isolated from jellyfish in the 1960s, Researcher Roger Tsien is credited with turning them into a range of tagging tools in the mid-’90s (he won a Nobel Prize in 2008 for his efforts.) Since then, scientists have been steadily refining and elaborating upon the technique, looking for new colors and new behaviors. MIT scientists, for example, developed a protein that responded to calcium only in specific cell types. Schreiter says it's too early to tell what CaMPARI's applications might be, but at the very least, real-time, flexible, but permanent imaging could give scientists a new way to get quick feedback when tracking an animal's actions. ""We don't know what all of those applications are going to be,"" he says. ""Our job is really to get these new tools into the hands of as many biologists as we can."" The CaMPARI method is in an early stage, Schreiter says. Right now, animals need to be flooded with more light than he’d like — it can affect their behavior and damage the brain tissue. And the group wants to adapt the protein to work with other signals, not just calcium, he says. ""We've called this like, version 1.0 of a new tool.""

But as it turns out, there’s way more plastic than we thought. About 5 to 13 million metric tons of plastic flowed into the ocean in 2010, according to a study from a group of oceanographers, engineers, ecologists, and other researchers published in Science today. That’s 20 to 20,000 times as much as we knew was floating on top of the ocean, Sea Education Association investigator Kara Lavender Law said during a press conference announcing the findings. A lot of the plastic sinks to the ocean floor or floats in the water column. There’s plastic in Arctic Sea ice and plastic on beaches around the world. Much of it breaks down into tiny, even microscopic pieces, which get eaten by organisms that we sometimes consume ourselves; the consequences of that are still being studied. The amount of plastic is staggering The source of the problem isn't mysterious: there’s a lot of plastic in the ocean because humans use a lot of plastic. The amount is staggering. Plastic has only been in wide use for about 65 years, yet it’s outstripped production of almost every metal, University of California Santa Barbara professor Roland Geyer pointed out during the conference. The 192 coastal countries included in the study produced 275 million metric tons of plastic waste in 2010. A significant amount of that ended up in the ocean. In the study, the panel looked at how much waste was produced annually by each person living in 192 coastal countries, the population density within 50 kilometers of the coast, and what percentage of the waste they produced was plastic. From there, the researchers looked at waste management practices to find how much of that plastic was available to enter the ocean: they ended up with a range of 4.8 to 12.7 million metric tons.  ""That’s the same as five bags like this filled with plastic for every foot of coastline in the world."" To illustrate what eight tons — the middle range — looks like, University of Georgia professor Jenna Jambeck held up a large shopping bag filled with plastic at the conference. ""That’s the same as five bags like this filled with plastic for every foot of coastline in the world,"" she said. By 2025, she said there would be the equivalent of 10 bags per foot of coastline entering the ocean each year. The study also ranks the main offenders. They were mostly countries with rapidly growing economies that haven’t developed good waste management programs yet. China lead by a long shot, then came Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam, and Sri Lanka. But then there was the United States, whose large coastal population and high use of plastic placed it at number 20, despite having by far the best waste management system on the list. There’s plastic in arctic sea ice and plastic on beaches around the world Getting the plastic out of the ocean isn’t feasible, the researchers concluded, so we need to keep any more from getting in. They suggest two tactics. The first is to get rapidly expanding countries like China to institute better waste management programs. The second involves getting wealthy countries like the United States to stop generating so much plastic waste. Either of these approaches could do a lot of good. A 50 percent increase in effective waste disposal by the top 20 countries would result in a 41 percent drop in mismanaged plastic waste by 2025, whereas a decrease in per-capita plastic generation to something closer to the 2010 average for the top 91 countries would result in a 26 percent decrease. For that reason, Jambeck said she was optimistic, though the way she expressed her optimism seemed cautious at best.",0.579130922824323,0.420869077175677,0.8684683203038323,652,4.8819018404907979,334,5.8323353293413174,0,0,Science,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The rocket’s stage and payload fairing separations were backlit by a gorgeous sunset. DSCOVR is a joint collaboration between NASA, NOAA, and the US Air Force, each responsible for one-third of the $340 million price tag. NOAA served as the mission manager, NASA handled the science instruments, while the Air Force selected the vehicle that would propel DSCOVR into deep space. Based on mission requirements, the Air Force selected SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket as the launch vehicle.     Today’s flight was a pathfinder mission for SpaceX, which hopes to gain more government contracts in the future. It is also a mission of firsts — first venture beyond geostationary orbit (GEO) for NOAA, first deep space mission for the agency, and the first mission with SpaceX as the launch provider. DSCOVR started as an Earth science mission. Now, though, it’s our planet’s new line of defense against solar storms. The refrigerator-sized satellite — stationed one million miles from Earth — is designed to provide advanced warning against solar flares that could result in damaging geomagnetic storms. Geomagnetic storms can flood power grids with additional electric currents, potentially blowing transformers and even resulting in complete power grid failure. Communication systems, such as GPS and cell phones, and transatlantic flights can be disrupted by these storms. Space weather, like Earth weather, is ranked on a scale of low to high-risk. The Geomagnetic scale ranges from G1 (low-risk) to G5 (high-risk). Any storm ranked G3 or higher has the potential for damage on Earth. think of dscovr as a high-tech tsunami buoy Think of DSCOVR as a high-tech tsunami buoy — providing 15–60 minutes of lead time for incoming severe space weather.

And that’s crucial, since space weather and geomagnetic storms are proven threats to virtually every major public infrastructure we have, and could potentially cause billions of dollars worth of damage.   DSCOVR will end up at the Lagrange Point 1, or L1 for short, 930,000 miles (1.5 million kilometers) from Earth. Once there, it will orbit the Sun four times further out into space than the Moon. Like most of us, the DSCOVR satellite has a complicated past. The mission initially was conceived with a different purpose by then-Vice President Al Gore, and dubbed Triana, for Rodrigo de Triana, the first European sailor to ""discover"" the Americas since the Viking era. The original focus of the mission was to find out the amount of heat that’s trapped in our atmosphere — a key measurement in the fight against global warming. The Triana mission was first developed in 1998, but when Gore lost the presidential election in 2000, the project was suspended and the satellite was put in storage. when gore lost the presidential election in 2000, the project was suspended and the satellite was put in storage Thanks to the lobbying efforts of Senator Bill Nelson, the Democrat from Florida who in 1986 spent six days orbiting the Earth on the space shuttle Columbia; Senator Barbara Mikulski, a Democrat from Maryland; and many hardworking scientists, the mission was brought before the Committee of Space Environmental Sensor Mitigation Options, an off-shoot of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy in 2008. ""Bill Nelson was a behind-the-scenes ninja working hard to get DSCOVR to fly,"" Gore tells The Verge. Because of that meeting, the mission was revived later that year, when NOAA commissioned NASA to test and refurbish the dormant satellite — and as a result, the 15-year-old satellite is in better shape today than when it was put into storage. The upgraded satellite got a new name, and a new mission: DSCOVR’s main purpose now is space weather. But the original idea survives as a secondary mission objective. We’ll get a more accurate picture of Earth’s energy budget, too. Currently, there are satellites designed to study the amount of energy the Earth receives from the Sun; however, DSCOVR will be the first satellite designed to measure the amount of energy reflected back into space from the Earth. The difference between these two numbers will accurately tell us how much energy is trapped in our atmosphere. That information will give scientists will a more complete image of global warming and climate change.   That’s not all: expect some spectacular Earth views. One of the instruments on board DSCOVR is the Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera, also known as ""EPIC"". This camera is designed to capture daily views of the sunlit side of Earth. One of EPIC’s tasks is providing daily pictures of the Earth — as seen from 1 million miles away. Forty-seven years ago, humanity got its the first look at our home planet from space as the crew of Apollo 8 beamed back the now famous ""Earthrise"" image. At L1, DSCOVR and its EPIC camera are situated at a distance of four times that of Earth to the Moon, so the images beamed back will be like none we have ever seen before. The images will be available to the public starting in late July to early August, after the satellite is fully operational, and can be viewed here. ""We had a different perspective of ourselves when we saw Earth for the first time from the lunar orbit looking back,"" says Nelson, in an interview with The Verge. ""Our planet was only as large as a thumbnail, and this really showed us our relationship to the cosmos."" The photos from EPIC will help in the study of atmospheric aerosols, which are tiny particles in the air. They come in many varieties, both natural and artificial — but the suspended particles can include dust and pollutants, known factors in making asthma and allergies worse. the mission is also important for spacex. The mission is also important for SpaceX, which is trying to create reusable rockets.Their Falcon 9 v1.1 is a two-stage vehicle: the first stage powered by nine Merlin 1D engines, roughly equivalent to one of the five engines on the mighty Saturn V rocket; the second stage is powered by just one of those engines. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk named the rocket after the famed Millennium Falcon from the Star Wars franchise. Landing on a stormy sea pic.twitter.com/7EY25g3IU5 Last month, SpaceX attempted to land the Falcon’s first stage on a floating barge — a world first. In order to facilitate the landing, deployable grid fins were added to the first stage, to help with steering. The fins are powered by hydraulic fluid, which ran out prematurely during the first attempt, resulting in the first stage crashing into the side of the drone ship. Initially, SpaceX said it would try a second landing attempt with the Falcon, after the DSCOVR launch. But the drone ship lost one of its stabilizing engines, and the seas were choppy. After the launch, Musk tweeted that first stage landed ""nicely vertical"" in the ocean.   SpaceX will have to wait until March or April before it can attempt another landing on one of the two barges they’ve named for spaceships in Ian M. Banks’ novel The Player of Games. The company is also scheduled to launch a rocket on February 28, but the Falcon used in that flight doesn’t have landing legs.   The barges are just the first step. The next goal for SpaceX is a landing pad at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida — the repurposed launch pad SLC–13, which was first used in 1958 to launch Atlas missiles. That site is the most-used and longest-serving of the original Atlas launch pads; the pad was last used in 1978 and labeled a historic site in 1984. The site deteriorated over the years, and currently nothing remains but a pile of rubble after the blockhouse was demolished in 2012. SpaceX is leasing the site for five years from the Air Force. On the bank of the causeway, you wait — will this be the time? Years of delays plagued the DSCOVR mission — and delays even carried over to the launch pad. On the bank of the causeway, with just about three miles of water between you and the pad, you wait — will this be the time? Then you see it, a bright flash of light as the engines ignite and the vehicle rises off the pad. At that point, about 30 seconds after launch, you can hear and feel the shockwave from the rocket travel across the causeway. Emotion hits you just like the wave of sound from the rocket: an almost overwhelming sense of accomplishment. Not because you played a part in this launch, but because it is satisfying to witness.

Led by NASA climate scientist Benjamin Cook, the team tracked three different drought indices for the American southwest and central plains over the past thousand years. The team then compared the historical record to climate projections of the next century. The result was a bleak forecast. Under current projections, the next hundred years are set to be significantly drier for the region than any other period on record. ""The dry are getting drier."" There will be a little less rain for arid regions like the southwest and central plains over the next 100 years, but most of the changes will come from warmer temperatures leading to more evaporation and drier soil, according to the models used in the study. Adding the expected changes together, the scientists found stronger drought conditions than anything the region has seen in the past millennium even during the 200-year dry spell between 1100 and 1300. The study didn't control for human factors, however, which could potentially render the region even drier if water use from habitation and agriculture continues to grow.   The study is based on 17 projections from the CMIP5 climate model, an internationally managed collection climate projection that dates back to 2011. There are a number of more recent models outside the CMIP5, but University of Illinois climate scientist Donald Wuebbles says other models are likely to produce similar results. ""One of the things that they find in essentially all the models is, the wet are getting wetter and the dry are getting drier,"" says Wuebbles, who didn’t participate in the study. ""It's really not too shocking that you would get a strong trend in droughts."" NASA’s Cook hopes further research will unlock more regional detail within the southwest and central plains, but the most urgent work will have more to do with time than geography. ""The big question is when these areas will start to transition to these much drier conditions,"" Cook says.

Previous work touting the beneficial effects of drinking has been skewed by poor sampling techniques, says Craig Knott, lead author of the new research, most notably the habit of grouping together individuals who have never drunk alcohol with those who have stopped drinking. Knott and his colleagues came to their conclusion after looking at ten years of health data covering more than 50,000 individuals older than 50 from England. The team found that comparing drinkers with individuals who had never drunk before showed that low alcohol consumption provided only slight health benefits for two groups of light drinkers: men aged 50 to 64 and women aged 64 and over. The alcohol intake for these groups was small — less than a small glass of wine a day for women or less than a large glass a day for men — and the researchers stressed that even these results might still be the result of selection biases. These could include surveying individuals who are in professional employment and easier to contact, but are also healthier overall than the general population. Studies painting drinking in a positive light trickle into the public conscious These sorts of biases are exactly what have led to a flurry of articles in recent years all touting the supposed health benefits of drinking — these studies are catnip to reporters because they’re counterintuitive and easily shared. Arguing over the slight benefits of small amounts of alcohol may seem trivial (especially as the damage caused by serious drinking is not in doubt), but Knott says this isn’t the case. Studies painting drinking in even a slightly positive light trickle into the public conscious, giving people an excuse, no matter how silly, for grabbing another drink. And the studies also affect legislation. An editorial in the BMJ accompanying the new research points out that ""politicians [have] used evidence on possible benefits to justify the failure to act on reducing harms"" while the alcohol industry ""assiduously promoted this evidence, both to reassure customers and to argue against ... policies."" ""non-drinkers are far from a homogeneous group."" However, it’s biases in the original studies that are creating the misinformation in the first place. Knott says that he and his team looked at a meta-analysis of 34 studies and found that studies showing the positive benefits of alcohol often made the mistake of straightforwardly comparing drinkers and non-drinkers. ""Unfortunately, non-drinkers are far from a homogeneous group,"" says Knott via email, with the category including ""both former drinkers and never drinkers."" Because former drinkers have increased rates of depression, report worse health on average, and have increased health risks in general, lumping them in with lifelong teetotalers skews the results significantly, says Knott. What’s more, of the studies he and his team examined, only two broke their information down into age groups that included over-64s — a glaring omission, as older individuals are less able to metabolise alcohol and are also more likely to have chronic illnesses. Not separating this group out from younger individuals could skew the results — one of the reason that the new study focused on older age groups. ""If something looks too good to  be true, it should be treated with caution."" ""Given the harms attributed to alcohol use, it is not surprising that reports showing possible mortality benefits for low level users attracted enthusiasm among consumers, the media, and the alcohol industry,"" says the editorial, adding that ""in health as elsewhere, if something looks too good to be true, it should be treated with great caution.""",0.4406722218792817,0.5593277781207183,0.8432810273411654,618,5.2233009708737868,323,6.2817337461300307,0,0,Science,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Turns out, as Polygon notes, that Jamie Lee Curtis is a fighting game fan. It also turns out, as we choose to believe, that Jamie Lee Curtis has been playing Vega since the character's debut in 1991's Street Fighter II (known as Balrog in Japan).

Jamie Lee Curtis, that's who! pic.twitter.com/UuC95GwlJf  Rainbow SuplexWhen close, press back or forward + Medium Punch or High Punch Jamie Lee Curtis walks up to the opponent with her arms outstretched, asking why we fight at all — I mean, what's the point really? The money isn't enough to sustain a healthy lifestyle, our skill sets would qualify us for better-paying, lower-risk employment, and besides, there's only maybe three people watching from across the fence. Jamie Lee Curtis then offers the opponent a hug, before revealing this to be a true lie, grabbing the opponent with superhuman JLC strength, and throwing the opponent over her shoulder. Rolling Crystal FlashHold back, then press forward + Low, Medium, or High Punch Jamie Lee Curtis backs up a few steps, motioning with her claw hand that the opponent has something on his or her nose. When the opponent, appreciative of the concern and embarrassed about the presumed out-facing booger, reaches up to check on his or her news, Jamie Lee Curtis reveals this to be a true lie, launching herself toward the opponent with a powerful forward role.   Sky High ClawHold down, then press up + Low, Medium, or High Punch Jamie Lee Curtis fools her opponent into thinking she's tying her shoe before revealing that to be a true lie, jumping toward a wall, and then launching head-and-claw first into the opponent.

Izuna DropHold down, then press up + Low, Medium, or High Kick, then press left or right + Low, Medium, or High Punch Jamie Lee Curtis jumps toward a nearby wall, exhausting the opponent into wondering aloud, ""okay, what is Jamie Lee Curtis going to do this time around?"" The opponent prepares for some claw-based attack before Jamie Lee Curtis reveals that to be a true lie, grabbing the opponent at the last minute, and performing some kind of mid-air suplex. This typically breaks the opponent's neck, based on the relative point of impact with the ground.   Scarlet TerrorHold diagonally down-and-to-the-back, then press forward + Low, Medium, or High Kick Jamie Lee Curtis bends down as if to tie her shoe. The opponent screams ""C'mon! Seriously! You tried this already and you have no shoe laces!"" Jamie Lee Curtis says, ""No, seriously, I think I've lost my contact lens, can you please help me find it?"" The opponent, charmed by Jamie Lee Curtis' affable and charming demeanor, both figuratively and physically lets his or her guard down and walks over looking for the missing contact lens so that the fight can continue. At that point, Jamie Lee Curtis reveals the ruse to be a true lie, back-flipping into the air and kicking the opponent with her lace-free shoes.   SUPER: Rolling Izuna DropHold diagonally down-and-to-the-back, then roll the joystick in a half circle from forward to down to back, then press diagonally up-and-to-the-front + Low, Medium, or High Kick, then when close, press back or forward + Low, Medium, or High Punch ""The only true lie today was you thinking you could defeat me!"" Jamie Lee Curtis drops to one knee but makes no attempt to fool the opponent into looking for a contact lens or tying a shoe with no laces. ""To call you stupid would be an insult to stupid people!"" she screams. ""I've known sheep that could outwit you. I've worn dresses with higher IQs!"" The opponent keeps his or her distance. Jamie Lee Curtis growls, ""the only true lie today was you thinking you could defeat me"" before jumping towards a nearby wall and hurling herself towards the opponent with the strength of a Harrier Jet. ""JAMIE LEE CURTIS SMASH!!!!!!!!"" she bellows as she seems to magically grab the opponent from behind (despite launching from the front), holding onto the opponent while shadows of all her past characters join in to perform not one, not two, but three sequential suplexes. ""And they said I'd never do a trilogy,"" she quips, standing over an opponent whose life has long escaped.

It’s a premise that should have raised countless, thought-provoking questions about relationships, aging, income inequality, and what makes a life worth living. As it is, the most fun I had with Self/less was using it as an excuse to watch two far better identity-swapping movies, 1966 thriller Seconds and 2015 indie film Advantageous — and a chance to map out what the perennial sci-fi trope actually means.   Stories about putting our own minds in another body tend to split into two distinct and nearly opposing themes. As soon as the first trailer for Self/less dropped, it immediately called to mind the 2011 comedy The Change-Up, which is also about Ryan Reynolds switching bodies with an older man. But The Change-Up is part of a very specific subset of comedy — call it the Freaky Friday genre (as, naturally, TV Tropes does). Whether they’re crass or poignant, these are ultimately stories about empathy, supernatural successors to Mark Twain’s The Prince and the Pauper. The actual phenomenon of the switch is explained with some variation of ""a wizard did it,"" and the central hook is watching characters alternately learn about and screw up each others’ lives. People in Self/less don’t swap minds so much as destroy them. Ben Kingsley’s character isn’t giving anything back, he’s just moving from a dying husk to a fresh one. It’s an ultimately boring version of a nearly infinite number of far weirder and more effective science fiction and horror stories. There are echoes of it in Richard K. Morgan’s Altered Carbon, in which minds can be downloaded to different bodies or backed up on servers — under certain circumstances, you can lose your own body to a rich buyer, who can effectively live forever by swapping ""sleeves."" Or in Harlan Ellison’s Mefisto in Onyx, a piece of hardboiled horror about a man who can ""shrike"" from body to body. Even H.P. Lovecraft toys with it, taking the idea of the old possessing the young to its logical and incredibly creepy conclusion in ""The Thing on the Doorstep."" Moving from a dying husk to a fresh one You could say there’s something Lovecraftian about the whole idea of the old coming back again and again to colonize the young, but the trope as a whole is a lot bigger than that. It’s also not, ultimately, what Self/less wants to be about. Self/less is a mid-life (or, technically, end-of-life) crisis film, about a man who’s found traditional success but wishes he could go back to the simple physical pleasures of youth. It's much more directly comparable to Seconds, which actually isn’t about swapping bodies at all — just changing them. Aside from an extended nude grape-stomping scene – which is exactly as weird as it sounds — Seconds could easily pass as a film-length episode of The Twilight Zone. For the most part, it has the same tense, methodical pacing, and it covers a familiar Twilight Zone theme: the aging, misunderstood white-collar man who gets a second chance at life and should be very careful what he wishes for. In this case, he’s a man named Arthur Hamilton (played by then-blacklisted actor John Randolph) with a loveless marriage and a distant daughter. He’s invited to a mysterious agency known only as The Company, where he reluctantly agrees to extreme plastic surgery and a new, glamorous life as a painter with the face and physique of Rock Hudson. The Company turns out to have even darker secrets than the body-snatching startup of Self/less, but it’s notable how passive and predictable both protagonists end up seeming in their second lives. In Self/less, it seems unintentional, but it’s the whole point of Seconds — when Hamilton has a chance to make his dreams come true, the main problem he encounters is that he doesn’t have any dreams at all. It’s like the surrealist nightmare version of Babbitt. Self/less and Seconds both play on a specifically and stereotypically male vision of recapturing youth, complete with wild parties and beautiful young women. That’s what makes Advantageous, which premiered on Netflix last month, so interesting. Despite being more explicitly sci-fi  — and much more concerned with futuristic technology and world-building — than either of those films, it’s in some senses the most realistic take on a world where you can trade in your body for a newer model. And it’s written with the understanding that where men might enjoy being young again, women aren’t allowed to get old in the first place. Gwen, the protagonist of Advantageous (played fantastically by the film's co-writer Jacqueline Kim) is a middle-aged biotech firm spokeswoman and a single mother. When the firm starts testing ways to transfer consciousness, Gwen becomes their first subject — not because she’s unhappy with herself, but because she can only keep her job by being younger and more generically beautiful. There’s nothing overtly sinister going on, but the whole thing is tinged with shades of The Stepford Wives and The Handmaid’s Tale. Unlike those stories, though, the pressure to stay young and beautiful isn't a product of retrograde male oppression — there are few men in the movie at all — but instead stems from the price of living in the upper-middle-class ecosystem, just one stumble or imperfection away from being left behind. Body-swapping stories aren't so much about living forever as they are about what we’d give up to become something better — and who gets to decide what ""better"" really means. In the end, it's just an incredibly literal metaphor for drastic change or dispossession, and that’s what makes it so flexible, even when it’s applied to less-than-perfect narratives. Writers and filmmakers will likely continue exploring it in the abstract until the metaphor becomes real technology — hopefully in its least obviously evil form.

I call them Highdog and Longdog. Think of it like a dog-video-based personality test. The video above is a mixed terrier jumping 13 feet in the air to grab a tire. This is Highdog. Highdog aspires to great things, but uses practical means to achieve them. Notice the scrabbling, haphazard climb. Highdog relies on close social ties to achieve its goals, specifically with the men who amp it up before the jump and catch it as it falls. Highdog understands the world's flaws, but works within those flaws rather than against them. At the same time, Highdog is clear-eyed about its limits, and there is a deeper sadness that comes with that knowledge.   This GIF shows a dog jumping what appears to be at least 25 feet across a sandy trench. This is Longdog. Longdog is concerned with form, achieving an almost perfect leg extension as it comes off the platform. Longdog sees speed as a platonic ideal rather than a means to an end. As such, Longdog thinks of the jump as a work of art more than a simple product of force and speed. A single leap, then sailing through the air. Longdog loves the humans around it, but there is a part of Longdog they can never truly understand. As such, Longdog is always a stranger in this life — never really wanting, never really wanted, and always a little in love with death. Now, consider yourself: are you a Highdog or a Longdog? I am probably a Longdog deep down, although I present as a Highdog professionally because I think it will impress people more. Which maybe means that by now I am a Highdog who likes to think of himself as a Longdog? Of course, we probably all share elements of Highdog and Longdog, but let's not make this any more complicated than it has to be. Here's the poll.

No, this recently-discovered Batmobile built from a 1956 Oldsmobile is the only real option for lovers of the original comics. The hand-built car is said to be the very first officially-licensed Batmobile ever made, and it's up at auction now for a starting price of $90,000. Unlike all of the other Batmobiles, it evokes the original design used in the 1940s comics: a massive center tail fin, long swooping lines, and a bat face for a front end.   According to Heritage Auctions, the Batmobile was built and designed by 23-year-old Forrest Robinson in a barn in 1960. He completed the project in 1963 after replacing the body of a 1956 Oldsmobile 88 with his own custom design. For the next three years it toured the country as an official promotional vehicle before the George Barris-customized Lincoln Futura concept from the TV show took over. The ’63 Batmobile was relegated to obscurity and spent nearly 50 years in a field before it was rediscovered and restored in 2008.

Now, Volvo might be the first company to turn Cardboard into a serious marketing tool: it's sending out Volvo-branded Cardboards to drum up hype for the upcoming launch of its redesigned XC90 SUV. The paper goggles are paired with an Android app (there's an iOS version coming soon) that takes you in and around the XC90's cockpit on a leisurely drive, accompanied to music. The experience is divided into multiple ""episodes,"" so you can see what it's like owning a Swedish truck in different environments and at different times of day — only one episode is available at launch, with more to come. The Cardboard unit itself appears to be identical to the plain brown one Google offered at I/O, just dyed black and covered in Volvo branding.

Toyota has spent much of 2014 doubling down on hydrogen, announcing that it would sell a fuel-cell car globally in 2015 (now called the Mirai) — now, Honda has announced a new hydrogen model in Japan.  Can hydrogen infrastructure scale up? Even though it looks kind of crazy, don't pay much mind to the ""concept"" label — like the Mirai's evolution, the FCV Concept previews what the production car will look like when it launches in Japan in March of 2016, followed by the US and Europe. It bears some resemblance to the FCX Clarity, Honda's last production fuel-cell car, which has seen limited availability in California. The FCV Concept and Toyota's Mirai will both again use California as a focal point — the state has long been a boon for efficient vehicles, thanks to strict emissions standards that have helped take a bite out of LA's infamous smog. Therein lies the problem for hydrogen adoption: EVs like the Tesla Model S can plug in anywhere, but fuel cells require an entirely new infrastructure to support them. Toyota had previously committed to help building that out in California, and Honda says it'll be doing the same at this week's LA Auto Show. (Toyota now says it'll be also launching the Mirai in the US Northeast with a network of 12 refueling stations there.) But absent a nationwide hydrogen plan, these cars are just limited-use commuting tools. The FCV Concept is also a generator: Jalopnik reports that Honda's Japanese announcement includes mention of a device that allows it to feed power into your house, which is handy in an emergency.

However, Toyota claims the final price for the four-door vehicle should be significantly lower when factoring in state and federal incentives that could push the price ""under $45,000"" when all is said and done. As for the technology behind this car, Toyota claims that its fuel cell stack will be refillable in about five minutes and provide a driving range of 300 miles. It's no performance beast, but that range should make the driving experience much more like a standard gas-powered vehicle rather than most current electric vehicles, which still aren't quite feasible for most long-distance drives. Of course, there are even less places to refuel a hydrogen-powered car than there are standard electric chargers — that five-minute refuel time won't be very useful if you can't find a place to fill up your car. To that end, the Mirai will first be only available in California, where a hydrogen refueling infrastructure is currently being built out. By the end of 2015, Toyota says some 20 stations will be online, with another 28 launching in 2016. Toyota also says that 2016 will see the first construction of stations on the east coast, with 12 stations spread across five states (New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Rhode Island) expected that year. Until more stations become commonplace, hydrogen-powered cars will remain a niche curiosity — but it's easy to see the attraction to such a vehicle. The Mirai (and other similar vehicles) use no gasoline and emit only water vapor in the process.

With its rapid growth comes the need for improved infrastructure, which is why China is today inaugurating a third terminal to the local Bao'an International Airport. Designed by the Italian Studio Fuksas, Terminal 3 has been shaped to look like a manta ray, ""a fish that breathes and changes its own shape, undergoes variations, [and] turns into a bird to celebrate the emotion and fantasy of a flight."" That theme of breathing and openness is carried on by a honeycomb of skylights perforating the new terminal's steel skin and a set of stylized ""trees"" that disguise the air conditioning apparatus. The hexagonal shapes and honeycomb theme are then subtly reiterated throughout the three-floor, 500,000-square-meter facility. Construction is reported to have cost 8.5 billion yuan (roughly $1.4 billion) and the first takeoff took place this morning, courtesy of local carrier Shenzhen Airlines. It hasn't all been smooth sailing for this steel-and-concrete manta ray's debut, with passengers reporting issues around miscommunication and missed flights, though such initial stumbles are common for any new airport terminal.

Competitors like Herman Miller, Humanscale, and Knoll may dispute that title, but even they would have to rank the Leap pretty close to the pinnacle of ergonomic seating design.  With such a fine pedigree, any new chair from Steelcase invites equal amounts of anticipation and scrutiny, particularly when it sets itself the ambitious task of serving a whole new generation of mobile technology users. Identifying new ways of sitting that have developed in response to personal tech — and categorizing them with such poetic titles as the strunch and the cocoon — Steelcase believes the very way we interact with chairs and our work environment has changed. Its response to this evolving workspace is the Gesture chair.  So what exactly is a struncher? It's a person adopting a ""stretched-out hunch"" position, typically induced by fatigue from prolonged sessions of working on a laptop. The smart lean's name is inspired by the way we use our smartphones, while the swipe and cocoon postures derive their monikers from tablet and e-reader use, respectively. Together with five other postures, these various modes of repose form a set of nine new poses identified by a global study conducted by Steelcase. In preparing to build the new Gesture chair, the company went out and studied the sitting habits of 2,000 people in 11 countries. John Small, Steelcase's director of design, tells me he was surprised by the sheer variety and ingenuity of the positions people got themselves into while immersed in their work. What the company concluded from its observations is that we no longer relate to the work desk the way we once did: ""You’re on your iPad, you’re on your computer, you’re not really engaged with the desk anymore."" Whereas for older generations the desk and chair remain an inseparable whole, the modern worker is far more flexible and mobile. ""Working out of the bag is a growing phenomenon,"" continues Small, noting that Steelcase's internal project for addressing the needs of mobile workers is dubbed ""follow the bag."" He then points to my laptop, precariously perched atop my backpack, which I was using as an impromptu platform. Talking to Small, you quickly become conscious of all the minuscule movements, fidgeting, and repositioning you do while working.  Personal electronics have infiltrated the professional realm, that much is uncontroversial, but Steelcase's study shows that people have also imported the informal and casual ways of working with technology along with their tablets and phones. The development of the Gesture chair was thus informed by the need to accommodate all the various new contortions that an iPad user might get in to. ""There hadn’t really been a product that addressed the way that people were working,"" says Small as he details the inadequacy of current designs to meet modern needs. So Steelcase went and did a ton of observational research and came back with a design that emphasized the need for every component to ""have some relevance to the way people are working."" The Gesture chair's arms flex out in all directions and do so independently. You can elevate or lower them, tuck them in or push them out, and they even slide back and forth automatically with your arm. It's an intriguing mix of granular adjustability and automated flexibility. Other affordances made for weirder poses include the seat itself, which is ""remarkably wide"" in John Small's words and has soft edges all around, allowing you to straddle the chair or sit sideways. Apart from facilitating the above cocoon pose, that enlarged seat also makes the Gesture more suitable for what Steelcase's design director diplomatically describes as users with a larger skeletal frame. The back is designed to cradle you ""no matter the posture"" and moves in concert with the seat to adjust to your position. Sitting down in the Gesture chair, I don't feel immediately transported into a brave new world of ergonomics. The rather austere fabric and plastic materials don't convey any sense of luxury, either, but the whole point with an ergonomic chair is what it can do for you over the course of hours in a day and years in your lifetime. To judge it on first impressions is equivalent to reviewing a song after hearing only a single note. I like the sliding arm rests that follow your movement, and Steelcase claims the Gesture has the widest angle of recline among chairs of its class, though I can't say that difference is immediately apparent. It's worth noting that Steelcase isn't the first to take on the changing habits of people at work. Knoll's Generation chair, introduced in 2009, has an elastic frame designed to fit around the non-static act of sitting and similarly acknowledges the changing face of the modern workspace. Still, it's rare to see a company so openly addressing the diminishing distinction between home and office and the way that mobile technology is helping to bring them even closer together.  By meeting me in London this past week, the Strasbourg-based John Small serves as an instructive example — and a dashing model — of the extremely mobile worker his company is seeking to attract with its new chair. His entire office moves with him in the form of a laptop, sometimes a tablet, and at other times just a phone. The full implications of the mobile tech revolution are still being explored today, with more people doing more of their work at more places than ever before. With such a radical shift toward workplace nomadism, you'd think that designing a chair for this new class of user would require a similarly unprecedented design process. Not so, says Small. It turns out that designing an iPad-friendly chair is no different from any other — you iterate, you prototype, you test, you improve, and you keep the cycle going until the goal and the final product are as close to one another as possible. As revolutionary as the iPad may have been, and as iconic as the task of designing the perfect chair is, in the end it all comes down to doing the basic things well.",0.5268466005206418,0.4731533994793582,0.2113883142132095,1046,4.9273422562141489,545,6.2733944954128438,0,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

The result is a basic cellphone that can make and receive calls, text messages, store names and numbers, and display the time. Currently at MIT's Media Lab, Mellis has put all of the plans necessary to build and customize the phone up on Github, and also uploaded the circuit board plans to custom printer OSH Park, which will print three copies of the board for around $60. As for the casing, there are detailed instructions for a simple laser-cut plywood case, but several Media Lab members have crafted their own cases in a variety of shapes and hues, using milling, laser cutting, and 3D printing. Mellis describes his DIY phone as ""a difficult but potentially do-able project"" that should cost around $200 to complete.  A complete circuit board sits between its plywood shell. The edges of the circuit board are exposed when the phone is assembled, represented as a sliver of green in a plywood sandwich. The circuit board itself is cheap, but the parts that are fixed to it are more expensive. Among the priciest are the 8-character LED display ($39.19) and 6.4mm speaker ($11.83). There are also instructions for an LCD-based variant. Despite being able to convey more information than the LED, the part is far cheaper ($9.95).

The bill was amended a day before the Michigan Senate voted and passed it almost unanimously, and Governor Snyder has until October 21st to sign it into law now that it's made it through both parts of the state's legislature. This particular bill is important in both a practical and symbolic way because Michigan (specifically Detroit) is home to the ""big three"" carmakers, but it is far from the first state in which Tesla has faced a problem like this. Earlier this year the electric car manufacturer was banned outright from selling directly to consumers in New Jersey and also made an agreement with auto dealers not to open any additional locations in Ohio. Other states, including Texas, Arizona, and Virginia already have similar laws in place, and we found out first hand in March just how contentiously some auto dealers view Tesla.

Revenue was $16.52 billion, not excluding traffic acquisition costs, a 20 percent rise over the same period in 2013. But its profit of $3.72 billion was down slightly from the same period in 2013, when it reported $3.76 billion in profit. Analysts were expecting the company to generate earnings per share of $6.53, but Google reported an EPS of $6.35. The stock was down a little, about 3 percent, based largely on that miss. The key to understanding Google's current finances is the transition happening in digital advertising from desktop to mobile. Every quarter Google has reported a rise in the number of paid clicks — people who clicked on ads — but a decline in cost-per-click — the amount they make every time you click on an ad. These metrics have been moving in opposing directions and so far have largely canceled each other out. This quarter they may have contributed to an earnings report that missed expectations, but Google continues to sport a healthy profit and double-digit revenue growth year-over-year. Investors have been hoping that YouTube's advertising business and revenue from apps sold through the Play Store would provide new sources of growth outside Google's traditional search and display ads business. Google doesn't break out the revenue generated by YouTube, but it did report 50 percent year over year growth in its ""Other"" revenue category, which counts the Play Store, hardware sales, and Google's enterprise services. Google hired nearly 3,000 people over the last three months, more than average, and also invested heavily in building out new data centers. These two costs may have contributed to the lack of profit growth, but are expected to continue. On the company's earnings call, Google's Chief Business Officer, Omid Kordestani, says that the company has been very happy with the momentum they have seen in terms of consumer adoption of its delivery service, Google Express. The service recently expanded to a number of new cities, and Kordestani says they are now charging some commissions and service fees as they experiment with monetizing the business. Kordestani, asked about payments, says the main goal is to get mass adoption from merchants, so that consumers can begin to use the technology already built into their phones. All well and good, although it seems Apple has had better luck so far convincing merchants to buy into their payments platform in a big way. Patrick Pichette, the company's chief financial officer, says that its too early to tell what the fallout will be from the changes to Ireland's tax laws, but that Google is committed to the presence its developed there.

The service is called CBS All Access and it's available for $5.99 per month. Most notably, it'll let many subscribers stream their local CBS stations — and that means they'll be able to watch the network's new shows, including hits like The Good Wife, as they air for the first time. Critically, though, NFL games are not being made available. The service will also include next-day access to streams of 15 new series and all past seasons of eight current shows, including Survivor — though one notable omission there is The Big Bang Theory, which is not currently offering prior seasons. Over 5 thousand episodes of classic shows, including Star Trek and Twin Peaks, will also be available and presented ad-free. The service can be accessed through CBS's website as well as its iOS and Android apps. 14 cities can stream live TV at launch Though All Access' biggest feature — the ability to stream live TV — will be available in a lot of locations at launch, it won't be accessible everywhere. It's launching in New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Philadelphia, Dallas, San Francisco, Boston, Detroit, Minneapolis, Miami, Denver, Sacramento, Pittsburgh, and Baltimore, and CBS plans to add more locations in the future. The launch of All Access is pretty big news for those looking to leave cable behind. Networks have been hesitant to provide live content online, leaving cord-cutters a day behind on hit new series. The availability of All Access remedies a big part of that, though the absence of NFL games still leaves a huge gap in its programming. However, The New York Times reports that CBS is in talks with the NFL with the hopes of making streaming available. Other sports content, including Masters and SEC, will be made available through All Access or other CBS apps. Other networks have offered live TV streams, but those services, such as ABC's Watch ABC app, still require that you're a cable subscriber to do it. While that's a nice way to provide convenient access to a network's content, it's of little use to those who aren't interested in subscribing to cable. Still, with a major network like CBS beginning to try out an over-the-top approach, it's likely that we'll see others follow suit in the near future. In fact, one major hurdle for cord cutters has already fallen: HBO announced yesterday that it plans to launch an online-only streaming service next year, finally allowing viewers to buy a subscription separate from a cable package. A similar service from Showtime, which is owned by CBS, should come in the ""not too distant future,"" CBS CEO Les Moonves tells the Times. CBS' All Access app also goes to show that Moonves wasn't all talk when he said that CBS could go cable-only or begin offering an online streaming service should Aereo prevail in the courts. While the launch of All Access is far less dramatic, it's evident that CBS was in fact working on an online service and that Moonves clearly isn't scared of what opening up that option might lead to for the network.",0.5063531253576093,0.49364687464239065,0.853287911006469,550,4.8472727272727276,320,5.609375,0,0,"Apps, Business, Entertainment, Tech",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

With the option to slow down or block individual sites and programs, ISPs would give you the internet equivalent of basic cable, then charge extra for ""News"" and ""Hollywood"" bundles with Digg and YouTube instead of CNN and Showtime. There’s no subtlety, but it gets the point across. So what happens when, after almost a year with no net neutrality rules, a company whose name is synonymous with premium cable jumps online? can't quote cost of standalone HBO without factoring in internet cost, which comes from the same cable co you just canceled TV service on Earlier today, HBO and its parent company Time Warner announced an internet-only subscription program, letting customers use the HBO Go streaming video app without first buying a cable or satellite package. This has been a major request for years, and HBO has openly acknowledged that many cord-cutters are sharing account passwords with friends, not heading back to the television. Since it hasn’t laid out the details of its plan, it’s possible we won’t get a real substitute for cable, just a better version of its Amazon Prime back catalog. If it’s as good as fans of Game of Thrones, Girls, or Boardwalk Empire hope, though, cable companies could be losing one of the few things — alongside ESPN and other sports channels — that keep customers from dropping TV altogether. But that traffic is still going to be running through those same companies’ internet pipes, and if Netflix hasn’t been able to get by without paying to connect to Comcast and Verizon’s networks, cable companies are going to push as hard or harder to keep making money off a defector. 'Fast lanes' can be flexible, but they make everything else a slow lane ""I think cable operators are aware that more and more content is going to move online,"" says John Bergmayer of pro-net neutrality group Public Knowledge. ""Instead of trying to stop that trend, I think cable companies would just like to find ways to control it — either by offering the online content themselves or coming up with ways to get online video services to pay them."" The most extreme version of this would be throttling a particular internet service: if you don’t pay a little extra, HBO Go slows to a crawl, and the cable-fication of the internet begins. This is, simply put, not likely. It’s far more probable that HBO will come to a Netflix-like agreement to directly connect to an ISP, or that it will partner with cable companies for a competitive advantage, like the right to offer service that doesn’t count against users’ data caps. More generally, there’s a battle going on over whether the FCC should ban internet ""fast lanes,"" in which ISPs would speed up certain sites or software for a price. While they wouldn’t be allowed to actually degrade service for anyone else, improving the internet for specific, popular products arguably makes it easier to skate by without improving the baseline network that new companies use. The more data-hungry a service is, the more noticeable a speed gap would be, so a high-profile streaming-video company that managed to get in the fast lane would have a noticeable advantage. With a strong catalog, backing from Time Warner, and existing relationships with cable operators, HBO is well placed to be the one that does it. And so far, it seems happy to be in that position. ""Every night in the United States, a big piece of the broadband capacity of the country is being used, probably, by Netflix and Youtube,"" said HBO chairman and CEO Richard Plepler when asked about net neutrality.  ""If you add a lot more programming ... there's gonna be a strain on that system,"" he continued. ""There's gonna need to be an evolution of financial support to continue to maintain the ability of the broadband infrastructure"" for digital video. ""One way or another, that's going to work out."" Reading between the lines, it’s an endorsement of deals between streaming-video companies and ISPs, whether that means a connection fee or a ""sponsored"" deal for free data. Plepler said that HBO planned to continue working with its current partners and would ""explore models with new partners,"" echoing the language ISPs use to discuss ""fast lanes."" ""If you add a lot more programming ... there's gonna be a strain on that system."" To some, fast lanes aren’t categorically bad. ""There are good reasons to think even an exclusive sponsored data deal could be good for consumers — and even for Netflix. But it really depends,"" says Berin Szoka of TechFreedom, which tends to oppose net neutrality. Exempting HBO from a data cap, for example, could free up bandwidth for other video sites. Granted, the higher video resolution goes — Netflix is already looking at 4K — the more precious each gigabyte of data becomes. ""As quality levels improve, there might come a point where refusing to allow Netflix to participate in a sponsored data program might well make it harder for Netflix to compete with other video providers,"" he says. ""But we’re certainly nowhere near there yet."" The point, for Szoka, is that the FCC shouldn’t rule out possibilities that aren’t clearly anti-consumer, as long as they don’t already fall under antitrust law. Regardless, plenty of these deals could exist even under the most stringent FCC net neutrality framework. Netflix’s negotiation with Comcast over internet backbone service, for example, doesn’t fall under its proposed purview. Time Warner and an ISP could both fairly undercut competition by offering free HBO Go to customers. Overall bandwidth costs might have to be passed on to consumers, which ideally would incentivize more efficient networks but seems as likely to jack up prices. Could the internet feel more segmented as a result? It’s possible. But as long as ISPs aren’t meddling with the actual speed of data as it flows to their customers, it’s not a net neutrality problem. Whether or not the FCC adopts meaningful net neutrality rules, as it’s promised to do this year, HBO is still a step towards a world where everything lives on the internet by default. Even if it sides with ISPs instead of Netflix, it’s no longer literally tied to traditional television. Is the internet heading the way of cable? ""I don’t know. I think today it looks like cable,"" says Matt Wood of net neutrality advocacy group Free Press. ""It sounds to me like this is probably an improvement.""",0.34028813917741296,0.659711860822587,0.1905742662927025,1114,4.9515260323159787,569,6.1933216168717049,0,0,"Business, Report",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

So Google, for example, has a Dublin office with around 2,500 employees, but most of the revenue booked in Ireland is then paid as royalties to a separate subsidiary, headquartered for tax purposes in Bermuda. According to a report in the New York Times, that loophole is going to be closed.

Netflix stock dropped 3 percent after HBO's announcement, and that makes a lot of sense after hearing Time Warner and HBO executives lay out their plans for streaming-only programming and talk about their stance on net neutrality. In both areas, the news for Netflix was not good. Consumers may be cutting the cord, but HBO isn't In its presentation to investors and analysts today, Time Warner made clear that it has no intention of joining Netflix in its fight to expand the definition of net neutrality. Executives said they see content companies paying to support the increasing strain on broadband networks as a ""natural evolution"" of net neutrality — the complete opposite of the position Netflix is pushing. It also goes against the fundamental tenets of net neutrality as we know it: having content companies foot the ISP's bills is quite literally pay-for-play. That's not surprising, of course, since the majority of Time Warner's revenue and the lion's share of its profit still come from cable TV. It's not going to sever those relationships anytime soon. So why move forward with a cable-free HBO Go? Time Warner recognized that its best path for major growth going forward was not increasing its cable customers, but feeding the enormous hunger from broadband only consumers. It couldn't afford to keep waiting for the cable companies to figure out ""TV Anywhere"" or some other solution while Netflix established a dominant position on the way we'll watch in the future. Content is king, but over the top is the power behind the throne So HBO is trying to have the best of both worlds. It sees a big upside in pursuing consumers outside the cable bundle and monetizing the 5 million people it says are already using HBO Go with someone else's password. The company said today that it anticipates the web-only HBO Go service could translate into hundreds of millions of dollars in new revenue. It believes there are currently around 10 million broadband-only homes in America. ""That is a large and growing opportunity that should no longer be left untapped. It is time to  remove all barriers to those who want HBO,"" said  Richard Plepler, HBO's chairman and CEO. ""All in,  there are 80 million homes that do not have HBO and we will use all means at our disposal to  go after them.""   But Plepler also said, ""We  will work with our current partners. And, we will explore models with new partners."" How would that look from a business perspective? Depending on how the FCC proceeds, we could soon be living in a world without any meaningful net neutrality. It wouldn't be surprising to see HBO arbitrage its relationships with the cable companies to exempt its streaming service from their data caps — or to offer a bundle where signing up for Comcast or Verizon as your ISP means you get a free year of HBO Go. ""There are 80 million homes that do not have HBO and we will use all means at our disposal to go after them."" It's not all bad news for Netflix. A cable-free HBO Go makes cutting the cord way easier for many consumers, which could help Netflix to nab new subscribers. In the very long term, the move by HBO should be most frightening to the traditional cable companies that aren't competitive broadband internet providers, as it will accelerate the transition to a world of over-the-top cord cutters that Netflix is already poised to capitalize on. With their powers combined, the pay TV landscape in the United States seems ready to shift radically, and much sooner than anyone had predicted. But in the short term, this news could hurt Netflix badly. A standalone HBO Go, potentially with hundreds of million in new revenue, would ramp up its bidding on syndicated series and films, pushing Netflix's already ballooning content costs even higher. And the ISPs just gained an invaluable ally: a major content company signaling its comfortable doing deals around net neutrality.

Presidential hopeful Rand Paul is gunning for the youth vote.

In a recent interview with Politico's Mike Allen, Paul took some time to outline his Snapchat-focused game plan for getting teenagers to vote for him.  Snapchats for Rand ""We reach thousands of kids that we might not ever have reached before,"" Paul said. ""In fact, we're probably reaching some kids who aren't yet 18, that will be 18 when the elections roll around the next time. We'll have whole classrooms sometimes do a Snapchat to us.""

Similar cybersecurity legislation has failed in Congress before under similar circumstances, most notably CISPA in 2011. It's unclear whether the White House will endorse the legislation, although it has proposed similar cybersecurity measures in the past. Crucially, all of the information shared under the new bill will be volunteered by companies: the bill establishes ground rules for sharing threat information, but doesn't require companies to use it. There are also provisions against retaliatory hacking, introduced out of concern that well-meaning targets might inflict further damage in reaction to an attack. Still, many are still worried about the implications of the bill, particularly Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR), the sole member of the intelligence committee to vote against the bill.

The 71-year-old heir to one of New York's wealthiest real estate families was arrested in New Orleans yesterday and is being extradited to Los Angeles on a first-degree murder warrant. Durst is the subject of a six-part HBO documentary exploring the man's life and his connections to three separate murder mysteries. The finale airs tonight. Officials have yet to announce details of the arrest, but Durst's attorney tells The New York Times that it's tied to the 2000 murder of Durst's friend and confidant Susan Berman in Los Angeles. Houston ABC affiliate KTRK reports that Durst's lawyer will not fight extradition, but he will mount a defense in Los Angeles. The New York Times' anonymous law enforcement sources say that FBI agents were involved in the arrest in New Orleans.   It's not yet known if the arrest is directly tied to the HBO documentary The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst. The documentary centers around 25 hours of exclusive interviews Durst granted to director Andrew Jarecki after the release of All Good Things, a film starring Ryan Gosling that centered on Durst's life. The enigmatic man sought to offer his side of the story, but the documentary may have reignited interest in his suspected murders. The New York Times reported last week that law enforcement officials were interviewing witnesses in the Berman case. In one interview, The Jinx highlights a newly-discovered note hand-written by Durst before Berman's death. Its block-lettering and a misspelling appears to match an anonymous letter later sent to police informing them of a body in Berman's home. She was found dead with a gunshot wound to the head in 2000. At the time, detectives were seeking to interview her regarding the disappearance of Durst's wife in 1982. In a separate 2001 incident, Durst admitted to killing and dismembering his neighbor in Galveston, Texas, but he pled self-defense.

Recently, a cultural center in Havana began rolling out access to free, public Wi-Fi — the first of its kind in Cuba. The country currently prioritizes its limited bandwidth for schools and businesses, but this is the first time the Cuban government has allowed a free, public Wi-Fi hub, AP reports.  It's slow, but significant The cultural center is run by the Cuban visual artist Kcho, who has ties to the state government. Last month, Fidel Castro appeared at the public opening of the cultural center, AP reports. The center's free Wi-Fi comes from Kcho's personal, government-authorized internet connection, which runs at a speed of 2 Mbps. Although that may sound pretty slow to internet users in other parts of the world — globally, average internet speeds are around 3.9 Mbps — it's a huge boon for Cuba, where much of the population still has no internet access at all. Last month, the state-run telecom provider ETECSA announced plans to begin offering Wi-Fi service in the country's second largest city, Santiago de Cuba. But pay-to-play Wi-Fi, which reportedly runs for around $4.50 per hour, can be exorbitantly costly for Cuban citizens making just $20 a month. The AP estimates Kcho is likely paying around $900 a month for his connection. Kcho told the AP that because dozens of users are connecting to the center's Wi-Fi at any given time, the signal strength is often weak. But in a place where citizens typically need government approval to install a router, a diluted Wi-Fi connection is better than none at all. ""It is expensive, but the benefit is tremendous,"" Kcho told the AP. ""I have something that is great and powerful.

For five days, web traffic from Texas to certain addresses in the UK has been routed through Ukrainian and Russian telecoms, taking a detour thousands of miles out of the way. Network traffic often takes a circuitous route as a result of network congestion or interconnection difficulties, but neither one would be enough to account for these routes. Instead, this was the result of a bad route announced by Ukraine's Vega telecom, inserting itself in between. ""At this point, I have to believe this was an innocent mistake by Vega,"" said Dyn's Doug Madory, who first discovered the redirection, ""but it's concerning nonetheless."" ""At this point, I have to believe this was an innocent mistake."" This phenomenon is known as ""route hijacking,"" and it's a common security concern for network engineers and security researchers alike. It's particularly disconcerting because of the sensitive nature of many of the sites involved. Among the dozens of sites involved was the UK's Atomic Weapons Establishment, which is tasked with managing and delivering the UK's nuclear warheads, as well as the UK's official mail service, the Royal Mail. US defense contractor Lockheed Martin was also running a VPN connection that was caught up in the redirection. VPN traffic would have been encrypted, as well as almost all email traffic, but anyone listening in on email traffic would have been able to read the IP addresses of the parties involved. Even worse, any site serving data over unencrypted HTTP would have been entirely in the clear, and potentially exposed to injection attacks by a malicious third party with access to an intermediate network. (Both AWE and Royal Mail serve their sites over unencrypted HTTP.) Because of the public nature of the routing table, it's easy to see exactly when and how the route hijacking occurred, but why is still a mystery, and we can't say for sure whether any data was altered in transit. It's still likely that the redirection was simply an innocent error, but it underscores the insecure nature of the global routing system. While much of the web has grown more wary of digital attack, routing is still based on trust, with networks freely announcing routes and friendly telecoms adopting them as a matter of habit. As a result, inefficient and potentially insecure routes like this one can linger for days without being corrected, without the parties involved ever being aware of them.

(Aside: Is that nickel plate dads or nickel-plated ads?) Of course, these URLs have now been compromised, which means the NSA has no use for them. That does raise the possibility that the government could sell the domains off like the other unused gear it accrues.

Abrams, producer Kathleen Kennedy, and writer Lawrence Kasdan are all scheduled to attend. The big question is who the promised ""special guests"" are going to be, and what they'll reveal. While the bulk of the new cast showed up earlier this year at Star Wars Celebration, there's still a number of actors that would get the Hall H crowd excited. Chief among them, of course, is Han Solo himself, Harrison Ford. Other actors that haven't appeared yet to talk to the faithful are Adam Driver (who plays the villainous — we think? — Kylo Ren), Andy Serkis (who plays someone named Supreme Leader Snoke), Game of Thrones' Gwendoline Christie (the chrometrooper Captain Phasma), and Ex Machina's Domhnall Gleeson, whose name hasn't even been released yet. And while early indications are that Abrams won't be showing off new footage or trailers, there's plenty of other Star Wars news to discuss. The most significant recent development has been the news that Phil Lord and Christopher Miller (The Lego Movie) will be directing a film about a young Han Solo. A title reveal for that movie wouldn't be out of the question, particularly if Ford is present, nor would it be bad timing for Lucasfilm to bring out Gareth Edwards to discuss the Star Wars Anthology film Rogue One. A teaser for Rogue One was shown off during Star Wars Celebration, and a Comic-Con replay would be a great way to get audiences excited not just for what's coming this December, but for what's ahead as well.

By now, it’s taken for granted on the internet that Superman Lives, the aborted Superman film of the late ‘90s, would have been an abject failure. It looks like it could have been worse than Batman & Robin. Just one look at one of the scant images from the film’s pre-production — most notably a long-haired Nicolas Cage in a terrible Superman costume — is all most comic lovers need to know that Lives was better off dead. But maybe fans just don’t know the potential it had? The Death of Superman Lives: What Happened?, directed by Space Ghost: Coast to Coast alum Jon Schnepp, dives deep into the mythology surrounding the movie, and tries to get to the bottom of the film’s infamous cancellation. It makes the bold case that the film could have been good. That it could have been big. And not only that — when I spoke to Schnepp and producer Holly Payne off the convention floor at Comic-Con, it’s clear they believe Superman Lives could have changed the course of superhero movies as we know them.  ""If Nicolas Cage had been Superman back in 1998, he would have probably avoided the whole meme craze that happened,"" said Payne, referring to how much the internet loves to stick his Mad Hatter-esque mug on everything. ""His whole career would have changed entirely from that point on."" ""Nicolas Cage's whole career would have changed."" ""'Once Nicolas Cage took over as Superman, I really started to love that character,'"" said Schnepp, imagining an alternate present in which Cage was even more successful and beloved than Robert Downey, Jr. ""‘He became more human to me. He wasn’t like a weird god. I could empathize with his character.’ I’m dead serious! That’s what would’ve happened."" In the mid-‘90s, nearly 10 years since the release of Superman IV: The Quest for Peace, Warner Bros. set out to reboot the Superman film series, but in the most ambitious, bombastic way possible. Rather than build on the foundation built by Richard Donner and Christopher Reeve, Warner wanted to turn the mythology on its head. Popular comic nerd Kevin Smith penned the screenplay, based on the groundbreaking Death of Superman comic series. Later, they hired Nicolas Cage (still on a hot streak from big blockbusters like The Rock and Con Air) to star as the Man of Steel, and director Tim Burton at the peak of his ‘90s powers. But somewhere along the way, things seemingly went horribly, hilariously wrong, full of shiny neon costumes, polar bears, and giant spiders. Subsequent rewrites from Wesley Strick and Nightcrawler director Dan Gilroy didn’t help. Eventually, the project was shelved entirely. Bad costume tests and kooky plot points aside, a lot of those elements were included by design. According to Payne and Schnepp, who both showed a deep appreciation for comics lore, the decisions Tim Burton made were meant to illustrate how alien Superman is and how cut off he ultimately felt from humanity. The spiders and bears still seem silly, but the movie also had Brainiac and Doomsday, two of Superman’s finest villains. As for the shiny costume, it was apparently a living suit that evolved as Clark’s concept of his humanity evolved. And the final costume was actually much closer to what Henry Cavill wears in the new DC Cinematic Universe. In the end, this would have been a movie steeped in comics canon, but also committed to deconstructing what the idea of Superman means.   ""Dealing with that outsider, alien feeling is exactly what the character Superman needs in order for people like us to actually empathize with him,"" explained Schnepp. ""You’re not gonna empathize with a guy floating around with god-like powers. You’re gonna empathize with somebody who’s like, ‘How am I even an alien? I don’t know how to deal with this.’"" ""It would have changed modern superhero films."" All this would have been buttressed by Nicolas Cage, already a big comic book fan and a respected, bankable actor who also deeply understood the Superman mythology. Payne explained that in many ways, his casting mirrored that of Michael Keaton in Burton’s Batman. ""There’s a clip in the [What Happened?],"" said Payne, ""where Nicolas Cage says, ‘I was gonna turn that character upside-down,’ and that’s exactly what he would have done. And not in a bad way, but in a way that nobody would have ever seen before."" But after Superman Lives was shelved, Cage’s career started to drop off precipitously, something Payne thinks was a shame. ""I don’t want to call people idiots, but I will call people uninformed about Nicolas Cage,"" she said. Before [National Treasure] when he got cast, [he did] Raising Arizona, Wild At Heart, [and] Adaptation. He’s an actor who takes chances, and he’s not afraid."" There’s no way to know to know if Superman Lives would have been a good movie. The film described in the documentary doesn’t sound dumb — it just sounds almost too heady to work as a commercial blockbuster. Maybe it would have failed because of its outsized ambition. But Schnepp and Payne manage to make a compelling case for why scrapping it was a colossal missed opportunity for Warner Bros. Blade was the only comic book superhero movie of 1998, and its success laid the groundwork for hits like X-Men. But imagine if Superman Lives succeeded: would Marvel be the same cinematic juggernaut it is today? ""I think it would have changed the modern superhero films,"" said Schnepp. ""This film would have spawned a series of Superman sequels. Probably Justice League would have happened in 2003 or ‘04. And I’d be making The Death of Iron Man: What Happened?""",0.2563868412359744,0.7436131587640256,0.1599070001846935,968,4.9245867768595044,527,5.9487666034155602,0,2,"Comic-Con, Culture, Entertainment, Film, Report",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Learn more. In the weeks after its release, Windows 10 users have noticed something strange — it's always phoning home. Last week, an Ars Technica investigation found Windows computers sending data back to Microsoft servers even after services like Cortana and OneDrive had been disabled, in one case even sending back a message as soon as users hit the Start button. It's a telling change for Microsoft — the last major tech company built on self-contained software — and it’s set off a string of related worries. If any Microsoft users had been scared off by data collection from Google and Apple, they now have nowhere to turn. Reached by Ars Technica, the company was quick to defend itself, saying, ""No query or search usage data is sent to Microsoft, in accordance with the customer's chosen privacy settings."" Most of the data is anonymized usage logging, not inherently a privacy concern, but the fact remains: using Windows 10 requires constant access to Microsoft's remote servers, and that access goes both ways. This isn't an option anymore; it's the default In 2015, this is simply how computing works. Consumers expect smart recommendations and continually improving services. We expect computers — all computers — to be able to answer any question at any time. In return, companies get constant access to your computer for data collection, automatic updates, and offboard processing. This isn't an option anymore; it's the default. And anyone who doesn't like the deal is going to have a very hard time using today's computers.  Mobile tech works this way out of necessity — there simply isn't the processing power to take on more complex tasks — and over the last five years, even more powerful computers have followed that model. It's essentially the premise of all Google's software efforts. Most Chromebooks are constantly feeding data back to Google servers, even though it happens more often through Drive or Search services than the OS itself. If the services are going to improve, engineers need to know what's working and what isn't — and since the services themselves are all free, some level of data-targeted advertising is inevitable. Companies go back and forth on how much to collect and how much to anonymize, but the overall choices have turned out very much the same. Apple ran into its own version of this problem when Yosemite launched last year: the revamped Spotlight Search function fed queries back to Apple Headquarters. But if Spotlight is going to handle web-facing queries like ""restaurants near me,"" what else could it do? For a long time, Microsoft was the exception to this rule. The company has rolled out lots of cloud services, but they've been discrete offerings, rarely baked into the OS itself, in part because the new approach cut against Microsoft's traditional strengths. That logic changed with Windows 10 because it had to. If Microsoft is going to steal users back from Apple and Google, it needs to match services like Siri and Google Now, which means plugging into the cloud at the deepest possible level. But while software has changed, the world has been changing around it. Corporate clouds aren't as secure as they once were, and we've seen them compromised by government spies and Redditors alike. Last year, Microsoft chased down an in-house leaker by peeking into a private blogger's Hotmail account, offering profuse apologies after the fact. But for anyone who wants to exercise stronger control over their own email, their own hardware, their own data, it's hard to know where to turn. Leaving your computer in a company's hands is quite literally the only option.

We're totally blowing up our site: we've given our reporters and editors the entire week to play with new tools and experiment with new storytelling ideas, while members of our amazing product team have gathered in New York to help build all sorts of interesting new things. Learn more. Here's a weird thought experiment I've been noodling on for the past couple of weeks. When Apple announces the next iPhone next month, what are the prices that it's going to flash on screen? Since last September, we've experienced a kind of revolution in wireless plans here in the US. Following T-Mobile, the big carriers have essentially jettisoned contracts and contract pricing for most of their new customers (though you can find them if you know where to look). So Apple probably can't put up that traditional $199 on-contract starting price up on the big screen. Instead, it may have to put up the full price, or maybe the cost of the full price divided by 24. Or maybe something else entirely. We finally know how much phones really cost Our whole concept of how much an iPhone — or any phone — costs is getting blown up here in the US. Or better said: it's getting normalized, so that we know the actual cost of a phone instead of having it hidden in the depths of monthly service plans. Knowing that price would be great, but carriers can't seem to help themselves when it comes to creating complicated and opaque payment plans. The latest come from Sprint and T-Mobile, who want you to buy an iPhone right now even though they know, and you know, and they know that you know that a new one is right around the corner. So they're offering you the chance to upgrade a mere month or two after you buy an iPhone. These shenanigans apply to more than just the iPhone, of course, but right now it's at the epicenter of these leasing and early-upgrade options. And so far as we can tell, most of these plans end up being bad deals unless you're so eager to not have to resell your old phone that you're willing to pay extra for the privilege. It's the car leasing model on a smaller (or maybe bigger) scale, with all the consumer confusion and head games that go with it. So here, forthwith, is a guide to buying an iPhone from a major US carrier. We didn't follow every path down to the final cost — in part because the final cost with many of these plans depends on your credit and the phase of the Moon when you buy it.

Every five years, the United States government updates a set of Dietary Guidelines intended to help its citizens make healthier food choices. These guidelines also help inform how companies package and market their products. The 2015 edition, as noted by The Washington Post, will mark perhaps the biggest change since the original 1977 advice by dropping the warning about cholesterol consumption. One of the six core goals since the 1970s has been to limit the intake of cholesterol to less than 300mg per day, however the present Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee (DGAC) does not believe that cholesterol consumption is something we need to be worried about. Foods high in cholesterol — such as eggs, offal, and seafood — have long been considered contributors to the risk of heart disease, however research seeking to establish any causative link between them and undesirable health outcomes has been equivocal. In the absence of a proper scientific consensus and given that the human body produces a lot more cholesterol than it takes in via the diet, the DGAC has decided that ""cholesterol is not considered a nutrient of concern for overconsumption."" That's not to say that cholesterol is completely innocuous, and having it clog up your arteries is still a threat to heart health, but the amount of it that you consume is no longer thought to be important enough to restrict. Nobody's really sure about what the healthiest diet is; or if such a thing exists The DGAC is more concerned about the chronic under-consumption of good nutrients, noting that Vitamin D, Vitamin E, potassium, calcium, and fiber are under-consumed across the entire US population. Placing a greater emphasis on pushing people toward healthy choices like nutrient-dense vegetables and away from the villainous duo of sugar and sodium (which are universally over-consumed) is set to be the big focus for the 2015 Dietary Guidelines. The change in thinking about cholesterol consumption is just part of an evolving body of opinion about the healthiest diet choices. Just this week, a new study of the data available in 1977 concluded that the original Dietary Guidelines were based on inadequate evidence and should never have been issued. The report, authored by an international team of academics led by Zoe Harcombe, was critical of the advice against the consumption of fat, which could, with time, be another area where the DGAC seeks to modify its recommendations. For now, the big change is the removal of the cholesterol warning, which the US departments of Agriculture and Health and Human Services are expected to endorse in the final publication of the 2015 Dietary Guidelines later this year.

Even though the study took place in mice, the finding is pretty significant; it's the first time researchers have shown that a tweaked version of insulin can regulate itself in a living animal. If the finding translates to humans, it could lower the amount of insulin injections required by people with diabetes and prevent some of the dangerous complications that injecting too much insulin can cause. ""Right now, all of the insulin that a patient takes is ‘dumb.'"" Over 29 million people in the US suffer from some form diabetes, a condition in which people either lack the insulin necessary to regulate blood sugar, produce too little insulin, or make  ineffective insulin. People with diabetes regulate their blood sugar levels by injecting insulin, which allows the sugar in the blood to be absorbed into skeletal muscles and fat tissues. But this means continuous monitoring of blood sugar levels, and adherence to a specific diet. And unfortunately, even when those guidelines are followed precisely, patients can still experience serious complications. ""Right now, all of the insulin that a patient takes is ‘dumb,’ in a way,"" says Daniel Anderson, a molecular geneticist at the Harvard–MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology and a co-author of the study. The molecules do their job whether blood sugar is high or low. That means that insulin-injecting patients run the risk of hypoglycemia if their blood sugar is low when the insulin is in their system — and that means serious consequences, like passing out, seizures, and rapid heartbeats. Almost 100,000 people visit the ER for insulin-related hypoglycemia yearly. ""Insulin is a very important drug for diabetics, but it’s also fickle in  some ways,"" says Anderson. It works great in healthy people because the pancreas  can regulate sugar levels. ""But for patents that are sick, it’s very  hard to get the right amount."" That’s why creating a synthetic form of insulin that’s  smarter than what humans produce naturally would be such a huge  breakthrough. Doing that would ""get us one step closer to having insulin  that behaves the way it’s supposed to in the body with a normal,  healthy pancreas."" it restored normal blood glucose levels more quickly than regular insulin To do this, Anderson and his team chemically modified insulin by introducing an acid into the molecule. That modification helps insulin bind to sugar in the blood stream — something normal insulin doesn’t do — and regulate the presence of sugar in a diabetic mouse’s blood. ""We don’t full understand how these things work,"" Anderson says, but the basic idea is to have insulin that can affect the patient depending on how much sugar is present around it. Binding to sugar in the bloodstream seems to help the insulin work with a lower likelihood of hypoglycemia, he says. Despite not completely understanding how the modified insulin works, the researchers were able to make molecules that can restore normal blood glucose levels in mice who had been given a ""simulated meal"" — an injection of glucose — more quickly than regular insulin or a long-acting form of insulin, both commonly used by people with diabetes. The best performing lab-made insulin derivative was able to respond to multiple glucose injections over a 13-hour period. it's not perfect The study was only done on mice, so it will take quite a while before a modified form of insulin makes it to market, Anderson says. ""It’s all speculation, but you could envision a [human] clinical trial in three or four years, assuming a bunch of other things work out,"" he says. ""And obviously the clinical approval process is a big long thing,"" so a modified form wouldn’t be available for consumers for another few years after that. In the meantime, the researchers plan to make the modified insulin more effective. Right now it performs better than conventional forms, Anderson says, but it’s not perfect. ""We would like to make it better, so that if a patient got 10 times more insulin [than they need], they wouldn't get a hypoglycemic response."" They also have to keep studying it in mice to make sure it’s safe before moving onto humans. ""That said, it's a very interesting molecule,"" he says, that ""diabetes nerds"" will appreciate.",0.7596085867297182,0.2403914132702818,0.1555270640242474,749,5.0453938584779703,388,6.1932989690721651,0,0,"Science, Report",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

We've also seen some stunning pictures of the rover itself, like the ones of the damage it's sustained, or its many infamous selfies. But a new photo of Curiosity was released last week that offered, for many, an unfamiliar view of the interplanetary robot. It was taken from over 150 miles above the surface of Mars by a camera on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter called HiRISE (High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment). HiRISE is just one of six scientific instruments on the orbiter, all of which have been very busy since entering Mars' orbit in 2006. The camera alone has helped scientists map out ancient lakes, make geological observations, and take beautiful images of the planet's surface. The images even helped us find the UK's Beagle 2 lander, a long lost spacecraft, which was thought to have crash-landed in 2003. The new image of the rover is really just the latest of many taken by the orbiter's camera as it followed Curiosity's journey. The HiRISE team has been tracking Curiosity's movements ever since the SUV-sized rover made its daring descent to the red planet in August of 2012. Even from a great distance, it's captured everything from the rover's landing to its first few drives and beyond, watching over it like a big robotic sibling in the sky. Curiosity was captured by the orbiter's HiRISE camera for the first time before it even landed. When this image was taken, the rover still had one minute left in the ""seven minutes of terror,"" a colloquial term used by NASA to describe the harrowing landing process. Days later, Curiosity was spotted at the Bradbury landing site in Gale Crater. The area around it was darkened by the blast of the rover's descent stage. This image is actually just a section of a massive mosaic made by the HiRISE team at the University of Arizona that shows the surface around Curiosity's landing site.  The HiRISE camera helped tell the story of how well the complicated landing plan was executed. Released weeks after it landed, this image shows where the rover's heat shield, descent stage, parachute, and various debris came to rest. Just a month after the rover landed, the orbiter captured its metaphorical first steps. The rover team drove Curiosity forward about eight feet, rotated it 120 degrees, and then drove it about 15 feet in reverse. Since then, Curiosity has traversed more than five miles of Martian terrain. The images from the HiRISE camera are used to map out Curiosity's travels. This one details the two-month route to the rover's initial science destination, where it drilled into Martian soil for the first time.  Two months after Curiosity's landing the HiRISE team released some 3D stereo anaglyph images, which are viewable with traditional red/blue glasses. This GIF shows Curiosity's descent stage and parachute. It was is made from HiRISE images taken over the span of five months, and shows how the parachute's position has changed multiple times because of the Martian wind. After 11 months on Mars, Curiosity can be seen almost a mile from the Bradbury landing site.  Curiosity has traveled across some rough terrain, as is evidenced in this image from early 2014. In fact, the terrain was so troublesome at times that many of its wheels were heavily damaged, so the team back on Earth planned different routes in order to preserve them. In this image the rover can be seen in the lower left corner, and you can trace its tracks all the way to the top right.  Some of the mission's most important science has been done here at ""the Kimberley"" location. Careful navigation through the multi-layered area of the Martian surface resulted in a number of twists and turns, evidenced by the donuts left in the tracks made by the SUV-sized rover. Curiosity was spotted crossing the edge of its ""landing ellipse"" almost two years into its journey. The ellipse is the four mile by 12 mile area in which the rover was projected to land. It faces more dangerous terrain outside of the ellipse as it heads toward Mars' Mount Sharp.  Curiosity is currently exploring the diverse ""Pahrump Hills"" area of Gale Crater. In its time here the rover has found evidence of organic matter and has also provided team scientists with observations that indicate Gale Crater was once a massive lake.",0.6110278071059212,0.3889721928940788,0.8398107775595012,748,4.8516042780748663,366,5.9071038251366117,0,24,"Science, Photo Essay",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The white cloth holdall — known as a McDivitt Purse to the Apollo astronauts — was originally scheduled to be left behind in the Eagle lander, but was taken home by the first man to walk on the Moon, Neil Armstrong. Mission transcripts show Armstrong referring to the bag as ""a bunch of trash that we want to take back"" (this sort of impromptu souvenir taking was common among astronauts), while museum curators have described the artifacts as having ""priceless historical value."" ""Priceless Historical Value."" The bag was apparently left undisturbed in one of Armstrong’s closets for decades until his widow, Carol Armstrong, discovered it and brought it to the attention of Allan Needell, a curator at the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum. ""Needless to say, for a curator of a collection of space artifacts, it is hard to imagine anything more exciting,"" writes Needell in a blog post for the Smithsonian. ""As far as we know, Neil has never discussed the existence of these items and no one else has seen them in the 45 years since he returned from the Moon."" Needell and his team were first told about the bag some weeks after Armstrong's death in August 2012, and have spent the years since documenting its contents; poring over mission transcripts and photographs to confirm how and when the items were used. Of the various odds and ends within the bag — including a mirror, an emergency wrench, netting, brackets, and a power cable — Needell says the two most exciting items are a 16mm camera used to record the astronauts on the Moon and a waist tether designed to be used in case of an emergency spacewalk. The camera was mounted in the window of the Eagle for the mission's duration, while the waist tether was used by Armstrong to fashion a makeshift hammock during the astronauts' seven-hour rest period before takeoff from the Moon's surface. These objects help us understand the Moon landings as real missions performed by real people It's hard to say exactly what makes objects like this so exciting (beyond the obvious fact that they went to the Moon and back), but it's perhaps something to do with their sheer ordinariness. Looking through the detailed, forensic photographs of the items taken by the Smithsonian's curators you can see evidence of wear and tear; scratches and flecks of paint that prove that these items aren't just mystical artifacts but pieces of real equipment that did small, necessary jobs to help land humanity on the Moon. As Needell himself says, the find ""helps us to appreciate that these accomplishments are not just books or movies but involve real people and real things.""

This has been the official advice from the United States since 1977 and was echoed by the United Kingdom in 1983, but a new study published today questions the scientific validity of both sets of fat-restricting advice.  ""Government dietary fat recommendations were untested in any trial prior to being introduced."" An international team of health scientists has completed a systematic study of the evidence available back in the 1970s and '80s and concluded that a relationship of causation between fat consumption and coronary heart disease was never established. The researchers found just six studies that fit the criteria to be considered proper randomized controlled trials, all limited to male subjects and most addressing the proportion of fat in the diet only indirectly. ""Government dietary fat recommendations were untested in any trial prior to being introduced,"" writes Zoe Harcombe of the University of the West of Scotland, lead author of the study. Despite this, ""to date, no analysis of the evidence base for these recommendations has been undertaken,"" which is what prompted Harcombe and her team to conduct their investigation. From among the data on various diet types that was available, there were no differences in the number of deaths from all causes, and no statistically significant changes in death from cardiovascular disease. Eating less fat was not shown to improve a person's heart health, even where changes in diet led to a reduction in blood cholesterol levels. ""It seems incomprehensible that dietary advice was introduced for 220 million Americans and 56 million UK citizens, given the contrary results from a small number of unhealthy men,"" comments Harcombe. Eating less fat was not shown to improve a person's heart health At the time of issuing the original 1977 Dietary Goals for the United States, better known as the McGovern report, the Senate Committee's lead nutritionist, Dr. Hegsted of Harvard University, admitted that the evidence base was for the advice was somewhat lacking. ""There will undoubtedly be many people who will say we have not … demonstrated that the dietary modifications we recommend will yield the dividend expected,"" remarked Hegsted. But his counterargument was that there was more to gain from switching to the recommended diet than there was to lose. Beyond reducing fat intake, the Dietary Goals also urged a reduction in the consumption of salt and sugar, whose deleterious health effects have been far better established.  Though they haven't materially changed since their introduction, the low-fat dietary guidelines have been undermined by subsequent research that has indicated that low-carbohydrate diets are more effective at promoting better health than low-fat ones. The longstanding advice to increase the consumption of carbohydrates as a way to offset the reduction in fat may now be proving Dr. Hegsted's assertion wrong: there could well be downsides to embracing the McGovern report's full recommendations. The conclusion of the Harcombe study is stark and unequivocal: ""The present review concludes that dietary advice not merely needs review; it should not have been introduced."" It's remarkable that it's taken this long for a detailed analysis of the McGovern Committee's evidence to have been conducted, given that it was questioned right from the beginning. Without the necessary scientific rigour at the time or later evidence to support the original guidelines, the McGovern Committee's efforts now appear well intentioned but ultimately misguided.",0.4976205084854608,0.5023794915145392,0.8428311199615729,590,5.3949152542372882,315,6.6222222222222218,0,0,"Policy & Law, Science, US & World, Report",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

But only three of the resulting 78 publications monitored in today's report mentioned the misconduct uncovered during inspections. And no corrections, retractions, or other comments were added after publication. The author of today's report blames ""regulatory capture"" for the lapse, or a type of corruption where a public agency protects the interests of the groups it's meant to regulate rather than the interests of the public at large. the misconduct isn't surprising; the fda's silence is Protocol violations — where researchers didn't follow their stated methodology — were most common, occurring in three-quarters of the trials, according to today's report in JAMA Internal Medicine. And many patients weren't properly informed before they consented to be studied, or the trials they were in lacked oversight in more than half of the research. Two-thirds of the trials had inadequate or wrong record-keeping. Also common: falsification or the submission of false information, which occurred in 39 percent of trials. In a quarter of the trials, there were problems with reporting adverse events — that is, serious side health concerns that may arise in either the test or control groups. The misconduct itself isn't so surprising, writes study author Charles Seife, who is also a journalism professor at New York University. Here's what he says is surprising, though: When the FDA finds scientific fraud or misconduct, the agency doesn’t  notify the public, the medical establishment, or even the scientific  community that the results of a medical experiment are not to be  trusted. On the contrary. For more than a decade, the FDA has shown a  pattern of burying the details of misconduct. As a result, nobody ever  finds out which data is bogus, which experiments are tainted, and which  drugs might be on the market under false pretenses. The FDA has  repeatedly hidden evidence of scientific fraud not just from the public,  but also from its most trusted scientific advisers, even as they were  deciding whether or not a new drug should be allowed on the market. Even  a congressional panel investigating a case of fraud regarding a  dangerous drug couldn't get forthright answers. For an agency devoted to  protecting the public from bogus medical science, the FDA seems to be  spending an awful lot of effort protecting the perpetrators of bogus  science from the public. In one case, falsified data led to a patient's deathIn at least one case, falsified data led to a patient's death, in a trial that compared chemotherapy regimens. In another trial, describing a stem cell treatment in 26 patients, all patients were described as having improved, even though one later had to have a foot amputated two weeks after being treated. And in yet another case, the FDA considered the entire clinical trial unreliable — which wasn't noted in the publication. What that means is that patients and doctors are left uninformed by the agency that's meant to protect them. Both Seife's article and its accompanying editorial suggest the FDA's reports of inspection should be attached to the Clinicaltrials.gov database, so anyone can find them. The FDA told Reuters that it's ""committed to increasing the  transparency of compliance and enforcement activities with the goal of  enhancing the public’s understanding of the FDA’s decisions, promoting  the accountability of the FDA, and fostering an understanding among  regulated industry about the need for consistently safe and high-quality  products."" Seife despairs at the FDA, in his piece for Slate, which is worth reading in full: The sworn purpose of the FDA is to protect the public health, to assure  us that all the drugs on the market are proven safe and effective by  reputable scientific trials. Yet, over and over again, the agency has  proven itself willing to keep scientists, doctors, and the public in the  dark about incidents when those scientific trials turn out to be less  than reputable. It does so not only by passive silence, but by active  deception. And despite being called out numerous times over the years  for its bad behavior, including from some very pissed-off members of  Congress, the agency is stubbornly resistant to change. It’s a sign that  the FDA is deeply captured,  drawn firmly into the orbit of the pharmaceutical industry that it’s  supposed to regulate.

They were there to hear some drums. The kit had been set up in the far back corner, adjacent to the disco ball. Each drum — snare, bass, two toms, hi-hat, ride — had a small, glowing piece of plastic clamped onto its rim, and each of those clamps was hooked up to a laptop nearby. Otherwise, it seemed like any normal drum set. Then the show began, and Kiran Gandhi, a drummer who's toured with M.I.A. (and just graduated from Harvard Business School), started to play. Too many sounds — way too many sounds — began coming out of those drums. The snare crashed with a digital fizz, the tom sounded like an 808, the bass drum like a mallet bonging on the side of a grand piano. It sounded like a free jazz solo version of the beat behind a studio-produced dance banger, and it looked like magic. This was the Kickstarter launch party for a new drum system called Sensory Percussion, created by a drummer and programmer named Tlacael Esparza who, along with his brother Tenoch, founded a company called Sunhouse to develop this technology. ""We’re trying to bring back the intuitive physicality of music making,"" Tlacael said, ""but bring those skills to electronic music."" In other words, he wants to make it so that a drummer hitting real drums can play any kind of electronic beat out there, no matter how complicated, just with the sticks in their hands. Tlacael came up with the idea when he found himself confronted with one very particular challenge: ""There's this Nicolas Jaar song called 'Why Didn’t You Save Me' that has this just amazing drum part,"" Tlacael said, ""and when I heard it I thought: I want to do that."" But he knew it was impossible with the existing technology. Jaar is a producer and a DJ, and that drum part was the product of complex sampling, pitch shifting, and other radical changes in the basic sounds being played, none of which a drummer can do while playing, sticks in hand. ""All of that desire fed into building this,"" Tlacael said, ""to just allow for that kind of control over sound."" The gap between the beats coming out of studios and the physical capability of drummers has been growing for decades. Drummers today are stuck with technology that doesn’t match their skills: fiddling with knobs and laptops and sample pads doesn’t draw on any of their training as real drummers. Meanwhile, electronic drumkits lack the nuanced sound of real drums. They are essentially buttons that trigger preset sounds. They’ll play louder or softer depending on how hard you hit them, but that’s the limit of their expressivity. ""I love electronic music, but playing a keyboard or a pad to make a drum beat does not make any sense to me,"" said Kiran Gandhi, who’s been beta testing Sensory Percussion since she encountered it at Sunhouse’s demo studio during South By Southwest this spring. ""To able to sit down and write a beat using my drum set is revolutionary."" Unlike electronic drums, Sensory Percussion picks up on the actual sound coming out of acoustic drums, and then uses that to form its digital output. It allows drummers to capture all the subtleties that analog drums can produce while playing digital music. Here’s how it works: those glowing clamps contain two small microphones that pick up the analog audio signal from the drums, and the Sensory Percussion software translates the sound into a manipulable digital signal in real time. After a brief training session in which you teach the program what different parts of your drum sound like when played, the program's audio processing and machine learning algorithms can tell where and how you’re is hitting the drum, whether that's in the middle of the drum head, the edge, or somewhere in between, or if you’re hitting the rim with the tip of the stick or the middle of the shaft — all told, it can separate the sound coming out of the drum into eight separate zones. You can then assign different samples or effects to each zone, and blend between them (by physically playing somewhere between the center of those zones) with as much nuance as the analog acoustics of the drum allow. This is easier to grok when you see it in action, but that process transforms physical drums into virtual spaces, capable of playing effects and sounds on the fly. You could make one zone control reverb, another play a drum sample, and the rest play sounds you recorded around your house, all on one drum. Technically, the sensors can process any sound input as a ""zone,"" so you could tell the program to use your laptop’s built-in mic as the sensor input, and play your desk like a drum kit. The program can also record all the information on where you’ve hit the drum during a session, and you can then swap out the samples and effects assigned to each zone after the fact, keeping the same underlying performance intact while changing the sound completely. Sterling Campbell, a drummer who’s played for David Bowie and David Byrne and who got a chance to test out Sensory Percussion at Sunhouse’s office in Queens, compared it to an electric guitar. ""Just from a creative side, you’re always kind of envious of a guitar player,  because there’s so much you can do with pedals, looping, an iPad — you can sonically do anything on a guitar. So playing with this system was really like, 'Wow, now I can do all that.'"" ""The possibilities are pretty insane,"" said Ian Chang, the drummer for Son Lux, who’s also gotten a chance to beta test Sensory Percussion. ""It makes me think about playing the drums differently and how the whole kit can interact. It’s like playing with a different part of the brain; it’s totally crazy."" Those possibilities do come with a learning curve, though. Sensory Percussion is not for the weekend DJ, unless that DJ is already a drummer. Tlacael mentioned the possibility of using it to help teach the drums to newbies, by giving more feedback on how their hits are landing, but for the most part his system adds complexity. The initial setup process — training the program to recognize the different sounds of your own drums,  slotting in some samples and effects, and starting to play — isn’t particularly time-consuming, but the potential for customization and miniscule tweaking could lead to hours (or more realistically, days) lost down experimental rabbit holes. A week in, the Kickstarter campaign has raised over $60,000 of its $80,000 goal, and the Esparzas say that the first wave of production units should ship by January of 2016. Right now, the program can feed into MIDI-capable production software like Ableton Live to control samples, but by the time it ships it will come bundled with its own sampler system that doesn’t rely on MIDI, since, as Tenoch says, ""we have to kind of dumb the signal down to go through MIDI, so we can do a more sophisticated kind of signal processing with our own protocol."" And already, Tlacael has gotten to prove that his invention works like he originally intended — earlier this spring, he brought the Sensory Percussion prototype on a short tour with Nicolas Jaar and got a chance to test out his invention live. ""He was able to do everything,"" Jaar said. ""It feels like cheating, honestly, because a huge part of what I do live was taken off my shoulders. It was basically a dream come true.""",0.5046233204765294,0.49537667952347064,0.5096064951919299,1311,4.7711670480549202,636,5.8962264150943398,0,0,"Culture, Tech, Hands-on, Report",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

In 2005, Reddit was founded by Steve Huffman and Alexis Ohanian: two college roommates who wanted to create a place to exchange links. It wasn't a ""bastion of free speech,"" or anything even resembling a community. So it shouldn't surprise anyone that the company's new leaders, who are the same as its original founders, don't seem to know how to deal with the monster they created. Reddit's leaders — dual patriarchs who have each indulged in fantasies about democracy 2.0 — don't seem to understand that their internet message board is not actually a country and their content policy is not legislation. They don't understand their own product. Community cannot be fixed with technology; hateful language cannot be contained with a splash page. The idea that Reddit is some kind of government is a metaphor gone horribly wrong, and one that has caused its leaders to sabotage themselves when framing their obligations. For example, new Reddit CEO Steve Huffman wrote on Thursday that ""banning is like capital punishment,"" which is an absurd, intellectually childish way to talk about closing message boards that post racist memes. Still, it's pretty telling; that kind of language mostly makes sense to a swath of angry young men who think they are the new Sons of Liberty for calling Ellen Pao tyrannical. This week, Reddit users widely expected the site's worst communities to be culled after Huffman foreshadowed drastic action. As usual, here's what actually happened: yesterday, the people in charge of Reddit made more vague promises that will do very little to purge the site of its ruinous racists and trolls. As BuzzFeed's Charlie Warzel correctly put it, Reddit's community needed leadership, but what it got was more ideology.  Reddit's leaders haven't given anybody a reason to trust them Here are the key additions to the site's short list of rules: If we forgive the Reddit-as-government metaphor for a moment, it has a bigger problem. Reddit doesn't know how to be an effective government. ""I know it when I see it"" is an out-dated Supreme Court indecency standard that was used to regulate the location of porn stores. And the same problems that came up with that standard are now coming up on Reddit; Huffman had to respond to confused users and assure them that words like ""offensive"" and ""obscene"" wouldn't be used to ban the site's sex-positive BDSM and kink communities. Reddit is struggling to make clear policies, but that's not enough. It also has to do some real work to enforce them. When told by one user that the new prohibited content policy looks a lot like the old one, Huffman agreed. ""This isn't different from what we have right now,"" he wrote. ""But we really need to enforce it better."" So far the company hasn't given anybody a reason to trust it will follow through. First, the new rules aren't actually rules yet. Huffman's announcement, titled ""let's talk about content,"" was supposed to be a conversation with a community that routinely fails to police itself. But what it really looked like was a leader taking marching orders from people who will defend to the death not the right to free speech, but the obligation of a private company to provide server space for hate speech. Banning abuse has been a low priority Combating hate has never been a priority for Reddit. Despite Huffman's claim that he banned all kinds of offensive content when the site was young, the company's enforcement of bright-line rules has been most aggressive when copyright is violated. It took Anderson Cooper talking about borderline child porn on the site to snap Reddit out of its moral lethargy. Reddit hasn't given a complete picture of how it will enforce its new rules, but its overture suggests more half-measures. As part of Thursday's proposed rule changes, Huffman said the company would ban a subreddit that encouraged rape, but not r/coontown (pictured below), the site's most publicized hate community. ""The content there is offensive to many,"" Huffman wrote, ""but does not violate our current rules for banning.""   ""The content there is offensive to many, but does not violate our current rules for banning."" Banning communities that actively encourage rape is unequivocally good (even though action hasn't been taken yet), but it shouldn't end the discussion. Reddit doesn't deserve special credit for banning places that tell men to rape women. That ought to be one of the easiest decisions in the world, and the fact that it seems like a novel approach to governing a site with 160 million monthly visitors is abhorrent. Huffman's plan for hate communities like r/coontown is to quarantine them from the rest of Reddit. But the mechanism of this isolation is a joke. Former Reddit CEO Yishan Wong's approach to hateful content was telling everyone that ""each man is responsible for his own soul."" Reddit's new policies are basically a restatement of that, plus a button you have to click on. Users will eventually have to sign into Reddit to access its worst communities, but that means nothing will change for everyone who already uses Reddit — Reddit already requires you to log in to leave comments or vote on links, and those members represent the entire community. Reddit can't seem to call hate speech what it is Much like Not Safe For Work sections of the site, hate communities will have their own new gate. But Reddit doesn't even seem to know when to take a stand simply by calling things what they are; when asked how to classify these subreddits, Huffman said, ""I've tried a lot of names, and none of them fit."" How about hate speech? And how is this secondary classification different from the content Reddit says it plans on prohibiting? Where does content that ""harasses, bullies, or abuses an individual or group of people"" not overlap with ""content that violates a common sense of decency?"" As usual, Reddit users have been given little guidance from the site's leaders on what to expect. Sweeping hate under the rug won't fix the problem Furthermore, reclassification of nasty content will do nothing to keep the people who consume and create that content from infecting the rest of Reddit. There's plenty of documentation that suggests efforts to sweep these communities under the rug will be difficult, if not impossible. (Huffman indirectly admits this, calling the idea of a safe space an ""impossible concept to achieve."") Many of Reddit's powerful moderators are in charge of both the site's most popular subreddits and its most vile communities — and Reddit has no plans to stop relying on its moderators. In fact, the only solution — short of hiring more community managers, which Reddit seems unwilling to do — is to give moderators more power. That's not all bad; many of Reddit's moderators are decent, generous human beings who support vibrant communities. The site's crown jewel, the Ask Me Anything section, is run by two lawyers who value Reddit and volunteer their time to provide a useful service to everyone. But anybody can be a moderator. And that's why Reddit has been so reliable at producing troll dictators who create mini-empires full of, among other things, borderline child porn and racist trolling. The only reason this system is still in place is because Reddit's leaders seem more determined than ever to characterize Reddit as a democracy and make their decisions by vague consensus. Reddit is not a government! The Reddit-as-government myth is so patently ridiculous that it falls apart on casual inspection. The site's system of voting is designed only to arrange links in a certain order. The only other ""democratic"" feature is the ability to jump ship from a community you don't like to start a new one, which, to keep the analogy consistent, is the equivalent of telling people who don't like the president to move to Canada. Reddit's administrators also can't keep its stories straight about the site's purpose. Huffman was recently burned for saying that ""Reddit was never a bastion of free speech,"" even though his counterpart, co-founder Alexis Ohanian, has routinely portrayed Reddit that way. But there's actually no free speech on Reddit — the very fact that we keep talking about it that way allows the executives in charge of it to sidestep their responsibilities. Reddit is a company that runs a private platform, it can do whatever it wants, and what it should want to do is ban hate speech without a second thought. Instead, its leaders keep insisting on a metaphor of governance so worthless, it can't effectively provide an intellectual framework to justify rooting out cancerous hate. Reddit's leaders contradict themselves so much it's embarrassing There are so many examples of Reddit's leaders contradicting themselves, it's embarrassing. Remember how Huffman said the idea of a safe space is an impossible concept to achieve? The company's own stated values disagree. Creating ""a safe space to encourage participation"" is one of Reddit's corporate core values — along with ""allow freedom of expression."" In fact, if you just judge Reddit's leadership by the company's stated values, they've failed all over the board. Line-items like ""make deliberate decisions,"" ""turn ideas into actions and get things done,"" and ""don't be paralyzed by the status quo"" are phrases you would struggle to associate with Reddit, which has long neglected the volunteers who do all its hard work. The company's own blog is a detailed history of its narrow struggle to keep its servers running and the lights on. Reddit barely executes on its core values as a very small company. How can it be expected to steward a platform for millions of voices? Worse, Reddit's leaders don't even actually seem to understand who those voices belong to. Third party statistics on Reddit demographics peg its user composition as high as 74 percent male, and many of those male users are young. When asked about these figures, a Reddit spokesperson told The Verge that the split is 56 percent male and 44 percent female, based on a nationwide survey of 13,000 adults over 18 — meaning Reddit's perception of its userbase is something of an outlier. Reddit doesn't even seem to know who uses Reddit. Huffman says that the company will ""try more aggressive approaches"" if ""hateful users continue to spill out into mainstream Reddit."" But hateful users pervade mainstream Reddit; their words and ideas can be found nearly everywhere, whether it's casual talk about rape, or a meme of Neil deGrasse Tyson as ""black science man."" It's definitely not an easy problem to solve, just like solving racism is not easy — but there are obvious ways to attack it. Banning places like coontown is an easy first step. Too bad Reddit's leaders lack the courage to take it.",0.3778577627774595,0.6221422372225405,0.15173601231991288,1806,4.9806201550387597,817,6.3855569155446759,0,2,"Culture, Web, Editorial",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

""Self-driving"" isn't a single gadget, chip, or piece of software installed in a car; it's an entire array of sensors and computers that monitor the environment and make sure that your ride gets safely from point A to point B. Many of those components are already in production cars, and have been for years: take dynamic cruise control, for instance, which uses radar to look for cars ahead of you and automatically keeps a safe distance. In some cars, cameras on the windshield can look for lane markers and warn you when you're not staying within them.   In a matter of months, Tesla will be rolling out software updates for its Model S that allow it to drive itself on highways. On private roads, it'll even be able to pick you up in the morning on a schedule of your choosing and park itself in a garage at night. 2017's Cadillacs will offer something called ""Super Cruise,"" which is basically the same thing. About all that's left before we've got fully autonomous cars is dealing with inclement weather and figuring out how to safely drive on surface streets in all situations. (Research projects like Google's self-driving car are getting close.)   Most of what we know about the design of the modern automobile is based on the assumption that we actually have to drive it ourselves. If we — us human beings, that is — get taken out of the equation, cars can look like just about anything. Why not maximize space, or get rid of the windows so it's easier to take a nap?

Sitting down just a few moments later, he slyly looked down and slid them onto the ring next to keys for his Tesla. His half-hour or so commute is now 17 minutes — legally, that is. I'm not in some gleaming garage or an airplane hangar, but in the second floor of Autodesk's headquarters in San Francisco. That's an odd place for a motorcycle, but it's also crucial to how this particular two-wheeled monster was created. The software company helped the bike’s maker, Lightning Motorcycles, design the swingarm in the back of the bike using its 3D software. That’s the thing that helps motorcycles keep their rear wheel attached, which is kind of important when you're traveling at 218 miles per hour.  I’m here because Lightning’s finally delivering the first of its electric motorcycles to customers, which could also be classified as street-legal rockets. Lightning’s first bike, the LS-218, has set new land speed records. It's basically trying to do to bikes what Tesla has done to cars: it’s making electric rides that push the limits of speed and performance. The LS-218, which owner No. 1 Troy Helming purchased a year ago, gets its name from how fast it goes. In the company’s testing, it’s gotten the bike up to 218 miles per hour, which makes it the fastest production electric motorcycle in the world. Yet one of the most interesting aspects of the $38,000 motorcycle, which comes out to less after numerous state credits and rebates, is not the speed, but the chance to reimagine what motorcycles could be using electric motors. It turns out that the designers had to hold back to keep buyers of regular gas motorcycles from being spooked. Going electric meant no more considerations for where the gas tank was, or creating a complex exhaust system that does its job without setting your legs on fire. That presented new possibilities for changing the way bikes looked (think Tron). But veteran motorcycle designer Glynn Kerr, who created the look of the LS-218, says there were certain considerations to keep people who buy motorcycles from taking one look at it and running for the hills. ""This isn’t a regular gas bike, but how do you show that? You have the same function — it has to hold a human being, and the aerodynamics are the same. How much do we make this something new?"" Kerr asks. ""There’s a 10 percent level,"" he says, ""Where if you take people past 10 percent, they start questioning it."" Kerr’s answer is a bike that could easily be mistaken for a gas bike, at least while it’s parked. There are vestiges of the old system like a chain, which Lightning founder and president Richard Hatfield says is the only thing besides the wind that you hear while riding. There’s that, and the usual bulge just in front of where you sit, which now houses things like the battery and electric motor. On closer inspection you also notice there’s no muffler. Given that it's a battery-powered system, there are limitations. You get about a 100 mile range, which Hatfield says depends on how you ride it. Just like electric cars, the faster you go, the less range there is. Even so, the technology promises to be cheaper than gasoline. In the company's speed testing at the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah earlier this year, for instance, a 7-mile speed run cost just 15 cents worth of electricity, which test driver Jim Hoogerhyde says would normally run him $40 in fuel. Lightning says it’s gotten more than 200 inquiries about purchasing an LS-218. It's not the first maker of electric motorcycles, but it's been incredibly aggressive about targeting speed records. The first five people who ordered this bike are getting them now, with the company tracking what happens with them closely before opening up sales to a wider group. Next, Lightning wants to make an upright model akin to KTM's Super Duke that will use some of the same technologies that can be found in the LS-218. Hatfield says that version will have some exposed components that push that idea of an electric motorcycle beyond this familiar look, and into something new. And you can bet it will be fast.",0.5558417023860304,0.44415829761396963,0.4564965574269637,741,4.8259109311740893,417,5.6354916067146279,0,28,"Transportation, Photo Essay",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

For example, on occasion, Australian actor and bona fide motorsports aficionado Eric Bana approaches you in a deserted sliver of Boston, alone and wearing a backpack. He asks when it comes out, how it performs. Then he wanders off into the golden rays of the mid-morning horizon, destination unknown.  In fairness, I can’t say with certainty that it was Eric Bana. (I tried bribing him, to no avail.) But I do know that people have a fascination with this car that’s unrivaled by any road-going object I’ve ever been around.  Effectively explaining the i8 in a few words can be a challenge. For lack of a better description, it’s BMW’s exclamation point: an unapologetic, outrageous supercar that looks unlike anything else the auto industry has ever made. In that regard it echoes unmistakable BMW icons like the 507 and M1, but the i8 is more than just a unique car — it’s an over-the-top expression of BMW’s vision for the future of the automobile.   It’s a mess of beautiful contradictions. It’s an exotic with just 357 total horsepower; it’s an electric car with a gasoline engine; it’s one of the most expensive cars BMW makes, yet has one of the lowest fuel costs.  I spent three days driving this four-wheeled, carbon fiber-wrapped cluster of insanity through the spectacular New England fall. Eric Bana, eat your heart out.   My journey in the i8, which took me 960 miles from our New York City office to Maine’s Acadia National Park and back, started inconspicuously enough in a Manhattan parking garage. Actually, that’s a lie: not a single thing about the i8 is inconspicuous. Just getting into this car is a spectacle. One does not simply ""get into the i8,"" you see. You need a plan. If you don’t have a plan, your reckless nonchalance imperils your dignity as you flop helplessly between the pavement, the i8’s deeply recessed passenger compartment, and the tall, wide sill of fancy carbon-reinforced plastic that separates the two. Everyone looks the same the first time they try to get into the car: a hesitant approach, followed by a tentative duck, as if they’re about to leap headfirst into the cabin and worry about the legs later. That doomed tactic is quickly abandoned and followed by a leg-first technique, which eventually succeeds with wildly varying levels of elegance. The entire time, you’re at risk of bumping your skull against the open door, which rests just overhead. Just getting into this car is a spectacle Door anxiety was gripping me, rushing through my mind as I headed to the Manhattan neighborhood of Chelsea to pick the car up. I handed the parking attendant my paperwork, proving that I’d somehow convinced BMW to lend me a car worth more than my last several cars put together. His eyes grew wide. ""This is the one with the suicide doors, right?"" I briefly considered explaining the difference between suicide doors (which open rearward) and the i8’s scissor doors, but I knew what he meant; more importantly, they’re both conspicuous methods of egress designed to call attention to yourself as you step out of your whip and onto the set of Miami Vice. Cast in that light, I figure all crazy doors are suicide doors.   The garage was small, working stiffs’ rides stacked two high on the tail end of a Friday afternoon. After a few minutes spent searching for the i8 among the steel towers, the valet pulled it out onto the curb from an adjacent building. It was the first time in my journey that the car got special treatment, but it certainly wouldn’t be the last. The valet handed me the key and smiled. ""Enjoy it."" Easier said than done. I still had to come to grips with the challenge of getting into the i8, and my chances of looking cool getting into a fancy car in the heart of Chelsea, surrounded by trendy Manhattanites, were practically nil. That’s a shame, because a sloppy entrance doesn’t do the i8 justice. It’s not just striking in the standard, gaze upon this meticulously designed supercar sort of way, the way you might stare at a Ferrari 458 or a Porsche 918. The i8 looks like an artifact from Tron fell out of the heavens somewhere near Munich and was given a once-over by some of the most fanatical automotive engineers in the world. It’s not particularly common to see a supercar delivered from the factory with a multicolor paint scheme — monochromatic often works best, because the cars’ lines speak for themselves — but the i8 is a rare exception. My test car was silver and black with a touch of blue, and all three serve an important function: silver is the primary color, while black helps conceal the substantial vent on the hood and causes the science-fiction taillights to stand out from the remainder of the rear. Streaks of blue and a matching ring around the BMW roundel subtly identified the electric powertrain. It sounds ostentatious, but it just kind of works. I’m actually not sure a monochrome i8 would look very good. After a couple walkarounds, I realized I was just distracting myself from the very real task of climbing into the car, so I did. It wasn’t pretty, but I got in. I fiddled with the transmission joystick until I figured out how to pop it into drive, and shuttled off. Piloting the i8 on public roads is about the closest you can get to feeling like Bruce Wayne without literally being Batman. You’re low to the ground, practically sitting on the pavement, next to slivers of windows that don’t even roll down all the way (forget trying to look 5 percent cooler by throwing your elbow over the sill). The effect is enhanced at night by a series of beautiful light pipes on the dashboard and doors. They glow a rich blue by default, but can be reconfigured to glow orange or white depending on your mood and whether your Tron character is good or evil. You can also turn them off, but you don’t own this car to drive it with the light pipes disabled. That would be crazy. The closest you can get to feeling like Bruce Wayne without literally being Batman I drove the i8 with two white-knuckled fists on the steering wheel and my head on a swivel, partly because it wasn’t mine, but also because it has the old sports car curse of limited visibility. Your rear view is through two panes of glass — one separating you from the engine compartment (ostensibly to cut noise) and the actual rear window, which is a deeply slanted hexagon. Blind spots are a challenge, too, but the car is outfitted with a bunch of tools to help: the side mirrors have built-in convex sections to cover the blind spots, and there are a bunch of cameras and sensors all over the place that identify obstacles. If you’re dangerously close to something, a computer-generated overhead view of the car on the iDrive display helps negotiate tight spaces.   The i8 evokes strong, instant reactions everywhere it goes. It takes a truly enormous event to draw the attention of Manhattanites who spend their entire lives in a state of sensory overload, yet I couldn’t travel more than a block without pedestrians grinning from ear to ear and whipping out their phones to take pictures. Some stood directly next to the car and indulged in a selfie. A garbage truck operator honked and gave me a thumbs-up. In the few fleeting seconds waiting for each red light to turn green, fellow drivers all wanted to know the same thing: What is it? How much power does it have? Is it electric? How much does it cost? ""Hey!"" a limo driver shouted from my left side. ""You want to trade, you let me know."" He went on to summon my attention three different times as we traveled in adjacent lanes up 10th Avenue, his New York accent thick and genuine, asking the usual questions about the car and fondly recalling the memory of his Mercedes-Benz CLS 500. ""I had the first one in all of Manhattan,"" he beamed, proudly proclaiming that the swoopy four-door coupe elicited similar reactions when it first came out that the i8 was getting now. In Queens’ Astoria Park, the first of our many stops to shoot the car, drivers were quite literally coming to a full stop in the middle of the street to gawk. ""You made me do a U-turn,"" said one in a late-model BMW 3-Series that was full of twentysomethings looking for trouble on a Friday night. I felt like I was walking the world’s cutest dog through Central Park, except instead of a dog it was a six-figure testament to German insanity, and instead of Central Park it was the entirety of New England. Once we got on the expressway, Boston-bound, I was finally able to start taking in the car in earnest — its sights, its sounds, its features. (I was also finally starting to get the hang of ingress and egress, which was a big confidence-builder when we were stopping for food or bio breaks.) With the drivetrain in Comfort mode — the default, which lightens the steering and takes some fire out of the engine’s belly — the i8 is nearly silent. The mode saves a bit on gas. I don’t know why you’d ever use this; hell, even the porter who’d delivered the car to me told me to just leave it in Sport for the entire drive. You don’t buy a car that looks like this for silence. And while you might buy it to save on gas on principle, you’re not buying it to save money. (For what it’s worth, I got between 29 and 35 mpg on our trip, depending on how hard I was driving it. I suspect I could’ve done considerably better if I’d babied the throttle and stayed in Eco Pro mode, which is even more miserly than Comfort.) In Sport mode, the car makes a symphony of wonderful sounds both high-tech and low. There’s a Jetsons-esque whistle from the electric motor, another whistle of forced air from the turbo, and a thunderous growl from the… 3-cylinder engine. It’s completely incongruous for an engine this small to make this much noise. It’s accomplished in part with exhaust tuning, and in part by artificially enhancing the engine sound through the i8’s speaker system. Yes, the noise is fake. No, I don’t care. It sounds great, it sounds like a sports car is supposed to sound. It’s music to the ears, and if you didn’t know what was going on, you’d swear it was the genuine article. There will come a day in a decade or three when adults are accustomed to fast, silent sports cars, but until that day comes, BMW has carte blanche to make this gas sipper sound like a guzzler, as far as I’m concerned. There’s also a mode that BMW calls ""eDrive,"" selected by pressing a button next to the ignition, which tries really hard (but doesn’t promise) to run the car on electric power alone. The i8 reminds me of other gas-dependent plug-in hybrids in that it’s not really intended to run in an electric-only mode for an extended period of time; it cuts over to gas if you go above 75 miles per hour (which, to be fair, will cover your legal activities on the overwhelming majority of American roads). More to the point, BMW quotes a maximum electric range of just 22 miles, and I never saw the range gauge go above 11, which isn’t going to get you very far unless you use your German exotic exclusively for tragically slow, short jaunts around the isle of Manhattan. I couldn’t fully test the i8’s chops as an EV — the company supplied me with a European-spec model and warned me not to plug it in, if for no other reason than the fact that the supplied charger had a euro plug on it. Sport and Comfort mode both partially recharge the batteries automatically while you drive, but I was never able to fully replenish the pack. (If I had, it would’ve happened in about an hour and a half on a standard Level 2 charger, according to BMW’s literature.) BMW has carte blanche to make this gas sipper sound like a guzzler, as far as I’m concerned In Sport mode, BMW claims a 0-60 run in 4.2 seconds, which feels about right; even eDrive, which doesn’t benefit from the gas engine’s extra punch, feels fast. Acceleration isn’t instantaneous, though. I’d mash on the pedal expecting to be immediately glued to the back of my seat, only to be let down; it was almost as if the car was saying ""wait for it…"" before lighting the afterburners. I imagine it’s a side effect of an extraordinarily complex drivetrain that needs to coordinate power from two completely different systems — a two-speed, 129-horsepower motor in front and a six-speed engine with 228 horsepower in back — but there are lots of cars on the road, many at the $100,000 mark or below, that could smoke the i8. It’s easy to get cocky in a car that looks like this, but it’s not recommended. It does handle well, which doesn’t really come as a surprise: it’s a low-slung supercar, after all. There’s also BMW’s fanatical demand for 50:50 weight distribution, putting a nearly identical amount of mass fore and aft. It’s not particularly light — curb weight is listed at 3,455 pounds — but it would’ve been even heavier had the company used a traditional construction technique instead of the carbon fiber-reinforced plastic that comprises the entire frame. You can see bits of it in the door sills and around the trunk; it’s not as beautiful or as meticulously laid as a traditional carbon fiber weave, but it still looks different and cool. Over the next day and a half, we finished our drive to Boston before eventually reaching Maine’s beautiful Acadia National Park in search of the perfect backdrops for our shoot. Along the way, we were stopped by two extremely friendly and awesome Massachusetts State Police officers, a throng of curious onlookers, and one possible Eric Bana. That kind of road trip requires luggage. It’s a lucky thing I had a chase car following me, because the i8 has the least storage space of any car I’ve driven since my microscopic Lotus Elise: the rear glass pops open to reveal a trunk that would be generously described as a ""nook,"" or perhaps a ""cranny."" That’s the peril of a mid-engine car — the three-banger is concealed beneath a black carpeted box that consumes the overwhelming majority of the rear space. The rear glass pops open to reveal a trunk that would be generously described as a ""nook,"" or perhaps a ""cranny"" Some rear-engined cars — Porsche 911s, for instance — make up for the indiscretion with a front bonnet that can hold a couple bags. Not the i8, though: that’s where the electric motor is. In fact, the front of the car can’t even be opened at all without some trouble. The space of last resort, then, is the area occupied by the rear seats — but they’re deeply bucketed, which can make placing luggage a challenge (as I discovered). A few bags of groceries wouldn’t be a problem, but road trips in an i8 are best enjoyed with a support vehicle, which you can probably afford if you’re driving a $150,000 car. For all the high-design futurism of the exterior, the interior is a bit bland. It’s not ugly by any stretch, it’s just not much nicer than BMWs that cost half as much. The trimmings are basically the same as the ones you’d find in a 3- or 5-series: there’s an iDrive controller in the center that maps to a widescreen display resting atop the center console, which is how you control navigation, entertainment, and an almost endless array of vehicle settings. The gear selector, which is basically a joystick, is also raided from the company-wide parts bin. The wide tunnel separating the driver from the front passenger is certainly cool and supercar-ish, but the two storage compartments in it are barely an inch or two deep, and there’s only a single cupholder to share between you and your driving partner. Two more cupholders at the back of the tunnel service the rear passengers, which is funny, because the rear seats are the punchline to a six-figure joke: there’s absolutely no reason for them to exist. It’s possible you could stow a toddler back there, but really, you’re not buying an i8 to haul three or four people around. BMW should’ve just chucked the rear accommodations, saved the weight, and made this a genuine two-seater.     Of course, it’s sacrilege to judge a car like this by its storage options or its cupholders — who drinks in an i8, like a heathen? — but when you’re trying to make it to Maine and back in the span of a couple days, willfully excessive caffeination is an inevitability. The heads-up display (HUD) on the i8, which is similar to the system found on other BMWs, is really good. I really never looked at the instrument cluster while driving, actually, which is a testament to the HUD’s usability. I’ve used heads-up systems extensively, and I really do believe that good ones have a material impact on safety by keeping your eyes up on the road where they belong. This one does the job: I always felt like my current speed was somehow being beamed directly into my brain, which is what a good HUD does for you — it just becomes an ambient nexus of information, not something you need to concentrate on. The instrument cluster is less impressive: the surround looked weirdly plain to me, as if engineers had taken a tablet, masked off part of the display with paint, and glued the resulting Frankencluster to the dash. It’s just not fitting for a car that looks and feels like this. BMW does make nice instrument clusters for sports cars — just look at the M4 and M6 — but those are digital-analog hybrids, incorporating both dials and displays. For the i-Series, it seems, BMW is sticking with digital displays alone, and those are harder to dress up. (It’s no surprise, then, that the i3 also uses a plain-looking LCD for the cluster — albeit a smaller one.) The actual graphics on the instrument cluster are, to be fair, appropriately cool. The 8.8-inch slab of glass is dominated by a pair of sharply rendered arcs that indicate speed and power distribution — basically, whether you’re being propelled by batteries, gas, or a combination of both. Toggling the drivetrain’s Sport mode changes the color scheme from blue to red, a non-verbal way of communicating that you’ve summoned all the power that the i8’s two sources of propulsion can muster. There are faster vehicles you can buy for the price of the i8, vehicles with better pedigrees and more legitimate sports car credentials. But you don’t buy the i8 for any of that: you buy it because it’s a tightly-wound bundle of technology and forward design. You buy it because it’s the closest thing to a road-going concept car. You buy it because it’s kind of weird. You buy it because it’s a conversation starter, even among hardened NYPD street cops working the graveyard shift. You also buy it because you have a lot of money to spare. We lingered far too long in Maine just taking in the car, enjoying it, sharing it with countless passersby, and shooting it from every conceivable angle. We didn’t get back into New York City until early the next morning, just hours before BMW was scheduled to pick it up. One of our final moments with the car took us through a deserted Times Square, which seemed fitting: electricity meeting electricity, spectacle meeting spectacle. You buy it because it’s the closest thing to a road-going concept car; you buy it because it’s kind of weird As I searched for a Manhattan garage that seemed trustworthy enough to hand the i8’s keys at 3 in the morning, an NYPD cruiser lit me up. Drowsy from 16 hours of driving and filming, I briefly considered that a high-speed chase through the Big Apple would be the perfect end to this story; I came to my senses about a third of a second later and drifted off to the side of 29th Street. The officer approached my window, flashlight shining directly in my eyes. I’d turned right on a red, which is illegal here, it turns out. After a stern talking-to, the conversation inevitably turned to the car. ""I asked my partner, what is that, a Lambo?"" I explained that it was not, in fact, a Lambo. I showed him the scissor doors, the carbon fiber; I described the unusual engine configuration. He smiled and told me to be safe; I told him to visit The Verge.

(Wikimedia Commons) Towering chimneys have long been thought of as a potential alternative to traditional solar panels, but so far the concept has failed to become a viable reality. But aeronaut Per Lindstrand thinks he has the solution — making the chimneys inflatable. Lindstrand — who is best known for his record-breaking hot air balloon flights with Sir Richard Branson — is working to potentially develop the concept as a source of power for the ALMA Observatory in Chile. Known as a solar updraft tower, the concept was proposed as far back as 1903, and involves using the sun to create an updraft of hot air in the chimney, which is then used to drive turbines and produce power.  ""A lot of it can be dealt with by good design."" However, construction issues have so far held the idea back. In 1982 an experimental tower was erected in Spain, but after eight years it succumbed to the wear and tear of the weather and was decommissioned. An inflatable version, however, could remove issues like rust and wind erosion. ""You do need to choose the right materials,"" Lindstrand tells The Engineer. ""I suspect some kind of treatment might be necessary as well. It's the sort of thing that eventually becomes an economic question."" The proposed chimney would be 1 kilometer (3,280 feet) tall, and as big as 7 kilometers (22.960 feet) wide at its base. The inflatable nature would not only make the design potentially more weather resistant, but also cheaper — Lindstrand estimates that it would cost $20 million to build, while a concrete version could cost upwards of $750 million. There are possible issues with the proposal — like finding a material that won't tear and can stand up to UV radiation — but Lindstrand is optimistic those problems can be solved.

In a lengthy letter to Tim Cook, Icahn argues that Apple should make a tender offer to begin buying back stock from shareholders. Icahn says that there is a ""massive undervaluation"" in its stock right now, which would make buying up shares a good deal for Apple. Apple also has an enormous stockpile of money that it could be spending — $133 billion and growing — far beyond what it needs to make large acquisitions or fund new infrastructure.  Icahn sees a ""massive undervaluation"" in Apple's stock A large tender offer would, of course, benefit Icahn, by driving up the price of the stock. ""To preemptively diffuse any cynical criticism,"" Icahn writes, he has committed to not tendering any shares, regardless of the price. Nonetheless, having Apple buy up other stock will bump the price of what Icahn is holding — and Icahn is holding a good bit: 53 million shares. While his plan is clearly self-interested, increasing the stock buyback would benefit all shareholders, large and small.  If you accept that Apple's stock is undervalued, as Icahn is arguing, that's a logical goal to pursue. He notes that despite Apple's strong growth and powerful brand, it's currently trading at roughly a price-to-earnings ratio of 8x, well below its peers in the tech world and the S&P 500 average. Icahn's letter may even be of some relief to Apple. Icahn is notorious for using aggressive tactics to get companies moving as he'd like, but he's instead turning to flattery here with continued praise of Cook. ""We could not be more supportive of you and your team, and of the excellent work being done at Apple,"" Icahn writes. His company believes that Apple's stock should be trading at $203 per share, whereas it opened this morning at $101.50. Another part of the reason for Icahn's far higher valuation is his belief that Apple has some major new products coming, including a $1,500 4K TV. He also sees Apple selling 72.5 million Apple Watches in 2017. Icahn has actually been proposing that Apple buy up more stock for a good while now. He dropped his last campaign for further stock buy backs earlier this year, having been satisfied by the fact that Cook was already speeding up Apple's share repurchases. Apple is responding to Icahn's letter by saying just as much. In a statement to CNBC, Apple says that ""since 2013 we've been aggressively executing the largest capital return program in corporate history."" Apple says that it will review the program annually, taking into account shareholder feedback.",0.6973067604840968,0.3026932395159032,0.4994556897848755,449,4.8574610244988863,263,5.7642585551330798,0,0,"Apple, Business",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

That figure comes from a court document filed by Apple's sapphire glass supplier, GT Advanced Technologies (GTAT), which is currently going through bankruptcy proceedings that are, in part, related to what it calls ""oppressive and burdensome"" agreements with Apple.  Even the confidentiality agreements are confidential It appears that several secrecy arrangements are among those agreements. Though the court document doesn't refer to Apple by name, GTAT notes that it may be subject to these heavy fines for violating various confidentiality agreements that it's made with another company — and it's hard to imagine another partner of GTAT's imposing such steep penalties. The Financial Times also reports that the third party is Apple. This incredible level of confidentiality is making bankruptcy proceedings tough for GTAT. Not only is it requesting that the court allow it to file certain documents in secret — which Reuters reports is ""unusual"" for a bankruptcy filing — GTAT is also asking that even its request for secrecy be kept a secret. ""GTAT recognizes the unusual (and perhaps unprecedented) nature of the request,"" it writes in a court filing. The company writes that the potential fees have ""compelled"" it to request this level of confidentiality. GTAT is also seeking to shut down the Arizona plant it uses to make sapphire glass for Apple.

""AND NOT AS COOL AS THIS ONE."" The GIF concluded with a selfie of Josh making a beaver face. It’s pretty much my favorite message of 2014, and I asked Josh how he made it. It turned out he’d used an app called UltraText, which he found on a site called Product Hunt. A must-read site in Silicon Valley Inspired by earlier sites Reddit and Hacker News, in 10 months Product Hunt has gone from a small email discussion list to a fast-growing community with a popular website and iPhone app. (The daily email is popular, too.) Each day, users submit new apps, software services, and other tech products. People vote up their favorites, and entrepreneurs often join in on discussions to explain their design decisions and answer users’ questions. Only 1 to 2 percent of users have been invited to comment, and it’s an elite group — venture capitalists, entrepreneurs, and journalists are heavily represented. As a result it’s the rare comments section that’s worth reading, and it’s one reason that Product Hunt has become a must-read site in Silicon Valley. Today the company has some money to go with the buzz: founder Ryan Hoover announced that the company has raised $6.1 million from investors including Andreessen Horowitz and Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian. Hoover says he’ll use the money to grow his team, build an Android app, and expand to let people recommend products beyond the world of tech. In the meantime, Product Hunt is also adding the ability for users to follow other users to receive more tailored recommendations.   In a relatively short time, Product Hunt has become a kind of early-warning system for apps that are about to break out. TapTalk, a fast-growing picture messaging app, got a seed investment from the venture capital firm SV Angel after a partner discovered it there. Traffic to Product Hunt has grown 50 percent every month since January, and each month it drives 2 million visits to the products featured on its leaderboard. ""Prior to Product Hunt, Ultratext had almost no downloads,"" Andrew Farmer, one of UltraText's founders, told me in an email. ""Through Product Hunt we got noticed by you guys and also got a TechCrunch article. Product Hunt directly or indirectly led to tens of thousands of downloads for us."" Still, Product Hunt’s initial audience comprises people whose livelihood depends on getting in early on the next big thing. Can a service for tech nerds go mainstream? That we’re even asking the question is a testament to Hoover, who has an unlikely hit on his hands. At first blush, a service devoted to surfacing apps and other tech ephemera looks gratuitous. Platform owners like Apple and Google offer leaderboards of their own, in the form of their top download charts, and they regularly feature new apps across their respective app stores. Meanwhile, a host of mainstream and niche publications pay obsessive attention to the tech world, highlighting new products on an hourly basis. But as it turns out, each of those channels is flawed in its own way. Most-downloaded charts tend to reward only a handful of top performers, and are difficult to crack without an expensive marketing campaign. Getting featured in an app store is often a matter of who a developer knows at Apple or Google. And product coverage in the press is often driven by public relations, which is available only to the already rich and well connected. A way of appealing to early adopters Little wonder, then that developers have seized on Product Hunt as a way of appealing to a group of early-adopting enthusiasts. The leaderboard resets itself every day at midnight Pacific time, giving entrepreneurs a perpetual clean slate to try to get users’ attention. The leaderboard rankings take into account user votes and also when in the day something was posted — if it’s later, the product may get boosted above something that has more votes depending on how quickly it accumulated them. It’s the perfect place to discover an app like UltraText, which was built as a side project by two friends with no interest in turning it into a venture-backed startup. ""Today more and more people are building products,"" Hoover says. ""They may not be traditional startups, but they’re still making interesting, useful products that people want to discover."" On the other hand — Product Hunt can be exhausting. There are few things I enjoy more than finding a cool new thing to do with my phone, and yet I still open the morning email from Product Hunt with a sense of fatigue. Every day, the email offers five more things to look at — the site’s leaderboard shows 20 — and the more things you look at, the more disposable they all seem. Hoover sees the apps on Product Hunt less as lifelong companions than media you consume in the same way you might a television show — for a few weeks, say, until you finish with it. The average person downloads zero apps per month But even that might be wishful thinking — the average person, after all, downloads zero apps per month. Hoover, whose iPhone contains 14 pages of apps, is an outlier, and so is the community he’s built. His plan to expand the community is to create versions of Product Hunt for other categories, starting next year (most likely) with video games. Hoover imagines a world where whatever you’re interested in, there will be a Product Hunt for it, and it will help you find cool things that would otherwise stay hidden. And it will make money through ads, or affiliate links, or something more creative. Of course, if the tech world’s current boom times turn to bust, there may be less fodder for Product Hunt’s endless hamster wheel of phone-based distractions. (It’s one reason why the company would be smart to get those other verticals going in a hurry.) But for now, at least, it’s the best coolhunt on the internet — relentlessly positive, easy to use, and adept at finding gems. ""I hate using the word ‘democratizing,’ but I’m just going to use it anyway,"" Hoover says. ""Product Hunt is allowing anything from a VC-backed company to a weekend hack project to get (attention).""

Though the rules passed last month, the full text of the order hasn't been available until now. Even ahead of the vote, only those in the commission were able to see its actual text. That's not unusual, but considering the significance of this particular vote, a lot of noise was made by dissenting commissioners Ajit Pai and Michael O'Rielly about getting it released to the public. That's finally happened, though it occurred on the commission's normal timeline.  ""We listened. We learned. And we adjusted our approach based on the public record."" One of the big questions this document answers is which Title II regulations the commission won't be applying to internet service. It turns out to be quite a lot: more than 700 rules aren't going to be applied. ""This includes no unbundling of last-mile facilities, no tariffing, no rate regulation, and no cost accounting rules, which results in a carefully tailored application of only those Title II provisions found to directly further the public interest in an open internet and more, better, and open broadband,"" the order says. The idea that this proposal is a so-called ""light touch"" approach to regulation has been touted again and again, basically as a way to quell concerns from those who oppose regulation. Of course, it hasn't exactly done that, and we're still seeing plenty of complaints from the internet providers that are now having their services classified under Title II. The order focuses on three specific rules for internet service: no blocking, no throttling, and no paid prioritization. ""A person engaged in the provision of broadband internet access service, insofar as such person is so engaged, shall not impair or degrade lawful internet traffic on the basis of internet content, application, or service, or use of a non-harmful device, subject to reasonable network management,"" the order states, while outlining its rules against throttling. For paid prioritization, the order explains the practice as: Notably, the order does not place regulations on interconnect points, which are what Netflix has been arguing with internet providers about for the last year. Instead, the order simply states that the FCC has the authority to hear complaints regarding interconnect, which will seemingly be addressed on an individual basis. ""While we have more than a decade’s worth of experience with last-mile practices, we lack a similar depth of background in the internet traffic exchange context,"" the order says. ""Thus, we find that the best approach is to watch, learn, and act as required, but not intervene now, especially not with prescriptive rules."" The commission does still allow internet providers to perform ""reasonable network management,"" which might affect service. However, there are also strict rules as to what is and is not ""reasonable."" The commission says that reasonable management is something that primarily has a technical justification, not something that has a business purpose. It also specifically calls out Verizon's attempt to throttle the speeds of people on its unlimited data plans — that, seemingly, will not fly under these rules. AT&T basically says it's ""confident"" the order will be torn down This final order is quite different from what commission chairman Tom Wheeler first proposed a year ago. He speaks to that in a statement accompanying the order's release. ""We listened. We learned. And we adjusted our approach based on the public record,"" he says. ""In the process we saw a graphic example of why open and unfettered communications are essential to freedom of expression in the 21st century."" AT&T has taken the occasion to issue another vague threat / criticism of the order. ""Unfortunately, the order released today begins a period of uncertainty that will damage broadband investment in the United States,"" AT&T exec Jim Cicconi says in a statement. ""Ultimately, though, we are confident the issue will be resolved by bipartisan action by Congress or a future FCC, or by the courts."" When AT&T says ""uncertainty,"" what it means is that either it or another internet provider is probably going to sue, potentially bringing down the rules. How good the FCC's chances in court are depends on who you ask, but the commission typically has the authority to interpret how to apply rules like Title II. Of course, the commission isn't actually worried that the rules will hamper broadband investment. That's because, for all of the threats it's received, it's also heard from internet providers like Sprint that the order won't actually change its investments, so long as the rules aren't too strict. From what the commission has said, they're not, so there's a good chance that AT&T and others are bluffing, trying to scare the commission with the threat of lessened investment, which it cares quite a bit about.

The report by the Intelligence and Security Committee (ISC) said that the UK's spies ""do not seek to circumvent the law,"" and that their activities do not constitute ""blanket surveillance"" or ""indiscriminate surveillance."" However, the report condemns the legal framework surrounding digital surveillance in the UK, saying it is ""unnecessarily complicated and – crucially – lacks transparency."" ""The current, overly complicated, legislation."" The inquiry by the ISC was launched in 2013 after leaks by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden revealed the extent of online surveillance by both the US and UK. ""In a democratic society,"" says the heavily-censored report, ""those powers cannot be unconstrained: limits and safeguards are essential."" The report concludes that its findings are ""reassuring,"" but that they ""do not obviate the need for a thorough overhaul of the current, overly complicated, legislation."" The ISC states that the bulk interception of data by GCHQ and other UK spy agencies is necessary not only to investigate specific threats, but also discover new leads. GCHQ reportedly targets a ""very small percentage of the ‘bearers’ that make up the internet"" (these bearers are described as international fibre optic cables carrying up to 10 gigabits of data per second), and that only a ""very tiny percentage"" of communications that are collected are actually opened by analysts. ""fewer than *** of *** per cent of the items that transit the internet are read."" However, it's difficult to judge just how small this percentage actually is, as any concrete figures are censored. For example, the report says with regards to the interception of messages: ""In practice, this means that fewer than *** of *** per cent of the items that transit the internet in one day are ever selected to be read by a GCHQ analyst."" A separate report from the UK's Interception of Communication Commissioner's Office (IOCCO) also published today offers a little more insight. It says that in 2014, the UK issued 2,795 warrants to intercept communications data, that is, to open up and read a message's content. Of these, says the IOCCO, 60 were ""interception errors,"" a category that includes mistakes ranging from ""over-collection"" to ""unauthorized selection."" Access to Communications data was authorized half a million times In 2014, however, the UK also saw more than half a million authorizations (517,236) for police and law enforcement agencies to access ""communications data."" In the ISC's report this category is defined as ""the details about a communication – the ‘who, when and where’ – but not the content of what was said or written."" The IOCCO says that although there were ""some examples where [these] powers had been used improperly or unnecessarily,"" on the whole it was happy that there was no ""significant institutional overuse"" of communications data. The report by the ISC also said that a small number of staff at intelligence agencies in the UK had been dismissed for inappropriately accessing data. One GCHQ staff member is mentioned as being ""dismissed"" for ""misusing access to GCHQ’s systems,"" while an undisclosed number of individuals from other agencies have been ""disciplined – or in some cases dismissed.""

The most important news from the decision has been net neutrality — it's now illegal to prioritize certain kinds of web traffic for money — but there's a separate, more obscure provision that had raised the alarm for many network engineers, and the new rules put it in a radically different light. Services will be forced to compete to see who can run the cleanest network The center of the controversy is packet loss, the basic noise that comes when networks lose track of data in transit. The new rules will force internet providers to measure and publish data on packet loss across their networks. The idea behind the move is simple: if Comcast lists less packet loss than Optimum, say, you might be more inclined to use their service, anticipating fewer hiccups in your data feed. Internet protocols are built to withstand packet loss, the same way a car won’t stop because of a few bumps in the pavement, but extremely high loss can still slow or stop streaming and browsing. If consumers flock to services with less packet loss, services will be forced to compete to see who can run the cleanest network, potentially leading to better service across the board. Packet loss is also a good measure for the kind of service decline you'd see if you were stuck in an internet slow lane, so groups from the EFF to the AARP had called for better reporting on the metric. While it seems like a harmless nudge, the idea of competing for lower packet loss struck many engineers as potentially catastrophic. The problem is, packet loss isn't the best measure of a good network, and a system designed entirely to minimize packet loss might simply add more buffering, cratering latency and incentivizing slower networks overall. That led the National Cable and Television Association (already outspoken opponents of Title II) to label the packet loss provision as ""a new rule that could degrade internet performance."" ""An angel in disguise"" But now that we've got the full text of the FCC rules, the situation seems to have gone up in smoke. The FCC's initial press releases had stoked fears by only mentioning packet loss, but the full regulations describe packet loss metrics being integrated into existing requirements on average latency and bandwidth. That’s a big difference: If packet loss is the only metric, ISPs might rush to get the number as low as possible — but when it’s printed alongside bandwidth and latency, the incentives are much less perverse. Customers may not understand all the new metrics, but ISPs will be charged with balancing the three numbers, which should fend off the nightmare scenario the NCTA was worried about. As a result, many early critics have already changed their tune. Nicholas Weaver, who criticized the measure after the early FCC proposals leaked, yesterday called the packet loss requirement ""an angel in disguise"" for adding crucial new information without upsetting the balance between connection speed and quality. It’s still tricky to say exactly the effect the new packet loss requirements will have. Customers may not be able to perfectly balance the new information, and ISPs could still overreact to the new requirements. Crucially, they’ll still have control over their own networks, but it’s still conceivable that network operators will overreact to the new provisions, even if they’ll have less reason to. Most of all, the controversy shows how delicate network regulation is, and how easily a minor provision can snowball into an unforeseen disaster. Luckily, in this case the unintended consequences seem to have been a false alarm.",0.4983345419850478,0.5016654580149522,0.1840072042189147,625,5.0271999999999997,347,6.0489913544668585,1,0,"Policy & Law, US & World, Report",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

It's a surprisingly light load so far, but you can expect more to arrive as we move into the weekend. For now, take a look at the nine best trailers to arrive this week.   This isn't really a trailer, but how much better would it be if all films made awesome promo videos like The Hunger Games did? The newest is an impressive military march that ends with Jennifer Lawrence strolling in looking like she's ready to rip someone apart. We're ready for it. The film comes out November 20th.   Goosebumps' meta approach to taking on Goosebumps is pretty wonderful. Everything else? Well, that depends on what you're looking for out of it. It's distinctly a kids movie, but there's still plenty of nostalgia to be had for anyone who remembers R.L. Stine's monsters. It'll be out October 16th.   Peter Capaldi is nearly back as the Doctor. The new season starts September 19th, and a first trailer for it debuted today alongside the cast's panel at Comic-Con. Even if you're not a Doctor Who fan, there's just plenty of cool sci-fi stuff going on in there.   Alan Tudyk is taking his post-Firefly convention life and turning it into a comedy series on the web. The show debuted a long first look this week during a panel at Comic-Con, and it seems like a lot of fun. Basically every nerd figure who you'd expect to be in Tudyk's friend group shows up as a star or co-star, and Tudyk certainly hopes to make more. The initial run begins September 30th, and there'll be 12 10-minute episodes in all.   Bryan Cranston is heading back to comedy with an animated web series on Crackle. The show comes from the studio behind Robot Chicken, so if you're into that style of humor, this one is probably worth paying attention to. If you're not, go ahead and pass. It starts this fall.   Netflix has grabbed Chris Tucker's first standup special. It's only promoted this minute-long clip so far, but it's a good sign that Tucker is bringing all of the energy to the stage that audiences love to see from him. It comes out today, so you should already be able to start streaming.   Disney has a new thriller coming out starring Chris Pine as a 1950s Coast Guard captain who heads out into a storm to save a ravaged ship. But the real story here isn't Pine or Disney: it's Craig Gillespie, the film's director. There's good reason to believe he can turn this into something special. We'll find out next year; it's out on January 29th.   Save your hipster jokes. Brooklyn is about an Irish immigrant in 1950s Brooklyn who's bouncing between different cultures, including her own family as they try to bring her back to Ireland. The film got great reviews out of Sundance, and it'll be out in theaters November 6th.

When I first see him on the show floor, he’s holding up his phone, taking video of the massive Orgrim Doomhammer statue at Legendary Pictures’ booth. Orgrim is one of the lead characters in Jones’ upcoming big-screen adaptation of Warcraft, a film that he hopes will kick off a series of movies, and the director is full of excitement and smiles as he talks about the film. It’s even more impressive considering he’s been steadily working on the project for two and a half years. Speaking with journalists that same night, Jones reveals that while the film won’t debut until June 10th, 2016 — it was pushed from a 2015 release date thanks to Star Wars — it’s already completely finished save for 10 visual effects shots in the works from Industrial Light & Magic. During the conversation, he gladly touches upon a number of topics, including his history as a gamer, his desire to shepherd a full-fledged Warcraft trilogy, and how he hopes to squeeze in one more film before Warcraft opens and Azeroth consumes his life forever. Duncan Jones: World of Warcraft’s been going on for about 20 years, and the first 10 years were kind of real-time strategy games, and then World of Warcraft started about 10 years ago. I’ve been playing back since Orcs & Humans, the first real-time strategy game. I actually used to play Lost Vikings, which was a game that Blizzard even made before that, so I’ve been playing for a long time.  Orgrim Doomhammer statue. DJ: By design, right from the start, it was imperative that we came up with a story which stood in its own right, and brought an audience who didn’t know Warcraft along with it. Not everyone, I think, that saw the first Lord of the Rings movie had read Tolkien. And yet, Peter Jackson did a wonderful job of being able to bring an audience along with him and get them involved in that universe. I saw that as my job on this film. Help realize and communicate this universe that Blizzard had built up through Warcraft, and bring it to an audience that didn’t know anything about it. And with this first film I think we’ve done a great job of that. DJ: My big pitch to Blizzard when I became involved in this — because they’ve been trying to make the film for awhile; Sam Raimi was on it before me, and they weren’t able to make it work — but my pitch was I want to make a war movie, and I want to tell the story from both sides. I want heroes on both sides. I want you to empathize with both sides. And I want you to feel bad that the heroes, good characters from both sides, are going to find themselves in a conflict that there is no way out of. So that was the film that I pitched, and that’s the film I feel I delivered on. There are contingents of heroes on both sides that the audience will absolutely be rooting for, and I think there’ll be divided loyalties, and I think individuals will be divided about who they feel they should be rooting for. DJ: This film comes out in June of next year. That gives me 11 months from now until the film comes out. I’m very, very much hoping I’m going to be able to squeeze in a little independent film, science fiction, that I’ve been wanting to do for years, before this comes out. But it’s a race against time to see if I can do it. That’s my hope.  Statue of King Llane. DJ: When working on this film, we worked incredibly closely with Blizzard, and I personally got the chance to work with Chris Metzen, who does a lot of the storytelling at Blizzard. And we worked out if we did get the chance to do three films to tell a story, this would be the first piece, and we kind of have an idea of what we would do with 2 and 3. I want to be the guy to deliver that. I feel very privileged, uniquely privileged, that I got the chance to start a franchise of films — if we get the opportunity to make more. There are other franchises that are out there that I’d be incredibly privileged to do, but I love the idea that this is a universe that I’m helping realize from the start, and to me that’s something special. DJ: It’s funny, because there are certain games that really have amazing visual elements, but you’d have to do even more work on the storytelling side as far as making it work as a story. And then there are games which are so obviously film-centric and narrative that it really just becomes a job of helping them tell the story they’ve already told. The funny thing is, the games I would want to do are the ones I can’t tell you about because then someone else would grab them before I could do them myself! But I know that we’ve delivered. I know we have to wait until next year, but I do believe that as much as I enjoy comic book movies — and I think there will be a place for them — I think well-done movies based on games is a whole new world of movies, that will hopefully start to flourish as our film comes out. And hopefully Assassin’s Creed will be good as well, and there’ll be this new era, a golden age of games-to-movies.",0.6361021639163542,0.3638978360836458,0.156576425289598,954,4.3857442348008382,416,5.5865384615384617,0,4,"Comic-Con, Culture, Entertainment, Gaming, Film, Interview",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

GoFundMe announced yesterday that its donation limit was being raised from $15,000 to $50,000, and credited the change to Swift's generosity. She donated the latter amount — presumably in three chunks of $15,000 and a $5,000 kicker — to the Naomi's Fight Against Cancer campaign, which is dedicated to a young girl recently diagnosed with an aggressive form of leukemia. This isn't Swift's first time using GoFundMe to help people in need. She donated $15,000 to a Texas firefighter who saved his own wife and son from a car crash last month. Swift has a long history of fan-oriented generosity, from sending fans Christmas care packages to inviting them to hear 1989 at her apartment before its release. (Who can forget the time she met a fan in Central Park and gave her $90 when she mentioned she was going to Chipotle?) But these recent donations seem to fall into the category of straightforward altruism: there aren't any specific references to Taylor Swift fandom in either of the campaigns that have received her generosity. Because she's Taylor Swift, her donations have a ripple effect It seems like she's just flipping through GoFundMe's various drives and donating massive sums to the ones that connect with her in some way, behavior I'm loathe to stain with any cynicism. And because she's Taylor Swift, any donation she makes leads to a ripple effect: the affected campaigns get an additional wave of publicity on sites like ours, leading to even more visibility and money. From GoFundMe's perspective, the donation limit lift is only going to affect a very rich, very small slice of users, but it makes sense as a change to which Swift's continued use of the service can be pegged.

I’m Jamieson, I’m still your host, and things are a little different this week. Today marks the official global release date change — from now on, albums are going to come out on Fridays no matter where you are in the world. This is an exciting shift, but it also means that a truckload of new music came out this morning, and I haven’t had any time to hear it. I’ll be back to normal operation next week, but I’m taking this space to focus on one of the office’s favorite bits of time-honored music nerdery: a Songs of the Summer debate! I’m happy to have The Verge’s entertainment editor Emily Yoshida as a guest. We’re going to look over the contenders currently sitting at the top of Billboard’s Hot 100 and assess their merit as candidates for 2015’s crown, and we’ll each name a dark horse entry that’s captured our heart (if not the charts). Let’s begin: Wiz Khalifa ft. Charlie Puth, ""See You Again"" (current: #1, peak: #1)   Jamieson Cox: The official anthem of Furious 7 has been at the top of the Hot 100 for 12 non-continuous weeks now, a reign that easily could’ve been an uninterrupted 13 if not for a brief surge from ""Bad Blood."" There are clear musical and cultural factors motivating this insane success: ""See You Again"" is piggybacking on a beloved movie franchise, and it’s a tribute to the life and tragic death of one of the stars of said franchise. It's an easy genre crossover thanks to Wiz’s verses paired with Puth’s Wonder Bread pop-soul hook, meaning you can fit it almost anywhere on the radio.  But I want to propose a third motivator, one that helped the song sustain its momentum months after its release. Just when you might expect ""See You Again"" to start falling off, the charts rolled into June: prime graduation season. Listen closely, and you can hear the echoes of victory lap keggers and grad party bonfires: ""We’ve come a long way / from where we began…"" The song itself is mediocre, a pawn thrown around by the winds of the market. It's custom-engineered for blasting out of a teen's used convertible Emily Yoshida: First of all, thank you for welcoming me into Songs Land, just in time for my favorite annual fake debate about music! Despite its tear-jerkiness, the main thing ""See You Again"" has going for it is how eminently sing-along-able it is — the power of the ""whoa."" But I need my no. 1 song of the summer to be a JAM, and this is a little too much like ""I Will Remember You 2k15."" Say what you will about last year’s song of the summer, ""Fancy"" — at least it sounded custom-engineered for blasting out of a 16-year-old’s used convertible. But then again, ""See You Again"" is literally about Vin Diesel driving into the sunset. I dunno, I’ll let Charlie and Wiz have it. OMI, ""Cheerleader (Felix Jaehn Remix)"" (current: #2, peak: #2)   Cox: This is another proud entry in the recent tradition of buoyant, tropical, and global (read: non-American) summer hits. (Shout out to ""Am I Wrong,"" shout out to ""Rude,"" and shout out to the king: ""Somebody That I Used to Know."" Gotye forever.) I don’t like ""Cheerleader"" as much as I like those songs, but it’s a harmless, sweet piece of summer fun, one that makes me want to lie around in a kiddie pool, and so I have no formal complaints to lodge against it. Yoshida: So, in addition to ""Trap Queen"" and Jamieson’s bonus pick below, this is a huge summer for fidelity anthems. And not just songs about how good it feels to be in a committed relationship with someone — songs that specifically focus on not cheating. I first heard ""Cheerleader"" while browsing through the Billboard playlist on Spotify, and I didn’t immediately understand how it had become a hit while I was a little out of touch with the charts. But I like how spacious it is, how airy and content it feels. I like that trumpet hanging out throughout the song. I also might just be responding to the fact Jaehn seems to have lifted the remix's texture directly from Graceland. Silentó, ""Watch Me"" (current: #3, peak: #3)   Cox: I must confess: I heard this song for the first time yesterday morning when I read the charts and headed to YouTube for it. I like when stuff like that happens, stuff that illustrates the power of the bubbles in which we can find ourselves or the thin lines between countries (this is not a very big hit in my Canadian home) — but I’m also embarrassed that I’m only getting around to the #3 song in the country now. This is a fun trifle, albeit one I can’t see myself returning to very often though I’m fascinated by the idea of music as dance move listicle. My favorite move is the Stanky Leg. Yoshida: I love dance songs — I mean, songs that are specifically tied to a dance routine. Love ‘em. Play me Webstar all day long. And yet, as infectious the joy is in the ""Watch Me"" video is, this song always feels about four times as long as it actually is. After the first few dances it begins to feel like a never-ending wedding reception Electric Slide. There’s nothing particularly memorable here, which is too bad, because it’s been a second since the dougie reared its head, and we’re definitely due for a new, wholly original dance craze. Taylor Swift ft. Kendrick Lamar, ""Bad Blood (Remix)"" (current: #4, peak: #1)   Cox: This is one of the worst songs on 1989, and no amount of Kendrick or enhanced percussive bits can change that fact. (What would Coco Chanel say, Taylor? Take one thing off before you leave the studio!) It’s much more interesting as a show of force — Taylor shoving her way onto the radio with a heavily promoted, starry, and ultimately boring video is more of a flex than an artistic statement, if you ask me. Ke$ha could’ve done this so much better. I wish ""Wildest Dreams"" was sitting in its place. Yoshida: Seconded, seconded, seconded. I’d take ""Wildest Dreams"" — heck, I’d take ""All You Had to Do Was Stay,"" secretly the most Max Martin-y song on all of 1989. How could a pop songwriting genius like Taylor give us such a clunky chorus? Words like ""pro-oblems,"" ""so-olve them,"" ""take a look what you do-o-one"" are stretched out awkwardly over this anticlimactic downward slope of a musical phrase. I’m not even talking about the Kendrick verse because I feel like the less I think about it, the more I can pretend it never happened. Fetty Wap, ""Trap Queen"" (current: #5, peak: #2)   Cox: And now for the people’s champion! I think ""Trap Queen"" is probably the most beloved of the songs on this list, and I still find it hard to believe it never managed to reach the top of the charts — such is the strength of Charlie Puth, I guess. I have to confess that Emily almost ruined this one for me when she revealed that Fetty throws all of that lovely talk about fidelity and building a life together in the trash at the very end of the song (""I'll run in ya house, then I'll fuck your ho""). I wanted very badly to believe in monogamous trap royalty! Yoshida: All spring / summer songs should start with the words ""I’m like hey, what’s up, hello."" It’s the perfect prompt to perk up your head and look around and realize the world isn’t a muddy frozen ice planet anymore. Yeah, this track is still pretty perfect, and I’ll remember it as 2015’s song of the summer even if it doesn’t land on the final top 10. Enough has been written about what a joy-inducing anthem this is — but recently I’ve been living for those AutoTuned ""yaaahhs,"" each one a second-long ""what else is there to say?"" victory lap for a song that’s already proven itself a classic by the first chorus. The Weeknd, ""Can’t Feel My Face"" (current: #6, peak: #6)   Cox: It crept up on us, but Abel Tesfaye is a major pop star now: four straight top 20 hits, three of which landed in the top 10, a run capped off by this Max Martin-assisted monster. I’m not surprised he got here — he’s like the male, Canadian Lana Del Rey, just a little more druggy and a little less emblematic of his home country. I like him a lot more in this uncompromising, unabashed pop mode than as a mysterious, shadowy R&B lech. There’s still a little bit of lecherousness here, of course, but he’s cutting it with that pure, sweet tenor and by picking up the pace. This sounds great on the highway at night. Yoshida: I appreciate Max Martin for picking up what could have been another flopped-on-the-floor Weeknd song, slapping its face and feeding it a shot of espresso. This doesn’t mean I love it — Jason Derulo’s ""Want to Want Me"" did it for me way more as far as MJ-indebted breezy male pop jams go, but it doesn’t make my skin crawl the way ""The Hills"" or his verse on Ariana Grande’s ""Love Me Harder"" did. (Maybe this makes me a total mom, but ""Earned It (Fifty Shades of Grey)"" is my favorite mainstream Weeknd hit by a wide margin.) Walk the Moon, ""Shut Up and Dance"" (current: #7, peak: #4)   Cox: I like this song because it pairs the guitar melody and tone of a peak U2 hit — seriously, The Edge must be owed royalties on this — with the intensity and tight, hooky blast of the finest mid-’00s power-pop-punk. I flash back to Cartel’s ""Luckie St."" hearing this, something that was on constant rotation in my bedroom c. 2006, and I can’t help but feel like the members of Walk the Moon might be a little bit familiar with that sound. (Or perhaps I’m just looking for an excuse to relive my bratty, halcyon teenage days.) Yoshida: I read somewhere that this is Ed Sheeran’s favorite song of the summer, which is about all you need to know. Skrillex and Diplo ft. Justin Bieber, ""Where Are U Now"" (current: #8, peak: #8)   Cox: Just two points to make about this one: this is the 2015’s best patio song by a country mile, and no one could’ve done a better job on this vocal than Justin Bieber. He smashed this. I like having Bieber around, and I will believe in his ability to one day release an excellent grown-up pop-R&B album until my dying breath. Yoshida: Oh, how I adore this song. Somehow it transcends the whiny Bieber penance tour lyrics and becomes something bigger, full of more wonder and melancholy than anything Justin’s done before. It’s summery as f-u-c-k, too — that perfectly balanced drop goes through multiple iterations of dancehall percussion and skittery hi-hats, as if Skrillex and Diplo are tossing it back and forth like a badminton birdie on a muggy August night. It’s built off perhaps the most overused chord progression in modern dance anthems, but that’s also what makes it feel charming and timeless. David Guetta ft. Nicki Minaj, Bebe Rexha, and Afrojack, ""Hey Mama"" (current: #9, peak: #8)   Cox: I want to support Nicki, someone I think is a great musician and a general force for good, but this song is execrable. Whenever I hear it, all I can think of are bad routines on So You Think You Can Dance. Imagine one of those terrible hip-hop routines where someone completely unfamiliar with the genre is clearly out of their depth — that’s the scene playing in my head when I listen to ""Hey Mama."" No more, please. Yoshida: I keep forgetting how this song goes, because every time I see the title my mind goes blank and suddenly I’m in 2004 with the Black Eyed Peas. This ""Hey Mama,"" however, will only ever remind me of the promos leading up to HBO’s Ballers. And unfortunately, I must dispense with the burn of burns: that the first time I heard this chorus, I thought it was Rita Ora. Rachel Platten, ""Fight Song"" (current: #10, peak: #10)   Cox: This taps into the the folky, inspirational MOR-pop vein Kelly Clarkson’s owned for the last decade, and I can’t argue with the commercial efficacy of that sound. I’d much prefer hearing someone like Clarkson doing the vocals here, though, someone with real power and a little grit — Platten isn’t bringing very much to the table. I don’t want to listen to this ever again, but I wouldn’t make fun of my mom for singing along to this in the car. Yoshida: Summer of 2015, why you gotta be so dramatic? Struggle-pop is so big this year, as evidenced by this, and the song that’s been at no. 1 for approximately 8,000 weeks. This song sounds like something that would play during a season finale of The Hills; I can totally see Audrina, having finally moved on with her life, finding one of Justin Bobby’s fedoras on her nightstand and storming outside to throw it into the ocean, then gazing at the sunset as it is drawn out by the tide and the camera floats up over the rocky cliffs of Malibu. Five years later, apparently, Rachel Platten has found that fedora, spiritually and — watch the video — literally. BONUS: Andy Grammer, ""Honey, I’m Good."" (current: #11, peak: #9)   Cox: I know many people who detest this song, and I can’t blame them. There's nothing special about some horny dude having to fight to stay faithful, and yet I find ""Honey, I’m Good."" touching and sweet. I'll try to explain: this is a bigger hit up here in Canada than it is in the US, and it’s been hanging around for a little longer. So I’ve heard this at bars, streaming from parties while walking around town, in the mall food court, everywhere. And every time I hear it, I see couples looking at each other and grinning the same dumb grin. It's one that says, ""This song is dumb, but this is how I feel; we’re going to make mistakes, but you’re the person I want to see at the end of the night."" When I hear ""Honey, I’m Good."" now, I keep coming back to those moments, ones where I could feel people's happiness radiating out and hitting me like ripples in a pond. The rational part of me says Grammer shouldn’t be asking for a medal just because he’s fulfilling the basic commitments that define a monogamous relationship, but try as I might, I’m not a rational listener most of the time — I’m a blob of instinct and experience and visceral reaction to sound. And ""Honey, I’m Good."" somehow puts a smile on that blob’s face. BONUS: Jamie xx ft. Young Thug and Popcaan, ""I Know There’s Gonna Be (Good Times)"" (current: NR, peak: NR)   Yoshida: You can get completely sick of a song — you’ve played it every day for a month, you’re positive you’ve drained the joy out of it and it no longer can surprise you anymore. And then you find yourself in a small town in North Carolina over Fourth of July weekend as some kids drive by on the deserted main street with the windows down — Jamie’s muted, bell-like beats and Young Thug’s hiccupy wail momentarily drowning out the whine of cicadas — and you’re back in love with it all over again. ""It was good, but we didn’t rave to it,"" says a voice at the tail end of the track. Maybe not, but ""Good Times"" is good as kickback music, and it’s clear this summer that’s what we’re in the mood for.",0.64303958544598,0.35696041455401994,0.17252818950995716,2705,4.5367837338262476,1221,5.9516789516789519,0,0,"Culture, Entertainment, Music",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

That's part of why HTC is beginning to tour its Vive VR headset around the US, bringing a truck loaded up with demo stations to a number of major cities and events to let gamers and non-gamers alike try it out. San Diego Comic-Con is HTC's first stop, and it's also using the opportunity to show off the latest version of Vive. It's the same version that HTC is now shipping out to developers, and it's been updated to include wireless controllers, rather than the wired ones that HTC showed off in March, when the headset was announced in partnership with Valve. Vive (rhymes with ""hive"") otherwise hasn't changed much: it's composed of a headset, two controllers, and a pair of laser-emitting trackers. The trackers allow Vive wearers to actually move in a small space throughout their room — a square around 10 feet by 10 feet in size — while exploring virtual space. Only being able to go so far is limiting, but it still opens up some impressive scenarios that you don't get from other VR headsets, like the Oculus Rift, that require you to more or less stay facing one direction. With the wires removed from Vive's controllers, the experience basically goes a small step further toward really making you feel free. The first time you walk up to a ledge and get scared believing that you could actually fall, you'll understand why adding real world movement is so powerful. HTC's demos are about more than gaming. In addition to just letting people experience VR, it wants to give people an understanding of what VR can be used for. One of Vive's demos lets you paint in 3D, quickly giving a pretty fantastical impression of what creating art could be like. Another demo is essentially an interactive short film by Valve that takes place within the Portal universe, showing how VR can be used for storytelling. One of the more interesting suggestions from this demo set is that virtual reality could be used for job training. A basic game puts you in the shoes of a chef; you're not about to learn from it, but it's easy to imagine a more thorough demo throwing you in the middle of a hot, loud, and bustling kitchen. You can find some addition details on Vive's demoes from our initial preview of the headset. My colleagues have already sung the praises of Vive, and I'm happy to add another voice to the choir. Putting the headset on was among of the most fun and engaging experiences I've had in a while, and I think a lot of people — especially people who aren't enthralled by most video games — will be surprised at how much they enjoy even the blocky 3D graphics that you end up staring at. If HTC's truck rolls up near you, find and hour and go see it. The schedule doesn't appear to be online yet, but HTC says it should be driving by Chicago, Kansas City, and Seattle for The International and PAX.

New posts made through Facebook Notes are wider, include a big cover image, and are presented with large clean text and a clear headline. ""We’re testing an update to Notes to make it easier for people to create and read longer-form stories on Facebook,"" a Facebook spokesperson tells The Verge. For now, the test only appears to be available to a small group of people.  Remember Notes? Remember Walls? Remember blogging? Facebook Notes has pretty much sat dormant for years. A while ago, Notes let Facebook users post blog-like entries on their Wall (back when Walls were a thing), but that hasn't really been necessary since Facebook started raising the character limit on statuses. Notes are still around, but you have to go a bit out of the way to make one; they also don't stand out very much from a normal status message. This update to Notes should make them a lot more prominent. Facebook is likely hoping to get people writing longer blog posts, which would be native to the site and presumably faster to load through its mobile apps. Though Medium already seems to be the platform of choice for journalists and many professionals in media and technology, Facebook has a huge built-in audience who may be eager for a new way to share their thoughts — and see them spread — through the site.

Similar documentation was filed for the original Moto 360 before it launched in September last year, and last week, leaked video of what appears to be a second-generation Moto 360 found its way online. All this suggests that Motorola could be preparing to launch a successor to the Moto 360 and that the next-gen Android Wear device will be available in two sizes rather than one.

Probably not Windows 10 launched nearly three weeks ago, and while millions of people are upgrading there have been a number of privacy concerns around the new OS. Default settings send information to Microsoft, enable bandwidth sharing to distribute updates to other Windows 10 users, and turn on a Wi-Fi password sharing feature. Mixed with Microsoft's forced automatic updates for Windows 10, a lot of the changes in this new free upgrade seem draconian at first glance. A lack of transparency from Microsoft has left privacy advocates wrestling the reality of the new features against the legal jargon hidden away in license agreements. The latest example of this is a fresh concern that Windows 10 will disable pirated games. A report surfaced at Alphr last week, noting that Microsoft has updated its services agreement that you agree to when you use certain Windows 10 apps. It's a document that nobody ever reads and you just agree to. This is an agreement that covers Microsoft's services and apps like Skype or Xbox Live that run on top of Windows 10, not an End User License Agreement (EULA) that covers Windows 10 itself. The agreement now includes the following: ""We may automatically check your version of the software and download software updates or configuration changes, including those that prevent you from accessing the Services, playing counterfeit games, or using unauthorized hardware peripheral devices."" If you assume this applies to Windows 10 then it sounds like Microsoft is going to constantly scan your PC to make sure you don't have any illegal copies of Call of Duty. The reality is probably very different as this applies primarily to the services powering Windows 10. This agreement applies to Xbox and Xbox Live, so it's safe to assume Microsoft will continue issuing Xbox software updates that block certain peripherals and pirated games. The software maker has been doing this for years on the Xbox side, and it's unlikely the company would transfer such a complex disc-based detection system over to the PC. This latest concern just highlights the complex nature of Windows 10 and a balance of legal requirements and product features. Windows 10 sharing your bandwidth to distribute updates in a BitTorrent-like fashion is something Microsoft should make clearer during installation, or just disable by default. On the other hand, the FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt) around a Wi-Fi Sense feature is unnecessary noise that's generated by people who don't understand that it's not sharing all of your Wi-Fi passwords by default as you have to manually opt into every Wi-Fi network that you want to share to friends. There are some genuine Windows 10 privacy concerns There should be concerns over some of Microsoft's policy wording and Windows 10 feature changes, though. Ars Technica's Peter Bright took the time to analyse the many privacy controls in Windows 10 that are designed to disable some of these controversial features that send data to Microsoft. Bright found that the controls ""don't appear to be sufficient to completely prevent the operating system from going online and communicating with Microsoft's servers."" If you disable Windows 10's new Cortana assistant, Microsoft will still send a request to bing.com with a random machine ID to download a file with some Cortana information. Elsewhere, Windows 10 seems to transmit information a server related to OneDrive even when the feature is disabled and logins are using a local account that isn't connected to a Microsoft Account. It's not clear what is being sent, but it's obvious that Microsoft needs to address this as transparently as possible. All of these changes in Windows 10, including baffling outrage over an ad-supported version of Solitaire that first debuted with Windows 8, are part of where Windows is headed. Windows 10 updates are being distributed weekly at the moment, and while that's a post-launch pace they're going to continue regularly. Microsoft is offering Windows 10 as a free upgrade, which also means the company has to find other ways to monetize Windows and tempt consumers into services and subscriptions.

Even so, black people with HIV are still more likely to die than whites or people of Hispanic descent — a finding that indicates a clear need for strategies that will ""further reduce disparities in deaths,"" the report's authors write. Black people living with HIV experienced higher numbers and rates of deaths The death rate per 1,000 black people living with HIV decreased by 28 percent between 2008 and 2012, according to the CDC statistics, published in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. That’s a big, positive change — one that’s bigger than the overall 22 percent decline in deaths per 1,000 people living with HIV during that same period. It's not all good news. The death rate among black people with HIV in the US remains greater than that of white people or Hispanics living with HIV. In 2012, for instance, 48 percent of people with HIV who died that year were black. Over 8,100 black people living with HIV died, compared with 5,400 deaths among white people, and 2,500 deaths among Hispanics and Latinos. These findings aren’t necessarily easy to interpret, however. The numbers presented in the report are ""all-cause mortality"" numbers, meaning that they aren’t strictly related to HIV. The report found that injection drug users have the highest death rates, so these numbers probably include events like overdoses. So today's statistics can’t be used to directly evaluate differences in the quality of care among various ethnicities, the authors write. Still, all-cause mortality is probably the best indicator to use given that HIV infection suppresses the immune system in ways that can result in cancer, or that can leave people vulnerable to various fatal infections. The fact that these disparities exist in the first place is still distressing The overall decline in mortality among people living with HIV is encouraging; the gap between ethnicities in the US appears to be narrowing. Yet the fact that these disparities exist in the first place is still distressing, especially given that non-Hispanic black people in the US are among the second largest group without health care. ""Efforts are needed to increase entry into and retention care of black persons living with diagnosed HIV,"" the authors write.

But Stephanie Messenger, author of Melanie's Marvelous Measles, feels we're being way too nervous about exposing our children to preventable illnesses that could make them wretchedly uncomfortable, blind, or dead. From her author information on Amazon: Melanie's Marvelous Measles was written to educate children on the  benefits of having measles and how you can heal from them naturally and  successfully. Often today, we are being bombarded with messages from  vested interests to fear all diseases in order for someone to sell some  potion or vaccine, when, in fact, history shows that in industrialized  countries, these diseases are quite benign and, according to natural  health sources, beneficial to the body. Having raised three children  vaccine-free and childhood disease-free, I have experienced many times  when my children's vaccinated peers succumb to the childhood diseases  they were vaccinated against. Surprisingly, there were times when my  unvaccinated children were blamed for their peers' sickness. My dad had measles as a kid; he was born before the push for vaccination started in 1963. Dad didn't have marvelous measles — he had miserable measles, and he didn't much enjoy the other childhood diseases he caught, either. I was, of course, vaccinated; my father didn't see why I should suffer, as he is a good father (full disclosure: we are related; my four younger siblings are also fully vaccinated). That puts my dad ahead of Stephanie Messenger and the other abusive parents who are willing to let their children risk death — and have other, vulnerable people risk infection — because they have been taken with the naturalistic fallacy. (By the way: arsenic is natural, but I'd hesitate before giving it to a kid.) Gotta hear both sides though!

Maybe they are. But I don't believe in evaluating actions based on intent; no drunk driver intends to run a child over, after all. And that's who those in denial of the benefits of vaccines are: drunk drivers, unable or unwilling to see that they're putting everyone else's lives at risk.

A new study out of Johns Hopkins University looks at e-cigarettes' effects on mice, and it finds that exposure to their vapor limited of the mice's immune systems and impaired their lungs' ability to fight off viral and bacterial infections. They also found that the vapor contained harmful molecules known as free radicals. The findings were published this week in the journal PLOS One.  ""They had more of the virus in their lungs."" The research team exposed the mice to e-cigarette vapor, from the commercial brand Njoy, for two weeks. They attempted to simulate human conditions by measuring the level of nicotine in the mice's blood and matching it with the levels that occur in human smokers. After two weeks of vapor exposure, some mice were exposed to pneumonia, other  mice were exposed to the flu, and others were left in fresh air. In  both cases with disease exposure, the mice had more trouble fighting  back: with pneumonia, the bacteria had an easier time multiplying; with  the flu, the mice lost more weight — some even died. ""We saw that they got sicker"" after disease exposure, Thomas Sussan, the paper's lead author and an assistant scientist at the Bloomberg School of Public Health, tells The Verge. ""They had more of the virus in their lungs, they had more inflammation in their lungs, [and] they were more susceptible to death."" The results suggest something in e-cigarette vapor is inhibiting the immune system within the mice's lungs, the researchers say. Though it's not clear what the cause is, one candidate is the free radicals the researchers detected in the vapor. These molecules are capable of damaging cells and DNA, and they're present in high levels in tobacco smoke. The researchers didn't expect to find them in e-cig vapor because there's no combustion involved, but it appears that just heating up e-cig liquid may be enough. ""We were actually surprised that we found quite a bit,"" Sussan says, ""but the levels were considerably lower than what you'd see in cigarette smoke."" Far lower — more than 100 times beneath cigarette levels. But what's impeding the mice's immune systems may be something else entirely. The researchers suggest that the culprit may be related to an additive in e-cig liquid called ""propylene glycol,"" which is also found in fog machines and seems to cause similar lung problems in people who work with them. This study, however, didn't investigate that link. Njoy declined to comment. ""They did work with one particular brand, one particular flavor, one particular level of nicotine,"" David Peyton, a chemist at Portland State University who was not involved with the study, tells The Verge. ""Critically, I would like to see this group follow up with no-nicotine e-cigarette fluid, I would like to see no flavoring at all, I would like to see ... the glycerine alone, and see what effects those have."" Though Peyton sees no problems with the study's protocols, its limited scope means that it's a starting point for a lot more research. ""As a scientist there are a whole host of question that this study opens up."" The study doesn't say if this is better or worse than cigarette smoke That type of uncertainty speaks to the general ambiguity in the current debate around e-cigarette safety and regulation. Though it's widely expected that they'll be less harmful than traditional cigarettes, it isn't clear what the risks will be — just because the technology is so new. That's led to much debate over how strictly e-cigarettes should be regulated: loose regulations could mean e-cigs being picked up by non-smokers, exposing them to harm, while strict restrictions could prevent smokers from switching to a less-harmful alternative. Sussan's team doesn't determine how the effects of e-cigarette vapor compare to the effects of traditional cigarette smoke, but their work does show that similar effects are present. ""I can't say that it's better or worse,"" Sussan says, ""but we see that same type of [immune] dysfunction."" In particular, the researchers say this may be cause for concern should a smoker who's developed a lung disease attempt to switch to e-cigarettes for safety, as that safety may not actually be there. Sussan notes that vaping activists often — rightly or otherwise — find fault with research into the effects of e-cigs. He believes that his research group has found a way around this by developing a more-realistic animal model. In fact, Sussan says, their model appears to be the first of its kind, with an animal being exposed to vapor in a way that actually simulates smoking. ""You can't really train mice to vape."" ""This type of exposure certainly has precedent in the tobacco research area, so it's got that kind of legitimacy around it,"" Peyton says. That said, ""You can't really train mice to vape,"" so there are always going to be some differences between this model and a human study. And Peyton thinks that this study may well find itself facing criticism — ""and perhaps unfairly so"" — simply because it doesn't look at how the effects of e-cigarette vapor compare to the effects of cigarette smoke. ""People will push back on it and say, 'you're saying that this is not supporting e-cigarettes as a cessation device,'"" he says. ""What they've done is compared e-cigarette vaping to non-vaping."" Chances are, we're going to see more use of animal models in the future. The debate around e-cigarettes' health effects isn't going to subside any time soon, and any model that gets results people view as realistic is likely to see some traction. ""Clearly this is the first study,"" Peyton says. ""There are a lot more [e-cig] systems that this group can do exactly the same study on but with a whole different series of devices to work on.

That may be because many of the women involved in the trial didn't take the medications they were assigned. Today's results illustrate how stigma and fear can waylay disease prevention trials. The trial, nicknamed  VOICE, for Vaginal and Oral Interventions to Control the Epidemic, tested HIV prevention strategies from September 2009 to August 2012 — though it had been planned to run longer, the trial was stopped for futility. There seemed to be no benefit, even though similar preventive tools have worked elsewhere. One way to prevent HIV from spreading in a high-risk setting is called  pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP. In the US, this is typically done  with a drug, such Gilead Sciences' Truvada, which a high-risk patient takes every day. The VOICE trial looked at use of Truvada or another Gilead Sciences drug, Viread. The  researchers also studied a vaginal gel formulation of the compound in  Viread. Even though the drugs' usefulness wasn't in question, they didn't seem to be working. ""It is well-established that medications don't work if they are not taken.""So the scientists used blood tests to see if women were using the product they'd been assigned; by three months into the trial, it was clear many women hadn't used any of their preventive medication at all, according to the study results reported in The New England Journal of Medicine. Those least likely to have used their medicine were single women under 25 — those who were at greatest risk. At some study sites, 10 of these women out of 100 were infected every year. ""It is well-established that medications don't work if they are not  taken, which probably explains why no difference in efficacy was  observed between the active-drug and placebo groups,"" writes Michael Saag, an HIV researcher at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, in a related editorial. even though the drugs worked, the human factors didn't In an ancillary study of random participants in VOICE, the  researchers found that the poor adherence may have been because people  didn't know if the products were effective, because the study drugs are  associated with HIV infection rather than prevention, or because of a  lack of social support. So even though the drugs worked, the human  factors didn't, Saag concludes. ""The study indicates that much more work is needed, not so much in  the  realm of understanding the biologic basis of pre-exposure  prophylaxis as a  preventive treatment but rather in the realm of  understanding  behavioral barriers in the setting of strong social  stigma,"" he writes. The HIV epidemic in Sub-Saharan Africa is the worst in the world, according to UK charity Avert; there, 25 million people are infected. About 60 percent of people with HIV in Sub-Saharan Africa are female, and sexual intercourse is the main way people are infected. Though condoms would protect these women, many can't insist on condom use. most women said they were using the treatments, even though blood tests showed otherwise Fewer than 40 percent of the samples taken three months into the trial showed any level of the assigned study drugs. Most of these women didn't have positive samples later, either. But most women — 88 percent to 90 percent —said they were using the treatments, even though blood tests showed otherwise. And women went to great lengths to pretend they were taking their pills, bringing back medicine for a practice called ""reconciliation,"" where researchers count unused pills. In that process, 86 percent of medicine was ""taken,"" though again, that didn't match with the blood plasma samples. ""This means that a large number of participants  actively removed unused medications from their allotment before  returning to the study site in order to create the appearance of  compliance with the protocol,"" Saag writes. ""The question that emerges is this: why did the participants  go to such lengths to create the appearance that they were taking  medications when they were not?"" One researcher told The New York Times that study participants lied because they were scared — they'd heard rumors the drugs would cause liver damage or hurt their reproductive organs. To compound the issue, the women were paid $10 to $15 per clinic visit, valuable income even if the would-be participants didn't actually intend to participate. The study results may not mean much for HIV treatment, but they've changed how studies are run. Now, participants' blood tests are run immediately, rather than stored for later.",0.2882756604977581,0.7117243395022419,0.8577917271056575,787,4.9745870393900891,386,6.0181347150259068,0,0,Science,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

But vaccination rates among US adults are low for the most routine shots, according to a report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Today's report from the CDC, published in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, looked at the lifetime use of six common vaccines among adults in 2013. The US has goals for use of three vaccines — pneumococcal disease, shingles, and hepatitis B — in its Healthy People 2020 documents. Several federal agencies, including the Department of Health and Human Services, the CDC and the Food and Drug Administration, collaborate on Healthy People planning documents every 10 years; the first goals were set in 1979. The figures from 2013 show that the US is falling short on those objectives. the us is falling short on its health objectives By 2020, health officials want 90 percent of people who are older than 65 to receive the pneumococcal disease vaccine, but the figures from 2013 show that only about 60 percent of that group got their shots. The pneumococcal disease jab is also recommended for high-risk patients who are 18 through 64 — so for anyone with an impaired immune system, and also for people with some health conditions, including heart disease, sickle cell disease, and diabetes. The government goals in that group are to have 60 percent of these younger adults vaccinated in 2020; in 2013, only 20 percent actually received injections. And it wasn't just pneumococcal vaccine, either. Take hepatitis B: the government goal is to have 90 percent of adults immunized in 2020; only a quarter of adults were actually vaccinated in 2013. And then there's shingles, a painful condition wherein the virus that causes chickenpox reactivates in a person's body, causing a blistering rash.  The goal for 2020 is for 30 percent of adults over the age of 60 to get  a jab to protect them from shingles; in 2013, a quarter of that age group  got the shot.   Aside from flu shots — which every adult should get every year —   vaccines in adults are usually recommended depending on an individual   patient's risk factors. Those include a person's age, certain health   conditions, occupation, travel, and some behavioral risks, like   injection drug use. many adults don't realize they need vaccines too In response to the figures, the report's authors make some recommendations. More doctors should be assessing whether patients need certain shots and assessing the level of patient vaccinations among doctors who share a practice. Many people don't realize they need vaccines as adults, so they should be educated, the authors write. Narrowing health disparities between the races — whites are most likely to be vaccinated — is also a crucial issue; some people don't get vaccinated because they don't have access to doctors. Separately in the MMWR, the CDC updated its recommendations for children and adults. The recommendations for children ages 18 and younger contained some minor changes to language, without changing the recommended vaccines or sequence. In adults, the CDC recommended that everyone 65 and older receive a version of the pneumococcal disease vaccine; previously, it had only been recommended for high-risk groups.",0.4403708203071008,0.5596291796928992,0.5573972374555397,554,5.0306859205776178,272,6.0147058823529411,0,0,Science,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The new therapy combines deep brain stimulation (DBS) with a drug treatment to normalize brain behavior in cocaine-addled mice, raising the possibility that similar approaches could one day be used to treat addiction in humans. Researchers ran a series of four experiments using deep brain stimulation and a drug that blocks receptors for dopamine, a chemical messenger known for its involvement in addiction. Each experiment involved 60 to 80 mice, some of which were injected with cocaine; scientists monitored their behavior as they withdrew from the drug. Cocaine has been shown to make mice hyperactive, and a form of hyperactivity called locomotor sensitivity is used as a measure of how vulnerable mice are to addiction and relapse. In this study, locomotor sensitivity was determined after a ""cocaine challenge,"" where scientists measured the distance each mouse ran through a circular corridor 10 days after injection. ""You need to know exactly what you need to achieve."" There was a point to all this. The aim of the study, published in Science, was to see if it was possible to develop a kind of deep brain stimulation to treat addiction; mice are the first step. The technique requires electrodes to be implanted in certain spots in the brain; then, they can be stimulated using a pacemaker-like device implanted under the skin. DBS is already used in humans — Medtronic’s device Activa is approved in both the US and Europe for treating symptoms of Parkinson’s and has been used by more than 100,000 people — but finding the right targets to jolt, as well as the right ""dosage"" of electricity is crucial. That’s where the mice come in. Today’s study measured two frequencies of stimulation in the cocaine challenge. Scientists found that high-frequency DBS (130 Hz) suppressed the mice’s hyperactivity only temporarily, but low-frequency DBS (12 Hz), combined with a synthetic compound that blocks some dopamine receptors, made the mice behave normally. The study’s authors say they sought to develop a modified form of DBS therapy that would mimic the effects of optogenetic treatments, which allow scientists to control neurons with light. Optogenetics has shown promise as a potential treatment for cocaine and alcohol addiction, but the techniques remain too risky to test on humans. Optogenetics is widely used in mice, which are genetically engineered to have certain neurons with light-sensitive proteins. These proteins, called opsins, make the neurons fire when a scientist shines a laser beam on them. Though optogenetics has made the jump to other primates, figuring out how to implant opsins isn’t easy. So neuroscience professor Christian Luescher and his colleagues at the University of Geneva decided to mimic the effect with existing technology: deep brain stimulation. Previous studies have examined the potential for DBS to cure addiction, but the disease is highly complex, and there’s still uncertainty over which parts of the brain to target with electric stimulation. Experts say new therapy is ""promising."" ""What we would like to argue is you need a strong rationale,"" says Luescher, one of the study’s authors. ""You need to know exactly what you need to achieve if you want to have a successful new therapy and a new indication for DBS."" In their study, Luescher and his colleagues found that when applied on their own, neither low-frequency DBS nor the synthetic compound, SCH 23390, had any effect on the cocaine-related behavior of the mice. When they were used together, though, the mice began behaving more normally within 24 hours. Michael Stefanik, an postdoctoral research associate at Rosalind Franklin University, describes the findings as ""promising,"" though he says more work is needed to determine whether it could have meaningful implications for drug addicts. ""Addiction is certainly much more complex than one behavior model that they’re using to present here,"" says Stefanik, who co-authored a paper on optogenetics and cocaine addiction, and was not involved in today’s study. ""When you look at addiction as a whole, it’s really heterogeneous in terms of brain regions, in terms of the cells that are involved. The model is informative... but it doesn’t model all aspects of an addict’s life."" There’s also the formidable challenge of applying the technique to humans, whose brains are of course far more complex than those of mice. That caveat alone draws sharper skepticism from other experts. ""I wish I had one dollar for every animal study that promised to lead to a breakthrough treatment."" ""I wish I had one dollar for every animal study that promised to lead to a breakthrough treatment for addiction [and] hasn't,"" Wayne Hall, a professor at the University of Queensland in Australia, said in an email. Hall, who has raised concerns over testing DBS on drug addicts in the past, also questions the long-term effectiveness of the therapy described in today’s study. ""Addicted individuals cannot get access to less expensive treatments that work now,"" he adds. ""Why waste money developing an even more expensive one that almost no one will... be able to use?"" Luescher acknowledges the limitations of his study and concedes that DBS is still far from mainstream. But he believes the therapy put forth today could nevertheless mark an important first step in treating addiction at its source. ""It’s not going to be a treatment for the masses, because it’s expensive and it’s quite challenging,"" he says. ""You need a surgeon, you need a neurologist... these [DBS implants] are not cheap. But for some people, this may really be the solution.""",0.4122047193742382,0.5877952806257618,0.4735196061746294,943,5.2608695652173916,476,6.6785714285714288,0,0,"Science, Report",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The new research overturns the previous understanding of these vocalizations as essentially fixed. ""As far as we know, this is the first evidence we've seen of a referential call being modified,"" says Simon Townsend, lead author of the paper published in the journal Current Biology and head of the University of Zurich's animal communication group. ""This suggests that the way meaning is assigned in human language and in animals might be more similar than previously thought."" The chimpanzees' vocalizations expressed their feelings on apples Scientists observed the change during the integration of two groups of adult chimpanzees in 2010. Seven individuals from Beekse Bergen Safari Park in the Netherlands were moved in with six residents of Edinburgh Zoo in the UK, something that would be extremely unlikely to occur in the wild since the primates tend to be territorial. Researchers took advantage of this rare event to record the grunts of the two groups in response to an item of food before and after the move. In this case the item was an apple, and one group of chimps liked the fruit better than the other. ""The Edinburgh chimps didn’t really like apples and gave noisy, rough grunts when they ate them,"" says Townsend. ""But the other group [from the Netherlands] really liked them and were happier when they ate them, producing high-pitched, excited, happier sounds.""  After the social integration was complete — that took a year or so — the immigrant group of chimps changed their vocalization to mimic the lower, rougher grunts of their hosts. Despite this change in vocalization, though, the Dutch chimps' enjoyment of apples remained the same — a fact established using simple preference tests where the chimps were offered a selection of food to choose from. the study shows the chimps' vocalizations are more than just automatic responses This last fact is what makes the observations so significant, says Jacob Dunn of the University of Cambridge, a researcher in primate communication. Though previous research has shown that calls can be modified, today's study suggests that the meaning behind the vocalizations has been made abstract in some way and divorced from the animal's emotional reaction, Dunn says. ""It's not something entirely novel or new,"" Dunn told The Verge. ""But it definitely takes a step forward in what we know and brings further evidence to show that primates are probably more flexible than we imagine.""",0.5352310452515295,0.46476895474847046,0.835273179308308,435,5.1540229885057469,253,6.0948616600790517,0,0,Science,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

On the Announcements subreddit, Huffman noted several kinds of content that would be banned under the new rules, which aren't yet final. Most of this was already forbidden in the current user agreement — including personal information, anything that ""incites harm or violence,"" content that is itself illegal (instead of just discussing something illegal), and sexually suggestive pictures of minors. There's also a clause that looks similar to what Ellen Pao introduced earlier, banning ""anything that harasses, bullies, or abuses an individual or group of people (these behaviors intimidate others into silence)."" It sounds like Reddit is putting a little more emphasis on cracking down on things that could hurt other community members, but that's going to require a change in actual admin behavior, not just wording. ""Inciting harm,"" for instance, is open to interpretation. ""I think we have an intuitive sense of what this means (e.g. death threats, inciting rape), but before we release an official update to our policy we will spell this out as precisely as possible,"" said Huffman in response to a question. Huffman also acknowledged that part of the problem is Reddit's overall hesitance to apply the rules that already exist, including those against incitement and harassment. ""This isn't different from what we have right now, but we really need to enforce it better,"" he told one Redditor. ""Content that violates a common sense of decency"" will become a little harder to find In practice, it looks like Reddit will alternate between shutting down the worst subreddits and trying to quarantine them. In addition to existing warnings for NSFW content, there's a new section for ""content that violates a common sense of decency,"" apparently a catch-all term for all the worst parts of Reddit. This will be allowed to stay up, but users will have to log in to see it, won't appear in search results, and ""will generate no revenue for Reddit."" Huffman gave one example of the difference between incitement and violating common decency. ""/r/rapingwomen will be banned. They are encouraging people to rape,"" he said, of one of Reddit's more controversial boards. But a white supremacist subreddit that doesn't actively incite violence could stay up. That's apparently the case with one of the site's most infamous racist communities. ""/r/coontown will be reclassified. The content there is offensive to many, but does not violate our current rules for banning."" In his justification, Huffman spoke of letting people form communities around offensive ideas but keeping those communities off ""mainstream"" Reddit. No company is perfect at addressing these hard issues. We've spent the last few days here discussing and agree that an approach like this allows us as a company to repudiate content we don't want to associate with the business, but gives individuals freedom to consume it if they choose. This is what we will try, and if the hateful users continue to spill out into mainstream Reddit, we will try more aggressive approaches. Freedom of expression is important to us, but it's more important to us that we at reddit be true to our mission. This is going to be complicated. One user asked how Reddit would decide when a whole subreddit, not just a few bad members, would qualify for banning. Huffman said he wouldn't enforce the new policy until he'd given moderators more tools to actually manage their subreddits, something that several members of Reddit leadership have previously promised. ""The concept of free speech is important to us, but completely unfettered free speech can cause harm to others."" He also answered questions about the conflicting ways that Reddit has talked about its purpose. In a recent post, Huffman said the site wasn't created as a ""bastion of free speech,"" but fellow co-founder Alexis Ohanian referred to it with those exact words in 2012. ""The common wording is unfortunate,"" he said. ""The concept of free speech is important to us, but completely unfettered free speech can cause harm to others and additionally silence others, which is what we'll continue to address."" Huffman stepped up last week to replace interim CEO Ellen Pao, who replaced previous CEO Yishan Wong in November of 2014. While Wong took a hands-off approach to the site, Pao instituted an unpopular anti-harassment policy and banned five subreddits for flouting it. She resigned earlier in July after a week of chaos over the firing of communications director Victoria Taylor and long-building tension between moderators and the site's administrators. The exact circumstances of Taylor's firing remain conflicted. There's no specific date for when the rules might go into force, and they'll likely be rewritten before then. They're also only part of the solution — Reddit also needs to rebuild its relationship with moderators and hire paid employees (like Taylor) to work with them. But whether or not the policy helps Reddit, it's at least broader and more comprehensive the slapdash attempts at change we've seen so far.",0.5096813262380239,0.49031867376197613,0.34918209578810044,844,5.1658767772511851,467,6.3576017130620981,0,0,"Culture, Web",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Last month, Google engineers showed off their ""Deep Dream,"" software capable of taking an image and ascertaining what was in it by turning it into a nightmare fusion of flesh and tentacles. The release follows research by scientists from Stanford University, who developed a similar program called NeuralTalk, capable of analyzing images and describing them with eerily accurate sentences. First published last year, the program and the accompanying study is the work of Fei-Fei Li, director of the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, and Andrej Karpathy, a graduate student. Their software is capable of looking at pictures of complex scenes and identifying exactly what's happening. A picture of a man in a black shirt playing guitar, for example, is picked out as ""man in black shirt is playing guitar,"" while pictures of a black-and-white dog jumping over a bar, a man in a blue wetsuit surfing a wave, and little girl eating cake are also correctly described with a single sentence. In several cases, it's unnervingly accurate. A computer just captioned this as ""man using his laptop while his cat looks at the screen"" http://t.co/bfwr1wiiFn pic.twitter.com/1F18NCwVf9  Like Google's Deep Dream, the software uses a neural network to work out what's going on in each picture, comparing parts of the image to those it's already seen and describing them as humans would. Neural networks are designed to be like human brains, and they work a little like children. Once they've been taught the basics of our world — that's what a window usually looks like, that's what a table usually looks like, that's what a cat who's trying to eat a cheeseburger looks like — then they can apply that understanding to other pictures and video.   It's still not perfect. A fully-grown woman gingerly holding a huge donut is tagged as ""a little girl holding a blow dryer next to her head,"" while an inquisitive giraffe is mislabeled as a dog looking out of a window. A cheerful couple in a garden with a birthday cake appears under the heading ""a man in a green shirt is standing next to an elephant,"" with a bush starring as the elephant and, weirdly, the cake standing in for the man. But in most cases, these descriptions are secondary guesses — alongside the elephant suggestion, the program also correctly identifies the cake couple as ""a woman standing outside holding a coconut cake with a man looking on."" The software easily identifies a dog jumping over a bar The incredible amount of visual information on the internet has, until recently, had to be manually labeled in order for it to be searchable. When Google first built Google Maps, it relied on a team of employees to dig through and check every single entry, humans given the task of looking at every number captured in the world to make sure it denoted a real address. When they were done, and sick of the tiresome job, they built Google Brain. Where it had previously taken a team weeks of work to complete the task, Google Brain could transcribe all of the Street View data from France in under an hour. ""I consider the pixel data in images and video to be the dark matter of the Internet,"" Li told The New York Times last year. ""We are now starting to illuminate it."" Leading the charge for that illumination are web giants such as Facebook and Google, who are keen to categorize the millions of pictures and search results they need to sift through. Previous research focused on single object recognition — in a 2012 Google study, a computer taught itself to recognize a cat — but computer scientists have said this misses the bigger picture. ""We've focused on objects, and we've ignored verbs,"" Ali Farhadi, computer scientist at the University of Washington, told The New York Times.   But more recent programs have focused on more complex strings of data in an attempt trying to teach computers what's happening in a picture rather than simply what's in shot. The Stanford scientists' study uses the kind of natural language we could eventually use to search through image repositories, leading to an easy hypothetical situation where rather than scanning through tens of thousands of family photos, services such as Google Photos can quickly pull up ""the one where the dog is jumping on the couch,"" or ""the selfie I took in Times Square."" Search results, too, would benefit from the technology, potentially allowing you to search YouTube or Google for the exact scenes you want, rather than simply finding the pictures or videos their uploaders were mindful enough to correctly label. Neural networks have potential applications out in the real world, too. At CES this year, Nvidia's Jen-Hsun Huang announced his company's Drive PX, a ""supercomputer"" for your car that incorporated ""deep neural network computer vision."" Using the same learning techniques as other neural networks, Huang said the technology will be able to automatically spot hazards as you drive, warning you of pedestrians, signs, ambulances, and other objects that it's learned about. The neural network means the Drive PX won't need to have reference images for every kind of car — if it's got four wheels like a car, a grille like a car, and a windscreen like a car, it's probably a car. Larger cars could be SUVs, while cars with lights on top could be police vehicles. Huang's company has been chasing this technology for a while, too, having provided the graphics processing units actually used by the Stanford team.   As the technology to automatically work out what's happening in images is progressing rapidly, its leaders are making their efforts available to all on code repositories such as GitHub. Google's Deep Dream, in particular, has captured the imagination of many with its trippy visual side effects, contorting images into the shapes of dogs and slugs as it attempts to find reference points it understands. But the proliferation of this machine learning has a creepy side too — if your computer can work out exactly what's happening in your pictures, what happens when it works out exactly what you are?",0.5221363030216568,0.4778636969783432,0.7548743055190404,1049,4.9408960915157296,531,6.256120527306968,0,6,"Culture, Google, Tech, Web, Report",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The $100 million fine is the largest ever administered under the Clean Air Act, the landmark 1970 law that requires the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to regulate air pollution nationwide.  overstating gas mileage and understating emissions The EPA found the violations in some of its routine tests of 2012 model Hyundai and Kia cars. After that, the agency conducted further tests, leading it and the Justice Department to filing a complaint. It accuses the automakers of overstating gas mileage by one-to-six miles and understating emissions on six different 2012-2013 car lines total: the Hyundai Accent, Elantra, Veloster and Santa Fe; and the Kia Rio and Soul. As the EPA acknowledges, that includes the majority of the automakers' vehicles for these model years. Not only did Hyundai and Kia's own tests produce inaccurately higher gas mileage and lower emissions, but the companies deliberately chose the most favorable results. In total, the government estimates that Kia and Hyundai's cited cars will produce 4.75 million metric tons more greenhouse gas emissions over their vehicle lifetimes than the companies originally reported. These cars aren't being recalled, nor discontinued or tweaked in any way, but the companies are publishing updated, correct mileage and emissions estimates, which means that dealers will have to relabel all the affected 2012-2013 cars on their lots. The government is also imposing stricter measures on Hyundai and Kia for the near future. The companies have agreed to revamp their own internal emissions testing groups to prevent violations in upcoming vehicle lines. They've further agreed to have their 2015 and 2016 car models audited. While none of that is going to fix the additional pollution that's coming from the offending vehicles on the roads now, it does send a clear warning sign to automakers that the government can and will force them to pay for environmental lapses.",0.3274719759306483,0.6725280240693516,0.8203233066441071,357,5.3137254901960782,209,5.9904306220095691,0,0,"Policy & Law, Transportation, US & World",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

A second pilot was evacuated to a hospital. It's not clear why the crash occurred. SpaceShipTwo had been undergoing testing ahead of commercial flights. The spacecraft launches from the belly of the larger WhiteKnightTwo, once that cargo aircraft has reached cruising altitude similar to a normal airplane. Once SpaceShipTwo separates, it functions as a glider with a rocket motor. WhiteKnightTwo's takeoff occurred at 9:20 a.m. local time; SpaceShipTwo was released at 10:10. At 10:12, the ground crew became aware of an ""inflight anomaly."" ""From my eyes and my ears, I detected nothing abnormal,"" said Stuart Witt, the chief executive officer of the Mojave Air and Space Port, where Virgin Galactic operates. ""I didn't detect anything other than a pause. It wasn't what did happen, it was what didn't I see or hear. If there was an explosion, I didn't see it."" Parabolicarc.com, which had been livetweeting the flight, reports that SpaceShipTwo ""came down in pieces"" after exploding in mid-air.   #SpaceShipTwo (N339SS) lost during test flight; two crew reportedly ejected. pic.twitter.com/IZgzxAhjk1    Witt had been briefed to expect that the plume from the rocket engines would look  slightly different, because the fuel had been changed, he said. In May, Virgin Galactic announced it was changing the type of solid fuel it was using to avoid engine  instabilities. The required qualification tests for the switch continued  until about a month before today and this was the first test using the new fuel. The engine had also been changed, and this was its fourth flight, according to Kevin Mickey, the president of Scaled Composites. Scaled Composites is the aerospace company that built the spacecraft and employed the test pilots. The families of the test pilots have been notified, Mickey said. The names of the pilots have not yet been released. Richard Branson, founder of the Virgin Group, is scheduled to arrive in Mojave on Saturday morning, as will the National Transportation Safety Board. This has been a bad week for aerospace companies. On Oct. 28, Orbital Sciences Corp.'s Antares rocket exploded shortly after liftoff during a resupply mission to the International Space Station. No one was aboard the ship, and no one was injured. Today's accident, however, was in a vehicle designed to carry people rather than just cargo. Here's an earlier tweet, showing WhiteKnightTwo paired with SpaceShipTwo on the tarmac:    The last test of SpaceShipTwo was in January this year, when the spaceship went supersonic, according to CNET. The ship is built for short trips meant to offer a few moments of weightlessness. The wait list for a flight includes Ashton Kutcher and Lady Gaga, according to Space.com, as well as 700 other people. Despite the grim week, Mojave's Witt enjoined the international community not to abandon space. ""This is not easy. If it were easy, it would not be interesting,"" he said. ""It hasn't been an easy week, it's been a challenge. But where I'm from, this is where you find out your true character."" Veteran space reporter Adam Rogers disagrees with this assessment. SpaceShipTwo is ""not a vehicle for the exploration of  frontiers. This would be true even if Virgin Galactic did more than  barely brush up against the bottom of space,"" he writes at Wired, in an editorial entitled ""Space Tourism Isn't Worth Dying For."" ""Virgin Galactic is building  the world’s most expensive roller coaster, the aerospace version of  Beluga caviar.

Surveys of Flickr users showed that they wanted an easier way to create photo books, Hughes says — oftentimes they would start building one using another service and abandon it before finishing. ""We try to take a different approach."" Starting today, hovering over a photo set on the web version of Flickr will cause a book icon to pop up; click it, and you enter the Photo Book workflow.

Flickr will crop and center your photos using its own algorithms, and you can adjust its selections if you'd prefer a different cropping.

The books start at $34.95 for a 20-page book and can grow as large as 240 pages, with each additional page costing 50 cents. (Apple's photo books start at $29.99 but cost 99 cents for each additional page.) Books will arrive in five to seven days after ordering; for now, shipping is available only in the United States. Since it started giving everyone 1 terabyte of free storage, Yahoo says daily Flickr uploads have increased up to seven times.

You can think of this as the manual for the crazy prototype shown off by the Korean company at CES in January. It seemed outlandish then, and still has to prove its viability for a lot of people today, but that wraparound display is very much in Samsung's plans for next year. A Bloomberg report said as much last week, plus the company's 2013 Analyst Day has already committed it to ""bended"" smartphone displays sometime in 2014 or 2015. The distinguishing feature in Samsung's nomenclature between a curved display, such as on the Galaxy Round, and a so-called bended one appears to be in the severity of the curve. This slide from its recent presentation shows the hierarchy from curved to bended to flexible displays. Back in January, we only saw a glimpse of the potential uses of a side-screen on your phone, but Samsung's present submission to the US Patent Office is far more detailed and rigorous. Just how useful any of these applications will be, however, must remain a question until they make the transition from paper to a bended reality.  Starting at the beginning, Samsung reimagines the slide-to-unlock gesture as a side-mounted experience. One of Samsung's proposed usage scenarios is to push chapter markers and bookmarks off the main screen when reading ebooks. Samsung envisions using the extra real estate on the side to provide information about email attachments. A cute and highly visual way to check if your phone's fully charged: the side-screen would display a bar representation of the handset's charged state. This would be a good match with Samsung's AMOLED displays, which only turn on the pixels that need to display something, making it a power-efficient solution. As with the majority of other applications, Samsung's contact book concept pushes the organizational aspects of the UI literally off to the side, cleaning up the main display.  The Galaxy Note 3 brought a major overhaul to Samsung's software for clipping and sharing content from the web, and that emphasis is apparent in the new patent application. It details a visual clipboard that lets you stash one or more images on the side panel and then reuse them in things like chat apps. While the main screen displays a conventional gallery overview, its sidecar can serve as a category sorter — scrolling through such things as event dates. If unlocking your phone with a slide is too conventional, Samsung will also let you do it by placing two fingers on particular areas of the side screen.

Starting in March 2014, all new buildings erected in the city will have to include lever handles on their doors rather than rounded knobs, thanks to a bylaw passed in late September to make Vancouver's housing more accessible to all. According to the American Center for Independence of Individuals with Disabilities, doorknobs are a potential barrier of entry for people with disabilities or dexterity issues that the city of Vancouver is evidently keen to remove. Speaking to The Vancouver Sun, Tim Stainton — professor and director of Social Work at the University of British Columbia — explained how the ban showed Vancouver's focus on universal design. ""The old model was adapted design,"" says Stainton. ""You took a space and you adapted for use of the person with a disability. What universal design says... is let's just build everything so it is as usable by the largest segments of the population as possible."" Rounded doorknobs are a potential barrier of entry for people with disabilities or dexterity issues The same September bylaw that banned knobs also introduced construction restrictions that forces new buildings to have lower light switches, wider hallways, and adaptable showers. These local-level restrictions are possible because the Canadian city is the only in the country with the ability to set its own building codes. For now, Vancouver's ban only applies to door hardware in new buildings, meaning residents with existing knobs need not worry about replacing them. But as The Vancouver Sun notes, the city's practices often influence the rest of the country's building codes, meaning an end to the rounded Canadian doorknob could soon be nigh.",0.6972923114956627,0.30270768850433727,0.8502022756661844,273,5.2564102564102564,176,5.9147727272727275,0,0,"Design, US & World",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Mercedes-Benz is first to take part in this Vision Gran Turismo project, introducing the audaciously styled concept supercar you see before you. Carrying the company's AMG designation, it's designed to evoke the sense of a predator poised to strike — and its aggressive combination of a low, streamlined body with oversized wheel arches and LED-illuminated grille certainly gets that point across.

Polyphony CEO Kazunori Yamauchi challenged carmakers to design their rendition — or vision — of what the words ""Gran Turismo"" mean to them. The response has been overwhelming, with everyone from Alfa Romeo to Zagato signing up for the opportunity, plus design houses from outside the car industry, such as Nike and its Jordan Brand subsidiary.

To get together for collaboration and conversation, we arrange conference calls. Unfortunately, conference calls are hell, as depicted in this YouTube video. The reason it has over 8 million views is that it’s painfully, hilariously true.  Today a startup called Highfive is unveiling its solution, a $799 gadget that hopes to do for the speakerphone what Nest did for the thermostat. It’s an HD video camera with a four-piece microphone array that connects to any screen with an HDMI input. It’s paired with a modern software package that makes organizing and joining a meeting feel less like the mental equivalent of walking over hot coals. The goal is a mass-market solution that can carve off a big slice of the $3 billion Cisco and Polycom rake in each year selling teleconferencing machines. ""It would be amazing to imbue this category with a little bit of sexiness,"" says CEO Shan Sinha.  Why are conference calls so universally hellish? That was the question Sinha asked himself two years ago when he left Google, where he ran the company’s enterprise apps division. ""It turns out that in 2014 the technology we’re using to get a group of people connected and talking to one another is 25 years old. You got a screen and speakerphone that was invented in the 1990s, before the internet was a thing, before Wi-Fi was a thing, before mobile devices,"" he says. Along with Jeremy Roy, who ran engineering on Google+ for enterprise, Shan founded Highfive, raising $13.4 million dollars from A-list names like Marc Benioff, Aaron Levie, Drew Houston, General Catalyst, Google Ventures, and Andreessen Horowitz. They have been building the product and testing it with select customers for two years leading up to today’s public launch. The technology we're using is more than two decades old The hardware is comprised of a compact black box between two aluminum wings — kind of a miniature starfighter in appearance — that sits atop a flat-screen or mounts on the wall. I experienced a live demo of a call between New York and California and the picture it delivers is a lot nicer than what you would get with your standard webcam. A lot of my frustration during conference calls comes from people talking over one another because of audio lag, or remote callers getting muted and speaking into the void for minutes before they realize what’s going on. Highfive’s most obvious solution to this is making it cheap and easy enough to always opt for  a visual. ""It’s about replacing the audio call with the video call,"" says Shan. In fact, at launch, there’s no audio-only mode at all. Clothing is no longer optional for that 8AM meeting.  Like Google Hangouts, Highfive detects who the active speaker is and puts them on-screen for everyone to see. To ensure that everyone in a large office can be heard, the microphone array targets whoever is talking. ""It can detect who’s speaking within 30 feet, locks onto that person, and cancels out background noise,"" says Dave King, the company’s head of marketing. During the live demo four people in a large room talked to a unit about 10 feet away without anyone on the other end having trouble hearing us. The lag was minimal enough that our conversation felt seamless and natural, although that will inevitably depend a lot on the quality of your connection and the ability of Highfive to scale its cloud to meet demand. The code you entered was not correctThe other half of Highfive is the software. There have been many nightmarish meetings where I sat down at a speakerphone and watched the organizer input the host code time and again, only to be told the digits she pressed were wrong. That’s a different form of torture from arriving to a meeting and realizing that no one in the room has the host code, which sends us scrambling like blind ducklings to find someone with the authority to get a meeting going.  Clicking a calendar link from your mobile phone and being asked to enter two different nine-digit codes to locate and access your meeting is a separate circle of hell. With Highfive, the meeting is a simple link. Click it to launch the mobile app or open a tab on your desktop browser. Purchasing the unit gives you unlimited audio, video, and screen sharing with up to 10 people for free. (For more advanced features and town hall services that a larger company would require, the cost is $10 per active user per month.) There are no access, host, or participant codes. In fact much of the traditional meeting hierarchy is stripped away, replaced with a perhaps naive faith in basic human decency and decorum. ""It works the way we do in real life.""""There is no concept of a presenter or a participant, you just join a conversation,"" says Sinha. If somebody is presenting and you want to show them an alternative, you just click a button and it will take over the screen from the other person, ""What’s unique about that is, it works the way we do on real life. If somebody is up at the whiteboard, you’re not gonna just walk up to them and snatch the pen out of their hand."" Highfive trusts you to telegraph your intentions and coordinate who is owning the screen. The best part of the demo was the way the mobile app uses Bluetooth LE, not to connect, but simply to detect nearby Highfive units. It then prompts you to throw the meeting from your device to the big screen. You can then initiate a presentation from that device with a tap, no wires needed. This is much simpler than having to be on the same Wi-Fi network, which might not be easy if you’re presenting while traveling or in a space with private and guest networks. Bluetooth LE also means that, if you need to pick up and change rooms because a meeting ran late, you could keep the call going on your smartphone and then toss it to a different screen (with a Highfive) after you switched locations. The only drawback is that not every laptop has Bluetooth yet, in which case you need to manually enter the URL of the unit you want to pair with. When I met up with the Highfive guys, I had actually just been through a grating conference call. Using the device felt like breaking into the near future. That’s probably not surprising given Sinha’s pedigree. ""I saw a vision of what is possible first­hand at Google,"" he told me. Every conference room has a video system. No more conference calls. No more projectors. ""Google did this for 4,000 conference rooms and 40,000 people and it completely transformed the way we communicated."" ""They spent $100 million on Cisco gear to get that all to work.""Of course, that wasn’t cheap. ""They spent $100 million on Cisco gear to get that all to work.""  That was version one. Google subsequently chucked the Cisco gear and built its own custom box that integrated with Hangouts, which it now sells as a Chromebox packed with some off-the-shelf parts. Highfive is a bit cheaper, integrates all the pieces into a single unit, and doesn’t require a separate remote control or a Google+ account. ""You have all this activity going on to make homes smart. Nest building a new thermostat, Dropcam giving you easy access to monitor your house,"" says Sinha. At work, however, there has been little of the same revolution, technology that modernizes the stodgy equipment we all interact with on a daily basis. ""That’s the product we created.""",0.5743257755524067,0.4256742244475933,0.639392858687585,1317,4.7365223993925589,669,5.9805680119581464,1,0,"Business, Tech, Report",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

But players may need to make a change to that routine, at the behest of the NFL and its new sponsor, Bose. According to Recode, the NFL has banned players and coaches from wearing any brand of headphones — other than Bose — during televised interviews and other on-camera appearances. The restrictions are in place during all games, as well as pre-season training camps and practice sessions, and it extends from the pre-game through to post-game interviews in the locker room up to 90 minutes after the whistle is blown. In an emailed statement, the NFL sought to distance Bose from the league's policy. ""The NFL has longstanding policies that prohibit branded exposure on-field or during interviews unless authorized by the league. These policies date back to the early 1990s and continue today."" The statement continues, ""They are the NFL’s policies — not one of the league’s sponsors, Bose in this case.  Bose is not involved in the enforcement of our policies."" A spokesperson noted that players could cover up logos on unauthorized gear. The news comes after a new sponsorship deal signed with Bose over the offseason that saw it replace Motorola as the provider of sideline headsets. Bloomberg reported at the time that Motorola had paid roughly $40 million a season for the privilege during its 13-year run with the NFL. The terms of Bose's deal with the NFL have not been disclosed. Considering Bose has paid up to join the NFL, it would make sense to cut off free advertising that its rivals receive when players wear their competing headphones — often emblazoned with a massive red Beats logo — before the game and during interviews.

On the surface this sounds like good news, with some eye-popping dollar figures. But the truth is that the details of Square's round seem to confirm ongoing reports that the company's growth is slowing, profits are lacking, and investors are increasingly reluctant to bet on its future. Square settled on an investor with little tech experience The lead investor in Square's latest round is the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation (GIC), a massive fund that puts the nation's surplus cash to work. It's not uncommon for US tech startups to get later-stage funding from Asian strategics — Pinterest, for example, was backed by Japan's Rakuten and Snapchat recently took a major investment from China's Tencent — but those are both examples of Asian internet companies backing a smaller company in a market where they have experience. The GIC has made only two internet investments and neither are similar to Square. All this suggests Square was struggling to find a new lead investor who would put up such a big sum without lowering the company's valuation, settling on a backer without a reputation in tech or any strategic alignment with its service. Speaking of which, the $6 billion figure sounds impressive, but actually continues a slowdown in the company's growth. Remember, at one point Square was being touted as the next big IPO prospect, a company that would rival CEO Jack Dorsey's success with his previous startup, Twitter. But as TechCrunch pointed out after Square's last round in January of this year, the value of the company compared to its revenue has been steadily declining. That's likely because it has become clear that Square's current business model can't generate a profit, no matter how large it scales. Its not all bad news. While GCI may not be a well known name, it's worth noting several of Square's earlier investors, including Goldman Sachs, participated in this latest round as well. The company's valuation has declined as a percentage of total revenue, but it did nearly double from 2012 and has increased 20 percent since the beginning of 2014. In April of this year it was reported that Square was running out of cash and looking to sell itself to a larger tech company. The company denied this report, but the fact that it's raised capital again without a significant change in its valuation implies that the company was indeed short on funds, or it would have held out for a better deal. Square has to worry about Apple Pay and an independent PayPal Where does Square go from here? In May it killed off its Wallet app, the company's big bet to make the transition from the low margin business of serving merchants to the more profitable consumer market. It replaced it with a different take on the same idea, this time called Square Order. That app debuted at No. 19 on the ""Food and Drink"" charts and has been declining ever since, hovering in the top 200 today according to App Annie. Its Square Cash app, which lets users easily exchange funds, has fared better, sticking in the top 20 on iOS and between 50 and 20 on Android. But that service generates little to no revenue for Square. There is still evidence of solid growth at Square. the company recently published a blog post noting that the merchants on its platform generate an annual revenue equal to the 13th largest retailer in the US. That's a big ballpark, but means Square is processing somewhere in the $30-40 billion range, of which it gets to keep roughly $300-400 million. It has also launched two new programs for small business lending and scheduling that it hopes will round out its revenue streams. But when it comes to its core business, Square faces an increasingly competitive landscape, with Apple Pay and an independent PayPal both about to enter the crowded marketplace for digital wallets. This new cash infusion will help Square to compete in the short-term, but it won't be enough to match the resources those tech titans can afford to spend over the next few years to win over both merchants and customers.",0.3336186901475446,0.6663813098524554,0.8632597138823268,727,4.8899587345254467,404,5.9529702970297027,0,0,"Business, Tech",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

Today, Samsung issued guidance for its forthcoming Q3 2014 earnings, telling investors that it expected operating profits of 4.1 trillion won ($3.8 billion) for the quarter, down a hefty 60 percent from the $10.6 trillion won operating profit that the company booked in Q3 2013. Consolidated revenues of approximately 47 trillion won also represented a 20 percent decline over the previous year's third quarter total of 59.1 trillion. Analysts had been predicting a big blow to Samsung's bottom line due to continued pressure on the high end from Apple as well as major market share challenges from Chinese manufacturers. Bloomberg predicted Samsung was poised for an ""'Ugly' quarter as iPhones get bigger"" in its pre-guidance analysis yesterday, and other experts echoed the sentiment. ""We can’t really expect good news from Samsung’s mobile business this year,"" Seoul-based analyst  Song Myung Sup told the financial news service. ""The most important thing for Samsung now is to protect its fast-falling market share, especially in China,"" declared Claire Kim of Daishin Securities. Sales have declined 20 percent over the previous year Samsung reported slower profit growth last quarter and in June warned investors that it didn't see a turnaround happening any time soon, although it remained cautiously optimistic about the impact of sales from its forthcoming Galaxy Note 4 — next quarter's earnings will give us a better idea as to how Samsung's latest Note stands up to Apple's first larger-screened iPhones, particular the iPhone 6 Plus. Of course slightly slower profit growth is far from the worst problem a company can have. To a degree, the blaring Bloomberg headline is a narrative for professional investors, not a warning to consumers. Apple has been dinged in the past for the same issues — when you're booking record profits, dips like this are entirely possible.

The AP said today that it's filing a lawsuit against the State Department, requesting access to emails that could shed light on her tenure as Secretary of State. Among other things, it's looking specifically for Clinton's full schedule and calendar, conversations with advisers who will be instrumental in her presidential campaign, and any messages regarding NSA surveillance and the raid that killed Osama bin Laden in 2011. ""At no time ... has the State Department ever indicated that it did not have possession or control over the records."" The AP says it's resorted to a lawsuit after the State Department failed to respond to five Freedom of Information Act requests over five years, and only partially fulfilled a sixth. ""At no time over the past five years has the State Department ever indicated that it did not have possession or control over the records,"" the complaint says.

It's not the only group to sue the State Department; conservative political action committee Citizens United filed suit to obtain Clinton's emails late last year, and conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch sued shortly after Clinton's private account was revealed. In a press conference yesterday, Clinton said that she used her private mail server for both government and personal correspondence as ""a matter of convenience,"" and that this was allowed by the State Department at the time. Government communications are supposed to be stored and available for public examination, something that a private account wouldn't allow, but she said that by sending messages to colleagues' government accounts, she made sure that recipients archived them instead. Nonetheless, she handed over 55,000 pages of work-related emails two months ago, roughly half the 60,000 total messages — the rest, Clinton has said, are personal messages. After the private account was discovered, Clinton said that she had requested the State Department look over and release as many of her work-related emails as possible, and the department has agreed to do so.

The complaint also says that DirecTV failed to mention that offers of free premium channels, like HBO, would result in charges if those channels were not cancelled before the free period was up.  ""DirecTV sought to lock customers into longer and more expensive contracts."" ""DirecTV misled consumers about the cost of its satellite television services and cancellation fees,"" FTC chairwoman Edith Ramirez says in a statement. ""DirecTV sought to lock customers into longer and more expensive contracts and premium packages that were not adequately disclosed. It’s a bedrock principle that the key terms of an offer to a consumer must be clear and conspicuous, not hidden in fine print."" The commission has filed suit in a federal court, seeking to prohibit DirecTV from continuing these practices. It's also looking for a monetary judgement that will allow it to refund affected consumers. The FTC alleges that DirecTV violates the FTC Act by making deceptive claims and the Restore Online Shoppers’ Confidence Act by not clearly disclosing that premium channels would eventually result in charges. DirecTV strongly disagrees with the the FTC's complaint. ""The FTC’s decision is flat-out wrong and we will vigorously defend ourselves, for as long as it takes,"" a DirecTV spokesperson says in a statement provided to The Verge. ""We go above and beyond to ensure that every new customer receives all the information they need, multiple times, to make informed and intelligent decisions. For us to do anything less just doesn’t make sense."" The FTC says that it's seen many instances of this behavior since 2007. It says that DirecTV advertises programming packages as being ""for 12 months"" without clearly disclosing that a two-year contract is required. The complaint also says that DirecTV's pricing on these packages would jump from $25 to $45 during the second year of the contract and that it would charge up to $480 for early cancellation. While you'll find similar deal structures from other TV providers, you'll usually also find — placed in one corner or another of their website or literature — disclosures about rising prices and contracts. Apparently, the FTC believes that DirecTV's disclosures were too discreet, writing in its filing with the court that ""to the extent"" those disclosures were even present, they were too ""inadequate"" to properly inform consumers.",0.5953862795961622,0.4046137204038378,0.5696301567145549,455,5.3340659340659338,263,6.2623574144486689,0,0,"Policy & Law, US & World",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

The nonprofit will be joined in its efforts by eight other organizations and is being represented by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). ""Our aim in filing this suit is to end this mass surveillance program in order to protect the rights of our users around the world,"" said the foundation in a blog post. the lawsuit will focus on upstream surveillance The full complaint has been published by the ACLU, with Wikimedia explaining it will focus on ""upstream"" surveillance — the direct interception of vast amounts of data by tapping internet infrastructure such as undersea cables. This method of surveillance has been authorized in the US under the 2008 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act Amendments Act (FAA) to monitor ""non-US persons"" only. However, as Wikimedia notes, this approach casts a wide net, capturing the data of many US citizens as well as innocent internet users overseas. Although this is not the first attempt to sue the NSA, other lawsuits have been concerned with phone-tapping rather than upstream surveillance. ""By tapping the backbone of the internet, the NSA is straining the backbone of democracy,"" wrote Lila Tretikov, executive director of the Wikimedia Foundation, in a blog post. ""Wikipedia is founded on the freedoms of expression, inquiry, and information. By violating our users’ privacy, the NSA is threatening the intellectual freedom that is central to people’s ability to create and understand knowledge."" Wikimedia says the NSA has violated the us constitution Wikimedia says it believes that the NSA's surveillance practices violate the US Constitution's First and Fourth Amendments — those protecting free speech and unreasonable search and seizure. It says the spy agency's practices, first revealed in documents leaked by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, also violate Article III of the Constitution, which establishes the authority of US courts. In an op-ed in The New York Times, Tretikov and Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales argue that NSA surveillance not only harms US citizens, but also those working in oppressive regimes overseas. They give the example of the 2011 Arab uprisings, during which Egyptian spies boasted they were in ""constant contact"" with the CIA even as Wikipedia users in their country updated articles with information about the then-illegal protests. ""a loss for everyone who uses wikipedia and the internet."" ""If that user knows the NSA is routinely combing through her contributions to Wikipedia, and possibly sharing information with her government, she will surely be less likely to add her knowledge or have that conversation, for fear of reprisal,"" write Wales and Tretikov. ""Imagine this decision playing out in the minds of thousands of would-be contributors in other countries. That represents a loss for everyone who uses Wikipedia and the internet."" Unfortunately, it's difficult to unambiguously prove that this data is being collected — and this means that Wikimedia will have a hard time winning its case. In order for the case to be considered, the plaintiffs will have to prove that they were affected by the NSA's actions. The NSA, however, can argue that plaintiffs can't know if their communications were intercepted in the first place — a stance that has been effective in the past, simply because secret surveillance programs are, by nature, secretive. For Wales and Tretikov, however, there can be no other option: ""Privacy is an essential right. It makes freedom of expression possible, and sustains freedom of inquiry and association. It empowers us to read, write, and communicate in confidence, without fear of persecution. Knowledge flourishes where privacy is protected.""",0.7072105118293568,0.2927894881706432,0.8403588067743458,612,5.416666666666667,341,6.7184750733137832,0,0,"Policy & Law, Tech, US & World",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

But the same goes for the stars — and particularly for Jennifer Lawrence, who has become a beloved household name largely on the strength of the series. The Comic-Con panel was the beginning of the end of the tour for Lawrence and the cast, but it was also a chance for the Hunger Games crew to put up their feet and look back at their journey. Naturally, things got a little weird.  Josh Hutcherson tries out his cricket and squirrel sound effects at #SDCC A video posted by Josh Lincoln Dickey (@jldlite) on Jul 9, 2015 at 1:33pm PDT Conan O'Brien moderated the panel, which included Lawrence, Josh Hutcherson, Liam Hemsworth, and Willow Shields, as well as director Francis Lawrence and producer Nina Jacobson. The mood was a little tired, a little delirious, and definitely ready to cut loose, and the whole panel felt like a visit with an awkwardly close family. The Jennifer Lawrence Charming Awkwardness Machine was easily the highlight — unlike most actresses who easily spout platitudes about how great a journey their film was, Lawrence simply could not seem to get the words out. She tried, but she fumbled. Otherwise she seemed distracted by literally anything. Jennifer Lawrence's nose itches.  But when she was on, she was on. ""Nothing about me and Katniss is similar, because she's brave and I'm ... an actress,"" she said at one point, easily the best line of the panel. Josh Hutcherson and Liam Hemsworth played off her battiness with aplomb. Hemsworth got plenty of screams from adoring fans, leaning right into his role as the sexy, spurned love interest. But it was Hutcherson and Lawrence who had the most bizarre, endearing onstage repartee. At one point Lawrence touched his face when he seemed a little overcome by the fans. So Jennifer Lawrence's fingers smell weird?  It remains to be seen what kind of note Mockingjay — Part 2 ends the series on.

Comic-Con International finally kicked off on Thursday, packing the halls of the San Diego Convention Center until the festival overflowed onto the streets of the Gaslamp Quarter. Outside, attendees wandered through parkour courses and selfie stations and ""escape rooms"" as brand-wrapped buses and streetcars rumbled by. Inside, thousands of people lined up for the day's biggest attraction, a Hunger Games panel in the cavernous-but-never-big-enough Hall H — many of them giving up a night's sleep so they could be there when Jennifer Lawrence touched Josh Hutcherson's face. But not everyone was lucky enough see that moment in person, friends, because Comic-Con is a callous game from which emerge both winners and losers. For every Cumberbitch who makes it into Hall H to hear his favorite actor deliver a prerecorded video message promoting the upcoming Sherlock Christmas special, there's an anguished Whovian collapsing in despair as the trailer for series 9 makes its world premiere while she's still half a mile back in line. Anguished Whovians collapsing in despair And that's nothing compared to the pressure faced by brands, who pay hundreds of thousands of dollars on their Comic-Con stunts and spend four days flogging them relentlessly to their fans. If you're attending Comic-Con, the thinking goes, you're the kind of person who is seeing their movies on opening weekend, buying Blu-Rays of their television shows, and preordering downloads of their video games. They're going to try to milk you for billions, if only they can whet your appetite for the content to come. Comic-Con is an effort to trigger a stampede of influencers. It's the running of the bulls, but for marketing. By now you've seen Thursday's trailers and memorized the release dates, but still a question gnaws at you: who is winning Comic-Con, and who is losing? We spent all night crunching the numbers, and are happy now to share the results.  WIN: Thursday opened strong with Lionsgate's panel for The Hunger Games: Mockingjay — Part 2, the final dystopian gasp of the franchise. A new trailer was shown featuring **explosions** and a sense that the series was returning to action after the grim, plodding Mockingjay — Part 1. It hasn't hit the internet yet, but Verge reporter Kwame Opam certified it as dope from his seat in Hall H. The trailer was followed by a genuinely strange Q&A with the cast, which Conan O'Brien moderated as Josh Hutcherson made squirrel noises. Team Coco's involvement makes it likely that highlights of the panel will be broadcast on one of Conan's daily broadcasts from the convention, the sort of buzz-building content synergy that's gonna move some Fandango tickets come November. LOSS: Next up, Hall H delivered a taste of the upcoming season of Doctor Who, the long-running BBC show watched by all the least sociable kids in your dorm. Doctor Who is the kind of show that never seems to create new fans, but rather exists to inflame debate among seasoned experts as to who the best ""doctor"" and ""companion"" were. The teaser trailer showed off fractional glimpses of episodes from the coming season, all of which indicate the series' lo-fi camp value has continued into this, its 52nd year. ""I'm the doctor, and I save people!"" bellows our current Time Lord Peter Capaldi in the trailer, which makes one long for the relative catchphrase sophistication of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles' ""Cowabunga!""  LOSS: Across the way in a lesser hall, Street Fighter fans were getting a first look at some new characters. The venerable 2D fighting game went hilariously out of its way to ""confirm"" that Ken will be in the forthcoming Street Fighter V, which is a little like ""confirming"" you've included Bart Simpson in your new Simpsons video game. But in my favorite moment of the day, a Capcom executive announced an upcoming crossover comic book in which Street Fighter supervillain M. Bison will team up with G.I. Joe's hated Cobra Commander to seize control of the world, an announcement which was lustily booed by an audience that appeared to be on the brink of throwing things. It was an important and necessary reminder on the first day of Comic-Con that brand synergies are fragile, dangerous compounds that can explode on you at any time. Do I have to remind you what happened when Scooby Doo met the Harlem Globetrotters?   WIN: Happily, Call of Duty, the world's most profitable cross-platform murder simulation, appeared on stage next for the kind of killer crossover that Comic-Conners can rally behind: brain-eating zombies. Shadows of Evil is a zombie-themed adventure from the upcoming Call of Duty: Black Ops III, and as the lights dimmed for Activision's world premiere of the trailer, the disaffected teen next to me illicitly Snapchatted the screen and told his friend nearby that he found the presentation ""sick"" — a huge brand win in the game's core demographic. And that's to say nothing of the game's Juggernog Collector's Edition, which comes with a functional mini-fridge that holds 12 cans of beer. A video game that comes with a goddam refrigerator: that's some next-level, brandfluential content leadership, and it cemented Call of Duty into a bona fide Comic-Con winner.

(Full disclosure: Comcast just announced a $200 million investment in Vox Media, The Verge's parent company.) Business Insider says this in-the-works service is currently called Watchable, though the final brand may change. (""Watchable"" makes the content sound a bit underwhelming, no?) The Information first reported on Comcast's plans to create a wide-reaching video service in April. Like Stream, it sounds like Watchable will start out as an exclusive to Xfinity customers with a curated selection of video from Comcast's partners. But Business Insider suggests that eventually it'll be made widely available on Android and iOS. Content makers won't have to exclusively keep their videos on Watchable — they'll be free to publish on Facebook and YouTube at the same time. There are positives for Comcast as well; the company won't be paying out licensing fees for anything that appears on Watchable, but will split advertising revenue with its partners. That's much different from the TV world, where Comcast must negotiate complex licensing terms with popular channels.

While touring a medical facility in the UK, a reporter asked him whether Americans should vaccinate their children. After saying that he vaccinated his own, the likely Republican presidential candidate said that ""parents need to have some measure of choice in things as well, so that’s the balance that the government has to decide."" Criticism was swift, and Christie’s office soon sent out another statement: ""The Governor believes vaccines are an important public health protection and with a disease like measles there is no question kids should be vaccinated."" Christie’s comments came a day after President Obama appeared on NBC and called for parents to vaccinate their kids, and given that context, they have the appearance of the politicization of vaccination along partisan lines. That would be very bad. Hi, @washingtonpost, I think you meant ""science"" or ""doctors"" or ""reality."" pic.twitter.com/tQmtib1lbW  The anti-vaccination movement has proven frustratingly difficult to stop, even when it deals exclusively in conspiracy and long-debunked studies. The source text for the movement is a retracted study by a disgraced British doctor purporting to show health risks associated with the measles vaccine, yet no number of studies debunking its claims have been able to change the minds of anti-vaxxers.  The last thing the movement needs is the legitimacy of political debate and a call to hear both sides. Though it might seem like an odd fit for a conservative politician — the current outbreak is traced to a trend among parents in wealthy, well-educated, and generally liberal areas of California — anti-vaxxers also frequently base their stance on religious ground or freedom from government meddling. One study shows that willingness to get vaccinated correlates with trust in government. Christie himself has a history of courting anti-vaxxers. In a letter from Christie’s 2009 campaign for governor found by Olivia Nuzzi, Christie seems to acknowledge the retracted and debunked link between vaccines and autism. The last thing the movement needs is the legitimacy of political debate and a call to hear both sides As the early stages of the 2016 presidential race get underway, Christie has been trying to contrast himself with Obama on everything from ISIS to trade agreements. Notably, he imposed strict quarantines for doctors returning from Ebola-stricken countries, attacking the Obama administration’s response. When the quarantines were criticized for being overly strict and unnecessary, Christie defended them, citing public health. ""My first and foremost obligation is to protect the public health and safety of the people of New Jersey,"" Christie said. ""And so I’m sorry if in anyway she was inconvenienced, but the inconvenience that could occur from having folks who are symptomatic and ill out and amongst the public is a much, much greater concern of mine."" Right now, the easiest way to protect the public health and safety of the people of New Jersey is to make sure they get their shots. Among the unvaccinated, measles will infect 90 percent of people who are exposed — it’s a very contagious illness, far more so than Ebola. But it’s an avoidable one. It’s preventable with a simple vaccine — that’s how the United States eliminated the disease in 2000 and why scientists, health workers, and public officials have been unanimously pleading for parents to vaccinate their children. Vaccination doesn't work unless almost everyone is vaccinated The bright side is that publicly coming out against vaccinations is political and career suicide. Michele Bachmann was roundly attacked in 2011 for saying that HPV vaccines were dangerous. Even Jenny McCarthy, the closest thing anti-vaccination has to a public figure, has been desperately trying distance herself from the movement ever since her career began to spiral downward. That said, there’s a lot of space for ambiguity and doublespeak between open support of anti-vaxxer claims and full-throated rejection. Calls for ""balance"" and to hear both sides obscure the fact that the science is settled: the vaccine is safe and effective. Worse, they give the impression that this is a debate about personal choice and government power, a framing that has the potential to trigger partisan commitments. There are areas where those debates make sense, where the data isn’t as clean-cut. Vaccination isn’t one of them. They don’t work unless almost everyone is vaccinated. It’s not just about making a choice for your kid, as fraught as that decision already is; it’s about making a choice for everyone else’s kid who’s too young or ill to get the vaccine. UPDATE: Another potential Republican presidential candidate, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), says that most vaccines should be ""voluntary."" Speaking on the Laura Ingraham show today, Paul said, “I’m not anti-vaccine at all,” but “I think that’s a personal decision.”",0.2836888823521414,0.7163111176478586,0.8339759279094588,812,5.3953201970443354,448,6.4553571428571432,0,0,"Policy & Law, Science, US & World",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

In 1999, a woodcutter named James B. Grinder confessed to a 15-year-old murder, the death of a 25-year-old woman named Julie Helton. A short time later, he recanted, contradicting himself over and over. His blood had been taken and compared against the crime scene samples — but with such an old crime, local police were worried the case might fall apart, so the sheriff called in a doctor he had seen on the news. The doctor's name was Lawrence Farwell, and he was promoting a next-generation tool called brain fingerprinting. It was an advanced lie detector that claimed to look into a suspect's brain to see if they were familiar with the details of the crime. This was the first time the technique had been used in an active criminal case, although Farwell had tested the technique with scientists at the FBI. So far, he said, the accuracy rate was 100 percent.  The local police were thrilled to try it out, so Farwell set up his computer at the prison where Grinder was being held, along with the bundle of wires and electrodes used to take EEG readings of brain activity. Grinder sat in front of a screen in his orange jumpsuit, with a blue strap over his forehead to secure the device. Behind him, Farwell asked questions and monitored the results on a screen, grilling the convict about specific details of his crime. By the time the test was over, Farwell was convinced. Faced with overwhelming evidence, Grinder pled guilty and was sentenced to life without parole. ""There is no question that J. B. Grinder raped and murdered Julie Helton,"" Farwell told a local paper after the plea. ""The significant details of the crime are stored in his brain."" Grinder's case was the first time Farwell's technique was used in an investigation, but it wasn't the last. Farwell tested the device on two other convicted murderers in the following years, Terry Harrington in Iowa and Jimmy Ray Slaughter in Oklahoma, before moving the technique to a bigger stage. Farwell founded a company, Brainwave Sciences, to build ready-made brain-reading rigs that could be deployed on a mass scale. Naturally charismatic, Farwell was a hit with the media, feted by major outlets from 60 Minutes to Time. In 2013, Brainwave Sciences made its first sale to Singapore's police force. Since then, the technique has also popped up in Indian courts, used with Farwell's blessing. In August, the Florida State Police bought another batch of the devices for everyday use. Krishna Ika, Brainwave's CEO, describes the product as ""a revolutionary scientific technology to detect whether specific information is in a person's brain or not."" Based on the company's testing, Ika says he's seen an accuracy rate of ""close to 100 percent."" But as the technique has spread, it's also struggled to shake accusations of shoddy testing, inflated claims, or even outright pseudoscience. Farwell has conducted extensive testing, but it's all been behind closed doors, whether it's with government agencies or prospective clients. He maintains that his test is based on solid neuroscience and that it's never produced a false result, but academic neuroscientists complain that his methods are effectively secret and have never been subject to public review. As Farwell's technique arrives in police stations and courtrooms, it raises a serious question: when Farwell looked into J. B. Grinder's mind, how much could he really see? Attach two pieces of conductive material to a person's scalp, forming a circuit, and you can begin to pick up on what's happening inside. Monitor the circuit, and you'll get a wave-like reading, a constant ebb and flow of electrical activity. Once you're accustomed to the rhythms, you can pick out disturbances, which often lead back to specific events in the brain. The test is called an electroencephalogram or EEG, and it's one of the most common ways to check patients for seizures or abnormal brain activity. In 1965, a group of scientists discovered a distinctive surge of electrical activity in the EEG wave when a person saw something familiar, usually arriving 300 milliseconds after the object was revealed. They called it the P300 response, and while the neurological origins of the surge are still unclear, the behavior has been replicated over and over in the decades since. A scientist might trigger it with an unexpected low note after a series of high notes, or showing a subject his best friend's face mixed in with pictures of strangers. When the P300 is used in interrogations, the questions are more pointed. Was the victim killed with a knife? Was the victim shot? Was the victim strangled? It's called the Concealed Information Test, or CIT. There might be a dozen such questions, all covering a single concrete aspect of the crime, but only one of them describes what really happened. If the suspect knows the victim was shot, he'll show a P300 response when that specific question is asked. A conventional polygraph relies on flashes of sweat from the autonomous nervous response, a physiological panic brought on by lying, but the P300 is entirely confined to the brain, making it significantly harder to beat. Suspects can still ignore the questions entirely or try to trigger recognition through other means, but questioning protocols can be arranged to catch them in the act. The usual polygraph tricks won't work, and the system is much more resistant to adversaries. But while Farwell has often used the science behind the P300 to justify his techniques, many scientists aren't happy about it. In 2012, a group of researchers struck back against Farwell's work, writing in Cognitive Neurodynamics that his research ""is misleading and misrepresents the scientific status of brain fingerprinting technology."" While the P300 can be triggered by any event that violates a subject's expectations, Farwell usually describes it as a direct view onto a suspect's memory. Farwell had boasted about 10 different field studies, but only two of the studies were peer-reviewed, totaling 30 participants in sum. The process still maintains a nominal 100 percent success rate, but it ends up duplicating some participants and excluding others to get there. ""The review violates some of the cherished canons of science,"" the piece concludes, ""and if Dr. Farwell is, as he claims to be, a ‘‘brain fingerprinting scientist’’ he should feel obligated to retract the article."" Even for those who believe in the science behind the P300, there are real questions about how it will stand up in an actual investigation. A recent study compared P300 with the skin conductance response, used in the common polygraph lie detector, and came away with mixed results. When innocent participants were included, the P300 far outpaced the traditional polygraph, resulting in far fewer false-positives. But when the participants had to work through an actual crime scenario, stealing a purse and then being confronted with details, the P300 was often less reliable than the polygraph. The questioners were forced to guess at what actually happened, introducing new uncertainty and driving up error rates. Many guilty suspects ended up passing the test simply because they hadn't paid attention to the objects in the test. Another concern is that the real benefits are coming from the method of questioning rather than the brain measurements themselves. Traditional lie-detection protocols look for deception; if you say you didn't kill your wife and the machine spikes, that counts as evidence that you did. But the Concealed Information Test takes a different approach, looking to prove that a suspect knows things that only a guilty person would know. That means collecting specific information and keeping it out of the public eye until the information can be used in a test. It's a lot more work than the average polygraph, but in exchange, cops get a less error-prone test, and one that's particularly resistant to false positives that might put an innocent person in jail. The only real change here is the interrogation strategy. CIT appears to be more reliable, even used with traditional polygraph equipment, and it's already popular with Japanese law enforcement and the FBI. But if the benefit of the test comes from asking different questions, why bother with brain measurements at all? What's left is a mix of proven techniques and dangerously exaggerated benefits, which has many observers worried about the effect it could have on the legal system. ""It's not ready for the courtroom yet,"" says Jane Moriarty, a chaired professor at Duquesne's School of Law. ""There's not enough testing behind it to say, yes, we should use this as evidence to convict people."" In particular, Moriarty is concerned that laboratory testing can't reliably replicate the brain activity of a suspect being interrogated for an actual crime. It's easy for Rosenfeld, Farwell, and others to interrogate student volunteers, but when it's an actual suspect being questioned about an actual murder, the neurological reactions may be significantly different. How does the test hold up on neurologically atypical suspects, like psychopaths or the mentally ill? It's not clear how scientists can control for those factors, and they could leave a dangerous loophole if the method is more widely adopted. So far, brain fingerprinting has only been admitted into court evidence once: in Harrington v. State (2003), in which the court mentioned the finding but did not rely on it. But in the years since, courts have ruled against admitting fMRI lie detection evidence for the same concerns voiced by Moriarty, suggesting lab testing wasn't yet applicable to a real-life case. There's been no ruling on Farwell's method specifically, leaving it in a kind of legal limbo within the US. At the same time, the technique is already gaining adherents in Australia and India, playing off its early successes in American courts. Still, the more judges let brain fingerprinting into court across the world, the more precedent it will have as evidence, and the harder it will be to dismiss. That vicious cycle has kept bad science in courtrooms before, whether it's bite-mark tests or handwriting analysis. In the Cameron Todd Willingham case, overly confident arson investigators turned an accidental fire into a triple murder, sending an innocent man to his death. Once a local analyst is seen as an expert in a given technique, it's often very hard to wean judges off the technique, even when the science has been largely discredited. ""A lot of these kinds of forensic science — bite marks, arson experts, handwriting analysis — they testify as experts and they have for decades,"" Moriarty says. ""One of my concerns is, if we let it in, will we ever be able to get it out again?"" But while researchers worry, Brainwave Sciences is busy spreading its wares. Ika says the company is in negotiations with six other countries, who are intrigued by the device's possible applications in counter-terrorism screening. ""It's still close to 100 percent reliable, with no false positives or false negatives,"" he says. ""We're very eager to see if someone can prove that wrong.""",0.5041543601643355,0.49584563983566454,0.8447908063367545,1854,5.0787486515641858,883,6.5050962627406568,0,3,"Policy & Law, Science, Report",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Those who used gadgets including MP3 players, video game consoles, tablets, smartphones, and computers for more than five hours a day were three and a half times more likely to sleep for fewer than five hours at night and 49 percent likelier to need more than an hour to get to sleep. ""There was a gradual increase up to this point,"" lead author Dr. Mari Hysing told The Verge. ""The more you spent on devices during the daytime, the less you slept, and the longer it took to fall asleep."" The research confirms long-standing assumptions about the effects of electronic devices on sleep, but scientists say the exact mechanisms at work still aren’t clear. Light from electronic devices could be affecting teenagers’ body clocks, for example, or there could be less obvious effects, such as the emotional stimulation from chatting with friends.  (BMJ Open) The study questioned teenagers on their screen time both throughout the day and during the hour prior to sleep. Respondents who used computers or smartphones during this last 60 minutes before bed were 53 percent and 35 percent more likely, respectively, to miss out on two or more hours of sleep, with smaller risks reported for those using tablets, TVs, video game consoles, and MP3 players. People have different needs for sleep, but in general teenagers need eight to nine hours. Lack of sleep is linked to everything from obesity to bad grades And getting the right amount of sleep isn’t just important for avoiding bad moods the next day. Scientists have found links between a lack of sleep and all sorts of harmful outcomes, from obesity to lower grades in school. Overtiredness in children has even been found to predict problems with alcohol and drugs. Although the study establishes a clear link between increased screen time and bad sleeping habits, scientists say the exact cause of disruption still isn’t clear. Previous studies have found a link between the exposure to artificial light and decreases in melatonin, the hormone that controls our body clock, but more oblique mechanisms may also be at work. For example the emotional stimulation provided by talking to friends. ""As a clinician,"" says Dr. Hysing, ""I’ve seen teenagers get worried just by mentioning a test a day after or an exam, and these worries might be triggered by social media. You might also lose the sense of control in your environment because anyone can contact you at night."" Dr. Hysing also mentions the possibility that some of the study’s observations were caused by adolescents using electronic devices as a sleeping aid when they felt too awake, or to counteract boredom at night. But they may be reaching for the wrong sleep aids, since ""the relationship between poor sleep and electronic media use reflects a self-perpetuating cycle,"" the research says. We sleep less because we use our gadgets too much and then we use our gadgets too much because we sleep less. there's a link between screen time and sleep, but we need lab studies to pin it down Scientists will have to wait for controlled lab studies to find out more, says Dr. Akhilesh Reddy, a specialist in circadian rhythms at the University of Cambridge. ""People have made peripheral links with things like melatonin for a marker of how light might affect sleep,"" he says, ""But you could affect melatonin without affecting sleep."" Dr. Reddy also points out that it’s very difficult to control all the parameters in studies like this, with seemingly insignificant variables like a subject’s height playing a part. ""This would mean longer arms and therefore you might get less exposure to a screen’s light,"" he says, adding that whatever field studies researchers conduct, ""teenagers are going to be doing all sorts of things you can’t control for."" Parents that are trying to make sure their children get a good night’s sleep will no doubt feel the same way.",0.3224783923915404,0.6775216076084596,0.23059616174557307,762,4.9750656167979006,393,5.9694656488549622,0,2,Science,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The findings, based on reported suicides over a 30-year period, add to growing concerns about the immediate health impacts of major public spending cuts passed across Europe following the global financial crisis. The study, published in the BMJ Open, examines trends in monthly suicides in Greece from 1983 to 2012. Its authors monitored monthly suicide totals changed following 12 pre-selected economic events: eight austerity-related and four prosperity-related. In October 2008, as Greece entered a recession, suicides among men spiked by 13 percent and maintained a higher average in the months that followed, the study reports. In June 2011, when a new round of austerity measures was met with protests and strikes, suicides among both men and women increased by 36 percent, and they remained high. ""It might be the economic policies themselves that are driving it, but also the public messaging."" Suicide rates in Greece and much of southern Europe have historically been low compared to other developed countries. But a 2011 study found that rates have increased across Europe following the financial crisis, especially in debt-saddled Greece. In 2010, the Greek government began rolling out a series of controversial measures that would raise taxes and cut billions in public spending, sparking widespread protests and general strikes. The cost-cutting also left its public healthcare system under considerable strain, prompting closer studies of its health-related impacts. A 2014 study found a direct link between spending cuts and increased suicide rates among Greek men, while a 2013 paper found a similar connection in Spain following the financial crisis. Others have expressed more skepticism about the relationship between Greece’s economic crisis and elevated suicides. The study released today is the first to link monthly suicide data over multiple decades to specific austerity-related events, though its authors are quick to note that their findings shouldn’t be interpreted as a policy critique. ""We are not economists or finance ministers or bankers, so we don’t have any comment about the actual austerity measures and what’s in them and how they’re constructed,"" says Charles Branas, an epidemiologist at the University of Pennsylvania and lead author of the study. ""However… I think perhaps policy makers can understand there are potentially negative public health impacts that follow austerity measures like this — perhaps very soon after austerity measures. It might be the economic policies themselves that are driving it, but also the public messaging of the policies."" Education and prevention are critical, though the media may have a role to play as well, Branas says. According to his analysis, male suicides briefly jumped by 30 percent after a Greek pensioner publicly committed suicide in April 2012. The event received widespread coverage and, as the study notes, was reported in ways that could promote copycats: details of the man’s life, his method of suicide, and quotes from a note he left behind. Interestingly, one prosperity-related event — the adoption of the euro currency in January 2002 — preceded a sharp but temporary 27 percent decrease in male suicides. ""we cannot close our eyes to what is obvious."" Branas stresses that his study examines only the short-term impact of austerity-related events on suicides and that it excludes data on attempted suicides. The authors controlled for changes in population, demographics, unemployment, and other variables, though they acknowledge that the difficulty in isolating the impact of a single event. The pensioner’s public suicide, for example, happened during the same month as the announcement of national elections, heightening political and economic tensions. Thomas Hyphantis, a psychiatry professor at Greece’s University of Ioannina, who was not involved in the study, says Branas’ work ""confirms without doubt"" that the Greek crisis has had a detrimental impact on suicides. ""It is true that not all suicides are due to the financial crisis and austerity measures, and this should be seriously taken into account, especially by the media when presenting individual suicides or suicide rates,"" Hyphantis said in an email. ""However, it is also true that not all suicides have their origins in the individual’s biological or psychological background, and the research at hand has established the link between suicide rates and austerity measures taken in Greece. We cannot therefore push this message ‘under the pillow’; we cannot close our eyes to what is obvious."" Others raise doubts that the announcement of austerity measures would have such an immediate impact on suicide rates. ""Of course, suicide is not an option that [somebody] takes in a couple of days or months,"" says Nikolaos Antonakakis, an economics professor at Vienna University for Economics and Business, who was not involved with the study. Antonakakis, who co-authored the 2014 study linking spending cuts to increased male suicides, adds that the model used in today’s study could be extended to examine longer periods before and after austerity measures are announced. This, he says, would give a better sense of the mechanisms through which the policies may lead to increased suicide rates. ""If they’re applied immediately, and lead to immediate pension cuts, then of course the effect on suicide will be more immediate,"" he says. ""But it also takes some time"" for their full economic effect to be felt. Experts agree that Greece’s suicide trends are worrisome, and its economic outlook remains grim. But its politics have suddenly changed. Last month, the left-wing Syriza party swept into power.

That means that just by setting up a habitat, Bigelow would be able to claim exclusive rights to that territory. Furthermore, any company staking a claim could tap ""related areas"" for mining, exploration, and other activities. Nothing is set in stone, however. George Nield, the FAA's associate administrator for the Office of Commercial Transportation, explains: Bigelow Aerospace plans to test one of its habitats on the International Space Station later this year, and has proposed free-flying versions that could be used by government agencies, research organizations, businesses, and tourists.

So far, only 40 percent of Ebola donation pledges have been paid out, and according to the author of the study, the delayed response from international health agencies might be to blame. ""The WHO and others didn’t ask for money soon enough,"" says Karen Grépin, a global health policy researcher at New York University and the author of the study. ""There’s no doubt in my mind that the delay between the time when the WHO learned about the outbreak and the time when the WHO and others called for donations was really too long."" The WHO failed to respond to The Verge's requests for comment. ""The WHO and others didn’t ask for money soon enough."" The current Ebola epidemic has infected over 22,000 people and has killed more than 8,500, according to the WHO’s latest report. Guinea’s Ministry of Health told the WHO about its Ebola outbreak in March 2013, but the WHO didn’t declare a state of emergency until August. As a result, most organizations waited to donate to the cause. And because there’s usually a long delay between the time when pledges are made to when they’re paid out, the money is still just trickling into affected countries. ""When you have exponential growth of cases, any delay can have life and death consequences for people,"" she says. ""For Ebola the consequences are pretty stark."" In the study, Grépin used data from the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs’ financial tracking system to figure out a timeline of Ebola donations. She found that only 40 percent of pledges — or about two-thirds of the amount requested by affected countries — had been received by their intended recipients by the end of 2014. This amounts to about $1.09 billion of $2.89 billion in pledges. $1.09 billion of the total $2.89 billion has been paid out This delay wasn’t uniform. The US has been the largest donor thus far, with a total of $900 million in pledges, and it has paid out about 95 percent of the money it promised. The UK and the World Bank are the second- and third-largest donors, with pledges amounting to $307 million and $230 million, respectively, according to the study. Yet the World Bank has only funded abut half of its total pledges, Grépin says. She thinks this might be because the World Bank's donations tend to be shunted into a more complex program, where they do things like extend loans or pay health care workers' salaries. The World Bank did not respond to our requests for comment prior to the publication of this article. A spokesperson from the World Bank got in touch with us after this story was published, however. According to the spokesperson, the World Bank has pledged $518 million to date, not $230 million — a number that the BMJ study says relates to pledges made prior to December 31st, 2014. Of that total, the World Bank says it has disbursed $283 million, or about 55 percent of what it has pledged. Moreover, total World Bank commitments to the Ebola response ""are about $1 billion,"" the spokesperson said, which also includes at least $450 million from the World Bank's International Finance Corporation, their private sector arm, but isn't included in the UN's financial tracking system. Grépin's analysis also revealed that Liberia received far more pledges than Sierra Leone, despite the fact that Sierra Leone has experienced double the amount of Ebola cases. This is largely due to political ties, Grépin explains. For historical reasons, ""Liberia is a large recipient from the US government, and the US government is far more generous,"" she says, whereas Guinea largely received aid from francophone countries, and the UK gave to Sierra Leone.  Liberia received more pledges than Sierra Leone even though Sierra Leone had double the amount of Ebola cases Overall, international organizations received more money than affected countries. This isn’t all that surprising, Grépin says; international organizations often have better results scaling up their efforts and recruiting foreign medical teams than a country whose health system is decimated. But it may have some long-term consequences. ""Stand-alone treatment centers were constructed, and in some cases they are being knocked down now,"" she says. Building nonpermanent structures and bringing in foreign doctors is ""probably the right call for expediency purposes,"" but these sorts of efforts don’t really help a country avoid public health crises in the future. Understanding exactly what went wrong within the WHO won’t be easy. But it might be possible to fix the problem before we have full knowledge of them. Grépin thinks that creating an independent body charged with assessing these situations as they arise instead of relying on a declaration from the WHO's director could speed up the process. Countries have 24 hours to report a public health threat, she says, so ""why isn’t there a comparable, automatic system at the international level?"" ""Why isn’t there a comparable, automatic system at the international level?"" Grépin’s analysis doesn’t perfectly capture Ebola-related aid efforts. The database she used is updated daily, but it relies mostly on self-reporting. This means that some large donors probably weren’t in the analysis, she says. Moreover, the UN’s financial tracking system was very good about updating pledge dates, but didn’t always have information about when the donations actually came through. Finally, the database doesn’t include typical World Bank interventions like extending a country’s line of credit. ""Tracking resources in times of crisis are challenging,"" Grepin says. And the Ebola epidemic carries a set of peculiarities that may have complicated the endeavor. ""Never before has a public health emergency also been considered a humanitarian crisis,"" she says. What’s perhaps most striking about the analysis is the fact that some donors started to give small sums before the WHO declared an emergency. ""It’s kind of puzzling because it  seems like this was more important to the donors than to the WHO,"" Grépin says. ""I think we're going to try to account for the [delay] for years to come."" Update February 4th, 9:00AM: This article has been updated with a response from the World Bank. Update February 4th, 2:07PM: The Verge asked Karen Grépin to comment on the World Bank's response to the BMJ study. This is what she told us: ""Much of the resources given by the World Bank are underestimated in the Financial Tracking System. Given that my main conclusion is that donors have been generous, I see this as a justifiable position. I decided to rely upon the FTS because it is the most standardized source of data.

The researchers call the approach ""assisted evolution."" In a sense, it’s the same thing we’ve been doing with domesticated plants and animals for thousands of years, cross-breeding organisms for desirable traits. But the idea of using these methods for the purposes of conservation is new. The traits that scientists are looking for aren’t things like faster growth or more edible meat, but the ability to survive in a changing environment. The researchers admit their approach is ""extremely novel"" and view the project as a proof of concept, according to the paper published in PNAS earlier this week. They call the approach ""assisted evolution."" Conservation is traditionally understood as, well, conservation — setting aside land where habitats can thrive free from human meddling. Ironically, this often requires a great deal of human meddling. Humans help endangered birds breed, then teach them their migratory routes, and maybe even develop complex markets to rent land for them to rest on during their flights. People have to drive (or shoot) salmon around stretches of river that have become too dry or dammed for them to pass on their own. The coral project goes a step further, proposing that we modify the animals themselves. Madeleine Van Oppen, a researcher at the Australian Institute of Marine Science and the lead author of the paper, acknowledges that this will be controversial. The idea of modifying a species and introducing it to the wild in the hopes that it crossbreeds and spreads is a departure from traditional conservation, with its focus on preservation and the elimination of invasive species. But it’s easy to see how you get there once you start thinking about how to deal with a problem as vast as climate change. Many reefs are already set aside as conservation areas, but that’s not enough when the entire ocean is changing at an unprecedented rate. Conservation often demands a great deal of human meddling ""Some people have objections in principle to any manipulations,"" says van Oppen, ""but I think these manipulations are pretty minor. Plus climate change demands it."" Even if these methods work, she says, ""We’ll never be able to preserve everything."" Coral reefs in the Caribbean, Australia, and elsewhere have seen drastic declines in recent years, as ocean water gets warmer and more acidic. They’re also under pressure from pollution, like nutrient runoff, and invasive predators, like coral-eating starfish. In Australia, a recent survey found that the Great Barrier Reef had lost over half its initial coral cover, and another study predicted that coral could decline to under 10 percent if warming trends continue. Much of that change is already locked into the climate system and would occur even if we manage to curb CO2 emissions tomorrow. (Obviously, it will be far worse if we don’t.) Van Oppen says we need to focus on reducing CO2, but we should also think about new ways of coping with change that at this point is inevitable. ""Climate change demands it."" ""We’re developing a toolbox,"" says van Oppen, emphasizing that any release of improved corals would only happen after extensive impact studies and public discussion. Van Oppen’s team is using a machine called the Sea Simulator to mimic the future state of the ocean. It's essentially a giant aquarium that allows researchers to tweak temperature, acidity, salinity, and other variables simultaneously. For example, van Oppen can expose her corals to the predicted ocean temperature and acidity of a reef off the coast of Australia, down to modeled ocean cycles, and grow them over a period of several years. By exposing coral to the hot, acidic water of future seas, van Oppen hopes to find corals that can weather the change, then breed them with other hardy types. Van Oppen will be crossing between closely related species, as well as within single species, looking for traits that confer resilience to climate change. And it’s not just the coral. Van Oppen will  also be attempting to manipulate the bacteria and algae that live within coral; they have a faster rate of evolution, and may play a role in the ability of coral to withstand high temperature. When coral ""bleaches,"" a symptom of stress, it’s because it jettisons its symbiotic algae, weakening its immune system. If more resilient algae can be evolved, the researchers hope, maybe it could make the coral more resilient too. ""We're developing a tool-box."" ""When we cross within species, we’re looking for individuals with certain traits,"" says van Oppen. ""When we cross different species, we’re just hoping we’re lucky and get some positive phenotypic results.""  She cites an example in the Caribbean, where two species of coral in highly damaged environments hybridized on their own. Such natural hybridization may occur more frequently than previously thought.  ""It happens naturally, we want to see if we can we harness these mechanisms to help the coral become more resilient."" Traditional conservation efforts already keep genetic diversity and adaptation in mind. The Nature Conservancy has been trying to restore dying reefs in the Caribbean for the last decade or so, partly by planting them with staghorn and elkhorn corals, which have seen massive die-offs since the 1980s. Right now they’re trying to collect genetically diverse samples and put them on the reef where they can breed and maybe evolve, says James Byrne, the Conservancy’s marine program manager. ""Our theory is that the remaining pool is too far apart to breed."" As for a more aggressive and intentional breeding program like the one being tested, Byrne says there may come a time when that’s necessary.

The law must now be approved by the House of Lords, the UK's upper house, reports CNN. If the law passes in the upper house, it may change ethical standards around genetic engineering. ""This is really good news — it's a triumph of common sense really."" ""This is really good news — it's a triumph of common sense really,"" says Alastair Kent, director of Genetic Alliance UK, a national charity that supports people with genetic conditions. ""It's one of those occasions when creating a regulatory framework that allows for the appliance of science for the benefit of people who live in insurmountable circumstances has made a real difference."" The vote was intended to allow women with mitochondrial disease conceive healthy babies. There are two kinds of DNA: nuclear, for which a person can thank both parents, and mitochondrial, which comes only from the mother. The technique for mitochondrial replacement uses DNA from three people. A woman donates an egg, and scientists replace her nuclear DNA — responsible for traits like height and hair color — with that of the prospective mother, while leaving the donor's mitochondrial DNA intact. Because mitochondria are located outside the nucleus, the resulting egg  contains only healthy mitochondrial DNA — 37 genes belonging to the  donor — as well as 25,000 genes from the prospective mother. The egg is then fertilized by the father. DNA from all three people would remain with the child for life. Mitochondria are the tiny, energy-producing ""batteries"" inside the cell, and are passed down only through the mother, unlike nuclear DNA, which draws from both parents. Mitochondrial disease occurs when the body's storehouses don't create enough energy, and is considered rare. So if a mother has mitochondrial disease, her child will have it too. About 6,500 children are born with faulty mitochondria worldwide each year. It can cause numerous health problems, including seizures, blindness, heart problems, and liver disease. Given these complications and the fact mitochondrial DNA is only passed on by women, potential mothers who suffer from mitochondrial disease often end up adopting or forgoing having children for fear of passing on a life-threatening disease. ""Mitochondrial disease is unimaginably cruel,"" mitochondrial disease advocacy groups wrote in an open letter to UK lawmakers this week, reports Reuters. ""It strips our children of the skills they have learned, inflicts pain that cannot be managed and tires their organs one by one until their little bodies cannot go on any more."" Children have already been born using a slightly different technique that injected donor mitochondrial DNA into eggs after fertilization — almost 30, from 1997 until 2003. The US FDA cracked down on the process in 2003, telling fertility clinics that genetically manipulated embryos are subject to regulation as a biological product. ""This would be the first case of intentionally manipulating a child's genome."" Some scientists worry that allowing the technique to take place would effectively legalize the creation of children that are genetically designed to avoid certain traits. ""This would be the first case of intentionally manipulating a child's genome,"" David King, director of Human Genetic Alert, a UK-based public watchdog group, told The Verge back in June. ""And we are crossing that line for the sake of what exactly? For a very small number of families who already have options that allow them to raise children."" Others worry about the legal issues that could arise from children with three genetic parents. Yet mitochondrial DNA only contributes 37 genes — a small number compared with the 25,000 genes that come from the affected mother. That small number shouldn’t a parent make, says Shoukhrat Militapov, a developmental biologist at the Oregon Health and Science University who used mitochondrial replacement to successfully breed four rhesus macaques. ""The woman who provides the mitochondria won't be a parent, because mitochondrial DNA isn't the part of the DNA that determines who we are,"" he told The Verge in June. The vote ""gives the HFEA the power to authorize mitochondrial replacement."" Once the law is approved, clinics will be able to submit an application to the Human Fertilization and Embryology Authority, which can decide if it's the right thing to do and if the proposal satisfies the ethical criteria, Kent says. ""[The law] basically gives the HFEA the power to authorize mitochondrial replacement."" UK Prime Minister David Cameron has spoken out in favor of the procedure. ""I think it has be thoroughly researched and tested, and as someone who had a severely disabled child myself, I know what parents go through when they are concerned about these issues,"" Cameron has said, reports the BBC. ""So science can help in this way, all the arguments are in favor, we should make sure these treatments are available."" The vote means that the UK is very close to allowing mitochondrial replacement to occur. As soon as the law is approved, the UK's Human Fertilization and Embryology Authority will be able to start to giving out licenses for the procedure, which means the first birth could take place in 2016. Correction: An earlier version of this article stated that the law had been fully approved by the UK government. That is incorrect. The law was approved by the House of Commons, but still needs to go through the House of Lords. The article has been changed to reflect the law's status.

Much of the connection between childhood stress and adult health is indirect, linked to unhealthy behaviors like smoking and drinking and weighs on body mass index and even socioeconomic status. However, there may still be a direct biological relationship between childhood trauma and adult health, which the scientists are still pursuing. ""These results come from a wider program of research where we're examining what we call the social and psychosocial environment,"" Michelle Kelly-Irving, a scientist at the French Institute of Health and Medical Research who co-authored the study, told The Verge. ""So, how the social and psychosocial environment get under our skin from the earliest moments of life and lead us along health trajectories, which can explain health inequalities all across the life course."" ""The psychosocial environment gets under our skin from the earliest moments of life."" Today's study draws its findings from data culled from the National Childhood Development Study (NCDS), an ongoing series of surveys that follows the lives of 17,000 people born in 1958 in Great Britain. Kelly-Irving and her colleagues collected information on more than 7,000 men and women from the NCDS who experienced toxic traumas like poor nourishment or physical abuse by seven, 11, or 16 years of age, and compared that data to their quality of life at 23 and 33. The results show that, by age 44, adults had carried higher stress levels from childhood on through adulthood, having an indirect impact on healthful decision-making, wealth, education level, and BMI. There is already a growing body of work concerning childhood stress and how trauma can affect people as they develop, and today's study helps reinforce that literature. In the mid-1990s, the CDC and Kaiser Permanente HMO conducted the seminal Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE) Study, which gathered information from more than 17,000 adults about their past experiences with abuse, neglect, and family dysfunction. The study found that negative childhood experiences can lead to alcoholism and chronic illnesses like heart disease in adulthood. Multiple studies have added to the ACE Study's findings in the years since. The relationship between early-life trauma and stress later in life is mostly, but only in part, expressed through unhealthy behaviors, BMI, and socioeconomic status, the researchers say. Whether or not there is a direct biological link is plausible but unclear right now, though some research suggests that stress may have lasting effects on the nervous, endocrine, and immune systems. More work needs to be done to determine if that link definitively exists. An important step forward ""I think this study is an important step forward,"" said Jamie Hanson, a postdoctoral fellow at the Center for Developmental Science at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. Hanson co-authored a study published in Biological Psychiatry last year on how early life stress impacts parts of the brain. ""We know that stress is related to negative health outcomes. Now, we can say adversity at [age] five can affect decisions made at 25, and that might be contributing to stroke risk at 50."" The researchers now hope that today's results provide reason for more research to take place in new contexts, like in developing nations, to better understand trauma's effects. From a public health standpoint, the study's findings might also be used in concert with the research already being published to help enact policies that can help intervene in abusive environments.",0.870938801004164,0.129061198995836,0.8719160113726833,587,5.3645655877342415,344,6.2383720930232558,0,0,"Science, Report",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

As for the solutions? Whether you want communities to preserve absolute free speech or police the trolls, Pao suggests you probably won't be satisfied. As Pao bluntly puts it, ""the trolls are winning"" online. ""The foundations of the internet were laid on free expression, but the founders just did not understand how effective their creation would be for the coordination and amplification of harassing behavior,"" she writes. ""Or that young people would come to see this bullying as the norm — as something to emulate in an effort to one-up each other."" Pao herself has been the subject of unusually intense hatred from Redditors, including messages that board member Sam Altman called ""sickening."" She's since said that other Redditors' messages of support have helped balance the threats and insults. ""The trolls are winning."" Now that she's no longer in charge of Reddit, Pao seems a little more open about the nearly intractable problems it (and other communities) faces, especially when they're expected to make money.

""No one has figured out the best place to draw the line between bad and ugly — or whether that line can support a viable business model."" In short, the hands-off approach will let trolls run rampant. But the hands-on approach will either shut down meaningful discussion or let horrible things slip through. There's no winning, unless you're a troll yourself. All Reddit can do is muddle through.

The company said it formed an ""anomaly investigation board"" to ascertain the cause of the explosion, but was yet to work out exactly what went wrong.

The Antares rocket would have launched a Cygnus spacecraft to resupply the International Space Station; this would have been Orbital's third resupply mission. The rocket was carrying 1360 pounds (617 kg) of food for the astronauts aboard the ISS, as well as flight crew equipment, science equipment for the US and international science communities, spacewalk equipment and hardware.

Shares of the company plummeted after market to $25.65, after closing at $30.37. Today's launch was the third of eight missions it's contracted for, at a total of $1.9 billion for all the flights.

One place where that unavoidably happens is in the intersections of city streets, where pedestrians, bikers, and drivers meet — sometimes violently. To try to tackle this problem, AT&T partnered with the NYU Rudin Center for Transportation, the NYC Department of Transportation, educational co-op General Assembly, and software competition site ChallengePost to create Connected Intersections, a four-month developer challenge with the goal of inspiring technologies that can make city streets safer for distracted humans buried in their phones and the people around them. ""Traffic lights can only do so much."" ""Pedestrians and cars are kind of at an impasse right now, and it’s getting to a point where real action needs to be taken,"" Sarah Kaufman of the Rudin Center said at one of the challenge’s developer open houses back in July. ""Every two hours a New Yorker is hurt or badly injured, and every 30 hours one is killed in a car crash. So it’s at a point where we have a big opportunity to start using smart technologies to put the power in the people’s hands. Why not put safety in people’s hands? Traffic lights can only do so much."" Connected Intersections ended up collecting 45 ideas from teams in 13 different countries and 26 different states. Eight teams were awarded different prizes for their ideas in two categories: solutions for drivers, and solutions for pedestrians and cyclists. The winning solutions were as diverse as the teams themselves, ranging from proximity-based Bluetooth notifications to the gamification of safe driving.   Romanian native Tudor Cobalas — one of the team members for the SafeDrive app, winner of the Large Organization Recognition Award — was one of a number of international contestants. His team’s app eschews many of the proximity-based solutions that other submissions featured and focuses solely on awarding points to drivers who are traveling over a certain speed while not engaging with their phone. The goal is to create partnerships with companies which will allow drivers to redeem those points for discounts on products or services. ""Until now we have been self-funded and we have checked important milestones on the local market,"" he said, ""and we are open for any proposition on how to capitalize on these responsible points."" Cobalas’ interest also came from a personal connection to the core issue of safety: after a close call while texting and driving in 2013, he shared his experience with teammate Eduard Alexandrian, who created the app.   Another entrant with a personal tie to intersection safety was Peter Pottier. The New York City-born developer was biking when he got hit by a car making an illegal left turn, a problem that could have been solved with his team’s Rider Alert gadget. Adapted from his last project — a connected bike horn (think ringtones for your bike) — Rider Alert is an attachable piece of hardware that uses Bluetooth to alert drivers with an audio / visual alert via the corresponding app that a biker is nearby. The goal is to increase awareness even if the two parties aren’t heading straight for each other. ""We want to have a two-way buy-in where people are conscientious about their driving habits and bikers can feel safer riding,"" he told me as he demonstrated the app last week. He believes that his team’s solution would increase rider safety and in turn encourage more biking in general, and that the hardware could be modified to fit more than just bikes, and in the future could keep runners safe, or even pets from being struck.   The biggest winner of the contest was the team that created Tug, who took home the Popular Choice and Grand Prize awards in the Pedestrians & Cyclists category with a combination of an app and an infrastructure solution that contextually reminds people to look up at crosswalk signals. ""What we’ve basically done is extend the traffic signals to the phone itself,"" Dan Levine of the Tug team told me. ""This would involve placing Bluetooth modules in the pedestrian posts that have a certain radius determined by urban planners, and when you’re in that region approaching the crosswalk and the orange hand is lit, you’ll get the signal."" Like a child tugging on a parent's arm The signal is a red overlay on your screen that tells a user to ""Look UP!"" — an alert which can only be triggered when a phone’s screen is active and the crosswalk is telling pedestrians to stop. The name comes from the comparative action of a child tugging on a parent’s arm to get their attention, and it reflects the solution’s simplicity, possibly the reason Tug won the Popular Choice award in the Solutions for Pedestrians & Cyclists category. ""We went through multiple iterations of different designs,"" Levine said of his team, comprised entirely of Cornell Tech graduate students, ""but the place we were working from [Cornell Tech is temporarily based in Google’s NYC office] had a window which gave a very clear view of the crosswalk, so we would just sit there and watch people."" The team would then leave their third-floor perch and go down to the crosswalk and ask people everyday questions based on the team’s observations. ""We would have people go through their own stories, and then through their stories you get little details, little snippets that tell you things,"" Levine said.  The contest generated dozens of smart ideas, but right now the results are not much more than tech demos. While some apps might be available soon, most teams need wide adoption to make an impact; those that require infrastructure changes, meanwhile, could face decades of red tape. When I asked everyone what’s next for their projects, many developers spoke about incremental progress like using prize money to hire more team members, or to begin prototyping hardware. A handful were scheduling coffee dates with people from AT&T and ChallengePost. ChallengePost CEO Brandon Kessler said that helping companies get off the ground was part of the reason the contest was started in the first place. ""We power a lot of competitions and many, many times we see businesses going on to grow really big, get funding and get purchased by companies, and we would not be surprised if that happened here at all."" For now, New Yorkers will just have to do things the old-fashioned way: look both ways before you cross.",0.5740367508072093,0.4259632491927907,0.8545093119216607,1102,4.9618874773139749,583,6.1886792452830193,0,6,"Mobile, Tech, Transportation, Report",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

Many states already ban automakers from not using the dealership model, but Tesla's skirting of those rules has prompted new laws that further clamp down on the practice. The ban in Michigan is actually so thorough that Tesla says it is even prohibited from operating galleries within the state, which is what the automaker has done elsewhere so that it can at least present its cars and information on them. Snyder says that Michigan isn't actually banning direct sales with this law, but that it's merely clarifying an existing law.

A Texas jury determined Monday that the manufacturer, Trinity Industries, changed the design of its guardrails in 2005 without notifying the Federal Highway Administration. The company then sold its systems to state governments who then received federal reimbursement. At issue is a decision to narrow the width of Trinity's rail head from five inches to four. State regulators have alleged that this change raises the risk of guardrails piercing cars (and passengers) during collisions. Plaintiffs in at least 14 other lawsuits claim that the changes to Trinity's guardrail design led to five deaths and several injuries. Internal company documents show that the change saved the company about $2 on every rail head, the part of the guardrail usually marked in black and yellow.   Federal law requires companies to immediately notify the Federal Highway Administration of any design changes. Trinity maintains that the change does not pose any safety risks, and that its failure to disclose it was accidental. Four states — Missouri, Massachusetts, Nevada, and Virginia — have already banned Trinity's ET-Plus rail head due to safety concerns. The Federal Highway Administration has continued to approve the design and reviewed crash tests to determine they were eligible for federal reimbursement, though the Times reported this month that there were internal doubts about its safety. This month, the agency asked state governments to report crashes involving the ET-Plus. A spokesman said this week that the administration will evaluate the case to determine whether it affects the system's eligibility. The jury this week awarded $175 million to Joshua Hartman, a Trinity Industries competitor who filed the lawsuit on behalf of the federal government under the False Claims Act. That sum will be tripled to $525 million, as stipulated under federal law, and will be shared between Hartman and the government. The judge hearing the case will determine any additional penalties against the company. Trinity says it will appeal the decision, adding, in a statement, that it ""cannot and will not withstand legal scrutiny.""",0.3260443127478222,0.6739556872521778,0.8953356731292458,374,5.3850267379679142,223,6.3183856502242151,0,2,"Policy & Law, Transportation, US & World",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

The Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat, an international body that determines the heights of skyscrapers, has ruled that the spire atop One World Trade is an architecturally significant feature of the building — not an antenna. Council chairman Timothy Johnson said that the spire was clearly ""the end of the architectural expression of the building,"" adding at a press conference today that ""for us it was very clear that it was a spire and not an antenna."" Johnson is also a partner at NBBJ, a global architecture firm. The decision makes the official height of the building 1,776 feet, not 1,368 feet, which is the height of the building's roof. It also allows One World Trade to beat out Chicago's Willis Tower as the tallest in the US. Willis Tower's antenna does not count towards its official ""architectural height."" Internationally, the Council is now projecting that One World Trade will be the third tallest building in the world upon completion, behind the 2,717-foot Burj Khalifa and the 1,972-foot Makkah Royal Clock Tower Hotel in Mecca.  A unanimous decision One World Trade Center's spire doesn't include any radio or broadcast equipment — it only features decorative lighting — and that fact seems to have helped it win the Council's favor. Johnson explained that ""having been on the roof of the World Trade, this is essentially a small building up there,"" referring to the spire. He added that a small lightning rod and a light above the spire that serves to warn airplanes do not count towards the height, and the 1,776-foot measurement does not include those minor functional pieces of equipment. The 25-person Council, comprised of architects, engineers, contractors, academics, and suppliers, met on November 8th in Chicago to make a decision, and as it typically does, the council re-evaluated its criteria before making a ruling. The team concluded that the rules were valid, and then made the unanimous decision to rule that the spire was not an antenna. As for the actual measurement 1,776 feet, the Council relies on One World Trade's architectural plans. This means that the team is ""basically taking the word of the architects and engineers,"" as Johnson explained, noting that the procedure is the same for all other skyscrapers. There are three different height criteria used by the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat: ""height to the architectural top,"" ""highest occupied floor,"" and ""height to tip."" The Willis Tower beats out One World Trade for the highest occupied floor, at 1,354 feet vs. 1,268 feet. Only the architectural height is used to determine the tallest buildings in the world, however, and it's also the most controversial. This measurement officially includes spires, but not ""antennae, signage, flag poles or other functional-technical equipment."" ""For us it was very clear that it was a spire and not an antenna."" Not only does One World Trade's spire not include functional equipment, it also is perceived as a permanent fixture on the building. Antennas like that found on Willis Tower have been swapped out and removed in the past. Indeed, the Willis Tower — called the Sears Tower at the time — had its two antennas added in the early '80s, close to ten years after the building's completion. In 2000 one of the antennas was replaced with a taller antenna for improved reception. The spire on One World Trade, in contrast, is made of stainless steel and is integrated into the building's design, according to the Council. Should it ever be replaced or repurposed as an antenna, the Council would revisit its decision, according to Johnson. The decision was clearly fraught with political interest, and some may point to those forces as influencing the decision today. Johnson said in light of the pressure that ""we were very happy that our conclusion was that we were able to ratify that that was the height of the building.""",0.7342431217919345,0.2657568782080655,0.862150535073499,672,5.010416666666667,326,6.2638036809815949,0,0,"Design, US & World, Architecture, Report",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

ImageQuilts is a Chrome extension that acts as a plug-in for Google Images. After installing the app, you'll see a new button appear above your image-search results, prompting you to make an ImageQuilt. Clicking on the button jumps you into an intuitive interface that lets you build a collage based on the results of your search. There are lots of customization options: you can change the image size, and order; zoom into images; remove images; and also choose between grayscale, inverted, or full-color displays. After tinkering around with the settings and removing irrelevant images, you're left with a coherent (and hopefully attractive) collage that represents your chosen subject.  There are some great examples of how powerful ImageQuilts can be over at the plug-in's website, but we've put a few of their examples together with a few of our own below. As you'll notice, some are more successful than others; but when choosing an architect, designer, or artist, ImageQuilts does a superb job of capturing their essence.  The same can (generally) be said for simple phrases and nouns, such as ""scrap metal dumping"" or ""candy,"" but when searching for products you'll often get a mess of concepts and press shots mixed in with images that Google Images has pulled from news articles, making the job of curating the collage a little cumbersome. There's also no simple way to export or share your collages — you'll have to just take a screenshot of the results. Complaints aside, ImageQuilts is a great tool for summarizing and organizing visual data. A viewer scanning over, for example, an artist's ImageQuilt will quickly understand what they're about. Tufte suggests that viewers will often learn more about a topic from ImageQuilts than conventional search results.

Despite huge leaps forward in comfort for the upper classes (and the more recent ""premium economy"" class), the economy section of a cabin is more often than not cramped, packed, and charmless. British design firm Seymourpowell has a seating concept that it believes will change that. It's called Morph. ""Passengers who can afford premium, business or first class have a choice and hence some control over their own experience,"" says Seymourpowell's head of transport Jeremy White. ""Morph is a solution – a standard product that meets the needs of lots of different kinds of people."" The pitch is simple: Morph can, quite literally, morph to best serve those who are using it.  Rather than a trio of individual seats, each made of several pieces of fabric and foam, Morph is better described as a bench. A single piece of fabric is stretched across to form the seats, and another forms the back of the chair. The individual seats are designated using armrests and dividers to clamp the fabric in place.  Instead of moving the entire seat back to adjust the pitch of the chair, mechanized seat formers are positioned under the fabric, allowing users to decide the recline and support that best fits them. Because the back of the seat is fixed in place, the seat in front of you will never be reclined. ""The semantics of the architecture and visual cues indicate that the back of the seat belongs to the passenger facing it,"" explains the firm. There are also fold-out sections that extend the width of armrests, which Seymourpowell says increases a passenger's sense of independence and control over their own space. The concept of static seats and the suggestion that they will provide a more pleasant flight experience is interesting, but it's not mind-blowing. Where Morph comes into its own is in the flexibility of its design. By moving the dividers that define each seat, airline staff can effectively tailor each bench for its occupants. All three seats take up 54 inches of width — a fairly standard economy bench size. When shared between a trio of passengers, that offers 18 inches each. However, there are times when we don't require three equal seats.  Seymourpowell offers up the example of a couple traveling with a child. The father, presumably larger than the rest of the family, could take 20 inches, the mother keeps the standard 18 inches, and the child takes 16 inches. This simple adjustment gives the father more lateral space than almost any major airline would offer in economy, at no extra expense to the family. With some economy airlines charging significantly more to sit in an exit row or close to the front of the plane, it's easy to envisage the second scenario Seymourpowell offers up becoming a reality. Morph's design allows for the central seat to be made as small as 10 inches wide. This creates two 22-inch seats, offering airlines and passengers a ""premium"" row for those would like to pay more for the space. This configuration could also potentially save money for overweight people, some of whom buy two adjacent seats when traveling.   In all of the configurations, the seat formers and adjusting mechanisms move with the dividers (they're also on rails) to form a new seat. Although Seymourpowell has partnered with many companies to bring products to market, Morph is just an initial concept. There are countless safety regulations, tests, and potential modifications to be made before an airline can consider using the seating in one of their planes. What it does do is start a conversation. When flying, all our needs are different. Some may not mind taking a small seat to save money, while others may wish to take a larger seat to work through a long flight. Airlines currently can't offer such flexibility to their passengers. Morph could provide the opportunity for operators to maximize their profits, and, more importantly to most, give passengers greater control over their journey.",0.6393886753330063,0.36061132466699375,0.2053267315018361,681,4.8869309838472832,378,6.0105820105820102,0,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Regular PET, although recyclable, is created using petroleum, a finite resource. The fabric in Ford's new car replaces the PET used to make polyester with Coca-Cola's PlantBottle PET. PlantBottle replaces petroleum with sugar cane ethanol Coca-Cola says it's already distributed over 18 billion PlantBottle packages, saving 400,000 barrels of oil in the process, and notes that if the new fabric were to be used across the majority of US Ford models it would save a further 6,000 barrels.

Even worse, there didn't seem to be a clear fix for the attack. Anyone who plugged in a USB stick was opening themselves up to the attack, and because the bad code was residing in USB firmware, it was hard to protect against it without completely redesigning the system. The only good news was that Nohl and Lell didn't publish the code, so the industry had some time to prepare for a world without USB. ""You have to prove to the world that it's practical."" As of this week, that's no longer true. In a joint talk at DerbyCon, Adam Caudill and Brandon Wilson announced they had successfully reverse-engineered BadUSB, and they didn't share Nohl and Lell's concerns about publishing the code. The pair has published the code on GitHub, and demonstrated various uses for it, including an attack that takes over a user's keyboard input and turns control over to the attacker. According to Caudill, the motive for the release was to put pressure on manufacturers. ""If the only people who can do this are those with significant budgets, the manufacturers will never do anything about it,"" he told Wired's Andy Greenberg. ""You have to prove to the world that it’s practical, that anyone can do it."" Adam Caudill and Brandon Wilson's DerbyCon presentation Still, the net effect is unlikely to be a push for USB security. As long as attackers can reprogram USB firmware, attacks like this will be a serious threat. The only way to fix the vulnerability is a new layer of security around firmware, but that would mean a full update to the USB standard itself, which mean years of insecurity. However the industry responds, we're likely to be living with it for a long, long time. In the meantime, any time you plug a USB drive into your computer, you'll be opening up a huge vector of attack. It's easy to imagine a pile of dirty USBs being dumped onto a table at CES or desk at your local Kinko's. Unless you can track a device's provenance from the factory to your computer, the only real protection avoiding USB drives and devices at every turn — covering over your USB ports the same way you might cover your laptop camera.

Lanier is a leading critic of the internet’s advertising-based business models, and when Facebook’s acquisition of Oculus Rift came up, he pushed the company to look for alternative sources of revenue. ""Every time there is a new platform, there is a chance to create a new economic model,"" Lanier said. The desire for an alternative to Facebook goes most of the way in explaining the overnight sensation that is Ello, a three-month-old social network founded on the idea that ad-based internet businesses are corrupt. The service, which has yet to build a mobile app and is available only on the web, exploded in popularity this month after reports that artists and LGBT people were fleeing Facebook in favor of Ello, because unlike Facebook it allows them to use pseudonyms. A torrent of press coverage and commentary followed, and the currently invite-only network now has a waiting list of 1 million people. Founded on the idea that ad-based social networks are corrupt With this new platform comes the kind of chance Lanier talked about: an opportunity to create a service that succeeds without demanding ever more data about our personal lives. It’s an idea contained in Ello’s founding manifesto, which promises ""a better way."" ""Collecting and selling your personal data, reading your posts to your friends, and mapping your social connections for profit is both creepy and unethical,"" the company says on its About page. ""Under the guise of offering a ‘free’ service, users pay a high price in intrusive advertising and lack of privacy."" At this early stage, Ello offers a clean, modernist design with a bare-bones feature set. Its users post a motley assemblage of photos, one-liners, and disjointed conversations among early adopters. But really, Ello is a dream of starting over — a blank slate where you can create the network that has so far eluded you. Ad-free and pseudonym-friendly, it’s a place where you can easily toggle between your real friends and everyone else — ""Noise,"" as Ello calls them — and where your sharing and messaging are never interrupted by the sight of an unwanted brand. For now, there’s a lot about Ello that’s simply weird. When you log in, your screen is split into two main tabs. The left side of your screen shows you large circular avatars of the people you follow, in a highly inconvenient and basically useless reverse-chronological order from the point that you followed them. (All you can do with the avatars is click them to see the person’s feed of updates; it’s as if half your favorite website was taken up by its blogroll.) The right side of the feed is where you’ll find the posts of the people you follow, and it’s full of posts of every length, from simple greetings to extended essays.   There are photos there, as well, and animated GIFs; Ello has said it welcomes porn, so you may see some of that, too. Replies appear in your feed even when the person you follow is responding to someone you don’t; but you don’t get notified when someone responds to you, because there’s no system for notifications. As with any new network, early adopters are fond of using it to discuss the network itself: users are suggesting interesting accounts to follow; sharing tips (hit shift+1 to make your friends’ faces take up the entire screen!); and complaining about missing features (no block feature; no private messaging). Ello is half-formed Ello is half-formed, if that. It’s buggy, the search function doesn’t work, and the site has been plagued by down time in recent days — although perhaps not as much as you would expect, given how quickly it has been growing. There are no mobile apps for Ello as of yet; instead there’s a mobile web client that works well enough. Founders say that users will eventually pay for the service via small fees for extra features — a few dollars for emoji or the ability to control multiple accounts from a single login. That will start to repay the $435,000 the company raised from FreshTracks Capital, a venture capital firm in Vermont. And over time, the founders say, they hope Ello evolves into a full-fledged alternative to existing networks. Something will probably kill Ello before any of that happens, of course. But what if it doesn’t? Could this time be different? Ello was conceived by a team led by Paul Budnitz, a 47-year-old artist and maker of designer toys. He previously founded Kidrobot, a shop for unusual children’s toys, and Budnitz Bicycles, a maker of custom city bikes. Budnitz and some friends wanted to discuss projects they were working on, but were unsatisfied with existing tools. Teaming with the design firm Berger & Föhr and the software developers at Mode Set, Budnitz shepherded the first version of Ello into existence. After teasing the site in April, he began extending invitations to the public in July, and the momentum built from there.  Ello founder Paul Budnitz. On Thursday, amid reports that drag queens were moving from Facebook to Ello so that they could post under their stage names, Ello was receiving 4,000 signup requests an hour. By Friday, that number was up to 40,000 requests per hour, and that number held steady through Monday, according to a spokesman. It has proven especially popular in privacy-conscious Germany, Ello says, though most of its users are from the United States. 40,000 sign-up requests per hour The network’s rise was accompanied with growing skepticism that Ello could deliver on its promise of a private, ad-free network that remained mostly free to use. The writer and festival organizer Andy Baio was the first to note that Ello had raised venture capital without disclosing it on their site; he argued the company would find it difficult to sustain its operations unless it quickly raised more. (Ello’s paid features have yet to arrive.) Meanwhile, writer Quinn Norton highlighted the huge number of problems social networks face as they grow. ""The code won’t scale. The revenue model won’t be quite right. The hosting will be problematic. People will blame you for bigotry, hate, and even aiding human rights abusers and criminals … and that’s just what happens if people love you."" So what happens if Ello succeeds? It’s going to need money in a hurry. It’s going to need to hire quickly to address all the issues Norton raises, and more. The founders seem aware of this; they declined my interview request, saying they were working around the clock to keep Ello from falling apart. Much of the skepticism about Ello focuses on a single fact: networks founded on the premise of enhanced privacy have never resonated with a mass audience. People say they value privacy and then volunteer their entire life histories to Facebook. Google+ launched ad-free with a ""Circles"" model designed to encourage more private sharing; it never took off, and after the departure from Google of its creator, it has been all but in maintenance mode. Path, a four-year-old social network for mobile devices, is moribund in the United States. But the closest analog to Ello may be Diaspora, which raised $200,000 on Kickstarter in an effort to create a private, ad-free Facebook alternative. The resulting product floundered, though, and its creators left the project less than two years after starting it. Interest motivated less by privacy than novelty But the early interest in Ello seems motivated less by privacy than it is by novelty. Part of the appeal for early adopters — aside from the predictable land rush for desirable user names — is trying to figure out what Ello is, or could be. It’s a chance to rebuild your network of friends from scratch, to find an audience more in tune with your interests, and (for now) to escape the heavy brand presence found on every other form of media. It’s a place to mess around. What it lacks in features, though, it makes up for in possibility — the sense that Ello could be anything its users want it to be. What’s most interesting about these ad-free social networks isn’t that they keep failing but rather that they keep returning. This time it will be different, we tell ourselves. And the fact that it never is won’t stop us from trying again.",0.5984233393977254,0.4015766606022746,0.5239981896439349,1413,4.9419674451521587,730,6.2000000000000002,0,6,"Business, Culture, Tech, Report",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

At the most basic level this creates two simpler, more focused companies — but the real impetus for an independent PayPal is more likely the rapidly maturing ecosystem of digital wallets and mobile payments, especially Apple Pay, which threatens to eat PayPal’s business from the inside out.  PayPal emerged as an early leader in the online payment space in the late 1990s by solving the nascent problem of fast, secure transactions on the web. More recently it — well, technically eBay—acquired Braintree, giving it a sizable foothold in the fast-growing world of mobile and in-app payments. And it has consistently been the most widely used service among consumers in the still-young market for digital wallets: a ComScore study from last year found that PayPal was the brand consumers preferred, with six times the usage of the second-place service, Google Wallet. PayPal's stellar growth wasn't reflected in eBay's stock price But PayPal’s stellar growth wasn’t reflected in eBay’s stock price, which has vastly underperformed its peers. That meant PayPal had fewer resources with which to compete. Activist investors like Carl Icahn have been advocating for a breakup, arguing that there was tremendous market value in PayPal that couldn’t be realized while it was inside eBay. For months his demands were rejected, and Icahn eventually backed down, but it seems that he planted a seed which, along with recent events, finally prompted eBay’s board to approve the split.  ""The pace of change accelerated in the past six months."" eBay’s leadership acknowledged this morning that PayPal has to be more aggressive and agile as it digs in for the battle ahead. ""The pace of change accelerated in the past six months,"" eBay CEO John Donahoe told the New York Times, citing the emergence of Apple Pay and Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba as new competitive threats. Spinning off as a newly public company will likely give PayPal extra financial firepower in the form of stock that is expected to trade at a much higher price-to-earnings ratio than eBay’s current shares. PayPal will need that equity to make aggressive moves, including acquisitions and hires.  While the decision to breakup the two companies has been in discussion at eBay for a while, it’s hard to ignore the timing in relation to Apple Pay. The finance and tech sectors don’t necessarily have the best track record for working with one another, which makes Pay unique: it has the incumbent credit card companies like Visa, MasterCard, Discover and American Express working hand-in-glove with the biggest name in technology. The threat to PayPal is this: consumers who adopt Apple Pay to replace their physical wallet may also use it as their check-out option when making purchases inside apps. If Apple Pay performs well, it could also be extended to the web, threatening PayPal’s core business. (Apple listed six recommended payment partners developers could use with its payment service, but PayPal’s Braintree was not among them.)  Can a former AmEx exec help PayPal compete with credit cards?  The key for PayPal will be ensuring that it’s front and center across the web, mobile, and physical stores. That’s why it’s bringing in a veteran of the plastic world, Dan Schulman, formerly a senior executive at American Express. Before that, Schulman was a president at Sprint and the founding CEO of Virgin Mobile, experience that will be key to integrating the worlds of web, in-app, and in-store payments, crafting a single service consumers can use no matter where they’re spending money. Where does this all leave eBay? Not in a great place. PayPal was the biggest driver of revenue growth at the company and a key part of making the transition from web to mobile. eBay will now have to battle Goliaths like Amazon and Alibaba on the strength of its e-commerce alone.

By now, patches have been issued and most of the major systems have been secured. The bug even got its own Heartbleed-esque moniker: Shellshock. But there's still a lot that isn't clear about the bug, and what went on in the brief window in which attackers could exploit the public vulnerability on unpatched systems. Given a dangerously large window of opportunity, how much damage did Shellshock do? The web-optimization company CloudFlare has been tracking exploits closely, and as of last night, the company says it had blocked roughly 1.1 million Shellshock attacks. More than 80% of the attacks were reconnaissance attacks designed to compile a list of vulnerable machines. Since servers using Cloudflare were protected, the chain stopped there, but it's reasonable to assume that unprotected networks were exposed to much more extensive attacks once the reconnaissance was successful. Strangely, the vast majority came from French IP addresses, although it's difficult to say whether the attackers were located there or the traffic was simply being routed through.  CloudFlare analysis of network attacks ""We have not seen [an attack]... that would make the average Macbook user hackable."" OS X also uses the Bash shell, leading to concerns that Apple hardware might be attacked en masse — but a week later, those fears have not panned out. When Shellshock emerged, Apple said that ""the vast majority of OS are not at risk,"" and so far the research has confirmed that claim. ""We have not seen proof of any attack at this time that would make the average MacBook user readily hackable,"" says FireEye research scientist James Bennett. ""Although Bash was vulnerable, the public was not aware of any way OS X exposed Bash to attacker-supplied input with its pre-installed software."" Of course, someone might still discover a vulnerability that would provide an easy way in, but with the patch already published, it's unlikely to do much damage. In the wild, the vast majority of attacks have been against web-facing servers, which were vulnerable to easily executed HTTP-based attacks. Macs didn't offer any obvious points of weakness, which seems to have convinced most attackers to focus on the servers. The most damage came from unexpected lines of attack, like a novel attack discovered by FireEye that used Shellshock to sidestep traditional computers entirely. Instead, the attackers targeted Network Attached Storage devices (NAS), essentially a large, networked hard drive. Since the NAS devices used Bash to communicate across the network, attackers were able to access any data on the device, and append their own SSH key to the ""authorized_keys"" file, building in a backdoor that could be exploited later. It's an unexpected line of attack but as networks become larger and more varied, growing to include more embedded devices, it's an attack many experts expect we'll see over and over again. The most alarming aspect is that, for successful attacks, it's hard to say how far the damage reached. For every ten reconnaissance attacks stopped by CloudFlare, there's at least one that got through, and researchers are still piecing out the net effect of all those harvested credentials and compromised systems. We may have stopped the vulnerability within a week, but the damage will likely be playing out for months or even years to come.",0.34245322039166726,0.6575467796083327,0.19451698836748163,571,5.1996497373029769,329,6.0334346504559271,0,2,"Apple, Business, Report",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

Announced yesterday, the TechHire Initiative is a mix of agreements between the government and private companies in more than 20 different areas, as well as $100 million in federal investments. The end goal is to get Americans training to work in higher-paying technology jobs. The program aims to train people in skills such as coding, both through the universities and colleges that have traditionally produced tech workers, but also through nontraditional online training courses and bootcamps. The government is working with business advisory groups to construct both an aptitude test employers can use to gauge candidates who have completed nontraditional courses, and a guide for recruiting tech workers who aren't necessarily computer science graduates from four-year universities. Two-thirds of the country's tech jobs are in unrelated sectors such as healthcare — the new guidelines are expected to help employers choose candidates they might not have found before. The focus is on nontraditional courses and bootcamps for tech training To support the initiative, the Obama administration will offer $100 million in grants to training programs that help individuals with barriers to training, such as disabilities, child care responsibilities, and limited English proficiency. Groups in the private sector have also committed to offer free training courses and expanded coding bootcamps to low-income individuals and groups underserved and underrepresented in tech, including women, minorities, and veterans. Cities with close ties to tech such as San Francisco and Los Angeles were among the 21 communities that committed to the government's new scheme, but the group also includes areas without established ties to the tech industry, such as rural Eastern Kentucky, Memphis, and Albuquerque.

A separate presentation showed how a modified OS X updater could be used to install keyloggers on Mac computers. Another from 2011 discussed different methods that could be used to hack Apple's Group ID (GID) — one of the two encryption keys that Apple places on its mobile devices.

Once their methodology was refined, the authors determined there were between 46,000 and 70,000 ISIS supporters on Twitter, but noted, ""We believe the truth is closer to the low end of the range."" But quantity doesn't necessarily determine impact. Although many ISIS supporters have at least 1,000 followers — more than the average US user — no single account can match the impact of many US politicians and celebrities. The Times reports that traffic from ISIS supporters is responsible for only ""one or two hundredths of a percentage point"" of Twitter's total. So, although ISIS may be savvy social media propagandists, their reach is still small, especially when compared to the 61.2 million followers of Justin Bieber. Because of the nature of Twitter, the authors ran into several challenges while collecting data. Over the course of four months, many ISIS accounts were suspended by Twitter, voluntarily deleted, set to private, or renamed. The study attempted to remove outlier followers (like journalists and academic researchers) from their final count, but did not try to remove multiple Twitter handles run by the same user. The authors said they believed these repeated accounts made up less than 1 percent of the total data. At the same time, Twitter says it has moved aggressively to suspend accounts that may be run by extremist organizations. While the Brookings study suggested Twitter had suspended at least 1,000 accounts run by Islamic State supporters during the course of the study, executives at the network told the Times that the real number of suspensions is much higher. Twitter says it is aggressively suspending accounts Earlier this week, it was reported that ISIS was sending death threats to Twitter staff, but the veracity of those threats have not been confirmed. Morgan and Berger note that their findings are more of a ""starting point for future research"" than indisputable facts.",0.5988691996363743,0.4011308003636257,0.8657726616557783,502,5.1812749003984067,278,6.0611510791366907,0,0,"Culture, US & World, Web",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

Last week, a California court ordered defunct political group Straight Pride UK to pay around $25,000 for telling WordPress.com to take down an interview with a student journalist, falsely claiming to hold a copyright on the material. While the group has apparently all but disappeared, it's a strike against an unfortunately common tactic: abusing automated takedown systems in order to make bad press go away. In 2013, writer Oliver Hotham contacted Straight Pride UK, whose attempts to ""raise awareness of being straight, and being PROUD to be heterosexual"" had been covered by BuzzFeed earlier in the year. Hotham described himself as a freelance journalist and asked questions via email, publishing the responses on his WordPress blog. After the post began to gain traction (and negative attention), though, the group told Hotham that Straight Pride UK had not consented to have the email published. Then, he filed a DMCA takedown notice, saying Hotham had infringed on its copyright. ""Within a few days WordPress caved to them without question, removing my article and telling me if I tried to publish it again I'd be suspended,"" he wrote in a followup post. Because of the volume of posted material and takedown requests, most major platforms (like WordPress, YouTube, or Google Search) use either automated systems or ones with minimal oversight. This makes DMCA notices a tempting way to suppress criticism or unflattering details — it's particularly identified with the Church of Scientology, which is thought to have sent thousands of takedown notices for YouTube videos and accounts. Users can challenge takedowns and have content reinstated or go to court, but Hotham wrote that he didn't have the time or money to deal with a potential legal fight. Company hopes people will ""think twice"" about abusing the DMCA takedown system A few months later, though, Hotham's case became part of Automattic's attempt to strike back against DMCA abuse. The company filed two complaints: one against a person who had plagiarized and then filed a complaint against the research watchdog site Retraction Watch, and one against Straight Pride UK press officer Nick Steiner. The case against Steiner noted that Hotham had clearly identified himself as a journalist when requesting an interview and that the reply was marked ""press statement,"" indicating a public release. Hotham was also publishing excerpts of the interview specifically to criticize and comment on them, something that the ""fair use"" copyright exemption explicitly protects. ""While there are no legal consequences (like fines) under the DMCA for copyright abusers, there is a provision that allows victims of censorship (and their web hosts) to bring legal action against those who submit fraudulent DMCA notices,"" wrote Automattic. The courts agreed, awarding Hotham and Automattic attorney's fees as well as damages for the time and work wasted on a false claim. It's unlikely that they'll ever see this money. Straight Pride UK quickly went dark, and Steiner couldn't be found and served with a complaint. This is still a better outcome than the Retraction Watch case, which was dismissed after Automattic couldn't find the defendant, who lived in India. ""If you have any leads about what 'Nick Steiner' is up to — hit me up,"" quipped Hotham on Twitter. Automattic, though, says it's a signal that there are real legal consequences for taking advantage of the copyright enforcement system. ""It's important here that the court held that we could recover attorneys' fees and costs of suit, which were by far the biggest piece of damages,"" said general counsel Paul Sieminski in a statement. ""This case also sets the precedent that Automattic will stand up for our users, and fight back against DMCA abuse. Hopefully that, along with the rule that victims can collect damages (especially costly attorney's fees) may cause future DMCA abusers to think twice before they pull the same stunt.""

All of the films are under a minute long, five of them are under 30 seconds, two of them (Into the Woods and Noah) are 10-second still videos that exist solely to illustrate that there was not a single line spoken by a person of color in the entire movie. What is a speaking role and what is a meaningful role? What's even more grabbing, though, is the type of characters that the people of color in these movies are playing — ""New Secretary,"" ""Bus Driver,"" ""Letter Writer #2,"" ""Pizza Vendor,"" ""Uncomfortable Waitress,"" ""Airport Man,"" and ""Hostess,"" for example. Where people of color exist in these films, they exist primarily in service positions — massaging Natalie Portman's diaphragm, begging Justin Timberlake not to seat himself at a restaurant, making Zooey Deschanel's absence more clear by being brown-eyed and dark-skinned where she used to be all porcelain and manga eyes. In Black Swan and The Fault in Our Stars, women of color are called upon to comfort white protagonists with about 40 seconds of soft-spoken dialogue apiece.  Similar to the Bechdel Test, which is meant to gauge gender representation in movies, it's a method which works better at picking out an overarching trend than it does at punching holes in individual films. The Bechdel Test aimed to pluck out films that represent women fairly, but Bridesmaids passes only narrowly, Beasts of the Southern Wild doesn't pass at all, and Sharknado passes with flying colors, despite the fact that its female characters exist solely as well-tanned pieces of meat in cutoffs. But the test's existence was enough to motivate people to start thinking about how women were being represented on screen, and eventually, to think about how that factored into how off-screen women enjoyed film (and obviously, to think about how these things could translate into money).  Every Single World is a project every bit as imperfect as the Bechdel Test — the fact that Frances Ha has almost no dialogue spoken by people of color isn't so much an accident fueled by prejudice as it is purposeful discrimination that serves the point of the script. The film is about two entitled white women in their insular entitled white world, struggling to become better people in spite of it. But it does well at drawing attention to the still galling absence of non-white people in most of the world's most successful films — of the 100 top-grossing films from 2007 to 2012, one study found, about 11 percent of the speaking characters were black, while 5 percent were Hispanic, 4.2 percent were Asian, and 3.6 percent were other (or mixed race) ethnicities, despite the fact that non-whites make up about 44 percent of the people who go to the movies, and a much higher percentage of people who exist in the world. Looking at films on a case-by-case basis, like Marron does with this project, helps break this down further so that we can differentiate what is a speaking role and what is a meaningful role. Next let's talk about who's directing these movies, and why the internet was such a collective asshole about national treasure Michael B. Jordan playing Johnny Storm.

Dubbed Legendary VR, the initiative consists of an app — available right now for Android and iOS — and a version of the new Google Cardboard, with Legendary set to distribute 50,000 units of the DIY VR kits over the course of the week. The app currently houses three different experiences: Warcraft: The Skies of Azeroth, Beware Crimson Peak, and the company's Pacific Rim-themed Jaeger Pilot. In the first experience, players sit atop a massive Gryphon as it soars across Azeroth, revealing the landscape featured in the film. Beware Crimson Peak is a more frightening, atmospheric experience, putting the viewer inside the titular house from Guillermo del Toro's upcoming film. Jaeger Pilot is the same VR experience we tried last year, but rather than being tied to the Oculus Rift, it is now able to run on any smartphone that can run Legendary's app.   Director Duncan Jones ""I talk about it like it's a real place; for me it is."" Speaking to journalists at Legendary's Comic-Con booth, director Duncan Jones said that the experience was a collaboration between himself and the company's VR team. ""I was obviously focused mainly on the film, but we discussed what kind of experience we could give the audience through VR,"" Jones said. ""With this world building that we're doing in the movie, is there something we can do that can give you that sense of world building in VR? ...So we have this Gryphon flight over Stormwind. And anyone that does know Stormwind — I talk about it like it's a real place; for me it is — will be able to recognize things. And those who don't, it's just a cool, fantasy experience."" Calling virtual reality ""our gift to fans,"" Legendary VP of theatrical strategy Barnaby Legg said that the medium was a perfect way for the company to give audiences new ways into its big-budget properties, the same way it does with graphic novels or other tie-ins. ""VR is a very nascent medium, and I think all of us in the entertainment business are dipping our toe in and kind of seeing where it goes,"" he said. ""Our view at the moment is that we feel we're in the experience business, and as we learned last year VR is an amazing way of expanding the universe of our films and really immerse our audiences."" Of course, this is just the beginning of the Warcraft Comic-Con push. Jones is scheduled for Legendary's panel on Saturday, and while he wouldn't confirm what will be shown, with the movie coming out next June it would be the perfect time to show off a new teaser.

It might come as a shock considering the site’s reputation for virulent racism, but r/BlackPeopleTwitter, a channel that showcases the jokes and positivity black people share with one another, holds roughly half of the top 50 posts on Reddit from the past year. It even came as a surprise to the channel’s moderators, who claim that the subreddit’s popularity was mostly accidental. Still, it struck a chord; as one mod, Gerald, told The Verge, ""Race relations in the world unfortunately may never be ideal, but if there's one thing that can help bring all people together, it has been and will always be humor."" What should not surprise, however, is how Black Twitter, a collective of vocal and socially motivated black people online, still struggles for mainstream media attention. Not enough people know how powerful and meaningful it is for public discourse. But as the Los Angeles Times this week announced it would hire a reporter to cover Black Twitter specifically, that might finally start to change. Black culture is inherent to the makeup of America Black culture is inherent to the makeup of America. Voices in the black community have influenced American culture as a whole for generations, leaving indelible marks on politics and the arts. However, there is a wide gulf between influence and recognition. It’s the lived reality of white supremacy; blacks and people of color are deprived of the institutional power afforded to whites in this country. Thus, whatever innovation black people create is ignored, perceived as a curiosity, or appropriated long before it is accepted. Only time, concerted effort, and peril allows for the appreciation of the work of black hands and minds. The same is happening with Black Twitter. The last several years have brought violence and terror to the black community in America. Children have died, and churches have burned to the ground. It’s now clearer than ever that more should be done to better tell their stories. So, in the memo sent to LA Times staff, managing editor S. Mitra Kalita named Dexter Thomas, a media scholar and author, as the reporter who would take the Black Twitter beat: It’s still too early to tell how the stories told from this beat will read. However, Thomas’ task in reporting on Black Twitter will hopefully entail complicating narratives about race in America, on and offline, and elevating conversations about Black Twitter itself in media beyond just ""what black people are talking about today."" As an amorphous collective of black voices, Black Twitter was initially identified as those in the black community leading the most popular, entertaining trending topics and hashtags. Observing the back-and-forth created by such tags as #uainthittinitright, The Awl’s Choire Sicha once mused about his ""obsession with Late Night Black People Twitter, an obsession I know some of you other white people share, because it is awesome."" Black Twitter's greatest strength has long been its ability to mobilize Indeed, Black Twitter’s power to entertain and drive culture is pre-eminent. But even Reddit giving rise to powerful black voices doesn’t show the complete picture. Black Twitter’s greatest strength as a collective has long been its ability to mobilize, serving as a platform for raising awareness about the black experience, thanks to hashtags like #BlackLivesMatter — which exploded into public consciousness beyond Twitter amidst last year’s protests against police violence — and open discussion about how race intersects with class, gender, and sexuality. ""For every major news story, there is a story that Black Twitter is able to tell,"" Meredith Clark, an assistant professor of journalism at the University of North Texas, told The Verge. ""The day that the Supreme Court issued its ruling on same-sex marriage, people who identity as part of Black Twitter were there talking about struggles that continue for people of color. That it doesn’t just end at marriage equality."" That the struggle for identity and recognition is playing out online, across platforms, and at a large scale is incredible and mustn’t be ignored. Sadly, even media’s sloth at grokking this shift is yet another case of history repeating itself. At a time when newsroom diversity is still depressingly low, the fact remains that news organizations were called upon to hire more black reporters nearly 50 years ago by President Lyndon Johnson. ""As far back as the Kerner Commission report in 1967, we have known that news media has been deficient in its ability to fairly, accurately, and comprehensively cover the black experience in America,"" said Clark. The Commission’s report, released by the Johnson administration after the race riots of 1967, recommended that newsrooms hire, train, and retain black reporters to allow for the coverage black communities and America at large need lest we move ""toward two societies, one black, one white — separate and unequal."" Now, with police killing after police killing, riots in Baltimore, and the murder of black churchgoers serving as a dark mirror for Civil Rights-era violence, it is high time journalists got this task right. We must recognize and appreciate the work of black hands and minds It’s time to pay attention. Hiring a beat reporter is still just a first step, and there are questions left to be answered. No community is a monolith, so whose stories will be told? Can one reporter cover every aspect of a vibrant, thriving collective? How many organizations will follow suit? Still, we need more initiatives like this. As newsrooms endeavor to improve how they report both internally and in their storytelling, making a concerted effort toward including and understanding a community that already breaks news gives reason for cautious optimism. It means our collective culture can finally start to recognize and appreciate the work of black hands and minds.",0.8817077360523439,0.11829226394765613,0.8538698091558654,968,5.2179752066115705,517,6.483558994197292,0,0,"Culture, Entertainment, Report",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

There's an official version coming — one you can actually purchase soon. Created by USAopoly / Hasbro in conjunction with HBO, Risk: Game of Thrones Edition will be in stores this August. Given the show's utter preoccupation with warfare and world domination, it's a wonder it took them so long. The Wall Street Journal got an exclusive first look at the game, in which players will vie for control of the Seven Kingdoms and of the Iron Throne. (Quick, what's the GoT equivalent of holing up in Australia?) The game will mimic the show in scale and include more than 650 game pieces — 45 intricately carved pieces will make up each of the seven armies. Players will be able to compete as one of seven houses — Martell, Stark, Baratheon, Lannister, Tyrell, Targaryen, and Ghiscari.       But, in true George R.R. Martin fashion, there's a twist. This edition of Risk will include three different ways to play on two separate game boards. One variant is the War of Five Kings, in which 3–5 players can choose to play as houses Martell, Stark, Baratheon, Lannister, and Tyrell and battle for the Iron Throne in Westeros. Then there's the second version played on Essos, in which two players control House Targaryen and House Ghiscari, respectively, battling to take control of the slaves held by the latter. The last version brings all seven houses together in a no-holds-barred grudge match to the end. Because when you play the Game of Thrones, you win or you die. Each house also comes with a customized player board to help you track how you're doing — and just like in the show, the characters play an integral role. The game has character cards that can influence how battles are fought or territories conquered. There are other special features to the game, including Maester cards for using tactical skills and the wisdom of a Maester in battle, objective cards to complete conquests, and gold dragon coins to buy wealth and power.

Only this year, it held the launch event a couple of weeks early and relocated it to New York City. This geographic switch is at least partly down to the fact that the new Galaxy Note 5 will not be going on sale in Europe. Not today, not tomorrow, and maybe not at all. It would have been a bad look to come to the center of Europe to announce a product no store on the continent will stock. ""Samsung’s portfolio will be centred on the Galaxy S6 edge+."" But what's driven Samsung's decision to withdraw one of its halo devices from one of the most important electronics markets in the world? The company says it's a matter of ""consumer needs and the specific market situation."" To best serve European needs, Samsung is promoting the Galaxy S6 Edge+ ahead of the Note: a device that has the same basic hardware as the Note, but misses out on the stylus and related functionality. In short, Samsung is saying that European customers appreciate big screens just like everyone else, but probably don't make use of the stylus as much as their Asian or American counterparts. As someone who's used each of the four Note generations so far, and often forgotten the stylus even existed, I'm inclined to agree with that assessment. The situation could still change, depending on how much of an outcry the Note's European absence engenders (one retailer has started a petition to encourage Samsung to change its mind), but for now at least, Europeans are going to have to look elsewhere to satisfy any cravings for a stylus. Samsung's full statement on the matter is below. ""The market availability of the Samsung Galaxy Note 5 will vary according to consumer needs and the specific market situation. The Samsung Galaxy Note 5 will be introduced in the US and Asian markets in August and we will look at further opportunities to launch the Galaxy Note 5 in other markets.""

And there, Golem.de reports, Samsung has introduced the PM1633a. It's a terrible name for a wonderful thing: the world's largest hard drive, packed into a 2.5-inch case. It's listed as 16TB (technically, it's 15.36TB), and the best part about it is that it's a solid state drive using Samsung's new 256GB NAND flash as the basis for the storage. As Ars Technica reports, that new flash memory is the key to stuffing more storage capacity into the same space, and it works by stacking the transistors vertically. When we saw the news this morning, a debate ensued inside The Verge offices about whether or not it was accurate to call this thing a hard drive. ""Hard drive"" is usually shorthand for ""hard disk drive,"" and therefore has built into its name the idea of spinning magnetic platters. But this is an SSD, so if you want to be that person who pushes their glasses up and #actuallys about it, you could argue that it's not technically a hard drive. But really, we all just think of a hard drive as the component where you store stuff on a computer, and this PM1633a can store more stuff than anything else. Hence, the headline you see above. No pricing has been announced, but it'll be expensive, and it's safe to assume it'll be sold primarily to enterprise customers for use in servers. In fact, Samsung was touting a reference design for a server with 48 of these hard drives installed, which adds up to a total capacity of 768TB. Samsung called it ""JBOF,"" which stands for ""Just a Bunch Of Flash.""

After telling the press yesterday that it wasn't offering a 128GB version of the new Galaxy Note 5, Samsung today quietly added the larger memory option to its online store — as well as a 128GB version of the Galaxy S6 Edge+. The 128GB S6 Edge+ appeared to be only available in black on Sprint and T-Mobile, but in black or gold on AT&T and Verizon. After enquiring about these listings, The Verge was informed by Samsung that they were put up in error and will be retracted. That doesn't necessarily mean that Samsung won't offer the larger memory options in the future, as the company already sells 128GB variants of the Galaxy S6. There appears to be quite a bit of uncertainty around Samsung's plan for its pair of new phablets, with the company also indicating that it doesn't have plans to sell the Note 5 in Europe, at least not for this year.

But apparently we don't have to wait until then to actually see what the watch looks like: the Gear S2 is already being shown off by Samsung in a fashion shoot, of all things. Samsung has a weird history with fashion wherein it continually partners with high fashion companies to make tacky accessories and the public continually facepalms; this time, it's just partnered with fashion figures to put together a photo shoot showcasing the new phones it announced today, the Galaxy Note 5 and the S6 Edge+, as well as its upcoming smartwatch. At least from a tech perspective, the Gear S2 smartwatch is the obvious star of the show here. It appears in two photos, both of which make it look pretty stylish and maybe not totally huge. The rest of the photos are worth checking out too — they're apparently a mashup of ""the fashion industry’s seasonal collection"" and Samsung's new phones. I can't speak to the accuracy of Samsung's presentation of the current fashion season (honestly, I'm not even sure if we're looking at Fall 2015 or Spring 2016 here), but I would definitely question some of its choices here. I asked several of my colleagues over at Racked for some thoughts on the shoot, which they described more as being super thirsty than outright terrible. ""It looks honestly like a series of tears from fashion editorials of the last three decades with big rectangles ('phones') placed in,"" says Nicola Fumo, Racked's shopping and style editor. Samsung brought in established fashion names to make this, she says, and in doing so likely spent a ton of money. ""Clearly they're trying to art different attitudes/needs of women, those foreign creatures,"" Fumo says.

The investment, one that’s part of President Obama’s 2016 budget proposal, will also go toward pioneering new models for patient-specific medical research — research that caters to a specific patient’s needs based on their genetics instead of relying on a one-size-fits-all treatment approach. ""Most medical treatments have been designed for the ‘average patient,’"" according to a White House statement. As a result, treatments can be very successful for some patients, but not for others. And that’s exactly what the White House’s plan aims to change. ""The Precision Medicine Initiative will leverage advances in genomics, emerging methods for managing and analyzing large data sets while protecting privacy, and health information technology to accelerate biomedical discoveries.""  ""health information technology to accelerate biomedical discoveries."" The White House’s investment is split in four parts. The biggest chunk of the money, about $130 million, will go to the NIH to recruit a ""million or more volunteers"" whose genetic information will be stored in a series of databases. About $70 million will go to the National Cancer Institute, a subsection of the NIH, so it can increase its efforts to identify genetic mutations that contribute to a person's cancer risk. The FDA, for its part, will receive $10 million to improve its databases, as well as the technologies used to analyze DNA. Finally, the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology will receive $5 million that will be used to address privacy issues and ensure that data exchanges between research centers are secure. Some of the genetic data that will be included in this initiate has already been gathered, according to Jo Handelsman, associate director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. He told The New York Times that ""there are existing cohorts around the country that have already been started and have rich sources of data. The challenge in this initiative is to link them together and fill in the gaps."" New volunteers will also be recruited, he said,  and their ""privacy will be rigorously protected."" ""privacy will be rigorously protected."" Despite these safeguards, recruiting participants might be a challenge. A recent survey conducted by researchers at Brigham and Women’s Hospital showed that Americans worry that insurance companies and employers may discriminate against them based on their family histories or genetic test results. The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act was signed into law in 2008 to prevent genetic discrimination from happening, but these protections only cover instances of discrimination by an employer or a health insurance company. Companies that sell life insurance, long-term care insurance, and disability insurance can still ask for genetic tests results if they wish — and they can base their rates on this information. $215 million is a very large amount to spend on an initiative of this kind, says Michael Eisen, a geneticist at the University of California, Berkeley. ""I worry that this $200 million will ultimately come from basic research funding, and will thus be another step in the decade long shift from basic to applied research,"" he says. If that's the case, then precision medicine ""will be useless,"" as basic medicine is where all the ideas for how to use that information is produced. Eisen also told The Verge that the money will be ""flushed down the toilet"" if the databases developed through this initiate are poorly constructed. ""I  am very leery of big, centrally organized science endeavors, as they do not have a good recent track record.""

A gigantic rocket that can land itself. Elon Musk's SpaceX released a new video this week demonstrating just what it plans to do with its upcoming Falcon Heavy rocket, which is set to launch for the first time later this year. In essence, the rocket is three of the company's current Falcon 9 rockets strapped together. The result is a rocket that can carry over 115,000 pounds (53,000 kg) — the equivalent of a fully-loaded Boeing 737 passenger jet — to low-earth orbit. When it flies later this year, the Falcon Heavy will be the world's most powerful operational rocket. Only the Saturn V rocket, which was retired in 1973 after sending Apollo missions to the moon, was more powerful. Powerful enough to carry a fully-loaded 737 jet But what's even more impressive is that SpaceX wants the Falcon Heavy to land itself. The company has been testing the concept for the past couple of years with its Grasshopper rockets, and more recently, the Falcon 9-R, which exploded spectacularly earlier this month during one such test. Landing the first stage rockets of the Falcon Heavy will require not just one landing, but three — one for each rocket booster. By saving the first-stage rockets, SpaceX hopes to cut costs and promote accelerated launch schedules. While the computer-illustrated video may seem like little more than science fiction at this point, SpaceX has demonstrated that it's close to landing rockets after launching their payloads. Despite the explosion during testing this month, the Falcon 9-R did navigate its way back from the upper reaches of the atmosphere to a tiny, 300-by-100-foot barge off the coast of Florida. According to Elon Musk, had it not run out of hydraulic fluid right before landing, the rocket may have survived the trip.

A study published in the journal Stroke this week says that consuming more than two alcoholic drinks a day on average increases the stroke risk for individuals in their 50s and 60s more than traditional factors like high blood pressure and diabetes. The study examined more than 11,000 twins from the Swedish Twin Registry, sorting them into the categories of non-drinkers, light drinkers, moderate drinkers or heavy drinkers based on a questionnaire issued in 1967. Non-drinkers were excluded from the study as they might have been alcoholics who later gave up. Light drinkers were classified as those that had less than half a drink a day on average while heavy drinkers had more than two drinks a day. Moderate drinkers fell in between these two poles. Heavy drinkers were 34 percent more likely to suffer a stroke than light drinkers The researchers reported that after controlling for factors including diabetes, high blood pressure, smoking, exercise, and weight, individuals that were heavy drinkers in their middle age were 34 percent more likely to suffer a stroke than their light-drinking peers. However, for individuals between the ages of 75 and 80, blood pressure was the greatest factor, and for those older than 80, diabetes mattered most. ""The main message is that for people in middle age it's harmful to drink more than two drinks of alcohol a day,"" says Pavla Kadlecová, a statistician who worked on the study. Kadlecová notes that as the study looked at twins it also controlled for genetic and lifestyle factors, although it did not take into account how twins' lifestyles might diverge after a young age. The study might underestimate the risk posed by alcohol ""They're making the important point that in relative terms alcohol is a more important risk factor for people in middle age than high blood pressure or diabetes,"" says Jonathan Mant, a professor at the University of Cambridge's Primary Care Unit and an expert in stroke prevention. ""And in relative terms it seems to match smoking very closely."" However, as the measure of alcohol consumption in the study only came from a single questionnaire, the researchers might have even underestimated the risk says Mant.

From January 1 to 28, 84 people in 14 states have been reported as having measles,  said Anne Schuchat, the head of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. Most of these cases — 56 people — are linked to the outbreak at Disneyland resort in Anaheim, where five employees are sick as well. The remainder were infected abroad and brought the disease back. last year, the cdc reported 644 measles cases Measles was declared eliminated in the US in 2000, but they've been creeping back. From 2000 to 2010, there were usually about 60 cases a year. Last year, the CDC reported 644 cases — the highest number of measles infections since 2000. More adults are getting sick than in typical outbreaks, Schuchat said. The majority of people who got sick were unvaccinated. ""This is not a problem of the measles vaccine not working. This is a  problem of the measles vaccine not being used,"" said Schuchat, the head of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, in the call. ""It is frustrating that people have opted out of vaccination."" Some parents have avoided vaccinating their children after a now-discredited study by Andrew Wakefield suggested a link between vaccination and autism. The British Medical Journal has called Wakefield a ""fraud,"" and the studies where he claimed to have found the link were retracted by the journal that published them, The Lancet. In multiple studies since Wakefield's original report, no link has been found between vaccines and autism. ""This is a problem of the measles vaccine not being used.""That message hasn't made it to some people, though. Celebrities like Jenny McCarthy spread conspiracy theories — nicely detailed in Seth Mnookin's book, The Panic Virus — about ""toxins"" in vaccines that could cause autism in children. Our best evidence suggests that this is not what's happening. But parents don't seem to want to listen. Communities, especially in California, are springing up where significant parts of the population are unvaccinated. And now, The New York Times is publicly wondering if measles are going to spell trouble for the Super Bowl (over 1,000 people in Arizona have been exposed; health authorities are engaged in contact tracing now). Anna Edney, of Bloomberg News, asked the CDC if they were worried about such a large crowd gathering, on the press call. Because — in case it's not obvious by now —measles is highly contagious. A person with measles doesn't show symptoms for four days before the rash appears, but is capable of infecting others. The virus is airborne, and can live for up to two hours on surfaces after being ejected from the body, according to the CDC. ""Measles is so contagious that if one person has it, 90 percent of the people  close to that person who are not immune will also become infected,"" the CDC writes. Measles is highly contagious Measles is a miserable disease. Its characteristics are a high fever, a runny nose, a rash, and conjunctivitis. Children under the age of five and adults over 20 are most likely to suffer serious complications, which include: pneumonia (the most common cause of death in children with measles), brain swelling, and (of course) death. But even the mild cases are brutal. But we've beaten measles before. The effort for public vaccination began in 1963, when three million to four million in the US were infected yearly by the virus; the yearly death toll was around 500. The vaccination campaign in the 1960s was so successful that we've forgotten what a powerful enemy measles can be. ""We have a generation that hasn’t seen this disease,"" said Schuchat. ""Clinicians who haven’t taken care of it, parents who wonder if this disease exists."" It definitely exists. And even vaccinated people can be sickened by measles, although the phenomenon is rare. Our vaccination rate among children varies by state: 82 percent in Colorado is the low end; the high end is Mississippi, where virtually everyone got their shots. Public health officials say vaccination rates need to be higher than 95 percent to avoid outbreaks — otherwise, because measles is so good at spreading, it can find and exploit gaps in immunity. vaccination rates need to be higher than 95 percent That's what's really frustrating about vaccine denialists. If you want to run the risk of having your child suffer (and possibly die!) from a preventable disease for no good reason, hey — you're more of a gambler than I am, and the best of luck to you. But there are some people that are put at risk when the number of vaccinated people drops. People whose immune systems aren't as strong —  so you know, pregnant women, newborns, cancer patients, HIV-positive people, transplant recipients, the elderly  — are also affected by the choice not to vaccinate. Parents who choose not to vaccinate their kids aren't just gambling with their kids' lives, they're gambling with the lives of others, too. Again: with no evidence. There is no reason why we should have measles outbreaks. Put on your grown-up outfit, suck it up for the good of society, and vaccinate your fucking kids.

They forge most of the basic elements we know, including the ones that make up our bodies. But we still don't know exactly how they happen. It's getting a little clearer though, and a new study published today in Science could address part of the mystery.   Researchers looked at supernova remnant Cassiopeia A in a unique way — one that allowed them to map its interior in three dimensions. The story told by that map reveals large-scale structures in the interior of the remnant, a previously undiscovered trait that suggests stars might explode differently than astronomers had imagined, says study author Dan Milisavljevic, a postdoctoral fellow with the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory. These explosions are the most catastrophic events that occur in nature, and they happen all the time. We detect one every second in our sky; some are so large they can be seen with the naked eye, like the one Johannes Kepler observed in 1604. They’ve also been extensively researched. But a lot of the research focuses on extragalactic explosions — ones hundreds of millions of light-years away, Milisavljevic says. That’s too great a distance to inspect the fine details, details scientists need to understand what’s going on in the interior of the remnants. ""If you had a light bulb that’s really distant, you wouldn’t know what it's made of. If it’s nearby, you could see the filaments,"" he says. Cassiopeia A is much closer and relatively young. It’s just 11,000 light-years from us, and the explosion was first sighted over 300 years ago. With Cassiopeia A, all the debris from the explosion is laid out in plain sight. ""The bomb’s gone off,"" Milisavljevic says. ""So did it explode equally in all directions, or was it preferential?"" Previously, scientists thought that supernova explosions were inherently random. Astronomers had painted a picture of dying stars as spherically symmetrical objects that, as they burn up their remaining fuel, collapse inward before exploding outward symmetrically — a notion Milisavljevic calls ""cartoonish."" Even if the stars were spherical and symmetrical, their heaviest elements would remain close to the center due to the laws of physics. Milisavljevic and co-author Robert Fesen have found evidence that both of these ideas are false. The structure in this ejecta material that suggests that the explosion wasn’t random and that some asymmetry in the star or its explosion led to the formation of these structures. This could give astronomers reason to believe that stars behave differently than imagined before their massive explosions. You can inspect the new Cassiopeia A data yourself in this webapp made by the research team. First, they identified structures six light-years wide in the remnant. As they looked more closely, the researchers noticed the formations were surrounded by ""bubbles"" of empty space. In fact, these bubbles may be what caused the structures. Milisavljevic and Fresen claim they were created by nickel-56, a heavy radioactive material that escaped further outward from the explosion than anyone had previously imagined. As the nickel moved away from the explosion, it decayed. The radioactive decay created pressure, pushing the lighter materials around it away, creating a cavity surrounded by these structures. Milisavljevic and Fesen believe they’ve found six of these large-scale formations. This graphic shows the layers of an evolved star, from iron (Fe) at the core to its outer shell of hydrogen (H). The two are still looking for more proof to back up these initial findings. If these bubbles were created by nickel, there’s evidence that scientists could examine — the presence of iron, Milisavljevic says. That’s because when radioactive nickel decays, it forms cobalt and eventually iron. Right now they can see iron deposits in about half of the bubbles, but the evidence is still missing from the rest. ""Very smart people have looked, and they haven’t seen it. But we say that we haven’t looked hard enough,"" Milisavljevic says. He argues modern observatories just aren’t sensitive enough to pick up the signal of the remaining iron — a problem that could have a remedy in the next few years when the James Webb Space Telescope launches. The Webb Telescope will scan the universe from space almost a million miles away from Earth, so it will deal with less interference and be able to see in higher resolution. From there, astronomers and supernova modelers can use this new data as they try to learn what might cause this asymmetry in the moments before a supernova explosion. There are already a few possibilities, according to Milisavljevic. One is that the stars’ shape might get disrupted by the magnetic fields created by their spin. Another is that the increased density of a star about to go supernova could trap neutrinos, and those neutrinos would produce enough of an energy variation in different regions of the star to disrupt the symmetry. A third option is that the explosive force could expand symmetrically, but the material of the star around it could be sloshing as the star destabilizes. There is evidence that points to this, according to Milisavljevic. A star underwent an eruption in 2009 that was initially thought to be a supernova. Closer inspection showed there wasn’t enough energy released to classify it as such, and the star basically burped these smaller explosions until one final massive eruption occurred in 2012. ""That must be associated with some kind of turbulence inside that mixed the interior,"" Milisavljevic says. ""My hope is that, with our result, perhaps the modelers can try and determine which of these mechanisms is most consistent with the structure we see in Cas A,"" Milisavljevic says.  Each slit on this chart represents one of the positions observed by the team in their survey of Cassiopeia A. The three-dimensional map of Cassiopeia A wasn’t what Milisavljevic and Fesen originally set out to do when they arrived at Kitt Peak National Observatory a year ago. That night, with smooth jazz playing in observatory (""That’s Rob,"" Milisavljevic jokes), the duo used their reserved telescope time to study the outermost regions of Cassiopeia A. Good weather made for quick observations, and they found themselves with leftover time. Asymmetrical explosion had already been discussed, so they used the Mayall 4-meter telescope spectrograph to peer into Cassiopeia A’s interior. ""It didn’t take very long, actually, I think that exposure was 20 minutes,"" says Milisavljevic. ""That was enough to convince us that we needed to come back and do it again, and tear it apart, do as much of the remnant as we could."" With evidence in hand, they applied for more time to map the interior of Cassiopeia A over the the course of the following year. ""We’re quite bewildered about how the explosion proceeds,"" Milisavljevic says. ""You look at the debris field of an exploded star and we can see how the insides were shaped by the explosion process — we’re finally getting a real understanding of how stars explode.""",0.6340925253161188,0.3659074746838812,0.18575038757459753,1173,5.1543052003410059,580,6.2568965517241377,0,12,"Science, Report",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

With 12 NFL seasons under his belt, the 34-year-old is quite literally an old pro now. But retiring from the NFL, or any high performance sport, isn’t easy. A lot of obstacles can come up as players transition into ""normal life"" — a life they’ve technically never had. NFL players take huge risks simply by playing. Because of the hits they suffer, retirees who start playing tackle football before the age of 12 have a higher risk of developing memory and thinking problems later in life, according to a study of 42 NFL players published yesterday in Neurology. NFL players also show signs of arthritis far earlier than the average male. These issues tend to pop up later in life, however — long after they’ve moved on from the NFL. In the meantime, they’ve had to adapt to living like a ""regular person,"" and that transition doesn’t always happen smoothly. After all, building a whole new identify for yourself can get really weird, really fast. ""The only times I got the ‘energy’ that I wanted to play — to be involved or be on the field — was during a big Monday night game versus a rivalry, or a big playoff game,"" says Earnest Byner, a former NFL player and coach who caught a touchdown pass for Washington in the 1992 Super Bowl championship game. When Byner stopped playing football in 1997, he was relieved. But after a few months, he started to miss it. Seeing players doing what he once did so well made him feel ""nervous,"" he says. But that feeling quickly dissipated;  coaching was enough. He thinks he’s different from a lot of other players, however, and he considers himself lucky. ""I guess I’m blessed to be able to have the mentality that I have,"" Byner says, ""being able to adjust and move on to the next life."" ""There are a few things to keep in mind with high performance athletes,"" says Matt Johnson, a sports psychologist who has worked with college football players and NFL athletes. The first is whether or not leaving the sport was the player’s own decision. Did they get cut from the team? Did an injury get in the way? Did they make it to the Super Bowl? If they achieved their goals and then left, that can make the transition a lot easier, Johnson says. When a player gets cut because of an injury, or simply because they’re aren’t playing the way they once did, that can have big implications for a player’s mental health. ""I work with several professional athletes who retired after an injury,"" says Anne Smith, a psychologist and a former Wimbledon tennis champion, ""and what I hear mostly from them is that it's hard to be at home all the time."" ""If they are leaving by force, then a sense of control is being taken away from them,"" Johnson says. And losing control often leads to frustration, anger, and depression. But even the decision to leave isn’t as important to an athlete’s transition as the strength of their ""player Identity,"" says Nicole Detling, a sports psychologist at the University of Utah who worked with Olympic athletes. ""'Who am I once that I am no longer a football player?’ is hard question to answer for many players."" If all they’ve ever experienced is the athlete’s identity, leaving that life behind can be unsettling, says Mustafa Sarkar, a sports psychologist at the University of Gloucestershire in the UK who has studied perseverance in Olympic athletes. ""So my recommendation from a psychology perspective is for them to have multiple identities, not purely about their sport."" ""Once they have an identity away from the field — whether it’s ‘I’m a dad,’ ‘I’m a businessperson,’ or ‘I’m a husband’ — that’s when they can start to understand that they still value away from the field,"" Detling says. But even then, it’s hard to find fulfillment somewhere else, Smith says. ""When athletes are playing in front of hundred of thousands of people… You can’t replace that feeling — it's difficult.""   Philip Robertston, Flickr Depression and anxiety isn’t just a problem for NFL players, of course; anxiety disorders can arise in all professional sports. Combine that with the fact that intensive exercise is very addictive, and you end up with a population that’s likely to experience any number of mental health issues once they leave sports. And when these issues arise, some retired athletes seek out substances that can replace the ""high"" they used to get from physical activity. ""A lot of retired athletes report fairly significant mental health concerns and an increased level of substance dependence,"" Frances Quirk, co-editor-in-chief of the journal Performance Enhancement & Health, told Bloomberg in 2012. Even the most well-rounded retired athletes — those who already know who they are outside of sports — can feel isolated. ""A lot of NFL teams really emphasize the idea of the team as the family, and that’s not something you will do in a cubicle,"" Detling says. So if a player moves to the corporate world, they might start to wonder about who will have their back. Building a support system outside of football can make a huge difference, Sarkar says, but athletes ""really struggle to come to terms with losing that kind of friendship or bond with teammates."" Many players also have to deal with chronic pain. ""If you look at a lot of the research, NFL player’s bodies are so broken down after the sport,"" that many need to take pain medication and undergo surgery, Detling says. So even those who want to remain active don’t always have the luxury of doing so. Money can also be a huge source of concern. The average NFL player makes $1.9 million a year, but players don’t always have a plan for what to do with the amounts they’ve amassed after the NFL. Those who aren’t financially savvy, or those who aren’t sure what to do with their lives after football, can run into trouble, which adds to their stress. Some problems are less obvious, however. ""The thing that has been the challenge is trying to eat right,"" Byner says. ""I kept eating and I would go back and forth. My weight would fluctuate."" This problem is pretty typical, Detling says. Many players are so used to consuming large amounts of calories on a daily basis that they have trouble figuring out what’s a reasonable amount as they become less active. ""They can get really unhealthy and blow up"" because they’re still eating the way they did when they were working out all day, or because they’re stress eating, she says. When that happens, players are on their own; they have to learn how to live without coaches who are constantly telling them what to do and eat. ""I had to become more disciplined [with food],"" Byner says. ""It’s a challenge even though I was working out."" Every player is different, however, so it’s anybody guess as to how Williams will fare after his retirement — whenever that may be. ""Some players go through the transition really well,"" Detling says. It just depends on how well they’ve prepared. Educating athletes and managing their expectations around that is crucial, Sarkar says. Some will still find retirement difficult, but understanding what they might go through and why can go a long way. ""So when they do come across those situations,"" Sarkar says, ""it’s not so impactful as if they didn’t know anything at all about the potential negative effects of retiring from their sport.""

The company released millions of movie ratings from its users, offering a cash prize to anyone who could use them to build a better recommendation engine. But when researchers cross-referenced the now-public scores with iMDB reviews, they discovered they could effectively unmask the people behind them, even if customer names had been replaced by numbers. Netflix ended up in court with a woman who feared its contest would reveal her sexual orientation — that the films she was comfortable enough to talk about in public could inadvertently expose the ones she never meant to go beyond her queue. Today, researchers from MIT have published yet another reminder that no matter how many personal details are stripped away, our digital footprints can be uncomfortably revealing. If what we watch is a touchy subject, what we buy is even more intimate and revealing. Programs like Facebook Beacon, designed to advertise users' recent purchases to their friends, have been widely reviled. But the study, published today in Science, isn't about personal sharing. It's based on testing what the researchers call unicity: the odds that if you know fragments of a person's shopping history, you can match them against a much larger amount of data, uncovering everything else they've bought. As it turns out, those odds are very high. Unlike Netflix, banks aren't likely to be releasing millions of records to the public. And we already reveal our purchases in countless other ways — to social networks, department stores, and advertisers that can piece the threads together in eerily accurate ways. But as we record and quantify more of our lives, it's worth thinking about who might be watching, and what they could find. The NSA has reportedly mined credit card details the same way it's swept up emails and phone metadata; it already tracks suspects by matching calls against its vast trove of anonymous records. And taking previous, similar studies into account, the researchers speculate that most kinds of large-scale databases will be similarly revealing. ""The research here is really on the limits of anonymization [on] big, high-dimensional data — mobile phone data, credit cards, browsing, and so forth,"" says lead author Yves-Alexandre de Montjoye. ""How does your behavior compare with the behavior of others, and potentially make us unique?"" Three purchases can give you a match 94 percent of the time The authors started with three months of credit card transactions from 1.1 million people, provided by an unnamed bank in an unnamed OECD country (the lead author, Yves-Alexandre de Montjoye of MIT, wouldn't get more specific). They randomly pulled out a few single purchases for each person, then put the entire set in an anonymized database, removing details like names or bank account numbers. The database only gave prices within a range, since knowing that someone spent exactly $3.21 at Starbucks could give them away almost immediately. And researchers dropped super-high payments — more than $22,000 — for the same reason. But this proved a minor stumbling block. When the authors mapped locations, dates, and prices of someone's non-anonymous purchases against the whole database, it was usually easy to find a single, unique pattern. With three points or more, it was virtually a certainty. ""You bought a coffee at that coffee shop, and you bought jeans at that shop, and then you bought a pizza,"" says de Montjoye, by way of example. There's a 94 percent chance that you're the only person who did so. Taking away price altogether made these matches harder to find. But with four purchases, it was back up to 90 percent. De Montjoye admits that other countries or regions could see slightly different results; logically, the more people use credit cards in a given area, the more difficult finding a match will become. Unicity already varies by income and gender — women are more identifiable than men, and richer people more identifiable than poorer ones. These are the kind of differences that are likely to draw both speculation and stereotyping, but the authors say that figuring out the real factors behind them is beyond this study's scope. Even the fuzziest data creates unique patterns Overall, though, it's not surprising that this kind of extrapolation is possible. De Montjoye authored a similar paper in 2012, using cellphone location tracking instead of purchases. If you knew where someone had been at four points in time, there was a 95 percent chance of finding the rest of their movements in a 1.5 million-person database. What's more interesting, perhaps, is that de Montjoye believes it's almost impossible to make this kind of information truly anonymous. The researchers also looked at the same records at a much coarser level, trying to create points so vague they couldn't be matched. To some extent, they succeeded. At the far end of the scale, they made anonymous purchases only accurate to within 15 days and a geographical range of 350 shops, widening the price ranges. With these changes, there's less than a 15 percent chance that knowing four things someone has bought will help you find them. It takes 10 known points to get an 80 percent chance. But that's still not a guarantee of privacy. For researchers and companies who want to work with ""big data,"" at least, de Montjoye hopes that owners can find a way to minimize what they give away. He suggests granting access to more abstract code instead of the raw information, comparing the system to Pandora's Music Genome Project — which captures ""distinct musical characteristics"" to show a profile of someone's tastes without actually revealing their playlists. And on a larger level, he wants to show people how much even vague details can reveal about a person. ""We need to rethink what it means for anonymization,"" says de Montjoye. ""And maybe at least be aware of what the risks are.""",0.5743743152956762,0.4256256847043238,0.19006962742633624,997,5.0712136409227684,554,6.0884476534296033,0,0,Science,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Google's ad, embedded above, was released online last month in support of Pride Month. It tells the story of a transgender man named Jake, who begins working out at a Kansas City gym to transform his body. The narrative then shifts to the gym itself, and how Google's small business services help raise its profile. With a run-time of more than two minutes, it is one of the longest commercials to ever air on ABC, according to the company.

What the company ended up with was 3.2 seconds from 0 to 60, something that really doesn't look like much on paper, but feels like being in a rocket ship when you're actually inside a vehicle, and ultimately behind the wheel.  I got pretty close to that, sitting shotgun in a top-of-the line P85D, the performance version of the Model S. It includes two motors so that the car can shift power to the right one in inclement weather. But it also means that flat out, it can push more power everywhere, getting the whole car from 0 to 60 in those precious seconds.  Where did we test that? On a course I think you can safely call the lap of terror. The first half involves accelerating through a tent that's been rigged with multicolor neon lights, resembling something like Rainbow Road from Mario Kart, albeit with a more real sense of death if something went wrong. The second half of the course demos some of the car's new ""autopilot"" features. This isn't full control of the car. It's little things like letting you change lanes just by flicking your turn signal (while the car looks out for anything that may be around you), as well as identifying signs and people. Nobody jumped out at us, but the car automatically changed its speed when we hit a slower zone.  Eventually Tesla is hoping to tune its autopilot system into something that will let people just kick back and be a passenger in their own car. But if the trip through the neon tunnel of terror is any indication, it's more fun to gun it. Here are some more shots of the new cars, the track, and the event. The new ""D"" variants of the Model S don't really look different on the outside. But they're very different on the inside. One of the only way to spot the difference from the outside is the red ""D"" added to the end of the model number. Here is the P85D, the highest-end Tesla Model S with all-wheel-drive and a performance package that gets it from 0 to 60 in 3.2 seconds. Tesla's D unveiling wasn't just for press. Many attendees drove to the Hawthorne Airport in Los Angeles in Teslas that filled the nearby lots. Tesla CEO Elon Musk points out the new features of the D system on stage with the new chassis being held up with a massive robotic car arm. Here's that arm manipulating the entire chassis like it's nothing. Inside our test drive (as a passenger). We're in the section of the road where the car is staying between the lines and changing speeds without human intervention as part of the new ""autopilot"" system. You also get the fancy ""D"" badge on your digital dashboard too. This area doubles as a heads up display for identifying objects when you're driving it with the help of the new ""autopilot"" features. This is how ""autopilot"" sees other vehicles and your car lane while driving. And of course you're listening to Daft Punk while all this is happening. One of the few things that lets you tell this apart from existing models. The back motor, with a nearly identical version sitting up in the front of the car.

I was extremely curious to see how it compared to the race fans I know and the earthbound competitors I've watched for years. And while many people immediately thought of Red Bull's comedic Flugtag when I told them where I was going, what I experienced couldn't have been more different. What I found was an impressive community of highly-skilled pilots, expert crew members, and the families that travel with them. The fans in the stands (Red Bull says that over 30,000 tickets were sold, with more being sold at the gate on race day) were similar to those that fill the speedway when NASCAR is in town — motorsports enthusiasts with a penchant for thrill-seeking — but the crowd was also unusually diverse. People sported everything from tank tops emblazoned with the word ""SELFIE"" to shirts from Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, and their ethnicities reflected the global makeup of the pilots who compete. All of this makes up a sport that's looking to grow, and flying through American speedways is certainly an interesting way to do it.  The Red Bull Air Race is pretty simple. Twelve pilots each get two timed runs on a course constructed out of inflatable pylons. They must pass each pylon at a specific height (designated in red) and at a certain orientation or else they are issued penalties that add time to their runs. Aside from the vertical turns at either end of the course, the planes were often only 50-100 feet off the ground at any moment during a lap. The pylons stand 82 feet tall, and are inflated by a 15-horsepower engine. The top section, in red, is made from an extremely thin material that tears away when a wing makes contact. When a pylon deflates, it can be re-inflated in as little as 90 seconds. In Las Vegas, the Air Race course was laid out between turns two and three of the speedway, and spanned the length of the back straightaway. Most pilots reached around 200 feet of altitude during their vertical turns, which made them visible miles away from the speedway. The most popular pilot all weekend was the United States' Kirby Chambliss, who won the championship in 2006. This amount of fan interaction was previously hard to come by at the series' more scenic venues since pilots would take off and land from off-site airfields.  Despite their unique looks, there are only four different types of aircraft in the field. The most popular is the Edge 540 V3, which is flown by five different pilots. The smoke from the planes is generated by injecting paraffin wax into the exhaust gases, and makes it easier to see the flight path of each plane. The pilots are in charge of activating it each run, and can be penalized one second on their lap time for ""insufficient smoke"" if they fail to activate it or run out during a lap.  ""Smoke on!"" is the command given to the pilots as they enter the race course, and serves as the sport's equivalent to auto racing's ""Start your engines!"" Some pilots like Kirby Chambliss use Red Bull cans to map out the course on their hangar floors. Australian pilot Matt Hall's plane clipped the water at the Windsor, Ontario Air Race in 2010. He was able to fly the plane to safety, but the incident contributed to the decision to suspend the series for three years. He used the time away to start a business in Australia. Even though they're dealing with expensive, high-tech aircraft, the race teams aren't against using DIY solutions like this to keep little accidents from turning into major problems in the air. Red Bull filled most of the downtime between classes with dozens of different side-shows, like freestyle motocross. The most stunning side act was Chuck Aaron's aerobatic helicopter show. It featured inverted maneuvers that looked impossible to pull off in a helicopter; Aaron is the only man in North America that performs them. One of the elder statesmen of the twelve-pilot field, 58-year-old Hungarian Peter Besenyei helped create the series in 2003. Speaking to the series' potential, Besenyei believes that it can become the next great worldwide motorsport. ""It's more spectacular and more thrilling than F1,"" he said. Besenyei's plane, the Corvus Racer, is the newest plane in the field and is technically faster and more agile than the others. The Air Race planes made good use of the existing runway in the infield of Las Vegas Motor Speedway. It was where they took off for and landed from each run. Another stunt that passed the time between rounds was Red Bull's team of wingsuited skydivers, who hopped out of a helicopter and landed on the grass in the front stretch of the speedway. The winner of the Las Vegas Air Race (and the youngest competitor in the field at 30 years old), Canada's Pete McLeod takes off from the infield before a qualifying run. Like other pilots, he praised the shift towards speedway racing. ""You just feel like getting in something with an engine and competing here. It just oozes that kind of motorsports feel.""  During the series' suspension, McLeod kept busy by flying other disciplines. ""I didn't fully disengage. I kept flying, doing professional aerobatics and air shows."" To him, taking time off wasn't an option. ""For me it was like: what else would I do?"" Outside the speedway Red Bull offered a ""90 seconds of the race experience"" which let fans take a virtual lap of the Air Race course in Ascot, which takes place over the United Kingdom's famed horse racing track.",0.6458217436330702,0.3541782563669298,0.8348390806546689,962,4.743243243243243,522,5.9597701149425291,0,40,"Transportation, Photo Essay",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

""It’s actually in production. In fact, every car coming off the line at Tesla at the factory has the autopilot hardware."" Musk has an outsized personality with a reputation for flair and hyperbole, and for the most part, he earns it: both Tesla and SpaceX have undertaken and delivered on profoundly large challenges that entire industries (and governments) have failed to overcome. And his preferred term of ""autopilot"" for the bundle of hardware and software installed on new Teslas isn’t inaccurate — the car can take control on highways, park itself in your garage at home, and intervene when it thinks you might be on a collision course. But for as many things as Tesla’s autopilot mode does, the one thing it doesn’t do is change the game. The stereotypical vision of a car of the future tooling around your neighborhood with a driver comfortably asleep at the wheel (or missing altogether) isn’t any closer to reality than it was before.  Only incrementally more advanced than what's already on the road While it’s true that Musk introduced the most advanced commercial autonomous driving system yet, it’s only incrementally the most advanced when compared to what’s already on the road. The sensor package that all Model S vehicle rolling off the assembly line now have installed bears much resemblance to what various automakers have been offering for years: radar, forward-facing cameras, and ultrasonic sensors are new to Tesla, but they aren’t new to the industry at large. For instance, the Lexus HS250h that I used to drive, manufactured in 2010, could effectively drive itself on highways using its lane-keep assist and dynamic cruise control — between those two features, the car had full control over steering, acceleration, and braking. Like Tesla, it used a combination of radar and cameras. Of course, sensors, software, and the legal landscape have all matured since then. There’s little question that Tesla’s system is the most advanced and the most integrated to get a production commitment, but others like Mercedes-Benz’s Steer Assist — which is available on the 2014 S Class — come awfully close. Some BMWs can already read speed limit signs, as the Model S can now do. And while there isn’t another car on the market that will park itself and pick you up unattended, Audi has demonstrated it. Meanwhile, a startup is preparing to ship automated driving as an add-on for Audis that are already on the road. Automakers from Volkswagen to Volvo are converging on approximately the same place: hands-off driving in easy, relatively predictable conditions — highways, mainly — in the next couple years, with full autonomy likely to come a few years after that. (NHTSA refers to these systems as Level 3 and Level 4, respectively.) Tesla’s in roughly the same place, it’s just pushing a little harder by promising a 2015 launch and a campaign of rolling software updates to make the system more advanced over time. And, of course, Tesla has the X-factor, Elon Musk. The technology can’t really move any faster than that. Just ask Google, which has logged hundreds of thousands of miles testing self-driving systems over the past several years but hasn’t solved snow and heavy rain in its new car (and it’s equipped with a wider variety of sensors than Tesla is using). The challenges to making a car that can safely transport you from door to door — no matter where those doors are and what the prevailing conditions may be — still loom large. There will be many stepping stones along the way But there will be many stepping stones along the way, each system a little more autonomous than the one before it. By 2017, you’ll see a full host of highly automated systems available on cars, and not just on expensive ones. Tesla’s lower-cost Model 3 will undoubtedly offer it, as will many others. By automotive standards, 2017 is just one mid-cycle refresh away. It’s the blink of an eye. From there, Tesla runs into the same challenges facing everyone working on self-driving technology. The first, and perhaps the biggest, is a protracted policy battle: self-driving cars are finding friends in politics one state at a time, and only four states currently have laws on the books for provisional licensing of autonomous cars. The rules don’t rewrite themselves overnight, and there are still plenty of questions to be answered about how these cars will function in real-world situations and distribute liability. Even if fully driverless vehicles were ready today, it’d take years before they were broadly legal to use in all conditions nationwide. ""Tesla’s a Silicon Valley company,"" Musk noted in a recent CNNMoney interview about autonomous driving. ""If we’re not the leader, shame on us."" And yes, Tesla will be first to market with a particular set of autonomous features — but other automakers came before it, and more will follow. Each launch advances the self-driving conversation a quarter notch. Ultimately, it’s not going to be about who’s first — it’ll be about getting millions of driverless vehicles on roads large and small, safely, with nary an incident in sight.",0.5518119543901483,0.4481880456098517,0.5718317330372837,901,5.1009988901220868,490,6.2469387755102037,0,0,"Transportation, Report",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

My pilot Petr Kopfstein — who was about to hold my stomach (and my life) in his hands — said it with an easy smile, so I responded with a laugh. I thought he was joking. He wasn’t. The Red Bull Air Race series was started in 2003, pitting a dozen of the world’s fastest pilots against each other in timed laps where they maneuver around 82-foot-tall inflatable pylons. But while other sports the energy drink company is involved with — motocross, skydiving, base-jumping, so on — focus heavily on thrill-seeking, the Air Race is all about discipline. As I found out firsthand, it’s more than just a race. It challenges pilots to remain precise while taking calculated risks and enduring a physical toll. A mistake doesn’t just lead to a damaged vehicle or a broken bone — it’s the difference between life and death.   Kopfstein, a three-time Czech aerobatics champion, races in the Red Bull Air Race's Challenger Cup — a second tier for up-and-comers to prove their mettle before graduating to the Master Class. He gave me a puzzled look and affirmed his statement: I really was about to experience a 10-minute stunt flight from the front seat of a two-seater plane. While safety is king in this community, it was hard not to notice where things could go wrong. I signed numerous waivers that warned me of death, dismemberment, and the need to settle disputes in an Austrian court. My share of the cockpit had rudder pedals and a stick of its own that were mapped to Kopfstein’s behind me, and I was thoroughly warned to avoid touching both at all costs. As I was lifted into the sky it was obvious that, for better or worse, I was in for a perspective-altering experience. Carved out of the cratered ground a dozen miles northeast of the Vegas Strip, out where the speed limit stretches to 75mph and the only neighbor around is Nellis Air Force Base, the massive complex that contains Las Vegas Motor Speedway is like Disney World for motorsport enthusiasts. Eight smaller race tracks — some asphalt, some dirt — feature everything from go-karts to exotic supercars. In the mornings, the on-site gas station sports a line of street race-ready cars fueling up before they head out to compete in the shadow of the main track. And at night, people drag-race muscle cars in the empty parking lots until they’ve scared up enough attention from the Speedway’s security, then promptly make a break for it.   So in many adrenaline-filled ways, it made perfect sense that this venue would host the Red Bull Air Race. The United States has hosted the competition before, but always in places like the shores of San Diego or in New Jersey overlooking the Manhattan skyline. And while the 1.5-mile Las Vegas tri-oval superspeedway is known best for showcasing wildly popular four-wheeled events like NASCAR and IndyCar, Red Bull thinks it has a product that can become just as big. Until recently, the path to that success seemed doomed thanks to a few extremely close calls involving pilots grazing the water they were racing over and, in one case, crashing and needing rescue. In 2010, the series’ directors suspended events mid-season and took a year to reevaluate their safety measures — an unprecedented move for a major motorsport. A one-year break turned into three, but in April of this year the series finally returned with a more standardized aircraft design that Red Bull says further encourages safety and competition, and a schedule that featured actual speedways like the one here in Sin City. The move to speedways is a clear shot at raising Red Bull Air Racing’s profile, as it brings the action closer to the spectators and lets them mingle more easily with the pilots and crews. (It certainly works for NASCAR week after week.) Back in the air, Kopfstein was running me through simulations of the different race maneuvers as well as some classic aerobatics. All were physically taxing to a complete amateur like me. We performed a number of vertical turns that put over 5 Gs — five times the force of Earth’s gravity — on my body. Because I lacked both the years of muscle-control training and the liquid-filled pressure suit that the pilots wear, that force pulled hard enough on my body that blood started flowing from my brain towards my feet, causing my vision to tunnel and nearly knocking me out. I became glued to my seat, and was focused only on staying conscious. The only futile defenses I could muster were to suck in as much air as I could and open my eyes as wide as possible. Once we finally eased out of those turns, Kopfstein inverted the plane and negotiated a turn that put so much negative g-force on my face that it felt like it might tear right off my skull. It was such a disorienting maneuver that I couldn’t even tell which direction we were flying. Other maneuvers, though, were sheer fun. He flew me through a double-pylon gate like the ones pilots speed through to enter the course on race day. The most enjoyable were the chicane turns, the S-shaped maneuvers around three pylons that mark the beginning of each timed run. Those turns were taken at 180 knots (over 200mph) and had my head rattling against the plane’s canopy despite my best efforts to keep it steady. But the g-forces in these turns were low, and once I got the hang of the rhythm it was like slamming down a mountain on a snowboard. When I wasn’t getting thrashed around in the cockpit, I realized I was too distracted to watch the altimeter or airspeed: off in the distance, fighter jets were taking off from Nellis, and I needed to look toward the horizon to keep my stomach in check. Between bouts of disorientation, a foreboding placard on the instrument panel caught my eye. ""Use of parachute is recommended,"" it read. After a few minutes under the canopy, I could see why. After we landed I wasn’t dizzied from the experience so much as I found myself going through withdrawal; during different parts of the flight my hands and legs were shaking from the adrenaline. When I’ve gone skydiving, I’ve always returned to the Earth elated. At Kopfstein’s mercy, it took 45 minutes before I felt like myself again. I absolutely loved the experience, but my Red Bull Air Race flight left me physically and mentally drained.   On my way out of the speedway on the final day, I noticed a tent in a fan-accessible area that promised ""90 seconds of the race experience."" Inside, I found eight Oculus Rift headsets attached to pilot’s helmets. I signed yet another waiver and strapped one on. To my surprise, the scale of the virtual plane and the perspective it featured were almost identical to my view from Kopfstein’s plane two days earlier. The movements felt accurate, I was able to scan for the horizon during the vertical turns, and — unlike the real thing — I didn’t have to keep my feet off of the rudder pedals or worry about blacking out. Aside from the low resolution of the first-generation Rift developer kit they were using, it made for a pretty cool experience. But all the fun stuff was absent — no blinding g-forces, no hanging from my safety straps while flying inverted, no deafening engine hum, and definitely no adrenaline rush. Almost everyone who tried it left the tent with a grin, but one man looked a little apathetic as his virtual flight ended. ""I’d rather do the real thing,"" he said as he handed back his helmet. I couldn’t agree more.",0.63623436527775,0.36376563472225,0.8060008964815729,1323,4.7157974300831444,699,6.1230329041487837,0,28,"Transportation, Report",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

In her latest show, ""Connective Tissue,"" the artist takes the increasingly common image of an MRI-like cross-section of a human body and recreates it with swirls of tightly wound paper under glass. Most of the images come from the Visible Human project, a research database maintained by the National Library of Medicine, along with some 19th century medical texts — so everything you see here is anatomically accurate, and each body once belonged to a living person. The technique is called quilling, an old method for turning small strips of paper into visually striking coils. Nilsson says the key is how the coiled paper flows into all the available space. ""Coils can conform to completely fill a space or cavity,"" Nilsson says, just like organs inside a body. The material itself is Japanese mulberry paper, mixed like paint to get the perfect color for each body part, ranging from pink-gray brain to deep-red muscle. The result feels both fleshy and surreal, a combination of dainty craft and the messiness of the human machine.  For anatomical work, Nilsson limits herself to 12 different colors, introducing other tones only sparingly. The show combines flat specimen-style boxes with standing cameos. Nilsson was inspired by early anatomy photographs from Christian Braune and Eugène-Louis Doyen. This piece shows a human torso in cross-section. The pink of the brain is actually a combination of pink, ivory, and tan paper, to get what Nilsson calls ""that fleshy not-quite-pink."" Fat deposits are represented by tight coils of yellow-tan paper. To cover the glass boxes, Nilsson repurposed old hardcover book binding. Larger muscle structures get more intricate shading, moving between light pinks and deeper wine-tinged reds.

Every pixel you change, color you swap, and drop-shadow you alter will get seen 22 billion times per day, Facebook says. So, the company hasn't bothered much with rethinking the look of the Like button since it launched in 2010. Back then, even Facebook itself couldn't have predicted the scale the Like button would reach. Its presence is almost guaranteed on most websites, and it's considered ""one of Facebook's most valuable brand assets,"" product manager Ling Bao says.  ""Getting a design that works across all these websites at different scales and in different browsers is quite a herculean task."" Today, Facebook is debuting a new version of the Like button, a vibrant blue design with Helvetica type that makes its previous version (pictured below) look old and pale. Perhaps more importantly, Facebook killed its signature ""thumbs up"" symbol in favor of a Facebook ""F"" and the word ""Like,"" which appear on every one of various button layouts you can choose. Giving the button a fresh coat of paint is easier said than done, however. ""It's not easy designing a button used by the whole internet,"" Bao says. ""This product has a lot of unique constraints, and is used by so many sites in different contexts.""  One such constraint is that the Like button is used by an incredible variety of browsers — both new ones and old ones, Bao says. ""Like"" needs to translate to hundreds of languages without breaking the button or spilling onto the next line. ""'They're just buttons, why did it take so long?' you ask, but getting a design that works across all these websites at different scales and in different browsers is quite a herculean task,"" he says. Not only that, but Bao needed to get the design approved from the company's designers, vice presidents, legal team, and even CEO Mark Zuckerberg himself. The entire effort took about six months from beginning to end. Aside from design, Facebook is also pairing its Like and Share buttons in hopes that websites will include both. Most people might not know the difference between them, but Bao emphasizes that there's a distinction. The Like button instantly posts content to Facebook, while the Share button lets you add a comment before posting, or lets you share the content in a specific place like a private message. In Facebook's tests, the new buttons got clicked more often than the old ones, possibly because they're a bolder, more visible color.

I'd heard that Nine Hours, a capsule hotel in Kyoto known for its stark sci-fi design and innovative sleeping technology, would be closing down at the end of October, and I knew I'd have to make the trip across Japan while I still had time. Capsule hotels are up there with sushi and Hello Kitty in the pantheon of things that foreigners think about when they think about Japan, and yet I'd never actually stayed in one despite close to five years spent living here. They don't have the best image within the country — seedy, dirty, and often less than safe. They've been around since the '70s, and the majority of their user base in the following decades appears to have been mostly made up of drunk office workers looking for a place to crash after missing their last train.  Nine Hours is as removed from that image as any hotel with coffin-sized rooms could be. Although it's situated near Kyoto's beautiful, traditional geisha district of Gion, the hotel is relentlessly clean and futuristic, with monochrome décor and minimalist iconography. It seems less suited to drunk salarymen than clinical robots in a Björk video. One hour to get ready, seven hours to sleep, one hour to get up The hotel's name refers to the idea that you'd only need to spend nine hours there — a radical concept in a world of lodging that offers a host of amenities to tempt you away from the place you're actually meant to be visiting. But the people behind Nine Hours believe you're better off spending as little time as possible under their roof: just one hour to get ready for bed, seven hours to sleep, and one hour to get up in the morning. Of course, the timing isn't strictly enforced — guests can actually stay up to 17 hours a night, which costs just ¥4,800 ($49).  None of this is to say that the time I spent at Nine Hours was uncomfortable. Quite the opposite — the interior was immaculate, and the hotel's sleeping pods are carefully designed to induce ultimate relaxation. Each is fitted with a Panasonic-built sleeping system that gently lulls you to sleep and wakes you up at a set time by modulating the light. This is relaxing for each individual guest, but more importantly it's less abrasive to the others with whom you sleep in such proximity. The capsules are amazingly comfortable — even for someone like me who's 6 foot 4 — with more space than the average single bed, high-quality sheets, and a crescent-shaped pillow that curves around your shoulders.  Nine Hours is almost entirely devoid of color. The signs and text inside are color-coded by gender — red for female, black for male. Since there are separate floors and even elevators for men and women, just about the only splash of color I saw was the Nine Hours-branded, curiously bright green shower gel in the bathing facilities, which otherwise looks like Dieter Rams' long-lost blueprint for a hot spring.  This dogged dedication to minimalism isn't always for the best. The automatic lights in the bathroom, which you'd think would remove that unnecessary process of pressing the switch yourself, are a little too eager to turn off if you linger too long without making sudden movements. The elevator is so quiet and smooth that I honestly thought it was broken. And the standard-issue Japanese-style sleeping clothes, while comfortable, perhaps hinted a little too strongly that I'd been abducted by a futuristic cult.    Nine Hours opened at the end of 2009, as noted by Designboom at the time; it was the brainchild of Fumie Shibata and her Design Studio S. Masaaki Hiromura was responsible for the beautifully simple graphic design, and Takaaki Nakamura worked on the interior. Despite the odd niggle, it's a hugely impressive show of its creators' talents that feels like the ultimate realization of the capsule hotel concept. But Nine Hours closed at the end of October, with no indication given as to why. A message left on the website, which is now offline, simply said that the hotel would be ending service on the 31st, and Design Studio S didn't respond to an inquiry. It's a real shame — had it stayed open, I'd have recommended any visitors to Kyoto spend as little time as possible in one of the more interesting hotels I'd ever seen. Update: All is not lost — the URL for the Nine Hours website, which was previously offline, now redirects to a new page that says the hotel has re-opened under new management. Guests are now able to stay up to 24 hours.",0.420458342787164,0.579541657212836,0.16626321513683762,806,4.6960297766749379,435,5.9103448275862069,0,0,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

So far, however, most of the apps on the platform have simply transplanted the functionality of their smartphone software to a screen much closer to your face. The New York Times and Twitter, for example, push updates users can scan hands-free. But there is one company playing with the possibilities Glass provides for augmented reality — and making some money to boot. The Fancy is a New York ecommerce startup known for its ties to the world of high fashion and luxury goods. Its Glass app allows users to snap a picture of objects they see in the real world, then finds them matching or complementary items with similar styles and color they can purchase. It’s a clever use of the technology that has made The Fancy the first company to actually make money on Google Glass.   Because of the intimate nature of Glass, Google has been careful about allowing commerce onto the platform. The terms of service for the API it opened up to developers specifically prohibit them from charging for apps or showing commercials. But it didn’t say anything about in-app purchases, a strange loophole that was perhaps deemed less invasive than advertising. People using the Fancy app on Glass have purchased everything from clothes to jewelry, kids toys to kitchenware. ""The spontaneity of being able to discover and buy things you'll love based on what's right in front of your eyes is pretty compelling,"" says Fancy founder and CEO Joe Einhorn.  ""We see a mix of people using the app: from the high-tech interior designer looking to decorate a space to the stylist that wants to match accessories with a fashionista's outfit."" In other words, while the Glass app isn’t a big money-maker for the company, it adds to the startup’s stylish aura and helps its stand out among a certain set of tastemakers. So far Google Glass has been limited to a group of select explorers and, at $1,500, is a bit pricey for the average consumer. But it’s a good match for shoppers on The Fancy, which counts Francois Henri-Pinault among its investors and board members. Pinault is the chairman of PPR, the luxury goods giant which owns Gucci, Bottega Veneta, Yves Saint Laurent and Balenciaga. The front page of The Fancy regularly features high-end fashion items that retail for thousands of dollars. And while Google Glass has been mocked as the item most likely to mark users as nerdy rich ""Glasshole,"" the company has made an effort to bring its product into the fashion world. Apps that enhance, not compete with, the real world Google announced recently that it will be ramping up production of Glass units, tripling the number of Explorer models available to the public, and making accessories like earbuds and perhaps prescription lenses. So far the Glass team seems pleased with how The Fancy is leveraging class. ""One of the philosophies we like to remember when thinking of cool new Glassware is ‘the world is the experience,’"" says Timothy Jordan, a developer advocate with the Glass team. ""That is to say, developers building  for Glass shouldn't create experiences that compete with the world."" Rather, believes Jordan, they should be upgrading a users ability to find value in the world around them. For The Fancy, that philosophy means literally helping to put a price tag on items that catch a user's eye.",0.8962219507326068,0.1037780492673932,0.6326020719566205,613,4.8287112561174554,349,6.0372492836676219,0,0,"Apps, Business, Design, Tech, Report",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

He'll be replaced by Moray Callum, an accomplished designer in his own right (he worked with Tesla chief designer Franz von Holzhausen when both were at Mazda) and the younger brother of famed Jaguar creative lead Ian Callum. Mays leaves behind an impressive resume. Volkswagen's Concept One — the design study that ultimately led to the Beetle's return — vaulted him to the elite ranks of a tight-knit business dominated by big personalities. It also set him up to take the creative reins at Ford, where he led the staff that produced a revitalized Mustang and classics like the GT supercar. Here's a look at some of the most notable designs that left the studio under Mays' watch. Update: An earlier version of this article incorrectly identified the designer of the Ford Shelby GR-1 as Henrik Fisker; it was designed by George Saridakis at the studio Fisker led at the time. We apologize for the error.  BMW 8 Series (E31). Mays had a brief stint with BMW in the 1980s, working on the company's high-end (and highly collectible) coupe. Audi Avus. Unveiled in 1991, the Avus — a defining design in Mays' career — quite literally looked like it was from the future. And its specs were as impressive as its polished finish: it featured an all-aluminum body to save weight (unheard of at the time) and a W12 engine. The design and technical prowess of the Avus would later find its way into a variety of production Audi models. Audi TT Concept. The lines of Mays' earlier Avus can clearly be seen in the 1995 TT Concept, a car that would help remake Audi's image when it went on sale in 1998. Volkswagen Concept One. Tasked with remaking the iconic ""people's car,"" perhaps no automobile in Mays' pre-Ford career has made a bigger impact than the Concept One, which we would eventually come to know as the New Beetle. Ford Thunderbird. It wasn't long after the Concept One that Mays left Volkswagen to start a 16-year tenure at Ford. One of his early projects was the Thunderbird, which — like the New Beetle — was commissioned to revive an iconic brand. 2005 Ford Mustang. The redesigned ""pony car"" was a return to the Mustang's roots, incorporating cues from the Mustang's heyday of the 60s and early 70s. Ford GT. A remake of Ford's GT40 racer of the 60s, the GT was penned by Camilo Pardo under Mays' guidance.  By the time of its debut in 2002, Mays had already established himself as a specialist in ""retro"" revivals with the Concept One and Thunderbird. Ford Shelby GR-1. Rolled out in 2005, the stunning, polished GR-1 was penned by George Saridakis under the direction of another legendary designer, Henrik Fisker, with Mays at the helm.

Unlike Heartbleed, Bash attacks allow for remote code execution, allowing an attacker to exploit the vulnerability for malware distribution. Most attacks from the bug will target web servers and network devices, with experts saying that PHP-based web applications will be particularly vulnerable. Connected devices like smart appliances are also expected to be vulnerable in the long-term, since the devices are often slow to be patched, but early reports indicate an alarming number of systems may be at risk. As Kaspersky Lab's David Jacoby put it, ""the real scale of the problem is not yet clear."" ""They'll likely have compromised most of the systems I've found by tomorrow morning."" In one early census, Errata Security's Robert David Graham ran a limited IP scan and found 3,000 vulnerable systems before the scan crashed, noting that embedded webservers on odd ports were particularly at risk. A few hours later, Graham discovered that someone was already using the same tactics toward less savory ends. ""Someone is using masscan to deliver malware,"" Graham wrote in an update. ""They'll likely have compromised most of the systems I've found by tomorrow morning."" The result is now known as the ""Thanks, Rob"" worm, and it has many experts worried about short-term attacks that might take place before devices are patched. Because most network hardware runs on UNIX-based software, a lot of the routers and switches that make up the internet will be vulnerable to the attack, allowing attacks to spiral out of control. Writing for Security Current, Richard Stiennon notes, ""[This code] could quickly create a SQL Slammer type Internet meltdown,"" referring to a 2003 attack that dramatically slowed down global internet traffic. Oh hey. This thing could bring down the whole internet for a few hours. I'm going to cry in the corner for a minute.  Network operators confirm that the bug is being actively exploited. The content delivery network CloudFlare rolled out web-application firewall rules yesterday to protect its sites, but since then, hackers have tried out a wide variety of attacks using the dangerous new tool. ""We've seen attackers trying to grab password files, download malware onto machines, get remote access, and more,"" says Cloudflare's John Graham-Cumming. ""There was even one attack that involved opening or closing a server's CD / DVD drive."" Higher-level network hardware may also be vulnerable. Researcher and journalist Ashkan Soltani says the most alarming attack vector he's seen is a Bash vulnerability on F5 Security's BIG IP service, which serves as a smart gateway sitting between web applications and users. The vulnerability itself is of limited-use — you'd have to be an authenticated F5 user to make the attack work — but it hints at a much larger and more troubling kind of Bash attack. ""Many of the high-end networking systems are built atop a Linux / Unix platform that can often times be vulnerable,"" Soltani says. ""A vulnerability in a core networking equipment is significantly more problematic than of a single user's computer since it allows redirection and man-in-the-middle on a mass scale."" In the short-term, we're left with a race between IT crews and malware-spreading attackers. Patches have been issued for various Linux distributions, but many in the community believe those patches will only be useful to buy time for a more permanent fix.

There are hundreds of connected devices on the market, but competing standards mean they often can’t talk to one another or learn your routines. Consumers need a half-dozen different apps to manage it all, making the process feel more like a chore than a futuristic butler. Even in January of 2014 we felt firmly stuck with the dumb state of the smart home.   In the last few months, however, a new player has emerged, an unexpected front-runner cleaning up this mess and making the smart home a mainstream reality. Wink is a small New York startup that launched in June of 2014 with a $79 box that promised to tie together devices across competing standards: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Zigbee, and Z-wave. Plenty of other companies had tried the same thing, but what made Wink different was the wide array of big-name partnerships that vaulted it from unknown rookie to the company with the most shelf space in the US market.     Honeywell, Philips, Chamberlain, Schlage, GE and others are all creating Wink-compatible products, together creating a universe of 15 major manufacturers and more than 100 products that play nicely on a single platform. Meanwhile, massive merchants like Home Depot and Amazon are marketing the Wink brand. Home Depot in particular is doing the legwork of informing consumers which devices tie together and how to use Wink to control them, with in-store displays and trained sales associates pushing its ecosystem in over 2,000 locations. ""[Wink is] a potential dark horse to become the leader in this space,"" says Ben Arnold, an analyst with NPD Group. Research from NPD found that 48 percent of consumers were interested in owning connected devices, and that the most popular spot to look for one was a home improvement and hardware store. ""With the retail partnership in place, Wink is going to have the advantage getting in front of consumers, solving the biggest challenges in the market right now: awareness and education.""     Today Wink is announcing its second major product,  Relay: a touchscreen that acts as a command and control center for all your connected devices. ""Maybe you’re getting out of the shower or cooking up dinner and you don’t want a phone in hand,"" says Nathan Smith, Wink's co-founder and head of technology. ""We felt like there was an opportunity to offer the same power and flexibility we do in the Wink mobile app, but in a central place in your home that is always on, and doesn’t require an additional device to operate."" The Relay, which retails for $300 and is available for pre-sale today on Amazon and Home Depot, is an acknowledgement that most ""smart"" homes are still a mix of both connected and ""dumb"" devices sitting side by side. Wink’s goal is ensure that no matter what connected device the consumer owns, it just works. There’s a certain irony to removing the smartphone from the smart home equation, but also a mainstream accessibility that has become Wink’s signature. The Relay is designed to connect to standard wiring on any light switch, but will require an expert to install if you don't feel comfortable with basic electrical work. It has a touch screen where you can program your devices to work in sync and and two physical buttons that will execute preprogrammed routines like shutting the house down for the night or powering up everything in the morning. The Relay runs on Android and, like the Wink Hub, can communicate with devices using Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and radio standards like Zigbee. Because it's connected directly to your grid, the routines you program will work even if your Wi-Fi goes down, making the Relay a nice back-up for the mobile app, especially if you have Time Warner internet like me. It's also helpful when you have children, or perhaps guests visiting, who don't necessarily have the Wink app on their device. The goal is to restore some of the analog simplicity of a tactile switch while preserving the functionality and personalization you expect from a smart home. For nearly a decade Brett Worthington, now the general manager at Wink, worked at an industrial conglomerate that made everything from steam drills to home air conditioners. He was eventually tasked with helping the venerable corporation move into the new and exciting market of connected devices. It was a painful experience. ""I tried to explain, you’re gonna get disrupted.""His bosses wanted to win in the smart home space, but weren’t willing to commit major resources until they saw more consumers adopting the technology.  ""I tried to explain, you’re gonna get disrupted. Look at Blackberry, which had 90 percent market share. Waiting for things to change before you commit, that’s how companies go bankrupt."" Eventually, Worthington had more than argument to prove that point. ""I remember when the Nest came out, and it was just a slap in the face. We had been working on our own smart thermostat but never got any momentum with the project."" He went to his bosses and declared, ""A little startup just kicked your ass, because you are so stuck in this engineering rut that you aren’t innovating on design and interface, you’re not delighting the consumer."" As he set out to help build Wink, Worthington kept those hard lessons in mind. ""You have to make a statement to wake people up and let them know this time will be different,"" he explains. ""It takes battle scars like mine to appreciate how big you really need to go in order to make this dream succeed."" Going big meant getting in front of the most customers possible, and that’s where Home Depot comes in.   ""Nobody walks in here and says, ‘Give me the smart home!’"" explains Jeff Epstein, Home Depot’s vice president of merchandising. Only a few early adopters and gadget lovers arrive with visions of a Jetsons-era playpad dancing in their heads. ""Most people are looking to replace a broken water heater or garage door,"" he says. ""We’re showing them different options and explaining that, for a few dollars more, they can get the additional benefits of a connected device."" Home Depot already had something like 600 connected devices on its shelves when Wink debuted, Epstein says, ""but none of them were talking to one another."" The items were arranged by product category, mixed in with dozens of other choices, with no clear way to indicate which ones had smart features. ""With Wink, we’ve got a story that we’re telling across the store now. You can look for the label, you see the end cap displays, and our associates are trained to explain how everything works with the app, the hub, and each other."" Having a platform story to tell has helped to boost sales of connected devices across the company’s massive retail footprint. ""We’ve been very pleased with the results."" Customers may not come into the store dreaming of a fully tricked-out smart home, but once people buy a first connected device, they are likely to buy more. Wink found that consumers who purchased its hub typically doubled the number of connected devices in their home in the 30 days that followed. Its biggest competitor, SmartThings, released a similar statistic, noting that the average customer has gone from five to ten connected devices over the last six months, with users opening the app four times a day and receiving fifteen notifications per day.   We’re at a tipping point for smart home adoption. One in five Americans now own a home appliance that’s connected to the internet, and in a recent study a two-thirds majority said they would purchase a connected device if it helped them save on their utility bills or increase home security. The question is, who is going to power your ecosystem? In January of this year, Google purchased Nest for $3.2 billion. May brought the announcement that Microsoft was partnering with SmartLabs’ Insteon to sell connected-home kits that work well with its desktop and mobile offerings. In June Apple introduced the world to HomeKit, aiming to make your iPhone and Apple Watch the universal remote for your smarthome. And with Samsung’s purchase of SmartThings in August the lineup was complete: each of the biggest forces in mobile wants to be the owner of your smart home experience. Who is going to power your smart home ecosystem?  That puts Wink in a unique, perhaps advantageous position. It doesn’t sell its own connected devices, so big retailers like Amazon and Home Depot can push its platform without alienating other manufacturers. And Wink can work directly with companies like Phillips, Bosch, and Honeywell during the development phase of a new lightbulb, washing machine, or thermostat, because it has no plans to make competing products. Quirky, Wink’s parent company, does do crowdsourced innovation, but the two companies have established a legal firewall preventing the sharing of information. Wink’s product partners seem satisfied with that. According to sources familiar with the negotiations, Wink is preparing to announce another partnership with a massive American retailer, along the lines of a Target or Lowe's, that would put its brand in front of even more consumers. ""We’re not worried about all the big new players, it’s exciting, it’s a good sign for the space,"" says Nathan Smith, Wink’s co-founder. "" We don’t see ourselves as direct competitors with those companies. People keep asking, who’s going to win the war for the smart home? But that’s the wrong question. It’s way too big to be controlled by a single company. It’s like saying in 1999, ‘Who’s going to win the Internet?"" Smith says Wink is focused on becoming the brand the most consumers know and trust, the one that works with every device, no matter who built it or what technology it uses to communicate. The Relay is part of that. ""Part of the goal was to put a lot of runway in here. We want it to work with any smart device you bring into your home, even ones that haven’t been created yet.""

Thirteen Asian elephants will continue to tour with the company for a few more years before retiring to Ringling's Center for Elephant Conservation in central Florida by 2018.  The company cited growing public concern for animal welfare and a ""mood shift"" from audiences as the reason behind its decision. Company president Kenneth Feld also claimed it was getting too expensive to fight anti-elephant legislation in cities around the US.

This ""ambiguity"" is what has led Seoul's government to accuse Uber of running an illegal taxi service. Ever since the ride-hailing app launched in South Korea's capital in 2013 it has had to fight an uphill battle, with officials planning to build their own GPS-enabled taxi app, and even offering locals rewards of 1 million KRW (around $900) for reporting illegal Uber drivers.

Some countries — like the UK — will not be affected This change will primarily affect France and Luxembourg — the two countries that prompted the ruling after petitioning the EU's Court of Justice (ECJ) to be allowed to sell ebooks at the VAT rate of paper books.

Countries that already sell ebooks at the higher tax rate — such as the UK and Germany — will not be affected. The ruling also won't affect US companies like Amazon, which previously sold ebooks via Luxembourg to take advantage of the country's lower VAT. Legislation that came into force earlier this year closed this loophole, ruling that VAT for digital goods should be levied at the rate of the country the customer is based in.

The brief, which was filed today by law firm Morgan Lewis, actually makes a business case for legalizing same-sex marriage across the country. It claims that the currently muddled and confusing legal landscape surrounding same-sex marriage ""places significant burdens on employers and their employees — making it increasingly hard to conduct business."" The brief argues that the varying state laws around marriage equality makes it harder and more costly for companies to attract and recruit top talent and administer benefits to employees who aren't allowed to marry, among other issues. It's not just huge tech companies coming out in support here, either — the businesses range from smaller, family-owned businesses all the way up to giants like Coca-Cola, Pepsi, Comcast, Levi's, Nike, Proctor & Gamble, Wells Fargo, United Airlines, and dozens more. The amicus brief was filed in the Supreme Court case of Obergefell v. Hodges, one of several cases that it will hear in April surrounding the marriage equality issue. The Supreme Court's ruling is expected to decide whether the Constitution protects the rights of same-sex couples to marry regardless of what state they live in, or whether specific states are allowed to continue forbidding gay marriage. Currently, 36 states and Washington, DC allow same-sex marriage; some estimates state that as much as 70 percent of the country lives in an area where same-sex marriage is allowed.

""Our ability to carry out our responsibilities for human intelligence and national security responsibilities has become more challenging,"" Brennan said. ""And so what we need to do as an agency is make sure we’re able to understand all of the aspects of that digital environment."" It's an attempt to ""cover the entire universe."" Brennan ambitiously called the plan an attempt to ""cover the entire universe"" and ensure that intelligence doesn't fall through bureaucratic cracks when moving between agency units. The announcement comes amidst several controversies that have rocked the CIA recently. It's only been a few months since the agency was caught lying about the details of US torture, and this past summer it admitted to spying on Congress. But the plan seems more concerned with responding to threats against the US than fixing the CIA's internal problems. Among the changes outlined today is the creation of 10 new ""mission centers"" that will pair spies with intelligence analysts and focus on areas like counter-terrorism, espionage, and weapon storage, The New York Times reports. Brennan hopes to remove confusion about which agency limbs are responsible for tracking certain threats. Thousands of spies will be reassigned. The White House has backed the plan, but some intelligence officials see the reorganization as short-sighted. Mark Lowenthal, a former senior CIA official, said the reorganization ""is not going to go down smoothly."" He claimed the plans lack a focus on the future and too strongly prioritize day-to-day concerns. This is the government's latest step towards improving cybersecurity. Last month, the Obama administration announced the creation of the Cyber Threat Intelligence Integration Center (CTIIC), a 50-person agency responsible for analyzing and coordinating responses to cyberthreats. The CIA has teased these changes for months, but today is the first time the agency has laid out its plan in detail.

As AFP reports, a Paris high court this week ruled that it has jurisdiction to decide a case brought by a French teacher whose Facebook account was suspended after he posted a photo of l'Origine du Monde — a famous 19th century painting of a woman's vagina. The man, whose name has not been disclosed, filed a complaint against Facebook in a French court, arguing that his rights to free speech had been compromised because the social network could not distinguish pornography from art. The painting in question, by Gustave Courbet, is on display at the Musée d'Orsay in Paris. In a January hearing, Facebook's lawyer argued that French courts have no jurisdiction in the case, because the man had agreed to the site's terms, which specifies that legal complaints against the company can only be heard in California courts. But Paris' high court disagreed, saying that the clause is ""abusive"" Thursday in a ruling that could set an important precedent for Facebook and other US tech companies. Immediately following the ruling, the plaintiff's lawyer described it as a ""first victory won by David against Goliath."" ""first victory won by David against Goliath."" ""This decision will create jurisprudence for other social media and other internet giants who use their being headquartered abroad, mainly in the United States, to attempt to evade French law,"" Stephane Cottineau, the teacher's lawyer, said following the decision. The teacher is seeking €20,000 ($21,900) in damages, according to French daily Le Figaro. Nudity and other explicit content are banned from Facebook, per the site's community standards, though the company's combination of algorithms and outsourced moderators have had trouble distinguishing art from smut in the past. ""We aspire to respect people’s right to share content of personal importance,"" the policy states, ""whether those are photos of a sculpture like Michelangelo's David or family photos of a child breastfeeding."" The company tells AFP that it has noted the ruling and is considering a response. The ruling also comes at a time when French authorities are looking to exercise greater control over social networking websites, following January's Charlie Hebdo jihadist attacks.

Disney has a new live-action thriller on the horizon, and its trailer has me reaching for the nearest lifejacket / PFD. The Finest Hours is an adaptation of Michael J.

Chris Pine is set to star as Captain Bernie Webber, the leader of the rescue expedition, with Casey Affleck, Ben Foster, and Eric Bana in supporting roles. This is the latest entry on what's become an interesting résumé for Gillespie, one stocked with a wide variety of films. He's directed indie darlings (Lars and the Real Girl), horror played for laughs (his 2011 Fright Night remake), and a prototypical sports movie; this is his first crack at an action tentpole. (He was also attached to Dallas Buyers Club before it ended up an award winner in the hands of Jean-Marc Vallée.) Gillespie's still waiting on a major box office hit Those movies were all critically successful — Lars and the Real Girl was particularly acclaimed, earning an Oscar nomination for writing and Golden Globe / SAG nods for Gosling's performance — but none of them became a box office smash. (At $41 million, Fright Night is Gillespie's highest grossing film to date.) They weren't shot and written like blockbusters-in-waiting, either. Lars and the Real Girl was weird, subtle, and touching, but not a fit for wide audiences; Million Dollar Arm was warm and traditional, but more intriguing as a part of Disney's developing international strategy than as a potential sleeper hit. The Finest Hours looks like Gillespie's safest bet to date, and he and Disney must be hoping the combination of an inspiring story, Pine's emergent star power, and his directorial goodwill turn the movie into an all-around success. From the looks of the trailer, he has plenty to work with here: churning seas, stormy February skies, and some meaty Massachusetts accent work from Pine and his comrades.

We were living in the era of gritty superheroes, I argued, and there was no way to buy into the idea of a buff outer space god and his magic hammer unless the movie was couched in some sort of pseudo-science. Thor, Iron Man, and other early Marvel movies did their best to keep their comic bookiness at arm’s length — and world domination ensued.   But you can only hold one note for so long, and as Marvel has spread its wings with stranger characters, the results have been mixed. Guardians of the Galaxy managed to pull off a tree named Groot and a talking raccoon thanks to its singular, rock n’ roll attitude, but Avengers: Age of Ultron collapsed beneath the weight of a jovial Spaderbot and a mess of inexplicable mythology.   Now it’s time for Ant-Man, and it’s hard to remember any Marvel movie that’s been viewed with more skepticism. Not only is it arguably the most ludicrous Marvel movie character yet, but the film is better known for the director that left it — Hot Fuzz’s Edgar Wright — than the one that made it. Ant-Man has been cloaked in a haze of preordained failure, and I fully expected it to follow Ultron as Marvel’s second confused disappointment of the year.  I love it when I’m wrong. Ant-Man opens dark and violent, with Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) in jail, moments away from getting pummelled by a gang — until we realize it’s all just a going-away ritual and he’s among friends. It’s a small bit of sleight of hand, but it sets the tone for everything that follows. Lang is a former cat burglar, and after his release, he just wants to make enough money for child support so he can reconnect with his estranged young daughter. But it’s hard out there for Paul Rudd, and soon Lang finds himself lured back to crime by his friend Luis (a hilarious Michael Peña, constantly riffing and stealing every scene he’s in). During the job, Lang finds a suit that — surprise! — shrinks him down to the size of an ant. Soon he finds himself getting trained by both Dr. Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), the genius creator of the suit, and Pym’s daughter Hope van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly). The suit’s shrinking technology has been copied by Pym’s former protégé, it turns out, and Hank wants Scott to keep the technology from falling into the wrong hands. Here’s some real talk: this set-up is dumb. The whole concept of an insect-sized superhero is dumb. The idea of said superhero using mental telepathy to get ants to do his bidding (yes, he does this) is insanely dumb. But Ant-Man knows it’s dumb. Rudd and Anchorman’s Adam McKay rewrote the script after Edgar Wright left the project, and what they’ve constructed is a movie that knows just how skeptical people are going to be, and gets around the problem by winking at nearly every major trope we’ve come to expect from superhero movies. A would-be cathartic emotional scene between Dr. Pym and his daughter is undercut by Lang’s awkward interruption. A training montage is repeatedly aborted due to Lang being, well, terrible. An epic stand-off between Ant-Man and his nemesis is reduced to nothing more than a toy train falling off its track. For as much as it's been touted as a heist movie, Ant-Man is a straight-up mainstream comedy, and like Star-Lord before him, Lang is just a regular guy. His inability to fit cleanly into the hero role previously filled by Thor and Captain America is what makes the whole thing work — and the movie takes advantage of that at every turn. Self-aware blockbusters certainly aren’t new; Phil Lord and Chris Miller have built their career with projects like The Lego Movie, and Jurassic World is using its anti-blockbuster sentiment to beat every record in the book. But unlike those movies, there’s nothing callous or cynical in Ant-Man. Like most Paul Rudd comedies, it’s powered by his goofy, good-guy sentimentality, and whether he was facing off against a surprise guest star or gawking as Peña nailed yet another punchline, I found myself filled with something that’s become a rather rare commodity  in superhero movies: joy. Rudd is certainly an integral part of that, but a tremendous amount of credit also has to go to Peyton Reed. The director, whose resumé includes everything from Bring It On to directing stints on New Girl, dials up a potent combination of whimsy and action while still providing room for secondary characters to flourish (Evangeline Lilly’s Hope in particular is compelling proof that there is room for powerful female characters in this universe beyond just Black Widow). And even though broad comedies are often less than subtle, Reed’s touch is deft, so much so that I nearly forgot what cinematic world he was operating in until the inevitable Marvel post-credits sequence hit the screen. Don’t worry; I’m not going to spoil anything, other than to say that the teaser seems pulled from one of the more serious Marvel movies on the horizon. But after Ant-Man’s effervescent fun, the scene was discomfiting; so ponderous and full of itself that I wanted to take a shower. There I was, the person that once thought these movies could only work if they shied away from their primary color origins, wincing at the grit and gravitas. Ant-Man and Guardians of the Galaxy are proofs of concept, in a strange way — existing far enough away from the main cinematic storyline that they could easily be abandoned as one-offs if they failed. But in their offbeat success, they’re showing Marvel a new way forward, one in which they lean into the ridiculous and embrace the fun. It’s an idea that’s coming just in time. Warner Bros. and DC seem intent on going the other way by creating the most depressing movies of all time, and Marvel itself is prepping a story arc that will be hard to pull off without some kind of wink or nod. (The end game for The Avengers is to have them fight a blue guy with a glove full of cosmic rocks; you do the math.) Ant-Man may be proof that we’ve finally outgrown the era in which directors default to the gritty superhero trope. Comic book films have proven themselves as a genre-straddling and often inventive form, so much so that we can comfortably put the fears of Adam West and George Clooney behind us to embrace everything they have to offer — even the goofiness. Comic book movies that are fun. Who’d have thought? Ant-Man opens July 17th.

Apple has mastered the art of crafting hardware and software that everyone can easily understand. It’s a testament to Apple’s reductive habits — paring down its devices and services until your grandmother can quickly comprehend them — and it’s led to wildly successful products. So now that Apple Music has finally made its way to the masses, we should expect more of the same, right? Well, not so much. Apple Music is messy, slow to load, complicated to setup, and  missing some social features. Apple has created a music service that can be both overwhelming and sparse at the same time.  But despite its shortcomings, I have no doubt Apple Music will be a massive success. We’ve reached the inflection point in streaming music. Only 41 million people actually pay for streaming music worldwide, which creates an opportunity Apple is uniquely able to take advantage of. If you’re one of the 41 million who have been living with streaming music, there’s no killer feature that will compel you to switch to Apple Music. But if you’ve been out of the loop, or just waiting for Apple to make its play, Apple Music may end up being your sonic home. You don’t need to download any extra apps, it has all the music you could want, and you can get a free three month trial for the next 90 days. For users new to streaming music, Apple Music is good enough to get a lot of iPhone users to start paying for streaming music.   Apple Music is made up of five distinct segments: For You, which surfaces all the music that Apple thinks you will enjoy; New, where you can find all of the recent releases and popular music; Radio, which houses Apple Music’s flagship station Beats 1 among other channels; Connect, a platform where artists can share photos, videos, and behind the scenes clips; and My Music, the spot for all of your locally stored and saved music. Apple Music is messy, slow to load, complicated to set up Apple checks all the boxes on the ""here’s how to make a streaming music service"" checklist. Apple Music is $9.99 a month, or $14.99 for families with up to six users. The music catalog exceeds 30 million songs, matching that of Spotify. You can watch music videos just like you can on Tidal. But Apple Music’s biggest advantage is its For You section, and specifically the discovery engine, which is one of the best you will find in any music streaming service. It’s the first tab in the Music app, and where I’ve spent the majority of my time using the service. But to get the most out of that engine, you have to go through a cumbersome set-up process to fully explain to Apple what types of music and which artists you enjoy.  When you open Apple Music for the first time, it will ask you to pick your favorite genres of music and artists by tapping on some red bubbles (once if you like, twice if you love). Those bubbles have been brought over from Beats Music, which Apple acquired last year. What Apple Music doesn’t tell you is these decisions — along with your existing iTunes library — will shape the For You section and likely determine your experience with Apple Music. So don’t double tap on that U2 bubble that shows up thanks to the album you couldn’t get rid of because you just want to get through the menu, or you will be living with The Edge for a long time. But once you’ve set it up (and once you start using the service regularly), For You comes to life in a way that no other music service has been able to accomplish. Constantly surfacing new playlists and albums — many of which have been put together by Apple’s teams of music experts instead of an algorithm — For You is Apple at its best. I would say I’ve clicked on about 80 percent of the playlists Apple has found for me, compared to around 25 percent of the playlists brought up by Spotify. (The ones I’ve skipped are mostly the ""Intro to Every Artist I Already Like"" playlists that Apple keeps dredging up. Does anyone need an intro to Kanye West?) A number of the playlists seem to have been brought over from Beats Music, which is unsurprising given the fact that one of the few things Beats Music did exceptionally well was playlist curation. As you use Apple Music and click the hearts next to songs, albums, and playlists, Apple will continue to reshape For You to your liking. Playlist series like ""Behind The Board,"" which focuses on the producers behind some of your favorite songs, and ""Guest List,"" a collection of collaborations by some of your favorite artists, are just two of the standouts that you’ll find on the service. Apple Music has also included playlists from music magazines like Pitchfork, Dancing Astronaut, and The Fader in the New section. Apple Music's discovery engine is the best of any streaming service Where Apple Music comes up short is in the length of its playlists, which consistently range between 12-16 songs, or about an hour’s worth of music. Apparently Apple Music editors work so much that every recreational activity where music may be necessary must come in under an hour. If you’re one of the 75 million Spotify users who are used to playlists with over 50 songs that are routinely updated, Apple Music will be a bit of a shift. It’s also impossible to search for playlists created by other users. Every search I’ve done has only brought up playlists created by Apple or its curation partners, which is a shame. Apple is betting entirely on its playlist curation team, and while they may be able to create some great playlists, user-created playlists are still incredibly valuable and should not be overlooked. Apple Music is currently available on iOS, Mac, and PC, with an Android app arriving later this year. While it’s great that Apple will soon have its music service on every platform of consequence, so far the apps themselves are confusing and hard to navigate. Apple has a lot of work to do to make things easier to find and use — it’s a surprising misstep for a company that prides itself on simplicity. Apple Music in iOS is a lesson in taking a design ethos and applying it to functionality. While ""less is more"" may be great aesthetically, when it comes to a functioning music service, it’s a shot in the foot. When a song is playing, it takes three nearly impossible-to-find taps to get to the artist or album from the now playing screen (three dot menu, tap on the song title, then tap on the tiny artist link at top). Virtually every other streaming service in existence just lets you tap the artist name from now playing. You also can’t select the bitrate for music playback. Apple Music streams at 256kbps by default, but that automatically downgrades depending on your connection. Apple won’t say what the lower bitrates are, but tests conducted by users have shown it to go as low as 64kbps over cellular. And if you want to stream music over cellular, you have to enable Use Cellular Data in the Settings app, which may also turn on automatic app updates over cellular. You can’t choose to have automatic app updates only over Wi-Fi if you want to stream Apple Music over cellular. Apple Music on the desktop is less than stellar On the desktop, Apple decided against building a stand-alone app and instead shoved Apple Music into iTunes — it’s less than stellar. Nobody likes using iTunes. For the last 15 years iTunes has been a necessary evil if you wanted to have music locally stored in halfway decent fashion on your computer, and now that it’s integrated with Apple Music, there is no escaping iTunes.  Apple Music on the desktop is slow and heavy, and has more than a few times refused to stream music for me. If you want to put a song or album from Apple Music on repeat, you have to go on a scavenger hunt through the menu bar, and it may or may not work. iTunes feels like it was built for the last generation of apps. Spotify’s desktop app is nothing to write home about, but it feels much snappier and lighter than iTunes ever has. Apple focused all its efforts on making browsing and discovering music an enjoyable experience in Apple Music — and it is — but it comes at the expense of a predictable and understandable UI. iTunes is a bloated monster, but at least it's a bloated monster we can understand. But on the iPhone, Apple Music often feels like a beautifully curated maze that you will never find your way out of. It looks great, but when it’s time to actually get somewhere that Apple hasn’t prompted you to go, it can be incredibly difficult. The other two notable parts of Apple Music are Connect, the social network-esque feed in Apple Music, and Beats 1, the 24/7 worldwide radio station (as you will hear repeatedly if you ever turn it on) that is available on Apple Music Radio. Connect gives me flashbacks to Myspace 2.0 Connect is supposed to be Apple’s answer to Spotify’s social sharing and Tidal’s exclusive content — a place where artists can share whatever they want, be it music, photos, or videos. But all I’ve seen are artists (I follow 42 of them) promoting upcoming concerts and appearances on Beats 1 and Apple Music editors promoting playlists. I get a strong Myspace 2.0 flashback every time I open it. (Remember when Justin Timberlake purchased Myspace and got his friends to use it for two weeks?) It’s supposed to make you feel like these artists are your friends, I suppose, but what I actually want from a social network is my actual friends — Spotify and even Rdio are way ahead here.  Beats 1 is the most surprising aspect of Apple Music, and largely why I’ll keep using Apple Music after the three-month trial ends. Beats 1 is live radio every day for 12 hours (followed by 12 hours of repeats for the other side of the world) that plays much better music than your average radio station. It features three flagship hosts — Zane Lowe, Julie Adenuga, and Ebro Darden — along with a cavalcade of rotating hosts, including St. Vincent, Dr. Dre, Elton John, Jaden Smith, Pharrell, and Disclosure. I’m someone who still listens to the radio everyday while I drive. Beats 1 has all but ended my love affair with local radio. Now I just yell at Siri to play Beats 1, and it comes on. (You can yell at Siri to play just about anything with Apple Music, and it’ll happen, which is pretty great.) This is exactly what Apple excels at — creating experiences that need little interaction from you, and Beats 1 is the culmination of that. Though it hasn’t been without problems; last week Beats 1 kept rewinding itself during Ebro’s show, an interview played during a song, and it just refused to come on at all a few times. And if you let it play all day, you will undoubtedly hear Pharrell’s new single ""Freedom"" 4,000 times. But what it does have — no commercials, the ability to play the same songs around the world, and three of the best DJs in the world playing an unpredictable playlist of music better anything you will find on your local radio — far surpasses any other radio station you’ll find on another streaming service. Best of all, you don’t need an Apple Music subscription to listen to Beats 1. Despite its many issues, Apple Music will ultimately be a success If you’re looking for the future of music and the music industry, streaming and Apple Music are it. Yes, it’s full of bugs and glitches and is user friendly to only the most passive of listeners, but it’s still good enough. There are plenty of people who have never used a streaming service and will just be happy being able to listen to whatever they want for a fixed price. Apple still has 800 million credit cards, the world’s most popular phone, and a Taylor Swift exclusive — if it doesn’t succeed it would be a huge disappointment. The good thing for Apple is all of the issues with Apple Music are fixable. The bad thing is we have to live with a messy app until Apple decides to address the issues. Apple Music has made iTunes even more bloated, and it’s going to take a lot of work to build a cohesive product over mobile and desktop. Apple will probably address some of these issues at next year’s WWDC, after touting how many users the service gained, and all will be forgotten. But it doesn’t change the fact that we’re stuck with a problematic streaming service for the next few months. If you’re new to streaming music, there’s nothing that should preclude you from enjoying Apple Music. You can listen to whatever you want, and when it comes down to it, that’s all that matters. But if you’re already subscribed to another music streaming app, there’s not a strong reason to switch right now (unless you really, really, love 1989, and somehow haven’t already purchased it). Apple will once again push the music industry into the future, but that future needs a lot of refinement.

There'll also be an encore presentation in select theatres a few days later on October 4th. The original film, an adaptation of Ted Hughes' 1968 novel The Iron Man, marked Brad Bird's directorial debut. Bird would go on to direct the phenomenally successful Pixar films The Incredibles (2004) and Ratatouille (2007) before leaping into live action with 2011's Mission: Impossible — Ghost Protocol. Tender and thoughtful, The Iron Giant was an instant critical sensation, but it failed to impact the box office in any significant way. The movie influenced a generation of smart, ambitious animation Despite its commercial failure, the movie launched Bird's career and influenced a generation of similarly smart, ambitious animated features. And if you were one of the legions of fans who fell in love with Vin Diesel's Groot in last year's Guardians of the Galaxy, you may have The Iron Giant to thank — Diesel gave an evocative, affecting performance as the titular robot. There's still a lot of information yet to be revealed about the Signature Edition: tickets aren't on sale yet, and we don't know which theaters are going to be showing the movie. (If you're interested, you might want to set an alert — I have a feeling this'll be a hot ticket.) But we do have a poster — Bird tweeted it this afternoon — and a confirmed presence at this week's Comic-Con festivities.

Sony isn't here. And Paramount decided to ditch the show. But by no means does that make this year's San Diego Comic-Con a small event. In fact, some of the biggest names you could hope to see at Comic-Con are still showing up, and it's likely that they'll have some exciting news and previews to show attendees. Star Wars and DC Comics are the clear highlights, but sci-fi, fantasy, superhero, and other fan favorites are all prepared to make a splash on the show floor. If you plan on following along, we've rounded up the biggest events going on each day, what we can expect to see from them, and when you should be prepared for Twitter to collectively lose its mind. All times in PT. Ahead of the main event, Warner Bros. Television will be screening some of its biggest pilots of the year. Those include Lucifer, Blindspot, and Containment, but the biggest ticket by far is Supergirl. Expect to start seeing first impressions pop up later that night. Thursday's biggest stories should come from Lionsgate. The highlight of its event will be new footage from the final Hunger Games film, but the studio has some other new titles to show as well. That includes Vin Diesel's wild new fantasy film, The Last Witch Hunter, which will also show some new footage. Divergent: Allegiant — Part 1 and Alex Proyas' Gods of Egypt may also make an appearance.   Activision is presenting the ""world reveal"" of what it's like to battle zombies in Black Ops III, the latest entry in the Call of Duty franchise. It's the kind of bizarre and indulgent genre mashup that seems perfect for Comic-Con, and the studio promises to have other surprises in store as well.   Two BBC hits will hit Comic-Con on Thursday afternoon, both with Steven Moffat on hand to discuss. There's little detail on what — if anything — we can expect to see, but both series have new seasons in the works for the not-so-distant future. Peter Capaldi will also be there, making his first SDCC appearance.   The Walking Dead still has a fervent fan base, and AMC has plenty to feed it this week. At noon, it's bringing out the cast and producers of The Walking Dead, and an hour later it'll have the cast and creators of its new spinoff, Fear the Walking Dead. It's about time AMC debuted a trailer for that too, right? More than 13 years after the release of Steven Spielberg's classic 2002 sci-fi film, Fox is continuing Philip K. Dick's futuristic crime-fighting story as a TV series. Fox will screen the first episode to Comic-Con attendees and then bring out its cast and creators for a Q&A session on Friday. Anyone want to predict how this'll go? With season five now behind it, HBO is bringing the cast of Game of Thrones to Comic-Con to discuss what went down and what's to come. Stars including Maisie Williams, Gwendoline Christy, and Natalie Dormer are expected to attend. Don't expect too many revelations, but it should be a fun look back. Marvel isn't at Comic-Con this year, but two of its TV shows are, thanks to ABC. The showrunners and cast of Agent Carter and Agents of SHIELD are scheduled to be on hand, and there should be some news about the seasons to come this fall. It's a small blip for the Marvel world, but at least it's something. The biggest panel of the day — and possibly of the show — takes place Friday night. Director J.J. Abrams, writer Lawrence Kasdan, and producer Kathleen Kennedy will show up to discuss the new film as its December release date draws ever nearer. It doesn't sound like Lucasfilm plans on releasing a new trailer this week, but there are still plenty of other Star Wars universe details that the studio could dive into. For those who'd rather steer clear of the bedlam in Hall H, the cast and creators of Orphan Black are dropping by Comic-Con before filming begins for the show's fourth season. The clone herself, Tatiana Maslany, will be on the panel, as well as co-creators John Fawcett and Graeme Mason, chatting about what's ahead for Project Leda and Project Castor. A revival that's perfect for Comic-Con: Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell are bringing back The Evil Dead, and they'll be showing up at Comic-Con to chat about bringing the series to TV 34 years after the release of the original film. The show premieres this fall on Starz, so this week would be perfect timing for a trailer release.   This may be part of the reason Marvel decided to pass on Comic-Con: Warner Bros.' show on Saturday morning is going to be about DC's superheroes in a big way, quite possibly including a good look at Batman v. Superman. Director Zack Snyder will be on the panel, as well as Ben Affleck, Henry Cavill, Jesse Eisenberg, and Gal Gadot. There's a lot riding on this presentation — the buzz coming off of it will likely determine whether DC's slate is a real contender, or if Marvel has nothing to be worried about.   Seth Grahame-Smith's cult hit novel has been around for over five years, but somehow it's only now getting a film adaptation. The cast and director of  Pride and Prejudice and Zombies  will be giving a sneak peek at the quirky mash-up, which is due out in 2016. Comic-Con is the ideal setting to find out if the premise still has the legs — and fans — to make it on the big screen. Quentin Tarantino tends to stay quiet just long enough to get fans excited for his next film, and now his follow up to 2012's Django Unchained is about to arrive. New footage from his western, The Hateful Eight, will likely be shown during Saturday's event, and unspecified members of the film's star-studded cast are expected to make appearances. Plus, any time Tarantino's on stage, it's bound to be entertaining. Legendary Pictures may have multiple movies that it plans to talk about, but there's really only one that matters: Warcraft. The studio is almost certain to finally reveal some glimpses of the highly anticipated adaptation, and even though he's not listed, there's a good bet director Duncan Jones will be on hand to talk about it. It's been a long time coming, so hopefully we'll have even more to look forward to.   There are a good number of upcoming blockbusters and superheroes that Fox could decide to show off on Saturday, and any one of them could make a splash. The most likely candidate is Fantastic 4, which comes out in less than a month. But we could also get some looks at the upcoming X-Men: Apocalypse and fan-favorite Deadpool, both due out next year. No one would mind if some of Deadpool's snarky metahumor showed up. This is NBC's chance to convince literally anyone that giving Heroes another shot is a good idea. We're all excited about the possibility that the show could be great again, but it'll take a lot of persuasion to make former fans really believe in it. A new trailer will be presented at the show, and the miniseries's cast and creator, Tim Kring, will be on hand to discuss the reboot.

Just eight days after Google, manufacturers, and carriers rushed out a fix for Stagefright, researchers at Exodus Intelligence are saying there's a problem with one of the patches, and phones could still be vulnerable under the right circumstances. After the patch was deployed, Exodus was able to trigger a system crash in one phone by attacking it with an appropriately encoded mp4 file over MMS. It's unclear whether the bug could be exploited for code execution as well as system shutdown. Reached for comment, Google confirmed the findings, and said a second patch was already being sent out. ""We’ve already sent the fix to our partners to protect users, and Nexus 4/5/6/7/9/10 and Nexus Player will get the OTA update in the September monthly security update,"" the company said in a statement. It's unclear when non-Nexus phones will get the new patch, but it's likely to be folded into the monthly rolling patch systems established in the wake of Stagefright. Google also emphasized mitigation systems like Address Space Layout Randomization, which make exploiting such a bug a persistent challenge on Android devices. ""We believe we are likely not the only ones to have noticed it is flawed."" Exodus' announcement is an unorthodox way to disclose the bug, since Google has had less than a week to develop and deploy a patch for the bug, far short of the standard 90-day quiet period.

In fact, you can thank it — or curse it — for making flagship smartphones all get so darn huge. But this year, things have changed: now Apple is in the game, and Samsung needs to do something interesting to keep customers coming back. Its solution? Build two new phones. At an event called Unpacked this morning, Samsung unveiled the Galaxy Note 5 and the Galaxy S6 Edge+. They're similar phones in similar packages, but they're Samsung's plays to get attention before the next iPhone comes out. On top of that, Samsung unveiled a mobile payments system and a hardware keyboard add-on. It's a series of strong announcements that should give Samsung fans a lot to look forward to.   Say goodbye to fake leather and plastic. The Note 5 ditches Samsung's tackier sensibilities in favor of a Galaxy S6-style design covered in metal and glass. The Note still has a 5.7-inch Quad HD display and a stylus that pops out of the bottom — it's basically the Note as you already know it made a lot nicer. The only downside: no more removable battery or microSD card slot. It'll go on sale August 21st. The S6 Edge+ is exactly what it sounds like: a huge version of the S6 Edge with a 5.7-inch display. It's every bit as nice — still all metal and glass — but now Samsung is trying to make its key feature, the edge, more useful. The edges can now give you quick access to both your top contacts and your most recently used apps, which should make it quicker to navigate around the big phone. Carriers will begin selling it on August 21st. Samsung wants to make mobile payments even more accessible than Apple Pay. Rather than relying solely on one payment method, Samsung Pay uses a combination of NFC and something called MST, which essentially beams out the magnetic code that card readers normally get from a swipe. It's a neat workaround that's supposed to make Samsung Pay compatible with the vast majority of card readers. It'll be available on the Galaxy S6, S6 Edge, S6 Edge+, and Note 5 starting this September in the US.   For the most part, the Galaxy Note 5 and the S6 Edge+ are using the same camera as the S6, but they're getting one neat new feature: both phones are able to stream live video to YouTube directly from the camera app. Streams can go up to 1080p at 60fps and can be pushed lived immediately. There are, of course, plenty of apps that can do this already, but having it integrated into the phone itself could get even more people broadcasting. One of Samsung's more interesting announcements today was for a small keyboard that attaches to the bottom of the Note 5 and S6 Edge+. It basically does the same thing as the Typo — lets you use Blackberry-esque keys instead of the on-screen keyboard — but it's built specifically to work with these Samsung phones. That allows the phones to adjust their displays to compensate for the fact that the keyboard covers up the bottom of the screen. I guess that's one way of taking advantage of a giant phone. How do you keep an event exciting all the way until the last moment? Use the final moment to tease what's coming next. Samsung closed its show with a quick look at the Gear S2, a new circular smartwatch that it intends to unveil on September 3rd. That's about all we know about it for now, but we're definitely interested. By all means, this looks like the most stylish smartwatch that Samsung has made yet.",0.41392229410643283,0.5860777058935671,0.18354570332089182,630,4.5253968253968253,337,5.4154302670623142,1,7,"Google, Mobile, Tech",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Apple's overall makeup has swayed by 1 percent in the past year, so that women now make up 31 percent of the company. There was also a small increase in the representation of black and Asian employees in the US, who now make up 8 percent and 18 percent of the company, respectively. ""We are proud of the progress we’ve made, and our commitment to diversity is unwavering,"" Apple CEO Tim Cook writes. ""But we know there is a lot more work to be done.""  ""The largest group of employees we’ve ever hired from underrepresented groups."" It's not surprising that, in a huge company like Apple, the overall makeup would only shift slightly from year to year — there are just too many total employees for new hires to make a dramatic difference. But Apple's hiring rates appear to be improving. Cook says that it hired 65 percent more women during the past year than it did the year before that (for a total of 11,000 globally). It hired 50 percent more black employees in the US (2,200) and 66 percent more Hispanic employees in the US (2,700). ""In total, this represents the largest group of employees we’ve ever hired from underrepresented groups in a single year,"" Cook writes.   What matters more is how those figures reflect Apple's actual hiring rates. Globally, 35 percent of Apple's new hires over the past year were women; in the US, 19 percent were Asian, 13 percent were Hispanic, and 11 percent were black. Apple doesn't state what those figures were at last year, but it's likely that they've grown. Overall, white employees still make up the bulk of the company — at 54 percent — and have an even higher representation in both corporate and retail leadership; same goes for men. The fact that tech companies are releasing this data is making Silicon Valley's gender and ethnicity imbalance much more apparent. Now that most of the big tech companies have released at least two years of reports, we can get a much better sense of whether they're actually addressing it. To help, Apple says that it's expanding its recruiting efforts, supporting funds that help students at historically black colleges, and bringing its tech to disadvantaged schools and communities. It may take a while to really balance out the entire company's makeup, but publishing hiring rates and overall figures make it clear how quickly Apple is moving there.",0.46194211814132086,0.5380578818586792,0.2008757285399214,424,4.8160377358490569,236,5.4364406779661021,0,2,"Apple, Tech",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

As of this week, Google is transforming into Alphabet, a vast holding company that will contain core products like Search and Android under the Google name, alongside newer ventures like Fiber and Loon. The shakeup has already been hailed as a way of keeping the company weird, or maintaining a startup structure within an increasingly large company — but there's another advantage to the setup that's been less discussed. While Alphabet gives the company's moonshots new opportunities to grow, it also nests them as distinct subsidiaries, each with its own liability, management, and  profit stream. It's a common setup among large conglomerates like Sony, General Electric, and HSBC, but this is the first time Google has taken advantage of the arrangement. ""It's a very clean structure, and it works."" In fact, from a corporate structure perspective, the biggest surprise is that Google hasn't split off more of its projects already. In the company's most recent annual report to the SEC, it listed only three subsidiaries: two general purpose tax shelters in Ireland and one international LLC in Delaware. Compare that with Disney, which is less than half the size of Google by market cap, and listed no less than 73 separate subsidiaries in its most recent report. Some of that is simple history: obviously Marvel is going to be separate from Pixar, which is going to be separate from Disney itself. But is it necessary for Walt Disney World to be separate from Walt Disney Parks & Resorts, which is itself separate from Euro Disney? Do we really need an entire LLP devoted entirely to Spider-Man merchandise? If you're worried about liability, the answer is yes. That bizarrely intricate subsidiary structure means that, if Disney World were abruptly destroyed by murderous animatronic robots, Euro Disney would be nicely shielded from the resulting legal fallout. By the same token, if Project Wing started wreaking havoc on the nation's air traffic control systems, the rest of the moonshot projects could continue unaffected. It's not likely to happen, but these are the nightmares that keep corporate lawyers awake at night, and nested subsidiaries are the product of those sleepless nights. The result won't change Google's tax bill much (R&D expenses are deductible under either structure), but the liability concerns are real, and many of the lawyers I spoke to were surprised that Google had kept the X projects so exposed for so long. ""You would have thought that each new business would have been set up as its own subsidiary, but apparently that was not the case,"" said Duane Morris' David Feldman, who has written on the advantages of corporate restructuring in the past. Feldman said he likes the simplicity of Alphabet, as an unusually direct way of getting the protection of subsidiaries. ""It's a very clean structure, and it works."" Those factors may ultimately prove secondary to the startup benefits I wrote about earlier this week, but they do put the restructuring in a different light. The restructuring will empower Google's moonshots, certainly, but it also brings it up to date on some of the tricks pioneered by the faceless conglomerates of the world. And while Google looks to emulate lean startups and agile VC firms, it's also taking cues from Disney and GE, and looking more and more like a corporate behemoth.",0.6171727021362532,0.3828272978637468,0.1790594439646829,560,5.0821428571428573,332,5.9487951807228914,0,0,"Google, Tech, Report",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The newest option from Dell — the Chromebook 13 — is a little bit of both. It's beautifully built, and it won't break the bank. The standard model of the new Dell Chromebook 13, which was announced today, starts at $399, boots in under 6 seconds, and offers around 12 hours of battery life. It has 2GB of RAM, 16GB of storage, and a 1.5 GHz Intel Celeron processor. Without question, the Dell Chromebook 13 is one of the most premium Chromebooks ever made outside of Google’s own Pixel, and it’s something you notice from the moment you set your hands down on the back-lit keyboard. Dell brought over the glass trackpad from its XPS line of notebooks, which is slick and clicks nicely. The palm rest is made of magnesium alloy, the back panel features a carbon fiber weave, and the bottom of the laptop is aluminum. Lots of other Chromebooks look like Chromebooks — in a bad way — but this looks like a high-end laptop.   The 13-inch, 1080p matte IPS display is better than just about every other Chromebook screen on the market (excluding again, the pricey Pixel). It's sharp, reproduces colors accurately, and doesn't look foggy like some cheap matte displays often do. It isn’t as tack sharp as the screen found on the Chromebook Pixel, but then again it won't run you $1,000.   At $399 and up, this new laptop is aimed at the business world, and Dell wants it to be the first Chromebook to be widely adopted by web-centric workers who are already committed to using Google’s services. And for those kinds of users, there is plenty to like, like a high-security VPN program that Dell worked with Google to integrate into the software, or a virtual workspace software so that workers can still remotely access Windows. But if you've been thinking about buying a Chromebook, this new option from Dell is one of the best you'll find on the market in the near future, regardless of whether you'll be using it for Excel or just clicking around YouTube. The Dell Chromebook 13 starts at $399, and can be configured in a number of ways with the price topping out at $899. Some of the standout upgrades along that price range are optional Intel core i3 or i5 processors, up to 8GB of memory, and a touchscreen version with a glossy Gorilla Glass display.

But until the vaccine is tested in an area where an Ebola risk actually exists, it’s efficacy against the disease will remain a mystery. The current outbreak has claimed the lives of over 22,000 people Since the beginning of the West African outbreak, Ebola has claimed the lives of over 22,000 people. There’s no cure for Ebola, but it can be controlled through routine hand-washing and by using gloves and other barriers to prevent contact with infectious bodily fluids. It doesn’t spread through the air; only direct contact with the body fluids of a person who is showing symptoms of Ebola will spread the disease. Still, the death toll from Ebola has been devastating, and researchers are actively searching for a way to protect people from becoming infected. In the study, researchers tested three different doses of the vaccine for safety and tolerability. They did so by giving a single dose to 60 healthy participants in Oxford, UK. Then, the researchers monitored the patients for four weeks. During that time, they measured the participants’ immunological responses to the vaccines and checked for negative reactions. The vaccine didn’t raise any safety concerns, and only two people developed fever in its aftermath. ""They showed that there’s a good immune response."" ""They showed that there’s a good immune response,"" says Kirsten Lyke, an Ebola vaccine researcher at The University of Maryland who didn’t participate in the study. It triggered the production of a high level of antibodies, she says, and ""it seems pretty safe."" The vaccine used in this study was made by isolating a chimpanzee cold virus that doesn’t cause illness in humans. Researchers deleted genetic material from the virus to prevent it from reproducing in humans after vaccination. Then, they introduced a gene from the Ebola virus into the cold virus. This change causes the virus to use a patient’s cells to synthesize an Ebola protein belonging to the Zaire strain, the strain currently raging in West Africa, upon vaccination. When that happens, the protein is recognized by the human immune system as something to combat, and the body responds by producing T cells and antibodies that researchers hope will be enough to fight the Ebola virus should exposure ever occur. This isn’t the only Ebola vaccine undergoing testing. There are several other vaccines being tested for safety at the moment, including a similar one that expresses two forms of Ebola proteins — one from the Zaire strain and one from the Sudan strain. ""This means that potentially protective vaccines could be available to health care workers in the field within clinical trials to assess vaccine efficacy"" in the near future, says Katie Ewer, an immunologist at The University of Oxford and a co-author of the study. ""Efficacy can only be tested in the context of exposure to the outbreak in West Africa."" Now that this trial is over, Ewer and her team hope to try to improve the immune responses they’ve seen by introducing a second vaccine made from a modified vaccinia Ankara virus — a virus that was used to make the smallpox vaccine — and using it as a booster dose. The results of that study should be published in the coming months, Ewer says. Of course, the most important step is to test the vaccine in an area where people are actually at risk for Ebola. ""Efficacy can only be tested in the context of exposure to the outbreak in West Africa,"" she says. Until that happens, all researchers can do is test vaccines for safety and compare the immunological responses seen in humans to those of vaccinated chimps exposed to Ebola. ""The next step is to ask 'does it actually protect against Ebola?'"" Lyke says. But ""at least humans are mounting good immune responses"" in the meantime.",0.41840660488342707,0.5815933951165729,0.8156485481235493,705,4.9900709219858159,339,6.1887905604719764,0,0,"Science, Report",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Researchers from the University of Rochester say they can make metals superhydrophobic (highly water-repellent) using powerful lasers to etch micro and nanoscale structures onto its surface. ""The material is so strongly water-repellent, the water actually gets bounced off,"" said Chunlei Guo, lead author of the study outlining the technique, in a statement. ""Then it lands on the surface again, gets bounced off again, and then it will just roll off from the surface."" Unlike chemical treatments, laser-etching can't be rubbed off Superhydrophobic surfaces have previously been created using chemicals (some sprays are even sold commercially), but this treatment doesn't last longer than a few years and is easily damaged. Guo says that his method is far more lasting as the laser etching is ""intrinsically part of the material surface"" and can't just be rubbed off. The structures mimic properties found in nature and work by ""propping up"" water droplets using microgrooves. This reduces the contact angle between the droplets and the surface, making it easier for them to roll away — similar to the difference between dropping a deflated and a pumped-up ball on a flat surface.  Potential applications include extra sanitary and efficient water pipes. (University of Rochester)  The unique properties of superhydrophobic surfaces could have all sorts of real-world benefits, making surfaces easier to clean (water droplets just pick up dust and roll away) and less corrosive. Guo says that one application would be in developing countries where water is scarce. ""In these regions, collecting rainwater is vital and using super-hydrophobic materials could increase the efficiency,"" he says. ""A second application could be creating latrines that are cleaner and healthier to use."" It took an hour to create a 1-inch by 1-inch sample However, using lasers to create superhydrophobic surfaces could face some serious hurdles. It took Guo and his team an hour to treat a 1 inch by 1 inch metal sample, and the laser they used reaches an energy draw ""equivalent to ... the entire power grid of North America"" at its peak. (The reason this doesn't crash the grid is that it uses extremely short femtosecond laser pulses — each lasting about one-quadrillionth of a second.) Still, the potential benefits certainly merit further research. Guo points out that the etching process can also be used to make surfaces absorb more light, potentially resulting in more efficient solar panels that are also self-cleaning.

A Nobel prize winner and a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, Townes thought up the idea for the maser, the predecessor to the laser, helping to alter the course of technology, society, and science fiction. Townes died in Oakland and spent much of his life at Berkeley, but it was on a park bench in Washington, DC, where he had a revelation that led to the development of the laser. The year was 1951, and the physicist was in the capital to meet with a Navy committee, in hopes of finding ways to enhance communications technology using microwaves. Townes had been hitting his head against the problem without success, when, seated upon the bench, a new approach came to mind ""like a sudden revelation."" Townes thought up the predecessor to the laser on a park bench The physicist declined to share his new idea, which he'd written on a scrap of paper in his DC hotel room, with the Navy committee. Instead, he went back to Columbia University and began building a device he called a ""maser,"" the acronym standing for ""microwave amplification by stimulated emission of radiation."" Townes said that a number of his peers, including eminent physicist Niels Bohr, had originally discounted his theory, arguing that it violated Heisenberg's uncertainty principle — but the machine he built worked. He won the Nobel prize in Physics in 1964 Six years later, in 1957, Townes began to look into the creation of a new version of the maser, which used infrared light rather than microwaves. Townes first called the concept an ""optical maser."" The term ""laser,"" standing for ""light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation,"" came later, first published in a paper by graduate student Gordon Gould in 1959. The first laser was built in 1960 by Theodore H. Maiman, as research teams across the country scrambled to make the first working device. Four years later, the laser's importance was already recognized at the highest scientific level — Townes shared the 1964 Nobel prize in Physics with Nicolay Gennadiyevich Basov and Aleksandr Mikhailovich Prokhorov, two Soviet scientists who had been researching similar technology at the same time. Townes' park bench revelation has been immensely important for the advancement of medicine, industry, and our daily lives — lasers are still used to read everything from Blu-Rays to barcodes.

Wherever you stand on the I'm-Barely-Snowed-In-And-Kinda-Annoyed scale, that our preparedness blitz — the alerts, the stockpiling, the breathless headlines — came to face a disappointing reality exposes a huge problem with how we think about weather. As a people, we’re really bad at handling the inherent doubt in weather science. Weather science is hard Let's take a deep breath and say a simple truth together: Weather science is hard. When it comes to the weather, meteorologists work with a multitude of models — ones that often conflict — to determine with varying degrees of accuracy how dynamic weather patterns will behave days in advance. In short, meteorology is about predicting a region's future, which should give you an immediate sense of how difficult the task is. That being said, science is judged by progress, and meteorology is getting better all the time. As Nate Silver wrote for The New York Times in 2012: But watching the local news is not the best way to assess the growing accuracy of forecasting (more on this later). It’s better to take the long view. In 1972, the service’s high-temperature forecast missed by an average of six degrees when made three days in advance. Now it’s down to three degrees. More stunning, in 1940, the chance of an American being killed by lightning was about 1 in 400,000. Today it’s 1 in 11 million. This is partly because of changes in living patterns (more of our work is done indoors), but it’s also because better weather forecasts have helped us prepare. The trouble comes with conveying doubt. Culturally, we hate doubt, especially when it concerns something as fundamental as what the weather is like outside. Weather apps lend a sense of certainty to what's uncertain on the other side of our windows. But applying language that implies certainty to uncertain science can produce disastrous results. That's when weather stops being just science and starts becoming a political and media issue. For many, meteorologists are authority figures; we imbue a certain level of trust in their predictions. Unfortunately, meteorologists are often lousy at conveying doubt; even when they do, we often don't appreciate it. That's why we can call them ""Weather Gods"" with straight faces when they get things right. It's also why we blame them when their predictions don't work out. Calling an approaching storm ""historic"" can seem like fear-mongering when the storm isn't as strong as promised. But the abundance of caution meteorologists use around weather is meant to avoid human deaths. Lawmakers are forced to make decisions in the public's interest based on these predictions. For instance, when a blizzard hit New York City in 2010, dropping 18 to 24 inches of snow, Mayor Bloomberg whiffed in his response (perhaps in part because he was on vacation in Bermuda when he should have been planning for the storm). As a result, plows were unable to clear many streets, ambulances couldn't respond to 911 calls, and many travelers were stranded. DeBlasio, the city's public advocate at the time, chided Bloomberg for failing to declare a snow emergency. Decisions to ban all travel have a material effect on the electorate, and do double duty in showing concern for human life and helping protect said politician's viability. It's no mistake now DeBlasio is mayor, he chose to approach this week's storm with caution, claims that he was building a nanny state in the process be damned. In the aftermath, though, we have this: I share your annoyance. MT @MattNelko: hope you ask serious questions of our officials as to why they placed entire city under house arrest.  And let's not forget the role of the press: doubt doesn't attract audiences. So instead, the bulk of coverage around the storm focused on the worst-case scenario. We saw a glut of stories about what to do during the storm, blizzard explainers, so on and so forth, all to the point that BuzzFeed had to chide the internet for the freakout. BuzzFeed! So it's no wonder New Yorkers are pissed off, either because we're losing money, or because we're disappointed New York City doesn't look like that scene from The Day After Tomorrow. Meanwhile, Boston is getting buried essentially as predicted. This is a systemic, cultural issue But this isn't just one storm, really. What we're seeing here is a systemic, cultural issue: how much we hate doubt. Weather science doesn't trade in certainties, no matter how much we want it to. Workable facts are necessary to enact policy and keep people informed. An array of possible outcomes means, essentially, that the media and politicians will focus on one outcome — which can set us up for disappointment. There might be a fix, though. We should work on how we talk about predictions and the models we use to understand weather. If that happens, we might still get an unnecessary snow day here and there, but we can stop being mad about it. Because until weather science gets better, we're still — sometimes — going to get it wrong.

Since the Genetic Information Nondiscrmination Act (GINA) was signed into law in 2008, very few GINA-related charges have been made. That doesn’t mean that Americans aren’t worried that this sort of discrimination might arise in their own lives, however, according to a perspective piece published yesterday in the New England Journal of Medicine. GINA was signed into law almost seven years ago to prevent health insurance companies and employers from discriminating against individuals based on family history of illness or results from genetic testing. For example, the law prevents an employer from firing an employee because they have a family history of cancer. But GINA hasn’t been invoked very often since 2008. In 2013, for instance, the US only had 333 GINA-related charges of employment discrimination, compared with 90,000 charges relating to other areas of discrimination. Moreover, most of those charges were added following an investigation relating to an Americans with Disabilities Act claim. 333 GINA-related charges of employment discrimination in 2013 ""GINA has sent a powerful message throughout society that we won’t tolerate genetic discrimination,"" says Robert Green, a geneticist at Brigham and Women's Hospital and co-author of the perspective piece. ""And I’m guessing that these companies realize that they might get tremendous public push-back if they were to do this."" But the small number of charges may also be a sign that Americans aren’t aware that GINA exists. An online survey of 1,479 individuals performed in 2014 by Green and his colleagues showed that 79 percent of respondents didn’t know what GINA was or what protection it offered. And people who did know about GINA didn’t fully comprehend it. What’s even more striking, however, is that 30 percent of participants said that they became more worried about genetic discrimination after reading about GINA. ""We noticed how present in the minds of our participants concerns about genetic discrimination were — particularly by employers and insurance,"" Green says. ""GINA was attempting to reassure the public."" This fear is a big problem for researchers because some people refuse to participate in studies as a result, Green says. In order to implement genetic data in a research project, participants have to be willing to tolerate genetic information being included in their medical records and discussed with their doctors. This practice comes with an ""omnipresent concern about genetic discrimination,"" Green says. And yet, this sort of fear is exactly what GINA was trying to avoid in the first place. ""What was fascinating to me was that the very language of GINA was attempting to reassure the public, so that they could take advantage of the fruits of genomic research,"" Green says. The fact that GINA doesn’t cover genetic discrimination relating to life insurance, long-term care insurance or disability insurance may be the reason for continued fear in the US. Yet Green says that he hasn’t seen many insurance companies request genetic test results. ""I’m not aware of any recent incidents were anybody has been denied insurance on the basis of genetic testing,"" he says. This could still happen, of course. A 2010 study found that people who learn that they have a higher than average risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease are more likely to buy long-term care insurance. Once insurance companies clue into this, they may start increasing their long-term care insurance prices based on genetic risk factors — a change that would be perfectly legal under GINA. As genetic medicine becomes the norm, the term ""genetic discrimination"" may become obsolete  That is one possible future, Green says. But even that might not last very long. Genomic science is moving quickly, and it’s bound to become more present in our lives. Eventually it may help us personalize medicine and tailor our diets and exercise regimens. Once that happens, the term ""genetic discrimination"" may become obsolete, the researchers write — genetic-based medicine will simply become all medicine, and any form of medical discrimination will be outlawed by extension. In the meantime, however, researchers and government officials should try to find a way to overcome the public's fears. ""We’ve had so many stories and narratives of people losing health insurance that this is sort of an existential concern that permeates our society now,"" Green says. If we want people to take full advantage of the medical knowledge we’ve gained recently, we have to overcome the ""absolute fear of genetic discrimination,"" he says.

It's in this time capsule of human evolution that researchers say they've found a partial skull that serves as a ""connecting link"" between ancient and modern humans — ""the first direct fossil evidence that modern humans inhabited the Levantine corridor"" about 55,000 years ago. The origin story of Homo sapiens is told piecewise through archaeological finds and scientific analysis, all of which amounts to us using that data to try and connect the dots. At a point in that timeline, between 40,000 and 60,000 years ago, anatomically modern humans (AMH) from Africa expanded across Europe and Asia. Until now, however, fossil evidence has been scarce. ""It's an important puzzle in the big story of human evolution"" ""It's an important puzzle in the big story of human evolution,"" says Israel Hershkovitz, the Professor in the Department of Anatomy and Anthropology, Sackler Faculty of Medicine at Tel Aviv University, who's leading up the excavation team that discovered this skull fragment dubbed ""Manot 1."" The findings, published this week by Nature, provides insight into that migration. Detailed analysis of the skull fragment's physical characteristics (e.g. shape and form) link it to both African and European fossils. For example, it shares a number of similarities to the Mladeč 1 skull, which was found in a cave within Czech Republic's borders and is believed to be around 35,000 years old. Manot 1's age has been estimated at 55,000 years using uranium-thorium dating. Excavation of the Manot cave first began in 2010, after it was found by accident — or more accurately, by a bulldozer that was making a trench for a nearby village's sewer line and wound up opening the cave's proverbial chimney. ""I was there when the cave was found... We went down 25 meters [82 feet], and we realized this was a prehistoric cave — a beautiful, beautiful cave,"" says Hershkovitz.  ""The fascinating thing about Manot site is that once it was left by prehistoric man, nobody ever entered the cave. It's as if somebody left his house and never came back, and after 30- or 40-thousand years, someone else is opening the door and seeing everything as it were more than 30-thousand years ago.""  Photo Credit: Israel Hershkovitz, Ofer Marder & Omry Barzilai This accidental find may upend what's known as the assimilation model, or partial replacement model. According to this model, modern humans originated from Africa but then evolved through interbreeding with European Neanderthals. It's estimated that human DNA today has between 2 and 4 percent Neanderthal genes, so it's not a question of if interbreeding occurred, but when and where. The Manot skull shares some physical characteristics with Neanderthals and could suggest this interbreeding happened in the Levantine corridor instead of Europe. Without genetic testing, however, the morphological comparisons are just speculative. Hershkovitz does note, however, that we can now place the Manot cave occupants within 40 kilometers of areas where Neanderthals were known to exist around the same time. ""We are suggesting we don't need the assimilation model to explain the morphology of the Upper Paleolithic populations in Europe because they look very much like Manot skull."" ""We hope to find more human remains."" Hershkovitz and his team plan to keep working at the site at least until 2020 (""it all depends on budget,"" he notes), and there's a strong chance we'll learn even more about the origin of our species. ""Manot cave is one of the largest prehistoric caves ever found in the world — not just in Israel,"" he said. ""It's not a rock shelter; it's a real cave with a huge central chamber and many side chambers, occupied for thousands of years. We just start excavating it, and we've just scratched the upper archaeological layer."" ""The potential is great,"" he said.

According to Bloomberg, the partnership is expected to last multiple years and will have Google analyzing data from people with the disease, which currently has no cure. The progression of MS can vary dramatically between patients, with some only experiencing temporary numbness and others experiencing paralysis. Google's interest lies in determining what leads to one progression over the other. Biogen Idec makes drugs that treat MS, and it's hoping to use the research to develop new treatments or determine which patients should receive which drugs.  Google X has been doing more and more with health care Though Google hasn't traditionally been involved with the health care world, Google X began taking steps in that direction last year. About a year ago, it unveiled work on a ""smart"" contact lens that can measure glucose levels to help people with diabetes, which Bloomberg reports has since been licensed out to the health care company Novartis. Over the summer, the lab began trying to collect enough medical data to determine what the perfectly healthy human looks like. Then in September, Google bought the company behind an electronic utensil that intelligently compensates for Parkinson's tremors and folded its team into Google X. Google X tells Bloomberg that it has no intention of becoming a pharmaceutical company, but there is interest in the lab becoming an important research partner to companies that are going after tough goals and want to do so with new approaches. Of course, that's still only part of what Google X does: the lab is also where Google's self-driving cars are built and where its internet hotspot balloons are being made.

Instead of spinning ""thick"" silk threads (in this case, thick means several micrometers), the garden center spider can spin tiny nano-scale threads that are also extremely sticky. This is particularly useful when catching prey, but until recently researchers didn't now how the spider managed to make such sticky silk. Now, researchers say they've figured it out: the garden center spider's silk is sticky because the spider combs and pulls at the tiny threads to charge the fibers. In other words, this spider appears to have figured out how electrostatic interactions work. Combs out the filaments using special hairs on its hind legs In the study, published today in Biology Letters, researchers used three different kinds of microscopy techniques to study organs that produce silk in Uloborus plumipes, the garden center spider. They also filmed the spider's spinning action to see how the organs work. They found that this species has extremely small silk glands that allow it to spin ultra-fine threads. The raw material that the spider uses to make its silk is therefore funneled through very long and narrow ducts. Moreover, the silk is only formed once it goes through the garden center spider's uniquely shaped spigots, tiny structures that make up the spider's spinnerets. But what really caught the researchers' attention is when they realized that the spider was combing out the filaments released by the spigots onto larger core fibers using special hairs on its hind legs. These combing and pulling movements are the reason the silk adheres to the spider's prey so easily: they charge the fibers, causing them bunch up into tiny, sticky wool-like ""puffs.""               The finding could lead to new kinds of polymer-processing technologies, the researchers say. It might even help scientists come up with their own version of the super sticky nano-scale threads.

Baby octopuses were climbing up their lines, seemingly struggling to get out of the deep. ""In 30 years of crabbing, I'd never seen anything like it before,"" a fisherman told the Los Angeles Times. ""It's spooky, this dead-zone thing."" The crabs had suffocated, caught by a sudden influx of low-oxygen water. The dead zone has reappeared every year since, expanding to cover an area the size of Rhode Island in 2006. Researchers have long suspected dead zones like Oregon’s are linked to climate change. Something in the system of ocean currents and wind patterns had shifted, creating a deadly new normal, and it had happened suddenly. A study out today in PLOS One gives an idea of just how widespread — and how sudden — these shifts can be. Researchers reconstructed the state of seawater as the ice sheets melted roughly 10,000-17,000 years ago, a period of climate change with parallels to our own, by using ocean sediment taken from locations between Chile and the Gulf of Alaska. The scientists found evidence of extreme oxygen loss all along the Pacific coast. More alarming, they found that it happened fast — in some cases, in less than 100 years. ""We were definitely struck by the rate, by how fast these changes happen,"" says Sarah Moffitt, a researcher at the UC Davis Bodega Marine Laboratory and lead author of the paper. Low-oxygen zones occur naturally in certain parts of the ocean, often some of the most productive for fisheries, as a side effect of nutrient-rich water coming to the surface. In Oregon, for instance, summer winds push warm, oxygen-rich surface water offshore, and cold, fertile, but oxygen-starved water cycles up from the deep to take its place. It’s a process called upwelling, and like rotating compost, it brings a wealth of nutrients to the surface; those nutrients feed phytoplankton, which in turn feed fish and crabs. When the phytoplankton die, they sink and decay, creating areas of low oxygen farther down in the water column. But in recent years, these low-oxygen zones have been getting bigger, more intense, and creeping closer to shore. ""It’s a natural feature of upwelling zones,"" Moffitt says. ""But this investigation showed that it’s extremely responsive to abrupt climate change. The capacity for these zones to expand vertically and geographically is very extreme.""   The relationship between climate change and dead zones is complex. When seawater gets warmer, it holds less dissolved oxygen. Layers of ocean water also become more stratified, and it gets harder for oxygen-rich surface layers to mix with deeper water. Warming at the poles affects the formation of deepwater currents that move water around the Pacific. Changing wind patterns on land affect how often upwelling occurs. Though the exact mechanism driving dead zone expansion is unclear, studies show that it’s happening and will likely increase. One model predicts a 50 percent increase in low-oxygen water by the end of the century. As the zones spread, they reduce the number of habitats for many of the sea creatures we eat. The disconcerting thing about Moffitt’s study is that it shows how quickly these changes can happen. Most policy discussions about climate change are conducted in terms of estimates and averages — 3 feet of sea level rise, 170 percent increase in ocean acidity — but what we’re dealing with are complex interlocking systems with tipping points and feedback loops we barely understand. ""It’s not just about temperature,"" says Moffitt. ""It’s about disrupting fundamental earth processes that we as humans have understood to be very stable. They’re not stable. These systems have the capacity to be very unstable when you poke climate system with a sharp stick.""",0.48547498964180813,0.5145250103581919,0.824441841869858,640,5.0921874999999996,384,6.0625,0,5,"Science, Report",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Or maybe nobody knows what Reddit is about. Or maybe nobody knows what free speech is about. Reddit's management doesn't seem sure, and it's threatening to tear the site apart. Yesterday, Reddit's incoming CEO and original co-founder Steve Huffman said he'd be holding a Q&A session over the site's content policy. Reddit is famously expansive in what it allows, but it's taken a very mild stand against harassment in the past months, which has created a firestorm over whether or not Reddit is truly in favor of free speech. Huffman answered the central question bluntly in his announcement. ""Neither Alexis nor I created Reddit to be a bastion of free speech, but rather as a place where open and honest discussion can happen,"" he wrote. To some extent, this should be completely obvious — just look at Reddit's taboo against revealing non-protected personal information, which is absolutely legal. But it also doesn't quite square with how the site has portrayed itself in the past few years. So has Reddit historically been about free speech? Yes, and no. July 2015: ""If there was anything racist, sexist, or homophobic I'd ban it right away."" In the wake of Ellen Pao's firing, former CEO Yishan Wong agrees that Reddit wasn't started as a ""bastion of free speech,"" even if it would get closer to one over the years. Specifically, he recalls asking Huffman for advice when surreptitious ""creepshots"" of women were coming under fire. The very interesting thing he wrote back was ""back when I was running things, if there was anything racist, sexist, or homophobic I'd ban it right away. I don't think there's a place for such things on Reddit. Of course, now that Reddit is much bigger, I understand if maybe things are different."" [...] The free speech policy was something I formalized because it seemed like the wiser course at the time. It's worth stating that in that era, we were talking about whether it was ok for people to post creepy pictures of women taken legally in public. That's shitty, but it's a far cry from the extremes of hate that some parts of the site host today. Wong says he didn't anticipate how far the needle would shift over the years: ""Reddit has become a lot bigger — yes, a lot better — AND a lot worse. I have to take responsibility."" June 2015: ""It's not our site's goal to be a completely free-speech platform."" After banning five subreddits for harassment, interim CEO Ellen Pao justifies her plan on, among other platforms, NPR. Her statement sounds a lot like Huffman's. Somebody expressing ideas that aren't consistent with everybody's views is something that we encourage. There are certain posts that do make people feel unsafe, that people feel threatened or they feel that their family or friends or people near them are going to be unsafe, and those are the specific things that we are focused on today. It's not our site's goal to be a completely free speech platform. We want to be a safe platform and we want to be a platform that also protects privacy at the same time. The decision isn't popular on Reddit, and Pao steps down a month later, after unrelated protests about the firing of a Reddit employee. May 2015: ""Reddit should be a place where anyone can pull up their soapbox and speak their mind ... but right now Redditors are telling us they sometimes encounter users who use the system to harass them."" Defending a newly instituted anti-harassment policy, co-founder Alexis Ohanian gives Redditors a tidbit of information about the site's founding: it was inspired by London public forum Speakers' Corner. He promotes an open community, but one that people can use without feeling unsafe. Reddit should be a place where anyone can pull up their soapbox and speak their mind, or have a discussion and maybe learn something new and even challenging or uncomfortable, but right now Redditors are telling us they sometimes encounter users who use the system to harass them and that's a problem. This is predictably mocked by Redditors: ""The internet has never been a 'nice and friendly' place,"" sneers the top-rated reply. September 2014: ""We uphold the ideal of free speech on Reddit as much as possible."" After a week of criticism, Reddit shuts down ""The Fappening,"" a subreddit dedicated to spreading and organizing leaked nude pictures of celebrities like Jennifer Lawrence. CEO Yishan Wong promises that this won't become a regular occurrence, saying that Reddit is ""the government of a new type of community"" and making a strident defense of the ability to post just about anything. We uphold the ideal of free speech on reddit as much as possible not because we are legally bound to, but because we believe that you — the user — has the right to choose between right and wrong, good and evil, and that it is your responsibility to do so. When you know something is right, you should choose to do it. But as much as possible, we will not force you to do it. October 2012: ""We stand for free speech."" Gawker journalist Adrian Chen exposes the real name of Violentacrez, the man behind some of Reddit's creepiest boards. Large parts of Reddit respond by blacklisting all Gawker links, arguing that Chen has violated Reddit's ""no personal information"" rule. In a memo leaked by Gawker, Yishan Wong tells staff that ""this ban on links from the Gawker network is not making Reddit look so good."" We stand for free speech. This means we are not going to ban distasteful subreddits. We will not ban legal content even if we find it odious or if we personally condemn it. Not because that's the law in the United States — because as many people have pointed out, privately-owned forums are under no obligation to uphold it — but because we believe in that ideal independently, and that's what we want to promote on our platform. We are clarifying that now because in the past it wasn't clear, and (to be honest) in the past we were not completely independent and there were other pressures acting on Reddit. Now it's just Reddit, and we serve the community, we serve the ideals of free speech, and we hope to ultimately be a universal platform for human discourse. February 2012: ""I would love to imagine that Common Sense would have been a self-post on Reddit, by Thomas Paine."" Ohanian talks to Forbes about the future of politics and Reddit's recent blackout protest against SOPA — it's widely credited with helping kill the widely loathed anti-piracy bill. He's asked what the Founding Fathers would think about his site. ""A bastion of free speech on the World Wide Web? I bet they would like it,"" he replies. It's the digital form of political pamphlets. ""Yes, with much wider distribution and without the inky fingers,"" he says. ""I would love to imagine that Common Sense would have been a self-post on Reddit, by Thomas Paine, or actually a Redditor named T_Paine."" July 2011: ""We're a free speech site with very few exceptions."" Reddit general manager Erik Martin appears on Ask Me Anything. ""What do you think about subreddits such as r/jailbait and r/picsofdeadkids?"" a user asks. Martin says he finds them ""gross"" and imagines 98 percent of Reddit might agree, but questions where you'd draw the line with something like ""Pics of Dead Kids."" What if the name of the subreddit was /r/autopsyphotos or /r/doyoureallywanttogointocriminalforensics and they were sincere in their discussion of these images? Would some of that 98 percent now be ok with it? I would bet at least some would. What if it wasn't kids but adults? Or historical autopsy photos only? The point is I don't want to be the one making those decisions for anyone but myself, and it's not the business Reddit is in. We're a free speech site with very few exceptions (mostly personal info) and having to stomach occasional troll reddit like picsofdeadkids or morally questionable reddits like jailbait are part of the price of free speech on a site like this. May 2011: ""Posting personal information is the internet version of vandalism."" As Reddit grows, the site's administrators realize that its user base can descend on random individuals like a swarm of angry bees. This can be perfectly legal speech, but community manager Kristine Fasnacht says that the site is cracking down hard on posting information that could lead to harassment. This will remain one of Reddit's few sacrosanct rules in the coming years. DO NOT POST USERS' PERSONAL INFORMATION. EVER. NO phone numbers, NO email addresses, NO real names, NO blood types, NO SSN's, NO facebook pics or profiles, NO mothers' maiden names, NOTHING. This is a ban-on-sight offense, and lately we have banned multiple users for posting personal info. [...] Posting personal information is the Internet version of vandalism and abuse and will not be tolerated. March 2008: ""We're just taking ourselves out of the equation."" Reddit starts letting people create their own subreddits. That's right — for three years, Reddit handled all its own community creation, with input from users. Ohanian outlines new classes of public, ""restricted,"" and private groups, which are at that point just called ""reddits."" We learned a long time ago that there are things you all as a community can do that we — as a team of five — couldn't possibly do. Creating different verticals for reddit is just one more area where we know our community can do a better job identifying and growing successful reddits. Our first new community, programming.reddit was created because users explicitly told us they wanted a place for users interested in programming to share links and discussion. Now we're just taking ourselves out of the equation. December 2005: ""Comments!"" Reddit didn't launch with a commenting system, either — one of the key elements of its ""free speech"" platform. These were opened up a few months after launch, with a short announcement post by Huffman. We added a commenting system today for your enjoyment. The comments are votable and can be sorted just as all the other links on Reddit. June 2005: The beginning Reddit was founded in June 2005, and Huffman posted its first substantive blog update in October. And the first order of business wasn't community or free speech so much as figuring out how to be the best aggregation site on the web. We'd like to make [it] easier to share links with other users on Reddit, as well as with friends who are not members. We're also working to make it easier to avoid submitting duplicate stories. Sometimes Reddit is a bastion of free speech, sometimes it isn't, and sometimes it doesn't seem to matter. That's what makes this debate so tricky. If there's no ""original"" version to rely on, the community will have to decide what Reddit should be, not just figure out how to return it to an earlier, unsullied state. And it will have to do it while trying to become a real, profitable business — not just a tiny experiment.",0.6381294199166839,0.3618705800833161,0.22790062645643608,1872,4.8547008547008543,807,6.3308550185873607,0,0,"Culture, Web, Report",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

On a sunny day last week, Shaun McBride (known on Snapchat as Shonduras) went to the supermarket. His hundreds of thousands of followers were alerted to the expedition through a Snapchat showing McBride holding a hastily drawn watermelon and a box of Cap'n Crunch. ""What's up, Snapchatters? Welcome to grocery shopping with Shonduras!"" he said in the opening salvo. ""You might be like, ‘Grocery shopping's boring!’ But that's because you've never been with Shonduras!"" Regular followers would already know about McBride's ongoing obsession with sugary cereal, so it was no surprise he headed straight for the cereal aisle, specifically the Crunch Berries. ""If you don't get these then you are blowing it,"" McBride said. ""That's right, Cap'n Crunch Berry Delights are a real thing."" Holding up a box of the Berries, he began to shake uncontrollably. Followers then saw McBride sucked into the box, disappearing in a flash of light. In the following scene, he dropped from the ceiling into Taco Bell's headquarters, where the branding team was engaged in a deep brainstorming session. McBride's appearance inspired the team to invent the deep-fried Cap'n Crunch Berry Delight, segueing into a tour of Taco Bell’s official test kitchen. ""That's right, Cap'n Crunch Berry Delights are a real thing,"" McBride explained. ""They come out tomorrow, and I'm going to try to make the first batch."" Followers who wanted to watch McBride make the Delights himself could switch over to the Taco Bell account, where they could continue the rest of the story. This is a new kind of ad campaign, one that has become increasingly popular on Snapchat. It works by the same basic logic as traditional ads: Shonduras has an audience, just like Time magazine or The Today Show, and Taco Bell wants to tell that audience about its new dessert. Since it's a valuable audience, they're willing to pay for the privilege, often as much as $100,000 for an involved story like this one. At the same time, there’s rarely a clear disclosure up front that what followers are seeing is an ad, and none of the traditional restrictions on advertising apply. It’s a no-man’s-land of partnerships, but for brands and influencers alike, it’s proven too lucrative to pass up.  Shonduras isn’t the only Snapchatter making money off his account. When Universal wanted to promote its cyberbullying horror movie Unfriended earlier this year, they brought on Brittany Furlan, who ran a series on her Vine and Snapchat accounts. Another successful Vine star named Jerome Jarre made waves by moving entirely to Snapchat. This year, Pepsi flew him to Colombia to build homes from two-liter soda bottles, and L’Oreal Paris brought his mother to the red carpet at Cannes. In each case, brand names were mentioned prominently, but formal disclosure was haphazard at best. It’s easy to see why McBride has become one of Snapchat's most appealing stars for advertisers. A 28-year-old Utah native, he's naturally cheerful, talking to the audience like friends and often asking them to interact with his stories as if they’re there with him. Even simple snaps generate a huge response, and McBride typically spends a full hour just sorting through replies. ""People just want to be doing what I'm doing and interact with me,"" McBride says. ""It's crazy that that happens, and it's super valuable from a brand perspective."" McBride says his audience is in the hundreds of thousands, well short of the muti-millions you'd get from popular YouTube or Vine accounts, but he's been able to draw in major sponsors thanks to his close bond with followers. He doesn’t know exactly who his followers are, but he suspects they skew young based on the people that reply. His snaps also seem likely to attract a younger crowd, focused on skating tricks, eating huge bowls of cereal, and playing pranks on friends at the airport. It’s a valuable demographic, and alongside Taco Bell, McBride has done stories with Red Bull, Disney, and Unicef, and in April, he partnered with American Idol for his first appearance on national television. Advertisers see Shonduras as a way to form a more direct connection with consumers. ""As a society, we've kind of learned to tune out advertisements on TV,"" McBride says. ""With Snapchat, we're not used to it. When you advertise on Snapchat, if you do it in a fun and creative way that adds value; they don't see it as an annoying ad. They actually enjoy it."" ""As a society, we've kind of learned to tune out advertisements on TV.... With Snapchat, we're not used to it."" Snapchat the company wasn't involved in Shonduras' partnership with Taco Bell, and while it's recently backed away from promoting brand stories directly, the company has taken a hands-off approach to independent partnerships. That has left McBride and Taco Bell to work out a deal on their own, with no clear best practices to abide by. McBride does put limits on the brands he'll work with, but they’re mostly personal. A practicing Mormon, he won't endorse alcoholic drinks, and tries to work with products he personally uses. ""I'm not going to do advertisements that I don't believe in,"" McBride says. ""I legitimately like Taco Bell. I'll work with them. I legitimately love cereal so I'll work with Honey Nut Cheerios. I love Samsung phones over iPhones, so I'll work with Samsung. I just try to keep it real."" While some form of sponsored content can be found on every social network, Snapchat presents a unique challenge for disclosing when a series has been paid for. ""Snapchat in particular is pretty unusual because it's all visual,"" says David Berkowitz, the chief marketing officer at digital agency MRY. ""It really does become much more of a decision between the influencer and the brand."" For most social channels, the popular answer is to drop ""#ad"" or ""#spon"" hashtag into the post description. You might not always notice it, but if you're wondering whether a pair of shoes was comped or paid for, you'll know where to find the answer. But Snapchat doesn't include any space for those hashtags, leaving marketers in an awkward place. ""It's hard to be too cautious if you're the marketer,"" Berkowitz says, ""especially because marketers have been fined for going too far."" In 2014, the FTC formally investigated a Cole Haan Pinterest campaign that asked users to re-pin Cole Haan posts in exchange for a chance at a $1,000 prize. The FTC concluded that the contest was fundamentally deceptive, and while it declined to press the matter in court, the letter signaled serious consequences for future campaigns that follow a similar path. As a result, marketers frequently point to the case as a cautionary tale. Snapchat’s self-destructing nature makes it hard for regulators to keep up But Snapchat’s self-destructing nature makes it hard for regulators to keep up. Many of the FTC's targets come from external referrals, whether from consumer complaints, congressional correspondence or outside advocacy groups. But if a video disappears as soon as you watch it, it can’t be sent to regulators, and recording and hosting a Snapchat Story is still out of reach for most consumers. Advertisers on broadcast channels face even stronger restrictions, spurred by concerned parent groups, but there’s no equivalent for social media, and the ephemeral nature of Snapchat means there’s little concerned parents can point to. Then there's the simple fact of how quickly these platforms are changing. The FTC's most recent paper on social media partnerships was published in March 2013, a full seven months before Snapchat launched the Stories feature used by Shonduras and Taco Bell. In June, the FTC updated its endorsement FAQ to require more explicit disclosures any time money changes hands, particularly on social platforms. Mary Engle, head of the FTC's advertising practices division, told The Verge that under the new guidelines, any video disclosures need to happen within the video frame, since the description and other metadata may not be visible when the video is embedded. For the disclosure to be effective, Engle says, ""it has to be made in the advertising medium itself."" In cases like Snapchat, where there's no second space, that could force marketers to choose between a prominent disclosure or no partnership at all. ""If it's not possible to make the disclosure on a platform for whatever reason then that platform should not be used for that advertisement,"" Engle says. Still, McBride worries that too much disclosure could ruin his connection to the audience. ""I like how it is right now, and I dislike that when you post on Instagram you have to put #ad,"" McBride says. ""It kind of takes away from the vibe."" It's unclear where that leaves him with regulators, but McBride says he doesn't think his followers will be confused. ""When you watch the Taco Bell Story, you know I'm working with Taco Bell. I'm not trying to hide that."" 12:28pm ET: Updated to clarify the typical sources of FTC referrals and more accurately distinguish the agency's endorsement guides from its FAQ.

Over the course of its 110-year history, the Rolls-Royce name has come to define what luxury means, both in the world of automobiles and beyond. If you haven't already, go and read my full report on how the recently resurrected Rolls-Royce is carrying on its fine tradition and legacy, and then come back here for all the eye candy from my tour of the factory floor. There are plenty of fun factoids scattered throughout as well, such as how the Starlight Headliner is made (and what it actually is) plus the reasons why Rolls-Royce has an anechoic test chamber and refuses to use anything other than Scandinavian bull hides for its leather upholstery.  Last year, this 91-year-old car completed the Rolls-Royce Centenary Alpine Trial — an 1,820-mile endurance test through inhospitable mountain terrain — and today it stands parked next to the company’s reception. It has a valid MOT sticker, meaning it’s still roadworthy and can be driven off at any time. It’s a piece of concrete evidence that Rolls-Royce can always point to when asserting its reputation for quality and excellence. One customer really liked this eagle image, so he had it embroidered into the headrests of his car. Because it couldn’t use the Rolls-Royce name until 2003 at the earliest, the 1998 BMW-owned company christened its first project the Roger Rabbit. The first hint of what the eventual Phantom would look like was provided by this cute “close coupled drophead gravity racer” in 2001. It finished fifth in its class and won the prize for best design. Sat just behind the reception area are all the cars of Rolls-Royce’s recent history, headlined by the grandiose motorized carriage that is the Phantom. The Pantheon grille is almost as iconic as the Spirit of Ecstasy ornament perched above it. These tree-like support structures are a recurring element in the design of the 7-acre Goodwood facility that Rolls-Royce calls home. Complemented by the circular skylight, they are a visually striking way to introduce yet more light into an already airy and open space. Instead of a conveyor belt, cars are transported around on these yellow trolleys, building up gradually as they pass through each assembly team’s area. The attendees of Rolls-Royce’s PR1DE+ Strategy management conference signalled their commitment to the company by signing their names on this commemorative hood. The body shells are manufactured in the Bavarian town of Dingolfing and shipped in for surface finishing and final assembly in the UK. You can literally have any color you like. This is just a small selection of the ones Rolls-Royce has matched to its customers’ specifications. Each has a custom name, such as the Debora Pink that was matched to the lipstick framed in the middle of the display. In spite of all of this variety, 80 percent of Rolls-Royce orders ask for a classic black, white, or silver paintjob. Robots are used to apply the base coat of paint on each Rolls-Royce body, but most of the spraying, finishing, polishing, and waxing is done manually. Here’s an example of the dashing outfits that Rolls-Royce’s workers wear while spiffing up the latest luxury car. Once they are polished to a fine sheen, the car shells make their way to the assembly line where mechanics start attaching the extra components to their steel-and-aluminum structures. The cars begin their tour through the factory as little more than a metal skeleton. Supplies are queued up on each side of the assembly line, anticipating the next cars in line with suitably painted parts. Like in an Amazon warehouse, each worker receives a list of necessary parts and collects them from Rolls-Royce’s “supermarket” area. Rolls-Royce uses a just-in-time system that makes sure parts and tools are in place as they are needed. That requires constant motion throughout the assembly plant, but there’s zero sense of hurry. The place is almost tranquil, with the most jarring noises coming when the car horns are being tested. A mechanic pops her head out from a car's engine compartment. Axles and engines sit in preparation to be attached to the next Ghost shell coming up the line. At this stage, the cars get hoisted up and the engine and axle are slid in on a platform underneath them. Rolls-Royce refers to the process of attaching them into one unified whole as “the marriage,” which is apparently the most popular process for visiting customers to see. An engine undergoes final checks before being attached to its future home. One of the subtler extras that Rolls-Royce offers is to line the ceiling of your car with an illuminated star pattern. If you’re demanding enough, the company will even plot out a particular alignment of the night sky and recreate it in the car. This is done using fiber optic strands that are threaded into the leather and connected to LED lights at the periphery. It’s a painstaking process done entirely by hand. The path outlined in yellow on the left is for pedestrians and visitors while the main walkway is reserved for the transportation of parts and machinery. Both the leather embroidery and the finely lacquered wood paneling on this Ghost door are done by hand at Rolls-Royce’s in-house woodworking and leather shops. Fastidiousness is the number one job skill required by Rolls-Royce and the company’s inspection processes run through the entire assembly line. The cars that require greater customization come decorated with an appropriately extensive set of paperwork. There’s an endless choice of finishes and varieties you can choose from, and where the thing you want doesn’t exist, Rolls-Royce has the resources and skilled craftspeople to just make it. This is Rolls-Royce’s customization area where the few things that can’t be done on the general assembly line are taken care of. This way the company can maintain its reputation for a perfectly bespoke design for each car while still getting the benefits of serialized production. The 6.75L V12 engine inside the limited edition Phantom Waterspeed. The engine is painted in the same Maggiore Blue as the car, and similar blue accents can be found on the wheels and throughout the car’s interior. Only 35 of these cars have been made to celebrate Sir Malcolm Campbell’s pursuit of the world speed record for travelling on water. A phantom spreads its wings. The inside of the Rolls-Royce Phantom is so vast and spacious that it really feels like a modern-day carriage. What could be more bespoke than making everything in and out of the car a canary yellow? Rolls-Royce diplomatically refers to these design choices as “interesting.” Rolls-Royce uses solid tulip wood for most of its paneling before applying a veneer of the customer’s choice. And there is a lot of choice. Each of the different colors in the leaves is a separate piece of wood. The painstaking process of assembling them all into one piece of interior Rolls-Royce decoration is as labor-intensive as the hand-stitched personalized motifs that are woven into the cars’ leather upholstery. This is the first edition of the Rolls-Royce Phantom powertrain, which has since been superseded by a newer model. Another angle of the enormous beast that’s required to push the two-ton Phantoms around. The nearly completed cars undergo final validation and testing procedures. There’s even an anechoic chamber where noise inside the cabin is carefully measured while going over simulated bumps in the road. If the ride is deemed too noisy, the car is sent back for improvement. In a sea of austere black Ghosts, the red Wraith stands out dramatically. This is what I’d imagine an Audi TT made by Rolls-Royce would look like. Every set of seats and doors is made especially for the car ordered. Even in its recent record years, Rolls-Royce keeps to an extremely low volume of sales, with last year reaching 3,630 cars delivered. You can buy a Spirit of Ecstasy for your desk, but don’t expect to find the Rolls-Royce name strewn across random memorabilia made by other companies. If it has the RR initials on it, it’s made here in the Goodwood home of the company. Rolls-Royce only uses bull hides from Scandinavia. This is because they don’t get the stretch marks associated with pregnancy and there are fewer bugs to bite them and spoil the uniform look. This car costs more than my home. Rolls-Royce describes the Ghost as the car for those who want to be chauffeured around five days a week and then actually drive their luxury vehicle on the weekend. Inside, everything is covered in solid wood and hand-stitched leather. The steering wheel opts for the “more is more” philosophy with a full complement of chromed-out buttons and toggles.",0.6416039325007261,0.3583960674992739,0.5711021780353852,1471,5.0353501019714484,729,6.3731138545953359,0,88,"Transportation, Photo Essay",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

This isn't a lewd joke much of the internet imagined: it's the company's new dual-motor, all-wheel-drive version of its Model S sedan, one that promises faster acceleration, and better performance in inclement weather — one of the S' biggest weaknesses. And as Musk would like everybody to know, it's fast. Really fast. ""We're able to improve everything about the car,"" Musk says after summoning the car's chassis from beneath the stage while thumping music flows out over a large crowd of people who have spent the past hour sipping free drinks. For a price, the new models of the S will get a ""D"" on the end. It's not just a badge, but a new system that puts a motor in the front as well as the back of the vehicle. There will be three configurations: the 60D and the 85D, along with a top of the line P85D. The P85D starts going out to buyers in December, with the 60D and lower-end 85D going out in February. Musk did not talk specifics on price, but it's not cheap. Tesla says the base price of the P85D is $120,170, a $14,600 premium as part of an options package from the standard P85 model.  Nearly everyone else already has all-wheel-drive The lack of all-wheel drive has been a shortcoming for the Model S since the first cars rolled off the production line in 2012, with Tesla opting to make it rear-wheel drive instead. That's common among performance cars, but has also left the car lacking compared to competing luxury vehicles from Audi, BMW, Mercedes, and others — particularly in colder climates.   The big question is how the new configuration affects both the car's range, as well as its handling. Today, ahead of a launch for the D, Musk told USA Today the new configuration would up that range by an extra 10 miles per charge, and bring a 0 to 60 time to just 3.2 seconds on the performance model.   Every new Model S is Autopilot enabled. pic.twitter.com/KH9Mx7GF21    Along with the change to the motor configuration, Tesla's added new safety features that help its S models do certain things on the road without driver intervention. It's using cameras and other sensors, something the company has been installing on all new Model S vehicles produced over the past month to conform with European safety regulations. It allows the car to look for objects  — including other cars — as well as road lines. That's not a new thing in the auto industry, but an important step in getting cars to be completely autonomous, something Musk has said is still 5 to 6 years away from being a reality.   The system employs an array of different systems, including forward-looking radar, a camera with image recognition, as well as 360 degree sonar. Musk referred to the system as ""autopilot"" — a term he's used before — saying that the company would be pushing this to see what it could do in terms of hardware as well as with regulations. That gives it lane control, active emergency braking, and self parking (including automatic parallel parking). Self-driving technologies that do more than just keep the car from drifting out of lanes and hitting objects are the next logical step, promising to increase safety and allow drivers to essentially become just another passenger. Computer-controlled cars also promise to react to things faster, and could open up certain sections of roadways to higher speeds given the extra reaction time — speeding up long distance car travel. ""It's like taking off from a carrier deck."" Tesla is far from alone in that pursuit. Audi, BMW, Toyota, and others are all developing self-driving technologies, with many using California as a testbed. Last month the state began issuing permits for limited testing on self-driving vehicles on state roads. Tesla is not part of that group yet, but is promising drivers of today something they'd actually want to control. ""This car is nuts,"" Musk told an excited crowd filled with Tesla owners. ""It's like taking off from a carrier deck. It's bananas. It's like having your own personal roller coaster that you can use at any time.""

It cost him nearly $100,000. Cars are to Rolls-Royce as search is to Google. They’re the thing that brings customers in, but not the way that the company makes its money. Google does it by selling ads, Rolls-Royce does it by selling the experience of luxury. No other brand in the world is more readily identified with the notion of luxury, nor is there one that has greater authority to dictate exactly what that means. The technology industry is now on a march into this realm of exclusive opulence with the solid-gold Apple Watch, the Montblanc and Swarovski Galaxy Notes, and a series of Porsche Design BlackBerrys. Personal electronics are growing into cheap, easily replicable commodities, so their makers are looking to distinguish themselves with fancier materials and a greater emphasis on craftsmanship. Rolls-Royce has been a leader in both for over a century now, so I went to see how the modern company operates and what lessons it may have for the electronics giants looking to follow its example. Depending on how you look at it, Rolls-Royce is either a century or a decade old. The name carries a proud tradition stretching back to the original company founded by Charles Rolls and Sir Henry Royce in 1904, however the Rolls-Royce Motor Cars of today only came into existence in 1998 and didn’t have a vehicle on the road until 2003. In spite of starting from scratch at the turn of the century, BMW has managed to resurrect the famed marque to such a high standard that it’s now had four consecutive record years of sales. Neither the five-year hiatus nor the fundamental change in how Rolls-Royce cars are made was able to tarnish the brand’s reputation and desirability. Some brands simply transcend their product. As enduring as the appeal of the ""Spirit of Ecstasy"" hood ornament may be, it couldn’t have sustained the new Rolls-Royce indefinitely on reputation alone. The new company operates in a distinctly modern way that reminds me of my visit to Vertu’s headquarters. Like the luxury mobile maker, Rolls-Royce has one single facility housing both its manufacturing and corporate operations. The assembly line is only a short walk from the executives’ offices. Designed by Sir Nicholas Grimshaw, the headquarters is basically one giant, delightful advertisement for Rolls-Royce and its ideals. The 7-acre building is dug low into the ground and covered with England’s largest grass roof, so it nestles inconspicuously into the leafy countryside. Vast glass walls and enormous circular skylights flood the work floor with natural light and make all the machinery feel almost organic. ""It’s the best showroom in the world,"" says Rolls-Royce Communications Manager James Warren as he ushers me into a big leather seat in one of the client meeting rooms.   Speaking with James quickly underscores for me the fact that Rolls-Royce really isn’t in the car business at all. He tells me that the current top-of-the-line Rolls-Royce Phantom has class-leading fuel efficiency (somewhere in the ""high 20s"" miles per gallon), but when I ask him to cite another car in that class, he struggles to find a suitable answer. Maybe the Bentley Flying Spur comes close, he says, but the people who buy a Rolls-Royce aren’t comparing that purchase against another car — they are weighing it up as an alternative to a new yacht, a helicopter, a piece of fine art, or a new beach house. The car is almost incidental to the pursuit of a rare and exclusive treat. To own a Rolls-Royce is universally recognized as ""the ultimate expression that you have made it,"" says Warren, even by those who are unimpressed by the marque’s conservative grandeur. It is conspicuous consumption of the highest order, and the company is perfectly content with its role of satisfying that niche but highly profitable demand: ""no one needs a Rolls-Royce, we are very open about that. These are purchases of the heart."" And yet, in spite of its sustained popularity, Rolls-Royce is starting to lean toward a younger audience, introducing the more driver-oriented Ghost in 2010 and the closest thing to a sports car the company will likely ever do, 2013’s Wraith. The average Phantom buyer is 55, an age that drops to the mid-40s for Ghost owners and as low as the 30s for Wraith. This shift in clientele isn’t happening by lowering prices, mind you, as the most affordable of these cars still costs in excess of $350,000 before even adding any bespoke elements. The personal touch is what truly makes the Rolls-Royce brand seductive. Customers are invited to visit the Goodwood home of the company, tour its assembly line, and peruse a library of previous customizations done for others. They then get to sit in the same glass-walled meeting room I’m in and talk directly to the designer that will personalize their car. There’s no ""no"" in the Rolls-Royce vocabulary, with the company having already color-matched a lipstick, a dog’s fur, and a McLaren supercar to give its clients the precise paint job they desire. One customer wanted the timber from a tree that had fallen on his lands to be used inside his Rolls-Royce, so of course he got it. ""It can be a little whimsical,"" says Warren, as ""customers invest their own passions and interests into the cars."" Rolls-Royce is famous for its effortless and whisper-quiet ride, but the thing people are buying in increasing numbers is its emotional resonance. By going to extraordinary lengths to personalize a product, the company gives each customer something authentically his or hers, and by maintaining its high reputation for excellence, it adds a historic cachet that others are simply not able to match.   Among electronics companies, only Apple appears fully conscious of this high-end appeal. Like Rolls-Royce’s promises of ""presence"" and ""drama,"" the Apple Watch ""allows you to see time in the ways that are most meaningful to you."" Specs and utilitarian functionality are replaced by more ethereal concepts because these objects are designed to appeal to something more primordial and basic in human nature. The specifics of what luxury is will always change with time, but the essence of it, the thing that will endure as long as the Rolls-Royce brand has done, is the emotional connection.",0.6601803762579312,0.33981962374206875,0.16353350507106987,1077,5.0148560817084498,585,6.316239316239316,0,16,"Culture, Transportation, Report",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

Many automakers and suppliers have congealed around 2020 as reasonable guidance for when publicly available cars are capable of running in a substantially autonomous mode, though key features of self-driving cars are coming sooner — GM has promised a hands-free mode for some 2017 models, and Audi has been making the PR tour this year for its ""piloted driving"" features. Hands-free highway driving is easier to process than rat's nests of traffic- and obstacle-filled surface streets, which helps explain his ""90 percent"" target. Possibly related, Musk has a set of Tesla announcements lined up for October 9th, where he has promised ""the D and something else."" It's not known what either of those reference, but the company is expected to release an all-wheel-drive version of the Model S and the production version of the Model X in the near future.

The car's full name is actually Asterion LPI 910-4: LPI stands for ""longitudinale posteriore ibrido,"" a reference to the location of the 610-horsepower V10 and the hybrid drivetrain. 910-4 refers to the all-wheel-drive configuration and the 910 total horsepower, 300 of which comes from the electric motors. The car can either operate with the full 910 horses in action, or in a pure electric mode which delivers power to motors mounted in the front axle alone. 62mph comes in three seconds, and top speed is just shy of 200mph. Hybrids are still relatively rare in the performance segment, although they're gaining acceptance: Ferrari's LaFerrari and McLaren's P1 have both climbed on the hybrid train. What makes Lamborghini unique with the Asterion is how hard it's pushing the environmental angle: carbon dioxide emission reduction is prominently mentioned in the car's press release, and it touts a pure-electric driving range of 50km (31 miles). It may not see production in exactly this form, but it's hard to imagine the company would put this much thought and effort into a next-gen drivetrain without commercializing it. As with all Lamborghinis, the Asterion has a bull-themed name: in this case, it's ""the proper name of the mythical Minotaur,"" the company says — half-man, half-bull.

Margi Bradway noticed something peculiar when she went on a biking trip last year. Before her friends got on their bikes, they all pulled out smartphones. “Everyone was clicking on their Strava,” she recalls. Bradway, the active transportation policy lead at the Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT) at the time, had an idea. Could data collected by Strava, a popular GPS-powered app that lets cyclists and runners log workouts and commutes, make her home city of Portland a safer place for bike-riders?   Portland is already a better city than most for cyclists: Hawthorne Bridge, one of the city’s five bike-friendly bridges, averages 1.7 million bike trips a year, and the city boasts 300 miles of bike lanes. But Portland relies on a very rudimentary method for collecting data on cyclists and the trips they make: volunteers count riders at various intersections around the city. Without better information, it’s difficult to improve on what already exists. Strava might change that. Late last year, ODOT licensed a Strava metro data set of 17,700 riders and 400,000 bike trips around Portland. That adds up to 5 million BMTs (bicycle miles traveled) logged in 2013 alone. The data is now being parsed as ODOT determines what kinds of infrastructure needs that information reveals. Though some members of the Strava community have expressed privacy concerns, company co-founder and president Michael Horvath says that most riders are enthused about the partnership. Horvath points out that every user has the choice to opt out of the program, and that rider data ""has been disaggregated and anonymized"" to protect identities. For now, the system’s biggest challenge is sample bias. To use Strava, one must own a smartphone, a technology that isn’t affordable for everyone. ""People being counted by Strava are those who already have a powerful voice in bicycle advocacy and whose needs are already well on their way to being met,"" says Elly Blue, Portland resident and author of Bikenomics: How Bicycling Can Save the Economy. Bradway and the department know the Strava data set isn’t perfect. ""But don’t let perfect be the enemy of the good,"" she says. Meanwhile, municipalities around the world are taking note of Portland’s progress: Strava has already partnered with 15 other cities — including Orlando and London — on similar programs. ""I think it shows that the data that we’re collecting on cycling, running, and other forms of physical activity can really inform and educate,"" Horvath says. ""I’d like to see it in every major [city], and even small cities around the world.""",0.74791189006956,0.25208810993043995,0.8149138222127007,438,5.1803652968036529,279,6.0501792114695343,0,4,"Transportation, Detours",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

What does it mean to be a celebrated designer? Is it being on the cover of Time Magazine, designing some of America's best-loved exports, or is it something as simple as being recognized with a Google Doodle? Raymond Loewy, one of the 20th century's most prolific and influential designers has now achieved all three, thanks to today's Google celebration of his 120th birthday. In the same spirit, we've compiled a few of Loewy's most memorable designs for you to peruse on this fifth day of November.  Every time the US President takes off to faraway lands, he does so inside the Loewy-designed shell of Air Force One. The two complementary tones of blue and the Caslon typeface have remained undisturbed since the original design was put together for President Kennedy in the '60s. Though the defining characteristic of Loewy's legacy is the sheer breadth of his work, much of his early career was spent designing locomotives for outfits like the Pennsylvania Railroad company. That's what gives the 'PRR' designation to the PRR S1 steam train you see above. Loewy redesigned the Studebaker car company's logo and produced famed designs like the Starlight in the 1950s and this 1963 classic, the Avanti. The Studebaker Avanti was designed in a very short period of time by Loewy’s hand-picked team of young designers, led by John Ebstein. Image credit: Bonhams auction house In an extensive partnership with Coca-Cola, Loewy was responsible for a significant redesign of the iconic glass bottle, though his most original work came when designing vending, soda, and ice dispensing machines. Image credit: Richard Lipack / Wikimedia Commons Along with Marlboro, Lucky Strike cigarette packs are among the most easily recognizable around the globe. Raymond Loewy was responsible for their look, changing the original tobacco green background color to white and making the bullseye logo more prominent. Though they've undergone subtle alterations over the years, Lucky Strikes have remained faithful to Loewy's basic design ever since. It was only this year that the company underwent a major redesign, bringing in some throwback elements and changing up the typeface. Over its long and storied history, the Royal Dutch Shell company has always been represented by the image of a seashell, but it wasn’t until 1971 that its logo took on the more geometric form by which it is known around the world today. Legendary enough to have been commemorated with a US Postal Service stamp in 2011, the streamlined pencil sharpener was one of Loewy's earlier designs. Loewy later had another encounter with the USPS in designing a memorial stamp for John F. Kennedy. As with Studebaker, Loewy's work with the Greyhound Lines bus company involved both the creation of a new streamlined logo and bold new designs like the Scenicruiser.

Robert Andersen was feeling flustered. Square founder Jack Dorsey had asked him to design a product that was so simple, it wouldn’t even have an interface. ""Square Cash"" would let people send money over email. Andersen had previously designed email receipts for Square’s array of business products, but had never designed a product built on email and email alone. Dorsey took a look at Andersen’s initial designs and asked for a do-over. ""You know what, go to the MoMA,"" Dorsey quipped. Andersen dropped what he was doing and walked a few blocks to the museum. Thus began Andersen’s unmistakably Silicon Valley-esque tale of Square Cash’s conception. As he wandered from room to room, he stumbled upon ""The Occupation,"" a surrealist oil painting of soldiers on a city street by artist Mark Tansey. The painting was detailed but monochromatic, and completely washed over with red, as he describes it. Andersen paused, but then rushed back to the office, along the way shooting some video on the street using his iPhone. Once back at his computer, he applied a colored filter to the footage and showed it to Dorsey. ""Yep, that’s great,"" Jack told him. ""I love it.""   The Square cash website, today Andersen is Square’s creative director — employee number four of a team that now numbers over 600. He first met Dorsey in 2008, when his PocketTweets web app for iPhone caught the attention of the Twitter co-founder. Some time later, Dorsey gave Andersen one of the first peeks at his new product, Square, and hired him to helm the company’s design team. The duo have since worked together on everything from the original Square device (which was once called Squirrel) to Square Register and now Square Cash. But whereas Square’s products up to this point had been made of plastic, or coded into an app, Square Cash would be neither. At first, Andersen thought Dorsey was crazy. ""Jack is very much into how can you take something and simplify it down to its essence."" ""What if you could send money to people over email?"" Dorsey asked him in January of this year. ""Jack is very much into how can you take something and simplify it down to its essence. This is a very Jack and a very Square idea,"" Andersen says. But why email, an age-old medium people decry on a daily basis, and why ""cash,"" a metaphor that is quickly losing value? At Square, Andersen says, the goal is not necessarily to supplant the tools we use on a daily basis, but to make them more useful. The original Square device, for example, didn’t bundle in NFC for wireless payments, but instead made accepting credit cards easier. This approach — to augment and reshape our current technology rather than replace it, has thus far been working for Square.  An early mock-up of the Square Cash onboarding experience. The principle of Square Cash was exciting to Andersen, but also intimidating. ""Very few relevant companies have ever built a product this immersive on top of email,"" he says. ""It was something we didn’t know how to do, so you start getting paranoid about whether it’s the right decision."" The first step was drawing up a prototype within the company to let employees send money to each other. ""There was no front-end UI — it was all email-based,"" says Andersen. ""It was really flat, and a little bit boring."" Most importantly, you had to set up your email and debit card using the site before you could send money, as with most payment apps like Venmo. After months of testing, they decided to reverse the process. Instead of having to sign up, like you do with most apps and services, you start using it by sending an email and cc’ing Square. One of Dorsey’s directives was that users shouldn’t have to come up with new usernames and passwords One of Dorsey’s most critical directives during the process was that users shouldn’t have to come up with new usernames and passwords, because in real life, you don’t need a password to hand some money to a friend. Considering Dorsey’s obsession with emulating the ""real life"" transaction and short-form messaging, it’s almost a wonder that he didn’t push for SMS as the carrier for Cash. Instead he chose email, a clumsy and slow communication medium that everybody loves to hate. ""Email is a really interesting platform because it’s so ubiquitous,"" says Andersen. ""We each have an email app on our phone, and we all have email apps in the browser."" In other words, you don’t need to download an app to use Square Cash, because you already have the app, and most importantly, you already know to use it. ""We wanted to create the lowest common denominator way to use the service,"" Andersen says, ""because even downloading an app is enough friction that some people won’t do it.""  Another early mock-up of the Square Cash onboarding experience. Yet, as ostensibly simple as Square Cash is, there will be users who mistype or misremember who they’re supposed to cc in the email. Perhaps some of Square’s employees will still mess up the process — during its beta period, you were supposed to cc pay@square.com, not cash@square.com, what the company settled on for launch. So, Square made its own iPhone and Android app to help out, even though it seemed determined to build an ""email-only"" experience from beginning to end. However, the app serves little purpose other than to remind you how to use the service. ""Everyone has a smartphone, everyone has a debit card, everyone has an email."" The first time you open the app, it doesn’t ask you for a username, or to sign in using Facebook or Twitter. It just shows a big number pad where you can type in a dollar amount, and then pops up an empty email window with cash@square.com already filled into the cc field. ""We like the idea of you creating this thing you’re about to send someone else,"" Andersen says. ""You’re crafting the cash amount first, and then deciding who to send it to."" In a way, the app points out one of Square Cash’s most interesting features — the way it leverages not your social graph, like Facebook, but your ""email graph,"" as Andersen describes it. There are no friends to add, since your email app likely includes the addresses of your friends and family members. ""Everyone has a smartphone, everyone has a debit card, everyone has an email. All we’re doing is creating a wrapper of an app that makes using those things as simple as possible."" But for younger people, who are increasingly tethered to chat apps like Facebook Messenger and Snapchat instead of email, converting them to Square Cash could prove more challenging.  ""Jack knows best"" is a line you might hear around the Square office, but not in the sense you might think. Dorsey is made out to be a deity of sorts when you talk to observers or employees alike, but he isn’t made out to be a dictator. Andersen says that Dorsey's only mandate to his ""Squares,"" as employees are called, is to constantly question their assumptions. Just like the original Square app, Square Cash went through four redesigns,"" Andersen says. ""Over nine months, you become blind to the details, and whether or not something is good or bad,"" he says. ""It’s hard to clean up your perspective on what you’re working on."" Dorsey often steps in to offer a fresh take, and then bows out gracefully. A few weeks before launch, for example, the Cash website and emails were dressed in teal. ""We all loved the color,"" says Andersen, ""but Jack walked in and said ‘This color is drab.’"" He asked for something more fun and energetic. A few iterations later, the enigmatic Dorsey and company settled on a bright lime green. But don’t give all the credit to Dorsey. Andersen invented the @ reply on Twitter, after all, and has shown an aptitude for executing on the maxims that fly out of Dorsey’s mouth, seemingly on a daily basis, (like ""What if you could pay a friend with email?""), which are much easier said than done. ""It’s kind of like a puzzle,"" Andersen says, ""or it’s more like Algebra. You know what the answer is, so all you need to do is define the variables in order to get at the answer.""",0.6398187478209727,0.3601812521790273,0.850253193890555,1416,4.7591807909604515,646,6.0402476780185754,0,0,"Design, Report",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

The enclosed space at the center of the cylindrical apartment block was to house shops and a dry ski slope; some of its apartments were three stories tall and came with inbuilt hot tubs. But Ponte Tower fell into disrepair, and became a dirty, dangerous place. Philip Bloom's short film shows a pile of detritus three stories high where Ponte Tower's dry ski slope should be. He tells the story of a tower that grew more dilapidated over 30 years, as Johannesburg's moneyed classes moved away from the city center and out to the suburbs. But he also tells of the change that came to the building and its residents in the mid-2000s, when South African investors stepped in. They planned to renovate the entire building and complete the upper-class vision laid out in 1975.  2007's global financial crisis stymied their ambition. Ponte Tower hasn't yet received a complete renovation, it hasn't lured the city's elite inside its enclosed walls, and its dry ski slope likely won't ever be completed. But unlike the fates of other failed skyscrapers and tower blocks, the third tallest building in Africa has received enough funding to function as something better for the people of the city: a secure home.

Before being bought by Starbucks last year, Teavana had primarily been known for retail shops that sold tea and supplies — but didn't serve the drink. With the tea bar concept, Starbucks had to rethink some of the most basic elements of its successful formula for a different kind of customer — including the paper cup itself. FastCoDesign takes a look at the result of Starbucks' design efforts. The goal was to make a cup that felt more like drinking from china than a flimsy, on-the-go piece of cardboard. Double-walled insulation was built into the cup itself, foregoing the need for the cheap cardboard sleeves Starbucks customers (and coffee drinkers everywhere) need to deal with. The texture of the cup itself is different as well; embossed paper is used to provide what's described as a ""feathery"" and ""foamy"" feel. According to the report, the insulating design requires around 50 percent more material than is used in traditional Starbucks cups and sleeves. Of course, the way the cup feels in the hand is just one element of the experience. The lid also garnered significant attention, with a molded face and wider spout when compared to coffee cups. With Starbucks' creative director of emerging brands, Daniele Monti, telling FastCoDesign that the new design has found quite a following inside the company, we might even see some of these improvements coming to coffee drinkers as well.

But as Bono made clear on stage, someone had to make up the difference. ""First you would have to pay for it,"" he told Cook, ""because we’re not going in for the free music around here."" ""We’re not going in for the free music around here."" So what does 500 million records cost these days? According to several reports Apple is spending at least $100 million to market the album, plus an undisclosed lump sum that goes to U2 as a direct payment. That's an enormous promotional budget for a single album, but for Apple, the price tag is pretty easy to swallow. First off, Apple's marketing campaign will likely tie into its own products heavily. So while it's putting up billboards, TV spots, and display ads for Songs of Innocence, it will also probably be pushing iTunes and its new smartphone and watch. Secondly, Apple has an ungodly amount of money in the bank — $150 billion and counting. The entire U2 spend constitutes a few days of profits. If anything, the $100 million figure, while eye popping at first, really highlights how devalued music has become as a commercial commodity, especially compared with the devices and software we use to listen to it. Over at Pitchfork, Rob Mitchum brilliantly laid out the diminished state of the record industry and the ascension of free as the dominant paradigm for artistic consumption. Time was, the recipe for a superstar artist to create a Big Event Album was well known—a few teaser ads in the music mags, a lead single for radio, some late-night talk show appearances, then sit back and watch the fans line up at the record store on release day. But now that basically every entity in that sentence has been culturally marginalized, and the propeller churn of social media refuses to tolerate slow-burn marketing, the best—and, perhaps, only—way to get everyone talking about your record at once is to release it with no warning. U2 being U2, they’ve taken that strategy one step over the line into indisputably queasy territory, aligning with their old friends Apple to insert their new album, Songs of Innocence, into all of our libraries without consent. By updating the old Columbia House Record Club scam to the digital age, U2 and their Cupertino buddies have created a new avenue of opt-out cultural transmission, removing even the miniscule effort it takes to go to a website and click ""Download.""",0.6199287259766406,0.3800712740233594,0.8426909849825246,447,4.8143176733780759,289,5.7301038062283736,0,0,"Apple, Business, Culture, Entertainment, Tech",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

The company also says that across all of its 859 combined FM and AM stations, it reaches 245 million people in the US every month, including ""93 percent of Millennials."" iHeartMedia will continue to focus on delivering music and talk radio, but as the new name indicates, the company will attempt to branch out into other types of content as well. That may be a prudent move, given the fact that radio is a tough business with rivals like Spotify, Pandora and Beats around. iHeartMedia also still carries a heavy debt load (over $20 billion, according to the LA Times) since being taken over by private equity firms back in 2008.",0.6220194768879178,0.3779805231120822,0.8372135806192255,250,5.0,173,5.6473988439306355,0,0,Business,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

(After the story broke, the account was unlocked three days later, though PayPal allegedly held 5 percent of sales in temporary ""reserve."") But it doesn't run iCloud. PayPal shut down a Secret Santa fundraiser run by the blog Regretsy because of confusion over its donation policy, allegedly demanding that they refund the money but keeping the processing fees. It then allegedly froze Regretsy founder April Winchell's personal account after she complained, while providing opaque and hostile customer service. (After the story broke, PayPal muddled through an apology and said it would donate a $100 gift card to the families Regretsy was trying to help. Apparently the issue, once again, was donations coming in fast enough that PayPal flagged the account activity as suspicious.) But it doesn't run iCloud. PayPal allegedly threatened to freeze processing capabilities for the entirety of crowdfunding site Patreon if it didn't immediately hide any campaigns promoting ""adult content,"" which included, among other things, porn performer Kitty Stryker's (non-pornographic) blog on feminism and sexuality. Once again, though, not iCloud. PayPal allegedly failed to fix a hole in its two-factor security until its discoverer, a 17-year-old bug hunter, published it publicly two months later. Still not iCloud. PayPal was trusted with $125 billion in funds from merchants in 2013, and it's moved into a role once played only by huge banks and credit card companies. It can be expected to screw up sometimes, at least outside the vital security front. It's unambiguously defended itself against other accusations, like a charge that it gave hackers access to a customer's account information. But it handles ridiculous amounts of money. People's livelihoods are in its hands. And too often, it makes those people angry with unclear policies, bad feedback, and an inflexibility that doesn't match its up-to-the-minute, payment-system-of-the-future message.

Pretty soon Pakman joined them a few times, and got hooked. So that the family could play together, Pakman set up his own server, hosting a private community for the three of them. Slowly, his children’s friends began to join, and three years later, there are more than 100 kids and parents from around his neighborhood who log on to Pakman’s server. They've built churches, libraries, airports, castles, and farms. “It’s the basis for a huge amount of the interaction that happens between the kids in town.” With its $2.5 billion purchase of Mojang, the parent company behind Minecraft, Microsoft is gaining a profitable, fast growing company. Mojang reportedly book over $100 million in profit last year and has only around 40 employees. Minecraft offers Microsoft a platform with strong elements of social and mobile usage, two areas where it has struggled so far. But perhaps most importantly, Minecraft gives Microsoft an intergenerational success story that few other games or services can replicate. The Verge spoke with dozens of parents who see Minecraft not only as an incredible tool for bonding with their children, but a gateway to education in computer science that could restore some appeal to the Microsoft brand for the next generation. Ari Paparo, an ad-tech entrepreneur in New York, plays Minecraft with his own children. “My eight year-old son says: ‘If Apple wanted to get cooler they would buy Minecraft instead of Beats.’""   In Minecraft, users move around a virtual world, harvesting resources like wood, gold, and iron ore that they can use to build whatever they like. Everything is made of textured 3D cubes. The graphics are extremely low-fi. There are bad guys to watch out for and defeat, and technically a dragon you can slay to beat the game, but what has captivated millions is the total freedom Minecraft offers to wander around and build, often collaboratively, a huge world of you own. ""It’s not a game exactly, or a social network, although it has elements of both,"" says Pakman. ""It’s a canvas that offers near total freedom to build your own world, and that has turned out to be extremely appealing to a lot of kids and adults."" Steven Sorka, a 36-year-old software developer from Toronto, has never beaten Minecraft, at least not without cheating. He always gets killed by the Ender Dragon, but it doesn’t matter. ""You can spend a lot of time enchanting swords and trying to defeat the Ender dragon. But lots of kids are also perfectly happy just riding pigs, building houses, and exploring cities,"" says Sorka, who plays with his 20-year-old stepson and 11-year-old daughter. He sees the game’s flexibility as the key. ""There are other games that have crossed generations, but Minecraft seems to be a perfect storm of Lego and adventure that has appeal for all.""    Another big reason Minecraft appeals to younger players is that it’s easy to learn and impossible to lose. ""There’s no minimum skill level,"" says Sorka. ""If you die, you respawn. Maybe you dropped some stuff, but that probably doesn’t matter if you just like running around and following your big brother."" He has played with big groups of adult friends, but now spends the majority of his time playing with his children and their cousins. ""I’d love to play more video games with them, but there’s few that have a low barrier to entry and capture the attention of young ones."" Of course, just because you can’t lose doesn’t mean things can’t go wrong. Just like at school, in any group of kids there will be a few bullies, known as ""griefers"" in Minecraft parlance. But because parents can set up their own servers for their children to play on, they can exert a level of control and protection that isn’t always possible in the real world. ""I got a frantic call at work,"" remembers Pakman. ""Some kids had come into the server and were destroying homes and killing players. So, I banned a few of the wrong-doers. Now we have griefing-protection tools and anti-cheat technology on the server to help bring a little order to the world. Not too much, but just enough to keep the community healthy."" A lot of parents are especially happy to spend time and money on Minecraft for their kids because they see it as a teaching tool. Minecraft can educate kids about architecture, and players can use something called redstone circuits to create simple mechanical devices, even entire computers, out of Minecraft blocks. And while Mojang offers a number of different versions and upgrades of Minecraft to download, the incredible variety of worlds to explore and items you can build comes from ""mods"", modified software created by the community that can be installed on a server to reshape that world or the rules that govern it. For many young players, mods become a gateway to the world of computer programming, something parents, and perhaps Microsoft as well, are keen to encourage. Peter Grace says his son became interested around the age of three after seeing him play. ""He became very fond of the game very quickly, as many kids with autism do."" Grace started a family-friendly server called Blocktown.org, which now has a few dozen dedicated regulars. ""It has definitely prompted my son to want to build custom mods for Minecraft. I just recently purchased a beginning programming book for him so that he can get the basics before we move on to Java."" Trei Brundrett, the chief product officer at The Verge’s parent company, Vox, played with his two sons Aedan and Joseph. They started out by sitting together on the couch playing in the same world over a LAN (local area network.) ""It felt like playing LEGO with him, but obviously much more interactive. We'd spend hours building giant cities, dividing up responsibility for different parts that would connect together."" Soon, however, the boys wanted to progress to custom games, which meant adding on mods. ""Aeden taught himself how to find, download and install the mods on his own local machine. He quickly cycled through many of them. And inevitably he wanted to make his own."" For a while Aedan just watched as Brundrett learned the basics of how to create mods. Then he enrolled in a summer camp to learn Java. ""Eventually he created his own simple mod - just his own block that he could insert into the world. The mystery of programming, of software, of Minecraft and mods, disappeared. I've never seen him more proud. And man I was proud too - my kid didn't just play a game on his computer, he had hacked it - just like I did on my Apple IIe. Sitting next to my kid writing code, hacking on a game together is an amazing experience."" Microsoft is not doubt eager to own a profitable game which can give them a foothold among young consumers, especially a platform with strong social and mobile elements. Minecraft has consistently been one of the most downloaded apps in the paid category on iOS and Android. But Brundrett and many other parents thinks it goes much deeper than that. ""Honestly, I think there is a Minecraft generation, one that is learning that you don't just have to use computers, that you can make things with these machines, that you can hack it."" There have been more than 12 million downloads of Minecraft on the Xbox console, and over 16.6 million copies sold for Mac and PC. Hacking Minecraft requires owning an honest to goodness computer, not a tablet or smartphone. That’s a potential upside for desktop operating systems like Windows. Hacking also means learning about how servers and APIs work. If kids are learning that stuff while interacting with Microsoft’s cloud, they might be more willing to use its other services and products down the road. Whether Microsoft can maintain the momentum of Minecraft, and perhaps absorb some of it’s goodwill, remains to be seen. ""I really do worry that Microsoft may not understand this ecosystem,"" says Brundrett. ""However, as someone who worked quite a bit for Microsoft (through my own software firm) I know that they do get what it means to create a turn-key world for their developers with great tools and documentation."" Brundrett, like many techie parents, says there is plenty of room for improving how players interact with Minecraft and how different communities play together. But fixing all the rough edges, could also lessen the charm. ""It just might not be the same as having to sort through the mess,"" Brundrett says. ""There is something unique about not just following instructions, but bridging the gaps through extra research, wild leaps of experimentation.""",0.6477671276761952,0.35223287232380485,0.8288758059775535,1516,4.8898416886543536,737,6.1506105834464044,1,4,"Business, Culture, Gaming",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

Sony has been in rebuilding mode for a number of years now, looking to narrow down its focus around Kaz Hirai's One Sony strategy and become a more cohesive and agile company.

That means a reduction in mid-range devices and a focus on the premium lineup that was recently refreshed with the Xperia Z3 family. Sony identifies a ""significant change in the market and competitive environment of the mobile business"" as the primary cause of its frustrated ambitions. Given that its issues relate mostly to the more price-sensitive entry-level and mid-range devices, it's reasonable to conclude that Sony is suffering at the hands of cheaper Chinese alternatives (and even American ones in the shape of the Moto G) in the same way that Samsung is.

The messages were loud and clear. Don’t lose or break your equipment, and don’t use your own. I don’t know what kind of orientation Hillary Clinton got when she joined the administration, but we now know she chose to use her own equipment. Before I was a career fed at an agency, I was a political appointee at the White House — a staff constantly under scrutiny from the press, more so than most of our non-political colleagues. Because of that pressure, we invoked the ""Washington Post test"" nearly every day. How would you feel if the email you’re writing showed up on A1 of the Post? Did someone send you an email saying something you were uncomfortable with? Respond in writing making it clear you disagree. Did someone ask you over the phone to do something you’re even remotely uncomfortable with? Ask them to put it in writing — in email.  It wasn’t just bureaucracy, regulations, and red tape that made this demand for transparency clear. We all knew the stories of others in government who had been chastised for failing to properly maintain their records. Just before Obama took office, Bush administration officials, including Karl Rove, were charged with ""using nongovernmental accounts specifically to avoid creating a record of the communications"" in the middle of political scandal. The IRS was admonished for its inability to produce a full record of Lois Lerner’s emails due to a computer crash. Deputy White House CTO (and former Google public policy director) Andrew McLaughlin was scolded for using his personal Gmail instead of his .gov address to conduct business. EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson and HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius caught flak for using email aliases, even though they were on federal systems and being documented like any other .gov address. I never ran into anything that would be A1 material in my time as a government employee, political or career. But the burden — the seriousness — of leaving records behind and recording our work was ever-present. Why go through the trouble of creating a personal email system? The New York Times and others reported this week that Hillary Clinton used a non-government email account to conduct government business during her tenure as Secretary of State, likely breaching at least the spirit of federal regulations requiring that such communications be logged. Clinton’s staff has responded by saying they complied with both the spirit and the letter of relevant regulations. A tweet from Clinton’s own Twitter account states plainly, ""I want the public to see my email. I asked State to release them. They said they will review them for release as soon as possible."" But if they fully intended to keep records of all her correspondence, why did they go to the trouble of setting up a personal server in her own home to send emails? I want the public to see my email. I asked State to release them. They said they will review them for release as soon as possible.  Clinton spokesperson Nick Merrill told Business Insider that for government business, Clinton emailed colleagues on their official government accounts ""with every expectation they would be retained."" But as Gawker reported, some of Clinton’s top aides, including her deputy assistant secretary of state and her deputy chief of staff, allegedly had their own private accounts — meaning any emails sent exclusively between State’s top leadership weren’t automatically being retained by the government. To make things worse, Clinton’s staff gets to decide which emails to turn over to the government. There’s nothing transparent about this scheme. Clinton surrounded herself with tech-savvy advisors This wasn’t a matter of ignorance. Clinton famously surrounded herself with tech-savvy advisors from Silicon Valley like Jared Cohen and Alec Ross, pushing the reserved agency to adopt what they called ""21st century statecraft."" Clinton’s boss, President Obama, appointed the first federal Chief Technology Officer and has claimed to prioritize transparency efforts across his administration. Even without those senior advisors, there is an entire federal agency — the National Archives and Records Administration — that concerns itself with records keeping. And the Obama White House has made it clear that they issued ""very specific guidance"" to administration officials telling them they should use official email accounts when conducting government business. At this point, we can only guess why Clinton and her staff chose not to use official systems. And the most obvious guess at this point is a fear of transparency. Congressional oversight committees, FOIA-demanding journalists, diligent historians, and even everyday citizens have more ways than ever to monitor the work of public officials and to acquire records of their correspondence, budgets, and all manner of comings and goings. Just today, the House committee that has been obsessed with Clinton’s involvement in the Benghazi embassy attack for years subpoenaed her personal email account. We don't know how much email there is, or if any has been deleted But how much actual business does a cabinet secretary conduct over email? Closed door meetings happen all the time. Press access to leaders and politicians is tightly controlled. White House staff frequently have off-the-record meetings at coffee shops across the street from their offices to avoid having their guests appear on visitor logs. Still, Clinton seems to be sitting on a trove of email. Following reports this week about her private email habits, Clinton’s allies assured the public that more than 50,000 emails have already been turned over to the state. We just don’t know how many more there are and if any have been destroyed. Of course, as Vox’s Ezra Klein argues, it’s silly to think everything our leaders do will be caught by the public eye. We’ll never be fully aware of what our secretaries of state say and do or to whom. Watergate taught politicians not to tape their calls and, maybe, not to use official email accounts. But honest leaders shouldn’t be afraid of sunlight. Hillary Clinton had an easy opportunity to participate in a system that keeps government more accountable for its actions, and she opted to evade it.

A proposal put forward by Latvia would reportedly allow telecoms companies to ""enter into agreements"" with companies and individuals to provide faster internet speeds — so long as these deals do not impair other users' connections. The plans are currently being voted on by representatives from the 28 EU member states and, if they are passed, will then be debated by the European Commission and the European Parliament. Only if an agreement between these two bodies and EU member states is reached will the proposals become law. ""neutrality is important [but] the question is how to define special services on top."" Speaking at the Mobile World Congress (MWC) in Barcelona, EU digital chief Günther Oettinger said that the rules might be agreed as early as summer this year. ""Access to the Internet and neutrality for our consumers is an important goal,"" The Wall Street Journal reports Mr. Oettinger as saying. ""The question is how to define special services on top."" telecoms say a ""light-touch"" is necessary Telecom operators welcomed the proposals, claiming that only a ""light-touch"" approach to net neutrality would allow the growth of the EU's ""digital single market"" — the plan to unify Europe's digital industry with shared laws for digital matters such as online payments and mobile data. Financial Times reports that the chief executives of both Deutsche Telekom and Vodafone argued at MWC that a tiered internet was necessary to ensure essential services such as connected cars and health care would not be impaired in the future. Liberal politicians within the EU strongly condemned the proposals, with the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Group (ALDE) commenting that the ""drafts that are circulating clearly demonstrate that Members States are more interested in defending the interests of their national telecom operators than creating real competition."" ""current proposals are ambivalent."" Marietje Schaake, an European MEP and a spokesperson for ALDE added: ""We need clearly defined net neutrality in Europe, to build a future proof digital single market. Current proposals are ambivalent and can lead to commercial practices that go against consumer interests, against innovative startups, and against fair competition in the digital economy."" It's not clear what the prospects of these proposals currently are, especially as they only exist in leaked forms.

In a tweet, Clinton made reference to the matter, and said she planned to release her email archives to the public. I want the public to see my email. I asked State to release them. They said they will review them for release as soon as possible.  State officials are expected to use official email accounts while in office for purposes of security and transparency, but Clinton was found to have ducked the rules, instead using a personal account run from a private email server to communicate with State Department colleagues, world leaders, and other third parties. Clinton has reportedly already handed over 55,000 pages of emails to the State Department, but it's not clear how many more emails remain unseen. The State Department responded to Clinton's tweet with a statement in which it said the release of the emails could take some time. Before being made public, governmental emails are routinely checked for classified or confidential information that is excised. ""The State Department will review for public release the emails provided by Secretary Clinton to the Department, using a normal process that guides such releases. We will undertake this review as soon as possible; given the sheer volume of the document set, this review will take some time to complete."" Clinton's tweeted promise goes some way to ensure transparency, but it doesn't explain why she decided to avoid using the official governmental email service in the first place. Other state officials have been caught out for using insecure public email services such as Gmail to conduct business, but by setting up a private email server registered to her home address and using it exclusively for four years, Clinton showed more forethought in her rulebreaking than some of her peers. A Clinton spokesperson said she had followed ""letter and spirit of the rules,"" but policy experts have made it clear that her actions were extraordinary. ""I can recall no instance in my time at the National Archives when a high-ranking official at an executive branch agency solely used a personal email account for the transaction of government business,"" Jason R.

Instead, Clinton operated her own email server traced to an internet service registered to the Clinton residence in Chappequa, New York, according to the Associated Press. The report does not say where the server itself was based. Clinton did not use an email address issued by the State Department while in office, which would have made it far simpler for the federal government to retain copies of her messages as is required under the Federal Records Act. Not your typical Gmail or Yahoo account Nor did Clinton use a personal Gmail or Microsoft account to conduct official state business, a move that's occasionally landed other US lawmakers in hot water. But even in those instances, politicians rarely use private accounts exclusively. With Clinton, everything went through her own private internet service, which in itself is sure to raise questions about how secure the email system was. How did encryption and other security mechanisms compare to what's offered by Google, Microsoft, or the federal government? In 2012, Clinton's email was reconfigured to use Google as a back end if the self-managed email system went down, the AP reported. (Just one year prior, Google publicly accused China of trying to hack into personal Gmail accounts belonging to senior members of US government, journalists, and other users.) Google was later replaced by MX Logic, an email provider that's now under McAfee. Clinton exclusively used the email address — hdr22@clintonemail.com — through the four years she served as state secretary under President Obama. During her tenure, ""aides took no actions to have her personal emails preserved on department servers,"" The New York Times said Monday. But two months ago, Clinton's team gave 55,000 pages worth of emails to the State Department. It is unclear how advisors curated her inbox to decide which emails would be forwarded to the National Archives and which would not. A Clinton spokesperson said that because she so often corresponded with other federal officials through their government-provided accounts, Clinton had ""every expectation they would be retained"" for future reference. Colin Powell, who served as Secretary of State under George W. Bush, used a personal email account in his communications with top officials both in the US and internationally. At that time, regulations around email preservation were much looser. Clinton's direct predecessor, Condoleezza Rice, rarely used email while holding the office. In the event she did, Rice used her government account. Current Secretary of State John Kerry similarly uses a government email address, ensuring his messages will be kept permanently. Clinton has not yet publicly discussed the issue or explained why a top-level cabinet member should be permitted to go it alone with a private email address. The State Department hasn't indicated that it's missing any emails from Clinton's tenure, but if not all of them have been handed over, requests to recover them in the future could run into Clinton's lawyers.",0.5741775681438248,0.4258224318561752,0.8670007847058768,505,5.3089108910891092,296,6.0844594594594597,0,0,"Policy & Law, US & World",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

It's set for release on May 25th, 2018. The Hollywood Reporter first reported the news. ""This is the first film we've worked on that seems like a good idea to begin with,"" Lord and Miller say in a statement. ""We promise to take risks, to give the audience a fresh experience, and we pledge ourselves to be faithful stewards of these characters who mean so much to us. This is a dream come true for us."" ""This is a dream come true for us."" The project will be written by Lawrence Kasdan (The Empire Strikes Back, The Force Awakens) and his son Jon Kasdan (Dawson's Creek). It's described as the story of ""how young Han Solo became the smuggler, thief, and scoundrel whom Luke Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi first encountered at Mos Eisley."" This indicates that it's actually a different project from the standalone film that was being directed by The Fantastic Four's Josh Trank. Trank left that project soon after Star Wars Celebration this year, with rumors indicating that he'd actually been kicked off the project. Lord and Miller's ascent into the heights of Hollywood has been nothing short of astounding. Early in their careers they worked on Clone High, and made the jump to features with Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs. Soon after that they directed the 21 Jump Street adaptation with Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill, and they've rocketed ever since. Jump Street was a surprise hit, trafficking on an affection for the source material as well as a knowing sense of self-awareness. That same take was amplified in The Lego Movie and 22 Jump Street. They've since created The Last Man on Earth with Will Forte, and are set to write and produce an animated Spider-Man film for Sony. What will we see at Comic-Con on Friday? Of course, with news like this breaking early in the week there's no other option but to look towards San Diego Comic-Con.

The app is breaking new ground for the franchise, which has largely stuck to the province of mobile games and activities to this point. This Star Wars incarnation is more of a clearinghouse, a one-stop shop for news, history, media, activities, and some trifles for series die-hards. Disney and Lucasfilm are also tying the app's release to their presence at this year's Comic-Con festivities, where fans can use the app to jump into an AR interaction with characters from the series' universe. I had the chance to field test the app yesterday afternoon, and while I enjoyed my time within it, I'm not yet convinced that it has the depth to merit sustained activity from casual fans. You can sign in using a Disney / ESPN / ABC account, which tripped me up for a second — I ended up excavating a username I haven't seen in years because it was tied to my email address, so you might have to recover your info in the same way. After getting in, you can select a theme (either droids, the light side, or the dark side) to customize the app's look and feel, and you're given access to its full suite of features. I'm told it feels like Alderaan here right now Those features are split down the middle between informational and interactive. In the former category, there's Star Wars-themed weather reports for your location — I'm told it feels like Alderaan here right now — news and video feeds that aggregate from the Star Wars website and official social media outlets, pieces of daily Star Wars history, and a countdown to December's The Force Awakens. These all feel necessary, but none of them are engaging, and it's hard to imagine someone adding a few extra clicks to their morning weather check just so they know which Star Wars planet is comparable. With that said, this portion of the app could quickly turn essential if it's used to break news as opposed to just collecting it. There's a precedent for that kind of move on Disney / Lucasfilm's part: Topps' Star Wars Card Trader app revealed new information about characters from The Force Awakens when it was released in March. The best parts of the app are the ones where you can either share stuff with friends or  bring the universe to life using your phone's features. The GIF and soundboard sections are robust, and GIFs are auto-copied to your clipboard for pasting into your message app of choice. (This worked well for me in a few tests.) You can't copy and paste bits from the soundboard, but you can make a collection of your favorites for easier access. The Star Wars selfies are also tailor made for sharing, offering a range of environments and characters. If you want to see yourself as a fighter pilot or as Princess Leia, this is your chance.   There are some fun AR activities, too: a Force Trainer mini-game that turns your phone into a lightsaber, and a poster that you can scan to create a virtual Stormtrooper or BB-8. The full-sized version is only available at Comic-Con for now, but I was able to scan the poster out of my Gmail tab and plop a little Stormtrooper on my keyboard. His range of motion and dialogue was somewhat limited, but hey: a Stormtrooper on your keyboard! You can try it for yourself using the poster below.   Disney and Lucasfilm are promising to keep the app fresh through new updates and features (including more unlockable AR characters), and I'm sure those updates will increase in frequency as The Force Awakens approaches. As it stands, the app makes for a fun diversion for serious and casual fans alike, even if the latter might not stick around for daily use.

The latest of these, confirmed yesterday ahead of this weekend's San Diego Comic-Con, will star a young Han Solo, and will explain ""how he became the smuggler, thief, and scoundrel whom Luke Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi first encountered at Mos Eisley."" As with the other Star Wars Anthology films announced so far — Gareth Edwards' Rogue One and the as-yet untitled Boba Fett movie (which might currently be in production limbo) — the Solo-centric story mines the original Star Wars trilogy rather than the prequels for characters and setting. That's surely for the best (nobody wants Jar Jar Binks Begins), but by using the new movies to fill in the gaps around the original trilogy, Disney is ensuring that it can keep the best of both worlds. Spoiler warning: minor discussion of the new Star Wars comics ahead. J.J. Abrams looks to be doing a good job with The Force Awakens, but no matter his efforts, it'll be difficult to design an antagonist for the movie as outright evil as the Galactic Empire, headed by the iconic Emperor Palpatine and Darth Vader. If Episode VII's First Order doesn't captivate in the same way the Empire did — if Adam Driver's Kylo Ren isn't as immediately memorable as a cackling raisin in a bathrobe and evil Samurai Dad — then the spinoffs need only break out the old stormtrooper armor to appeal to fans for whom the original trilogy is folklore, creating two routes by which Disney can guarantee eyeballs on its movie-making and merchandising machine. We might have already seen the company cross the streams between old and new: yesterday it was reported that Darth Vader will be making an appearance in Rogue One.  Leaning on existing characters also lends the Anthology movies wider appeal for people who might not consider themselves Star Wars nerds. But the tactic could conceivably have a downside — how do filmmakers Christopher Miller and Phil Lord stamp their own mark on characters set in stone across three much-loved movies? Already we've seen one director move on from an Anthology project, and Boba Fett, the bounty hunter Josh Trank was set to bring back to the big screen, is a far less concrete character in the Star Wars fiction than suave smuggler Solo. Solo is perfectly described by his introductory scene in the Mos Eisley cantina, a beautifully economic bit of storytelling that tells us almost everything we need to know about the character with just a few lines and a blaster. We know he's prideful, we know he thinks he's the galaxy's biggest badass, we know he likes to beat the odds, and we know he'll shoot first — or at least at exactly the same time. Everything else — his heart of gold, his smarmy charm, and his loyalty to his friends — is fleshed out by the end of A New Hope. Han Solo's character is perfectly described by his first scene in A New Hope Where Boba Fett has the murdered father, violent impulses, and brooding personality to support a gritty, Batman Begins-ish origin story, Han Solo doesn't fit the same mold. Fortunately, the filmmaking duo chosen for the gig are more than capable of making Solo's story fun, fresh, and funny. Christopher Miller and Phil Lord took 21 Jump Street, an almost-forgotten police procedural set in a ‘90s high school, and made it into a surprisingly clever and self-referential comedy. The appointment of Miller and Lord is more than just a safe set of hands for the spinoff: it's a good indication of the movie's tone. Chances are we can expect a caper rather than a consideration of the human (and non-human) condition. Solo's background, scrubbed partially clean by Disney's decision to do away with the Star Wars expanded universe, is still full of stories that Miller and Lord can expand on. The smuggler famously completed the Kessel run in less than 12 parsecs. Perhaps the movie will track his fabled attempt to move at unprecedented speed through the Maw, the mass of black holes that surround lumpy penal planet Kessel? Or perhaps it'll take us back further, show us how exactly Solo won the Millennium Falcon. That movie would introduce young Han to young Lando, a pairing that, if given the right actors, would be magnetic on screen. Or perhaps we'll go back even further, to Solo's youth, and work out how he earned the right to wear his Corellian blood stripes. Perhaps we'll even see him rescue Chewbacca, earning the Wookiee's lifelong loyalty in the process.   The movie may also star Han's recently introduced wife For now at least, the movie's plot is presumably fluid, but we can be sure about a few things. The Solo spinoff can't feature Princess Leia, or at least, can't feature her in a role in which she actually meets Han. Their first introduction is set up in A New Hope, and their trajectories are too different for them to bump into each other at the local tapcafe. Instead, we may see an appearance from a character introduced to the fiction just last month — Han's wife, Sana Solo. Neither Marvel nor Disney has yet to elaborate on the specifics of her relationship with Han, but she already seems his equal, having been able to track the notoriously slippery smuggler the length of the galaxy. Han and Chewie could conceivably shore up a 21 Jump Street-style buddy movie on their own, but when one of the buddies is a growling 7-foot carpet, dramatic exposition becomes a little trickier. Sana offers the opportunity for banter, for back and forth in the cockpit, for Han to loudly proclaim ""It's not my fault!"" at someone in particular when the hyperdrive fails again. But as the movie brings in the young Han Solo, it's a good bet we'll also see the end of the old. Maintaining two takes on the same character in theaters at around the same time could be difficult for audiences, and Harrison Ford, though still crashing into golf courses at the age of 72, may not have wanted to sign on for the grueling filming schedule of a new Star Wars trilogy. At least if the older Solo is heading out, he's got a while before he needs to vacate the Millennium Falcon's pilot chair — the Han Solo spinoff movie won't blast onto screens until May 28th, 2018.",0.517091639850475,0.482908360149525,0.18529711508294378,1103,4.7262012692656388,579,5.924006908462867,0,2,"Culture, Entertainment, Editorial, Film",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

First Feig provided a German Ghostbusters fan account with a too-detailed breakdown of the movie's proton pack props; now he's showing the world the latest version of the iconic Ecto-1 car. Feig tweeted a picture of the vehicle today, shortly after news came out that the new movie, which features an all-female squad of 'busters, had added The Wire's Michael K. Williams and Andy Garcia to the cast. Neil Casey is reportedly set to play the movie's villain. The first Ghostbusters' Ecto-1 borrowed the flowing, organic-looking chassis of a 1959 Cadillac Professional. The new vehicle looks boxier than that original, losing the Cadillac's tail fins, but maintaining its side-mounted ladder and array of sirens and lights. A second view, tweeted an hour later after a fan demanded to see the back of the car, shows the Ghostbusters logo and a more muted red-and-white color scheme. #whattheygonnadrive pic.twitter.com/bBLEhrfTEQ  @szewcik_james Okay. pic.twitter.com/sHkx1Soj6p  Feig has already faced a minor backlash from fans on Twitter who fear the new Ecto-1 is too different, but as shown by his obsessively detailed proton pack breakdown, the director has certainly pored through old Ghostbusters design documents. The new vehicle even includes a set of antennae — presumably for detecting ghosts to bust — the likes of which were festooned across Dan Ackroyd's early Ecto-1 concept drawings. More of a worry is the pace at which Feig is tweeting out key details from his reboot to try to maintain hype: at this speed, we'll know everything about the movie way before its scheduled premiere in 2016.",0.7033026583638213,0.29669734163617867,0.8201759261118952,279,5.1792114695340503,186,6.080645161290323,0,0,"Culture, Entertainment",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

He screams a lot. He publishes videos himself playing video games. He makes a lot of money doing so. The latest figure is $7.4 million, which comes by way of Swedish newspaper Expressen (via Engadget and Fusion). That shouldn't be too surprising — Kjellberg is the king of YouTube, after all. When we nominated him for The Verge 50 this past December, he had 32.6 million subscribers and 6.9 billion views; less than a year later, he's now up to 37.7 million subscribers and over 9 billion views. Assuming the $7.4 million figure is accurate, that comes out to less than 20 cents per subscriber. But even if you don't know who PewDiePie is or care about what he does, I encourage you to watch the video embedded above, published earlier today. In it, a reserved but charming Kjellberg talks directly to the camera about the report. He doesn't act defensive, and he doesn't scream; it feels honest and personable. ""People... thought it was unfair,"" he said. ""They thought I just sit on my ass all day and i just yell at the screen over here — which is true — but there's so much more to it.""  ""If you think someone's funnier, go refresh their videos over and over, because that's how we get paid."" This isn't the first time Kjellberg has addressed his income. When The Wall Street Journal published a piece last June about him making $4 million in 2013, he hosted a Reddit AMA, answering questions about income, charitable contributions, and fan interaction. And this is the part of PewDiePie's story that sometimes gets lost in all the big numbers. Love it or hate it, his success — like so many other YouTube personalities — isn't just in playing games but actually connecting and talking directly to an audience.

Both echoed the look and size of Apple's iPhone 6, and are still arguably among the best phones on the market. Now, just five months later Samsung is pushing one of those sleek-looking phones into phablet territory with the introduction of the Galaxy S6 Edge+. If you’ve held or even used an S6 Edge, you might be surprised at how easy it is to mistake the new, bigger version for its smaller predecessor. Samsung managed to fit a larger 5.7-inch version of the S6 Edge’s quad HD AMOLED screen in the new phone without drastically increasing the overall size of the device — the S6 Edge+ is just 12mm longer and 5mm wider than the S6 Edge. It’s even a hair thinner, measuring just 6.9mm compared to the 7.0mm-thick S6 Edge.     Everything else about the look and feel of the S6 Edge+ is remarkably similar. The glass body is ringed by metal, with volume buttons on the left and a sleep / power button on the right. There’s a headphone jack and speaker on the bottom of the phone, and the rear camera still bulges out, making it impossible to lay the phone flat on its back. Almost everything inside the phone is also the same, which isn’t necessarily a bad thing. The S6 Edge+ is powered by the same octa-core Exynos processor that made the original S6 line operate so fast (but with 4GB of RAM this time around). It runs Samsung's slightly altered version of Android 5.1 Lollipop. You’ll also find the same 16-megapixel sensor, which is one of the best cameras found on any phone, let alone just on Android devices. It’s hard to fault Samsung for wanting to stray from the design that attracted many glowing reviews, including our own. And, in fact, the changes that Samsung did make address two of our biggest problems with the quirky device. One is the battery: it’s slightly bigger this time around at 3,000mAh, but will recharge as fast as the one on the S6 Edge. It’s still not removable, but it’s a step in the right direction. The other is a small tweak to the software that could have a huge impact on how you use the phone. Samsung introduced the ""People Edge"" shortcut with the S6 Edge, which placed a tab on the side of the phone’s home screen, which let you set and access your most-used contacts. Now with the S6 Edge+ there’s also ""Apps Edge,"" which lets you quick-launch apps. A swipe on the shortcut tab will bring up whatever you most recently used, so if you want to just use it for app switching, you’ll never have to swipe past the contacts. The shortcut tab is no longer just a home screen feature, too — you can set it so that it shows up no matter where you are in the software. (You can reposition the small tab along the side of the screen, but you can’t change the size.) It makes it extremely easy to switch between apps, which is great, because it’s a bit hard to reach the entire 5.7-inch screen with just one hand. Another new feature coming to the S6 Edge+ and the Galaxy Note 5 is the ability to live stream on YouTube right from the native camera app. You can schedule streams or push them live on the spot, and you’re given the option to create a private, invite-only session or grab a public URL to share on your social media. The phones are capable of streaming up to 1080p at 60 frames per second, if you’re willing to spare the data. It’s a clear attempt at capturing some of the booming live-streaming video market, and will especially be a shot across the bow of the dominant mobile streaming app, Periscope. We really loved both versions of the Galaxy S6 that were released earlier this year, but the S6 Edge’s curved screen (and even the one on the Note Edge, for that matter) felt like a gimmick with little utility. The S6 Edge was an even harder sell when you factored in that it costs about $100 more than the regular S6. With the S6 Edge+, Samsung is offering more screen real estate while giving the oddball hardware just a bit more functionality. The Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge+ will be available on all of the major US carriers in black or gold alongside the new Galaxy Note 5 on August 21st. It comes in 32GB and 64GB configurations and will be priced a bit higher than the S6 Edge’s already lofty tag. Preorders start today. Update August 14th, 9:52AM: Samsung posted 128GB versions of the Galaxy Note 5 and the Galaxy S6 Edge+ on its website, but the company tells The Verge that they are not being offered at this time.

Once a staple on every smartphone produced, the physical keyboard has all but disappeared, showing up on a handful of BlackBerry devices that no one actually buys. Some companies, like the Ryan Seacrest-backed Typo, have tried to bring the hardware keyboard to modern phones, but without much success. Never content to sit on the sidelines, Samsung is now trying its hand at blending yesterday's hardware keyboard with today's modern, slab-style phones. A new accessory for the just-announced Galaxy Note 5 and S6 Edge+ brings back those tactile keys that so many people have long forgotten. Unlike the Typo keyboard, which communicated with the iPhone over Bluetooth and extended the length of the device to unwieldy proportions, Samsung's keyboard case snaps on top of the phone's display, effectively blocking half of the screen. The phone recognizes the keyboard and adjusts its user interface accordingly, shrinking everything to the top half of the screen. Keypresses are sensed by the screen underneath, eliminating the need for any batteries or Bluetooth pairing hassles in the keyboard itself. You can pop the keyboard on and off pretty easily, and if you want the full glory of an unobstructed display, you can snap it to the backside of the phone for storage.   It's definitely a novel and different idea, unlike anything I've seen before. Unfortunately, in the few minutes I spent demoing the keyboard, I didn't find it particularly easy to type on. The keys are not very well separated, and they kind of all blend together under my thumbs (the skeptic in me thinks that it was specifically designed to avoid looking like a BlackBerry keyboard and the inevitable lawsuits that would come with that), and I missed the conveniences of a virtual keyboard like tracing. But if you're a die-hard physical keyboard fan and don't want to venture into BlackBerry's world, Samsung might be your only ticket in town. Samsung couldn't tell me when the keyboard case would be available or how much it would cost, but I expect it will hit shelves around the same time as the Note 5 and the S6 Edge+. And can you really put a price on tactile keys?

The Note 5 is best described as a blend of the Galaxy S6 introduced earlier this year and the Note 4 from last year. It's a familiar shape and size, and it's likely to be the best Note Samsung's ever made. That's important for Samsung, because while it essentially defined the large smartphone (or phablet) market, it's seen its market share and profits get chewed away from both Apple and its larger iPhones as well as lower-end Android makers. The Galaxy S6 might be the everyman's smartphone from Samsung, but the Note line has always represented the pinnacle of Samsung's smartphone lineup, and it carries a lot of weight on its shoulders.  The Note 5 is still at the top of the heap of Samsung's lineup, but perhaps surprisingly, Samsung has recycled a lot of what we saw in the Galaxy S6. That's not necessarily a bad thing: the S6 brought along a speedy processor, great display, and outstanding camera, and all of those things are present in the Note 5. The Note 5 also gains the S6's design and materials, including a glass front and rear and a solid metal frame. But fans of the older Note phones will quickly notice that this step up in design and materials didn't come without cost: the removable battery and microSD card support are gone, as is any sort of waterproofing. In terms of specific specs, the Note 5 has the same octacore Samsung Exynos processor as the S6, though this time it's paired with 4GB of RAM. You can get a Note 5 with either 32 or 64GB of storage. The 3,000mAh battery is actually smaller than the one in last year's Note 4, but the Note 5 includes support for both wireless charging and quick charging this time around. The Note 5's camera is the same 16-megapixel unit with OIS as found on the S6, and its 5.7-inch Super AMOLED display has the same quad HD resolution. The screen is the same size as the Note 3 and Note 4 — apparently Samsung has settled on 5.7 inches as being the right size for its Note phones — but the overall dimensions of the phone are smaller in every way compared to last year's phone. It's ever so slightly shorter, narrower, and thinner than the Note 4, and that's evident when you pick it up and try to navigate it with one hand. The ergonomics are also aided by the curved back, which makes it easier to rest the phone in your palm. The Note 5 is still a large phone, without a doubt, but it feels less like one than ever before. The glass back does make the device slippery, however, and it's extremely prone to collecting fingerprints, regardless if it's the white or black color. Otherwise, the Note 5's design and build quality are just as high-caliber as the S6. Of course, it wouldn't be a Note if it didn't have Samsung's S Pen writing utensil, and sure enough, there's one located in a slot on the lower right of the phone. The new S Pen is longer and nicer than prior ones, and Samsung says it has improved the pressure sensitivity and writing performance over older models. There are a handful of new features too, such as the ability to pull the pen out of its cave and instantly start writing on the display without turning it on for quick notes. The rest of the Note's software should be familiar to anyone who's used a recent Samsung: it's Android 5.1 Lollipop with Samsung's TouchWiz interface and customizations on top of it. A couple of new features include the ability to live stream video from the camera app to YouTube and an improved app for connecting and managing the phone with a PC. Part of Samsung's move this year is to release the Note 5 ahead of Apple's fall iPhone launch, and you can actually preorder the phone from all four major US carriers starting today. It will be available in stores starting on August 21st, quite a bit earlier in the year than prior Note devices. Samsung says that each carrier will set pricing for the phone, but it will likely be priced around the same as prior Note devices, so you can expect to pay more for it than you would a Galaxy S6.

A confounding mix of banks, carriers, manufacturers, point-of-sale systems, and all the competing interests behind those businesses served to make paying with your phone unreliable. Those problems are finally beginning to fade away thanks to wider adoption and simpler back-end systems, but they're not gone yet. Even with Apple Pay, Google Wallet, and the soon-to-be-launched Android Pay, consumers can't be entirely sure that the little NFC icon they see at registers will guarantee that they can tap to pay. Samsung thinks it has a solution for that last problem, though, and predictably enough it's called ""Samsung Pay."" It transmits to almost any credit card reader To fix the problem of ensuring that more stores will take mobile payments, Samsung turned to a clever piece of technology that lets you pay at most any terminal where you can swipe a credit card. The trick comes thanks to a tiny coil that shoots out the same magnetic code that those readers normally get from your credit card. It's called ""Magnetic Secure Transmission,"" or MST; it's built into the Galaxy S6, S6 Edge, S6 Edge+, and Note 5. As with other mobile wallets, Samsung Pay can also let you pay with NFC and it will store loyalty cards and gift cards.   Back in February, Samsung acquired LoopPay, which developed the MST technology, and it wasted little time building it into its phones. LoopPay's co-founder, Will Graylin, came over to Samsung with the acquisition. He contends that the threshold at which users will begin to really use mobile payments is 80 percent — that is, 80 percent or more of the stores you visit need to be able to let you pay from your phone. Since Samsung Pay can work with most credit card terminals, Samsung believes that it has a jump start on the competition. Even though it's transmitting via a magnet, Samsung Pay seems to be set up to maintain security. It uses tokenization, which means that your actual credit card isn't sent, instead it uses a temporary one that Visa or Mastercard creates for you. It's also storing that information in a ""trusted execution environment,"" which keeps it isolated from any app that might want to access it. Apple Pay also keeps that information in a secure element, but Samsung was quick to point out that Android Pay doesn't (though it is also tokenized, so the risk is lessened).   To use Samsung Pay, you simply swipe up from the bottom bezel of your phone. It works from the home screen and, in a clever twist, when the phone's screen is off. A credit card pops up and you unlock it with your fingerprint. At that point, you can either pay with NFC (as with Apple Pay or Android Pay) or hold it up near the spot where you swipe a credit card. Unlike Apple Pay or Android Pay, which can begin their payments process when they detect NFC, Samsung wants its system to be initiated by the user first. That's why it's using that swipe-up motion to get it started: it's easy and works even if the phone is off. (Samsung's executives weren't particularly concerned about any confusion that could stem from the fact that the same gesture is used to activate Google Now on other Android phones.) Swipe up, unlock, tap, done Samsung trotted a group of reporters over to a Dunkin' Donuts in New York to show it off and it worked so simply that there's not a whole lot to say — except that the swipe on the point-of-sale station was a little awkwardly placed. Swipe up, unlock, tap, done. There are a few places where the MST technology won't work, namely any credit card reader that requires a physical trigger to activate the card read. That means that ATMs and gas pumps won't really work with Samsung Pay, but most stores will. Samsung says that it's not taking a transaction fee from card issuers, but it is acting as a conduit for some of your transaction information. It sends that along to your phone so you can get receipts, but Graylin says that ""we just pass it through"" and that Samsung isn't collecting that data. Samsung Pay is launching in Korea on August 20th and in the US on September 28th — though a software update which enables it will come sooner. It also says ""select US users"" will be able to take part in a beta test beginning on August 25th. The service is also planned for the UK, Spain, and China.

If you don't touch the money you've saved in a Digit account for three months, the company will throw a few cents your way: 5 cents for every $100 you saved, founder Ethan Bloch says. Because Digit is not a bank, it cannot legally offer users interest; ""rewards"" are the next best thing. And with the average US savings account bearing an 0.17 percent interest rate, your Digit rewards account might outperform a traditional bank account. If you haven't tried Digit yet, here's how it works. You sign up on the desktop web or on your phone and connect your current bank account. Digit creates a new savings account, backed by the FDIC, and manages it on your behalf. Every couple days, it will transfer a few dollars — $2 to $18 on average. When you need the money back, you send text messages to transfer it back into your checking account. (Aside from a rudimentary website, Digit is designed to be managed exclusively through texts.) And aside from the lack of traditional interest, Digit is free to use.   Digit won't say how many people are using it so far, but they have collectively saved $23 million — $1.3 million a week. On average, the service is designed to save about 5.5 percent of a person's salary. There have been some hiccups along the way — Chase Bank repeatedly disconnected its users' accounts from Digit — but for the most part I've found that Digit delivers what it promises. I've saved hundreds more dollars this year than I ever thought possible, and it's all been totally painless. Digit users have collectively saved $23 million In coming months, Digit will explore offering similarly automated services for other common financial challenges, including paying down debts and saving for retirement. And while Bloch wouldn't quite promise me that proper apps were on their way, he did tell me to stay tuned. Of all the services I've written about so far this year, Digit may have gotten the biggest response — it was the rare service that my friends read about and then actually signed up for. If they complained about anything, it was that Digit accounts don't earn interest.

The increase would bring the total amount devoted to antibiotic resistance to $1.2 billion. ""resistance could hamper our ability to perform a range of modern medical procedures"" Antibiotic resistance develops when bacteria encounters antibiotics in doses that aren't quite strong enough to kill them. Non-lethal contact with a drug is what allows bacteria to adapt and survive. When the bacteria can withstand our antibiotics, we have no way to cure infections — making major surgeries impossible, cutting short the lives of people with compromised immune systems, and turning even minor cuts into serious health risks. And the Obama administration is certainly aware of the threat. ""The rise of resistance could hamper our ability to perform a range of modern medical procedures from joint replacements to organ transplants, the safety of which depends on our ability to treat bacterial infections that can arise as post-surgical complications,"" according to a White House statement. In the new funding proposal, about $650 million will go to the NIH and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority to spur drug development, reports The Washington Post. Another portion of the funding, about $280 million, will be used to curb the over-prescribing of antibiotics in humans (about 50 percent of people who take antibiotics don't actually need them). Moreover, the Defense Department and the Department of Veterans Affairs will get a total of $163 million to combat antibiotic-resistant infections in settings that cater to veterans. The White House's funding proposal appears to be a follow-up to a five-year plan it announced in September, aimed at slowing the spread of resistant bacteria. The plan directed the Department of Health and Human services to come up with regulations requiring hospitals to set up antibiotic management programs. It also included the formation of a task force that is supposed to deliver a fully formed course of action by February 15th. In addition, it laid out incentives to pharmaceutical companies to try to kick-start drug development — but it mostly ignored the role of antibiotics in food production.  $1.2 billion pales in comparison to the $4.9 billion that goes to cancer research Today's announcement doesn't ignore the main consumers of antibiotics —  80 percent of antibiotics in the US are used on animals. $77 million will go to the Agriculture Department to develop  alternatives to antibiotics used in farming. Another $47 million will be dedicated to evaluating new antibiotics — antibiotics like the newly discovered teixobactin,  for instance — and monitoring antibiotic use in livestock production. Doubling of the budget to fight antibiotic resistance might seem impressive at first blush, but $1.2 billion pales in comparison to the $4.9 billion that goes  toward the National Cancer Institute each year. However, doubling the budget for antibiotics bucks the trend of declining research money; the US spending on science has slumped between 2004 and 2012. Particularly hard-hit were ""proof-of-concept"" studies, the early stage research that often focuses on new drugs — like new antibiotics.

According to China's Global Times newspaper, the incident occurred during a 28-person banquet at a Shenzhen restaurant last week that was attended by several senior police officials. Three journalists from the Southern Metropolis Daily newspaper attended the dinner undercover and reported that another attendee brought two cases of yellow wine and a giant salamander, which he said was bred in captivity. The giant salamander is listed as a ""critically endangered"" species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, and its population has declined dramatically in recent decades, largely due to human consumption. Some practitioners of traditional Chinese medicine believe the amphibian has therapeutic properties, though there is no evidence to support their claims.

The clip above was created using a new ultra high-speed camera capable of detecting single photons at a time — the smallest amount of light possible. To create the video, researchers from the Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh in the UK recorded 2 million laser pulses over a 10 minute period, aggregating individual collisions of photons with air particles to map the laser’s entire flight path. The new camera is so accurate that it shows the shape of the laser pulse ""This is the first time we’ve looked at light just passing by,"" lead researcher Genevieve Gariepy tells The Verge. ""Usually you have to see light reflecting off things."" In the case of lasers, observing the light is even more difficult as the photons are all moving in the same direction in a tightly focused beam. You only see the light from a laser when it bounces off an object or when something like smoke or gas is blown over it, giving the photons more particles to collide with. Gariepy explains that slightly smeared look of the laser in the video — a little like watching the aurora borealis in slow motion — shows just how precise the camera is. ""The pulse has a shape: it’s not just a rectangle moving through the air.""   The experiment is a step forward from research published in 2011 in which MIT physicists successfully recorded light pulses passing through a Coke bottle. The same scientists worked on this new experiment, and Gariepy explains that this process is quicker than the older work (taking 10 minutes to record instead of one hour) and uses a camera no bigger than a digital compact, while the MIT apparatus was projector-sized. ""They also had to fill the bottle with water and milk [to record the laser], meaning that some of the light bounced off those particles,"" says Gariepy, who adds that the new camera may not capture as many frames per second, but it is ""a lot more sensitive, allowing us to see the light bouncing off air molecules."" Technology like this could help us create cameras that can see around corners The camera itself only records 1024 pixels in a 32 by 32 grid, but Gariepy says it paves the way for practical applications in the future. Being able to record photons this accurately offers two new channels of data, she says, spatial and temporal. The temporal information can be used to study dynamic processes that happen very fast while the spatial data could be used to see around corners by recording photons bouncing off hidden objects and returning to the camera. ""It’s the same principle as LIDAR but more sensitive,"" says Gariepy. She explains that while work has already been done in this area (see the video below from 2012), the new camera is a step forward in terms of portability. ""Right now it’s just plugged into my computer, but it could be used by just taking it outside and recording movies for yourself.""

Both SpaceX and Boeing have completed the first milestones in their plans to send humans into space from US soil for the first time in years. SpaceX has completed the first certification milestone in its CCP commitment, and will spend much of 2015 testing abort solutions for its formerly cargo-only Dragon capsule. (Abort procedures are more critical in crewed missions.) A launchpad abort will be tested in the next two months at Cape Canaveral, and an in-flight abort test will follow ""later this year,"" according to SpaceX President and COO Gwynne Shotwell. Uncrewed missions to the ISS with the new capsule will start in 2016, and the company is still working out the makeup of its first test flight crew. ""I don't ever want to have to write another check to Roscosmos."" The CCP was started after the shuttle program was put to rest in 2011. Last April, NASA announced it wouldn't work with Russia any longer when it came to transporting American astronauts to the International Space Station. Instead, NASA awarded contracts to SpaceX and Boeing to build this new fleet of crewed spacecraft back in September. ""I don't ever want to have to write another check to Roscosmos,"" NASA's administrator Charles Bolden said during today's press conference. As of right now, the CCP should allow for an average cost of $58 million per seat, as opposed to the average of $70 million per seat it was costing the agency to fly with the Russians. SpaceX's goal is to fly over 50 Falcon 9 missions before attempting the first crewed launch in early 2017. Those missions will accommodate four crew members with space for cargo. The company will operate these CCP missions similarly to its cargo missions. That means the mission control centers, flight simulators, and other flight capabilities will be located at both Johnson Space Center and at the company's base in Hawthorne, CA.   The company is also working on outfitting its Dragon capsule with propulsive landing, Shotwell said, which could improve reusability by dispensing with the need to splash down in water. Instead, the capsule would land right at Johnson Space Center, using rockets on the bottom to help control the descent. That's not the only new technology the company is working on. It hopes to outfit its Falcon 9 rockets with wings and retrorockets so they can land on autonomous barges in the ocean. Boeing will launch the first crewed mission Commercial Crew Program Manager Kathy Lueders said that the first crewed mission in 2017 will belong to Boeing despite the fact that SpaceX already has a working spacecraft. To fill that first mission, the astronaut office is looking at naming a ""small cadre"" of astronauts that would follow both companies. The first crew will be selected from that group, which will be named ""before long,"" according to Johnson Space Center director Ellen Ochoa. Boeing has completed the first two certification milestones for its CST-100 spacecraft. NASA has signed off on parts of its commercial crew operation, including designs for the control center, training systems, flight simulators, and software. Boeing has also started building its crew access tower on the Atlas V launchpad, and that construction will continue in between uncrewed Atlas V launches. The first test hardware for Boeing's spacecraft will be delivered to Kennedy Space Center next month, and the first hardware for the actual crewed vehicle will be assembled later in the year. The initial crewed test flight will contain one Boeing test pilot and one NASA astronaut. In the meantime, Boeing is also spending time refurbishing the Kennedy Space Center facility that will be used for constructing its spacecraft. Both capsules are designed to be reusable The CST-100 will undergo a critical design review in March, and if approved, will let the company launch ""full-bore"" into manufacturing, according to VP and General Manager of Boeing Space Exploration John Elbon. Boeing's spacecraft can fit up to seven crew members, and is also being designed with reusability in mind. According to Elbon, the plan is for the capsule to be recovered, refurbished, and reused up to 10 times. When asked how this all fits in with the 2016 budget, Bolden said he's ""very optimistic."" ""Congress has, I think, kind of started to understand the critical importance of commercial crew and cargo. They've seen, as a result of the performance of our providers, that this is not a hoax. It's not a myth. It's not a dream,"" he said.

It’s almost showtime: Comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko, the target of ESA’s Rosetta mission, is finally shedding its outer coating of dust. This event has never been directly observed before. Particles collected by Rosetta will offer new information on the composition of comets, according to a study in the journal Nature. This shedding also sets the stage for the reawakening of the Philae lander as the comet moves closer to the Sun and is exposed to more sunlight. Comets get dusty in the outer solar system — but not because dust lands on them Comets are made up of a mixture of rock, dust, frozen gas, and water ice. Even when a comet is traveling through the colder outer regions of the solar system, these frozen elements sublimate — changing directly from a solid to a gas. This process isn't forceful enough to dislodge any solids on the surface though, and so the comet’s exterior becomes gradually drier and dustier as the ice disappears. When the comet draws closer to the heat of the sun, the dust that had congealed on the surface is blown off by more forceful sublimation. Soon, the dust mantle will be gone entirely to reveal 67P’s icy surface, reports Rita Schulz, lead author of the paper and former Rosetta project scientist. The process is predicted to take about four weeks based on previous observations of the comet.  Rosetta with 67P in the background: that's close for a comet. ""Because we have never before had a spacecraft at a comet so far away from the Sun, this is the first time we can determine the properties of the mantle,"" says Schulz. She explains that while previous cometary flybys like the 2004 Stardust mission have taken samples from comets after the shedding occurs, this time scientists will have front row seats. ""It’s imminent, it’s on the verge of doing it right now,"" says Schulz. 67P's crust dust contains the parents of interplanetary dust particles Samples collected so far have been high in sodium and appear porous or ""fluffy"" under Rosetta’s microscope cameras. Many shattered into pieces when they hit the 1cm by 1cm target plate on the spacecraft, suggesting that they were fragile and had not been glued together by water ice. ""From this we can conclude that the dry dust particles that we see in the dried out crust of the comet are actually the parents of interplanetary dust particles,"" says Schulz. ""These particles are everywhere — the solar system is filled with them. They’re what make shooting stars, for example."" The work by Schulz and her colleagues corroborates a string of reports published last week. One of these confirmed the lack of ice on the comet’s surface (caused by the same low-level sublimation that created its dusty exterior), while another observed the ratio of gas to dust being expelled. However, even better for the scientists involved, is that as 67P moves closer to the Sun it's getting more and more sunlight — good news for the Philae lander, which is currently shut down due to insufficient power from its solar panels. ""This means the solar cells might unfreeze and recharge and the lander might say, ‘Hello, I’m back!’"" says Schulz. ""We believe that this may happen within the next few months.""",0.39276739124293647,0.6072326087570635,0.8575508824798205,559,4.8801431127012522,316,5.8639240506329111,0,2,Science,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Children who do share genetic mutations, however, also tend to display the same types of symptoms. The findings suggests that the condition may be related to different factors, even in siblings. And figuring out what those factors are for each individual child, the researchers say, may be important for diagnosis — as well as management. autism may be related to different factors, even in siblings.  ""We anticipated that, more often than not, there would be shared inheritance"" in siblings, Stephen Scherer, a geneticist at the University of Toronto and a co-author of the study, told The New York Times. ""That wasn't the case."" Approximately 1 in 68 children have some form of autism spectrum disorder, and the disorder is five times more common in boys. There's no cure for autism, and taking care of a child with autism spectrum disorder can be costly. The CDC estimates that parents spend about $17,000 more per year when caring for a child with autism than they do for a child without it, and a large chunk of that cost goes toward services like therapy, education, and caregiver time. That's why figuring out the best way to manage a child's autism is essential; the right health management strategy can make things a lot easier for everyone involved. In the study, researchers sequenced the genomes of 170 people with autism spectrum disorder. Each of the participants belonged to families in which two children have autism. They found that close to 70 percent of the siblings didn't share common autism-associated mutations. In those cases, the siblings also tended to display different symptoms, whereas children that did share genetic mutations were more likely to share symptoms, like habits and social skills. The study's results are also important for families with one sibling because it means that assessing a couple's risk of having another child with autism isn't as clear cut.  This means that assessing a couple's risk of having another child with autism isn't as clear cut ""This study makes us step back and realize we're not necessarily going to get as much predictive value out of genetic mapping as we thought, ""Helen Tager-Flusberg, a developmental neuroscientist at Boston University who didn't participate in the study, told The New York Times. Given the results, doctors may want to complete full assessments of each child's genome ""when determining the role of genetic factors in risk- or health-management strategies,"" the researchers write; relying on the oldest sibling's genome might not be enough. The size of the study was small, however, so it's possible that a bigger sample of siblings might alter the results. Moreover, the researchers only focused on the analysis of 100 previously identified genetic mutations. If other important mutations are identified later on, that may affect the results. The researchers now hope to look into a much larger number of families. Should the study hold up, it will serve as another example of autism's genetic complexity.",0.592793058709404,0.407206941290596,0.1793445997923422,535,5.1383177570093457,291,5.934707903780069,0,0,Science,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

On Tuesday, new Reddit CEO Steve Huffman — Ohanian's other half — announced that the company would reveal possible changes to how it deals with some of the site's nastiest communities. In the announcement, Huffman claimed that ""neither Alexis nor I created Reddit to be a bastion of free speech,"" setting Reddit's censorship-averse zealots off in a renewed frenzy, and with good reason; Ohanian in particular has extolled Reddit as a bastion of free speech. In a comment left on Huffman's announcement, Wong attacks Huffman's claim, alleging that he was perfectly willing to eradicate controversial content in the past. ""Back when I was running things, if there was anything racist, sexist, or homophobic I'd ban it right away,"" Huffman allegedly told Wong at the height of controversy during Wong's tenure as CEO. In fact, Wong claims that Reddit's leaders have been pushing for some time to ban the site's most controversial communities, and that Pao, ironically, was the one keeping them alive. ""The most delicious part of this is that on at least two separate occasions, the board pressured [Pao] to outright ban all the hate subreddits in a sweeping purge,"" Wong wrote. ""She resisted, knowing the community, claiming it would be a shitshow,"" Wong continued, claiming that Pao was inclined to uphold the policies Wong put in place. (For more on those policies, see Wong's barn burner of a blog post from last September: ""Every man is responsible for his own soul."") And why is this so ""delicious?"" Only because Pao has been the subject of monstrous rage from a coalition of Reddit users who made her out to be an apocalyptic tyrant of censorship.  ""She is literally Silicon Valley's #1 feminist hero."" Wong claims that Pao would have been the perfect defender for Reddit's trolls especially considering her recent legacy as a gender discrimination crusader. ""What all the white-power racist-sexist neckbeards don't understand is that with her at the head of the company, the company would be immune to accusations of promoting sexism and racism,"" Wong wrote. ""She is literally Silicon Valley's #1 feminist hero, so any 'SJWs' would have a hard time attacking the company for intentionally creating a bastion (heh) of sexist/racist content."" That assumption is obviously debatable, but Wong seems unambiguous about a more crucial point: Reddit's good old boys' club won't be the mighty defender of unlimited speech that the site's revolting users had hoped for. ""Now she's gone,"" Wong wrote, ""and [Huffman] has the moral authority as a co-founder to move ahead with the purge. We tried to let you govern yourselves and you failed, so now the man is going to set some rules. Admittedly, I can't say I'm terribly upset."" As for his own future prospects? Wong isn't terribly optimistic. ""I'm probably unhireable now,"" he wrote. ""I'm pretty sure no one will ever hire me as CEO or any other executive position again.""",0.5392669173393778,0.4607330826606222,0.8120455434923679,571,5.028021015761821,334,6.068862275449102,0,0,"Culture, Web",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Addressing the Intelligent Transport Society today, CEO Mary Barra said a new Cadillac model equipped with what the company calls Super Cruise, a semi-automatic system that enables hands-free driving on highways whether you're traveling fast or stuck in traffic, will go on sale in around two years. Barra calls Super Cruise ""an advanced, highly automated driving technology"" that lets the driver ""take a break from the wheel and pedals and let the car do the work.""  ""Take a break from the wheel and pedals and let the car do the work.""  Also set to hit the market in two years is GM's first car equipped with V2V (vehicle-to-vehicle) technology. The 2017 Cadillac CTS will be able to communicate with other V2V cars and infrastructure to help reduce crashes and congestion. Barra compared the technology to active traffic management projects that are up and running in various parts of the world, but believes the concept has the potential to be ""much more impactful"" if the cars themselves were communicating with the roads and each other. GM's initiatives are less ambitious than projects like Google's futuristic, fully-automated self-driving car, but they also have much more likelihood of making it to market through the tangled web of regulation.

And that's something that GM's CEO believes will happen.

A particularly quiet and environmentally friendly one, granted, but a workaday four-door nonetheless.  In Russia, on the other hand, a Model S attracts the attention of pretty much everyone. Tesla doesn’t do business there, so when Dmitry Grishin — the wealthy 35-year-old entrepreneur behind internet mega-portal Mail.ru — navigated hell and high water to bootleg one into Moscow, his hard-fought prize made the cover of Автомобили magazine. Over 600 of the 3,000 employees at his company signed up to test drive the car in a rented lot. “They’re all geeks, programmers,” Grishin says. “There are a lot of technology enthusiasts here. I see many people… you know, I have a huge amount of people in Moscow who just try to come to me to ask to drive the car. Many friends, technology entrepreneurs.”    Most people would bristle at the thought of a never-ending queue of people waiting to drive their personal car, but not Grishin. In fact, he’s probably Tesla’s biggest cheerleader in Russia, having navigated five months of ordering, waiting, transporting, paperwork, and red tape, just because he really wanted a Model S. ""First, what I did, I created a small team of people who helped me to bring the Tesla to Moscow, because we have logistics, legal stuff, how we cross the Russian border, and all this stuff."" (Yes, a small team.) He’s not sure if he had the very first Model S in the country — there are many rich, motivated people there, after all — but he knows it’s one of the first.    Grishin’s journey started in Amsterdam last January, where he ordered the car (when I ask him how he configured it, ""full"" is his one-word answer). After taking delivery in mid-May, he spent three weeks moving it through the Netherlands, Germany, and onward to the Russian border, where the fun with customs began. ""It was very funny stuff, because pretty much they don’t have this car in their databases,"" he chuckles. ""If you see some policeman who see the car driving, they spend a lot of time looking at it. It’s a very fun exercise for them to see how this works: ‘Is it really true? They’re driving without gasoline?’"" ""I put Tesla Model S in Russian databases,"" he says, ""Next time people will bring it to Russia, it will be a little easier."" By the time the car was safely in Grishin’s hands in Moscow, he’d paid ₽6.5 million for it — roughly $180,000. That compares to about $110,000 for a fully-optioned Model S P85 in the United States. Yet Russia — and Moscow in particular — is more EV-friendly than you might think: Grishin says that a February law change eliminated a 15 percent auto import tax for fully electric vehicles. In Moscow’s city center, a notoriously difficult and expensive place to park, EVs park free. Nissan Leafs are available in the country, but Tesla’s aggressive international expansion hasn’t yet found its way to Red Square. ""I spent a lot of time talking with Tesla Europe, saying, ‘Guys, I’m ready to bring Tesla to Russia. I’m the owner of one of the biggest news portals in Russia, so we can do a lot of promotion. I’m a big fan of the car,’"" Grishin says. ""They’re not saying no, they’re just saying they’re in the process of reviewing things for future expansion. And you know, I really believe it’ll be really cool if they can come to Moscow. I can help, I can personally invest money to help them build this. I believe it’s a really good car, and a big market.""  Of course, getting the car into Russia is one thing; charging and maintaining it there is quite another. He's installed three chargers in his company's parking lot, but none at home — with his roughly 25-mile commute, he doesn't need one there. He can’t find a company that will insure the car against damage, because no one in the country knows how to fix it. If he has minor problems, he says he'll just try importing parts and taking care of it locally. For major issues, he's confident he can ferry the car to Stockholm via St. Petersburg on a single charge, as long as he uses trains and boats along the way. Because Tesla’s cellular data connection doesn’t work in Russia, Grishin connects the car to his iPhone in hotspot mode whenever he’s driving. Grishin, who compares the Model S’s importance to that of the original Apple iPhone, isn’t shy about his nerdery. In my half-hour chat with him, he mentions his frustration that Google doesn’t support his Glass in the Russian market and gets audibly excited when talking about upcoming plug-in hybrid cars from Porsche and BMW. Besides helming Mail.ru, he recently founded Grishin Robotics, a venture capital firm focused (naturally) on robots. But today, it’s not internet portals or automatons that has this new-age Russian multimillionaire excited — it’s evangelizing electric cars in one of the last industrialized markets in the world to get them. ""Some are saying that maybe Tesla is buying me off, working on commission because I make so much noise about Tesla in Russia. I say no, I just really want to help. I hope somehow it will help bring Tesla to Russia.""

The new policy, which is retroactive and covers existing owners, allows for ""unlimited miles"" to be driven in that time. So as long as you're within those 8 years, Tesla will service your car under warranty at no cost if there should be an issue with the drive unit. You may be on the hook for problems elsewhere, and the updated and far more generous warranty only applies to the 85 kWh Model S. Musk says this is Tesla's ""most popular car by far."" Musk wants buyers feeling even more confident about their purchase Prior to today, the Model S had a 4-year, 50,000 mile warranty that could optionally be upgraded to an extended warranty covering 8 years and 100,000 miles for an added cost of $4,000. Musk is no longer happy with that approach. ""In hindsight, this should have been our policy from the beginning of the Model S program,"" he wrote on the automaker's blog today. ""If we truly believe that electric motors are fundamentally more reliable than gasoline engines, with far fewer moving parts and no oily residue or combustion byproducts to gum up the works, then our warranty policy should reflect that."" He's also giving investors a heads up that the change will ""have a moderately negative effect on Tesla earnings in the short term."" But Musk thinks any downsides will be short-lived and that Tesla will come out better for having made this decision. ""By doing the right thing for Tesla vehicle owners at this early stage of our company, I am confident that it will work out well in the long term. The timing isn't entirely coincidental; Edmunds recently published a report that called the reliability of Model S into question. Over the course of 17 months, Edmunds had to make an abnormally high number of maintenance visits to fix a wide variety of issues.

One of the neatest features is something we've known about for some time now; with its latest mobile app update, Tesla gave customers the ability to start up Model S using only a smartphone and password. Now, the firmware has been updated to support this functionality on the car's end. Both smartphone startup and the calendar require the most recent version of Tesla's app for Android and iOS. Other improvements include location-based air suspension, which allows the Model S to remember areas where you've previously needed high ride heights and adjust the air suspension automatically whenever you're driving over those roads (or tackling a difficult driveway) again.

A trickle of devices ranging from fitness trackers, to smartwatches, to identification tools are rapidly turning into a flood, with many more expected for 2014. What separates this category from so many other forms of technology is how personal it is — not only are wearables tools, they also act as ornaments or jewelry. Design plays a crucial role — if something is ugly, unattractive, or just uncomfortable, are most people likely to wear it everywhere they go? Gadi Amit is the principal designer and one of the founders of NewDealDesign, an award-winning San Francisco firm that has designed a number of consumer products over the past decade. Most recently, NewDealDesign was responsible for the line of Fitbit fitness trackers (including the new Fitbit Force) and the Lytro light-field camera. Amit and his firm have been working hard at building devices that answer those key questions: how do we make a device that is functional, attractive, and durable all at the same time?    ""At NewDeal, part of our method is the contrarian design — you thought you wanted to see this, but how about that too?"" says Amit. If a client says they want a specific design or product, NewDeal will give them what they want, but also provide an alternative design that they might not have considered or might not even like. Typically, a gadget company might want NewDeal to build them a gadget, but that doesn’t always work when it comes to wearables. ""There’s obviously core technology that we’re trying to get into the product, but sometimes the human qualities push back."" ""It’s a very interesting dialogue — there’s obviously core technology that we’re trying to get into the product, but sometimes the human qualities push back,"" notes Amit. For example, every feature has a tradeoff: is a larger battery truly useful in a wearable device if it no longer makes the product comfortable for the average person to wear? NewDeal also gives care and attention to how the products actually behave when they are worn or used by people. ""We don’t think that objects need to always declare to the world their state,"" says Amit, referring to the basic, simple displays he’s used on the Fitbit and other devices. ""We want to have products that are very much at ease, flowing into your work and lifestyle, rather than being somewhat shouty."" Since wearables are objects that we actually wear, they can’t just look like a typical gadget. As with nice watches and fine pieces of jewerly, they need to posses an allure and inspire a sense of emotional connection with the wearer. A wearable device should be designed well enough that you would want to wear it even if it didn’t have any electronics in it.  A few prototypes used in the design of Fitbit devices. ""If you use something for five years it is better than it breaking every few months,"" notes Amit. ""If you create awesome products that people love, they will keep them and maybe you will save a few upgrade cycles in that way."" Though there is a constant pressure to have the latest and greatest, the longer people keep their gadgets and use them, the better it is for the environment. Amit posits that one such solution could be to have a constant ""shell"" or exterior design, and then upgrade the internal components as new technology and capabilities are released. But it’s not just hardware designers that are responsible for the rapid hardware upgrade-cycles we have today. ""People lament that their devices are being discarded and changed, but the problem is actually software compatibility more than hardware in many cases,"" says Amit. ""We should strive as an industry for a seven- or ten-year guaranteed performance on devices, so if I have a great design, it can be in the market for nearly 10 years."" ""We should strive as an industry for a seven- or ten-year guaranteed performance on devices."" As wearable technology becomes a larger and larger part of our daily lives — Amit predicts that in just a few years, we could be wearing up to 10 different devices on a regular basis — their design becomes more and more paramount. It’s no longer just important to have the best technology in a product — it has to look and feel good. Good design has the potential to make us both fall in love with our gadgets and help curb the disposable mentality that has been fostered by the rapid pace of technological innovation. But it will take the entire industry to really get us there. As Amit asks at the end of our conversation, ""How can we get design, and hardware, and software, and cloud services, [to all] stay relevant for seven or ten years as a good target?""",0.7607317267831464,0.23926827321685362,0.16362991283673053,822,4.8041362530413627,394,6.063451776649746,1,0,"Design, Tech, Interview, Report",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

And if you can think of 30 reasons not to build such a thing, Motorola’s designers and engineers can probably come up with 300. But against all odds, they're doing it. The ""why"" of Project Ara is an inspiring vision of a more sustainable and democratic smartphone. Motorola wants to lower barriers to entry for new companies and consumers alike while helping to build an ecosystem of versatile devices that don’t get discarded as soon as any one component breaks down. The same flexibility that you gain from having an interchangeable battery can be magnified if everything from the display and cameras to the applications processor and wireless radios is also user-upgradeable. By swimming upstream against the current of ever-greater integration and consolidation, Motorola’s venture aims to produce ""a phone worth keeping."" Those words come from Dave Hakkens, the creator of Phonebloks, a grassroots community united by the desire to see modular phones become a reality. Having earned will.i.am’s unequivocal approbation earlier this month, Phonebloks is today getting a much more important boost from Motorola’s embrace of the concept. Hakkens envisions the practicalities of building a modular phone as a mix of Etsy and a software app-store. Hardware developers will offer up their wares and buyers will pick and choose the particular specs of their desired phone. Moto’s underpinning the whole thing by developing the first prototype device, and later providing the sweetly titled endos (short for ""endoskeletons"") upon which to mount your various components. Those will be joined by the release of Module Developer’s Kits and prizes for the most accomplished designs.  The road from concept to reality goes via YouTube and Reddit Hakkens tells The Verge that his major contribution has been to galvanize an otherwise dormant desire among smartphone users for longer-lasting, more flexible devices. His initial concept video was picked up by Reddit and clocked up over a million views within its first 24 hours on YouTube. ""The first idea was to gather 500 people,"" says the Dutchman, but that goal was surpassed within moments. The concept’s viral popularity did more than just bring phonebloks.com down. It afforded Hakkens the opportunity to talk to big companies about collaborating on making Phonebloks a reality. He names Nokia, Intel, Qualcomm, Sennheiser, Jolla, Ubuntu, Firefox, and ZTE among the parties expressing interest, but ultimately chose Motorola for two key reasons. ""They are very good at technical development, I’m not. I have the support of this large community."" Firstly, Moto has been making phones for over 40 years and, as Hakkens puts it, ""They are very good at technical development, I’m not."" The other key attraction is Google’s ""open way of thinking,"" which will be evident in the way Motorola and the Phonebloks community work together on Project Ara. The Phonebloks website and community, now numbering over 900,000 supporters, will serve as a gathering place where ideas can be shared and collaboration between individuals organized. Hakkens describes it as a more structured form of an online forum — where it’s not just a Wild West of random ideas, but good designs are voted on and then passed along to the engineers at Motorola. Keeping this dialog going between the big company driving the project and the people contributing to it will be Phonebloks’ key role going forward. The openness of the entire project, both from Motorola and Phonebloks, is admirable. There’s no reason, for example, why other companies who make a similarly compelling pitch can’t be included, with Hakkens saying that ""the more companies involved in the project the better."" He also points out that Motorola is taking an unprecedented step in letting the public in on this project at such an early stage.  Typically, concept development is handled entirely behind closed doors — and Moto did have some modular handset designs brewing behind the scenes before partnering up with Phonebloks — but it was the popularity of this campaign that convinced the company to open up its efforts. Motorola is responsible for developing and standardizing the basic spec of the Phonebloks platform. It’ll then make all the necessary information available online so that hardware developers can pick it up and start building their own blocks and growing the ecosystem. Most importantly for Hakkens, working with Motorola ""so people can have an influence on the development process is really unique."" Remember Modu? Neither does anyone else While undeniably energizing and stirring, the Phonebloks vision still feels utopian. When asked about cost projections or how the module store would operate, Hakkens describes those practicalities as ""the next next step."" ""A nice next step is to figure out,"" he says, ""whether it is even possible, because no one’s ever really tried it before."" The exact Phonebloks concept hasn’t been tried, that’s true, but modular handsets have an ignoble history of sparking short bursts of interest before flaming out. The most recent such example was the Modu, a tiny, no-frills phone that plugged into various jackets to perform higher-order functions. It suffered from exactly the issue that threatens Project Ara today — a misalignment between the cost of extra modules and accessories and the price buyers are willing to pay. Scott Bicheno of Strategy Analytics worries about performance and cost disadvantages relative to fully integrated smartphones and raises the specter of a complacent marketplace, ""with the mass-market likely to adopt an 'if it ain’t broke don’t fix it' view on messing around with components."" Still, these and other projects like Sony's QX lenses tap into a rich vein of unsated demand for modularity among smartphone owners. We want user-replaceable batteries and screens and chips because we tend to get attached to our devices. It’s emotionally easier to swap out a malfunctioning part than throw away the phone on which you composed your most heartfelt love missives or best haiku. And, even more importantly, it’s a less wasteful way to keep upgrading to the latest electronics.  ""A nice next step is to figure out whether it is even possible."" Today, Phonebloks is making its big social splash with a Thunderclap — an automated, synchronized message posted to supporters’ Twitter, Facebook and / or Tumblr feeds — and looking to expand the community that has already helped turn Dave Hakkens’ wishful concept into a real project from a major phone maker. With nearly a million people signed up for the Thunderclap, it’s estimated that the social reach of that info blast will exceed 379 million. It’s a crowdfunding campaign where the only contribution you’re required to make is that of your voice. Tell the world you want ""a phone worth keeping"" and maybe, just maybe, the pieces will fit together to make it a reality.",0.6403811523026305,0.3596188476973695,0.17605553057563728,1179,5.2137404580152671,645,6.4031007751937983,0,0,"Design, Google, Mobile, Tech, Concepts, Report",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

The 17 is a compact speaker that can be placed anywhere in a room or mounted on a wall, while the 19 is an accompanying subwoofer. The 18 is a floor- or wall-mounted vertical speaker that takes its inspiration from the the BeoLab 8000, B&O's most iconic speaker design. All three speakers use the WiSA wireless transmission standard, which B&O says offers the best wireless transmission and reliability with the least amount of latency.

The BeoLab 17 features a single-piece, extruded aluminum shell, while the BeoLab 19 has a dodecahedron (12-sided) shape that is meant to better disperse bass without coloring the sound (and looks like an aluminum die from Dungeons and Dragons). The 19 also features design elements inspired by jet engines, and the 17 has a frosted ""broken ice grid"" covering the actual speakers. The 17 has a 6-inch midrange woofer paired with a 3/4-inch tweeter and powered by a pair of 160-watt amps. The 19 pushes air through two 8-inch woofers, each with its own 160-watt amp. The BeoLab 18 is the clear flagship of the lineup, and it incorporates optional wood materials with its aluminum elements. It is designed to recall the original 8000, while bringing it up to a more modern appearance. The 18 features B&O's Acoustic Lens technology, commonly used in vehicles, as well as two 4-inch midrange woofers powered by separate 160-watt amplifiers.  For now, the wireless capabilities are limited to B&O's own products The new speakers are the first on the market that use the WiSA wireless standard, and can work with any device that supports the standard. B&O's latest television sets all come with WiSA support built-in, and the company expects many more devices to launch in the near future with support. Unfortunately, until that happens, the wireless capabilities of the new speakers are limited to B&O's own products, and it doesn't look like you'll be able to send music or audio to them from your smartphone or tablet any time soon.  The system can support both music and audio from movies and TV in up to 7.1 channel surround. Bang & Olufsen gave us a demo of the speakers playing back audio from Spotify and a Blu-ray movie, and unsurprisingly, the sound was crisp, loud, and free of distortion. B&O calls its wireless technology ""Immaculate Wireless Sound"", and based on the demos given to us, that's an apt descriptor. Bang & Olufsen's products have always been targeted for the high-end market, and the BeoLab 17, 18, and 19 are no different. The 17 will be sold in pairs for $3,990, while the 19 will list for $3,390. The BeoLab 18 will retail for $6,590 with black fronts, while the oak wood fronts will cost another $1,390.

(Image credit: Michael Henley / Flickr) Winter is fast descending upon China, and with it, thick clouds of smog. Last week, officials shut down schools and major roads in the northeast city of Harbin after air pollution there reached dangerously high levels. For days, the city and its 11 million inhabitants were at a standstill; streets were desolate, businesses were closed, and visibility dwindled to just 65 feet. At the height of the crisis, pollution levels were more than 30 times the limit considered safe by the World Health Organization (WHO). The smog has since subsided in Harbin, but the outbreak has revived longstanding debates across China, where rapid economic growth and a lingering dependence on coal have combined to deteriorate air quality at alarming rates. And although the government has made moves to address the issue with new regulations and emergency plans, some have begun taking matters into their own hands. ""It’s a very dramatic way of saying, ""here’s the sun."" Last week, Dutch designer Daan Roosegaarde unveiled a new ""electronic vacuum"" capable of purifying air by magnetically pulling smog particles to the ground. The idea, he says, is to eventually deploy the device at public parks across Beijing, carving oases of clean air and sunshine out of the country’s smog-plagued metropolises. ""It's a very dramatic way of saying, 'here’s the sun,'"" Roosegaarde says. ""Here's the new world, why should we accept the old world?""  Roosegaarde created the vacuum in collaboration with Environmental Nano Solutions (ENS) Europe, an air-cleaning technology company, and Bob Ursem, a scientist at Delft University who developed the electromagnetic system underpinning it. The ""vacuum"" consists of a series of electrodes connected to a high-voltage power supply and placed a few centimeters above the ground. This creates a weak electrostatic field that imbues all nearby air and smog particles with a positive charge. A grounded device then pulls these particles to the ground, where they can be collected and disposed as normal waste. The project is still in an early phase of development — Roosegaarde says he came up with the idea while looking at smog clouds outside his Beijing hotel room window — but the designer has already developed a working prototype, and last month struck a deal to begin testing it in a Beijing public park within a year. In indoor tests, the system created a cubic meter of purified space inside a smog-filled, 25-square-meter room, and ENS says the device can purify 28,000 cubic meters using less energy than a typical incandescent light bulb. It can also purify air amid wind speeds of up to 13 meters per second, but scaling it up — and preventing purified air from being instantly polluted by incoming smog — may prove challenging.  A diagram of the chemistry behind Roosegaarde's smog system. (Image credit: ENS Europe) ""I am actually very skeptical of this project,"" says Chi Jen-Yang, a research scientist at Duke University who has written extensively on pollution and energy policy in China. He notes that electromagnetic dust removal has proven effective in indoor settings, though applying the same techniques outdoors would require a much stronger electromagnetic force, which could damage electronic devices and credit cards. Without a strong electromagnetic field, Chi says, the system would likely have ""little benefit."" Roosegaarde readily admits that the vacuum isn't a solution to China’s smog problem, and acknowledges the challenges involved with introducing it outdoors. He has a history of pursuing bold projects, as well, including ""Smart Highway"": an initiative to illuminate road markings with custom-developed photoluminescent paint, rather than streetlights. To him, the smog project is as much about creating green spaces as it is about recasting environmental debates within a more social context. ""This is not the real answer to smog."" ""This is not the real answer to smog,"" Roosegaarde tells The Verge. ""The real answer is changing our lifestyle. But what it does is move away from a scientific, fact sheet discussion [about smog] and toward a human, more sociological discussion. It will create new interactions between people and space, between people and each other."" Yet ENS is intent on commercializing the technology and expanding it beyond public parks, noting that the same principles could be used on factory exhaust stacks, road equipment, and indoor spaces. ""We don't feel it's just an awareness project,"" says Lia van de Vorle, ENS Europe CEO. ""We want to make it happen worldwide."" And they're certainly not the only ones working on high-tech solutions. Earlier this year, researchers from the Eindhoven University of Technology successfully tested smog-absorbing concrete slabs, demonstrating their ability to remove nitrogen oxides and other pollutants from the air. Similar technologies have already been deployed on sidewalks and buildings in London, Mexico City, and Chicago.  A view of Harbin, China, which was brought to a standstill last week due to dangerous smog levels. (Image credit: Fredrik Rubensson / Flickr) Yet for all the promise that recent innovations may hold, experts say China's smog issues demand more drastic government action, pointing to the increasingly severe crises that the country has seen in recent years. In January, pollution levels in Beijing quite literally broke the scale, exceeding the index that the US embassy uses to monitor air quality. And recent research suggests that people in some regions are already starting to feel its effects. A study published in July found that over the past two decades, coal pollution in northern China has cut life expectancy there by at least five years. On average, people living in the country’s southern regions live about 3.5 years longer than their northern counterparts, the paper reported. According to a study published in April, China's air pollution led to an estimated 1.2 million premature deaths in 2010 alone. Pollution from electricity-producing coal plants are seen as the primary driver behind China's smog, which is why the country's colder northern regions see worse outbreaks during the winter, when people begin heating their homes. Although the government has made renewable energy a long-term priority, coal still provides an estimated 70 percent of China’s electricity. According to recent data from the US Energy Information Administration, China continues to burn nearly as much coal as the rest of the world combined. ""they realize that they have to take real action."" For years, critics have accused Beijing of ignoring the severity of its smog problems, though this year’s crises seem to have finally pushed the government to take stronger action. In September, the country released its most ambitious smog plan to date, aiming to reduce coal consumption in Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei, and Shandong by 83 million metric tons annually over the next four years. Following this month's outbreak in Harbin, the government announced plans to begin monitoring the health impacts of smog within the next five years. ""From a long-term perspective, we think these plans are actually quite comprehensive,"" says Huang Wei, a climate and energy campaigner at Greenpeace's Beijing office. She says the moves attack the ""fundamental problems"" behind smog, though she notes that China has struggled to implement environmental regulations in the past, and that the plans announced this year must be carried out with strong oversight and enforcement. Transitioning away from coal will certainly take time, Huang adds, and it's unlikely that a single innovation will solve China’s smog crisis overnight. But the fact that the government is even acknowledging the problem is itself a sign of progress. ""The government and the public didn't know how severe the issue is, and how many cities are suffering,"" Huang says. ""Now they realize that they have to take real action.""",0.504844047568966,0.49515595243103405,0.8745686456563853,1283,5.3156664068589246,693,6.4834054834054831,0,0,"Design, Policy & Law, Science, US & World, Report",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

He'd recently had a daughter, and he knew his next venture would involve helping kids. Then he chanced across an article about Estonia, and how that country begins teaching programming to all children in first grade. He did a little research into the state of computer science education in America and was shocked to find how rare it was. So he set out to create a compelling way for children as young as four or five to start learning basic coding concepts. The result was Play-i, a new startup building robots that it hopes will teach children about programming through play. The company is launching a crowdfunding campaign today to raise $250,000 for its first two models. ""Thinking back on my own life, I began learning computer science at 14. I couldn’t imagine absorbing those programming concepts, at least the way I was taught them, at an early age,"" says Gupta, who serves as Play-i's CEO. ""But research from MIT and Tufts showed pre-schoolers can grasp programming concepts, most just don’t have the right tools or framework provided to them.""   The team at Play-i decided to avoid abstract concepts and the traditional focus on written code and syntax that are the core elements of most common programming languages today. ""A lot of coding is about putting things in a sequence,"" says Gupta. ""Ask a four- or five-year-old kid to write out a sequence, and they have trouble organizing a long string of commands. But if you reframe that as a song with lyrics, or a story with a narrative, children that age can create and remember long, complex sequences."" Kids interact with Play-i's robots, Yana and Bo, by giving them instructions. This can be through a tablet or smartphone, where they can drag and drop a sequence of commands. ""As they do this, we can begin to introduce some other basic elements of coding, like the concept of loops, or an 'if this than that' instruction,"" says Gupta. Bo, which can play music on a xylophone, also responds to physical commands. ""You can move him, and he will remember that motion, store it as a command, and allow you to play it back or insert it into a sequence.""   Gupta assembled a team of hardware experts to help him build Play-i's robots. Co-founder Saurabh Gupta, no relation, is a former engineering manager at Apple who helped design and build 10 generations of iPods. And co-founder Mikal Greaves is a former of employee of Frog Design, where he led the engineering team on projects for Motorola, Disney, and Ford. ""We're all programmers and engineers passionate about technology, but above all, we're parents,"" says Gupta. ""We knew the biggest engineering challenge was keeping the robots affordable."" For the crowdfunding campaign launching today, backers will be able to receive Yana for $49, Bo for $149, and the pair for $189. The final retail price after the campaign will likely be higher. Yana is cheaper than Bo because she cannot be remotely controlled to move.  A path to a lifetime of programming It remains to be see whether or not kids who play with these robots will actually show better programming skills than their peers. Yana and Bo are based on academic research, but they haven't been proven in the field. ""We are crafting a new language that we hope will open up this world to children,"" says Gupta. The key, Gupta believes, is making sure children can follow their curiosity as far as it leads them. ""When they assign the command, so that when they shake the robot, it roars like a lion, that is actually a subroutine which I have given the name, image and sound of 'lion.'"" Kids who wonder how that command works can actually look into the code behind it and learn how to create their own versions. Play-i says its robots will work with drag-and-drop programming languages like Scratch and Blockly, basic ones like C, and even more difficult languages like Python. ""We hope Yana and Bo set them down the path to a lifetime of programming,"" says Gupta. ""And we plan provide them any tools they might need along the way.""

It’s the latest effort to expand the atomic unit of a tweet beyond 140 characters. The implementation is straightforward: a big ""Buy"" button that will appear alongside an image of the item for sale. Give Twitter your billing and shipping info once and you can make one-click purchases from inside a tweet if you’re logged into the app or web service. The big question on Wall Street’s mind is whether this might provide the company a meaningful secondary stream of revenue alongside advertising. The more interesting question for the average consumer is if the real-time nature of Twitter might produce some interesting new forms of business we haven’t seen yet. ""There are already transactional conversations happening every day on our platform between brands and their customers or artists and their fans,"" says Nathan Hubbard, Twitter’s head of commerce. ""What we’re trying to do is build the shortest path between an offer and a completed sale, to eliminate the friction of clicking a link that takes you to another website where you might have to type in a whole bunch of information each time.""  For now commerce will only be turned on in the US and with a limited set of partners. Four startups: Stripe, Gumroad, The Fancy, and MusicToday, will be working with Twitter at the platform level. A handful of celebrities, merchants and charities are also going to be testing commerce at launch, including Pharrell, Home Depot, Donors Choose, and Brad Paisley. Sources familiar with the company's plans say it hopes the items on offer will range from sneakers to smartphones to new albums or a chance to support a good cause. It’s not what’s on sale for Twitter that will be most interesting, but the way the offers work. ""An opportunity to create a new kind of sales.""  ""Anything with a perishable component, temporal nature, or limited supply, is going to thrive on Twitter,"" says Hubbard. ""Given the speed at which word can spread across our network, it feels like an opportunity to create a new kind of sales."" It’s easy to image actors and musicians tweeting out tickets for secret screenings or concerts. Food trucks, already popular on Twitter, might peddle items that will be sold out or stale in a few hours. A more meaningful applications of Twitter's commerce could be connected to breaking news, for example tweets about a natural disaster connected directly to a donate button. Can a merchant like Home Depot actually work on Twitter? ""People are not going to be buying lawn mowers, because that’s not the mindset on Twitter,"" says Rick Heiztmann, a tech investor who has backed social networks like Pinterest. ""What you will probably see succeed is digital goods. Tease a snippet of a larger article, book, game, or movie in a tweet, with a buy button that entices you to pay for the whole thing."" Heitzmann says gaming companies his firm have invested in have already seen Twitter advertising pay off, with promoted Tweets an especially effective tool to drive app installs. Heitzmann predicts the best results will come from offerings that leverage spontaneity and small dollar amounts. ""Imagine a fantasy football draft night, and your favorite sports blog or athlete tweets out a message, inviting you to pay a dollar to find out who the sleepers are."" Calls to action on Twitter looking to keep things simple have in the past asked users to text a certain number in order to make a donation. ""That seems easy at first, but probably has a fifty percent drop off rate. If it’s as simple as seeing a tweet and clicking a button, I bet organizations like the Red Cross would see much better return on investment."" Facebook has had several big flops with commerce Facebook has also had success of late driving customers to small, digital transactions. But it’s experience with more conventional goods was less encouraging. Back in September of 2012 the company launched Facebook Gifts, trying to entice users bombarded with constant birthday reminders to buy a teddy bear or pair of socks. It never took off, and was shut down this year. Facebook also experimented with ""storefronts"", giving merchants the option to open virtual shops on its platform. But just a few months after their debut, most were shuttered. ""For us, it’s been a way we communicate with customers on deals, not a place to sell,"" Gamestops vice president of marketing and strategy told Bloomberg.   Twitter has struggled to connect with mainstream users in the way Facebook has, an obstacle that has limited its total size to about one fourth of its rival social network. But it has been successful with advertising, doubling its revenue over the last year, and commerce may simply be an extension of that.""As a business, Twitter is an advertising platform that allows brands to target prospective or existing customers with lots of interest and behavioral data,"" says tech investor David Pakman. ""Most online advertisers are carefully focused on the performance of online ads and completing the loop from ad to conversion is important."" If Twitter can hit a home run with commerce, the company may have a trump card it can play with investors, publishers, and advertisers. In the future it could monetize the Buy botton through promoted Tweets, or by taking an affiliate fee on each sale, but for the time being Twitter is adamant that this is an experimental product from which it won’t be making any money, looking instead to perfect the user experience and see what happens. ""Usually we put out products and our uses come up with the most interesting applications,"" says Hubbard. Twitter users brought the @ standard to the platform, and the first use of the hashtag and retweet. ""Commerce might look very different in the US versus Indonesia versus Brazil. We are excited to put it into people’s hands and let them tell us what works.""",0.6448968128414954,0.35510318715850464,0.19862430526453037,1011,4.9505440158259146,547,6.1901279707495434,1,0,"Business, Tech, Report",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

""It's a new, intimate way to communicate from your wrist, and a comprehensive health and fitness device."" The Apple Watch is being pushed as an accessory to help the average person lead a more active life and for professional athletes to take their training to the next level. There are already a lot of wearable fitness trackers on the market, but none have managed to become mainstream best sellers. If it works as promised, the Apple Watch is poised to change all that. ""Now the consumer won't have to choose."" ""The Apple Watch is powerful. This does what a Fitbit or Jawbone or Nike Fuelband does, but it offers music and the apps integrated into the device,"" says Julie Ask, a digital health analyst with Forrester Research. ""Now the consumer won't have to choose"" between a dedicated fitness device and the fun and utility of a smartphone on your wrist.    The Apple Watch will track your heart rate and measure three separate categories of movement. The first is the ""Move"" ring, which measures the calories you've burned and tells you when you've hit your personal goal for the day. The ""Exercise"" ring captures more brisk movement, and closes when you've put in 30 minutes total each day. The ""Stand"" ring measures how often you break from the sedentary reality of parking your butt in an office chair all day, and closes when you've gotten up for at least one minute in twelve different hours during the day. It pairs with the barometer in the newest iPhones to track your climbs and claims it will be able to distinguish the intensity of your activity to better track the calories you're burning. At $349 dollars the Apple Watch is more expensive than your average fitness tracker, roughly three times the cost of our current favorite, the Jawbone Up24. A much bigger drawback is that it needs to be paired with your iPhone for one of its best features — GPS to track your distance — to function. But startups in the health and fitness space were excited about what they saw. ""Wearables need to pass the turnaround test."" ""Wearables need to pass the turnaround test. If you left home without it,  would you go back and get it?"" asks Mike Lee, CEO of MyFitnessPal. ""The Apple Watch has the potential to be that device.""  Lee says that even if the Apple Watch doesn't have features like GPS when it's not paired with your iPhone, he thinks it will be a strong offering in the wearable fitness market. ""The barometer adds a lot of interesting new data, and the combination of heart rate and accelerometer allows for a much better measurement of how many calories you're burning."" Most importantly, says Lee, a watch is often something that becomes an everyday, all day part of your attire. ""The true north for us is user success, and the way to achieve that is through building habits. An Apple Watch looks habit forming."" ""Battery could be the Achilles heel."" The man leading the charge on the watch is Jay Blahnik, Apple's director of Fitness and Health technologies. While Apple has some big ambitions around what they could do with users' medical records, for now, it's focusing far more on the quotidian things a smartwatch could do to help the average person live a slightly fitter life. ""[It's] designed to help anyone who wears it live a healthier life by being more active,"" Blahnik said in a promotional video Apple showed onstage. These are the kind of generic fitness goals that will appeal to a mass audience, and Apple has promised that it will include a social component, leader board, and digital rewards, to help get users motivated. ""Battery could be the achilles heel,"" says Ask. You have to charge the unit each day, unlike fitness trackers or sport watches that can last a week. But she still feels it's likely to be a game changer for the wearable fitness market.

The irony is thick enough to spread with a spatula, but that’s just the frosting on top of the multi-layered shit cake that has comprised the mobile payments industry so far. Paying with your phone has always been a confusing mess. It has always been a financial cold war between credit card companies, banks, phone companies, and phone manufacturers fighting to divert a tiny rivulet of the humongous river of money that flows through credit cards every day. Incompatible and confusing systems proliferate and vary depending on country, region, carrier, and who makes your phone. The result: incompatible and confusing systems that are hard to understand and even harder to successfully use. Which is why, for me, the most revolutionary thing Apple announced yesterday wasn’t a giant iPhone or the Apple Watch, it was Apple Pay. On stage yesterday, Apple CEO Tim Cook pulled no punches when talking about what’s wrong with the mobile payments industry. ""Most people that have worked on [mobile payments],"" Cook explained, ""have started by focusing on creating a business model that was centered around their self-interest instead of focusing on the user experience."" Not only was Cook exactly right about that, if anything he understated the case. I’ve sat through conferences where carrier executives bragged about their ability to literally sell space on the secure element inside their customers’ SIM cards. And when carriers and banks weren’t wheeling and dealing, they have been engaged in an Illuminati-esque battle for slivers of the transaction fees we all pay — and also the valuable consumer metadata each transaction creates. It’s been cutthroat, opaque, and confusing. It’s no wonder, then, that the last high-minded attempt from a big company to fix this mess failed. Google Wallet, though it has been rebranded and repurposed as an all-around solution for buying things through Google, was unable to overcome the incredibly strong entrenched interests in the payments space. Carriers, in the thick of developing Softcard, openly blocked Wallet on their branded devices without consequence — a peril of an open platform like Android. Google Wallet’s dynamic, straightforward, and intelligent VP Osama Bedier left for greener pastures just over a year ago — and Google’s ambitions for Wallet look much smaller today than when it originally launched. Apple’s foray into that same muck was much more successful. According to reports from Bloomberg and The Wall Street Journal, Apple will be taking a cut from each transaction. But Apple will not, according to Eddy Cue, be collecting any information about your transactions. Your credit card data and the information your purchases generate are all run through anonymized tokens that are said to be considerably more secure than a simple swipe. The system behind those tokens was first agreed upon about a year ago, according to Rajat Taneja, executive vice president, technology, at Visa. ""We are at this very important moment in the industry,"" Taneja says, ""there is a common standard."" His company dedicated 750 people and a year of time to perfect it, and other companies like MasterCard dedicated similar efforts to their own implementations. But the more important thing is that there is a common implementation of this token system. It’s been a rare piece of collaboration and agreement between all the various players in the banking space, and it’s not much of a coincidence that it’s being implemented on Apple’s devices. James Anderson, group head and SVP, mobile and emerging payments at MasterCard, says that his company began working with Apple in 2013. Like Taneja, he’s excited about the possibility of finally seeing a ubiquitous, commonly-used standard for mobile payments. In particular, he pointed out that his company was able to develop a new system for digitizing credit cards that’s easier than what’s come before. Just ""getting the consumer ready to pay"" in the first place was a huge pain point before, but now the banks are able to securely get you set up with a photograph of your credit card and some back-end verifications of your identity. More than anything else in yesterday’s keynote, Apple Pay was a classic Apple moment of simplification and integration. It’s analogous to what the iPhone did to the smartphone space. Before the iPhone, smartphones were confusing, fragmented, and just plain not very good. But Apple forced carriers to leave its phone alone. It also took a bunch of pre-existing technologies and integrated them in such a way that the final product was much more than the sum of its parts. Apple could be having the same moment now with mobile payments. Instead of bowing to the varied business interests and releasing a substandard solution, Apple appears to have (finally!) thrown its significant weight around to bring credit card companies, carriers, and banks to heel. Because of its unified ecosystem and dominant reach, it has a real chance to become the de facto mobile payments standard. ""The ubiquity of Apple devices and the fact that a lot of point-of-sale devices are being refreshed"" are both reasons that Apple Pay could be a success, according to Taneja. And though Apple isn’t gathering data, Visa still is; the company tells me that ""We treat [a tokenized Apple Pay] transaction just like any other Visa transaction,"" Taneja says. That’s perhaps something to worry about — the idea of letting Apple have this much power in a vital part of our economy could be seen as dangerous. But it’s also the only solution that makes sense right now. Google and Softcard (nee ISIS) haven’t gained any real consumer traction and don’t seem likely to anytime soon. There are still important questions. Will it be as secure as Apple promises? Will enough stores actually sign on and support the payments system? (Early wins — Subway, McDonald’s, and Starbucks, among others — are promising.) Will the banks and credit card companies screw up their end — or worse, withdraw support? Even more problematic is that NFC itself is not a magic bullet. It needs to be in more point-of-sale systems, and it needs to be there fast. Indeed, not everyone thinks that this is the cure-all: Apple Pay ""will not be transformational,"" says Will Graylin, an experienced entrepreneur in the payments space and co-founder of Loop. ""Merchant NFC and QR code acceptance is so small that the accessibility that consumers demand is simply not being met."" Having watched mobile payments for years now, I can say with confidence that there are no easy answers anywhere. Anderson, who has been in the mobile payments business for over seven years, says that ""it sounds so simple, but it’s been really hard for people to pull off at scale."" Hopefully it works this time. Hopefully the various powers that control tiny parts of the rest of the ecosystem will find a way to do something equally simple on Android and Windows Phone. But even if Apple Pay fails, at the very least we got the moment yesterday when Apple’s CEO stood on stage and told the truth: mobile payments have sucked so far, and it’s high time somebody fixed it.",0.5104097119161746,0.48959028808382543,0.1565987237398981,1241,5.1031426269137796,640,6.3265624999999996,1,8,"Apple, Business, Tech, Report",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

The company is yet to outline the details of the attack, but used vague language to suggest that customers who used credit or debit cards at its retail stores in the US and Canada over the last five months may have had their card details compromised. The breach appears to have been carried out using a similar method to recent attacks on companies such as Target, P.F. Chang's, and Neiman Marcus. The perpetrators of such attacks uploaded malicious software to cash registers and other point-of-sale systems in order to siphon off card details, which could be sent off-site and could be used to make fraudulent purchases. The scale of the breach is unclear The Home Depot says its investigation into the breach began on September 2nd, the same day that reports surfaced that said the retailer was the next in a string of large companies to be targeted by hackers. The hardware giant is focusing its investigation from April onwards, suggesting that the hackers behind the breach were able to skim customer data from the stores' payment systems for up to five months without being detected. The company is yet to say specifically that credit card details were stolen, but the measures it has offered to affected customers suggests that's the case. Those who shopped at Home Depot stores in North America have been offered credit monitoring and ID protection services for free by the company, and Frank Blake, The Home Depot chairman and CEO, said customers would not be responsible for any fraudulent charges to their accounts.

In some ways, it's surprising it took this long In some ways, it's surprising it took this long to create a women-only taxi service. Sexual assault by cab drivers is a real and serious issue, so it's understandable if women prefer a female driver. Because of widespread gender discrimination in the livery business, it's hard to find one through traditional channels. As the Times piece points out, just five percent of black car drivers in the city are women. Yellow cab numbers are even worse, with female drivers accounting for just over one percent of the city's cabs. As a result, finding female drivers has become a real niche, and one that SheTaxis seems to have all to itself. In other words, banning men can be a completely legitimate business decision.

Instead of splitting the existing market into segments, Colorado's new law actually expanded the overall market for legal marijuana. Colorado sold more than $700 million worth of cannabis in 2014 In a lengthy report, the Colorado Department of Revenue details how the introduction of recreational marijuana has strengthened the overall market. In an earlier 12-month period between July 2012 and July 2013, before recreational marijuana was legalized, sales of medical weed only brought in $329 million. In 2014, the sales of legal cannabis marijuana in Colorado were worth more than $700 million — and only 36 percent of that figure was attributed to recreational pot. The data shows that the amount of medical marijuana cultivated has stayed relatively level, rather than dropping, under the new laws. At the same time, recreational use has soared: more than 20 tons of cannabis were sold on the commercial market last year.   It's not clear whether the recreational market has strengthened the medical sector because there's more cannabis being grown, if the industry is better developed and able to get its products to medical dispensaries, or people are simply happier to get medical weed if their friends can huff on a doobie whenever they like, but the facts have implications for other states.

As GigaOm first reported, Netflix announced a special deal with Australian ISP iiNet to exempt its traffic from broadband data caps. Remember: Netflix lobbied hard for net neutrality — so hard it even helped change the FCC's definition of it. And zero-rating schemes like Netflix's new deal with iiNet (or like T-Mobile's controversial music freedom program, or AT&T's ""sponsored data"" program) clearly violate the principles of net neutrality. So was Netflix lying to its customers and the public about its stance the whole time? Netflix did not respond to our request for comment by the time this story was published, but just consider what Netflix CEO Reed Hastings said on Facebook last April:  Comcast no longer following net neutrality principles. Comcast should apply caps equally, or not at all. I spent the weekend enjoying four good internet video apps on my Xbox: Netflix, HBO GO, Xfinity, and Hulu. When I watch video on my Xbox from three of these four apps, it counts against my Comcast internet cap.When I watch through Comcast’s Xfinity app, however, it does not count against my Comcast internet cap. For example, if I watch last night’s SNL episode on my Xbox through the Hulu app, it eats up about one gigabyte of my cap, but if I watch that same episode through the Xfinity Xbox app, it doesn’t use up my cap at all. The same device, the same IP address, the same wifi, the same internet connection, but totally different cap treatment. In what way is this neutral? Netflix is now voluntarily participating in the exact thing it has ostensibly been fighting for more than a year. And bragging about it! Here's what Netflix's Director of Business Development, Paul Perryman, said about the deal in iiNet's press release: Working with iiNet to offer quota-free Netflix content gives more people in the country the opportunity to familiarize themselves with who we are and what our service offers. We're confident that Australian audiences will love Netflix and we're looking forward to shaking things up in the local subscription TV market. It's a flip-flop even Frank Underwood couldn't make with a straight face, especially coming on the heels of last week's major net neutrality victory in the US. Where do you really stand, Netflix? Update, 3:09PM: Netflix responded to our story with the following comment: Zero rating isn't great for consumers as it has the potential to distort consumer choice in favor of choices selected by an ISP. We'll push back against such efforts, but we won't put our service or our members at a disadvantage.",0.46075049756433933,0.5392495024356607,0.2232788990837087,461,4.9826464208242953,284,5.76056338028169,0,0,"Policy & Law, Tech, US & World",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

Clinton, who served as Secretary of State from 2009 to 2013, reportedly did not have a government email account during her term and conducted official business exclusively through a private email account. Personal accounts should only be used in emergencies ""It is very difficult to conceive of a scenario — short of nuclear winter — where an agency would be justified in allowing its cabinet-level head officer to solely use a private email communications channel for the conduct of government business,"" Jason R. Baron, a lawyer and former director of litigation at the National Archives and Records Administration, told The New York Times. Federal law states that letters and emails written and received by federal officials are government records and, unless they contain classified or sensitive materials, should be kept where third parties can access them. Personal email accounts are supposed to be reserved for use in emergencies. Nick Merrill, a spokesperson for Hillary Clinton, said that she had followed the ""letter and spirit of the rules,"" and said that she had ""every expectation"" that emails sent to other officials in the State Department would be kept, but did not specify whether she used any form of encryption to secure her correspondence. Merrill also did not reference emails sent to officials outside of the government and did not explain the wider issue of why Clinton decided to use a personal email account to communicate in her official business. The account itself was reportedly discovered by a committee investigating the attack on the American Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, after the State Department reviewed Clinton's messages and provided the group with 300 emails regarding the assault. The National Archives has few ways to enforce penalties Clinton's advisers have since combed further through the account, giving 55,000 pages of her personal emails as part of a State Department drive to comply with federal record-keeping practices, but it's not clear how many more were not handed over. Thomas S. Blanton, director of transparency advocacy group the National Security Archive, said that someone in the State Department ""deserves credit"" for asking for Clinton's records. ""Most of the time it takes the threat of litigation and embarrassment,"" he said. Blanton argues that personal emails are insecure, and that senior officials should not be using them to communicate. ""It's a shame [record-keeping] didn't take place automatically when she was Secretary of State as it should have,"" he said, but The New York Times notes that penalties for not keeping proper federal records are ""rare,"" because the National Archives and Record Administration has few ways to enforce its rules. Still, Clinton's actions seem egregious compared to those of her successor as Secretary of State — John Kerry has used an official government email account since taking the job in 2013 — and could draw accusations of secrecy and a lack of transparency in the run-up to the next presidential election. In contrast to Clinton, possible Republican presidential race rival Jeb Bush recently released an archive of emails sent and received during his eight-year stint as governor of Florida.",0.44515668445225226,0.5548433155477477,0.8677072567496094,551,5.3339382940108893,292,6.3424657534246576,0,0,"Policy & Law, US & World",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

A federal court in Jackson, Mississippi, has granted a preliminary injunction against Hood's efforts to fight content piracy on Google's network, restricting any subpoena or further investigative action from Hood while the case is still in progress. It's still early in the case, but the injunction represents a significant win for Google and a real setback for both Hood and his supporters at the MPAA. ""We're pleased with the court's ruling."" In 2013, Hood sent Google a massive, 79-page subpoena for data related to content piracy in Search, but Google contested the subpoena, claiming it overstepped the attorney general's authority and violated a number of US privacy laws. Hood had called a ""time out"" to the legal actions in the aftermath of the Goliath disclosures, but the court case has continued in the months since. Ultimately, Hood was seeking a similar legal authority over Google's network as SOPA looked to establish, although Hood was pursuing it through judicial rather than legislative channels. The exact text of the injunction is still under seal, but it represents a significant win for Google, barring any aspect of Hood's subpoena from going forward while the case is still in progress. It's also a sign that Google has made a strong case overall. The judge was willing to grant the injunction because, as he put it, ""Google has the better side of the legal arguments."" The final ruling won't come in until later this year, but this injunction gives Google a clear upper hand as the case proceeds. After months of legal limbo, Google was quick to celebrate the injunction as an early win.

Originally founded in 1970 as a place for comic book enthusiasts to gather and talk, it’s ballooned and transformed over the ensuing decades, and is now better known as a massive Hollywood bulkhead designed to push the biggest of big franchise movies into mainstream consciousness.  It’s where Marvel announced the title of Avengers: Age of Ultron. It’s where director Zack Snyder shocked everyone with the news of Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice. But as the lines have grown longer and the marketplace saturated with comic book movies, there’s been a growing countermovement, one in which companies like Disney have begun to favor their own conventions so they can show off their wares without fear of being upstaged, and other studios are deciding to just forego the festivities altogether. While two years ago San Diego Comic-Con may have felt like the most important date on Hollywood’s calendar next to the Oscars, it now finds itself on the precipice of potentially becoming a lot like CES: a mecca and must-attend event for the faithful, sure, but not the epicenter for news it once was.  It’s a shift that’s happened quickly and mercilessly. With Star Wars: The Force Awakens in attendance and Warner Bros. taking advantage of Marvel’s absence to tout its upcoming DC slate — hopefully turning around some lackluster buzz in the process — there’s plenty at stake this year, both for the movie studios and Comic-Con’s ability to steer public opinion. We’ve broken down some of the biggest items to keep an eye on, and we’ll be there on the ground to see how everyone does. Above all else, this is the year of Star Wars, and Lucasfilm is hosting a panel in the cavernous Hall H to highlight The Force Awakens. Already confirmed are director J.J. Abrams, writer Lawrence Kasdan, and producer Kathleen Kennedy, but we’re expecting quite a bit more. While new footage isn’t expected, it wouldn’t be Comic-Con without some of the cast showing up to talk about their work on the film. Most of the team showed up during Star Wars Celebration, but Harrison Ford, Adam Driver, and Gwendoline Christie have yet to make public appearances promoting the movie. What better time to send the universe of fans spinning out of control than the home base of fan culture itself? The big question: Just hang on. There’s no stopping this train. Marvel won’t be attending Comic-Con this year — we’re expecting a big presence at Disney’s biennial D23 conference in August — but the company’s absence presents a huge opportunity for Warner Bros. and its own superhero slate. The cast of Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice will be in attendance, including Ben Affleck as Batman and Jesse Eisenberg as Lex Luthor. And we wouldn’t be surprised to see new footage from both that film and David Ayer’s Suicide Squad. The keystone to the entire Warner / DC strategy, of course, is matching Marvel’s The Avengers with its own Justice League series. While interest is certainly high, questions remain about whether jumpstarting an entire expanded universe with a single film is going to work (there’s also those concerns about Jared Leto’s Joker). A good way to blow past that concern would be to put the entire Justice League on stage together for the first time, drowning out naysayers with the sheer power of fanboy hype. The big question: Can Warner Bros. prove Zack Snyder has things on the right track? If fans walk out of Hall H without being 100 percent convinced, it could make for a rocky road from here to B v. S’s 2016 release date. Let’s get real: there’s reason to be concerned about the new Fantastic Four. Rumors of a troubled production at the hands of director Josh Trank persisted during filming, with reshoots appearing to buttress the claims. Of course, reshoots are pretty standard these days, but then there was that whole ""Trank getting fired from a Star Wars movie"" thing. With Fantastic Four opening in August, this is Fox’s chance to turn around any restlessness and put the movie on course for a strong, successful opening. However, the majority of Fox’s panel may end up being about other franchises entirely. Director Bryan Singer recently teased that X-Men: Apocalypse will be a big part of the studio’s Hall H presentation, and Deadpool recently finished filming. An appearance from Ryan Reynolds would be a perfect fit, particularly when you consider that there’s more Comic-Con cosplay per capita for Deadpool than any other character. [Note: totally unverifiable stat that the author nonetheless stands by without equivocation.] The big question: Can Fox salvage bad Fantastic Four buzz and tee up Deadpool? Warcraft fandom is insane. Comic-Con fans are insane. This should be great, right? The question becomes how do you turn a game like Warcraft into something that’s going to appeal to those who aren’t already fans of Blizzard’s universe? Legendary Pictures will be using Comic-Con to test how they’ve done, and while a brief teaser was shown at BlizzCon last year we expect this will be the first time a wider audience gets a look at footage from the film, with director Duncan Jones (Moon) in attendance. The panel should also provide a bit of insight into how Legendary’s upcoming slate is looking overall. While the company started incredibly strong in its early days with movies like The Hangover and Christopher Nolan’s Dark Knight trilogy, recent films like Seventh Son have proved problematic. With Krampus and Guillermo del Toro’s upcoming Crimson Peak also expected to get some time at Comic-Con, it will have plenty to show. The big question: Can Legendary prove its new movies are more Godzilla and less Blackhat? Like SXSW before it, Comic-Con has increasingly amped up the television presence over the past decade. While many TV panels were once relegated to convention center rooms or the second-tier Ballroom 20, this year TV continues to be dominant in Hall H. Among the shows taking over Comic-Con’s premiere room are Game of Thrones, The Walking Dead (and its upcoming prequel), Heroes Reborn, Ryan Murphy’s Scream Queens and the full roster of DC’s shows, including Supergirl. There’s also the San Diego Gaslamp District, which is usually transformed into a kaleidoscopic horrorshow of TV-oriented brand installations and promotional opportunities. The big question: How will fans react — on the ground and online? Nothing breaks the internet like fervor over a television show, and that response will tell the tale of whether TV will be able to take over the spotlight completely should movie studios continue to drift away from Comic-Con. While superheroes may be the primary lens through which most people see Comic-Con, the young adult genre has been a huge part of the show going back to the Harry Potter and Twilight films. That presence is even more pronounced this year, with Hunger Games dominating Thursday as the only big movie in Hall H, and The Vampire Diaries getting a promotion to the big room for a doubleheader with Supernatural. It’s part of the changing face of the convention, with a younger, very vocal generation poised to redefine fandom over the next decade. The big question: The only real question is whether YA fans merely match the attendance and passion of superhero fans — or outclass them completely. One of the biggest things to watch this week will be the studios that won’t actually be in San Diego. Except for a Pixar short film panel, Disney is taking a break from movies this year, and Sony, Paramount, and Marvel are all sitting it out as well. (Universal is also playing it very low-key, letting Legendary take the lead for its movies and sticking to a smaller panel for the upcoming M. Night Shyamalan movie The Visit). The common denominator here is that none of these players have superhero movies on the immediate horizon, but Paramount’s Star Trek Beyond seems like a gimme for Comic-Con — and it’s coming out next year. But if, as I suspect, Comic-Con isn’t helping movies break through like it used to, the studio’s absence could be the loudest bellwether of the convention’s transformation. The big question: Will strategically timed trailer releases or other announcements allow the studios to remain part of the conversation despite not heading down to San Diego?",0.6367780425832548,0.36322195741674523,0.17436302554932723,1403,5.0399144689950104,718,6.272980501392758,0,28,"Comic-Con, Culture, Entertainment, Film, TV",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

For some people, it’s rooftop cookouts and cut-rate fireworks; for others, it’s just another block of time they can spend blasting through their Netflix queue. Lil Wayne tried to embody the spirit of the holiday this year with the release of The Free Weezy Album (FWA), a new full-length that slipped onto Tidal Saturday and into dustier corners of the internet shortly after. The music contained within is unspectacular, which shouldn’t be a surprise to anyone. (Expecting Lil Wayne to drop a classic album in 2015 is a little like expecting Michael Jordan to dunk from the free throw line every time he steps on the court in 2015: he can still get a little air, but consistent greatness has come and gone.) But the drama surrounding the album’s conception and release is quite compelling, even more than the album itself. Where is Tha Carter V, the long-awaited fifth entry in Wayne’s flagship album series? Is this a game-changing get for Tidal? And why does Weezy need to be freed in the first place? Tha Carter V had already been delayed several times We can trace the roots of Wayne’s quest for emancipation back to December 2014. Just a few days before Tha Carter V’s scheduled release — a release that had already been delayed several times — Wayne took to Twitter to announce that the album was being held back, and that it had nothing to do with him. He blamed the delay on his label, Cash Money, and Baby, the rapper / label co-founder / father figure also known as Birdman. He also expressed his desire to leave the label entirely. To all my fans, I want u to know that my album won't and hasn't been released bekuz Baby & Cash Money Rec. refuse to release it. This is not my fault. I am truly and deeply sorry to all my fans but most of all to myself and my family for putting us in this situation. I want off this label and nothing to do with these people but unfortunately it ain't that easy I am a prisoner and so is my creativity Again,I am truly sorry and I don't blame ya if ya fed up with waiting 4 me & this album. But thk u Wayne spent January tussling with Cash Money on both musical and legal fronts. He released Sorry 4 the Wait 2, a sequel to 2011’s Sorry 4 the Wait, on January 20th, an apology for Tha Carter V’s delay the same way the latter made up for the delayed release of Tha Carter IV. A few days later, he filed a massive lawsuit against Cash Money, one that demanded both his freedom from the label and $51 million in damages tied to the forced shelving of Tha Carter V. The lawsuit detailed all of the various agreements and settlements Wayne and Cash Money has reached in the 17 years since his signing in 1998, including amendments to his contract that increased in frequency and nebulousness as the release date of Tha Carter V approached. It also asked that Wayne be ruled the joint copyright owner of all records released on Young Money, his Cash Money imprint. This would include releases by artists like Drake, Nicki Minaj, and Tyga.   Wayne and Birdman were no longer speaking It became clear in February that Wayne wasn’t the only artist with bones to pick regarding Cash Money’s operation. Drake released full-length If You’re Reading This It’s Too Late without notice on February 13th, and made sure to take a few conspicuous shots at the label. The sharpest, from ""Star67"": ""Walk up in my label like, ‘Where the check, though?’ Yeah, I said it / Wouldn’t dap you with the left, ho."" He repurposed a track from Sorry 4 the Wait 2, ""Used To,"" just a few tracks later, making his allegiance clear. All of this served as fodder for fan and journalist theories regarding the terms of Drake’s contract with Cash Money, some of which were published just hours after the album was released. Speculation regarding its true purpose has slowed in the months since, but the music itself served to reinforce what Wayne was fighting to make clear on Twitter and in court: Cash Money had serious problems. In an interview with Rolling Stone, Wayne revealed the true depth of his rift with Birdman. They were no longer speaking, Tha Carter V was sitting on a hard drive somewhere ready for release, and he was moving on with work on what was then called The Free Weezy Album. Things quieted down over the next few months: the lawsuit was moved from New York to Louisiana, and Wayne kept chipping away at FWA. It wasn’t until June that he took his next step towards freedom from Cash Money by purchasing a stake in Tidal, Jay Z’s artist-centric streaming service, and releasing the album’s lead single, ""Glory,"" exclusively through said service. The mutual benefits of the partnership were immediately obvious: Wayne had a new platform for his music that was ostensibly separated from Cash Money — though the album’s publishing is still credited to Young Money, his subsidiary — and Tidal had a dispute they could neatly slot into their us-against-them promotional rhetoric. It’s easy to imagine Wayne on that infamous stage with Jay standing beside him: ""You can help to compensate Wayne fairly after years of his label failing to do the same!"" ""Glory"" came and went, but when FWA finally dropped on July 4th, it was exclusively available through the service. Exclusivity doesn't mean anything when your content is inessential Wayne and Tidal’s marriage may be natural, but it doesn’t solve the problem that’s looming over the service right now: exclusivity doesn’t mean anything when your content is inessential. When all of those famous musicians got on stage in March to announce their stake in Tidal, listeners weren’t swayed by their argument for direct artist support. If anything, that proposition became the greatest source of Tidal ridicule: if all of these people are already millionaires, why should potential paying subscribers feel compelled to make sure they get an even greater slice of the pie? Tidal’s greatest threat isn’t tied up in label politics or Spotify payouts. It’s the day when Beyoncé or Kanye or Rihanna decides to release their album through Tidal and Tidal alone, forcing their millions of fans interested in listening through legitimate means to hop on board. FWA is following in the footsteps of curated playlists, short, personal clips, and music videos like the star-studded one for ""Bitch I’m Madonna,"" and it’s the most enticing piece of exclusive content Tidal’s secured to date. It’s also nowhere near enough to render the service a must-subscribe. Wayne has been in creative free-fall for over half a decade at this point. His last vital singles were released two years ago, cut from the otherwise lackluster I Am Not a Human Being II; his last consistently great album turned seven years old a month ago. He’s still a commercial force, but his power in that arena is sapped with every new subpar release, and FWA isn’t doing anything to reverse that trend. If exclusivity is Tidal’s path to sustained relevance — and I don’t know how else they’d achieve it at this point — then it needs to work on two fronts: securing releases that move the needle for more than a night, and maintaining their true exclusivity until fans are too thirsty to ignore subscribing. If the service can’t manage that, it’s destined to fall by the wayside. We don't know if Tha Carter V will ever see the light of day At this point, it’s not clear whether or not Wayne will be granted freedom from Cash Money, or if Tha Carter V will ever see the light of day. His lawsuit against the label has yet to be resolved, and it’s the device Wayne will likely use to extricate himself from his contract. The album is now inextricable from those legal proceedings, and so it’s going to be a while before we hear more than the singles cut from it before Wayne and Birdman’s relationship fell apart. In the meantime, FWA is available for your listening pleasure — and it’s proof that Wayne might have to settle for short-term creative freedom in lieu of compensation.",0.32791738410369325,0.6720826158963067,0.8449541440358749,1415,4.75547703180212,681,6.0,0,0,"Culture, Entertainment, Essay, Music",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

The company added a much-needed subscription option earlier this year to help fix the otherwise crazy pricing structure PS Now had for game rentals, but there otherwise hasn't been much in the way of updates to speak of. That changes today — a major user interface update has just been pushed out to PlayStation Now on the PS4. The update was included in last week's PS4 software update, but Sony is just now turning it on. The old PS Now update was quite reminiscent of the design in Sony's PS Store on the PS3 and PS4, but the new design pulls a lot of visual cues from the PS Vue TV service that launched recently. The old PS Now interface featured some truly giant game tiles that only let you see a few options when you started the service up, but now there's a much more information-dense view. You'll see a set of featured games up top as well as recently added titles right below, and as you scroll down you'll see what's available in each genre of games PS Now features. From there, you can scroll horizontally to see all the games in that category. If PS Now is going to be the Netflix of games, it'll need more games It really does feel a lot like browsing Netflix — it's a much simpler and more streamlined interface than what existed before. There's really only three parts to it: the main grid view, a game's details, and then the screen that shows up when you actually launch a game. The game detail pages are much more visually interesting and modern-feeling, with huge artwork, nicely blurred backgrounds, and full-screen screenshots.   It's worth nothing that some of PS Now's somewhat confused history is still on display here — this new UI is available when you launch the PS Now app on the PS4, which only lets you try games if you're subscribed to the $19.99 monthly service. The rental aspect of PS Now is banished to the PS Store; it's confusing, but also probably for the best. The pricing for the rental model of PS Now remains completely broken, while the subscription service may offer enough value to find some traction. Sony just needs to keep adding more games — PS Now's subscription service has hovered around that 100 game mark for a long time now. And with the Xbox One's planned backwards compatibility with Xbox 360 games, PS Now is probably Sony's best tool at giving PS4 users similar capabilities.",0.7169381596503002,0.28306184034969983,0.1797075434972872,440,4.6204545454545451,250,5.4720000000000004,0,2,"Culture, Entertainment, Gaming",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

It's an important goal that the search giant hopes will allow programs to classify images just by ""looking"" at them, but there's one problem — to computers, our world looks like a horrible nightmare. The first images from Google's project, shown in June, reveal an organic hellscape inhabited by slug monsters and disembodied tentacles. The pictures show leaves that become two-headed birds, horses that grow dogs' heads from every inch of their skin, and humans whose bodies erupt in furry growths. To Google's computers, every surface of our world is covered in eyes. The artificial neural networks used by Google work out what's in an image by analyzing layers until they finally decide on what it shows. ""For example,"" Google engineers wrote in June, ""the first layer maybe looks for edges or corners. Intermediate layers interpret the basic features to look for overall shapes or components, like a door or a leaf. The final few layers assemble those into complete interpretations — these neurons activate in response to very complex things such as entire buildings or trees."" But while Google's code might be able to ascertain that a tree is indeed a tree, the image it builds from the original picture looks less like a harmless tree, and more like a glowing space temple for a cult of silently screaming bipedal monsters.   And now that code's loose. Instead of doing the sensible thing and destroying it, Google put everything you need to create your own neural network art on programming repository GitHub, calling it Deep Dream. Already it's capable of making art out of almost nothing. By plugging in a piece of random noise to a network tuned to look for specific places, the program can produce snapshots of science fiction worlds, building bridges, pagodas, and impossible spires out of wild colors as part of its attempts to find meaning in the randomness it's shown. Its creators say it'll be ""interesting"" to see what kind of art people can create with it.   ""Interesting"" is one word. ""Terrifying"" might be more accurate, especially when the code doesn't just work on still images — it can now be used on video too. Perhaps the scariest result so far has come from applying Deep Dream to Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. The movie's acid scene, already a pretty convincing case not to over-indulge in high-grade hallucinogens, becomes a vision of hell itself when viewed through the computer's eyes. Faces twist and morph as walls melt, blurring the lines between animate and inanimate, organic and inorganic. A man groans into the camera as a jet black eye rises from his throat. In the bathroom, Dr. Gonzo drops acid, his shoulders and arms rapidly turning into warped chickens. As he leaves, the floor becomes a giant salmon. The visual effect is Deep Dream trying to find patterns it recognizes, trying to get a bead on exactly what it's being shown, but the result is mightily unsettling. It makes me feel like all that money spent by Elon Musk on making sure we don't invent murderous AI is a good idea.

Its usage felt appropriate because discovering a new favorite song fills me with the kind of devout fanaticism militaries love. Julie Adenuga introduced me to my new favorite song on July 2nd during her inaugural shift on Beats 1 Radio. I was only half listening, as you do to the radio. Within two minutes my passive listening went active. Within three I was raising the volume. By the end I was as breathless as Adenuga, who said something like ""Whew, I need to calm down now."" Not me — I found the song and immediately started looping it. It’s been years since I’ve felt such passion for a new song. I’m not sure why, but I think the intensity is partly fueled by the process of discovery and the nostalgia I feel for the radio shows of my youth. My new favorite song has never appeared in my Spotify recommendations or the curated playlists that too frequently spoon-feed me songs from the same artists I already like. It took a DJ celebrating her favorite music to bring a new song to my attention from a ten-year-old band I didn’t know. I’ve probably listened to my new favorite song 50 times since then, often back to back to back; often making friends, colleagues, and family listen along. Sometimes they like it because they have great taste. Sometimes they don’t because they are wrong. I don’t care: it’s my new favorite song. This is my new favorite song: NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory has released an epic time-lapse video that chronicles the entire trip, from when Opportunity landed in late January of 2004 to when the rover passed the 26.2-mile mark in April of this year. The estimated figures for this quarter are particularly important because they're the first to factor in sales of Samsung's Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 Edge. The Korean company released its latest flagship phones in April, and both were expected to address the company's sliding profits after the launch of the disappointing Galaxy S5. While the newer phones helped Samsung claw its way back from the 30 percent year-on-year profit drop it experienced last quarter, like the S5, they still weren't enough to bring the firm's electronics division back to a position of growing profits.

On one side you have the so-called Internet of Things (IoT) characterized by too much technology. On the other side we have an equal and opposite force that tries to squelch technology and the bad habits we’ve developed around its usage. Let’s call it the Internot of Things (IøT). Both prey upon gullibility.   IoT devices are easy to spot because they’re often prefixed with the word ""smart"": the smart fork, smart chopsticks, smart cup, smart bottle, smart jar, smart bikini, smart bra, smart chair, smart kettle… you get the idea. Add a rechargeable battery and cheap Wi-Fi chip to any dumb object, develop an app, and voila: Indiegogo riches. Problem is, the result is always more expensive and bulkier than its contemporary and usually more finicky to use (what’s easier, hitting a light switch or fishing out a phone and launching an app?). IøT is a backlash to the onslaught of beeps, buzzes, and messages emitted by our ever-smarter world. Internot solutions are easy to spot because of their absurd approaches to tech avoidance. Examples include the Offline chair with its Wi-Fi blocking pocket. Or the Ostrich Pillow (pictured above) with its obvious social drawbacks. Ikea’s SITTING placemat also features a special pocket to ""hide"" your smartphone at dinner so that you can ""let go of the constant checking of social media updates."" You can even buy bedroom paint and leather carrying bags to block notification triggering wireless signals. Look, I’m a big fan of smart home technologies and gadgets, but a line has to be drawn at excess. Escaping technology shouldn’t require the purchase of another gadget. As Mat Honan once argued for Wired, ""the problem isn’t the technology — it’s you."" Every gadget I own was a purchasing choice — I also have the choice to turn them off. So do you.  While humans hem and haw about how to deal with the problems caused by drones, birds take a more straightforward approach: dive bomb anything that looks like a threat. An eagle in Australia has launched the latest attack on the invasive species, successfully taking out a reconnaissance drone from Melbourne Aerial Video. Not everyone needs or wants massive amounts of storage on their smartphone, but if you hate streaming your music and snap a lot of photos then this deal might be one for you. B&H is offering the Samsung Galaxy S6 with 128GB of storage for just $599.99 — slashing its list price by $400. Samsung said late last month that it was going to ""adjust"" the price of the S6 after disappointing earnings, but B&H's sale is still pretty notable. It's hardly the weirdest musician rider request ever — Van Halen famously demanded a bowl of M&Ms with all the brown candies removed and Mariah Carey wanted 20 kittens and 100 doves for unspecified purposes — but Pharrell Williams has entered pop star folklore with his latest tour's list of requirements. The ""Happy"" singer reportedly requests a photograph of dearly departed astronomer Carl Sagan in his dressing room, alongside specific brands of vodka, tequila, and grass-fed beef. Contrary to claims by British scientist Susan Greenfield that prolonged computer use can trigger ""autistic-like traits"" and aggression, the internet probably isn’t rotting youths' minds, experts say. A new editorial in the British Medical Journal argues that there isn't enough research to show that intense internet and computer use harms adolescent brains.

It's the only viable competitor to have kept pace with Apple's iPhone, and in its time it has stimulated grand battles between device manufacturers — first competing on specs, and now on price. All this competition has driven smartphone development forward at a blistering pace, and we're all profiting from it now, but it has its downsides, too. Today is a fitting day to take a closer look at those. HTC, once the leading Android smartphone maker, has just announced it will cut 15 percent of its workforce in response to dwindling sales. That's 2,300 people looking for new jobs. Lenovo, one of the relatively recent and still growing entrants in the mobile market, is also scything off 3,200 jobs as it tries to adjust to competitive pressures. Both companies consider China a key market, but neither is finding success against a group of competitors that is, in the words of Lenovo CEO Yang Yuanqing, ""playing irrationally."" Yesterday's mountaintop specs are on sale at rock-bottom prices today As if to back up Yang's words, Xiaomi has today introduced the 799 yuan ($125) Redmi Note 2, which has the same screen size and resolution as the iPhone 6 Plus and is powered by the same processor as HTC's One M9+. The Note 2 also has a microSD card slot, an IR blaster, and phase-detection autofocus (a flagship-tier feature first introduced in the Galaxy S5 and now present in the iPhone 6). All that for $125. Whatever profit, if any, Xiaomi is making on that phone is surely meager. And yet, Xiaomi knows that razor-thin margins for it are equivalent to major losses for its bigger competitors, who have to contend with the extra costs of maintaining a global support and distribution network. Even though Lenovo is also a Chinese company and well positioned to exploit the efficiencies that come from both manufacturing and selling phones in the same geography, it's simply not able to compete with an outfit like Xiaomi. And even as the latter company matures and takes on the costs associated with being an international phone vendor, there's a constant flow of anonymous upstarts ready to take its place, if only briefly. A recent study of Android device manufacturers found that there are now nearly 1,300 distinct brands of Android phones floating around. That's almost three times as many as there were in 2012, but it's a ridiculous number in its own right too. How can there be room for 1,300 different companies in a market where the biggest names are seemingly constantly mired in financial worries? The answer is that there isn't. Most of the companies in existence today are unlikely to still be here tomorrow. That's what Lenovo's CEO describes as the descent into irrationality: there are businesses selling Android phones, particularly in China, that simply do not concern themselves with remaining sustainable for any period of time beyond the nearest of horizons.   The situation is unfavorable for the manufacturers of Android phones, but it's not all that awesome for us, the consumers, either. We buy a lot of implicit assurances when we purchase a phone Say that you do buy the rock-bottom-priced, Shenzhen-produced Android phone with the lofty specs from a random brand. It has a replaceable battery, but where will you get one when you decide you want a spare? It runs the latest Android today, but who will ensure it does so tomorrow? And who will bear responsibility for any overheating issues or display flaws? We buy a lot of implicit assurances when we purchase a phone from an established brand. Even though HTC and Sony are struggling to keep their mobile divisions afloat, they will not disappear overnight. And even though their Android software updates could always be faster, these companies do at least endeavor to distribute them — and they are rightly pilloried when they fail. The current trend is to quietly discard these certitudes in the pursuit of ever-lower upfront cost. OnePlus is among the leaders in this field, but then you've also got companies like Yota, which secured a lot of YotaPhone 2 preorders via Indiegogo before canceling its US launch. Lenovo's American subsidiary Motorola is embracing a similar direct-to-consumer approach this year, skirting carrier arrangements to sell the new Moto X and Moto G at impressively low prices. But are any of these ventures truly sustainable? Why is no one talking about sustainability? Like an accelerated version of Moore's Law, smartphone prices have been steadily declining while their capabilities have been consistently improving. It's a beautiful trend that should be celebrated, but in order to keep it going, we need phone manufacturers to also be sustainable businesses. Right now, Apple and Samsung are doing alright, and Android is increasingly pivotal to Google's profitability, but almost everyone else in the smartphone business is flirting with disaster every quarter. This isn't going to lead to better customer service for us, or better working conditions for the people assembling our phones. If we want those things, we'll have to pay for them.",0.5983947810494415,0.40160521895055845,0.18758884971849102,865,5.0312138728323701,487,6.2607802874743328,0,0,"Google, Mobile, Tech, Essay",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The average American is now sitting or otherwise inactive for over eight waking hours per day — a figure which only rises with age — and no age group above 30 is committing more than 30 minutes to moderate or vigorous activity per day. All adults should aim for at least 150 minutes of physical activity per week — a broadly supported guideline that has been endorsed by the World Health Organization (WHO). However, the new BMJ papers suggest that even that modest goal might be too high for some people and the priority should be to avoid inactivity as much as possible.  The WHO identifies physical inactivity as ""the fourth leading risk factor for global mortality"" and estimates that it's caused 3.2 million deaths globally. Physically inactive people struggle against a variety of factors that discourage them from healthier lifestyles, according to the BMJ reports. Among them are ""inexperience with intense physical effort, associated fatigue and soreness, risk of injury and medical complications."" Older people, in particular, can feel alienated and face a limited availability of suitable facilities. ""Health benefits begin with any increase above the very lowest levels of activity."" Reviewing recent research into the health benefits of keeping active, Philipe Barreto of the University Hospital of Toulouse and a group led by Phillip Sparling of the Georgia Institute of Technology both find compelling evidence of a ""dose response"" to activity: every incremental increase brings with it a reduction in the risk of death or chronic disease and an improvement in cognitive and physical function. Their prescription is a familiar one — sit less and move around more — but both articles try to move the discussion away from specific goals and toward a more gradual (and, in their judgment, more realistic) approach. Having recently returned from the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, which was filled with amazing new experiences that a person can enjoy while sitting down, I felt compelled to get in touch with the authors of these studies to ask how they felt about the influence of technology on the goal of increasing activity. Neville Owen, from the Baker IDI Heart and Diabetes Institute in Australia, a co-author with Professor Sparling, is convinced we're doing more harm than good. He doesn't see the growing tide of wearable fitness devices designed to nudge us into being more active as offsetting the negative effects of ""the television set; the metabolically-toxic pairing of the chair and the workplace computer; and the automobile."" He's particularly troubled by the increasing commute times in urban areas, which, together with jobs anchored to desktop computers, are leading many of us to more sedentary habits. ""If technologies promoting physical activity and those promoting sedentary time reach a kind of balance is difficult to know."" Philipe Barreto, the author of the other study, is more equivocal in his assessment of technology's impact. He shares Owen's displeasure with the TV, saying that ""computers, television, and other tech inventions increase sedentary time,"" however he's more optimistic about the usefulness of pedometers, web-based health trackers, and even ""the increase of video-based physical activities."" Yes, there are technologies that keep us planted on our butts, but there are others — like Microsoft's Kinect, Nintendo's Wii motion controllers, and the new wave of VR headsets — that push us in the opposite direction. ""If technologies promoting physical activity and those promoting sedentary time reach a kind of balance is difficult to know,"" concludes Barreto, though ""physical inactivity is a highly prevalent behaviour worldwide and technological inventions are not the only or even the main culprit."" It's important not to paint the entire tech industry with the same brush, particularly when the latest and most detailed data about inactivity is being obtained with the help of accelerometers. The researchers are in agreement, however, that there are significant ill effects to our addiction to personal technology, which seem unlikely to be offset anytime soon.",0.6305338898835785,0.3694661101164215,0.5114573911259296,697,5.327116212338594,403,6.4590570719602978,0,0,"Science, Report",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

That includes Lapka, a company that makes a beautiful (albeit expensive) set of sensors for tracking humidity, radiation, and temperature in homes. Where that project was inspired by NASA and designer Yves Saint Laurent, the group has taken new inspiration from designer sneakers to come up with a set of conceptual sensors for Project Ara devices that promises to turn your phone into a portable health testing station. You might not be able to text or even fit your phone in your pocket, but you could find out if you're too drunk to drive. Project Ara is Google's idea to let you swap out nearly every component that's slotted to the back of your phone, the same way you'd swap out a battery. That's opened up the possibilities for everything from a battery-heavy phone for road warriors, to one that's got a huge lens for taking amazing pictures. The idea could also extend beyond phones to computers and other devices, which is where things get interesting.  Lapka's take is to turn a Project Ara device into a health scanner with seven concept modules that slot in the back. One measures air quality, while another tracks carbon dioxide. A third could serve as both a flashlight and a UV sensor. Lapka has also suggested a number of modules that tracks what's going on with your body, including a heart rate monitor, glucose sensor, and yes, even a breathalyzer (which the company has developed as a standalone product). Last but not least, there's a ""soul"" sensor, though Lapka says it ""can't talk about this one just yet."" Hmm. As concepts, there's no promise that these will arrive in the shape, size, and functionality Lapka is suggesting, but that's also true of Project Ara itself. Google gave us an update on its progress with Ara last week, noting that there's still much work to be done before these phones can even match what we're used to — things like reasonable battery life, and 4G LTE.

Thanks to a new partnership with Microsoft, the space agency is about to bridge the gap between robot and human exploration by using immersive augmented reality.   Windows Holographic and HoloLens made up one of the most exciting announcements at Microsoft’s big event this week. During and after the event, the demonstrations ranged from using the augmented reality goggles to play a living room-sized version Minecraft to working with a CAD-like software. But the most audacious demo was of OnSight, a program developed for HoloLens by NASA’s Ops Lab. It lets scientists explore a virtual Mars using data collected by the Curiosity rover. It's collaborative, too: scientists in different locations can join the session remotely, appearing in each other's HoloLens as humanoid avatars. Our own Tom Warren tried it out in Redmond and said it was jaw-dropping.   Ops Lab is in charge of building systems for controlling robots and spacecraft at NASA’s Jet Propulsion. Some of their projects include controlling articulating arms, building immersive environments, and controlling robots like Robonaut 2 and Athlete using technology like the Oculus Rift and a Kinect sensor. The Ops Lab team is already integrating OnSight into the Curiosity team’s software — so how did they get there? The partnership began over five years ago. During the Project Natal days of Microsoft’s Kinect, Ops Lab’s project manager Jeff Norris was introduced to Kinect (and HoloLens) creator Alex Kipman. The two hit it off. ""Our teams started talking about how we could use technologies that were being developed in his incubation group to better control robots and spacecraft,"" Norris tells me. Not long after that, Kipman showed Norris an early version of what would eventually become Windows Holographic and HoloLens. At that moment Norris says he knew there was potential, and they started figuring out how they could use it in space exploration. That collaboration resulted in a program that will expand the capabilities of the Curiosity team scientists. OnSight takes the data and images from the Curiosity rover and uses HoloLens to make a room appear to be the surface of Mars. Mission scientists will virtually step onto the surface and move around with an extra sense of perspective and presence not afforded by two-dimensional images, and that will improve the quality of conclusions drawn from things like shape and layout of geological features. HoloLens will also be aware of where a scientist's computer is, cutting it out of the virtual scene and letting a user control a mouse seamlessly between the desktop and the surface. Curiosity scientists will mostly interact with OnSight by using the global interactions built into Holographic. There are gesture and voice controls, and each scientist’s avatar has a ""gaze ray"" that draws a line to what they’re looking at, making it easier for other participants to follow along. Being able to use a computer while wearing HoloLens — another part that impressed us in Redmond — will let scientists take advantage of the raw data available in MSLICE, a program that provides the raw data from Curiosity that has been fully integrated with OnSight. The Ops Lab team views presence — whether real or virtual — as a critical tool for the explorer. ""What a geologist is doing when they’re looking at a scene is they’re trying to understand a story that this environment has to tell them,"" Norris says. ""One of the chapters of that story is the shape of the environment — the way that the rocks are worn, the way that they form lines and curves. That information is one of the ways that they divine what’s happening.""     More surprisingly, Norris says the scientists were accomplishing this increased accuracy without any basic VR or AR training — only one of the people in the admittedly few person study had ever even worn a head-mounted display before. ""That’s what really put the wind in our sails to go further with this,"" Norris says. While the Curiosity team has already been able to do great work with two- and three-dimensional images of the surface, OnSight is the next evolved step in how they analyze the data. It’s a better option than viewing a 3D-model (or stereoscopic images) because of the power of proprioception, or the body’s sense of self. ""Your body, as you’re walking around in a place on Earth, knows where it is. And your eyes are presenting to your brain images of what you see at that position,"" says Norris. The integration of those things is essential to building a mental model of your environment, and it’s why the Ops Lab team is so excited about the work they’ve done with OnSight. Ops Lab was already working on immersive interaction, using an Oculus Rift. But the Rift presented its limitations for NASA, like its need for wires and how it closes users off from their surroundings. HoloLens relieves both of those problems, so the Ops Lab team started an  intense development period about a year ago to create OnSight — so intense that a portion of Norris’s team actually moved to Redmond to live and work shoulder to shoulder with the HoloLens team. Ultimately, the goal is to test OnSight in actual operations later this year, though Norris couldn’t say when. But Curiosity scientists already professed excitement in a video released this week by JPL. Geologist Fred Calef says not only is OnSight ""like teleportation,"" but it will also save time. Katie Stack Morgan says the enhanced visualization will help the team make better decisions about operating the rover in general — an important issue considering the problems the team has had with things like wheel degradation. That doesn’t mean OnSight is close to being a finished product. ""There’s a lot of work to do,"" Norris says. ""It’s no trivial undertaking to bring a new capability into mission operations.""

So far, five Disneyland employees have been diagnosed with measles, a highly contagious disease that typically begins with a high fever, runny nose, and bloodshot eyes, before leading to a red rash.

Last year, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported 644 cases across 27 states, the most since 2000.

Having written about a number of women’s health issues, I jumped at the opportunity. I wanted to be among the first to try this rare breed of women-focused technology: a device that isn’t about losing weight, getting pregnant, or having orgasms.  But after spending two days trying out the kGoal, I had to admit defeat. It might be a great product for some women, but it certainly isn’t for me — that thing hurt like hell.    ""Kegels"" are pelvic muscle exercises, named after Arnold Kegel, the man who first described them in 1948. Women can do Kegels by contracting and relaxing the muscles of their pelvic floor — an act that basically means squeezing and releasing the muscles around their vagina and anus, sort of like you would if you were trying to stop the flow of urine. The main benefit of doing Kegels on a regular basis is that they can help women avoid or reduce incontinence, a problem that can affect women of all ages and of all backgrounds, notably athletes who take part in high impact sports. Kegels may also improve a woman's orgasm — because having bigger, stronger muscles in that area helps women enhance vaginal stimulation. Pelvic floor exercises may also strengthen posture. having bigger, stronger muscles helps women enhance vaginal stimulation There's a problem with Kegels, though: a lot of women end up doing them wrong. In a 2014 study, researchers reported that 23 percent of women who do Kegels do them incorrectly. This is unfortunate. When Kegels are done right, women show up to 70 percent improvement in stress incontinence symptoms, regardless of their age. That's why Minna Life came up with the kGoal, a Kegel exerciser made out of medical-grade silicone, that helps women do Kegels the right way. ""You can tell if you're just using your glute muscles because it won't vibrate in the way that it does if you actually squeeze with your pelvic floor muscles,"" Liz Miracle, a pelvic floor physical therapist and a consultant for Minna Life, told me. ""So it does tell you if you're doing the contraction correctly or not."" I met with Minna Life CEO Brian Krieger and consultant Liz Miracle last week, a day before I tried it out myself. ""We are very female empowered focused,"" Miracle said. ""It's not about your partner being more satisfied with your pelvic floor muscles — it's about you and your connection with yourself, and you feeling good about yourself and your strength.""  Minna Life is mostly known for its sex toys — you may have seen the ""limon"" in sex shops like Babeland. But last year, the company launched a Kickstarter that didn't have anything to do with sex, at least not directly. Krieger isn’t sure how the idea for the kGoal came about. ""We’ve been  excited about the idea of doing something that’s pelvic fitness-oriented for years and years and years,"" he said. Miracle, for her part, found out about the project through a friend, and was intrigued. She had wanted to develop a pelvic exercise device for quite some time, but had had trouble finding the right team. ""The attitude was the biggest thing,"" she said. ""If I was going into a room with guys trying to make vaginas tighter to make men happy, then I was not going to be a part of this team."" Luckily, Minna Life’s intention behind the product aligned  with hers. There's definitely a consumer interest. The kGoal crowdfunding campaign attracted 2200 backers who contributed $266,917 — surpassing the original $90,000 funding goal by $176,917. After the campaign ended, the company received around 800 additional pre-orders for the $150 product. The Kickstarter shipments are set to begin this week, Krieger said, and they expect to see more orders after the kGoal's launch today. Both Krieger and Miracle think the kGoal has the potential to lead in the  Kegel exerciser market. It's different from other offerings, like the Skea,  because the app shows the user when they aren't completely relaxing their muscles. ""A lot of women have trouble relaxing their muscles all  the way,"" Miracle said. The device hasn't been tested by an  independent evaluator, but both Miracle and Krieger say it works. ""I've  seen women who leak urine [in my practice], and they're leaking less urine over time as they use the product,"" Miracle said. ""They're getting  stronger with their pelvic floor muscles."" kGoal is a silicone device with two handles. The smaller handle stays outside the body; it contains the start button, the battery, and the Bluetooth antenna. The large oblong handle is inserted in the vagina. The sides of the larger handle can be deflated to make the ""installation process"" easier. But it doesn't deflate completely — the device's bulbous tip is rigid. That part contains the internal tactile feedback motor, Krieger told me in an email. It was also kept rigid because it ""helps prevent [the kGoal] from  slipping out while in place.""  when a woman contracts her muscles more tightly, the vibration intensifies The kGoal works by giving users tactile feedback through an optional proportional vibration feature: when a woman contracts her muscles more tightly, the vibration intensifies. When she lets go, the vibration stops. Women also have the option of looking at their progress on the accompanying cell phone app; the kGoal connects to your phone through Bluetooth and tracks your progress through time. When the app launches in the Apple store, it will have one workout available that focuses on both strength and speed. I tested it by holding the kGoal in my hand, and it seemed to work well. Minna Life couldn't give me access to the app at home, however, so I wasn't able to test it out under real-life conditions. That night, I went home and hung out with my partner and one of our friends. We discussed what trying the kGoal might be like. Our friend suggested that my experience with the kGoal might resemble that of Peggy Olson, a Mad Men TV character, when she tried the ""Relax-a-Cizor"" — a vibrating panty-shaped pleasure device that advertisers in the show marketed as a weight loss machine to avoid offending 1960s husbands. ""Have a good day tomorrow!"" our friend said with a knowing smile as she left. The next day, I stayed home from work. I felt confident as I removed the kGoal from its packaging. Miracle had given me a tutorial about how the device worked 24 hours earlier, so I figured the process would be simple. To deflate the device, you press the button at its base and press on its sides. Then, you guide it in. Once you've inserted the device, you press on the button at the base again to inflate it again. The kGoal can also be adjusted, so that you can use it while standing up or doing lunges. I didn't expect to be able to do any of that just yet, however — you need to build up to it, Miracle told me. I got my first hint of the pain to come when I deflated the kGoal alone for the first time. Back at the office, it had seemed small in my palm, but when it finally came time to face the task at hand, I suddenly noticed how large the device's bulbous tip — the part that doesn't deflate — actually is. I made use of the 95% organic lube packages that come with the device. I was gentle at first, but it refused to go in. I focused on what Miracle had told me. The pain wasn't subsiding. Now I had to get the damn thing out ""Make sure you're relaxed when you go to put it in, specifically if you're squeezing the muscles,"" she said. ""You should lay down, and open your legs up and relax."" Since I was already laying down, I decided to close my eyes for a minute or so. Then, I tried again. This time, I used more force and the kGoal went in. From that moment on, my vagina was on fire. ""Maybe once I inflate it, and the kGoal is turned on, it'll feel better,"" I thought. I followed the procedure that Miracle had described. Eventually, I managed to clench my muscles twice, and I immediately felt the kGoal vibrate in response. Still, after two wimpy Kegels, I was done. ""This shit is crazy,"" I said out loud. The pain wasn't subsiding. Now I had to get the damn thing out. The only way I can describe what taking the kGoal out felt like is by asking Verge readers who menstruate to imagine the most painful experience they've ever had with a tampon. Then, take that pain and triple it — that's what taking the kGoal out felt like. By the end of the first attempt, I was covered in sweat. I took some time to recover. Here is my first journalistic impression of the device, as received by my editor: ""Holy shit that kGoal thing is PAINFUL. Jesus. WTF. Whyyyyy."" Shortly after that I emailed Miracle to tell her about my experience. I asked her for tips about how to make using the kGoal less painful. ""The best way to insert is to be semi-reclined, legs out like in butterfly pose, deep breathe, exhale as you insert. Use lubricant as well,"" she wrote back the next day. ""Also, you can try exhaling and bearing down slightly to remove."" If the purpose of this product is for women to gain control, then I was doing just that by putting the KGoal away I decided to give the kGoal another try. This time, I didn't get very far. As soon as I began wondering why I was putting myself through this again, I stopped. Women don't listen to their bodies enough, and if the purpose of this product is for women to gain control, then I was doing just that by putting the kGoal away. According to Miracle, the kGoal was sized to fit most women. ""There will be cases where it is uncomfortable to insert,"" she said. ""Trying to find a size that works for all women is nearly impossible, so we did user testing to arrive at a size that would be insertable for most."" According to Krieger, Minna Life tested the kGoal on around 20 women. After two separate attempts, I can safely say that kGoal isn't my idea of a good, or even acceptable pelvic floor workout. But I'm not going to pretend that every kGoal backer will have a similar experience. I asked a friend to try it out on Saturday. She told me that although she was able to use it, inserting it was painful, and so was taking it out. She admitted that the vibration triggered by the contractions was pleasurable however. ""I wouldn't buy it though,"" she said. one-size-fits-all products rarely deliver on that promise Of course every woman — and every vagina, for that matter — is different. I found the kGoal exceedingly unpleasant. But it does seem to work pretty well, and the app appeared to be well-designed, based on the brief period I spent with it. I can only conclude that it isn't right for me. Others might find it easy to use — they might even love it. And if that's the case, it may really benefit them in some measurable way. Krieger says that his company is thinking of making a smaller version of the product. ""We don't have concrete plans yet,"" he wrote in an email. Right now, the focus is on getting the initial version going. From a business perspective, I can see how that would make sense: build a market for your product, and then expand your line. But let's be honest, one-size-fits-all products rarely deliver on that promise, especially when it comes to women's bodies. Paying $150 for the kGoal might be worth it for many, but it's hard to know before you actually try it — and honestly if I wanted to spend $150 on torture devices, I'd buy a new pair of heels.

Today, Science has published seven reports based on data from Rosetta, a spacecraft that has spent the past 10 years traveling to a comet nearly 280 million miles away. The European Space Agency launched the mission in 2004, but it wasn’t until last year that it reached its destination: a comet with the ungainly name of 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. The ESA and NASA successfully put Rosetta into orbit around 67P in August, and they dropped a lander onto the surface in November — both historical firsts. And for the past five and a half months, scientists have been able to use Rosetta's bevy of instruments to gather information on everything from the water ions in 67P’s atmosphere to the composition of its barbell-shaped core. Comets are like a time capsule from the birth of the solar system Comets can give us a unique perspective on our own world, says University of Michigan professor Nilton Renno, a co-investigator in the 2007 Mars Phoenix mission. A comet is hypothetically formed from dust and gas present at the solar system’s formation — a time capsule from before our planet existed. ""If you understand well the composition of the comet, you understand very well the composition of the cloud of dust that formed the entire solar system,"" Renno says. The very first Rosetta findings, published in December, are an excellent example. Using a mass spectrometer, researchers examined the makeup of 67P’s ice, comparing its composition to our own water. The stark differences they found contradicted an earlier hypothesis about comets: that they had brought water to Earth by slamming into the newly formed planet. We don’t know enough to settle this or many other questions, but Rosetta could provide us with the most accurate information yet.  Smooth terrain on 67P's Imhotep region. 67P is far from the first comet to come under investigation. NASA’s Stardust mission flew by a comet in 2004 and returned to Earth carrying particles gathered from around a comet, and its Deep Impact mission launched a probe straight into one in 2005, transmitting images just before impact. But it’s the first time a craft has gotten so close for so long. Some researchers believe they could be correcting otherwise unavoidable biases with this approach. ""This is really a big advantage,"" says Alessandra Rotundi of the Parthenope University of Naples, principal investigator of Rosetta’s Grain Impact Analyzer and Dust Accumulator (GIADA) sensor. Using GIADA — a black box that measures particles’ speed and momentum using a laser screen and impact sensors — Rotundi and her team could measure the size and density of dust grains in the ""coma,"" the fuzzy cloud that surrounds a comet’s core. The coma is formed as the comet heats up, parts of its solid nucleus turning directly to gas. Rosetta’s extended time near the comet will allow them to observe how 67P’s dust / gas ratio changes as it approaches the sun, and its close proximity will eliminate some sources of confusion. ""A flyby is really short in time; it's also fast, and so it can cause issues in the measurements,"" says Rotundi. ""It would have been much more difficult to know the velocity of each single grain."" More accurate readings on the coma will give researchers information about what the comet itself is made of — and, by extension, when and where it was formed. Comet flybys can gather some of the same information as Rosetta, but not in the same detail Other researchers are tackling the same question from different angles. One group used OSIRIS — Rosetta’s high-resolution camera system — to analyze the shape, size, and movement of the comet’s nucleus, a pair of lobes separated by a short neck. Using mass data from another instrument, they estimated the density as less than half that of water, suggesting that it could be loosely packed and highly porous. The results corroborated other, less certain findings from other comets, providing a better sense of their makeup. Another examined OSIRIS images to model the comet’s surface, creating a terrain map and finding variations that could indicate different materials or environments in different parts of the nucleus, and others used microwaves or infrared imaging to measure subsurface temperatures or the material on the comet’s surface — the latter suggests that despite the icy overall nature of comets, there’s little visible ice on its sunlit side. One of the major questions in this research is whether the comet’s two lobes were originally separate bodies, or whether the ""neck"" in the middle has simply been hollowed out over time — although researchers have found notable differences between the parts, the issue remains unsettled. Partly, this is because there are still so many gaps in our understanding of comets. A study led by Myrtha Hässig of the Southwest Research Institute, for instance, looked at the combination of water, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide in 67P’s coma. The results were surprising: over Rosetta’s first two months in orbit, its instruments found that the gas composition changed significantly as it moved. ""We see big variations of water and CO/CO2"" as the comet rotates under the spacecraft, says Hässig, ""and that we had not expected. We expected to see a steady increase once we entered the coma.""  Rosetta's GIADA instrument measures comet dust. These variations could be happening because the nucleus itself isn't uniform; if that's true, it might mean that the different pieces come from different parts of the solar system. But Hässig says interpreting the data isn't easy. For one thing, the sun’s heat produces the coma, and it doesn’t hit all parts of the comet equally. At least some of these changes are the equivalent of a seasonal effect; water, for instance, is only released at a higher temperature, so it’s more common on the comet’s ""summer"" side. It’s not clear right now whether a comet’s makeup also plays a part. The paper compares 67P to another comet called Hartley-2, which also had variations that could come from a heterogeneous nucleus. But Hartley-2 was only measured briefly, during a flyby. ""It was basically just a snapshot of the coma and the nucleus,"" says Hässig. Rosetta's mission will continue until the end of 2015 Rosetta scientists, though, have at least another year to collect data. The craft has a planned life of 12 years, though the official mission ends in December of 2015, once the comet has reached its closest point to the sun and continued on its 6.5-year orbit. They’ll be able to observe how the coma’s composition changes, as well as other properties — like the development of a ""magnetosphere"" that insulates comets and other celestial bodies from solar winds. A project led by Hans Nilsson of the Swedish Institute of Space Physics is tracking the way that ultraviolet light excites water molecules as the comet heads towards the sun, creating ions that will eventually form a barrier against the winds. Like the coma, the magnetosphere grows near the sun and shrinks away from it, and Nilsson says this mission is the first time we’ll be able to actually watch one develop. Renno says that despite the benefits of Rosetta’s lander, there are downsides to analyzing material in space. The equipment, for instance, has to be lightweight and low-power enough to run off large solar panels, which means it may be less accurate than the state of the art on Earth — it’s just not worth the tradeoff of having to get samples home. The biggest limit to these studies, though, is the relatively short time Rosetta has been in orbit. ""There is a lot of stuff we didn't expect, certainly,"" says Hässig. ""I think we will be further surprised by Rosetta and the results. And we will have to rethink, or wrap our mind around, how comets actually formed in a new way.""",0.7522069816521659,0.24779301834783407,0.1901364437530836,1331,5.0195341848234412,643,6.3343701399688959,0,4,"Science, Report",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

E-cigarettes produce high levels of formaldehyde-releasing chemicals at high voltages, according to a letter published in the New England Journal of Medicine today. Given that formaldehyde is well-documented carcinogen, the finding lends support to the idea that e-cigarettes should be subjected to greater regulations — an idea that the FDA plans to rule on soon. ""formaldehyde in the liquid droplet particles in the aerosol."" ""We simulated vaping by drawing the vapor — the aerosol — into a syringe, sort of simulating the lungs,"" David Peyton, a chemist at Portland State University who participated in the study, told NPR. ""To our surprise, we found masked formaldehyde in the liquid droplet particles in the aerosol."" E-cigarettes don't give off smoke. Users inhale a vapor that's created by heating a nicotine-containing liquid instead. Liquids sometimes taste better at specific temperatures, so users have to adjust the voltage and wattage of the e-cigarette to obtain optimal results. Adjusting these parameters can also affect the amount of vapor produced. The researchers didn't detect formaldehyde-releasing agents at low voltage levels (3.3V). When vapor was produced at high levels (5.0V), however, they found that the e-cigs actually produce higher levels of formaldehyde-releasing agents than the level of gaseous formaldehyde released by traditional cigarettes. Assuming that these agents carry the same risks as the gaseous formaldehyde produced by regular cigarettes, the lifetime risk of cancer of vaping might be between five and 15 times as high as the risk associated with long-term cigarette use, the researchers conclude. ""I think this is just one more piece of evidence amid a number of pieces of evidence that e-cigarettes are not absolutely safe,"" Peyton told NPR. Because vaping doesn't involve smoke, many users believe that e-cigarettes are less harmful than cigarettes. But researchers have found that e-cigarette vapor contains high levels of nanoparticles that can cause inflammation in the lungs and increase a user's risk of cardiovascular and respiratory disease. And a review published last year concluded that it's too early to tell what the long-term effects of vaping might be. ""Anyone using the vapor product at the high setting would tap out."" The vaping industry has dismissed the findings. Gregory Conley, president of the American Vaping Association, told The Verge that the way in which the researchers tested the e-cigarettes was improper. ""This machine study used conditions that in no way replicated how actual human beings use vapor products,"" he says. ""Anyone using the vapor product at the high setting would tap out — would stop using the product after two or three puffs — because it is that unpleasant of an experience."" Conley also points out that when the e-cigarettes were used properly, ""no formaldehyde was detected."" Both the American Association for Cancer Research and the American Association for Clinical Oncology have called for stricter regulations of e-cigarettes. Vaping pens aren't regulated at the moment, but the FDA issued a proposal in April 2014 that could change that.

Rover teams still have a tough time with the Martian surface even though they're flush with terrestrial data. The alien surface is uneven, and ridges and valleys make navigating the terrain difficult. The newest solution proposed by JPL is the Mars Helicopter, an autonomous drone that could ""triple the distances that Mars rovers can drive in a Martian day,"" according to NASA. The helicopter would fly ahead of a rover when its view is blocked and send Earth-bound engineers the right data to plan the rover's route. The rover teams could also use images from the helicopter to select features for further study, giving them a much closer option than the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and its HiRISE camera, which is over 150 miles above the surface.

Together they employ nearly a million people and do almost $250 billion in annual sales. But they can all trace their origins back to one, in Missouri, built in 1905 with a gardening hose. What began as a side business for a handful of pharmacies became a massive industry because Henry Ford's Model T quickly became so popular that there was suddenly stable demand for everything from gas stations to mechanics. Now, Elon Musk and Tesla are trying to create their own nationwide network of stations to dispense electricity, not gas — perhaps as much as its cars themselves, this network of chargers will determine Tesla's future. And apparently it's not going to take very long to build. There are currently 103 Tesla Supercharger stations in the US, which are the best and fastest ways to charge Tesla cars. But last May, that number was nine. And by the end of 2015, Tesla says it will cover 98 percent of the US population, which means with a little foresight there really won't be anywhere you can't take your Model S. That coincides with a dramatic expansion in Europe, and a much less dramatic expansion in Asia. (Even 15 stations doesn't seem like enough for several billion people.) And that's all not to mention Tesla's real secret weapon: people can refill their cars at home, which means Tesla will never need as many stations as the Model T did. If every Tesla owner's home counts as a station, it might pass 121,446 without trying very hard. New data shows that sales of plug in electric vehicles hit a record high in May of 2014. Tesla reported its quarterly earnings this afternoon, notching a profit thanks to record deliveries of its Model S. It led its announcement with news about battery production and announcing record car sales, and the growth of its Supercharger network figures to be a big part of the company's present and future. Here is the next phase of Tesla's world-blanketing Supercharger plan, in three maps.  In the United States, Tesla plans to cover 98 percent of the population with Supercharger stations by the end of 2015, meaning you'll never do a drive longer than the distance between chargers. Even in Montana.  Tesla's plan is to let you drive anywhere in Europe in a Model S and never run out of charge. You'll have to be a little more careful with your route, but it'll be doable.

How does that work?  Weaning America off its gasoline addiction is hard. If it wasn’t, we’d have done it already. It certainly doesn’t help that great electric cars are tough to make, which means the best ones are expensive. What’s more, charging infrastructure is still in its infancy — you can’t drive anywhere you want with complete certainty that you’ll be able to put electrons back in the tank. Even when you can, recharging is a lot slower than pumping a few gallons of fossil fuel and going on your way.  Tesla believes in simply ripping the Band-Aid off — all of its models are pure electric, growing pains of immature technology and infrastructure be damned. GM, the very seat of the automotive establishment, is moving with every ounce of caution that Tesla has shrugged off.  With the launch of the Chevy Volt in 2010, GM hedged its bets with what it calls the “extended-range electric” drivetrain, offering a limited range of pure electric operation supplemented by gasoline that offers unlimited travel as long as you can keep finding gas stations. For what you get, the Volt is reasonably expensive: it starts at over $34,000 for a car with less passenger space than the $17,520 Cruze.  Now, imagine stuffing basically the same drivetrain into a Cadillac. That’s the ELR. And it’s $75,000. That’s the cost of a Tesla Model S. Filled with 9 gallons of 91 octane, it’s the anti-Tesla.  Actually, the ELR provided to me by GM clocked in just north of $82,000 for a car that is ostensibly a tarted-up Volt. That’s some $12,000 more than a base Model S, which offers 208 miles of all-electric range compared to the ELR’s 37. It’s also over $40,000 more than the outgoing (but similar-looking) CTS coupe equipped with a traditional gasoline engine.  Has GM lost its mind? I had a week and a 900-mile road trip from GM’s hometown of Detroit to Oshkosh, Wisconsin and back to find out. It’s a sleek car. ""It looks fast standing still"" is a cliché in automotive circles, but it applies particularly to the ELR, which looks like a wedge designed to obliterate headwind at all costs. It’s one of the rare cases where the concept car — 2009’s Converj — is almost indistinguishable from the production model, a far cry from the Volt’s sad translation from concept to family-hauler reality. The futurism continues on the interior, which generally looks great. It helps that GM delivered me a dark silver car over a rich, dark brown leather interior, which is a killer combination with just the right amount of contrast. Suede-like Alcantara blends with carbon fiber and wood along all the surfaces, mated to Cadillac’s glossy Cue system in the center stack. The instrument cluster is just one big LCD display — a popular trend among automakers lately — broken up by a faux gauge bezel to visually differentiate data points. The driver can select from a small handful of ""skins"" for the cluster, all of which put a focus on communicating energy consumption in one way or another. I won’t dwell on Cue because it’s essentially the same as the system that Cadillac has been using for the past couple years, but it needs a lot of work. It’s slow — I’d even argue that it’s dangerously slow. Operations that should be instantaneous (switching between radio and navigation controls, for instance) often took multiple seconds, distracting me and taking my eyes off the road for far longer than would be considered reasonable. Animations on the moving map — changing zoom level, showing upcoming turns, so on — never exceeded 6 or 8 fps, visibly stuttering the entire time. The processors used in cars aren’t bound to the same power-sipping requirements that phones are, yet Google Maps on my Nexus 5 consistently ran circles around Cue. It doesn’t make sense. GM needs to throw considerably more processing power at this system, but ultimately, it might simply come down to technologies like CarPlay and Android Auto taking over and putting these proprietary systems to shame.  Fortunately, driving this car is a lot less frustrating than interacting with it. Mashing the accelerator doesn’t glue you to the back of your seat the way a proper sports car might, but it’s not a slouch, either. Then again, most cars with electric drivetrains really benefit from the even torque distribution afforded by their motors: they feel like they’re pulling you forward with gusto no matter your speed or situation. Engine RPM — which starts to lose meaning in hybrid and electric drivetrains — simply becomes a non-issue. The transition between electric and gasoline modes is seamless and so quiet that I barely ever noticed the engine was even running. But the ELR, no matter how fast it looks, was never about speed or performance anyway: it’s about feeling reasonably good about your stewardship of the planet’s finite resources while looking good (and kind of rich) doing so. To that end, the bulk of the car’s eco-friendliness ends after around 40 miles, at which point the electric power takes a back seat and the car acts more like a conventional hybrid — it can lean heavily on the battery in short bursts, but the engine is usually turned on. It’s really no different from a Prius at that point. That’s not a bad place to be as fuel economy goes; I consistently got close to 40 mpg on my journey. But for the price of this little coupe with room for a couple small humans in back and a couple moderately sized bags in the trunk, you could buy three Priuses. Three. Of course, you can save some money by running on electric. Charging is easy enough, it works just like any other electric car  — when you can find a charger. I was driving through rural parts of the Midwest where proper level 2 chargers are ghosts. Like the Volt, the ELR comes with a portable charger that works with standard 120-volt outlets, winds around itself for storage, and looks a little bit like an industrial power extension cord, but I ran into a number of outlets that it didn’t like. To make sure charging goes smoothly (read: no fires), the portable charger is designed to be finicky, glowing an ominous red LED to let you know you’re out of luck. Even if you can get it working, though, it can take 18 hours to top off the batteries. With level 2 charging, a full charge comes in about four hours, which makes the ELR a great city car: urban areas are more likely to have chargers handy, and 37 miles is enough range to scoot around without sipping any gas. But the reality is that the ELR is designed like a grand tourer — a comfortable coupe with a cabin so quiet you can hear a pin drop. You don’t want to drive a few blocks, you want to drive it across the country. There’s something to be said for the unlimited range of a gasoline engine, but you can’t shake the feeling that you’re cheating, or that the electric mode is somehow make-believe. Certainly on my 900-mile trip, I spent the overwhelming majority of the time running on old-school internal combustion. Once you get over the realization that this isn’t much of an electric car, the question becomes: what’s the exact price that you ascribe to the raw fabulousness that the ELR affords? Because truly, this car is fabulous. No one is arguing that. I got wide-eyed looks everywhere I drove, and I never got tired of looking at it myself. It simply doesn’t look like anything else on the road. It’s stylish, it’s comfortable, it’s commanding. There are precious few production vehicles that look as though they were imported directly from the future; this is one of them. But when you frame the ELR for what it really is — a compact hybrid coupe — Cadillac just doesn’t have the brand cachet for this sticker price. I loved it, and I would drive a free one to the ends of the earth and back. I might even pay close to $50,000 for the pleasure, but certainly not $82,000. So yes, GM is indeed out of its mind. Fortunately, with the ELR, it’s out of its mind in the most entertaining and enjoyable way possible.

In The New America, Costa animates his entire story using a new block of wood for each frame. Over 800 pieces of maple were laser engraved, largely featuring geometry patterns, trippy abstract forms, and foreboding takes on major American icons like George Washington and the White House. The wood's grain flows by as the short film goes on, and eerie, electronic ambience plays over it all, helping to create an unsettling, awe-inspiring look at the advanced landscapes the animation unveils.   Kickstarter backers picked up the maple engravings While Costa says that the storyline is abstract, he explained the basis of it in a Kickstarter video: ""It’s set in a fictitious place and time where a very advanced society goes through a phase of structural and financial collapse but eventually reemerges, and its values are rooted in a strong relationship with nature."" His Kickstarter campaign finished nearly two years ago, bringing in just over $30,000 to create the film. Most backers received a single frame used in the film, and he's still selling the remaining ones today. The New America premiered earlier this week on Vimeo, after taking nearly two years to create due to what Costa says were various issues and delays. He's been keeping busy during that time though, creating commercials and other shorts, including a stop-motion video for Google's debut of Chrome on Android. Costa doesn't say whether he plans to make another film this way (""It was a lot of hard work and stress,"" he writes) but he does write that if he were to try it again, he'd plan ahead more, perhaps cutting down on the production time.",0.6102488426444294,0.38975115735557064,0.7796545366613458,295,4.9152542372881358,207,5.6473429951690823,0,0,"Culture, Design, Entertainment, Watch This",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1

Now, a Kickstarter-backed pair of designers are bringing the meme-enabling moving pictures into the physical plane using a method invented in the 1940s. Lenticular technology was developed more than 70 years ago Sha Hwang and Rachel Binx have started a company called Gifpop! and are using lenticular film to print GIFs. You'll likely recognize lenticular film from the front of childhood notebooks and stationery: it's a ridged plastic surface that, when tilted, produces a moving image. It's not particularly high-tech stuff — The New York Times reports that lenticular technology was developed during World War II — but advances in fidelity have meant that Gifpop! will be able to produce cards that display a GIF-like range of motion.  Gifpop!'s Kickstarter launched yesterday and was funded almost immediately. The GIF is more than 26 years old and is still the best medium for showing frolicking dogs, but it's also rapidly becoming the file format of choice for internet artists. Some of Hwang and Binx's first lenticular cards feature works created by GIF artists including mr div, davidope (above), and 89-A. The Atlantic reports the two designers were inspired in their venture by Cards Against Humanity, another card-based Kickstarter success. Hwang imagined a Cards Against Humanity-style game played with reaction GIF cards: ""One card would say, ‘My face when I see my ex with her new boyfriend,' and then players would put reaction GIF cards down."" Gifpop! still has 25 days of its Kickstarter campaign to go and hopes to ship its first custom cards to backers in November.

A permit is usually issued in a month, and sources close to the plans tell us the design is unlikely to be opposed.  The striking structure has been amended slightly since we first saw it. The initial sketches saw steel bars spiraling down from the building's round tips, but in the new design those regimented spirals have been replaced with a ""geometrically organic"" pattern that the architects (multinational firm NBBJ) describe as ""visually lighter"" and ""sculptural.""

The Olympic stadium's original budget was less than half of the current figure, but grew by an extra ¥170 billion as the costs of demolition and infrastructure creation became clear. The existing national stadium — built for the 1964 Olympics — will be knocked down next year to make room for the planned building. The rest of the site is currently a park: such space and greenery, as Reuters points out, is a precious commodity in central Tokyo. The downscaling comes after experts and architects complained Shimomura's comments come after a cabal of experts raised complaints over the scale of the Tokyo 2020 Olympics' central stadium. Pritzker Architecture Prize winner Fumihiko Maki recently requested the stadium be rethought to be ""more sustainable,"" claiming he had the support of a hundred prominent figures. Maki questioned the project's ""damaging effects on historical scenery,"" queried the ""exorbitant"" cost of construction and management, and raised concerns about evacuation from the stadium in the case of natural disaster.

Target's payment systems, by contrast, were compromised by malware for around three weeks between late November and mid-December of 2013; Target has about 1,800 US branches. Besides Target, the Secret Service has said that over a thousand other US businesses have been affected by that malware. According to Krebs' previous reporting, Sally Beauty, Neiman Marcus, restaurant chain PF Chang's, and others have all had point-of-sale terminals hacked over the past year. The Target hack is thought to have cost banks and credit unions around $200 million, and the company's CEO stepped down in the aftermath, especially after reports found that warnings from analysts and even an alert from the security system itself had gone unheeded before the attack was discovered.",0.42027487437838407,0.5797251256216159,0.8506265379988805,298,4.9966442953020138,193,5.8497409326424874,0,0,"Business, US & World",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

In July, a bitcoin startup named Xapo announced it was raising $20 million, bringing its total backing to $40 million. It was using this funding for an unusually intense security setup. Xapo tells users that they can feel secure because their bitcoin will be stored in offline servers, scattered across multiple continents, in secret underground vaults, with armed guards, and biometric sensors. We sat down with Xapo CEO Wences Casares to discuss why he thinks such extreme measures are necessary and how he sees bitcoin changing the world. This interview has been edited and condensed What makes you so passionate about bitcoin? ""When I was growing up, I saw them lose everything, three times."" My parents were sheep ranchers in Patagonia, and when I was growing up, I saw them lose everything, three times. A lot of people in America don’t understand what it’s like when your family loses everything. And when it happened in Argentina, you see your parents have all this anxiety, it has consequences that are more than just economic, something happens to the whole society, it takes a long time to build back, to recover. There is only about 1.5 billion people who have a bank account the way you and I do, with a credit card and checkbook, so there are more than 5 billion people who don’t have that. Basically they don’t have the right to safekeep the fruits of their labor. They work very hard all day, they get $5 for that, and then they are forced to keep it in cash. I think that bitcoin is going to change the world more than the internet did, and I’m very conscious of what I’m saying. I know that it’s hard to imagine, but I truly think that it touches something that matters more to a huge percentage of the world. We don’t see the problem here in America. I think it will take longer to develop, but it will have a bigger impact, by giving the majority of people in the world the ability to affordably safekeep their money. How will bitcoin enable people to get bank accounts who couldn’t before? ""bitcoin is going to change the world more than the internet did."" Think of the cellphone. There were never more than 1.2 billion landlines. Then the cellphone came and we’re at 6.3 billion. Why? It’s not because only those people wanted to communicate. The landlines were all post-pay. You need to have credit to get one. The cell phones were pre-paid. Suddenly you could get one with cash. It had nothing to do with technology. It was an economic restriction. Now there are 1.5 billion bank accounts, same threshold as land lines. I think bitcoin will allow us to see 6.3 billion people banking on their cell phones. That’s what’s so exciting to me. That’s a much better world than we have today. So if bitcoin is so safe and affordable, why are you going to these crazy length with security? We take the private keys of those coins and put them in offline servers in underground vaults, with armed security, and biometric sensors, and all that stuff, because that was the only way we could get it insured. In fact, it’s worse than that. There are several servers, each one in a different continent, with different keys, and you would need to break into all of them, within 24 hours. ""It’s a little bit extreme, actually ridiculously extreme."" I wouldn’t keep my coins any other way. I know what the bad guys are doing. I wouldn’t keep them on my computer, or my phone. It takes building things. Unlike with banks, you have a piece of code that is worth money. For us to get the insurance, we wouldn’t get it if there was a high risk of a hack. If you’re not thorough with your security the insurance guys won’t touch you. It’s a little bit extreme, actually ridiculously extreme, but you do all this work up front so you can play this game for the long haul. But doesn’t it defeat the purpose of a fast, safe digital currency if you have to keep it in an offline bank vault? We designed it so that you can have the best of both worlds. You have two accounts that are coupled. If you are using bitcoin for payments, you keep some in your wallet, which can be accessed anytime. You can send and receive bitcoins in real time on the web, over email, text message, Twitter, Facebook, whatever. Whatever you want to insure you send to the vault. Because we don’t have to have that bitcoin readily available, it takes 24 hours, we can do things that would otherwise be impossible. It’s like a checking and savings account. Convenience and security. What is the state of bitcoin right now? There are 6 million people in the world who have used bitcoin, and only 300,000 of them have ever actually used it to pay for something. So most people are using it as a store of value. I believe that this is the perfect native internet currency. It has all the attributes to flow across the web and mobile just as bits flow, as information moves. And that can change the world, but not with only 6 million people. Maybe with six hundred million. ""It has all the attributes to flow across the web and mobile just as bits flow."" What would it take to get there? What’s happening right now with bitcoin is very much like what was happening with the internet in 1992. Before the browser, someone looks at TCP/IP and says, oh my God, this thing moves information from anywhere to anywhere real time and for free! It’s going to change information forever, so I’m going to launch Netflix. Well, hold on. Yes, but not now. Not for 20 years. First we need much better computers, more broadband, lots of things have to happen. Same thing with bitcoin. Yes, it will change everything, but not now, not yet. Email with 6 million people wasn’t email, it was a curiosity. It seems like a lot of big e-commerce sites are now accepting bitcoin. Aren’t people paying for goods with it right now? ""It’s a sideshow to distract the idiots.""A good currency has two main use cases, a store of value and a payment mechanism. Right now what we are seeing with bitcoin is most people using it just as a store of value. A lot of people like to write and talk about using bitcoin to buy things, but they confuse the way they would like things to be with the way the world really is right now. They are writing about this fantasy. I don’t see it happening with my users. I look at the blockchain and I don’t see it happening there. Even though there are some-big name merchants that accept it, show me anyone that is doing more than 1 percent of their transactions in BTC. It’s irrelevant, it’s just a press release. That’s not where the BTC action is happening. It’s a sideshow to distract the idiots. If you’re in the industry and you know what’s going on, it has nothing to do with that. So how will it happen? Trying to push payments now, trying to replace credit cards, I think would be a mistake. Like trying to push video in 1992. Dogecoin taught us a lot. The kind of things they were doing, five cents here, five centers there, are where bitcoin can thrive. No fighting to replace credit cards right now. Enable the flow of tips and small transactions around the internet, that is the more natural entry point. We play tic tac toe online: I put down 50 bits, you put 50 bits. I win and buy a song. You leave me a little tip on an article because you like my comment. It’s whatever, but it flows. ""What is truly remarkable is the story of zero to 6 million.""When people write the history of this thing, of bitcoin, they are not going to write the story of 6 million to a billion. What is truly remarkable is the story of zero to 6 million. It has already happened! And we’re not paying attention! That’s incredible. That’s what had one chance in a million and it already happened. Bitcoin, the community, we are going to add more than 1 million this month, we will be at 10 million by the end of the year, and if it keeps growing the way it has, it will be at more than a billion within five years. Each one of those people are infecting new people so that a few more join each month, and it’s then that payments start to happen organically.",0.46625545576843175,0.5337445442315683,0.19873997285813405,1482,4.52361673414305,609,5.7602627257799668,0,0,"Business, Tech, Report",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

Comcast has officially named the company formerly known as ""SpinCo,"" where it announced it would deposit 2.5 million Comcast customers earlier this year. The move is an attempt to placate regulators by ensuring Comcast won't own more than 30 percent of the TV service market, even after it folds in subscribers from TWC. The ""30 percent rule"" was struck down as official FCC policy in 2009, but Comcast has written before that it will adhere to it anyways as a show of good faith. If the merger goes through, a portion of Comcast networks across Alabama, Kentucky, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, Tennessee, and Wisconsin will be spun off under the GreatLand banner. According to previous statements, the company will be publicly traded, but it will be partially managed by Charter, currently the fourth-largest cable operator. Charter will hold a 33 percent stake, while 67 percent will be owned by Comcast shareholders (but not Comcast itself.) Its president and CEO, Michael Willner, is the former CEO of Insight Communications, a cable company that was bought by TWC in 2012. Board members will be selected by Charter and Comcast. Separately, Charter is also directly acquiring 1.4 million Time Warner Cable customers as part of the deal. The name of the company is a trivial thing, for all Willner's excitement that it ""pays homage to the rich history and striking geographies"" of the states it covers. But if the Comcast/TWC merger is approved, you'll want to get familiar with it, as it could be one of the biggest operators in the country. While Comcast's deal is predicated on preventing accusations that it has a cable monopoly, much of the merger controversy has focused on its internet service — it could capture over half the high-speed broadband market, though Comcast claims that it's also facing competition from DSL and mobile internet providers.

Now the company claims that Lyft drivers taking calls from SLOG recruiters saw their hourly earnings drop by as much as 48 percent, as a result of unusually short rides and a huge surge in cancelled pickups. Under Operation SLOG, Uber contractors booked rides with Lyft drivers with the sole purpose of striking up a conversation and signing them up to work for Uber. (Drivers can work for both companies simultaneously, although this is discouraged.) These contractors were offered commissions as high as $750 for recruiting a single driver. They used burner phones and credit cards, and occasionally canceled rides, in order to avoid detection by Lyft. Drivers in Orange County saw a 48 percent decline in hourly wages when Uber recruiters were on the job According to the new numbers, Uber recruiters were also costing local Lyft drivers a lot of money. Lyft points to drivers in Orange County, who usually earn $36.20 per hour, but only averaged $18.60 per hour during the hours that Uber recruiters were on the job. That's a 48 percent decline in total. Other areas saw smaller declines, with a 12 percent decline in San Francisco and a 24 percent decline for drivers working the Los Angeles International Airport. Lyft also claims recruiters canceled roughly 85 percent of the rides they called, a huge source for the lost wages. The practices could be grounds for a lawsuit, the high-profile tech attorney Ira Rothken told BuzzFeed. Lyft could argue that the Uber recruiters violated its terms of service, interfered with its existing contracts, or violated California's ""Unfair Competition Law.""

The FCC found that for several years during the mid-2000s, Verizon had not properly informed some customers about their ability to opt out from having their information used in helping it tailor marketing campaigns. Information about opting out of this data collection has traditionally been included on either the first bill or a welcome letter from Verizon, but about 2 million customers did not receive the notice, which is required by the Communications Act.  ""It is plainly unacceptable."" ""In today’s increasingly connected world, it is critical that every phone company honor its duty to inform customers of their privacy choices and then to respect those choices,"" Travis LeBlanc, acting chief of FCC’s Enforcement Bureau, says in a statement. ""It is plainly unacceptable for any phone company to use its customers’ personal information for thousands of marketing campaigns without even giving them the choice to opt out."" The long lapse in opt-out notices began in 2006 and continued for several years before being discovered in 2012. Verizon then failed to notify the FCC for another several months, when it should have reported the problem within five days. As part of the settlement, Verizon has agreed to several terms that are aimed at preventing this from happening in the future. For one, it's going to include opt-out notices on every bill for the next three years. Verizon will also set up a monitoring system to ensure that these notices are going out. As before, in the event that an error of any significance occurs, it'll be required to notify the FCC within five days. ""Verizon takes seriously its obligation to comply with all FCC rules,"" the company says in a statement, ""and once we discovered the issue with the notices we informed the FCC, fixed the problem, and implemented a number of measures to ensure it does not recur."" Verizon notes that the issue did not involve a data breach or information being disclosed to third parties — but only that opt-out notices were not provided to some consumers before they were sent marketing material about various Verizon services. Even if that doesn't sound dramatic, the FCC's response is still a strong sign that it won't tolerate lapses in consumer privacy. The $7.4 million figure alone — which is being paid to the Treasury — is said to be the largest sum in FCC history for a settlement related solely to the personal information of telephone customers.",0.41382982173875515,0.5861701782612448,0.8851099286698791,437,5.0343249427917618,247,5.9635627530364372,0,0,"Business, Policy & Law",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

The Cord app wants to change all that We’ve reached an odd point in the evolution of messaging. My wife and my aunt both have large Android phones, but can’t stand the virtual keyboards. They speak a message out loud which Google translates back into text. When I get these messages while I’m driving my car, I ask Siri to read me the text, and she gives it her best shot. We’ve gone through a completely unnecessary triple translation that wastes time and often garbles the meaning of the message. ""That has made voice messaging a dirty word."" At the same time I know many people who absolutely refuse to listen to voicemail. Entering a password and wading through an options menu to listen to scratchy audio is a miserable experience. So what do you do when you can’t just hop on the phone and chat in real time? Today two veterans of Google’s Creative Lab, Thomas Gayno and Jeff Baxter, are releasing a new app, Cord, that lets you send and receive brief audio messages up to 12 seconds long. ""People hate voicemail, and justifiably so"" says Baxter. ""By extension that has made voice messaging a dirty word. But it doesn’t have to be that way."" The Cord app is very simple, but surprisingly nuanced. You connect with friends through your contacts or by inputting their username. Tap on a buddy's face to listen to a message they've sent you. Tap and hold on a face to send a message of your own, like with photo-messaging app Taptalk. It automatically plays over the speaker, but lift the phone to your ear and it will play over the earpiece instead. I’ve been playing with the app this week and it works well. The interface is intuitive and I was able to quickly send and receive messages, even on a 3G network. ""In terms of data, these messages are much lighter than an Instagram image,"" says Gayno. Voice calls have been declining sharply since 2011 It’s ironic, but in the age where everyone has a phone on them at all times, we’re actually talking to each other a lot less. The amount of time we spent on voice calls rose with the advent of cellphones in the late 1990s, but that trend has reversed more recently, with voice calls falling sharply since 2011. Between 2009 and 2012, the number of teens who used their phones to talk everyday dropped more than 50 percent, and a recent British study found just 3 percent of millennials use voice calling for daily communications. Apple and Google will likely offer this standard There are plenty of other apps that already provide a voice option: Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, and Voxer, to name a few. You can hack your way to a voice-messaging app using the native recording app on Android or iOS, and the upcoming iOS 8 makes simple voice-messaging standard. The difference is that all these apps also let you send text, photos, and in some cases, video. ""We know Apple is baking voice into iMessage and no doubt it will be part of Google Hangouts,"" says Baxter. ""But it will always just be one choice among many, and that will make it hard for them to make a first-class voice experience of the caliber we are focused on building."" Cord just closed a a $1.8 million seed round of funding led by Metamorphic Ventures and Lerer Hippeau Ventures, with participation from Google Ventures, Greycroft, Dave Morin's Slow Ventures, and Gary Vaynerchuk. ""Messaging is a very noisy space right now, but we’re betting this team knows how to stand out,"" says David Hirsch, the managing partner at Metamorphic. Before starting Cord, Baxter, and Gayno spent five years leading teams at Google’s Creative Lab, where they worked on projects like Google Glass, Android, and Hangouts, an experience that inspired them to focus on a more emotional form of communication that could work across not just phones but all kinds of smart devices. ""We think it’s a good bet that in five years a lot of people will have a smart watch, or glasses, or car. Those are all devices where using your voice to communicate makes a lot more sense than a keyboard,"" says Gayno. There have been recent reports about a slew of new Android Wear devices in the works, and the Cord team is planning for the world. ""As you can imagine, having worked on Glass, and other still-unannounced projects at Google, we believe the next couple of quarters are going to be very rich in terms of new wearables,"" says Gayno. Planning for a future of connected devices without keyboards Still, why would I use a dedicated voice-messaging app when the ability to send and receive audio is likely to be a native feature of these next-gen gadgets? ""One of our most obvious advantages is that we are not Apple or Google, therefore we are building for a seamless experience across any platform, and we can be faster to get on any device that matters."" says Baxter. ""If you have an iPhone and an Android watch and maybe a smart-car system with an entirely different operating system, we want Cord to be the layer that connects them all and makes it easy to sync your contacts and messages across devices."" The app is currently on iOS only, but the founders says Android is coming soon. Cord taps into another big trend in messaging, ephemerality. ""We got rid of threaded messages, because it doesn’t really make sense to display audio that way,"" says Baxter. Your messages are stored as a list of the 100 most recent messages, and after that, ""They fade off your phone unless you mark them as favorites to keep. So that makes it kind of naturally ephemeral, and not in a gimmicky, but in a functional way."" ""Our phones got so smart, we forgot they were phones in the first place."" The best part of using Cord for a week was how shockingly good the audio quality was compared to the native voicemail and phone calls. ""People who have been testing the app asked us what we did to get the sound in HD, but we haven’t done anything,"" says Gayno. ""These devices have amazing microphones. But the whole voice experience has been really neglected and depends so much on the carrier infrastructure, and they are compressing that voice audio to a really low level. That’s part of the whole problem we’re attacking here. Our phones got so smart, we forgot they were phones in the first place.""",0.6682500930883836,0.33174990691161643,0.1715049380451097,1108,4.6633574007220213,540,5.8518518518518521,0,0,"Apps, Business, Tech, Report",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

Founded by a precocious teenager way back in 1997, the tech news site has grown from covering motherboards and other PC components to offering some of the most in-depth technical analyses of mobile devices today. Widely respected for his enormous experience and expertise, the site's founder and editor Anand Lal Shimpi revealed over the weekend that he was retiring from technology journalism, and now his next destination has been revealed: Apple Inc. An Apple representative has confirmed the hire for Recode, though there's predictably little information to go on beyond the fact that one of tech journalism's most authoritative figures has joined one of the industry's true giants. Shimpi has previously done consulting work and collaborated with hardware manufacturers on identifying and rectifying issues with components like solid state drives. He was also the driving force behind AnandTech's push to name and shame smartphone manufacturers that artificially enhanced their devices' performance in popular benchmarks. Now at Apple, he's most likely to remain focused on the intricacies of device engineering, though his deep industry connections may also help enhance the company's already extraordinary supply chain. Shimpi's departure note on AnandTech states that the site's editorial staff has been expanded over the course of this year to prepare for his absence. Also missing from AnandTech's archives since February is Brian Klug, the site's senior smartphone reviewer, who 9to5Mac reports is already working at Apple. Given the close working relationship between Klug and Shimpi, it makes sense that the two would seek to continue their partnership.

Today, the White House announced that it was releasing a draft based on the principles of the Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights, which was first released in 2012. Consumer privacy is one of several internet-related issues that Obama promised to address in his State of the Union address, and he previously released a fact sheet outlining both this and other proposed changes. The Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights Act of 2015 would address the large amounts of data that companies can collect from customers — whether it's used internally, analyzed by advertisers, or sold to a third-party aggregator. It would require companies to provide ""concise and easily understandable"" explanations of how data will be used, as well as options for customers to see, correct, or remove information. Companies have to create ""easily understandable"" data use policies Specifically, this covers information like names, addresses, social security or passport numbers, fingerprints, or credit card numbers; it does not cover ""de-anonymized"" data that theoretically couldn't be traced back to a specific person, or information involved in identifying a cybersecurity problem, as long as companies make ""reasonable efforts"" to remove identifying information. Companies have to make clear what information is collected, who it will be shared with, when and if it will be destroyed, how it's kept secure, and how customers can see or remove it. Companies are also required to take ""reasonable steps"" to mitigate privacy risks and make them clear to users, and the FTC will need to establish rules for privacy reviews. If a company violates the terms of the act, it's subject to lawsuits from the FTC, users, and state attorneys general. The bill creates exemptions for small operators, including people who process data for 10,000 or fewer people a year or have no more than five employees, which the White House says can ease the burden for small businesses. It's already sometimes possible to find out what information companies have collected. California's ""Shine the Light"" law, for example, requires companies to reveal what information they've sold to third-party marketing companies. Companies like Facebook have also attempted to make their privacy policies more readable in light of the tremendous amount of information it holds. The bill assumes ""a world where all of our data is collected about us, all of the time."" Alvaro Bedoya, director of the Center on Privacy and Technology at Georgetown's law school, worries that Obama's bill could actually preempt state laws, in favor of letting companies collect what they want as long as they maintained some level of transparency. He cites rules in Illinois and Texas that ban companies from collecting biometric information without permission. ""This bill would erase those protections without offering any clear replacement,"" he writes, adding that it ""seems to assume a world where all of our data is collected about us, all of the time."" He's not alone. Nonprofit Consumer Watchdog calls the bill ""full of loopholes"" and said it ""envisions a process where industry will dominate in developing codes of conduct."" The Center for Digital Democracy says it relies too much on companies' judgment to decide whether information is sensitive and how it should be managed, limiting the FTC's power. ""Although the president's Privacy Bill of Rights promised transparency and control, it creates a labyrinth-like process that consumers must navigate before they can actually access and correct their own data records held by companies,"" says a statement. And the Center for Democracy and Technology says it ""falls short on the privacy protections needed in today's digital world."" Ultimately, Bedoya hopes whatever reaches Congress will be more specific and authoritative, opening the door to meaningful reform. Obama, meanwhile, will continue pushing on other fronts — earlier this month, he introduced a cybersecurity executive order, one more in a long and dubious series of attempts to create rules governing breaches like last year's Sony hack.

Titled ""Make this the year YOU discover a new destination,' the video follows Banksy — or a man presumed to be Banksy — as he enters the Strip and paints a series of images on the rubble inside.  It's a very dark satire  The video begins with ""Banksy"" entering Gaza via a ""network of illegal tunnels"" (the caption says it's ""well away from the tourist track""). It juxtaposes images of Palestinian children playing with images of armed Israeli soldiers, and pans slowly over the destruction in Gaza before moving to a shot of the artist at work.

This season has been a trainwreck, giving viewers every reason not to watch the smoldering caboose sputter into the station of these final episodes. Hell, I have enumerated many of those reasons. The program has a regressive perspective of female empowerment, first giving a group of men the right to vote on who would be this season’s bachelorette, and later giddily shaming a woman’s sexuality to boost ratings. But, and this is a but that undermines much of that, the star of this season, Kaitlyn Bristowe, is a revelation. She’s brash. She’s funny. She’s the most real person to have ever appeared at the center of a reality television show. I’m not the first to notice Bristowe’s uncanny ability to be a normal human, which is to say someone as flawed and fickle as they are charming, funny, and thoughtful. Through better and worse, she has flouted the rigid expectations that come with dating a couple dozen men on broadcast television, and instead experienced a month-long world-wide trip with so many suitors as one should: with abandon. Tonight, the show will give Bristowe the time it allots each season for her to sleep with a predetermined number of contestants. But the bachelorette has already spent ""private time"" with one of the men, an act the show presents as a travesty, and any adult who has dated sees as perfectly benign. Right now a woman is dismantling the hypocritical fairytale exterior of reality TV’s biggest dating show, and you would be remiss to skip it. Even if, like my friend Emily, you have somehow resisted this season till now.      Emily Yoshida: It happened sometime in the hours after Chris Soules bestowed the final rose upon his (now ex-) fiancée Whitney Bischoff. We — by we I mean Bachelor Nation, whose 2016 presidential ticket would obviously be Chris Harrison b/w Michelle Money — had finally reached the end of another dramatic, shocking season, a season yours truly may have at one point described as ""sublime."" And as Harrison got ready to unveil the next bachelorette(s) to a rabid studio audience, I had something like a moment of clarity: I was done with this franchise. From the outside, it may have seemed like I was quitting just at the peak of the Bachelor fan experience — a truly weird Bachelor season that was leaps and bounds ahead of its predecessors as far as production and storytelling, a gimmicky double-Bachelorette season on the way. But my estimation of the just-finished season fell precipitously the moment Chris Harrison confirmed for us what a wild, dramatic, and unprecedented season it had been in Bachelor History. He does that every season, and it’s always a callback to the premiere episode, in which he promises a wild, dramatic, and unprecedented season in Bachelor History. Chris Soules’ season had felt in constant danger of flying out of The Bachelor’s already tenuous orbit of sanity, and for that reason, this time the crash back down to reality was all the more sobering. No matter how it perfects its formula, The Bachelor is the donut of reality shows: the fun is in the anticipation and the moment when you’re actually biting into it. But its regret margin is infinitesimal, and it takes almost no time once the digestion process has started to feel as if you’ve wasted your time (unlike, say, the noble Oreo, which continues to feel rewarding long after you’ve eaten too many). As a recent recovered resident of Bachelor Nation, I’m here to tell you, Chris, that The Bachelorette is not going to give you an unconventional dismantling of the very social structures that keep it in operation, and if it does, it will 100 percent be on its own terms. When you think you’re watching Weird Bachelor or Anti Bachelorette you’ll still be trapped in its sticky, network-approved web. It’ll make you feel free, but when that first Bachelor In Paradise promo goes up and you feel your serotonin begin to spike, how free are you, really?      Plante: You’re right — if The Bachelorette is to be dismantled from within, it will only be because its producers have calculated such a thing will attract the highest number of potential viewers and a plump ad rate to match. And you’re also correct that the anticipation and hype that the show conjures is more often better than the show itself. But let’s be real: a claim like ""The Bachelor is the donut of reality shows"" is bigger than both the donut and The Bachelor franchise. Pop culture has been and always will be junk food, and to enjoy with nominal regret requires a willingness to find the good within all the bad. If we want to talk about a hard crash back to reality, let’s recall the despondent viewers of Age of Ultron, shuffling from the theaters this summer, trying to convince themselves what they saw warranted a year-long hype-cycle. Unlike Age of Ultron, and so much pop culture, what brings me back to The Bachelor franchise is its occasional, but sincere glimpses into the lives of real people trying to make sense of the weird world of love we live in. Does The Bachelorette bear any resemblance to dating in real life? Of course not. But dating in real life today is unlike dating any time before it. We have the luxury of choice at a scale that surpasses this show. We have apps dedicated not just to dating, but the various purposes dating serves. We have countless methods to stay in contact, and countless ways within each method to fuck things up. And thanks to social media, our romantic lives have a constant, hungry audience.  The Bachelorette is the closest mainstream culture has to a shared therapy session about our modern love angsts. I have a feeling more people can relate to this breakup between Brooks and Desiree than, well, any break-up on any sitcom of the last decade. But perhaps more importantly, The Bachelorette is a safe option for us to publicly gab about the relationships of people we don’t know the way we privately gab about the people we do know. It’s also a prompt for conversations about social norms. The slut shaming of Kaitlyn Bristowe on ABC has been horrid, but it’s inspired countless op-eds about a woman’s right to her own sexuality, and surely inspired some healthy conversations in American living rooms. And so I concede that yeah the show is sort of awful… awfully good at making us talk about our deepest fears and anxieties, that is! I’ll see myself out.      Yoshida: The best moment of each season of The Bachelor/ette is when the disgraced runner-up comes back for the reunion show to sit in the hot seat opposite Chris Harrison. Any normal human, when asked about the experience of being broken up with on television, would probably not have very good feedback, but the reject is always groomed and glowing, emphatic that they still believe in love / the power of television, and are ready to be the newest bachelor/ette. It’s so much of our modern experience in a nutshell: a fundamental belief in the goodness of the world that’s become so entwined with mercenary narcissism as to make the two halves indistinguishable. But it’s also a direct mirror of our experience as viewers: we’ve been disgraced by the end of the show (as well done as the show can be, a dull final third is basically a fact of each season by now which we keep bullishly plowing through) but we try to spin it as a learning experience, if only to explain where those 26 hours of our lives went. Don’t get me wrong, there’s lots that we can learn via Kaitlyn and The Bachelor — not everything, but a large percentage of what I know, I learned from The Bachelor. But at this point I feel like I’m ready to graduate and learn about something else.

Groove will support the ability to upload music to Microsoft's OneDrive cloud storage service and access the songs for free from Windows devices, Xbox consoles, and Android or iPhone handsets.

If the Bat’s life goal was just having a body count of zero, then he was doing something that the vast majority of people managed without even trying. It was like patting yourself on the back for not finishing a marathon. No, the real value was in being the kind of man who must constantly and heroically fight to avoid painting the city with an enemy’s blood. Really, though, most of Gotham thought he shouldn't worry. If Harvey Dent ran someone over at 60 miles per hour? They were henchman foie gras. If Cobblepot planted explosive gel on someone's feet, they'd explode. If the Joker tackled a man covered in third-degree burns, pulled him right out of the air, and punched him in the face half a dozen times... well, who knew what happened with anything around the Joker, these days. But the odds of survival were infinitely smaller. If Cobblepot planted explosive gel on someone's feet, they'd explode It had taken a few years, and a lot of broken bones, but Batman's improbable non-lethality slowly drifted from sarcastic theory to accepted law. And walking back to his basement apartment from what turned out to be a nearly fatal cat burglary — rain and high windows proving a losing combination — this member of Gotham’s criminal element made a crucial connection: being Batman’s enemy was the safest job around. The man ran through his past few years of life in Gotham. Law enforcement was a death sentence, obviously. So was any civil service job, really. The private sector had to live with being driven out and looted during the inevitable evacuation every few years (although landlords had gotten reasonable eminent domain settlements when half the city was briefly converted into a maximum-security prison.) Petty criminals feared invading the kingpins’ turf. But if you put yourself directly in the way of Gotham’s apex predator, the worst that could happen was a hospital stay. Turning half the city into a prison had probably been an eminent domain nightmare Why else did so many criminal enterprises run their operations out of Gotham — a gentrified city with a dogged police commissioner where trade was regularly disrupted? How did they hire dozens of underlings to carry out schemes with no conceivable profit motive? Why did they ally with each other so easily and so often? It suddenly seemed so obvious. Batman was an insurance policy. As long as he could theoretically put you away, the police wouldn’t bother you. As long as you were wearing an official Batman nemesis ridiculous henchman costume, outsiders wouldn’t bother you. The Armed Freelancer’s Guild dues didn’t even seem so exorbitant any more. While the mooks were holding up banks or taking reporters hostage, the boss could be running multi-level marketing scams or embezzling from shell company clients or any other scheme that couldn’t be foiled by patrolling the city and punching. Or running drugs. Batman only seemed to touch weird designer fear serums or madness-inducing human growth hormone or anything else that no one in their right mind would ever sell for profit. The problem, the criminal thought, was that some part of Batman seemed to realize what was going on. Every time the guy came out, it was with some kind of terrifying new weapon that stopped just a hair short of lethal. The blasting gel and stun guns had been bad enough, but a tank? A sniper rifle? A car that could cut through cement? It was like just stopping criminals wasn’t enough. He had to know he was balancing his morality on a knife’s edge, that every fight put his single guiding principle in greater and greater jeopardy. The act of almost killing had become Batman’s extreme sport, and he was pushing it to the edge. What happened if he snapped? They’d all have to find another city, the men in bright colors and animal costumes and expensive jet suits and hypodermic gloves. They would drop their flashy handles and cover their disfiguring injuries. They would behave like any other criminals, fighting the courts and the police and the cartels. Cartels? God, they sounded terrifying. No, they had to keep him here. To be just inept enough that he never felt truly cornered. And just as the Dark Knight couldn’t kill them, they couldn’t kill the Dark Knight. The act of almost killing had become Batman's extreme sport For now, though, it was perfect. He would start tomorrow. He probably couldn’t make the Arkham Knight’s militia, but Penguin seemed feasible. At least he wouldn’t have to wear that weird clown makeup. And Scarecrow was a hepatitis infection vector waiting to happen. And the al-Ghul guy only hired people who’d been playing with katanas since they were six, and — The would-be criminal didn’t even have time to turn as the Batmobile careened through the wall beside him. It hit him square in the back like a sleek black freight train, its grill crackling with electricity. He flew ten feet in the air and landed in a pile of crumbling bricks and drywall. Legs crushed, head swimming, but improbably — miraculously — alive. Yes, he thought through a haze of pain. He had been initiated. His future was set. The car was long gone, taking part of a freeway overpass with it. ""It’s the… freakin’ Bat,"" he mumbled anyways, just for practice.

Image credit: Droid Life Every year around this time, Samsung introduces a new version of the Galaxy Note, the stylus-toting phablet that made phablets a thing. This year, it's about to make the Note far nicer. The Note 5 should be a much nicer looking Note Leaks have pointed to the Note 5 getting a major design overhaul that'll bring it in line with the Galaxy S6. That means the Note 5 should have a sleek body made of metal and glass, rather than a mix of plastic and fake leather, like in recent versions. The Note 5 is otherwise staying true to the line's standbys. It's supposed to stick with a 5.7-inch Quad HD display and come with a stylus that pops out of its bottom. The phone is supposed to keep the same 16MP camera resolution in back and move up to a 5MP camera in the front. It's expected to include an Octa-core processor, 4GB of RAM, and a 3,000mAh battery. Notably, the metal body means that this model likely won't accept microSD cards for expanded storage or include a removable battery. Those are downsides, but they should be more than balanced out by the improved build.   This phone is basically what it sounds like: a larger version of the S6 Edge. As the leaked photo above shows, it's essentially Samsung's answer to the iPhone 6 Plus, serving as an alternative for people who like the size of the Note but don't want its stylus features. Just imagine a giant S6 Edge In fact, the S6 Edge Plus is supposed to be a lot like the Note 5. It'll have a 5.7-inch Quad HD display, with the obvious bonus of its screen wrapping slightly around its sides. It's supposed to have pretty much all of the same specs, too. That's not too surprising: both of these phones largely appear to be using what's already in the S6 and S6 Edge. So why choose one over the other? That's something Samsung will have to explain, but chances are we'll see more features designed to take advantage of the Note's stylus and the S6 Edge's edges. We'll likely be playing with both phones pretty soon, too — Apple has its own announcements coming up, and it seems like Samsung is trying to get a word (well, two phones) in first.

We've already seen it produce a highly realistic new method for animating clothes, and now a couple of other fascinating projects have been revealed, both of which draw us deeper into the uncanny valley of human simulation. The first among them is Dyna, which is a system for modeling human soft-tissue deformations caused by motion. Basically, it adds real-world jiggling to the traditionally solid-as-a-rock 3D models of CGI. Researchers from the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems performed 40,000 scans on 10 subjects with varying body shapes and sizes. The ingenuity of their system is that it can be generalized beyond the particular subjects they used to develop their model. This means, for example, that you can use the data from an overweight large man to add realistic soft-tissue motion to a big and burly troll. Watch the video above for more examples of this adaptability and all the creative ways in which jiggling can be exaggerated or minimized.  No less impressive is the skin stretch demo produced by a collaboration between the University of Southern California and Imperial College London. It's also concerned with simulating deformations, but focuses on the skin of the face and the microscopic changes in its texture and appearance as it's either stretched or compressed. Digital faces are looking more human than ever As with the Dyna model, the USC animation system begins with lots of highly detailed observations of real-world subjects. The researchers performed scans of various patches of skin at a 10-micron (one-hundredth of a millimeter) resolution, collecting precise information about the appearance of skin while it's stretched, relaxed, or contracted. Skin stretching was measured using a caliper and a custom 3D-printed stretching aperture. All of that data was then combined to produce a pleasingly simple solution to enhancing realism: a displacement map, which determines the roughness of the rendered skin, is blurred when the skin is stretched and sharpened when the skin is compressed. The researchers admit that their method doesn't emulate the full spectrum of morphological changes in skin as it's manipulated, but they certainly do a fine job of recreating the small, almost imperceptible variations. The best thing about their approach, though, is that it can be deployed in real-time with conventional graphics cards.

X-rays allowed researchers from the Institute for Microelectronics and Microsystems in Naples, Italy to discover slight contrast between the paper and the ink. about 300 scrolls are still intact The villa where the scrolls were found was in Herculaneum, one of two towns destroyed. Herculaneum was barraged by very hot gas and ashes, while the other town, Pompeii, was buried in lava. The gasses in Herculaneum didn't burn the scrolls — but they did make the scrolls exceptionally fragile. The scrolls were carbonized in the blast, and though attempts have been made to unroll them since their initial excavation in 1752, those attempts have mostly been destructive. Eventually, scholars gave up. The scrolls — about 300 are still intact, and there are also many fragments — probably belonged to the family of the father-in-law of Julius Caesar.

That may make genetically modified organisms safer for use outside the lab. Some people worry that GMOs might spread widely beyond their intended use, damaging the environment. Today, two groups of scientists announced they've created modified E. coli strains that requires lab-made food in order to survive — so if any of these altered E. coli make it to the wild, they're toast. GMOs can evolve ways to shut down ""kill switches"" Other kinds of containment exist for GMOs. One strategy is to disable their ability to make certain kinds of essential nutrients — but this strategy isn't foolproof, since it may be possible to scavenge that substance from the environment. And over several generations, organisms may evolve a new way to create the nutrient. Another way to contain GMOs is to create a ""kill switch"" — making bacteria vulnerable to a toxin. But again, the evolutionary process could provide a way for these creates to shut down their kill switches. Today's findings may provide a new path to contain any possible escapees, one that isn't vulnerable to evolutionary pressures. ""We’re standing at the cusp of the biotech century and the first thing we need to do is develop robust safety measures,"" said Farren Isaacs, a biologist at the Yale School of Medicine, and the lead researcher on one of the studies, in a telephone interview. In the future, GMOS could be used to clean up oil spills and improve food production Genetically-modified bacteria are already in use to produce drugs, high-value chemicals, and milk and dairy products, said George Church, a geneticist at Harvard Medical School, and the lead researcher on the other study, in a press conference. Concerns about how these human-modified bacteria might affect the environment has limited their use. Today's new safety stopgaps might allow for more widespread applications, like cleaning up oil spills and improving food production. Isaacs says that his and Church’s research ""establishes a foundation to more broadly develop these types of technology in other organisms."" Of course, that’s still years away. Isaacs and Church led research published in 2013 that radically redesigned E. coli bacteria; the two are frequent collaborators, although their work on today's papers was separate. Now, Church and Isaacs have expanded upon this research in a pair of studies.  Genetically modified organisms could be used to further improve agricultural methods. The new strains of E. coli are dependent on artificial food Church and colleagues’ paper today updates their redesign, making the modified E. coli’s metabolism dependent on a lab-created amino acid in several places across the genome. Amino acids are the compounds that make up proteins, which perform a variety of essential tasks in living things. Without the artificial amino acid, the E. coli can't translate their RNA into functioning proteins. In order to acquire the amino acid, the bacteria require lab-prepared nutrients. The scientists used computational design to determine how to make the E. coli dependent on artificial amino acids. In so doing, they redesigned three proteins E. coli requires to live, and created two new E. coli strains dependent on artificial food. Isaacs' group also used the 2013 strain of E. coli and engineered it to be dependent on an artificial amino acid. But Isaacs and his collaborators a different method: their target was essential genes. Their group made sure that the genes couldn’t code for proteins without the artificial amino acids — meaning, again, that the E. coli couldn’t function without its lab-made meal. ""This means you can restrict the growth [of these organisms] to localized environments. It really solves a long-standing problem in biotechnology,"" Isaacs told The Verge. Modifying plants in the same way is ""more of a challenge, but not out of reach."" The increased safety isn't the only reason these bacteria are attractive. They're also more resistant to viral infections, Church said in the press conference. Though plant and animal cells haven't been modified in this way, that's a future direction for his research. Plants usually have about nine times as many protein-coding genes as E. coli — and those are the genes that matter for the technique, also introduce new time constraints as researchers were forced to wait longer for samples to grow and mature. ""They are definitely more of a challenge, but not out of reach,"" Church said at the press conference. However, some scientists are skeptical that Church and Isaacs’ methods could be so easily transplanted into complex organisms. The more genes an organism has, the greater the chances of unforeseen consequences, says Professor Alison Smith of the University of Cambridge’s Department of Plant Sciences. ""The work that [Church and Isaacs] have done is very elegant, but the spin they’ve put on it that it will 'solve' GM — meaning GM plants and possible GM animals as well — is an overstatement,"" Smith says.

These displays were caught on cameras mounted on top of three 6-feet-long squid by a group researchers at Stanford University and at the National Geographic Society. According to the scientists, the squid might be using the flashing to communicate with others, whereas the flickering might be used as camouflage. ""Nobody had ever attached cameras onto free-swimming squid before."" ""This is pretty much the first study of its kind,"" says Hannah Rosen, a squid researcher at Stanford University and a co-author of the study. ""Nobody had ever attached cameras onto free-swimming squid before."" Researchers already knew that this behavior was possible, but ""anytime this was observed it was kind of under high stress situations,"" Rosen says. It's hard to see the Humboldt squid in their natural environment, since the species tends to hang out deep in the water column during the day; they only come up at night. So until now, the scientists weren't sure why the color displays happened. But by filming the squid using natural light and cameras for the first time, scientists saw the behavior in context. Two squid were filmed during the day, and one was filmed at night. Rosen only got to see the videotapes, but she still thinks that ""seeing them perform in the natural environment during the day is pretty unique.""   Humboldt squid, flickering. (Stanford University / National Geographic Society) The squid's skin color changes over the course of their displays, and the resulting patters also change in a predictable way. The flickering behavior resembles what happens when light reflects at the bottom of a pool, Rosen says. This is why the scientists think the behavior serves as camouflage — it might serve to trick its prey into thinking that the squid isn't anything worth fleeing from. The flashing, on the other hand, tends to happen more often when other squid are around (pictured above). This hints that it might serve as a communication tool. We already know how squid produce these patterns: they contract their chromatophores — pigment-containing cells located on the skin that connect to nerves in the animals' central nervous system. The flashing and flickering is activated by these nerves in much of the same way that human brain sends signals to the hand to make it move, Rosen says. ""All squid species have these chromatophores,"" she says. ""But maybe give your calamari more respect next time you're enjoying it."" This study wasn't just about analyzing video clips. The devices that were mounted on the squid also recorded the squid's acceleration, the water's temperature, and depth data. The researchers hope that these data will help them find out more about the Humboldt squid's behavior in general. This is important because Humboldt squid are a commercially and ecologically important species, Rosen says. ""They are one of the most fished species in the world,"" she says. Learning more about them is therefore ""beneficial to the fisherman trying to catch them."" Rosen says that squids are a lot more complicated than some people think. ""It's easy to look at an invertebrate and say: ‘it doesn't have any bones,' ‘it looks bizarre,' or 'it's just a snail,'"" she says. But cephalopods — squids, octopuses, and cuttlefish, for instance — are thought to be a lot more intelligent that the lowly snail. ""So I wouldn't discourage people from eating,"" she says, ""But maybe give your calamari more respect next time you're enjoying it.""",0.6024110320997431,0.3975889679002569,0.41389086345152254,608,5.1003289473684212,318,6.10062893081761,0,2,"Science, Report, Watch This",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Greenpeace apologized for the stunt after the Peruvian authorities called them out for damaging the area around 1,500-year-old hummingbird carving back in December.

""Lawyers representing Greenpeace are driving from Lima to Nazca now to deliver our report to the Peruvian prosecutor,"" Mike Townsley, the chief spokesperson for Greenpeace International, told Bloomberg Businessweek.

Peru forbids anyone from walking on the Nazca Lines, including top officials and presidents (it has made a few exceptions in the past, however; those exceptions involved special footwear). As a result, people who wish to see the site's most famous carving — a 1,500-year-old hummingbird — must fly over it. ""You walk there and the footprint is going to last hundreds or thousands of years,"" Luis Jaime Castillo, a Peruvian deputy culture minister told the BBC right after the incident. The banner read more like an ad for Greenpeace than a call for change The damage caused by the activists was met with international outrage and a ton of bad press. The Greenpeace banner, which read ""Time for Change! The future is renewable. Greenpeace,"" was supposed to send a message to UN climate talk delegates, but it read more like an ad for Greenpeace itself than a call for change in environmental policies. Greenpeace named Wolfgang Sadik, a veteran Greenpeace Germany campaigner, as the mastermind behind the assault on the Nazca Lines. The organization has also named Martin Kaiser, the person responsible for Greenpeace's actions at the UN climate talk in Lima, and Isis Wiedeman, Greenpeace's chief communications officer at the Lima summit. Both are linked to Greenpeace Germany. Mauro Fernandez, the final activist named in the report and a staffer for Greenpeace's Argentina branch, told Peruvian reporters on Sunday night that Sadik hadn't informed him that the Nazca site was sensitive, and that their planned actions were illegal.

About 20 other activists took part in vandalizing the site, but they have not yet been named. ""The decisions were taken by those responsible while they were in Peru."" The backlash following Greenpeace's actions appears to have spurred the organization's cooperation. Their willingness to turn over the names may also be related to fact that members of Greenpeace advised Sadik and his team against placing the banner at the site. ""The decisions were taken by those responsible while they were in Peru,"" chief Greenpeace spokesperson Townsley said. ""At that point, there was no recourse back to Greenpeace International in Amsterdam or Greenpeace Germany in Hamburg."" A video showing a Japanese television crew entering the Nazca site in March 2013 was released earlier this month.

The government also plans to press criminal charges against the Greenpeace activists who vandalized the site.

Remembering details of past experiences — details like what you had for lunch last Friday, or what you learned in history class — is often an exercise in futility. But then sometimes, for what appears to be no reason at all, you remember every detail of an exceedingly mundane event. Now, researchers think they might have figured out why that is. As it turns out, emotional events, like those that trigger a fear response, can enhance a person's memory of related pieces of information acquired prior to the emotional moment. The finding, published today in Nature, is important because it means that memories can be selectively enhanced retroactively. And being able to do that, the researchers say, is pretty huge because it could lead to the development of training regimens that help people learn more efficiently, or that help people in the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease enhance past memories of their loved ones. An emotional event ""can have a very specific enhancing effect"" To study the effect that an emotional event can have on a previously acquired memory, researchers asked 30 adults to look at 60 images of various animals and tools, at random. The participants didn’t know anything about the experiment other than that they needed to look at these images, says Lila Davachi, a memory researcher at New York University and a co-author of the study. Approximately 10 minutes later, the participants were shown different images of animals and tools. During this phase of the experiment, they also received mild electrical shocks that were tied to either the tools or the animals. A person who received shocks when looking at animals, for instance, didn't receive a shock when looking at tools, and vice versa. The study was designed this way to ensure that the participants would experience emotional learning. In this case, the shock image category triggered an anticipatory fear response, as measured by the amount of sweat on the participants' skin. This other image category didn't. Once the shock phase was over, the participants were asked to spend time looking at a final set of 60 images of tools and animals. Like the first phase of the experiment, no shock were involved for either category. A day later, the researchers tested the participants to see how well they remembered the animals and the tools in all three phases of the experiment.  The memory change happens retroactively. To the researchers surprise, the participants who were shocked when they saw animals in phase 2 remembered the animals from the first phase — a phase that didn’t include shocks — far better than they remembered the tools in the first phase (the same can be said for people who were shocked when looking at tools). ""At the time that you were encountering those animals,"" Davachi says, ""you didn’t know that they were going to be important later on."" So, nothing could have occurred in phase 1 to change the memory, she says. The change therefore happened retroactively. This finding, Davachi says, is completely new. Scientists were aware that emotional events could enhance past memories, but they didn’t know that the enhancement could be so selective. This enhancement also occurred with the images in the third phase, but this was less surprising given that the emotional event had already taken place. ""This might be a way to build a really smart person."" ""This might be a way to build a really smart person,"" Davachi says. If scientists can find out more about this works, it might one day be possible to use this phenomenon to create a training regimen that could take advantage of the selective nature of memory. The finding might also be applicable to people with early stage Alzheimer’s disease, she says, because doctors might be able to strengthen past memories relating to loved ones by using images of their faces, and a stimulus of some kind. Of course, using electrical shocks, even mild ones, isn't ideal. Davachi therefore hopes to find out if other stimuli could have the same effect.  ""We only did shock here, so we don’t know the what extent [the effect] will generalize to positive learning systems, like rewards,"" she says. Still, Davachi thinks other forms of learning are likely to work as well.   Julian / Flickr ""It’s a great study. Wonderful!"" says Richard Morris, a neuroscientist at the University of Edinburgh who didn’t participate in the experiment. This work, he says, reveals that information that’s encoded incidentally during the day — information that might ordinarily be forgotten — can be remembered for much longer if related emotional learning takes place later in the day. ""This work adds a neat conceptual twist to the idea that [emotion] enhances incidental memory: there is an element of selectivity about what gets enhanced."" Daniel Schacter, a memory researcher at Harvard University who also didn't participate in the study, agrees that the experiment is solid. ""This study is important because it shows that an emotionally arousing experience can have a very specific enhancing effect on a previous related experience,"" he says. ""It’s a great study. Wonderful!"" The scientists don’t know what's going on in the brain to cause the memory enhancement. Davachi hypothesizes that there might be only moderate activity in the brain during phase 1 — the kind of activity that wouldn’t support long-term memory formation. But when phase 2 comes around, participants might experience a strong activation in the same areas of the brain that were activated in phase 1. That activation might then retroactively enhance the connections that were made in the brain before the shocks took place. But this is just an idea, she says. It’s also important to note that the enhancement didn’t happen right away. When the researchers tested the participants immediately after the three phases, the memory enhancement wasn’t apparent. ""It takes six hours"" for the enhancement to occur, she says. The researchers didn’t test the participants to see if the effect persisted beyond the 24-hour period after the experiment, but they hope to do so soon. ""We kind of rushed to get this out because it was really novel and exciting,"" she says. Davachi and her team also want to find out if it’s possible to enhance memories that were acquired 24 hours prior to phase 2, or even a week prior to phase 2. ""If phase 1 had occurred 24 hours before, or a week before, and you had already had a chance to consolidate these memories,"" she says, ""could you still enhance them?""  If the traumatic event is an assault, what aspect of the attacker gets selectively enhanced? There’s also the issue of similarity. In this experiment, scientists used images of tools and animals, but what if the emotional event is one relating to an assault perpetrated by a light-haired man? Would past memories relating specifically to light-haired men be selectively enhanced? Or would memories relating to all men be enhanced? ""You’re attaching meaning to this individual encounter, and it’s really important that you do so,"" Davachi says. But under those traumatic circumstances, it not might be beneficial to ""change your memories of past encounters with other related people."" Before they perform any of these follow-up experiments, the researchers want to use brain imaging to find out what’s really going on. Davachi thinks the study is important because it might help researchers understand why humans remember mundane details about their everyday lives. ""This is a little clue that [those memories are there] to help us bring back representations that you just don’t know in the moment will be important,"" she says. ""I have been studying memory for much longer than I would like to admit… and to me, this is super exciting.""",0.6258174018291249,0.37418259817087507,0.30660489042610234,1305,5.0390804597701147,533,6.1088180112570356,0,2,Science,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

A team at the University of Utah has discovered that two species of cone snail have a seemingly unique way to hunt — by releasing fish insulin into the water to slow down the metabolism of the fish they seek to eat. According to a study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the two fish-hunting cone snails that have evolved this unique ability are Conus geographus and Conus tulipa. These snails use a specially evolved fish insulin to induce hypoglycemic shock in their prey. Instead of pursuing their meals, they wait until one swims by and then flood the surrounding waters with the insulin. That causes a suppression of glucose to the fish's vital organs (like the brain), rendering the snails' targets lethargic and easy to catch. ""We already knew that these animals make hundreds of neurotoxins in their venom and compounds that cause tissue degradation and affect cardiovascular function,"" says Helena Safavi, a researcher at the University of Utah and co-author of the study. ""Now we can add yet another mechanism to this list: the disruption of the prey’s energy metabolism."" Researchers at the University of Utah were using DNA and protein sequencing to examine the components of snail venom, in the hopes that it might have pharmaceutical potential. While doing that, it was discovered that one compound wasn't a neurotoxin at all — it was insulin. Not only was it found in abundance, it ""looked considerably more like fish insulin than endogenous snail insulin."" The team synthesized the hormone and tested it on fish finding that the insulin lowered glucose levels in the blood and caused hypoactivity after being absorbed through the gills of the fish. Cone snails can be grouped into fish-, mollusk-, and worm-hunting varieties, and the team at the University of Utah studied several representatives of each. Early research into these other, non fish-hunting types shows that they produce insulin specific to their prey — which suggests they produce a weaponized insulin as well.   The newly discovered tactic is unique for a few reasons. While the other 100 or so species of cone snail also create insulin, theirs is an insulin typical to invertebrate mollusks. The specialized insulin produced by Conus geographus and Conus tulipa, however, is more characteristic of insulin found in vertebrate fish — 90 percent of the amino acids that make it up are similar to that of the zebrafish and white sucker fish, for example. Additionally, insulin has never been described as part of an animal venom, according to Safavi. Inducing hypoglycemic shock in prey has not been reported for any other venomous animal. That said, there are other predators that have venom components that target the metabolism of their prey, like the Heloderma suspectum species of gila monster. But as Safavi sees it, the importance of the study is that it shows how evolution can turn good compounds into bad ones. It's another weapon in a long line of clever techniques used by venomous animals when it comes to capturing prey.

The finding, the researchers say, could one day lead to human treatments. But in the meantime, the study hints that scientists need to investigate oxytocin levels in humans to find out which type of autism spectrum disorder, if any, would be most likely to benefit from an eventual oxytocin-based drug. ""We are able to improve social behavior using oxytocin"" About 1 in 68 children have some form of autism spectrum disorder, according to the CDC, and it’s about five times more common in boys. There is no cure for autism, and the disorder is costly: taking care of a child with autism spectrum disorder costs about $17,000 more per year than caring for a child without it, the CDC says. That estimate includes services like therapy, education, and caregiver time — all aspects of a child’s life that could benefit from a treatment that improves the way a child interacts with other human beings. In the study, researchers investigated the effects of oxytocin on adult and juvenile mice who have been genetically modified to display symptoms of autism. Oxytocin improved the social behavior of both groups: the treated mice were more likely to choose interacting with another mouse over inspecting an inanimate object compared with mice who hadn’t been treated with oxytocin. But the effects only lasted a few hours in the adults. The juveniles remained more social for about a week after stopping the treatment. The researchers obtained the same results when they gave the mice a drug that triggers the natural release of oxytocin in the brain. There might be a critical period in which you can jumpstart the natural release of oxytocin in the brain ""We are able to improve social behavior using oxytocin in a mouse model of autism, and in general the effect lasts a couple of hours,"" says Daniel Geschwind, a neurologist at The University of California, Los Angeles, and a co-author of the study. ""However, if you treat the animals early, it seems that there can be a longer-lasting effect."" This suggests that  there might be a critical period in which you can jumpstart the natural release of oxytocin in the brain. Unfortunately, Geshwind says, the researchers don’t know yet if the longer effect lasts when the mice get older. This is something that they hope to look at next. Richard Tsien, a neuroscientist at New York University who didn’t participate in the study, says that he was impressed that the approach had such ""a big effect — a doubling of social interaction time."" This means that cells that release oxytocin and the circuits that respond to oxytocin are basically working, he says, even in the mouse model of autism — they just need a boost. ""It's not an absolute failure of development as some might have predicted."" the ""love hormone"" increases envy and decreases cooperation in humans This is just the first of many studies, Geschwin says. ""We need to refine our understanding of when the optimal dose is to give the long-lasting effect."" But even if the researchers find out more about oxytocin's effect on mice, it’s still possible that the results will fail to translate to humans. ""Until one uses the mouse data to develop a therapy that is successful in humans,"" he says, ""it’s impossible [to know] with certainty."" If oxytocin does end up being helpful in humans, however, it’s likely that it will only work for some forms of autism spectrum disorder. Oxytocin has been referred to as ""the love hormone"" in the past, but previous studies have found that it may also increase envy and decrease cooperation in humans, in addition to facilitating social bonding. This means that it’s likely that the circumstance in which the drug is given to humans — as well as the sex and age of the recipient — might be important in determining its effects. ""That’s why my sense is that the best way to start with human trials of oxytocin is to target those with known oxytocin defects,"" a defect that has actually yet to be identified in autism, Geschwin says. ""While much work remains to be done to understand [the findings],"" Tsien says, ""this is a terrific start.""",0.6605022375230519,0.3394977624769481,0.6520884882476295,754,4.9071618037135281,364,6.0796703296703294,0,0,"Science, Report",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Schmidt later clarified that while the software was blocked in the latest version of Firefox, Mozilla will enable support for Flash as default for its browser when Adobe releases a version that isn't being actively exploited by known vulnerabilities. The company has previously blocked Flash, Java, and a range of other plugins and software when they were found to have security holes. Schmidt also noted that Firefox users can still choose to enable Flash in the settings menu if they wish. BIG NEWS!!

Dislike for the software isn't new: Steve Jobs memorably explained his problems with Flash in an open letter published back in 2010, but it's somehow clung doggedly to life, barely surviving the discovery of multiple critical security vulnerabilities every year. Most recently 400GB of files uncovered in the Hacking Team leak revealed some serious flaws in Flash that the spyware company used to force their way into target computers. Adobe has scrambled to fix problems as they have become public, but the web's biggest companies have slowly withdrawn support from the software over the past few years. YouTube dropped Flash as its default player in favor of HTML5 in January, and Chrome now intelligently pauses instances of Flash video on its pages — even Adobe stopped active development of Flash Player for mobile in 2011, recognizing it as inferior to HTML5. This latest wave of anti-Flash action might not kill it immediately, but it should at least mark the beginning of the end for the software. Correction: Mark Schmidt clarified Firefox's support for Flash in a tweet sent some time after his first, noting that future versions of the software may again be enabled by default if Adobe releases a new version.",0.3053356319145777,0.6946643680854223,0.8745790657952367,409,5.146699266503667,237,5.9367088607594933,0,0,"Culture, Web",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

To imagine what modern Chinese propaganda would look like, two British artists commissioned a North Korean group that once made propaganda for their own state, creating a series of paintings that are a mix between eerie dystopias and picturesque scenes pocked by an unsettling feeling. The works are part of a long-running and ongoing series called The Beautiful Future, and they recently finished a showing in Beijing. Though many of the paintings prominently feature stadiums made for the 2008 Olympic games in China, the British artists — Nick Bonner and Dominic Johnson-Hill — began work before the buildings had been made, reports the Guardian. That required the artists to send detailed sketches and renderings of the buildings' plans to the painters in North Korea so that they could be properly rendered for their propaganda-style posters. ""The artists are ... painting things they've never seen before ... which gives the images an even more unreal, dreamlike quality,” Bonner tells the Guardian. ""We wanted to show contemporary China as it could have been, if it had continued with Maoist ideology."" (Above: 'Birds Nest, Home of the People'.

These kinetic sculptures are hardly static — thanks to the wind, they move in mesmerizing patterns that The Creators Project described as ""real-world screensavers."" Beyond the visual spectacle, Howe's design process is a combination of modern technology and traditional metalwork processes. His pieces start as computer models that he designs with the CAD program Rhinoceros 3D, and then the designs are cut with a plasma cutter and assembled by hand. That 3D design process is crucial to the wild visual effects found in his finished work — it allows him to see how the sculptures will move before he goes through the work of actually building them. Howe puts his work through a pretty rigorous process to make sure it'll stand the test of time, as well. ""I try to overbuild my work,"" he says. ""The best way to test it is to bolt one of the sculptures to my Ford F-150 and drive down the freeway."" Still, much of his designs appear to be best suited to a low wind which leads to the slower, hypnotic motion that defines much of his work. ""Anything will work in a 50-knot wind, you know... just put a piece of metal out on the table and it'll blow away, that's kinetic,"" Howe says. ""But to make it spin at about one knot, that's harder."" To see Howe's work in motion, check out the video from The Creators Project below — and visit Howe's site to see all of his work. And if you want to see it in person, Howe's bringing his biggest creation to Burning Man next year: it'll be 30 feet wide, 30 feet deep, and 25 feet high and will require an 18-wheeler to get out to the festival.

From subtle wordplay to carefully chosen imagery, Apple has a history of dropping hints and hiding details about its next announcement right on the invitations it sends out for each event. We've collected most of Apple's invitations over the last decade to see just how those hints were hidden, where Apple left no hints at all, and just what it all might mean for the company's next event. This story was updated on August 29th, 2014 to include Apple's ""wish we could say more"" invitation. Macworld 2007: There may be no obvious hints on Apple's Macworld 2007 invitation, but it came with a bold proclamation that everything was about to change. Bold as it was, Apple lived up to the claim: it introduced the very first iPhone.WWDC 2008: A second Golden Gate Bridge? The hint isn't an entirely clear one, but Apple did offer developers a second road to go down: iOS. It launched the App Store alongside the iPhone 3G that June. WWDC 2009: Maybe it was just a simple message to developers, or maybe Apple was hiding the iPhone 3GS right in front of us — either way, it was certainly one of the less exciting invitations it's sent out.WWDC 2010: While the iPhone 4 was the star of this WWDC, a big part of the story was apps. Apple gave a release date for iOS 4, which finally brought multitasking and added support for folders to keep all those apps organized. October 2011: At the time, rumors that Apple would release two phones just wouldn't go away. But a big red ""1"" made it clear that we'd only be seeing a single new device that time around: the iPhone 4S.September 2012: This time, Apple couldn't have been more clear. 2012 wouldn't just bring another iPhone design update, it'd have a brand-new device deserving of the name iPhone 5.  September 2013: Colorful circles speckled the invitation, including one with an odd silver ring around it. As it turned out, Apple was hiding the home button for the iPhone 5S right in plain sight.WWDC 2013: Bright colors, gradients, and flat layers? Apple's WWDC 2013 logo certainly gave away a first impression of what was to come in iOS 7, even if it didn't go so far as to perfectly mimic it.  January 2010: There was no obvious allusion to any of Apple's existing products here. Apple promised a new creation though, and it certainly delivered with the original iPad. March 2011: This year, Apple made it clear that a new iPad was on the way. And while the date may have been just a coincidence, it matched up quite nicely with the announcement of the iPad 2.  March 2012: No, Apple wasn't about to introduce haptic feedback. But it did have a sharp new Retina display for the iPad. October 2012: As rumors of a smaller iPad gained momentum, Apple came along promising something ""little."" In fact, Apple actually had quite a bit to show off that October, but the star of the show was the iPad mini.  October 2013: ""Cover"" wasn't a sly turn of phrase toward an Apple-made smart cover — Apple, quite literally, just had a lot to talk about this year. That included refreshed MacBook Pros and the full reveal of its long-awaited, fully revamped Mac Pro. For most, though, the show's biggest news was the iPad Air and an iPad mini with a Retina display. September 2007: After releasing the original iPhone, Apple was ready to show off what was next to come for the iPod. As it turned out, it would be the iPod touch — something the invitation suggested with its Cover Flow theme.September 2008: Though Apple's invitation depicted an iPod classic, the classic didn't see all that much attention. Instead, Apple update the design on both the iPod touch and iPod nano.  September 2009: Apple again made it clear that it'd be talking music, but there was little hint as to what. This event brought updates to just about every iPod, though there was nothing too major in the scheme of things. September 2010: No clever phrase accompanied the invitation for Apple's 2010 music event, making hints hard to come by. Apple updated the iPod touch, debuted the tiny, square iPod nano, and — regrettably — introduced Ping.  Macworld 2008: With a clever turn of phrase, Apple teased the introduction of the original MacBook Air without giving away what it'd really be talking about. October 2008: Apple's invitation was fairly straightforward this time around. But while we could have guessed that we'd see new MacBooks, the new unibody design was a big shift for the company's laptops.  October 2010: Apple may have made it clear that OS X Lion was coming, but it had one big secret up its sleeve: a redesigned MacBook Air — the very same design it still uses today.WWDC 2012: Sometimes, it seems like Apple just likes to use colors. While the squares that made up Apple's WWDC 2012 logo may have resembled app icons, the big story this year was the first MacBook Pro with Retina display.  October 2003: One of the biggest Apple stories of 2003 was the launch of the iTunes store. A few months later, Apple promised that ""story"" would get a little bit bigger, and it did: iTunes and its store launched on Windows.   September 2006: Hollywood lights hit the Apple logo for this event, which saw movies come to the iTunes store for the first time ever.  September 2005: Those familiar with the original iPod's slogan may have assumed this invitation was just pointing to the jeans' front pocket — but they'd have been wrong. When Steve Jobs first unveiled the iPod nano, it came right out of his coin pocket.     October 2005: Those aren't the curtains of just any theater. Apple was thinking of a movie theater when it launched the first iPod that could play video, while beginning to sell TV shows and music videos on iTunes for the first time too. January 2012: Apple wasn't hiding the subject of its education event, where it shifted focus into the classroom by making iBooks a whole lot more interactive.      WWDC 2011: In a surprising change of pace, Apple actually announced some of what would be shown off at WWDC 2011 before the event even happened. While the logo may not give anything away, Apple promised details on iOS 5 and the debut of iCloud.   This is going to be a big one. After what feels like years of rumblings, Apple is reported to finally be revealing its first wearable. Will it be a smartwatch? A fitness band? A health gadget? Something altogether new and different? This invitation isn't providing any easy hints. But ""wish we could say more"" is as cryptic a phrase as any that's graced an Apple invitation, so it's hard not to wonder if there's something more to it.Beyond that, Apple's said to be launching two new, redesigned iPhones at this event. One is expected to measure 4.7 inches, and the other is expected to measure 5.5-inches, making them both by far the largest phones that Apple has made yet.We'll find out everything there is to know on Tuesday, September 9th starting at 1PM ET / 10AM PT, and you'll be able to tune into The Verge to catch all of the news live.

The latest take is by the San Francisco startup Need/Want, which plans to sell physical notebooks that are meant to be filled up, shipped away, and then digitized before automatically appearing on the note taker's tablet or smartphone. The idea is to let people who prefer real notebooks just use a real notebook, but then to make all of their doodles, diagrams, and comments easily accessible online.    A subscription service for notebooks Both the notebooks and their accompanying app are called Draft, and they're being launched through a Kickstarter campaign that begins today. This will be Need/Want's second time heading to Kickstarter — the first try successfully funded a bedding product — and its looking for $20,000 in order to make the notebooks a reality. Eventually, Need/Want plans to sell the notebooks through a subscription model, mailing you a new one every month alongside a return label to ship back the previous notebook.   The concept isn't an entirely novel one though: Evernote began selling notebooks in partnership with Moleskine last year which could be digitized just by using just your phone's camera (meaning you didn't lose your notebook in the end either). But though Need/Want requires that you take the surprisingly analog step of mailing your notebook away, it still intends to make the entire process much cheaper, around just $14 per notebook including shipping and scanning — $10 less than Evernote's least expensive model.

Leading the recipients this year is James Wines, who has earned a lifetime achievement award for the architectural work of his SITE design firm. Wines and his colleagues have made it a priority to design ""environmentally oriented buildings, interiors, gardens, and public spaces."" Among those projects is a Denny's location unlike any you've ever seen.  TED picked up the award for corporate achievement thanks to its enormously popular annual conference and TED Talks, which have amassed over 1 billion times online. Accolades for product design went to NewDealDesign, the San Francisco-based studio responsible for designing Fitbit's line of fitness trackers, the innovative Lytro camera, and several iterations of the Slingbox, among other technology staples. Other recipients have been recognized for their esteemed accomplishments in interior work, interactive design, and landscape architecture. Studio Gang Architects took home the award for overall architecture design, for a body of work that includes the Bengt Sjostrom Starlight Theatre and the Nature Boardwalk at Lincoln Park Zoo.

A new report from Wired reveals a new attack on the service, allowing researchers to reveal all the posts written by a given author. The attack is simple: researchers at Rhino Security created a network of dummy accounts and left the target's email as the only real name in their contact list. From afar, it looked like they had a big group of friends, so Secret let them use the app normally, but really it was one real person surrounded by dummies. Since there was only one real account, they could conclude that any posts that showed up were written by the target. The result is a full list of your favorite friend's Secret posts, all indelibly tied to his or her name. It's not a novel attack so much as a brief slip in Secret's war on bots To a lot of people in the security world, this is old news. The attack has been known for a while, and it works off a vulnerability that's built into the nature of Secret itself. The app's main anonymity protection is the friend pool. You need a few dozen contacts to join, so any individual post could have come from a few dozen different accounts. All you need to beat it is a few dozen dummy accounts, so the fight is always between attackers making bots and Secret weeding them out. Rhino broke through lately because for some reason Secret's anti-bot services have been slacking in the past few weeks. As soon as they learned about the vulnerability, the company closed the loophole, presumably by tuning the bot protections back to previous levels. It's not a novel attack so much as a brief slip in Secret's war on bots. But who says you need bots at all? Dummy accounts are the fastest way to get enough contacts, especially if you're trying to code your way inside, but why not just make 35 friends who don't post? There's no way for Secret to protect against that. Even Poulsen's example of a sensitive post — ""At work I'm being given more and more responsibility. Silently I'm struggling with mental illness"" — gives away more than a few clues. You can rule out your unemployed friends off the bat. Has anyone gotten a raise lately? It's always possible to Poirot your way back to the source.  It's always possible to Poirot your way back to the source That's part of why Secret bills itself as ""anonymish"" rather than fully secure. It's a strange word: how can you be halfway anonymous? In part, it means you end up trusting your followers not to do too much legwork. Like a masquerade ball, the secrecy is more social than technological. Secret wants to be a place where you can slip out of your identity for a while, but the company has never bothered with the rigors of hard security. The service has it both ways, offering the warm glow of anonymity without the stress of the OpSec world. It's a good idea, but it comes with a price. From time to time, security veterans like Rhino will call the service out — and anyone who's shared something sensitive on Secret will have to wonder whether they've made a mistake.",0.46352653266807464,0.5364734673319254,0.22103191960018495,554,4.4801444043321297,311,5.418006430868167,0,0,Business,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

But instead they end up in every corner of the house, under couch cushions and behind the bureau, gathering dust. A new app being released to the public today, Acorns, can't solve my problem with physical coins, but it does the equivalent with every digital dollar I spend. The app links to any	credit or debit	card and	automatically rounds up	purchases to the nearest full dollar, investing	the rounded-up cents into a portfolio of index funds. You could always add a lump sum to your account, but the ""spare change"" approach is meant to gently nudge users toward regular contributions. It's an attempt to take the complex and often expensive process of putting your savings to work and simplifying it down into a mobile app with some basic choices and minimal fees.  Users can swipe through five different options that vary in terms of risk and reward, aiming for a higher return if they have more of a financial cushion to fall back on. But there is no option to pick individual stocks or asset classes. ""We don't believe that people can really time the market,"" says said	Jeff Cruttenden, co-founder	and	COO	of	Acorns. ""We focus less on beating the market and more on index portfolios where we can capture the market and keep fees low.""  That's a strategy which is becoming increasingly popular with ordinary investors. Acorns invests in index funds offered by Blackrock and Vanguard, which recently topped $3 trillion in assets, and helped to pioneer the passive approach to retail investing. Unlike going direct with those big names, Acorns has no	commissions,	no minimum	account	balances,	and	no	penalties	on withdrawals. It charges a flat $1-a-month fee and a 0.25 percent to 0.5 percent management fee on the money invested, compared to the mutual fund average of 1.29 percent. For most people, being able to afford life's big-ticket items — kids, mortgage, retirement — means putting money into investments that grow in value over time. Realistically most people should start investing in their 20s, but almost half of millennials keep all their money in savings, the equivalent of stuffing cash in your mattress.  ""In college, I noticed three main reasons why people struggled to start investing,"" says Cruttenden.  ""One, people struggled to put together a lump sum to meet minimum account balances; two, commissions make it uneconomical to invest even a few hundred dollars at a time; and three, when people are presented with too many options (thousands of stocks, bonds, etc.) they tend to make no decision or delay it.""

Interviews with current and former contractors, along with internal documents obtained by The Verge, outline the company’s evolving methods. Using contractors it calls ""brand ambassadors,"" Uber requests rides from Lyft and other competitors, recruits their drivers, and takes multiple precautions to avoid detection. The effort, which Uber appears to be rolling out nationally, has already resulted in thousands of canceled Lyft rides and made it more difficult for its rival to gain a foothold in new markets. Uber calls the program ""SLOG,"" and it’s a previously unreported aspect of the company’s ruthless efforts to undermine its competitors. Together, the interviews and documents show the lengths to which Uber will go to halt its rivals’ momentum. The San Francisco startup has raised $1.5 billion in venture capital, giving it an enormous war chest with which to battle Lyft and others. While the company’s cutthroat nature is well documented, emails from Uber managers offer new insight into the shifting tactics it uses to siphon drivers away from competitors without getting caught. It also demonstrates the strong interest Uber has taken in crushing Lyft, its biggest rival in ridesharing, which is in the midst of a national expansion. After The Verge asked Uber for comment on its report, the company stalled for time until they could write this blog post introducing Operation SLOG to the world. ""We never use marketing tactics that prevent a driver from making their living — and that includes never intentionally canceling rides,"" the company said. Earlier this month, CNN reported that Uber employees around the country ordered and then canceled 5,560 Lyft rides, according to an analysis by Lyft. (Lyft arrived at this figure by cross-referencing the phone numbers of users who tried to recruit Lyft drivers to Uber with users who had previously canceled rides.) Uber flatly denied trying to sabotage its competitor: ""Lyft’s claims against Uber are baseless and simply untrue,"" the company said. ""Uber is flat-out lying to their customers."" But one Uber contractor The Verge spoke with said Lyft’s complaint had merit. ""What’s simply untrue is that not only does Uber know about this, they’re actively encouraging these actions day-to-day and, in doing so, are flat-out lying both to their customers, the media, and their investors,"" the contractor said. Until now, the canceled Lyft rides have been understood as a kind of prank call designed to keep competitors’ drivers off the road. But interviews and internal documents suggest another reason: Uber’s recruitment program has vastly increased in size and sophistication, and recruiters cancel rides in part to avoid detection by Lyft. The ground troops in Uber’s sabotage campaign are the company’s ambassadors, some of whom it hires through TargetCW, a San Diego-based employment agency. For the most part, ambassadors work at events or on college campuses, promoting Uber as a cheap and easy way of getting around town. The primary goal is to recruit riders, not drivers, and Uber calls the activity ""slanging."" But since at least mid-summer, some brand ambassadors in New York have been turning their talents against Lyft. Using Uber-provided iPhones and credit cards, the contractors hail rides, strike up conversations with their drivers, and attempt to sign them up before they arrive at their destination. (In other cities recruiters travel with ""driver kits"" that include iPhones and everything else a driver needs to get started on Uber; ambassadors were told New York State does not allow this.) Compensation varies, but contractors can earn a $750 commission for successfully recruiting a single new driver to Uber, according to a contractor. Organizing a street team As Lyft has gotten better at sniffing out recruiters and banning them from the service, Uber has been forced to alter its tactics. In the run-up to Lyft’s high-profile launch last month in New York City, Uber organized a ""street team"" to analyze Lyft’s expansion strategy. On July 9th, a marketing manager emailed a subset of the company’s contractors in New York city with a new opportunity. ""We have a special ongoing project that we’re going to be rolling out next week and I wanted to get about 8–10 of you to help out,"" he wrote. ""This is going to be completely based on your own personal hustle, as it’s not a typical onsite event. We are going to have you working on your own time helping us sign up Uber drivers, and there is HUGE commission opportunity for everyone you signup."" The special ongoing project had a different codename: SLOG. Contractors in New York who responded to the ""special ongoing project"" message were invited to individual hour-long meetings with Uber marketing managers, who had traveled from Los Angeles and Washington, DC, to New York to oversee the team’s creation. It was there that the company laid out its plan, according to a contractor. With Lyft’s arrival in New York imminent, Uber said it was creating a ""street team"" charged with gathering intelligence about Lyft’s launch plans and recruiting their drivers to Uber. Contractors were then handed two Uber-branded iPhones and a series of valid credit card numbers to be used for creating dummy Lyft accounts. Uber assumed every contractor would be caught by Lyft eventually; the second phone, according to a contractor interviewed by The Verge, was issued so ""you would have a backup phone if and when that happened so you wouldn’t have to go back."" Backup phones for days A follow-up email outlined the process for recruiting Lyft drivers in detail. It emphasizes the importance of requesting rides from different physical locations so as not to arouse Lyft’s suspicions, suggests methods of recruiting, and outlines the process for signing up drivers on Uber’s platform.   The message linked to an online form, which was still active as this story went to press, where Uber could collect information about the Lyft drivers.   As their plans evolved, Uber realized the likelihood that Lyft drivers would be recruited multiple times by its team members and alert Lyft about the street team’s existence. The solution: a private group on the messaging app GroupMe where members of the street team could post Lyft driver profiles. That way, Uber contractors could make sure their Lyft driver had not already been pitched. ""You guys will run into drivers you have already got in cars with,"" a Los Angeles-based marketing manager emailed the team. ""Post the driver profiles in groupme when you request so people are aware."" In messages to the contractors, Uber’s marketing managers are full of good cheer. ""Hello my lovely Sloggers!"" begins one note, which gives instructions for filling out some paperwork. Once that’s out of the way, she writes, ""then it’s all the little Lyfts your hearts desire."" She ends her sentence with the hashtag #shavethestache, a reference to the big pink mustaches Lyft drivers affix to their vehicles’ grilles.   Uber appears to be replicating its program across the country. One email obtained by The Verge links to an online form for requesting burner phones, credit cards, and driver kits — everything an Uber driver needs to get started, which recruiters often carry with them. The form lists 10 cities, including LA, Seattle, Boston, Miami, and Washington, DC. ""We are growing and growing so with that said this will put some organization to your madness,"" says the form, which was still live at the time of publication. ""I need BA phones to make a lyft account,"" reads one line, referring to brand ambassadors; ""Great how many do you need,"" reads the line below. ""This will put some organization to your madness!""   Uber’s aggressive tactics reflect the fact that ridesharing is largely a zero-sum game: a driver picking up an Uber customer can’t simultaneously pick up a Lyft customer. (Drivers are allowed to drive for both services, though the companies discourage the practice.) Having more active drivers on the road creates a virtuous circle that improves geographical coverage, increases demand, and allows services to lower prices by taking a smaller cut from a growing number of rides. Uber and Lyft are competing to become the first app you think of when you need a taxi, and the service with the most drivers likely stands the best chance of winning. That helps to explain why competition between the two has become so vicious, with Uber and Lyft both offering hefty bonuses and other perks to drivers who switch services. For a time, Uber lost money on every ride to help spur demand. And Lyft has itself aggressively recruited Uber drivers, offering cash bonuses for joining, and hosting free taco lunches at its driver center. The Spy-vs.-Spy nature of their competition was revealed again earlier this month, when Uber caught wind of Lyft’s multi-passenger ridesharing offering and preemptively announced a nearly identical offering the night before Lyft made its announcement. Lyft declined to comment for this story. After Uber became aware that The Verge was asking questions, Target CW sent out multiple emails warning contractors that talking to the press violated a non-disclosure agreement they signed when they joined.",0.512471118175877,0.487528881824123,0.8380429812367115,1541,5.1855937702790396,744,6.478494623655914,0,8,"Business, Tech, Exclusive, Report",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

According to Apple's documentation, these videos can run 15, 30, or 60 seconds in length. iAds were originally introduced as an alternative to mobile advertising that would take users outside of an app and into the browser when tapped. Apple offered developers a way to add advertising to their apps with a few lines of code, and a system that would open interactive ads inside the application without jettisoning people away from what they were doing. That system was available on top of Apple's own in-app purchase, which for a time was only available for paid apps. Nonetheless, Apple's had troubles wrestling share from Google, which offers its ads on multiple platforms, including Apple's. AdWeek caught wind of the new formats back in March.

Founder Drew Houston has often said that Dropbox customers aren't focused on the price, so long as they get a service that works. But with competitors like Google Drive and Microsoft OneDrive relentlessly cutting their prices, Dropbox has found itself under increasing pressure to respond in kind. Today, it's relenting. Today Dropbox announced a revamped version of its paid offering for individuals, called Dropbox Pro, that costs $9.99 a month for 1 terabyte of storage. Previously, $9.99 got you just 100 gigabytes; storage maxed out at 500GB, which cost a whopping $500 a year. (All existing Pro customers will be upgraded to the new plan over the next few days.) Along with the new price come features aimed mostly at freelancers, consultants, and solo entrepreneurs: the ability to share links with password protection, to share links that expire on a certain date, and to share some files in ""read-only"" mode. (It works best with software that has a native read-only mode, like Microsoft Office and Adobe Photoshop.) Pro users also get the ability to remotely wipe a lost or missing device.   Those features were already available to business users, who pay $15 per person a month. Today's move makes it easier for people like real estate agents or wedding photographers to make Dropbox the center of their working life. And the pro pricing brings Dropbox in line with Google, which also charges $9.99 a month for 1TB of storage. OneDrive is running a promotion for 1TB for $2.50 a month. That leaves Amazon as the most expensive of the big players for now: it charges $500 a year for 1TB of storage on its Cloud Drive, or $41.67 a month. Houston is mostly right that Dropbox customers aren't primarily concerned with price. But it couldn't afford to ignore its competitors forever. The new Pro offering looks useful, if not revolutionary. But until its rivals drop their prices once again, Dropbox can stop competing on price and continue competing on service.

In a big profile today, Business Insider looks at the case of Educational Development Corporation (EDC) — the publisher of titles like Everyone Poops — which has managed to break free from Amazon and actually succeed on its own. EDC's business was declining when it decided to cut off Amazon sales back in 2012 in a dramatic move to spur a turnaround.

The company has since confirmed the news, and a press release states Amazon will pay $970 million in cash. At first glance this marriage doesn't make a lot of sense. Amazon isn't well known as a gaming service and its video offerings are principally from film and television studios, not user-generated content. But when you look at where these two companies are trying to go, not where they currently sit, the combination of Amazon and Twitch could be genius.   Amazon has been courting the gaming market for a while Gamers were upset when it was reported back in May that Google was acquiring Twitch, the video game streaming platform, and planning to integrate with YouTube. The service was tightly linked with the gaming community and many were worried about how it would fare inside a big corporate parent. But it was hard to argue with the billion-dollar price tag, and in a lot of ways Twitch and YouTube were already forming a perfect complement to one another, with Twitch the best choice for live streams of video games, but most archived videos performing best over time on YouTube. Amazon is clearly very keen to get into gaming. It created its in-house gaming studio back in 2012 and has made a few lightweight Facebook and mobile games since then. It signaled it was getting more serious with the acquisition of Killer Instinct developer Double Helix Games and hiring of Kim Swift, the designer behind the classic Portal game. The company's new Fire TV offered a selection of games created by Amazon's in-house team and even has a Amazon joystick you can buy separately, hinting at aspirations to compete with consoles like the Xbox and PlayStation. The company already sells everything under the sun, so it only makes sense for them to add games to the books, films, and TV shows they offer, but getting the love and respect of that community is tough. Twitch has gamer support in spades. According to a source familiar with the deal, Amazon is the biggest digital distributor of games after Valve's Steam store, and it believes Twitch could help it to capture even more of that market. Twitch needed a big partner to support its growth For Twitch, being acquired was always about finding a partner that could help it keep up with its massive growth. As The Verge reported back in May, Twitch was being offered hundreds of millions in new funding from its previous investors, but felt that it simply couldn't scale with capital alone. It needed a company with global infrastructure already in place that it could piggyback on. YouTube certainly fit the bill. But Amazon, with its Amazon Web Services (AWS), also has the kind of international presence to ensure Twitch can stream live video to millions across every continent. Twitch in turn could be the live-streaming platform that powers everything from gaming to concerts to sporting events that play on Amazon's family of Fire devices. Speaking with The Verge, Twitch CEO Emmett Shear said AWS was also attractive because it is already used by so many game developers. ""As we saw with Twitch Plays Pokemon, there is an appetite for new games created around our platform. So many developers are already running AWS, it's a very attractive thing for us to be close to."" Increasingly, Twitch was also running into licensing issues as it grew in size. In recent weeks it's made changes to the way it handles in-game music, muting a lot of copyrighted background tracks when it doesn't have agreements in place to cover for archived video. YouTube has dealt with this issue a lot, and certainly seemed like the perfect partner to ensure a broad licensing deal. Amazon doesn't have the same experience dealing with numerous copyright claims against user-generated content, but it does have the deep pocketbooks and relationships in place with the big record labels who appear on its streaming music service. ""Amazon has built relationships with the big players in media, and that is very attractive for us,"" says Shear. ""There are a lot of important partnerships there for Twitch that might have taken years to to forge on our own."" Why would Twitch choose Amazon over Google? It wasn't the money, with Amazon's purchase price being equal or less than Google's reported offer. Shear wouldn't answer that question directly, but did provide detail on why Amazon was the best fit. ""One of the things that really stood out about Amazon was their approach to acquisitions. We will be a wholly owned subsidiary and and I will remain CEO,"" said Shear. ""They have a long term vision about how to create big opportunities in the future by investing today."" Reading between the lines a little, it sounds like Twitch felt at Google, it would have always been YouTube's little brother. At Amazon, it has the chance to build something from scratch, as Amazon has no user-generated or live video offerings yet. A source familiar with the deal suggested Twitch felt Amazon would give it more autonomy and bigger role in growing the gaming business. This deal could radically shift the landscape of live video. With both Twitch and YouTube, Google would have huge stakes in two of the biggest, fastest-growing user-generated video platforms on earth. Given Jeff Bezos' ambitions, it's no surprise he's willing to pay nearly a billion dollars to remain a contender for that future. Luckily for him, Amazon's reputation for sacrificing profits in favor of ambitious bets convinced Twitch the house of Bezos was the best place to keep building.

Back in May, the venture-capital firm Kleiner Perkins reportedly committed to investing up to $20 million in Snapchat at this high valuation. At least one other investor is also said to be taking part in this round of funding, which reportedly is not yet closed. Alibaba was previously reported to be involved as well, though it's now said to have passed. Snapchat has raised several rounds of funding prior to this, but all at a lower valuation.  ""Capital requirements are the least exciting aspects of supporting the Snapchat community."" This new valuation easily places Snapchat among the most highly valued tech startups around — perhaps a surprising fact given that Snapchat isn't yet bringing in money. That's expected to change soon, however. The Journal previously reported that a service called Snapchat Discovery is being prepared for launch this November, and that it'll display articles, videos, and ads to users of the app. Existing newspapers, magazines, and TV networks would reportedly provide content for Discovery, which will reportedly work much like existing snaps do. Snapchat also has what appears to be a pretty big audience ready to consume all of that: a recent Pew study found that over a quarter of 18-29 year olds are using it. Startups quite often hit a rough patch when they begin introducing advertisements into their previously ad-free service, but Snapchat has largely been on a winning streak as far as introducing new elements to its app goes. Still, the funding will provide Snapchat with a lot more leeway as it begins evolving into a more mature (and sustainable) product — and Snapchat is trying to keep the story focused on the app, not the company. ""The valuation of our business and our capital requirements are the least exciting aspects of supporting the Snapchat community,"" a Snapchat spokesperson tells the Journal, when asked for comment on its funding report. ""We have no further comment at this time.""",0.5234126901020154,0.4765873098979846,0.7688469427519834,368,5.0733695652173916,234,5.6538461538461542,0,0,"Apps, Business",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

In a 3-to-2 vote, the Federal Communications Commission today established a new Open Internet Order that implements strict net neutrality rules, including prohibitions on site and app blocking, speed throttling, and paid fast lanes.  A huge win for net neutrality Critically, the order also reclassifies internet providers' offerings as telecommunications services under Title II of the Communications Act. Though this is likely to provoke a challenge in court, Title II gives the commission the tools it needs to enforce these strict rules. This is also the first time that net neutrality rules will apply, in full, to mobile internet service. Additionally, the commission uses the new order to assert its ability to investigate and address complaints about ""interconnect"" agreements — deals made between internet providers like Comcast and content companies like Netflix, which has regularly complained that these deals are unfair. The FCC's new order establishes a standard that requires internet providers to take no actions that unreasonably interfere with or disadvantage consumers or the companies whose sites and apps they're trying to access. At most, internet providers may slow down service only for the purpose of ""reasonable network management"" — not a business purpose. Title II is the FCC's strongest tool for enforcing open internet rules This is a huge win for net neutrality advocates. Since the commission's original net neutrality rules were struck down in court last year, advocates have been pushing for the FCC to use utility-style Title II reclassification when implementing a new order. For a while, it didn't look like that was going to happen. Commission chairman Tom Wheeler initially proposed rules that seemingly undermined the entire concept of net neutrality by allowing paid fast lanes. But earlier this month, following support from President Obama and millions of public comments spurred on by a popular John Oliver segment and advocacy from major websites like Netflix, Kickstarter, and Tumblr, Wheeler announced the dramatically overhauled new plan that was pushed through today. ""The action that we take today is an irrefutable reflection of the principle that no one, whether government or corporate, should control free and open access to the internet,"" Wheeler said. ""We cannot have a two-tiered internet with fast lanes that speed the traffic of the privileged and leave the rest of us lagging behind,"" commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel said at today's meeting. ""We cannot have gatekeepers who tell us what we can and cannot do and where we can and cannot go online.  And we do not need blocking, throttling, and paid prioritization schemes that undermine the internet as we know it."" ""We have to add net neutrality to a list of basic market conditions that we protect."" Commissioner Mignon Clyburn also spoke strongly in favor of the order. ""We are here because we want to give those with deep pockets and those with empty pockets the same opportunities to succeed,"" she said. Clyburn notes that, while she voted in favor of the 2010 rules, today's order is far closer to what she originally supported. Clyburn also says that a minor classification change has been made to the proposal to address one of her concerns with it — an issue that Google and Free Press both agreed with her on. That said, Clyburn says that she would have liked to see the ""unreasonable discrimination rule"" from the 2010 order used here instead of the unreasonably interference rule, and that isn't being changed. As the vote makes clear, the entire commission isn't on board with the new rules. Both Republican commissioners, Michael O’Rielly and Ajit Pai, have expressed their disagreement with the order. Prior to the vote today, O'Rielly issued a statement arguing that the commission's decision-making power had been usurped by the administration for political purposes. He also argues that net neutrality is unnecessary, that Title II imposes overbearing regulation, and that Title II doesn't actually stand on solid legal footing. For comparison, he has previously drawn a line between 4K TV and interplanetary teleportation. Pai put forward a strong dissent as well, arguing that the commission was unable to act independently. ""We are flip-flopping for one reason and one reason only,"" Pai said. ""President Obama told us to do so."" Pai believes that implementing this order will lead to ""higher broadband prices, slower broadband speeds, less broadband deployment, less innovation, and fewer options for consumers."" He also questioned the commission's legal authority to implement the order. Advocates say net neutrality protects economic opportunities and diversity The commission also brought out a number of notable advocates to speak before the vote. That included Etsy CEO Chad Dickerson, Veena Sud, an executive producer for The Killing who appeared to be speaking on behalf of Netflix, and Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the web. Dickerson applauded the commission for protecting the internet ""as an engine for economic opportunity, the likes of which we have never seen."" Sud pointed to multiple Netflix series and cited the greater diversity you find online. Berners-Lee put his feelings quite simply: ""We have to add net neutrality to a list of basic market conditions that we protect."" The new rules should go into effect around two to three months from now, though the time will vary depending on how long it takes the commission to release the order to the Federal Register. The commissioners may still need to fix technical points in the order, which can be changed with unanimous agreement. Though this is an important victory for net neutrality advocates, their fight is not yet over. It is almost certain that one internet provider or another will challenge the rules in court, and those proceedings could take years, leaving the future of this order uncertain. The commission's chances in court look good, but there are a number of complications that it will likely have to address. This time, at least, the FCC is using the strongest tools that it has to implement these protections.

Wilson told the magazine that the companies were expressing a ""political preference"" and that there was nothing ""specifically related to firearms"" about the machine ""except the hocus pocus of the marketing."" The Ghost Gunner isn't illegal to own — neither are the guns it helps make The Ghost Gunner isn't illegal to own or operate and is sold with the express purpose of creating untraceable, semi-automatic 'ghost guns.' The site says that customers can simply ""plug GhostGunner into [their] computer, install our software"" and then start manufacturing from the design files, all of which are in the public domain. It adds that ""no prior CNC knowledge or experience is required."" The lower receiver is the focus of attention here because it is the component that legally constitutes a firearm in the US. This means it's controlled by federal regulations and sold with traceable serial numbers. However, selling semi-finished lower receivers and assembling unserialized weapons is completely legal. Enthusiasts have been creating their own lower receivers for years, but 3D-printing machines and cheap, computer-controlled mills are making this process more accessible than ever before.  In a statement given to Wired magazine, FedEx explained its reasons for the ban. ""This device is capable of manufacturing firearms, and potentially by private individuals,"" said the company. ""We are uncertain at this time whether this device is a regulated commodity by local, state, or federal governments. As such, to ensure we comply with the applicable law and regulations, FedEx declined to ship this device until we know more about how it will be regulated."" UPS echoed these sentiments, saying that it ""reserves the right to refuse to provide transportation service for, among other reasons, any shipments that create legal, safety or operational concerns."" It added that the company was ""continuing to evaluate such concerns with regard to the transportation of milling machines used to produce operable firearms but, at this point in time, will not accept such devices for transportation.""  ""the constitutionally protected right to make a rifle free from government surveillance."" In an email to Defense Distributed's supporters published by Ars Technica, Wilson stated that after the FedEx ban he was determined to keep selling the Ghost Gunner. ""I will find another way to ship the machine,"" he wrote. ""I emailed today because I feel you should know that FedEx is uncomfortable with the constitutionally protected right to make a rifle free from government surveillance."" He added that although the firm caters to the firearms industry (FedEx is a member of the National Rifle Association's Business Alliance) it has ""a specific antipathy to the non-commercial acquisition of firearms."" Incidents like this underscore the fact that although US gun law is some of the most scrutinized in the world, there will always be disagreements between what companies and individuals believe is legal and what they believe is right. Wilson and his supporters think that what they are doing is both, but corporations are obviously not so sure.",0.601557631151574,0.398442368848426,0.8450839275500877,595,5.356302521008403,346,6.4682080924855487,0,0,"Policy & Law, Tech, US & World",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

The decision was prompted by separate petitions from Wilson, North Carolina, and Chattanooga, Tennessee — both cities that've established high-speed, gigabit internet services, but have been barred from expanding to neighboring communities due to existing state laws. So far, 19 states have similar regulations to those that the FCC is overriding in Wilson and Chattanooga, but today's ruling affects only those two specific cases. The vote affects only two states, but sets a huge precedent Even so, the FCC's 3-2 vote will serve as a landmark moment that other communities will point to as they try to compete against commercial ISPs and knock down those deeply restrictive state laws. ""There are a few irrefutable truths about broadband,"" said FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler ahead of the vote. ""One is you can’t say you’re for broadband, and then turn around and endorse limits."" The commission has decided that Tennessee and North Carolina are needlessly preventing the ""reasonable and timely deployment of high-speed internet access to all Americans,"" a senior FCC official said during a press call a few weeks ago. It's not hard to see the exact same logic being applied elsewhere when other petitions are brought forward. ""You can’t say you’re for broadband, and then turn around and endorse limits."" If you're wondering where the FCC gets power to make these decisions, it's claiming that states are getting in the way of its authority — granted under Section 706 of the Telecommunications Act — to promote the deployment of broadband across the US. Here's how the FCC justified today's action in a press release that followed the successful vote: Under federal law, a federal agency may preempt state laws that conflict with its regulations or policies so long as it is acting within the scope of its authority.  There is a clear conflict, the Order finds, between Section 706 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which directs the FCC to take action to remove barriers to broadband investment and competition, and provisions of the Tennessee and North Carolina law that erect barriers to expansion of service into surrounding communities, including unserved and underserved areas. Unsurprisingly, the cable establishment and entrenched ISPs have lobbied against this becoming a trend, with the opposition (and dissenting commissioners) trying to frame it as an aggressive overreach of the FCC's authority. ""We don’t take lightly the matter of preempting state laws,"" admitted Wheeler. But the chairman made clear this was a situation in which the FCC saw no other choice but to act.

The arrests come amid growing anxiety surrounding unauthorized drones, or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which have been seen hovering above popular tourist sites and government buildings in recent weeks. For two consecutive nights this week, small, non-military drones were spotted above some of Paris’ most famous landmarks, including the Eiffel Tower and the Invalides military museum, as well as the US embassy and major traffic junctions along the city's border. At least five drones were reported by witnesses and police each night, but their operators have yet to be identified. Paris police obtained video footage of some of the drones Tuesday night and are studying it as part of the ongoing investigation. At this point, it's unclear whether the drones were flown as a prank, a harmless flyover, or part of a coordinated or sinister operation, but French authorities are taking no chances. ""It's a subject being taken very seriously."" ""There's no need to worry, but we should be vigilant,"" government spokesman Stephane Le Foll told reporters Wednesday. ""It's a subject being taken very seriously."" The journalists arrested Wednesday don’t appear to be linked to the drones seen overnight Monday and Tuesday. In a statement to The Guardian, an Al Jazeera spokesman said the journalists were actually filming a report on the drones seen earlier in the week. The journalist who operated the drone will appear in court next week, while the other two have been freed. France has relatively stringent laws governing the use of civilian or commercial UAVs and is home to more than 1,200 commercial drone companies. (The US, by comparison, only recently adopted regulations for small commercial drones.) Operators can fly drones without a license below an altitude of 500 feet, but not above highly populated areas or sensitive government locations. In Paris, it’s illegal to fly any aircraft below 19,600 feet without a license, and flying UAVs at night is banned altogether. Offenders face a maximum one-year prison sentence and a €75,000 ($85,000) fine. But these regulations haven’t stopped rogue operators from flying UAVs above sensitive sites. Between October and January, drones were reported flying above at least 13 nuclear power plants, and the operators’ identities remain unknown. In January, a drone was spotted above the Élysée Palace, home to President Francois Hollande. Tensions are already high following Charlie Hebdo attacks Speaking to reporters this week, Le Foll stressed that mystery drones aren’t a uniquely French problem, pointing to similar incidents in Germany and the US, where a drone crash landed in front of the White House earlier this year. But Paris’ suspicious flyovers come at a time of heightened security concerns across France, following last month's flurry of jihadist attacks that began at the offices of the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo. The government deployed thousands of police and military personnel to protect sensitive areas following the attacks, which left 17 dead, as part of a $480 million anti-terror program. Following the nuclear plant incidents last year, France tasked its national research agency with developing new technologies to detect and intercept small commercial drones. That’s difficult to do at the moment, because smaller UAVs are hard to identify with radar systems, and techniques like radio frequency jamming could pose risks to other infrastructure. ""expect to see more people pushing the boundaries."" Authorities say the drones spotted above the plants posed no immediate threat, but there are concerns that they could fall and injure civilians when flown above densely populated areas, like the UAVs spotted in Paris this week. In an interview this week with French daily Le Figaro, Christophe Naudin, an aerial security specialist, said the drones seen this week seemed to be flying simultaneously, suggesting a coordinated operation and, in his view, ""excluding the possibility of a prank."" Naudin hypothesizes that the operators are part of a ""well-structured organization"" looking to ""test the intelligence capabilities"" of the French government. While the motives behind this week's spate of UAV sightings remain a mystery, it is clear that drones have become increasingly popular among amateur aviators. FNAC, the country's leading electronics retailer, described drones as ""le hit"" of the holiday shopping season last year. Christian Sanz, founder and CEO of the San Francisco-based commercial UAV maker Skycatch, told The Verge that we're likely to see even more rogue flyovers as drones become more mainstream, forcing governments and businesses to develop new technologies and stronger regulatory systems. ""Eventually, the consumer industry, in conjunction with lawmakers, will implement a system for detection of drones and their owners, and ensure a safe and secure technology for bringing unauthorized UAVs down,"" Sanz said in an email Wednesday. ""Until then, you can expect to see more people pushing the boundaries, so long as they can't be detected.""",0.5318213014015345,0.4681786985984655,0.8748757622599886,836,5.4688995215311005,468,6.615384615384615,0,0,"Policy & Law, Tech, US & World, Report",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

And, followed to its logical conclusion, this will do long-term damage to the FCC as well.

Read the full letter to FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler from 21 Republican members of the House   Read Verizon's full statement Today, the FCC voted 3-2 to adopt new Open Internet rules – rules that we support and agree should be put in place as legally enforceable by the FCC.  Unfortunately, the FCC also decided to reclassify broadband as a telecommunications service under Title II of the Communications Act of 1934.  We are disappointed the Commission chose this route, which is certain to lead to years of litigation and regulatory uncertainty and may greatly harm investment and innovation, when the use of Section 706 alone would have provided a much more certain and legally sustainable path. We fully embrace the open Internet principles that have been laid out by President Obama and Chairman Wheeler and that now have been adopted by the FCC.  We just don’t believe statutory provisions designed for the telephone industry and adopted when Franklin D. Roosevelt was president should be stretched to govern the 21st century Internet. [...] After today, the only ""certainty"" in the Open Internet space is that we all face inevitable litigation and years of regulatory uncertainty challenging an Order that puts in place rules that most of us agree with.  We believe that the best way to avoid this would be for Congress to act.  We are confident this can be done in a bi-partisan manner with a consensus approach that accomplishes the common goals of stakeholders on all sides of the open Internet debate without the unnecessary focus on legal jurisdiction and the unnecessary regulatory overhang from 80 year-old language and provisions that were never intended to be applied to the Internet. Read Comcast's full statement This is a an enormous victory. This is the culmination of years of hard work by countless Americans who believe — just as I do — that the internet should remain the free and open platform that it’s always been.  Net neutrality is important for consumers, for small businesses and startups trying to compete with the big guys, and ultimately, for the innovation that has helped drive our economy for the past several decades. [...] I’m thrilled that the FCC has taken this crucial step. But the fight isn’t over as some Republicans are already working on legislation to undo all of this. So in the weeks and months ahead, I will continue to make sure everyone understands what’s at stake, and why we need to stand by the strong rules adopted by the FCC. But in the meantime, let’s celebrate. A free Internet with equal access for all is vital to a diverse and vibrant culture of open exchange. We're grateful that the FCC has heard the millions of voices who believe in a free and open internet. Today's step is a huge victory, however, we must remain diligent in protecting everyone's rights as citizens of the web. The net neutrality debate is about who picks winners and losers online: Internet service providers or consumers. Today, the FCC settled it:  Consumers win. Today’s order is a meaningful step towards ensuring ISPs cannot shift bad conduct upstream to where they interconnect with content providers like Netflix. Net neutrality rules are only as strong as their weakest link, and it’s incumbent on the FCC to ensure these interconnection points aren’t used to end-run the principles of an open Internet. Given the lack of competition among broadband providers, today’s other FCC decision preventing regulations that thwart local investment in new broadband infrastructure also is an important step toward ensuring greater consumer choice. These actions kick off a new era that puts the consumer, not litigious corporate giants, at the center of competition policy. Our narrow focus throughout the network neutrality debate has been to ensure that the rules do not thwart efforts to prevent copyright infringement, or otherwise chill production and distribution of innovative content. Until we see the order we cannot know for sure, but the FCC has previously indicated that it would continue to make clear that the rules do not apply to unlawful transmission of content, and would refrain from regulating parties on the edge of the Internet, such as content creators. Internet should be free & open, not regulated by federal bureaucrats. My stmt: http://t.co/zBP2TekxXL #OpenInternet #NetNeutrality  We applaud the FCC’s decision to preserve the fundamentally open nature of the Internet and look forward to reading the Order and rules. Today's FCC vote was a momentous one for everybody on the internet, and we couldn't be more pleased with its outcome. The majority of commissioners followed Chairman Wheeler's lead and made the brave decision to leave the internet in the hands of those who actually use it—the innovators, the entrepreneurs, and the everyday users—rather than allow it to be controlled by broadband carriers. We're also incredibly proud of the Tumblr community. When we gave them the opportunity to make their voices heard, they responded loud and clear, and their policymakers listened to what they had to say. We owe them our gratitude for helping enshrine a free, fair, and open internet for generations to come. With years of uncertainty and unintended consequences ahead of us, it falls to Congress to step in. Working together, our legislative leaders can protect an open Internet, while ensuring that it remains free for innovation without government permission and that it continues to create strong incentives to deploying ever-faster broadband to every American. The FCC has taken us in a distressing direction. We must now look to other branches of government for a more balanced resolution. Broadband for America: Today, in a partisan 3-2 vote, the FCC has abandoned over 15 years of successful bipartisan policy that, by nearly everyone's acknowledgement, has worked exceedingly well.  The result?  Years of legal uncertainty that will chill investment and innovation in the most successful sector of our economy while likely raising new taxes and fees on middle class families.

By protecting the open Internet from big cable companies that want to limit access, this victory levels the playing field for consumers, small businesses, and Main Street. We are grateful for the leadership of FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler and the FCC commissioners who voted for this plan in the face of powerful interests; for President Obama, who backed the net's roots at a pivotal time in this fight; and for the millions of Americans who spoke out powerfully and organized on this issue. Read MoveOn's full statement Partial victory: FCC votes for bright line rules protecting #netneutrality, but we're still worried about the general conduct rule.  The FCC’s Net Neutrality decision was disappointing and unnecessary: consumers across the U.S. have – and will always have – access to an open mobile Internet. By ignoring the fundamental differences in wireless networks and disregarding the intense competition throughout the mobile ecosystem, the FCC abandoned a long-standing policy framework responsible for fostering America’s world-leading wireless industry. The FCC's claim that the mobile voice experience supports the FCC's efforts distorts history and the law, turning a deregulatory statute in 1993 on its head. Title II needlessly puts at risk our nation’s 5G future and the promise of a more connected life. Read the CTIA's full statement Today’s vote by the FCC reclassifying broadband as a Title II public utility service takes us in the wrong direction on the information superhighway. CEA supports a light regulatory regime that strikes the appropriate balance among fostering innovation, promoting competition and maintaining broad access to and across the Internet.  With this vote, the Commission has instead placed regulatory shackles and new legal risks on the Internet and those who use this technological marvel to create critical new services, products and jobs. The end result for consumers: less choice, higher costs and reduced innovation. Read the Consumer Electronics Association's full statement What is remarkable is that the commission’s overreach is so unnecessary. Broadband service providers are operating in complete conformance with the open Internet standards advanced by the president, we agree with the standards, we support their adoption in regulation by the FCC under Section 706, and we support their enactment into law. We will now turn to the courts for review, and given the broad consensus that exists on the underlying objectives, will look forward to working with the Congress on a bipartisan basis to advance legislation. Read USTelecom's full statement The uncertainty created by the FCC’s plan will jeopardize the fast pace of private sector investment and improvements.  In addition to having an immediate impact on investment, the FCC’s plan is a Trojan Horse. If Title II is not struck down by the courts, a new Administration or new Commissioners could push the FCC to implement the full, heavy-handed regulatory authority it provides. [...] We are confident that Title II regulation will be rejected as Congress, the courts and consumers fully understand how it will hold back investment, innovation and growth. While we support the coming legal challenges, our plan is to work with Congress to find a reasonable, balanced approach to an open Internet.

The millions of people flooding the FCC's servers with comments have been so effective that Republicans have actually changed their broad policy position to prohibit fast lanes after years of saying they were fine. In fact, a Republican bill in Congress right now lays out almost exactly the same net neutrality plan the FCC just voted on. The only difference is that Obama wants to implement those rules under the authority of Title II, while the Republicans would just pass their bill. That's not stopping Fox News from you know, being Fox News. Its headline today? ""FCC approves sweeping Internet regulation plan, Obama accused of meddling."" Sure. It's not really that sweeping, but it is regulation, and Commissioners Pai and O'Rielly certainly accused Obama of meddling. It's a sort-of-fair headline, even if the ""meddling"" came after intense pressure from the public. Then there's this lede: The Federal Communications Commission on Thursday adopted sweeping new regulations sought by President Obama for how Americans use and do business on the Internet, in a party-line vote that is sure to be challenged by the broadband industry. Well, Obama and the 4 million people who crashed the FCC's computers with comments about net neutrality. And I have no idea what ""how Americans use and do business on the internet"" means; the rules are meant to keep service providers from interfering with that. But still: it sounds like Obama is going to screw with people. It's Fox News. They hate Obama. Got it. Let me ask you something. What the hell does Fox News think this even means? But the rules, more broadly, would put the Internet in the same regulatory camp as the telephone by classifying it like a public utility, meaning providers like Comcast or Verizon would have to act in the ""public interest"" when providing a mobile connection to your home or phone. Lest you think this was just a mistake, the same piece doubles down later on: That would dramatically expand regulators' power over the industry by requiring providers to act in the public's interest and enabling the FCC to fine companies found to be employing ""unreasonable"" business practices. (I love the ""unreasonable"" in quotes. ""Unreasonable."" No internet provider has ever been unreasonable!) Like I said, net neutrality has traditionally resisted being politicized like this — people love the internet more than they love their political parties, and these are the rules that make sense. But man, that doesn't mean the right-wing media machine isn't going to try. It's going to get weird.

There are times when the gauzy lens of nostalgia distorts how we think about movies, music, and TV shows of years past, tricking us into thinking they're better than they were — and then there are times when we're presented with cold, hard facts that things simply were better. Take, for example, the state of summer movies in 1985. The Houston Chronicle's Bayou City History blog posted a listing of movie times for the July 4th weekend 30 years ago, and it's basically a line-up of some of the decade's best movies. On that fateful weekend, you could head to the air conditioned confines of a theater to watch a new release called Back to the Future, and follow it up with The Goonies. Or maybe you wanted to see a double feature of Cocoon followed by Fletch. If you were in the mood for something more mature, there was Jack Nicholson and Kathleen Turner in Prizzi's Honor, as well as St. Elmo's Fire and Clint Eastwood's Pale Rider.  On the action front, Roger Moore's James Bond was facing off against Christopher Walken in A View to a Kill, and both Schwarzenegger and Stallone provided options with Red Sonja and Rambo: First Blood Part II, respectively.  It's 1985 and it's the July 4th weekend. What are we gonna see? And where? pic.twitter.com/vRd7Yj0Y0T What do the multiplex options look like in 2015? Well, there's new releases Magic Mike XXL (intriguing) and Terminator Genisys (hrrrm). There are holdovers — and money printing machines — Inside Out (emotions!), Jurassic World (ehhhh), and the Melissa McCarthy vehicle Spy. And then it's just padded out by a bunch of movies people are already forgetting exist (San Andreas, Ted 2), with every other free screen devoted to additional showings of those two new releases.  A snapshot of how movies have changed When compared against the 1985 listings, it's a snapshot of how the industry has changed: no mid-range movies, no extended theatrical releases where something like Fletch can linger despite middling box office, no room for more mature fare amidst the superheroes and broad comedies. That's not to say there aren't good films made today — Inside Out and Max Max: Fury Road are just two examples from this summer — but as a whole, it's hard to not yearn for the summers of decades past.

The 2004 Dreamworks take on Daniel Handler's (pen name Lemony Snicket) cult classic series about the harrowing lives of the three Baudelaire orphans could have been great — dark, smart, funny — but was mostly just weird and hurried, and paid far too much attention to its poorly cast leads (Jude Law as Snicket, and Jim Carrey as the villainous Count Olaf). The film also covered material from only the first three books, and seemed to promise sequels that never materialized on the big screen. But Netflix announced in November that the series would indeed be coming back: the company was developing a television adaptation under its ""Original Series"" banner, with far more participation from Handler than the film received. This trailer was uploaded yesterday morning to a YouTube account registered to ""Eleanora Poe,"" the editor of a fictitious newspaper called the The Daily Punctilio, who notoriously fires Snicket (the series' narrator) for writing a bad review of a play penned by one of the series' many dozen bad guys. Updated 7/6/15 11:37 AM: A representative from Netflix told EW that the company was not responsible for the teaser trailer. Regardless, it looks great, and certainly renewed the buzz, which has understandably died down in the eight months we've gone without an announcement of any details. Here are the book references we spotted in the gorgeous, albeit fake, teaser:   The first three seconds are pretty much a vintage Fallout 4 trailer, but it only goes up from there.   These grubby dishes are coated in some kind of pasta — presumably the pasta puttanesca that the Baudelaire orphans are forced to cook for Count Olaf in the first book, The Bad Beginning.   This little guy is obviously a leech from Lake Lachrymose, the setting of the third book, The Wide Window.   Here we have Klaus Baudelaire's glasses, as well as a book on arson, which is the felony of choice for villains and conflicted heroes alike throughout the series. The book on the top of the pile also sports the symbol for the secret organization, VFD. ""Starting fires"" and ""putting out fires"" are going to be important shorthand for the factions within that group, but the books don't delve much into its history until book 12, The Penultimate Peril.   The ""Lucky Smells Lumber Mill"" needlepoint, as well as The Paltryville Constitution pictured here are props from book four, The Miserable Mill, while the stuffed crow is almost definitely a call-out to book seven, The Vile Village, which takes place in a town overrun by the foreboding birds.   Mushroom Minutiae is pulled directly from book 11, The Grim Grotto, in which the Baudelaire orphans consult a mysteriously authored text on mushrooms and fungus in order to save themselves from some nasty lung spores. Also pictured: a bellhop hat from the Hotel Denouement, the setting of book 12, The Penultimate Peril.    This shot is all book one, featuring Violet Baudelaire's marriage certificate, the book on nuptial law that she used to nullify it, and her signature hair ribbon. But the cameo locket also looks strikingly similar to the cover of Handler's supplementary book, The Beatrice Letters, which has direct relevance only to book 13, The End.  The trailer ends with a shot of a typewriter (which we can only hope and pray will not be operated by Jude Law this time around) and the Netflix logo, the main reason that the internet thought this teaser was all but confirmed as real. Alas, this is just another unfortunate event.   The intended audience for this show, in Handler's own words: ""A family with children of assorted ages ranging from first grade to graduate school. They make popcorn and pull out the sofa bed and lounge around watching something interesting on television. They have some flecks of Japanese seaweed that they sprinkle on their popcorn.""

No matter how absurd the premise (emotions are a crime!) or obvious the criticism (colonialism is bad!), there's usually something well intentioned beneath their hammy monologues and over-the-top action sequences. By that metric, the trailer for Self/less (directed by Tarsem Singh, still best known for The Cell,) seemed to promise a winning combination: perennial action hero Ryan Reynolds, wielding a flamethrower against a creepy scientist who helps the rich consume the poor. But no matter how many cars are crashed and bullets are fired in the name of class consciousness, the ultimate takeaway of Self/less is that immortal billionaires are as dull as everyone else. Warning: Spoilers ahead.   Damian Hale (Sir Ben Kingsley) is a New York developer so rich that he lives in a gold-filigreed penthouse with a gigantic marble fountain casually installed behind the sofa. He enjoys ruining the lives of over-ambitious young competitors, dislikes historical preservation laws, and tries to buy his daughter's affection by simultaneously funding and insulting her housing nonprofit. In short, he's a ruthless businessman who has more lust for power than for life. But after being diagnosed with terminal cancer, he seeks out a procedure called ""shedding,"" in which aging moguls can secretly have their minds transplanted into idealized vat-grown bodies. The hidden catch should be blindingly obvious: this isn't an artificial shell, it's a man (Ryan Reynolds) who agreed to have his mind wiped in exchange for a badly needed payout to his family. Albright (Matthew Goode), the mysterious scientist behind shedding, frames it in explicitly elitist terms: Phoenix Biogenic doesn't just save the wealthy, they save the wealthy and worthy, who will use their second life to advance human achievement. It's transhumanism by way of Objectivism, a system where proles voluntarily sell their bodies so that more useful people — those whose talent has naturally brought them riches — can extract the maximum value from them. It's also a classic genre convention. The hyper-wealthy are most darkly attractive in pulp when they're a little bit like vampires, callous sophisticates using the brute power of their money to sap energy from the young, vital, and poor. Albright embodies chilly scientific detachment and suave persuasion, or at least, he's supposed to. Kingsley's Damian is selfish and manipulative, the kind of person you believe would sacrifice someone else's life to save his own. We don’t spend much time getting to know pre-transition Damian, but from the moment he wakes up in Ryan Reynolds’ body, he drops almost all of Kingsley’s mannerisms and apparently spends several weeks playing pickup basketball and bringing home generically sexy one-night stands from generically cool nightclubs. Movies like Society, a far better and creepier film about class, have fun with the idea that the wealthy are idle and decadent, but Damian's post-transition hedonism belies an embarrassingly bourgeois common denominator, pulled straight from a PG-13 spring break dramedy. Reynolds doesn't play Damian as a continuation of a specific character so much as a bland amalgamation of thriller protagonists. We only spend a short amount of time with Kingsley's Damian, but we know enough to make it hard to believe that he would suddenly embark on an altruistic, high-stakes quest when he learns the truth about his body. (Damian's host is apparently also a super-soldier, which raises some questions about whether ""body donor for fictional Robert Moses"" was really his best income option in a pinch.) When the body's original personality starts to surface, the only difference is his shooting prowess. The film starts with a well-trod but pointed trolley problem — the cold calculation of what a human being is worth. If, as Albright suggests, you could give the world's greatest thinkers another half-decade of life, would any of them try to morally justify killing to get it? Would we trade a human life for another world-changing piece of tech from Steve Jobs? But the film quickly abandons this line of questioning. Shedding, it turns out, is just a sinister retirement package. Sometimes a movie can be so bad it becomes almost subversive. To its credit, Self/less takes the fictional cliché of deliberately cruel class oppression, and paints it as something more like extreme naïveté or willful blindness — something closer to reality, in other words. At one point, Damian wonders why a revolutionary anti-aging technology is secretly sequestered in a random warehouse, but the whole system only seems feasible if every one of Phoenix Biogenic's privileged clients is willing to avoid asking some extremely obvious questions. There's nothing sexy or alluring about people who use their privilege to invade and occupy someone else's body, if, given the chance, all they really want is a Hollywood frat boy's idea of a good weekend. A movie about a man with a peanut allergy Subversive, however, doesn't necessarily mean clever or fun. Self/less is a movie about a man whose most defining characteristic is his peanut allergy, struggling with the memories of another man whose most defining characteristic is throwing incredibly loud punches. And both of those men are played by the same actor. And that actor plays them with roughly the same screen presence he displays as a corpse in a nutrient tube.

That's not quite the case. There are scientific and – more importantly — social reasons why this idea may not pan out. Electric vehicles are supposed to be the future of transportation, but they may have a competitor: hydrogen. Hydrogen fuel cells are beginning to gain traction, but they'll face similar hurdles to electric cars when it comes to getting them on the road and keeping their metaphorical tanks full. The US doesn't have a lot of options for getting into space, and with SpaceX's failure this week, it has even fewer. NASA may once again have to start looking to other countries — but there's still a chance the US can pull off the trip on its own. Vine is a fairly straightforward, streamlined take on video.

Across the state, her followers pelted buses with stones and set them on fire. At Perungalathur junction, on the highway to Chennai, people lay down in the road and tried to persuade bus drivers to turn the buses on them. ‘‘Run us over, run us over!’’ they yelled. ‘‘Why should we live when our Amma is in jail?’’ According to the A.I.A.D.M.K., hundreds of people committed suicide in response to her conviction, dozens by self-immolation.

You may not love all of them, but there's definitely some great stuff in the mix. You can see 11 of this week's best below.   Our first real look at Danny Boyle's Steve Jobs is a good one. This trailer is quick, tense, and filled with drama. It shows Jobs as a legend and a fraud, a hero and a scumbag. And there's all of the Sorkin quips you could ask for. It's out October 9th.   Michael B. Jordan looks amazing here. In fact, the entire cast looks amazing. If you weren't feeling the idea of a Rocky spinoff, don't worry. Just click play, and see how great this looks. Creed seems to be building out a compelling new character to carry on the Rocky franchise, so much so that Rocky himself feels more like a bonus than the hook. It'll be out November 25th.   With a cast like this, the long-hoped-for Wet Hot American Summer prequel pretty much has to be funny. And our first real look at it — the trailer above — makes it pretty clear that it is. Take a couple minutes and catch up with some of the best comedians around. The eight-episode series arrives on Netflix July 31st.   Sometimes Netflix has wildly popular or groundbreaking shows like House of Cards and Orange is the New Black. And sometimes it has BoJack Horseman. The eccentric animated comedy is coming back for a second season, and a full trailer for it came out this week. The full thing premieres on Netflix July 17th.   I don't know enough about Dragon Ball Z to give this its proper due, so here's Kwame Opam on Resurrection 'F': In the follow-up to last year’s Dragon Ball Z movie, Resurrection 'F' features the return of beloved villain Frieza. After being wished back with the Dragon Balls, Frieza comes to Earth to challenge — who else? — Goku to a duel he probably can’t win. Watch out for lots of transformations that are probably more ridiculous than Super Saiyan 3 in a movie no one really asked for. Oh well.   The Diary of a Teenage Girl clearly fits the definition of ""quirky indie film,"" but it also looks like it puts those quirks to very good use. It's stylish, it's funny, and it seems to be a smart take on a teenage girl's coming of age. It'll be out starting August 7th.   Breathe received some wonderful reviews out of Cannes last year, and now it's finally headed to the US. The film deals with a friendship between two girls, one turning passionate and the other becoming something of a bully. It'll be out on September 11th.   Ethan Hawke, Emily Mortimer, punk rock, and teens? Sure, I'll bite. The film is about drug issues, growing up, and the straight-edge scene in 1980s New York. It's a coming of age film, but certainly one a bit different from, say, Paper Towns. It'll be out August 14th.   I don't entirely know what's going on here, but it all seems pretty tense. Tom at the Farm is a thriller about a guy who heads to his boyfriend's funeral only to find that the family knows nothing of him. From there, some crazy psychological thriller stuff goes down. It'll be out August 14th.   Some of the greatest comedians around get on camera to talk about another all-time great: Chris Farley. That should make I Am Chris Farley a compelling look back at the comedian's life and career. It'll be out in theaters and on-demand August 11th.   Tig's first trailer makes it out to be a powerful look at comedian Tig Notaro's battle with cancer. It's also pretty hilarious, which should be no surprise if you're familiar with Notaro.

Yes, you could have probably said that every year since the dawn of the smartphone — that’s just the way technology works — but this year there’s been an explosion of activity in the world of unlocked, carrier-free smartphones in the US. You no longer have to settle for sub-par hardware when trying to save a few bucks. Companies such as OnePlus, Acer, Alcatel OneTouch, and others have announced phones that can go toe-to-toe with the best from Samsung in terms of performance, but costs hundreds of dollars less than a comparably equipped S6.Of course, if you’re a company that’s playing in this space, all this competition makes it that much harder to stand out from the pack. You can’t just slap together a bunch of high-end specs, put an aggressive price tag on it, and hope that people will come running. Now, perhaps more than ever, a great smartphone not only checks off the tick boxes for functionality, it also has other, intangible qualities that make it desirable. Maybe it’s an exotic design, maybe it’s the ability to customize the look and finish, maybe it’s super premium materials that are a step above what’s par for the course. Whatever it is, it’s not something you can get from slapping a smartphone together from a parts bin.ZTE’s new Axon Pro does the check list thing right. It hits most, if not all, of the functionality and components that make a great smartphone today. It has an all-metal chassis, the latest high-end processor from Qualcomm, a super-high-resolution display, and a high-resolution camera. It runs the latest version of Android and works with both AT&T and T-Mobile’s LTE networks (but not Verizon or Sprint). You can buy it unlocked for $449, much less than a comparable iPhone or flagship Samsung Galaxy smartphone. That price also includes a two-year warranty that covers any problem or accidental damage, including liquid damage or broken screens. On paper, the Axon Pro is really attractive, and the price is low enough to turn heads. But in practice, as I’ve experienced over the past few weeks of using it, the Axon Pro lacks the intangible je ne sais quoi that separates the great smartphones from the also rans. It’s largely just fine, which isn’t really a bad thing, but isn’t enough to stand out in an incredibly crowded field. My problems with the Axon Pro start with the design, but don’t end there. It’s nice that it’s made of metal, but unlike the unibody metal phones from Apple or HTC, the Axon Pro is very obviously bolted together from separate pieces and isn’t nearly as sleek. It looks a bit like an HTC phone from 2011, before the company really tightened up its manufacturing tolerances. The Axon Pro is solidly put together — at no time did I feel like it was going to fall apart — but it doesn’t turn any heads in 2015. The 5.5-inch, Quad HD display is sharp and bright, though the phone’s automatic brightness adjustment can make it too dim to see comfortably at times. But aside from that minor quibble, it’s a fine screen that does its job as you’d expect it to. There are some nice features in the Axon’s hardware: it has a front-facing speaker (yes, just one, despite the dual-grille design), a home key that doubles as a notification LED, and a dedicated camera key. Sadly, and a bit confusingly, the camera key doesn’t actually launch the camera app, and it doesn’t have two stages for focus and capture. The camera itself is a 13-megapixel unit with a secondary sensor for blur effects after the shot is taken. It’s not the most impressive camera, with flat contrast and drab colors in low light, and the blur effects are just as gimmicky here as they were when HTC debuted them in 2014’s One M8. The camera is the most obvious point where the Axon’s lower cost holds it back — it just can’t hold a candle to the cameras on the Galaxy S6 or LG G4. But the Axon Pro can hold its own when it comes to performance and stamina. The Snapdragon 810 processor and 4GB of RAM perform flawlessly, and the phone never gets bogged down or feels laggy. Likewise, the 3,000mAh battery had no trouble lasting an entire day with room to spare. ZTE has also included fast charging in the Axon Pro, so it only takes 30 minutes to go from 0 to 50 percent charge. Wireless charging would have been a nice addition, but with quick charging this rapid, I’m not missing it much. I do wish the Axon Pro had an option for more than just the 32GB of built-in storage or the ability to support microSD cards. Both of those are things that enthusiasts look for, and 32GB is quickly becoming a bare minimum. For software, the Axon Pro runs Android 5.1.1 Lollipop, with some slight customizations by ZTE. The modifications aren’t drastic, but there are some odd choices within them that make me wonder why ZTE bothered. The lock screen doesn’t display as many notifications as stock Android does, and the notification panel has been slightly altered in ways that aren’t necessarily any better than what Google does. Google Now is hidden behind a long-press of the home key, but if you swipe up on that you get an odd dashboard of recent contacts, your activity tracking, and random sports news from Yahoo. Most of these things are minor quibbles, but for the people that would be interested in the Axon Pro, I can see them rapidly getting annoying. And that puts a nice pin on my struggles with the Axon Pro: I just can’t tell who it’s for. It’s loaded with high-end specs that would appeal to enthusiasts, but it’s not as aggressively priced nor as nicely designed as the OnePlus 2, which has similar hardware. It doesn’t have the cool customizability or great software features of the Moto X Style, which also undercuts it in price. And it can’t compete with the cameras and design of the Galaxy S6 or LG G4. It sits in this weird middle area in terms of price and functionality without really standing out in any way. A year or two ago, ZTE could have played this game with ease, but at this point, the pack is just getting too crowded for the Axon Pro to stand out.",0.48132612797173124,0.5186738720282688,0.1531689827885484,1100,4.6872727272727275,559,5.8586762075134171,0,8,"Google, Mobile, Tech, Review",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

""They want to be able to say what's on their mind and be themselves."" After neglecting the feature for years, Twitter began rolling out improvements to direct messages when Kevin Weil took over the product organization last fall. The company restored the ability to send links, added group and photo messaging, and began letting you share tweets natively inside the messages. The idea, Agarwal says, is to make DMs the place where you talk about the stuff you see on Twitter. ""We want to make sure you can really fluidly move between public and private,"" he says. Among other things, removing the 140-character cap on messages make it easier for businesses to conduct customer service over DMs. ""We want to make sure you can really fluidly move between public and private."" Over the years, Twitter has explored releasing a stand-alone messaging app built on DMs, a la Facebook Messenger. I asked Agarwal how he thought about that question today. He wouldn't say anything about unreleased products, but suggested DMs functioned best as a kind of backchannel for Twitter: a place to take discussion of tweets, or the people tweeting them, to a private place. I wonder if that isn't thinking too small. Twitter's asynchronous nature has made it a place where people often meet new friends, business contacts, even romantic partners. A lightweight messenger app could open up new possibilities for the company, just as it has for Facebook and the Asian mega-messengers. Perhaps that will come down the road.

The finding provides a case study of how diseases jump between species and has raised concerns about the role viruses play in extinction threats. Canine distemper virus, a relative of measles,  was once thought not to cause disease in cats — until outbreaks among zoo animals in the 1990s suggested otherwise. Once scientists were alerted to the danger, they began studying wild lions for signs of CDV as well. In 1994, approximately 30 percent of Serengeti lions died from an epidemic of CDV, researchers found. Earlier studies suggested that domestic dogs living in areas surrounding the Tanzanian national park were responsible for the continued presence of the disease, but now it appears that CDV has mutated and evolved to thrive in other carnivores, according to a study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. In 1994, a CDV epidemic killed approximately 30 percent of Serengeti lions A major way diseases mutate is by jumping between species, though. Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome, Ebola, and the H1N1 swine flu all jumped from animal to animal before crossing into humans. MERS is a bat virus that established a hold in camel populations; humans in close contact with camels were most likely to get sick. Ebola, which originated in fruit bats, jumped into other species of great apes before coming to humans. And a variant of swine flu — which as the name suggests, is ordinarily found in pigs — jumped to humans, causing a pandemic in 2009. Now that CDV has switched hosts from dogs to lions, scientists are concerned about potential threats to other wildlife, researchers write in today's paper. ""Our study raises questions about which other carnivores in the Serengeti might be transmitting the virus between dogs and lions,"" says Tiziana Lembo, veterinary scientist at the University of Glasgow's Boyd Orr Centre for Population and Ecosystem Health. Lembo is one of the study's authors. ""We need to consider how to broaden our strategies to control this disease."" Though domestic dogs are likely the original culprit in spreading CDV to other species —  a major spike in dog infections was followed by an initial major spike in lion infections — over time, dogs played less of a part in the virus spread. Using decades of data collected from both the Serengeti lion and domestic dog population, researchers determined that the frequency of infection in lions has increased while the overall frequency in domestic dogs has decreased. Peak CDV infections in lions are no longer in sync with peak infections in the dog population, the study finds. ""We need to consider how to broaden our strategies to control this disease."" In response to the 1994 epidemic, vaccination programs for CDV were established for domestic dogs. While that's been effective in reducing infection in the dog population, the disease continues to spread in lions. Studies on CDV infection in Russia's endangered Siberian tiger population have revealed similar patterns in interspecies adaptation. The next question is to study what other animals are now carriers — particularly worrisome are roving animals, like hyenas, who can spread CDV more widely. Trying to keep endangered species from dying off entirely is a tricky business. Today's study shows how encounters between our domesticated animals and wildlife can be unexpectedly dangerous for the wildlife. Knowing more about how viruses adapt to new hosts may help protect lions and other threatened animals. And given how often human infectious diseases start in animals, keeping track of how viruses jump species may help us monitor future threats to our own health.

But today, Facebook's AI research lab (FAIR for short) is releasing new code for optimizing a certain kind of machine learning software. The new process can speed up machine learning algorithms as much as 23 times, according to Facebook's research, and as of this morning, it will be available for anyone who wants to use it. This probably won’t matter much for large labs at Google or Microsoft — but it may boost smaller apps or database projects that lack the resources or a larger company. The difference between a pipe dream and a feasible feature The code is specifically useful for convolutional neural nets, a kind of algorithm commonly used in image and video recognition. Facebook's new code would allow the same processing work to be done significantly faster or cheaper than previously available code: if sorting a given batch of images took a dollar’s worth of server time previously, the new code could perform it for less than 5 cents. For a startup trying to spot objects or faces in photos and videos, that could mean the difference between a pipe dream and a feasible feature. Still, experts say the real significance isn't the research itself, but the open approach Facebook is taking to its research. ""Whenever you're dealing with a for-profit lab, whether it's Google or Facebook, the question is to what extent will they be part of the academic community and, you know, play nice with others,"" says Oren Etzioni, CEO of the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence. ""With this, they're putting a stake in the ground and saying, we are going to be part of the community."" Facebook founded its AI lab in 2013 with NYU's Yann LeCun, part of a larger movement that pulled machine-learning academics into the private sector. (Stanford's Andrew Ng took a similar post at the Google Brain project.) That's taken much of the cutting edge of artificial intelligence work out of the public sphere, as breakthroughs that would once be published in journals threaten to become trade secrets. ""The purpose for Facebook is to facilitate communication between people, and that requires a pretty good model of what people want,"" LeCun told The Verge in 2013.

Not only are they linked through shared genes, the genetic mutations associated with them also work together to govern immunity, brain signaling, and genome function later in life, according to a Nature Neuroscience study. The new finding may mean that only one drug will be required to treat all these disorders in the future. These psychiatric disorders share more than individual genes This is the first study to show the genetic overlap between psychiatric disorders leads to meaningful paths for treatment, says Peter Holmans, a biostatistician at King's College London and a co-author the study. Essentially, it translates the genetic information into a roadmap for drug discovery. Approximately 50 percent of adults in the US will develop a mental illness in their lifetime, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and depression will affect about 1 percent, 4 percent, and 17 percent of adults in the US, respectively, over the course of their life — and these disorders can be costly to treat. Most people diagnosed with mental illness are either poorly treated or untreated, according to a study of US mental health services published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. Overall, the cost of mental illness in the US amounts to $300 billion a year for treatment, lost wages, and disability benefits. Drug discovery for many of these disorders has essentially stalled out; today's finding may lead to new approaches that could ultimately benefit patients. Because this is the first study to demonstrate the mechanistic relationship between these disorders, more research needs to take place to characterize how psychiatric illness functions in the body, Holmans says. He hopes his results will encourage the field to look at biological pathways, which are sets of genes that work together to carry out essential processes in the body. ""They're likely to be  more promising druggable targets than individual genes,"" he says. In the study, Holmans and his team of researchers analyzed 60,000 people — 33,000 of whom had diagnosed psychiatric disorders and 28,000 of whom didn't. The participants' genomes allowed researchers to examine the genes that act together along pathways in the body. By comparing the two groups, the researchers aimed to find out if certain pathways have a higher proportion of genetic mutations relevant to psychiatric illness. They then ranked the pathways by their contribution to disease risk for each illness, including depression, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder. Eventually, they were able to use those rankings to find out which pathways are most relevant across multiple disorders, instead of in individual illnesses. The researchers demonstrated that many of the genetic variants that have already been shown to increase the lifetime risk of developing a mental illness work in clusters, playing majors roles in immunity, brain signaling, and genome function later in life. ""That’s the very novel thing that we are showing,"" Holmans says. Not only do these disorders share genetic mutations in common, he says, but the mutations actually cluster together to carry out essential processes in the body. The findings may bolster the 2010 move by the National Institutes of Mental Health to develop clinically useful measures based on genetics and  neuroscience. ""Future studies of psychiatric illness should perhaps be  based on the actual symptoms observed in the patients rather than the  traditional [diagnostic] criteria,"" Holmans says, especially since many symptoms overlap among illnesses, and people can develop one set of  symptoms and not the other. The next step is to see if clusters of symptoms from psychiatric disorders match certain pathways in the body, Holmans says. Such an analysis might lead to developing drugs that target specific symptoms present in more than one disorder. It might even lead to a drug that decreases a person's likelihood of developing one of these disorders in the first place — although that application seems speculative at the moment. The study may also help shift doctors from illness categories to symptomatic diagnosis Of course, genetics aren't the whole story. A person's lived experience also plays a role in the risk of developing serious mental illness. Still, Holmans says, genetic factors are ""pretty important."" Finding a way to regulate these pathways might not prevent everyone who's at risk from developing a mental disorder, but it may one day give at-risk people better chances of avoiding mental illness, or of making their mental illness less severe.",0.7151040512464684,0.28489594875353164,0.8668031531667032,762,5.3622047244094491,378,6.3650793650793647,0,0,"Science, Report",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

New devices meant for general wellness may have an easier time getting to market, if current regulations holdFor the FDA's purposes, a general wellness device is something that encourages weight management, physical fitness, relaxation or stress management, self-esteem, and sleep management. As long as these don't make claims about specific diseases — for instance, as long as a fitness tracker doesn't say it can diagnose or fix obesity — the agency will use a light hand, particularly if there aren't serious side-effects to the device's use. Most consumer devices fall into this category, as do many of the wellness products that we saw at CES: myBrain's Melomind, Healbe's GoBe, and Garmin's VivoFit, among others. And new devices meant to measure things like blood pressure may have an easier time getting to market, if the current recommendations hold. But the ruling also opens doors for devices of questionable accuracy and value, since the agency won't be closely tracking general wellness claims. So a device that claims to count steps or calories may not be held to high standards of accuracy, the way other kinds of medical devices are. These guidance documents don't establish legally enforceable policy.  Rather, they tend to describe the FDA's thinking on a certain subject.  Now that the guidance has been posted, there is a 90-day comment period  before the recommendations are finalized.",0.39353442394036614,0.6064655760596338,0.1873910297828587,323,5.4210526315789478,204,6.1715686274509807,0,0,"Policy & Law, Science, US & World",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

To the political world, the mission is an unimaginative boondoggle short on vision. The Orion capsule has been successfully tested. It’s the first crewed craft since the Apollo era with deep space — rather than low Earth orbit — as the primary focus. The eventual goal of the Orion program is a crewed mission to Mars. But to do that, NASA wants to test the technologies necessary for making that next step. The mission is to capture an asteroid and reposition it into a stable orbit around the Moon. From there, astronauts would land on the tiny, rocky body — the first time humans will land on another non-Earth part of our solar system since the Apollo program ended in 1972 with Apollo 17. NASA is excited at the prospects of the mission, with a return to human spaceflight and a way to lay the groundwork for Mars or the greater solar system. ""This will be farther than humans have ever gone before from Earth. 71,433 km beyond the Moon,"" says Michele Gates, program director of the Asteroid Redirect Mission. ""It will be the first time we do sampling with crews from one of these primitive bodies from the early solar system.""   But the enthusiasm for the mission is less palpable in Congress, where Republicans hate it and Democrats have yet to find a vocal champion for it. To congressional Republicans, the fundamental problem is that the mission’s not to the Moon. When the Asteroid Retrieval Mission came up in 2013, they rejected it. Instead, they wanted moon orbits and moon bases. ""It is the policy of the United States that the development of capabilities and technologies necessary for human missions to lunar orbit, the surface of the Moon, the surface of Mars, and beyond shall be the goals of the administration’s human spaceflight program,"" an authorization draft said. There’s an odd alliance when it comes to the Republicans in Congress and NASA. Rep. John Culberson (R-TX) allies himself with the Tea Party — a group best known for denying anthropogenic climate change and, at times, even evolution itself. But they are often supporters of NASA missions because launch complexes, NASA contractors, test facilities, and other related space enterprises are based in their districts. Culberson, who authored a bill amendment attempting to prevent the EPA from enforcing carbon standards, is a forceful champion of a Europa mission, one of the few mission outlines specifically called for in the Cromnibus bill passed last year. The latest round of budget negotiations contained surprisingly little language related to the Asteroid Redirect Mission. The agency in general saw a higher-than-expected windfall. Right now, the main focus of mission-specific funding seems to be a probe to Europa, Jupiter’s icy moon which harbors a subterranean ocean. $100 million of the $18 billion allotted to NASA in the Cromnibus bill has been directed specifically to Europa. Additionally, $2.9 billion will go toward human spaceflight missions, including the Orion capsule and the Space Launch System, with no specific targets laid out in the bill language. This is particularly good for ARM, as it doesn’t set a moon base as a first priority, or explicitly target one mission for promotion or demotion. The Orion capsule is largely expected to ferry astronauts to the near-Earth asteroid destination.   It was a rare reprieve for the Asteroid Redirect Mission, which may not be as lucky in the near future. In 2013, House Republicans went after the proposed mission with specific language in a draft of the bill: ""The Administrator shall not fund the development of an asteroid redirect mission to send a robotic spacecraft to a near-Earth asteroid for rendezvous, redirect and redirection of that asteroid to lunar orbit for exploration by astronauts."" The draft didn’t pass, and there’s since been little direct talk in budget negotiations specifically regarding the mission. So little, in fact, that seemingly no one wants to talk much about the proposed mission in Congress — including calls to more than a few House offices, where the proposal has been especially contentious. But public statements show something between ambivalence and hostility, without an outright champion for the proposal in Congress. Culberson, is the incoming chairman of the Commerce, Justice, and Science Subcommittee, is no great fan of the plan, saying, ""I don’t think pushing a rock around space is a productive use of their time and scarce resources,"" in an interview with the Houston Chronicle. Culberson’s office was unavailable for an interview after initial contact with his press secretary.   Then there’s Sen. Ted Cruz, Texas’ firebrand with high aspirations, an ultra-conservative playbook and eyes on the White House. He also happens to oversee NASA now, thanks to a prime spot as chair of the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation, which has authority over NASA. Cruz, a skeptic of anthropogenic climate change, may target NASA atmospheric studies with his newly emboldened platform. He’s said surprisingly little about the Asteroid Redirect Mission. But NASA is busy winnowing down its list of candidate missions and hoping to launch in the next few years. As it heats up and becomes closer to a reality, the opposition may heat up once again. With a conservative caucus emboldened by recent elections, a mission like the Asteroid Retrieval Mission could fall under the umbrella of dozens of other ""wasteful NASA projects"" stripped of federal funding, like SETI, the later Apollo missions, and a combined asteroid fly-by / Rosetta-like cometary probe. With a Congress that will hold the federal budget up to a microscope, a mission like the Asteroid Retrieval Mission — not seen as audacious and inspiring by congressional Republicans — might not survive.   Some in Congress, like Steven Pallazo, an Alabama Republican and the chair of the Space Subcommittee, want to return to the Moon. The Obama administration has instead aimed for new kinds of exploration, including of near-Earth objects. But the problem with an asteroid mission is a quieter narrative, one the administration hopes it can bring people around to. ""We’re opening up the solar system; asteroids are one part of a broader exploration strategy,"" says a White House official who worked on technology issues for the administration and asked to not be identified. ""I think the one thing everyone does agree on is Mars is the ultimate goal."" With Mars in mind, the administration sees the Asteroid Redirect Mission as a stepping stone. Mars is the ultimate goal, after all — it’s continuously outlined in space exploration circles on either side of the aisle. When President George W. Bush introduced the Constellation plan in 2005, it included a return to the Moon. Like the Asteroid Redirect Mission, the ultimate goal was Mars. President Obama largely gutted the plan in 2010, with the Orion capsule standing as one of the few survivors. ""We think of the ARM mission as preparing for Mars,"" Gates says, adding that the first Orion flight was able to test the capabilities needed for the Asteroid Redirect Mission to be successful.     The Asteroid Redirect Mission would likely use the Orion capsule, which underwent a successful test flight on December 5th. It would also be a proving ground for the Space Launch System, a heavy lift rocket that will be used for further deep space exploration. While the Republicans want the moon, the Obama administration wants the Asteroid Redirect Mission as a cheaper alternative and a way to test technologies. ""NASA is 20 pounds of mission in a 10-pound budget bag,"" the official says. ""We’re trying to have it on a sustainable path, invest in the enabling technologies and hardware like rockets and capsules and solar electric propulsion to open up all kinds of locations."" Orion and SLS both have a lot of proposed funding going into next year. But the Asteroid Redirect Mission has no such love. Cruz will be taking over chairmanship of Commerce, Science, and Transportation from Sen. Bill Nelson (D-FL), who is the only person currently in Congress to have been to space as a payload specialist — non-astronaut members of crews often outside the day-to-day NASA operations. Nelson is one of the few vocal champions of the mission, calling it a ""clever concept."" It seems that most of the criticism comes from Republicans, but Democratic endorsements are at times half-hearted or not easily won. Rep. Donna Edwards (D-MD), who sits on the Space subcommittee, was initially skeptical of the mission, but turned around toward endorsement, saying she was ""mesmerized"" by NASA admin Charles Bolden’s description of the mission. Edwards’ office declined to comment for this article. It seems the champions of the mission are the administration and NASA itself. But without further interference in the 114th Congress, the Asteroid Redirect Mission will move forward on track. It even struggles for respect in some quarters of the scientific community. Prof. Richard Binzel, a professor of planetary sciences at MIT, is a fierce opponent of the mission as it stands, hoping NASA will instead put its resources toward a wide cataloging of near-Earth objects. Putting an asteroid in orbit around the Moon, to him, is a costly way to ""remain in the Earth-Moon cradle,"" and one he sees little future in. Instead, he says, a wider survey of near-Earth objects may yield an inexpensive destination, finding bigger and better objects without having to develop the technology to lasso them in. He says that while the ARM would grab one object, ""a survey will deliver you thousands at a fraction of the cost."" ""Capturing an asteroid has nothing to do with going to Mars."" He is skeptical of it as a stepping stone to Mars. ""Capturing an asteroid has nothing to do with going to Mars,"" he says of the administration’s goal with the mission. ""There’s nothing about going to an asteroid that involves going to Mars."" On Tuesday, NASA will decide which way they want to go with the Asteroid Redirect Mission, choosing whether they’ll break off a piece of a larger object and place it into a Lagrangian orbit, or whether they’ll scope out a near-Earth object of a smaller size. Once it’s decided, they’ll be able to start planning more mission specifics and developing the technologies, like harnesses, solar electric propulsion, and other advances needed to make it a success. ""We need the technologies for highly efficient, sustainable human exploration approaches for mars, where we use solar-electric propulsion to carry cargo and use chemical or other high thrust propulsion for crews,"" Gates said.   The newly minted Congress could spell continued troubles for the mission, which has struggled to gain a foothold in public approval. The high profile priorities may be in Culberson’s dreams of a Europa mission. Worse things could happen. The ARM could prove a wedge tool to pick apart the funding allocated to NASA. While Republicans like Culberson may be keen on seeing a Europa mission, other costly projects might not survive. If 2013 committee meetings repeat themselves as well, the Asteroid Redirect Mission could end up a scapegoat for the Obama administration’s space policy. Earth and climate sciences may be in the scopes of politicians like Cruz, but a big wedge like the ARM could well carry over into the new congress. After all, it sets the tone for future endeavors at NASA, especially in crewed exploration. To a group that hardly finds it inspiring and wants to scrutinize government spending, they may use it as a way to put the focus back on the Moon — contrary to the administration’s goals. Correction: This article initially said the mission would be the first craft since the Apollo era in deep space. In fact, it is the first human-crewed craft; it also misspelled Charles Bolden's name.

It's a show about Hollywood movies, blockbuster video games, and basically anything with the slightest whiff of geek appeal. Yet each year, independent artists and publishers still descend on the convention looking to find an audience. But is that even possible when all their would-be customers are stuck waiting overnight in the Star Wars line? While the internet gives indies a way to be discovered, many still live and die by the convention circuit. The Devastator, an independent comedy publisher based in Los Angeles, says that around 70 percent of its revenue comes from conventions, even though it also sells books online and in around 40 stores. ""That's about average for every indie press we know,"" says Amanda Meadows, one of The Devastator's founders. Many publishers still live and die by the convention circuit And with conventions going more mainstream, that could present a problem. The Devastator, like the other small publishers here, are selling a niche, geeky product: most of its books are parodies of properties like Goosebumps, Dungeons & Dragons, and MegaMan — the kind of products that rely on people with very specific interests finding and falling in love with them. And bringing those books to Comic-Con in hope of finding an audience isn't cheap. A booth can cost a small publisher around $3,000, which may mean making hundreds of sales before turning a profit. Meadows has been bringing The Devastator to Comic-Con for several years now, and she says that she's seen some change as the show's focus continues to shift from comics to huge films and video games. A bigger show means more people who can potentially find her booth, but now, Meadows says, ""You have to go through so many people to find the right people."" Plus, getting in is expensive and a huge commitment for would-be attendees. ""The young hipsters with not a lot of funds can't step in to find the weird stuff,"" she says. And yet, Meadows and other independent artists and publishers at Comic-Con don't seem to mind the changing interests and audience. ""I don't see it as a negative,"" says Yehudi Mercado, the artist behind SuperMercado comics. A few years back, ""People were mad because Glee was here,"" he says, shrugging off the concern. ""Some Glee fans will like something I do, I'm sure."" ""Comic-Cons were the first way we got the word out."" The independent artists and publishers making it at cons are taking different approaches to success, but the general consensus is that they just need to be aware of the Con's audience. Mercado isn't selling only his comics — which includes a graphic novel about a pizza delivery boy — he's also selling small prints featuring his takes on famous characters, something that the discerning fan might want to pick up even if they aren't ready to buy a full book. Immediate sales aren't the only benefit of showing up at a con either. Artists and publishers see it as a way of slowly building an audience. Even if someone doesn't stop by their booth this year, they might recognize it the next year and finally take the time to check it out. ""Comic-Cons were the first way we got the word out,"" Meadows says. The show is also a place to build connections with other artists and publishers. The entire industry descends here — it's an obvious place to do some networking. Part of it, Mercado says, is being able to ""walk away from a convention with gigs,"" like being hired to do cover art for another publisher's comic. Lonnie Millsap, a webcomic artist who's been posting single panel jokes since 2009, says he'd rather walk out of Comic-Con having met someone who can help him sell several hundred more comics next year than move a few more units at this year's show. ""There's no expectation that we're gonna be the next Warner Brothers,"" he says. ""Being in the small press section at Comic-Con validates what I do."" In fact, these independent publishers and artists aren't even able to make a full-time job out of it yet. Meadows says that she and another founder of The Devastator are both only ""80 percent full time."" Millsap has a management job, and Mercado is the art manager for Disney's Playmation. Still, there's an emotional component to being here. ""Being in the small press section at Comic-Con sort of validates what I do,"" he says. And it allows him to actually meet the people who are buying his books, something that Millsap says he's taken a surprising satisfaction in. Meadows says the same is true of those running The Devastator, that part of being there is for the existing fans. ""Enough fans would be disappointed if we weren't [at Comic-Con]."" Those familiar faces may become few and far between as Comic-Con's focus grows and it becomes harder for all audiences to show up, but that growth is still bringing in people who love geek culture and are looking for something new. ""It widens the audience,"" Mercado says. ""That's the best thing. That's better for everybody."" And really, it's not like there are many geeky publishers that would want to skip Comic-Con, anyway. ""You can't not do this show,"" Meadows says. ""It's Mecca, right? Everything's here.""",0.49854204361981,0.50145795638019,0.21458481650942887,901,4.8490566037735849,467,5.6788008565310495,1,0,"Comic-Con, Culture, Entertainment, Comics, Report",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Owners of football teams currently in St. Louis, San Diego, and Oakland are angling to make a move to Los Angeles, and they're leveraging the potential departure locally for taxpayer support of new or improved stadiums in their current municipalities. As Oliver makes clear, this strategy often leads to the comically vile scenario in which billionaires demand that cities provide hundreds of millions of dollars to appease privately owned teams that charge many of those same taxpayers hundreds of dollars for tickets. Oliver briefly touches on the extravagances of taxpayer-funded stadiums, present and future, including the mega-fishtank installed in the Miami Marlins' stadium and the yet-to-be invented, but contractually mandated holographic replay machine the Cincinnati Bengals may use its county's money to install. AT&T Stadium, home of the Dallas Cowboys, is my pick for most cynical public spending. $325 million of the $1.3 billion stadium cost came from taxpayers' money. Arlington mayor Dr. Robert Cluck had to negotiate to receive some of the naming rights for the stadium, which now rewards the city $500,000 a year. That might sound like a lot, until you realize it would take 650 years without interest for the naming rights to reimburse the taxpayers. But here's the real kicker, courtesy of Bloomberg: New York Giants fans will cheer on their team against the Dallas Cowboys at tonight's National Football League opener in New Jersey. At tax time, they'll help pay for the opponents' $1.2 billion home field in Texas.That's because the 80,000-seat Cowboys Stadium was built partly using tax-free borrowing by the City of Arlington. The resulting subsidy comes out of the pockets of every American taxpayer, including Giants fans. The money doesn't go directly to the Cowboys' billionaire owner Jerry Jones. Rather, it lowers the cost of financing, giving his team the highest revenue in the NFL and making it the league's most-valuable franchise. According to Forbes, Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones' net worth is $4.2 billion.",0.5717220603707829,0.4282779396292171,0.8965086841611788,353,5.3116147308781869,247,6.1214574898785425,0,0,,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Hoo boy. Let's get to it. Comic-Con, as you know by now, is a game of winners and losers. Friday brought us a transcendent Star Wars concert; Saturday was highlighted by Channing Tatum shooting a superhero selfie at the Marvel panel. Sunday has a reputation for bringing on the dregs of the convention, but this year it was also where a lot of hotly anticipated TV shows made their debut, from consistent fan favorites like the CW's Supernatural to newcomers like FX's Scream Queens. Let's see what we can do with these humble Sunday offerings and tabulate our final round of winners and losers.  LOSS: It's barely been five years since Tim Kring's overstuffed Heroes limped off the air. In the time since, the show's creators apparently watched a lot of X-Men movies and wondered why they couldn't make a primetime TV show out of them. The result is Heroes Reborn, which imagines a world in which ""evos"" (mutants) are hunted by ""the government"" (the government) and must band together to stop the murdering. The trailer that NBC screened in Hall H suggested most of Heroes' worst tendencies are still intact: introducing a bewildering array of new characters every few seconds; padding out the run time with gobs of empty foreboding; and remaining totally loyal to its overwrought yet thuddingly dull mythology. Heroes Reborn was weirdly ubiquitous at Comic-Con this year — ads ran on the sides of shuttles around town, and a giant activation in the Gaslamp Quarter drew more than 1,000 fans to trudge through a 2-minute interactive movie. Meanwhile, the show is now available as — yes! — an app. But the thrill is gone, and it ain't coming back. These heroes don't look reborn, they look regurgitated. WIN: The secret energy source of Comic-Con for the past decade may well be The CW's The Vampire Diaries, which always seems to generate an outsize amount of enthusiasm here relative to its modest ratings. On the brink of its seventh season, the show was finally promoted from smaller ballrooms to Hall H, where star Ian Somerhalder dropped a bombshell: the ""sexy, volatile, fun, dangerous"" Damon we ""fell in love with in season one"" is returning in season seven. Fully processing the implications of this return to form likely require watching the first six seasons, which we haven't gotten around to yet. But if there's one thing this day needed, it was the volatile sexiness that the Phineas and Ferb panel utterly failed to deliver.   And now, we look back and determine the win and loss that defined Comic Con 2015:   Every year San Diego insists that Comic-Con hasn't outgrown its host city. And every year Comic-Con proves it wrong: despite the incremental improvements it makes to line management and bathroom maintenance, the growing mainstream popularity of genre fiction overwhelms it at every turn. An expansion plan now underway feels like too little, too late, and it's a shame. Fans deserve better than 17-hour line waits amongst mice and cockroaches. They deserve larger venues, added hotel capacity, and street vendors selling food and beverages to make all that line-waiting a little more bearable. In other words, fans deserve Los Angeles, and while we can understand why its current host would be sad to let the Con go, San Diego has an increasingly hard time making the case that the city still deserves it. #sdcc #sdcc2015 End of the con. #cosplay #madmax #madmaxfuryroad #furiosa #nux #immortanjoe A photo posted by Grayson (@capitainegrayson) on Jul 12, 2015 at 6:38pm PDT    WIN: A big shoutout to every single person who cosplayed at Comic-Con this year. In two years of attendance I've still never seen a bad cosplay here, and many are jaw-droppingly good. In a place where so much of the enthusiasm feels manufactured, it's the handmade costumes that tether fandom to reality. To the Raiden with blinking neon electric arms; to the Batgirl in a wheelchair; to the note-perfect Admiral Ackbar standing outside the show floor yelling, ""It's a trap!""; to everyone who walked in — you are the beating heart of this festival and the source of all that is good about it.   Star Wars: The Force Awakens may be the year's most anticipated movie, and with Comic-Con being a haven for Star Wars fans, the show was J.J. Abrams' to lose. But rather than phone it in, Abrams and co. went overboard on fan service. The actors who play Luke, Leia, and Han Solo reunited on stage, and a charming behind-the-scenes video stoked fans' anticipation. By the time a legion of Stormtroopers led more than 6,000 people to a nearby venue to hear the San Diego Symphony play music from Star Wars, the winner of Comic-Con 2015 was as clear as the fireworks over San Diego. In a year where Comic-Con treated fans more like cattle than ever before, it fell to Star Wars to make something enormous feel intimate and personal once again. Here's hoping that feeling remains when the The Force Awakens hits theaters in December.",0.5110936243431603,0.4889063756568397,0.16324116418933035,901,4.8024417314095453,536,5.9496268656716422,0,4,"Comic-Con, Culture, Entertainment, TV",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

This is how the journal Computers and Automation introduced its January 1963 cover: a black-and-red mountain range of a waveform created by junior MIT technician Ebram Arazi. This piece of ""electronic surrealism,"" as the editors described it, wasn't just a departure from the magazine's traditional covers (smartly dressed engineers grinning over desk-sized computer banks), it was also one of the earliest documented examples of computer art ever, and the editors were so taken with it, that in February of the same year, they introduced an annual competition. It was ""the first of its kind,"" writes art historian Grant D. Taylor in his book When the Machine Made Art, and the journal had a ""crucial role in connecting the growing number of interested technologists and artists."" In any given issue, Computers and Automation devoted equal time to the latest methods of database storage and grand questions about the future of their ""great instrument,"" but the Computer Art Contest was soon a regular event. A look back through old issues of the journal (available at Internet Archive) shows how the fledgling discipline of computer art rapidly evolved. At the time, computers were specialized tools, most commonly used by individuals working in research labs, academia, or the military — and this heritage shows. Both the first and second prizes for the inaugural 1963 competition went to designs generated at the same military lab. One of these is a ""Splatter Pattern"" printed at the United States Army Ballistic Research Laboratories (BRL) — the institute responsible for creating a number of revolutionary devices including the world's first electric general-purpose computer, ENIAC. Although the Computers and Automation editorial announcing ""Splatter Pattern"" as the winner of its first competition is light on details, the name of the piece suggests its origins in ballistic calculations. Another design from the BRL that won the magazine's competition the following year ""shows trajectories of a ricocheting projectile (ranges vs. altitude)."" The US military, it seems, didn't just have a hand in kickstarting the computer industry — they also helped shape its early artistic instincts.  The ricocheting projectile design by an anonymous programmer featured on the cover of the August 1964 issue of Computers and Automation (Internet Archive) Although many computer designs featured in Computers and Automation's contests focus on abstract and repeating geometric shapes (presumably due to the technical limitations and intended use of software at the time), there is a sense of expanding purpose as computers are turned to new tasks. An issue from February 1965 features a report on computer-designed space ships created by Boeing, and by the time we get to the sixth annual computer art contest there are portraits of John F. Kennedy and Abraham Lincoln alongside abstract designs of wreathes, whirlpools, and rings. By 1975, the computer art has even moved into the physical world, with the year's April issue featuring the sculptural work of Spanish artist Jose Luis Alexanco on its cover. Alexanco coded his own computer programs to morph and stretch humanoid figures and then modeled them in resin. It's not clear whether the physical sculpture featured on the cover was itself created by a computer or just the design, but the object looks strangely similar to 3D-printed artwork created today. Looking through past competitions offers more than a few comparable instances of déjà vu, with programmer-artists grappling not only with similar methods of artistic creation (e.g. producing shapes and patterns by tweaking mathematical equations), but also similar critical concepts. An editorial note from 1967 declares that as outside galleries begin to exhibit computer art, ""a turning point... has been reached"" and computers will soon be used in a wide variety of artistic disciplines, from photography and painting, to sculpture and music. Computers and Automation editor Edmund Berkeley even wonders: ""Will the human being be superseded?"" Eventually, though, he concludes that this could never happen, as no matter how much art is created by computers, it is human beings that control them and make ""the decision about what is beautiful."" We wonder if he would have been so confident today. ""Stained Glass Window,"" anonymous. Computers and Automation, August 1963. ""Silk Patterns,"" Maughan S. Mason.

McKenna helped design every pixel in the app, from its vibrant color palette to its rich paper-like icons. McKenna has a style that is uniquely his own, and which has inspired a new wave of mobile apps and sites that embrace flatness without eschewing character or depth. He took a few minutes to talk to The Verge about building Vine’s dead-simple capture screen, why establishing constraints make for great design, and Nickelodeon’s cartoon Doug. You can find him on Twitter at @bobby, and on Dribbble here.  Where are you right now? I am sitting in a leather recliner in my hovel of an apartment, trying to ignore the leaky faucet in the bathroom, and half paying attention to SportsCenter. Three hairless cats are curled up at my feet. I’m wearing a quinceañera dress. How did you end up at Vine? Rus Yusupov (Vine co-founder and creative director) and I have worked together off and on for two or three years now. I did a bunch of illustrations and stuff for his old shop, Commercial Pop, back when I lived in Philly. When he started Big Human (a product design studio that lives one floor below Vine), he asked me to design the identity. A few months later I moved to New York, and Rus asked if I’d be interested in spending some time as a freelance art director at Big Human… or if I’d rather work on this thing called Vine.  Having never worked on anything digital, I was excited for the opportunity and a little worried that I’d blow it. But I knew that if I wanted to live with myself, I had to say yes. So I said yes. And then a bunch of other stuff happened, and now I’m doing an interview with The Verge. What tools do you come back to, again and again, both analog and digital? All the standard digital stuff — Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, and InDesign. I actually use Adobe Bridge, which a lot of designers think is bad, but they’re wrong. It’s not bad. It’s good. ""I don’t get too wrapped up in expensive pens or notebooks with weird European nonsense grids."" On the analog side of things, I don’t get too wrapped up in expensive pens or notebooks with weird European nonsense grids. Just whatever writing instrument and scrap of paper is nearby. Actually, I don’t think I’ve bought a pen or pencil since like eighth grade. Not sure where this cup full of pens and pencils on my desk came from. Starting to feel kind of nervous about it. What’s your process like for designing? Do you tend to over-design and then pull back, or do you keep things light from the get-go? I tend to spend about 50 percent of my allotted time sweating and worrying about the thing I have to make, 30 percent nervously puking it out onto the screen, and 20 percent trying to arrange the puke into something that looks not terrible. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn’t.  Whether you’re designing a logo, app, icon, or book cover, are there any basic processes or rules you adhere to? I’d love to be one of those guys with a really methodical Process With A Capital P, but my brain just refuses to operate that way. Those guys seem so confident and relaxed. Not me. I’m a wreck when I’m working, especially if it’s on something I care about. ""If you give me a blank canvas and tell me to make whatever I want, I will lose my mind."" The only consistent element of my ""process"" is my need for constraints. If you give me a blank canvas and tell me to make whatever I want, I will lose my mind. So even when I get a brief that’s like, ""Hey, we trust you. Just make something cool,"" I have to tie one hand behind my back before I can really get started. You’re big into GIFs and pictograms. What can you do with a GIF that you can’t do with other mediums? It’s certainly easier to be funny or absurd when you can make a picture move and loop. Looping can take a mediocre joke and make it hilarious just through sheer force of repetition. It always reminds me of that old Simpsons bit with Sideshow Bob and the rakes. Man… what if there were an app that did like, GIF, but with sound. Somebody should make that. On my (desperately in need of an update) personal website, I use obnoxious GIFs to weed out people I don’t want to work with. Kind of like psychedelic concert posters from the ‘70s — if you can’t read this crazy lettering, you probably shouldn’t come to the show.  What design element, big or small, in the Vine app are you most proud of? Stripping the capture screen down to its most essential elements was a very satisfying process, and I think the resulting design has enhanced the experience of recording a video on Vine. It’s just you and the thing you’re making. No extraneous bullshit. I’m also very proud of the intentional misspelling of the ""wierd"" channel. What was your favorite cartoon growing up, and why? I really liked Doug. It’s a show about a normal kid in a town full of weirdos, which is kind of how I’ve felt ever since I moved to New York. How would you describe your visual aesthetic as a designer? When Vine launched it felt very on-the-ball visually, and now many apps and sites are using similar designs. I’d like to think that I always provide the appropriate solution to a problem. But the truth is, for better or worse, every designer has little tics and tendencies — moves you can fall back on when nothing else is working. My inclination is always to use as few parts as possible to build a machine that works. And if I can make that machine sort of silly and not too self-important, that’s a huge bonus. I like design that winks at its audience. I think my work does a pretty good job of that, Vine included. Vine for iPhone screenshotsPreviousNextView full GalleryPreviousNext  ""My inclination is always to use as few parts as possible to build a machine that works."" Which artists have inspired your work most? Any particular pieces that have really informed what you do? No single piece of art has ever stuck with me quite like Codex Seraphinianus, by Luigi Serafini. It’s this surreal visual encyclopedia of an alternate universe with its own culture and logic and science. It’s disturbing and funny, often at the same time, and I hope to one day be so disgustingly, unfairly wealthy that I won’t feel bad about spending $2,000 on a copy of a weird book. In your Bucket List (on your website), we noticed that you would someday like to design a cover for Time magazine. What makes a good magazine cover? Not sure why I said Time. I guess it seemed like a sort of iconic thing to work on when I was writing that list. But pretty much anything Bloomberg Businessweek does falls into the category of ""good magazine cover."" While every other magazine on the rack is screaming, ""PICK ME UP I WILL TEACH YOU HOW TO DO SEX AND HAVE ABS OH AND ALSO TERRORISTS ARE TRYING TO POISON YOUR CHILDREN,"" Businessweek is just whispering, like, ""Yo dude, check out this quietly genius insight that we’ve expressed through a visual medium,"" and you’re like, ""Okay, I will spend $5 on you.""

This is the key complaint that's led designers like Tony Fadell to rethink the humble thermostat and smoke detector, and now it appears Dyson is tackling the hair dryer. The appliances grew in popularity in the 1920s, and the basic design has changed little since then. According to a new Dyson patent application uncovered by The Telegraph, the company behind bagless vacuum cleaners and more efficient blow dryers thinks it can improve the design. It seems the company is focusing on quieting down hair dryers by lengthening the path of air through the appliance. The patent filing explains that ""the noise of the hair dryer is reduced by having a long fluid flow path; a coiled, looped, curved, s-shaped, zigzagged fluid flow path."" New materials could also be used to dampen the sound. A cross section of a hypothetical Dyson hair dryer included in the filing is not necessarily indicative of what the final product will look like, but it does show one concept for how to extend the airway. Air passes in through the back of the dryer and is routed through a maze of ducting before passing around the handle and back through the main tube.  The filing is based on fluid dynamics, and it notes that ""as less fluid is drawn in, the motor of the fan assembly can be smaller and lighter in weight, the noise produced by the fan assembly can be reduced as there is less flow thorough the fan, this can result in a smaller and more compact hair dryer which uses less power.""

Over the course of two months, the idea became a prototype called Chop-Syc, which aims to simplify healthy eating by providing easy cooking instructions and calculating portion control.  The chopping board runs unique software designed to specifically help with the cooking process. After a user selects a recipe, the ingredient amounts automatically adjust to match the number of people dining.

""We didn't expect to be in business for more than a year,"" says Karp. Today, the gallery is more popular than ever, with two locations in LA and shows in New York City, and it just launched its second book based on the Crazy 4 Cult series. It features fantastic pieces inspired by everything from Alien and Donnie Darko to Little Shop of Horrors and Pee-Wee's Big Adventure. ""I think our generation, both the artists and the buyers, aren't solely influenced by the masters like Picasso and Degas,"" explains Karp. ""Now they're influenced by Nintendo and Bill Murray movies."" By focusing on those influences, Gallery1988 has inspired an incredible amount of creativity from a diverse range of artists. And in the gallery space, it's a vein of creativity that was previously untapped. Karp notes that in the past, many artists were actively discouraged from using pop culture icons in their work. ""We were like, 'Please do that!'"" he explains. ""We knew that if we just stayed on course, people would learn about it and be drawn to it just like we were."" Crazy 4 Cult is the gallery's biggest show, and it first kicked off in 2007. It features plenty of the usual suspects, and many artists seem drawn to the same films — the new book features numerous interpretations based on hits like Shaun of the Dead and Back to the Future, for instance. ""I'm never really surprised that the same few movies seem to pop up,"" says Karp. ""From our generation some movies are just seen as art, and most are by notable auteur directors who are almost painters themselves."" But it's also a cult show, so there are plenty of pieces inspired by somewhat surprising sources, whether it's Strange Brew or The Cable Guy. The show hasn't just caught the attention of fans and the art world, though, it's also attracting the actors and directors featured in Crazy 4 Cult exhibits. Seth Rogen wrote the foreword for the new book, and Karp recently got an email from Sylvester Stallone inquiring about a Rocky piece. Previous buyers have included J.J. Abrams, Kevin Smith, Joss Whedon, and Edgar Wright. ""Nothing beats the fact that a piece with Nic Cage riding a robot was given to Nic Cage as a gift,"" says Karp.

Jingyao's ""Marketplace Posters"" collection was produced as part of a Kickstarter project launched last week, and includes detailed, stylized renderings of the Raohe Night Market in Taipei, the Muara Kuin Floating Market in Indonesia, and Tokyo's Tsukiji Fish Market (pictured above). The China-born Jingyao takes about a month to create each work, after conducting thorough research on each locale. The idea, she says, is to capture the bustling energy and unique culture of each market in graphic detail. ""As designers, we are interested in the way that all the minute details of an environment add up to create a rich and lively atmosphere,"" reads a statement on the project's page.

ODLCO 's Lisa Smith tells Core77 that the project dates back to 2010, when she and fellow co-founder Caroline Linder travelled to the night markets of Taiwan. They initially planned to create illustrations for children, but soon realized that they would appeal to a much broader demographic. ""We like the 'Where's Waldo' feel of each scene, and wanted to encourage kids to appreciate observation as a way of 'reading' an environment,"" Smith said. ""As the drawings evolved, however, it was clear that they appealed to all age groups, so we aren't being specific about who or where it's for, and let the viewers decide."" ""We hope that people will look at markets with new eyes."" And although some may see hidden meaning in selling illustrated markets on a digital marketplace, Smith says the works weren't designed as a commentary on contemporary e-commerce or crowdfunding. ""We weren't so much interested in making a comment about the internet as we were intent on celebrating the vibrancy and humanity of public markets,"" she explains. ""We hope that people who encounter these prints will look at markets with new eyes, and see them as highly creative, entrepreneurial, and important social spaces for all members of society.""

They were working with shockingly different astrological energies — the stars had pre-wired the sires of sparks for a faulty relationship. During a recent party at a friend’s home, I ran across a book that shook me as if I were a Magic Eight Ball: Gary Goldschneider and Joost Eiffers’ epic tome, The Secret Language of Relationships. A follow-up to the duo’s astounding The Secret Language of Birthdays, the book assigns every birthday a unique astrological ""week"" (for some divine reason, there are only 48 categories) and creates a matrix of relationships, revealing the fault lines between romantic, creative, familial, and business rapports. Unmasking my friends’ relationships made for a fun, if very tense party game, but it also got me wondering. Tech is an industry plagued by disharmony. Could astrology help us understand tech’s greatest feuds, and maybe even help the feuders better understand themselves? I turned to The Verge’s science editor, Katie Drummond, for counsel. ""Definitely,"" Drummond whispered, as if in a celestial trance. ""Let’s make a Hackweek list."" If we seek harmony in an industry often marked by petty grievances and earthly trifles, we must look beyond the cloud — and look up towards the stars. These two just can't get along. After Apple won a mega legal victory over Samsung in 2012, the two companies returned to court earlier this year to bicker over who copied who in the process of making some phones and affiliated gadgetry. Apple (mostly) came out on top, but the discord didn't stop there: Samsung's lead attorney later described Apple as a ""jihadist"" and the two companies continue to file various pieces of legal paperwork with intentions and allegations that are largely indecipherable to the average person. Samsung was founded the ""Week of Spirit"" while Apple started bearing fruit on the ""Week of the Child."" As such, their relationship ""will revolve around an imaginative world that emphasizes physical grace, vivid fantasy and gentle idealism."" But there are also ""conflicting energies that must be addressed"" at play here. A marital merger is not recommended, but a friendship is written in the stars. ""Dreams can become realities,"" but the two companies should also stay on their own sides of the bed. Peter Thiel is the Bart Simpson to Eric Schmidt's Superintendent Chalmers: the former a pluckish, combative techno-Libertarian and the latter a digital dictator presiding over a pervasive techno-dystopian institution. Thiel, co-founder of PayPal, is seriously dismissive of Schmidt, the executive chairman of Google, and his rose-tinted vision of societal progress through programming. The two butted heads at Fortune’s Brainstorm Tech conference in Aspen, Colorado, two years ago. ""You do a fine job as Google's administrator of propaganda,"" Thiel said. ""Let's just say that everything you just said is not actually true,"" Schmidt shot back. No wonder Thiel and Schmidt can't kiss and make up: ""The Secret Language"" labels their astrological relationship as ""take no prisoners,"" symbolized by a disgruntled praying mantis. ""The challenge of this relationship will be to preserve a balance of power. Both partners consider themselves authorities on a variety of subjects, and may be extremely intolerant of other points of view,"" Goldschneider and Eiffers write. The dynamic is marked by rivalry, depression, and challenges. The text also offers sage advice for the unlikely couple: ""lighten up and have fun,"" and remember that ""acting silly isn’t shameful."" Other ""take no prisoners"" couples? Ethan Hawke and Uma Thurman. Fiery, but ultimately unmanageable. Nothing is as ugly as the fight over the Roku remote when Reed Hastings, CEO of Netflix, sits down for movie night with Jeff Bezos, CEO of Amazon. This past spring, Amazon announced it had signed a massive agreement that secured Amazon Prime Instant Video as the stomping grounds for some of HBO's most popular scripted shows, and managed to steal Fox's 24 away from Netflix. Meanwhile, Netflix continues to outshine its competitor with original programming like House of Cards and Orange is the New Black, while Amazon stumbles along with the likes of Alpha House. Hastings was born during ""the Week of Society,"" and Bezos during ""the Week of Dominance"" — a primetime recipe for disaster. Characterized as ""subversive,"" ""clashing,"" ""evasive,"" and ""antagonistic,"" this relationship is ""imbued with contrasts — its energy can shift from the known to the unknown, from the potential to the kinetic and, often, from the acceptable to the questionable."" The book suggests that this dynamic might be compatible for marriage, but for the time being Hastings and Bezos' relationship is stuck in arrested development. Lyft and Uber are both playing a game of one-upsmanship when it comes to customer service: Charge your phone? A bottle of water? A stick of gum? I got you, bro. But between the two companies boils a devilish cauldron of ill will, fueling a road rage unlike any other. The car ride rivals are poaching each other's drivers with the ruthlessness of endangered rhino hunters — in May, Lyft tried to entice drivers away from Uber with offers of free tacos and $500. Uber meanwhile, has been accused of jamming Lyft's systems by encouraging drivers to open the Lyft app, call for a ride, and quickly cancel. Lyft and Uber need to downshift and take a leisurely, top-down cruise along the Avenue of the Stars. Both companies were born under fortuitous signs — Lyft in ""the Week of Freedom,"" and Uber in the ""Week of System Builders"" — but their relationship is defined by a ""Need for Change."" It's likely that Uber will ""usually feel more secure in an ordered situation that is only altered when a change will increase efficiency"" while Lyft will probably ""prefer something looser, often changing things just because they enjoy it, and tire of stasis."" At best the relationship can be ""thoughtful""; at worst, it can be ""manipulative,"" ""anxious,"" and ""fearful."" A rivalry so profound, the eminent Aaron Sorkin sprinkled it with Hollywood dust and took it to the big screens. After filing several lawsuits alleging that Mark Zuckerberg stole their idea for an online social network, the Winklevoss brothers even considered taking their complaints to the Supreme Court. All three have now moved on — Zuckerberg to a quiet married life somewhere in California, and the Winklevoss to the stars, via recently purchased tickets aboard Virgin Galactic's SpaceShipTwo. Suddenly, it all makes sense. The Winklevoss were born in ""the Week of Exposure,"" our guidebook notes, and can find relationships with Zuckerberg's ilk — ""the Week of the Natural"" — to be ""tyrannical or insensitive to them."" This perhaps explains why Tyler and Cameron sought retribution in the multi-millions: their astrological rapport with Zuckerberg led them to feel profoundly wronged by his ways. But might collaboration be in the future? Those born in the Week of Exposure have such dynamic personalities that they can ""fascinate"" those born under Zuckerberg's celestial pattern, ""waking them up to their own fantasies and desires."" If we are to trust Nick Bilton's book Hatching Twitter, the feud between Dorsey and Williams started when the two both sought sole reign of Twitter for themselves. And when Williams demoted Dorsey and took over as CEO (which Dorsey told Vanity Fair was ""like getting punched in the stomach""), Dorsey refused to go down without more of a fight — he publicly cast himself as the service's inventor while privately working towards Williams' professional demise. It's a shame, because this one really could've worked. The rapport between Dorsey (born in ""Week of Prophecy"") and Williams (intriguingly, born in ""Week of the Child"") notes the potential for mutual attraction because the other ""mirrors themselves."" But Dorsey's astrological profile is marked by self-absorption and difficulty communicating with others, which Williams' likely struggled with: he needs someone with a ""positive outlook"" to mitigate his own ""dark side."" .feature-body .vox-feature-list .vox-feature-story {	width: 35%;}.feature-body hr:before {	display:none;}.feature-body .vox-feature-list h4 {	font-size: 30px;	line-height: 30px;	font-family: ff-din-web-condensed,helvetica,sans-serif;	font-weight: 700;	margin:0px;	padding:0px;}.feature-body .vox-feature-list h3 {	font-family: ff-din-web-condensed,helvetica,sans-serif;	font-size: 47px;	font-weight: 700;	text-align: center;	margin: 0 0 1em 0;	text-transform: uppercase;}.feature-body .vox-feature-list li {	background: #fff;	margin-bottom: 1.5em;	padding: 10px;	position: relative;	/* border: 1px solid #eee; */	box-shadow: 0px 0px 3px #eee;}&amp;lt;style&amp;gt;.feature-body .vox-feature-list .vox-feature-story {	width: 35%;}.feature-body hr:before {	display:none;}.feature-body .vox-feature-list h4 {	font-size: 30px;	line-height: 30px;	font-family: ff-din-web-condensed,helvetica,sans-serif;	font-weight: 700;	margin:0px;	padding:0px;}.feature-body .vox-feature-list h3 {	font-family: ff-din-web-condensed,helvetica,sans-serif;	font-size: 47px;	font-weight: 700;	text-align: center;	margin: 0 0 1em 0;	text-transform: uppercase;}.feature-body .vox-feature-list li {	background: #fff;	margin-bottom: 1.5em;	padding: 10px;	position: relative;	/* border: 1px solid #eee; */	box-shadow: 0px 0px 3px #eee;}.feature-body .vox-feature-list li h4:before {	background: #e22805;	content: counter(mylist,decimal);	counter-increment: mylist 1;	font-family: ff-din-web-condensed,helvetica,sans-serif;	font-size: 32px;	font-weight: 700;	left: 20px;	padding: 10px 20px 3px;	position: absolute;	text-align: center;	top: 0;	width: 40px;	-webkit-transition: all ease-in-out;	-webkit-transition-delay: 0.3s;	-moz-transition: all ease-in-out 0.3s;	-o-transition: all ease-in-out 0.3s;	transition: all ease-in-out 0.3s;	color: #fff;	display: none;}h1#stream_title {text-align: left;}h2.title1.badged {font-size: 1.3em;}.feature-body .vox-feature-list li h4:before {counter-increment: mylist 0;}",0.5169298813844758,0.4830701186155242,0.8347802477998525,1461,6.0547570157426422,820,7.373170731707317,0,0,,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

Comcast’s corporate headquarters, Comcast Center, is the tallest building in Philadelphia. It’s covered in mirrors, which makes it the perfect metaphor for the company, one former employee says; no matter where you go, the glare is in your eyes.  It seems a lot of people share that sentiment.  Comcast earned Consumerist’s “Worst Company in America” title twice, first in 2010 and again this year, 2014. It ranks at the very bottom of the American Consumer Satisfaction Index, underperforming even the rest of the cable industry, where “high prices, poor reliability, and declining customer service” are endemic.  In mid-July, AOL executive Ryan Block placed a call to Comcast customer service in an effort to cancel his service. What ensued was an 18-minute, Kafkaesque struggle with an overly persistent employee, which Block partially recorded and posted online. The recording went viral, and has now been listened to more than 5 million times. The interaction was covered by every major news network, immortalized in a New Yorker cartoon, and included in a David Letterman top 10 list (“Lesser-known Labors of Hercules”). “It hit the cultural zeitgeist something fierce,” Block says. “I guess it touched some kind of nerve. It was a keyed-up, aggressive version of a call I think most people have had.”  Thousands of Comcast customers across the country have experienced similar customer service nightmares when dealing with the company. Usually these involve multiple rounds of phone calls, missed technician appointments, and unexpected fees. In fact, forums like comcastmustdie.com and the Comcast section of Reddit have been created to give customers a dedicated space to vent.  Despite being reviled, Comcast is enormously successful. It’s the largest cable company in the US, the product of a deliberate, then aggressive, growth strategy that involved buying up short-lived companies from cable’s early days. Most recently, Comcast bought NBCUniversal as part of an effort to own more of the programming it serves, making it the largest media company in the world. It is also the 57th most profitable public company, ahead of Intel, Anheuser-Busch, and Goldman Sachs. For its next act, Comcast wants to acquire Time Warner Cable: America’s second-largest cable provider with a similarly poor reputation of tormenting its customers. Comcast says the merger will allow it to deliver more programming, faster internet, and other improvements for customers, while allowing the combined company to compete against new media challengers. ""We will continue to invest hundreds of millions of dollars in our network to continue to create innovative products and services for Comcast and Time Warner Cable customers,"" says D’Arcy Rudnay, Comcast’s head of communications. The company says Block’s call prompted a customer service review that resulted in real changes. Eleven employee-coaching courses that used to be optional are now mandatory, and Comcast is reviewing training materials for customer service and sales. The company also created a task force to revise ""the messages we use in emails or calls to customers, in our automated phone system and in other communications, to reinforce that the overall customer experience is our top priority."" But a majority of Americans still oppose the merger, according to a poll commissioned by the Consumers Union, which opposes the deal, fearing that a consolidated cable industry will lead to price hikes and less incentives to improve customer service. (Another poll commissioned by Reuters found almost exactly the same result.) Others worry that an all-powerful Comcast will speed up or slow down services like Netflix in order to prioritize its own content and maximize profits. The proposed merger is being reviewed by several regulatory bodies, including the Federal Communications Commission, Department of Justice, and New York’s Public Service Commission, in order to evaluate its impact on the public interest. There is a good chance the deal will be approved. So how disastrous would such a merger be? Comcast and Time Warner claim a merger won’t create a monopoly because they don’t currently compete anyway. In fact, no one in the cable industry competes — which is why most people only have one choice for cable. The cable industry’s spirit of cooperation is underscored in the ""divestiture"" section of the proposed merger, in which Comcast, Time Warner, and Charter Communications propose trading customers the way kids might trade baseball cards. The transaction involves some contortions. Time Warner will transfer 3 million customers to Charter, and Charter will transfer 1.6 million customers to Time Warner. Then, Comcast will transfer 2.5 million customers to a new, yet-to-be named, publicly traded company, referred to as ""SpinCo"" in filings. SpinCo will be 67 percent owned by Comcast shareholders, 33 percent owned by a Charter-owned holding company, and managed by Charter.     Map of Comcast, Time Warner Cable, and Charter coverage areas before and after the merger.  Under the proposed deal, 3 million Time Warner subscribers would go to Charter, 1.6 million Charter customers would go to Time Warner, and 2.5 million customers would go to a new company, referred to as SpinCo in filings, which would be owned 67 percent by Comcast shareholders and 33 percent by a Charter-owned holding company. In the end, a combined Comcast-Time Warner would have 30 million subscribers, while Charter would be the next-largest cable company with 8.2 million subscribers, including the ones it will manage through SpinCo.   Data on the divested subscribers is sourced from public filings. Coverage areas are based on broadband coverage areas from the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, cross-referenced with public filings, and are accurate to the nearest zip code. Comcast has not released the exact breakdown of subscribers included in the divestiture transaction. As a result, dots indicate which designated market area subscribers belong to, but do not indicate the number of subscribers included in the transaction.  Map by Ryan Mark.  The deal would double Charter’s subscriber base, while keeping Comcast’s market share under 30 percent in order to appeal to regulators. Everybody wins — except, maybe, the customer. While they don’t compete with each other, cable companies do face competition from satellite, DSL, and 3G and 4G wireless providers. Unfortunately for customers, those technologies are far inferior. Satellite television is unreliable in bad weather, and unavailable in areas blocked by trees or buildings. Meanwhile, existing DSL and wireless services are frustratingly slow for modern internet uses like streaming video, transferring files, and loading web applications for professionals. ""The other options are hardly worth the money,"" says Bonnie Smalley, who worked in customer service at Comcast and won an award for her work tweeting as @ComcastBonnie. She quit in 2011. ""Right now, [Comcast] has little incentive to provide you with decent service. Who are you going to run to when you disconnect your service? Nobody, and they know it."" In other countries, regulation has forced cable companies to compete with each other. In the early 2000s, France ordered state-owned monopoly France Telecom to lease the use of its network to competitors at regulated rates. This ""local loop unbundling"" supercharged competition. New companies entered the market by piggybacking on France Telecom’s network, then built their own. As a result, the French typically pay about a quarter of what Americans shell out for a  ""triple play"" phone, TV, and internet package, according to a 2012 book by the Pulitzer Prize-winning financial reporter David Cay Johnston. The US tried to implement similar unbundling regulations in the mid-’90s, but incumbent cable companies repeatedly challenged them in court, set prohibitively high prices for the use of their networks, and applied pressure on politicians. Eventually, government officials were forced to reverse the policy. Today, Comcast is the seventh-largest single source of lobbying dollars on Capitol Hill, spending $18.8 million to lobby Congress and federal agencies. The National Cable and Telecommunications Association, which spends $19.8 million, is the fifth. The cable industry has also had success lobbying on a local level, in order to prevent cities from building their own broadband networks that would compete with cable. In Comcasted, a book by Philadelphia Inquirer reporter Joseph DiStefano, an early cable investor describes how the Comcast founders achieved their success. ""They have minded their business exceptionally well,"" he says. ""Fundamentally, though, they are monopolists."" When Comcast was acquiring cable companies in the ’90s and early 2000s, their emphasis was on television. ""[Their philosophy was], ‘We’re a cable TV company, everything else is ancillary to cable TV,"" says a technician who worked at AT&T Broadband when it was bought by Comcast in 2002. When the first cable entrepreneurs were wiring cities, local governments typically granted a single franchise for each community, or divided the territory among a few companies. In Philadelphia in the late ’80s, for example, neighborhoods were divided up among four cable providers (Comcast had the Northeast). Because of infrastructure costs, and because some cities didn’t want to grant multiple franchises, each company stayed on its own turf. They competed for franchises, but once granted, the companies started looking for a new community that hadn’t been wired yet. Once every community was wired, cable companies still didn’t compete — instead, they opted to consolidate. As a result, most American cities are now served by only one cable company. Competition is further discouraged by a patchwork of local regulations that require permits and access to public rights of way. (Google declined to build out its fiber network in California, for example, because of complex environmental regulations.) Around the world, things are different. Unbundling policies, which required incumbents to lease their networks to competitors at fair prices, spurred competition in France, Japan, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, and the Netherlands. Unbundling isn’t a ""magic bullet,"" says the Open Technology Institute, which issued a report on telecom policies around the world. In the UK, the unbundling policy was ineffective until the government forced BT, the dominant cable provider, to create a separate unit dedicated to selling network access to BT and its competitors. But when combined with other measures such as price transparency, ""dig once"" policies that encourage planning for future infrastructure, and city-owned networks that can be leased to private companies, unbundling leads to lower prices and faster speeds. That’s no longer true. If current trends continue, internet will soon be the cable industry’s primary business. Comcast’s residential internet subscriptions now bring in half as much money as its TV subscriptions and could eclipse TV by 2015. Meanwhile, the cable industry just had its first (small) net loss in TV subscribers ever, which analysts attributed to customers watching shows online rather than on TV. The most vocal opposition to the Comcast-Time Warner deal therefore comes from internet advocates, who are worried about three things: persistently slow and expensive service across the United States; higher barriers to entry for new internet-based companies; and Comcast’s ability to control what customers see and do on the internet. In 2008, the FCC warned Comcast for blocking access to the file-sharing site BitTorrent, which is notorious for facilitating internet piracy but also has many legitimate uses. Meanwhile, Comcast’s size enables it to extract fees that smaller cable providers can’t; for example, Netflix now pays what it calls an ""arbitrary tax"" to ensure high quality for its video streams. Weakened net neutrality rules —which require that all content transmitted over the internet be treated equally — have broadband advocates worried about the power companies like Comcast wield. Under the terms of its merger with NBCUniversal, Comcast is prohibited from blocking websites or selectively slowing traffic until 2018. But the company hasn’t said what will happen after that. And unless the FCC writes new rules, there will be nothing to stop Comcast and other giant internet providers from selectively boosting speeds in the future. Once its NBCUniversal obligations expire, Comcast could decide to prioritize its own video-streaming service, Streampix, while asking companies like Google, Skype, BitTorrent, and Facebook to pay to have their bits fast-tracked. Any startup that wants to compete with those incumbents will have to pay fees as well or be relegated to the second-rate public internet.  For now, fiber is the only technology that really threatens cable. Kansas City was the first city to offer Google Fiber, which is the ""single biggest frustration to agents,"" says one Time Warner employee who works in a retention department and is tasked with talking customers out of canceling their accounts. ""I can count on one hand how many times I’ve saved a person from switching to Google in the last year,"" he says. ""I see a [Kansas City] area code on the caller ID and I brace myself."" Google Fiber is only available in three cities and AT&T’s GigaPower fiber service is only available in two, but they’re pushing forward with construction. Verizon FiOS has 5.9 million internet customers, although the company has stopped its buildout. The cable industry could use its lead to lay fiber nationwide, or address its longstanding customer service issues so that customers won’t be as eager to jump ship. Instead, cable companies are responding by doing what they’ve always done: buying each other. (Comcast’s bid for Time Warner actually comes after a failed bid from Charter.) Economically, consolidation is a low-hanging fruit: more subscribers translate directly into greater revenue as well as more bargaining power with content providers. In a recent company memo, Comcast executive David Cohen cited satellite, Google Fiber, and ""more choice of pay TV providers than ever before"" as evidence that Comcast needs to get bigger. ""Comcast believes that there can be no justification for denying the company the additional scale that will help it compete more effectively,"" he writes. In June, the Time Warner branch in Broomfield, Colorado, held its quarterly all-hands meeting, the first since Comcast announced its intention to buy the company for $45 billion. Chief technical officer Michael LaJoie broke character for a moment. ""This isn’t exactly a merger of the two most beloved companies in America,"" he said. Everyone laughed. For the rest of the meeting, LaJoie, chief operations officer Dinesh Jain, and chief strategy officer Peter Stern echoed the lines that company president Rob Marcus had been writing in internal emails: We’re so excited to become part of the Comcast family. We’ll be able to deliver a superior product to our customers. We’ll have more leverage with content owners. It’ll be better for customers, better for employees, better for everyone. Except, ""there was zero talk about improving customer service,"" one attendee told The Verge. I had multiple long conversations with D’Arcy Rudnay, Comcast’s head of communications, and Tom Karinshak, senior vice president of customer experience, and it’s clear that Comcast is trying to address some of its deep-seated problems. ""Improving customer service at Comcast is our number one priority,"" Rudnay says. ""We continue to work on it, we have been working on it. It’s very important to our customer experience."" The company is in the middle of a multi-year effort to convert its all-purpose call centers into ""Centers of Excellence"" that specialize in one area, designed to prevent customers from being repeatedly transferred. A new universal billing and troubleshooting system is currently being introduced, which should reduce frustrating employee errors. But based on interviews with more than 150 current and former employees, part of a three-week investigation by The Verge, some issues seem intractable. Comcast spends more than $2 billion a year on customer service, a painfully large number for a publicly-traded company eager to maximize shareholder returns. That is perhaps why Comcast pushes its employees in customer service and tech support to make sales — a skewed incentive when customers are calling in with a problem. The company also overbooks technicians, leading to late and missed appointments, and relies heavily on contract labor, where quality control can be difficult. Finally, Comcast is still struggling with the legacies of the many companies it acquired but never fully integrated, leading to mistakes in billing and miscommunication with customers. The company is working to streamline its systems, but even Rudnay acknowledges that the effort is only in its ""first, second, or third inning."" None of this bodes well for customers of the new Comcast-Time Warner. Furthermore, while the acquisition will result in cost-savings for Comcast, the company says, those savings won’t necessarily accrue to customers. ""We’re certainly not promising that customer bills are going to go down or that they’ll increase less rapidly,"" Comcast executive vice president David Cohen has said. Stopping the merger won’t fix what’s broken in the cable industry. ""The reality is, the poor customer service, the anti-consumer stance on net neutrality, the constantly inflating prices, these are all downstream symptoms to be expected from any company allowed to accumulate too much wealth, power, and influence, while also being totally almost completely unchecked by regulation and free-market competition,"" Block says, reflecting on why his Comcast call became a meme. But ultimately, a straightforward merger of two of the most unpopular companies in the country seems unlikely to result in happier customers. ""This is not getting bigger to provide cheaper service, or economies of scale, or to provide better service,"" a billing systems manager who worked at Comcast from 2008 to 2013 tells The Verge. ""This is getting bigger for the sake of bigness. This is really like, ‘I own 10 Subway stores and now I want an 11th one.’ ""Well, if your 10 Subway stores have Cs from the health department, I don’t know if you should get an 11th one. Maybe you should work on getting them cleaned out."" Update: This story has been updated to reflect that fact that the Consumers Union, which commissioned a public poll on the Comcast-Time Warner Cable merger, openly opposes the deal. Another poll conducted by Reuters found similar results: a majority of Americans think the deal will be bad for consumers. Lead photo by Michael Shane. Russell Brandom contributed reporting.

Uber users in the Washington, DC area will see an option in their app to order from a list of 100 household items. If an Uber driver is available, the goods will be picked up and delivered to their door. There is no charge, no expectation of a tip, and no minimum purchase. It's one of many ambitious delivery services from tech companies big and small that have come online in the last few years, all of which seem, on the face of things, too good to be true. It all sounds too good to be true Uber is careful to stress that the Cornerstore operation its launching in DC is just a test. But the company and its investors have been openly discussing for some time Uber's ambition to use its fleet of drivers for more than just ferrying people between point A and point B. Benchmark's Bill Gurley, who sits on Uber's board, suggested in a recent blog post that Uber might replace not just taxis and car services, but delivery companies like UPS, car-rental incumbents like Hertz, and even the concept of car ownership entirely. It sounds like Silicon Valley Kool-Aid, of course, but as Gurley points out, Uber is already larger in many markets than earlier estimates of the size of the entire industry, and that's while they're taking just a slice of the pie. Amazon is the current king of speedy delivery, with millions using its Prime subscription service. For same-day stuff, Amazon currently operates in 12 cities, and is working on rolling out a grocery service that would offer a similar array of household items as Uber, along with more perishable fare. Google has its Shopping Express service, which is currently available in a few California cities and the island of Manhattan. Smaller startups like Instacart and WunWun are available in more locations, but also charge a fee for certain deliveries, something the larger players have so far tried to avoid. This didn't end well the first time around Where is this all headed? The dot-com boom of the 1990s saw a slew of companies rise and fall, including the infamous Webvan and Kozmo.com. I still have fond memories of ordering a can of Coke or pack of gum and having a breathless courier deliver it to my door for no charge. This time around things are a bit different, with most of the big companies involved having significant alternative revenue streams. And the startups that are delivery-only have adopted a freelancer or contractor model, allowing them to operate with far less overhead. Kozmo was even brought back from the dead to give the idea another spin. Many tech investors aren't convinced that this kind of delivery service can survive as as standalone business, but it might make a lot of sense as a method of customer acquisition, along the lines of offering free streaming music or on-demand videos. ""[Delivery] didn’t work then, and it won’t work now, unless you’re a tech giant who doesn’t mind losing money to win over consumers,"" says Rick Heitzmann, a tech investor with FirtMark Capital and backer of Zipments.

Despite the fact that Comcast has departments devoted to both inbound and outbound sales, the company encourages its employees in customer service, tech support, and other departments to make sales as well. This often puts the employee's interests at odds with the customer, who may be calling in to report a technical problem, billing issue, or to downgrade their service. Sales pressure is enforced through monetary incentives, disincentives such as being put on a corrective action plan, and pressure from managers who instant message reps while they're on the phone to ask why they haven't pitched a sale yet. Employees told us that they felt like failure to sell would get them fired ""I don’t want any of our employees to feel that pressure to go through and sell…or feel like they’re going to get fired,"" Tom Karinshak, Comcast’s senior vice president of customer experience, tells The Verge. ""That’s not good for us."" However, employees told us in no uncertain terms that they felt like the failure to make sales would get them fired. In some cases, employees told us they knew coworkers who had been let go for failure to make sales, or had been let go themselves.   The Verge obtained some of the internal training materials and metrics for customer service employees, which show the company considers sales to be worth about 20 percent of performance. Guidelines for repair reps, which show how a trouble call can be segued into a sales call, are part of S4, Comcast's ""universal call flow."" S4 is an evaluative measurement to ensure that all agents ""give every customer a great call experience every time."" It stands for: start, solve, sell, summarize. Part S3, or ""sell,"" includes four parts: ""transition to relevant offer,"" ""present offer,"" ""overcome objections,"" and ""proactively close sale."" For transitioning to a relevant offer, Comcast suggests lines like, ""Did you call us from your home phone today? I noticed that you didn't have phone service on your account,"" and ""Other than Boardwalk Empire, what kind of TV shows do you like to watch? Great, me too."" The ""sales"" portion of the call is worth 20 percent of the total score. Similarly, a scorecard for customer service reps in the Pennsylvania area shows that sales are explicitly worth 18 percent of an agent's performance. Sales are measured again in the general customer service ""Pinnacle"" metric, which is worth 27 percent.  An excerpt from the Pinnacle guidelines says ""Sales/Conversion"" is one of eight categories measured in an employee's interaction with a customer. Comcast lists situations in which a ""transition to offer"" is not such a good idea As with Comcast's retention guidelines, which explain how to keep a customer who wants to cancel their service, Comcast lists situations in which a ""transition to offer"" is not such a good idea: ""Customer is irate or doesn't seem happy with the resolution,"" ""Customer in a delinquent status,"" ""Customer volunteers a 'do not sell to me' statement."" Comcast points out that customer service will inherently include some sales: a customer who complains that their internet is too slow may want to upgrade to a faster tier, for example. But after an especially frustrating customer service call went viral, Comcast admitted it has to change: ""This situation has caused us to reexamine how we do some things to make sure that each and every one of us — from leadership to the front line — understands the balance between selling and listening,"" chief operating officer Dave Watson wrote in a memo. Comcast is now in the process of reviewing ""all training content for customer service and sales processes."" The company says it is also ""reviewing and changing the messages we use in emails or calls to customers, in our automated phone system and in other communications to reinforce that the overall customer experience is our top priority.""

In a conversation today with Kara Swisher from Recode, Clinton said she agreed with classifying internet service providers as common carriers under Title II of the Telecommunications Act but also pointed out that there was more that could be done. ""I think that for the FCC to do what they want to do — to try to create net neutrality as the norm — they have to have a hook to hang it on,"" Clinton said to Swisher. ""So, they're hanging it on Title II."" When asked whether she agreed with that ""hook,"" Clinton replied that ""it's the only one the've got."" She went on to say that ""I think that if there were another hook, it would come out of a modern 21st century telecom act. And that hasn't happened, and it's not likely to happen."" Regardless of Clinton's desire for a more comprehensive and modern telecommunications act that better accounts for the internet, she still said she'd vote for the FCC's current proposal. ""As I understand it, it's Title II with a lot of changes in it to avoid the worst of Title II regulation,"" Clinton said. ""It's a foot in the door ... but it's not the end of the discussion."" Specifically, Clinton wants to see changes enacted around incentivizing competition, something that's sorely lacking in the broadband market right now; more broadly, she hopes to see internet connectivity treated more as an infrastructure problem. ""It's not just net neutrality standing alone, end of debate,"" Clinton said. ""And that should be part of a really smart legislative endeavor, but I don't think people believe that could happen in the short term."" The FCC is set to vote on chairman Tom Wheeler's proposal this Thursday, February 26th.

Brittain is asking that the internet giant remove search results pointing to 23 sites that wrote about the FTC's decision against him (including The Verge), arguing that they include ""unauthorized information"" about him as well as ""photos which are not 'fair use.'"" Brittain allegedly charged people to have their pictures taken off his site The staggering irony of the situation is hard to ignore. The FTC originally stopped Brittain's revenge porn business in January this year, banning him from ""publicly sharing any more nude videos or photographs of people without their affirmative express consent."" The agency's complaint alleged that he not only ""used deception to acquire and post intimate images of women,"" but also operated a fake ""takedown"" service, charging individuals between $200 to $500 to have their pictures removed from his site. ""Despite presenting these as third-party services, the complaint alleges that the sites for these services were owned and operated by Brittain,"" said the FTC. The director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection added that Brittain's behavior was ""not only illegal but reprehensible."" In turn, Brittain has protested that the coverage of his case by the mainstream media has been unfair. In a statement on the reclaimed IsAnyoneDown.com (the domain was not banned, merely the posting of revenge porn) he claims that he had ""nothing to do with any 'takedown' services, with the exception of negotiated settlements through dmca.com."" He also defends other aspects of the site such as its ""bounty system"" — a service that let users post rewards of at least $100 for submitting information and photos of specific individuals. Brittain says this was ""not an attempt to buy revenge porn"" but merely an attempt to ""formally transition into regular amateur adult content."" ""No less than 200 of the women pictured were offered modeling contracts."" Brittain says that only 50 images posting on the site were actual revenge porn (i.e. pictures submitted out of spite by ex-partners), while the ""majority"" were simply ""self-posted, self-taken pictures which were already publicly posted to other websites."" He claims that ""no less than 200 of the women pictured ... were offered modeling contracts valued as high as $100,000 per year as a result of exposure generated by publicity from IAD,"" adding that the website as a whole ""promoted positive body image"" by posting pictures of individuals ""from every gender, race, origin, country, etc."" Despite his discomfort at the coverage of his past deeds, it's not likely that Brittain's DMCA requests he has filed will be heeded. The law requires companies like Google to remove links to sites posting copyrighted material, but coverage of Brittain's story falls clearly under fair use. As Ars Technica notes, it's also unlikely that Brittain would even be able to have his information removed under the EU's ""right to be forgotten"" ruling, as this only covers information that is ""inadequate, irrelevant, or no longer relevant.""",0.42226151953133884,0.5777384804686612,0.8336796073382367,533,5.3245778611632266,314,6.2993630573248405,0,0,"Policy & Law, Tech, US & World",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

That follows an earlier Bloomberg report noting that Apple had been removed from the list, as had antivirus products from Symantec and Kaspersky Lab. Windows 8 was also reported to be banned at some point last year.  Approved Chinese products are growing in number The number of approved foreign tech products has dropped by a third over the past two years, according to Reuters. Many of the cuts have focused on security products, of which more than half were removed. At the same time, Reuters reports that China's list of approved products has actually grown quite a bit. There are now nearly 5,000 products approved for government purchase — reportedly up by over 2,000 — but that jump is said to be credited almost entirely to Chinese companies. China's interest in moving toward products made within the country appears to be twofold: it removes security concerns around foreign products and bolsters its own tech industry. It's not clear which is more important to the country. The sources Reuters spoke with seem to believe that security concerns may just be a cover story, but it's not an entirely unreasonable one, particularly in light of the ongoing revelations about how far US spy agencies are willing to go for information. The US, too, has shown an unwillingness to trust foreign tech, with much being made of its frequent restrictions on the large Chinese telecom firm Huawei. The list of products approved for government purchase is made by the Central Government Procurement Center. While Reuters reports that it does not restrict local government, state-owned businesses, or the military, the list still prevents foreign companies from offering services to a large client.

In an op-ed at The Huffington Post, de Blasio writes that he views the internet as ""fundamental"" to solving income equality, which he calls the ""greatest challenge of our time."" Ensuring that the internet remains equal and open, he writes, is particularly important for those with lower incomes who could otherwise be kept back from accessing content that they need to learn, apply for jobs, or operate a business.  ""More and more each day, the internet ... is turning into a basic utility."" ""Major media companies shouldn't be gatekeeping our internet access — speeding up some content, blocking other — simply because they're able to pay for it,"" de Blasio writes. ""The FCC must not allow mega firms to stifle innovation, competition, and public goods through exorbitant price points for the speeds that drive the 21st century economy."" This is not the first time that de Blasio has come out in support of net neutrality rules, but he's now delivering a strong, final push ahead of tomorrow's vote. The proposal that'll be voted on is one that de Blasio is very much in favor of. He calls it a ""momentous milestone"" and commends FCC chairman Tom Wheeler for putting it forward. The mayor is also clear about his view that the plan to reclassify internet services under Title II, which would treat them like utilities, is appropriate and necessary. ""More and more each day, the internet — like electricity — is turning into a basic utility,"" he writes. ""And this critical resource should be treated as such."" What's particularly interesting about the letter is a second issue that de Blasio touches on but does not strongly call out: municipal broadband. The FCC is also voting on a proposal that would allow cities to build their own broadband networks even in states that have laws preventing them from doing so. While New York City does not appear to face restrictions, de Blasio writes that he commends the steps toward allowing cities to build a network should they choose. ""We must have affordable broadband,"" he writes at one point in the letter. The mayor decries the lack of options for getting internet service, pointing out that Comcast and Time Warner Cable dominate wired connections and Verizon and AT&T dominate wireless connections. ""Internet access is now essentially controlled by four companies,"" he writes. ""...That's why we need the right rules safeguarding the fast and open internet. Access to it shouldn't be a luxury only available to the privileged few."" Basically, it's going to be a big day for the FCC tomorrow, and yet another major figure is pushing for it to get the job done.

Republican representative Aaron Schock, who is already facing several ethics probes, reportedly spent more than $40,000 on private air travel from 2011 onwards, and took his interns to a sold-out Katy Perry show in June last year, a $1,928 expense that he listed as a ""PAC fundraising event."" With the legend @iamstevent A photo posted by Aaron Schock (@aaronschock) on Nov 5, 2014 at 5:56pm PST  Journalists took the location data from a number of pictures and videos Schock had uploaded to Instagram and correlated it with his flight records, using flight tracking service FlightAware to build a picture of where the congressman had traveled. In November 2013, for example, Schock was casting votes in the Capitol when a plane piloted by campaign donor Jeff Green landed at Washington's Reagan National Airport. A short time later, the congressman posted an Instagram picture from his ""Schocktoberfest"" fundraising event in Peoria, soon after Green's plane landed back in the Illinois city. Schock billed his office account $11,433 for travel during the period. In October 2014, Schock again paid Green thousands of dollars for air travel, expensing him a payment of $12,560 in the same month he also expensed $1,440 to a massage parlor for a ""fundraising event."" Schock expensed $40,000 of private flights from 2011 onwards While house representatives can now use office funds for private air travel, the law only changed in 2013, and the AP says the majority of Schock's flights took place when rules prohibited the use of campaign and taxpayer money for private flights. Investigations found that he had paid $24,000 for eight flights between May 2011 and December 2012, using the money to pay for travel using aircraft offered by campaign donors, without having secured authorization from the House Ethics Committee. Under the new rules, lawmakers can only cover their own share of a private flight with campaign money. The AP says it's not clear whether Schock's donor planes had any other passengers.

He's also become somewhat infamous for enjoying the finer things in life. Earlier this month, the congressman was hit with two ethics complaints from the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW). One claimed that he had sold his house to a campaign donor for more than three times its value, and the other suggested he had accepted free decorating services to style his office to look like British TV show Downton Abbey. Schock, in response to the complaints, told ABC News that ""haters gonna hate"" — but the Illinois lawmaker has started hiring lawyers and PR experts.

Once successful, the program would have allowed intelligence agencies to decrypt cell phone signals in mid-air or implant malware remotely into any phone with a Gemalto SIM card. Gemalto is the largest SIM card maker on the planet — it manufactures 2 billion SIM cards a year for more than 450 wireless carriers across the world, including AT&T, Sprint, and Verizon. Any compromise would have global implications. Today, Gemalto presented the findings of its investigations into the alleged hackings. While the manufacturer says it has reasonable grounds to believe that an operation by NSA and GCHQ ""probably happened,"" the company claims that the attacks only breached its office networks, and ""could not have resulted in a massive theft of SIM encryption keys."" Gemalto says the spy networks ""could not"" have stolen a massive number of its SIM encryption keys The Intercept says that operations orchestrated by spy networks to obtain the encryption keys took place between 2010 and 2011, the same two years that Gemalto identified ""two particularly sophisticated intrusions."" But Gemalto says that by that time, it had already ""widely deployed a secure transfer system,"" that made obtaining the keys difficult, claiming that ""only rare exceptions to this scheme could have led to theft."" If those rare cases were to occur, Gemalto says GCHQ and the NSA would only be able to spy on communications sent over old 2G networks anyway — 3G and 4G connections are not vulnerable to the method of attack the agencies would be using. Last week's report claims that attacks were aimed at mobile operators in Afghanistan, Yemen, India, Serbia, Iran, Iceland, Somalia, Pakistan and Tajikistan. In the case of Pakistan, The Intercept's documents say that the method of interception the attackers were using failed to produce results. Gemalto says its highly secure data exchange method, which it claims prevents attackers from being able to collect keys, was live in the country at the time. Spy agencies reportedly targeted several groups for SIM data The Intercept's report focuses on Gemalto as the source of what it calls ""massive key theft,"" but the company says that it was one of several parties targeted by GCHQ and the NSA for the collection of SIM data. ""Gemalto has never sold SIM cards to four of the twelve operators listed in the documents,"" it says, making specific reference to a Somali carrier it has never done business with from whom 300,000 keys were reportedly stolen. Another document showed a list of personalization centers in Japan, Colombia, and Italy — countries in which Gemalto says it had no such centers at the time. Instead, Gemalto says that were there indeed a ""massive theft"" of SIM encryption keys, the blame is more likely to fall away from SIM suppliers such as itself.

Routh, 27, was found guilty of fatally shooting Kyle and his friend Chad Littlefield at a firing range near Fort Worth in February 2013. A prosecutor in the case said that Routh acted coldly and deliberately, waiting until Kyle had completely unloaded his weapon before ambushing the pair from behind. Routh's lawyers argued that he was a paranoid schizophrenic who believed that Kyle and Littlefield were plotting to kill him. The jury deliberated for just over two hours before finding Routh guilty. Prosecutors did not seek the death penalty. KYLE WAS LIONIZED IN HIS HOME STATE FOR HIS MILITARY RECORD The defense initially tried to have the case moved from Erath county, arguing that it would be impossible to have a fair trial there. Kyle has been lionized in his home state, where the former rancher turned Navy SEAL was celebrated for holding the most confirmed kills of any US military sniper. Two days before jury selection began, the 2nd of February was declared ""Chris Kyle Day"" by Greg Abbott, the Republican governor of Texas. Candidates for the jury were asked whether they had seen American Sniper, the adaptation of Kyle's bestselling 2012 autobiography directed by Clint Eastwood. The film earned more than $400 million in the box office and was nominated for six Academy Awards, winning the prize for best sound editing. Routh's lawyers argued that the former marine was experiencing a psychotic episode when he shot the two men. Mitchell Dunn, a psychiatrist that interviewed Routh extensively, testified that the defendant held many delusions, saying: ""He began to think that Mr. Kyle and Mr. Littlefield were some type of pig assassins — hybrid pigs sent here to kill people."" Kyle himself texted Littlefield on the way to the firing range to say that Routh was ""straight-up nuts."" Routh's family members also said that they believed he was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, although it was noted that Routh was a weapons technician in the army and so did not see direct combat.",0.3517555737405641,0.6482444262594359,0.8539094620143771,361,5.0083102493074794,231,5.779220779220779,0,0,US & World,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

Always On. One hundred countries. Listen to Beats 1 for more than a few songs and without fail someone will get on a mic to remind you the global reach of Apple Music's tentpole radio station. But while the ambition is there, does Beats 1 translate globally? Turns out, The Verge is also worldwide and always on. So we tasked some of our writers both in the US and internationally — specifically London, Tokyo, and Paris — to listen to the first 24 hours of Beats 1 radio. This is a running log.  12:02PM ET It's just past noon on a beautiful sunny day in New York City, I'm at Verge HQ sitting next to a wireless speaker, and just two minutes shy of its scheduled launch time, Beats 1 is on the air. The station had been streaming Brian Eno's Music For Airports prior to its first broadcast, which I realized later was perfect for a pre-Beats world, due to its lack of lowercase beats. BBC Radio vet Zane Lowe is our first DJ, broadcasting from LA, and he already sounds like he's been marathon pledge-driving for the past 24 hours. His first track is ""City"", a song from a UK band called Spring King that I have never heard of. ""And just like that, to one hundred countries around the world..."" RADIO!! 12:06 Zane plays the new Beck song, ""Dreams."" ""IS THERE AN ARTIST OUT THERE WHO MORE EMBODIES THE FREEWHEELING NATURE OF CREATIVITY THAN BECK?"" Zane is very very VERY turnt. 12:14 Zane keeps talking about us, the listeners, being early adopters. It's weird to think of myself as an early adopter for listening to this; I'd assume everyone would want to listen to the first half hour of Beats Radio, but looking at my Twitter feed it's clear not everyone is as interested in live events and radio as much as I am. 12:15 Hey, weren't we supposed to be able to fave and save music directly from the station as it streams? I try with the current song, ""Shutdown"" by UK rapper Skepta. I can't do anything with it, not even heart it. I am very amused at how British this global radio station is so far. 12:19 Now they're playing a weird, 15-second Apple Music hype track. It kind of sounds like when your local car dealership makes a cool and tough-sounding rap song to try to fit in with the rest of the rotation. Can I create a playlist from this? 12:22 AC/DC - ""For Those About to Rock We Salute You."" This time I can save and fave. Seems spotty, and not entirely dependent upon whether or not the song is on Apple Music. The First Pharrell. It won't be the last 12:33 Zane is ready to premiere his ""World Record."" It's a new Pharrell song called ""Freedom."" I can't save or fave this one either, but that's okay, because as soon as it ends Zane runs it back again. ""You know I have to do this!"" he yells. 12:40 Zane shouts out his mother and his brother listening in New Zealand. Another new tag: ""Zane Lowe breaking new music."" The breaking new music is Courtney Barnett's ""Dead Fox,"" which is not terribly new or breaking, but still welcome as the first Beats 1 song by a female artist. 12:56 I need to make a quick bank trip and take Beats away from my desk for the first time. It's very strange to have something live and mobile in my ears, even though I grew up with a radio walkman. As I cross Broadway, I look around, wondering if anyone else is listening right now. Then I remember how the speaker in the Verge office was a full minute behind my phone's stream on my headphones. There's something a little melancholic about that: as Beats listeners, we'll never be perfectly synced, at least not in the way you can be stuck in gridlock in LA and hear the same radio station playing in the car next to you.   I'm in line at the teller. Zane says the only genre of Beats 1 is ""great."" It's interesting that this is somehow more monoculture than terrestrial radio — your local Top 40 station will of course say that its music is ""great,"" but it's primary mission is not to play ""good"" music, it's to play music that serves a certain demographic. There's not really a demographic for Beats 1 besides ""musical omnivore."" It's internet person music. 1:17 ""The chairman of the board!"" Zane plays Dre's ""Let Me Ride"" and makes a big deal about The Chronic being available on Apple Music, the first it's been available digitally. It's crazy censored here, though. It should be noted that Zane is still talking — nay, yelling — in between every single song. 2:02 And that's a wrap on Zane Lowe's first set for Beats 1. He ends with Lapsley's ""Falling Short"" which goes straight into Jamie xx's ""I Know There's Gonna Be (Good Times)."" This is the first time there have ever back-to-back songs without an interruption and OH MY GOD, what a relief. 2:04 Our new DJ Emmie is out of New York for the first hour-long ""City Block"" set on Beats 1 NYC. Her first song is Alabama Shakes' ""Don't Wanna Fight."" 2:20 Theeere we go. The first Taylor Swift track of Beats 1 radio is on, and it is — what else? — the ""Bad Blood"" remix ft. Kendrick Lamar. In less than two and a half hours, this station has played Taylor, AC/DC, and a song entirely in French by Belgian artist Stromae. 2:25 Vic Mensa's ""U Mad"" is on and, as usual, is exactly what I want to hear. This set feels more like a hangout than Zane's did; more or less what your friends would play at a get together. It's not as urgent about being the best, most important musical moment of your life. 2:33 Case in point: Justin Timberlake's ""Senorita"" just came on. I'm pretty happy with this. 2:38 Pharrell produced ""Senorita,"" so by means of transition, it's time to hear ""Freedom"" again. This is the fourth time this song has played since Beats 1 started airing, which is way more frequent than even the most overplayed songs on terrestrial radio. 2:56 Emmie signs off. I think she did a good job! The Weeknd's ""I Cant Feel My Face"" comes on, which debuted after the Apple Music announcement at WWDC. SYNERGY! 2:59 I have to go to a meeting, so I bring a wireless speaker into a conference room and listen at minimum volume as Julie Adenuga starts her first set out of London. 3:29 Now playing: Formation, ""Hangin"" (Radio edit).wav. Yes, that was an actual .wav file ending on that track. Julie's actually playing a ton of dance stuff that isn't on Apple Music, and a lot of which doesn't even have cover art. I wish I could actually listen to this right now! 4:01PM ET ""That is the sounds of the UK,"" bellows London-based DJ Julie Adenuga, now in the second half of her set. Current London time is 9PM; current time here is 4PM ET. For those looking for something more manic, I just found a playlist for Zane's first set. Right now it's Jamie xx - ""I Know There's Gonna Be (Good Times),"" but Beats 1 is still saying it's DJ Zinc's ""138 Trek."" This has been a consistent problem all day, with the ""now playing"" metadata showing the next track too early or hanging on the last track way, way too long. 4:08 A full reset ""fixed it"" — Boogie's ""Oh my"" is playing (definitely censored), but now the app thinks it's ""Feel (feat. Bahia),"" which it turns out is the next track. Go figure. Meanwhile, always a good reminder: Today on Twitter, watch live as #millennials react to the idea of a radio station 4:24 Adenuga makes her pitch: ""We are gonna be in the club every day in the show"" even if you're not in the club! Even if it's breakfast for you, you'll be eating breakfast... in the club! Now playing: Foals - ""What Went Down."" 4:37 Around the time Melé's ""Ambience"" is playing, Adenuga starts painting a scene for the 100 countries listening. Ladies? ""Imagine you're in a sequin bra thing, I don't know. Guys, you gotta have some bigger horns..."" or at least that's how I heard it, and there's no way to back up and find out otherwise. ""You're walking through the streets. You have to feel some ambience."" 5:00 Adenuga finishes her set with Lauryn Hill covering ""Feeling Good"" and suddenly she's now my favorite person ever (also, these are feelings I'm having for someone who's probably just double-clicking on a song title, and honestly I could listen to this song whenever I want — I acknowledge that). Yet again, Beats 1 has already fav'd this song for me, and while I'm not sure why, this time I agree. 5:01 Beats 1 LA is on with... I have no idea who the DJ is, actually. But the first song is D.R.A.M.'s ""Cha Cha"" for the second time today, which samples the Star World from Super Mario World so I'm digging. Not a clue what this hour will be like, though. 5:08 An as-yet unnamed female DJ reminds us that Beats 1 radio is ""on in over 100 countries,"" just to drive home the notion that we're all experiencing the same songs through various lenses of culture and sleepiness. ""Thank you if you updated your phone today"" is still the weirdest thing to hear in a ""radio"" voice. For all intents and purposes, this is classic radio with brief moments of app support. 5:26 I drop everything to watch the new Kendrick Lamar music video, and because of that, I'm missing Years & Years and Alabama Shakes and ... it's actually stressful that I'm missing out because I don't want to miss out on something else. There is no pause in Beats 1; if you stop, the metadata stops updating with the current track, so now I've got Beats 1 running on mute just to see the tracks. 5:35 Eminem's ""Phenomenal"" yet again (sigh), and after that someone ""biked"" to the studio to pimp tomorrow's interview and the play ""The Real Slim Shady."" Fun fact: ""V-D"" is another thing you can't say on Beats 1 radio. 5:42 From Eminem to Ibeyi to HAIM to... Jack Garatt? Okay, what is this block of music? The central conceit seems to be ""let's just throw some songs in a playlist and see what happens."" There is no voice here, both literally (in how little the unnamed DJs are talking) and in the curation. 5:56 Mumford & Sons' ""The Wolf."" I give up. Beats 1 radio pre-liked the Skrillex / Diplo / Justin Bieber ""Where Are Ü Now"" song for me. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. Why. No. No. No. 6:02 Here we go with Cam'ron's ""Come Home With Me"" to start Ebro's set. Jay Z alert! 6:05 The World Radio equivalent to a request line is now apparently a hashtag — in this case, #Beats1Ebro. Now playing: a radio edit of Nas' ""NY State of Mind"" that's so heavily censored it's not really that enjoyable. 6:13 Darden clarifies how the DJ-audience relationship is going to work here: he's bringing New York to 100 countries. GOOD MORNING, TOKYO! HAVE SOME NEW YORK! But for real, there's actual cohesion in this block, and it's great. 6:19 Beastie Boys' ""Paul Revere"" is cut short. The #Beats1Ebro requests are coming in and asking for more Hov, apparently, so Darden is going to play more Hov. I don't know how much of this is fueled by Tidal lulz, but ""99 Problems"" is a damn good listen. 6:34 Kanye West and Jay Z ""Otis"" — damn, there's a lot of Jay Z in here — followed by the actual song sampled, Otis Redding's ""Try A Little Tenderness."" 6:42 ""... and the reason I'm transitioning [from Otis Redding]"" is to get us to Leon Bridges, a lesser-known act with a great old school vibe. Darden is showing (or at least giving the appearance of) thoughtfulness in his selection and order, none of which was present in that awful ""Live from LA"" filler set. 6:50 Looks like we're getting a whole sub-block dedicated to Pharrell, starting with the new Puff Daddy track ""Finna Get Loose"" (he's Puff Daddy again, right?) and then into Ludacris' ""Southern Hospitality,"" Snoop's ""Drop it Like It's Hot,"" Future's ""Move That Dope,"" and of course the song of the day ""Freedom."" This is the part about human curation I like, with Darden adding relevant context around his picks (reminder: this is millennials discovering radio). 6:55 ""Just reminding you what Pharrell gave us"" is Darden's repeated mantra. ""I play this record 100 times today if I feel like it"" he says as he intros ""Freedom"" (to be fair, we actually haven't heard it in a couple hours, which is a new record). The difference this time is that we're getting Ebro's laugh interspersed. 7:02 We're now into a Borough Check sub-show, which seems to be a loose justification for playing songs somewhat related to the five boroughs of New York. At this point, I've got an Amazon Echo set up in the kitchen (which arrived during the second half of Adenuga's set) and am now using it exclusively for Beats 1 radio. The experience has suddenly become more passive, I'm using my phone less to like / unlike / check the song title. It's just... radio, for better and for worse. 7:16 Brooklyn checked (MS MR's ""Painted""), Queens checked (Nina Sky's ""Forever""), and Staten Island checked (Method Man and Redman's ""Da Rockwilder""), and now it's time for MORE Jay Z (""What More Can I Say?""). (When was the last time I heard the actual Black Album and not the Danger Mouse ""gray album"" mashup? This sounds wrong now.) 7:24 ""Forgot About Dre"" might be the most edited song of the day. I'm pretty sure a good 25 percent of Eminem's lines were cut. The album art even says CENSORED VERSION in big letters. ""You don’t know what fleek is? We don’t either, but it means good.""  7:39 ""The team in New York just run in SUPER HYPED because of Kendrick's video""... which, he says, is on fleek. Here's the explanation for all 100 countries: ""You don't know what fleek is? We don't either, but it means good."" They're now talking about the ""Alright"" video... so of course now we're listening to ""Alright."" Darden's show has really felt live. There's impulsiveness and interactivity. 8:04 LA-based Travis Mills takes over with the request show and it's D.R.A.M.'s ""Cha Cha."" Which, if you recall, is the song that kicked off the last Los Angeles set. You know, that really bad one. 8:06 Whereas Darden played up hashtags for sending requests, Travis is using an email address — specifically, beats1radio@icloud.com. Seriously! iCloud! He plays Blink 182's ""What's My Age Again?"" 8:10 I should note that advertising is at a minimum. There are no commercials, just the occasional voice saying ""Beats 1 is made possible by [x]"" — in this case a hotel chain. Nothing too crazy. 8:22 STOP EVERYTHING! JADEN SMITH HAS CALLED IN TO REQUEST THE BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER THEME SONG. This is a blatant abuse of the ""100 countries"" reach. It was also a chance for him to promote his show later this week. And they're playing it! Breaking: Jaden Smith just called into Beats 1 radio to request the ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" theme song to be played worldwide. And it was 8:23 AND NOW THEY ARE PLAYING IT FOR A SECOND TIME. JADEN IS MY HERO. 8:30 ... annnnnnnd Jaden Smith broke Beats 1. 8:30PM ET Welp, I'm here and ready for some tunes, but it seems like me and the rest of the the Verge crew is getting an error message. Beats 1 is still down. So yeah, Apple's still-developing skill with cloud services is being highlighted here. Not a good look for your first day. 9:06 We're finally back with Ariana Grande's ""Love Me Harder."" DJ Travis Mills is giving me flashbacks to my middle school days listening to Z-100. There is no small irony in a request show on a live radio station attached to a streaming music service where I can hear whatever I want with the click of a button. A request show on live radio attached to a music-on-demand service 9:21 Zane is back in the studio plugging the ""World Record"" again. ""We played the same Pharrell jam three times! It's hard to get your head around,"" Zane says, of being a single global stream playing in different time zones. He explains that he had a lot of coffee today. Now we get to listen to ""Freedom"" again! Not clear if anyone requested this, or if Travis is making an exception from his format for the World Record of the day. 9:29 The DJs are plugging an upcoming show, St. Vincent's Mixtape Delivery Service. People write in to request a mixtape about their lives, then St. Vincent chats with them and curates a mix. Sounds pretty fun! Or as Travis would say, ""so ill."" 10:00 Time for St. Vincent's Mixtape Delivery Service! Piper is the first guest — she's 11 and has singing parties by herself at night. She thinks St. Vincent is the coolest. I hope Piper was not listening to the last 45 minutes of raunchy rap! But it sure is sweet of St. Vincent to make her a mixtape. The first cut is ""Enjoy the Silence"" by Depeche Mode, which Piper probably missed when it came out, because she's 11. Next up is some Stereolab. This sounds like good college radio. 10:06 If I wanted to subscribe to this show and get a push notification when St. Vincent was on the air, could I do that? If so, I can't tell how. 10:23 In between songs there is an image of St. Vincent and the name of her show — but I can't share that out or start a station based on it. I can only share a generic link to Beats 1. I feel like they should be smart enough to let users fave, follow, share, and discover based on the DJ / show when the style and selection is going to be so varied across Beats 1. 10:37 Piper has a pet dog and pet cat and spends a lot of time playing and arguing with her two sisters. St. Vincent has two sisters, too! Something tells me Piper is gonna be a lot cooler now that her episode of the St. Vincent show has aired on Apple's new radio station. 11:00 Piper and Vincent sign off, then we get a big Beats 1 drop and A$AP Rocky's ""Wild For the Night."" Part of the joy of the St. Vincent show was knowing who it was for and what it was about. The rest of Beats feels very generic — if it's for a global audience and not really repping a city, it's just naturally harder to connect with. That has been what made radio great for me in NYC and Memphis. 11:05 Tove Lo - ""Talking Body."" Is there disease like narcolepsy that makes you completely deaf for a period of time? Because I would like to have that now. 11:07 Weird — it sounds like they are going to replay Zane's first show? Not a great look for your live radio station to start spinning re-runs after just 12 hours — We're still repping LA right now. (It's unclear where St. Vincent was broadcasting from.) 11:14 An ad! ""Beats 1 is made possible by AlphaBetty Saga: play with words."" 11:21 Our new DJ Brooke Reese says this is ""Beats 1 broadcasting to 100 countries, whether you are winding down or waking up."" That right there is why this station makes no sense. I would want completely different music for those two times and mental states. I would want completely different music for those two times and mental states. 11:34 Oh, my. Boogie Brooke says that ""T and I are just vibing on this. Straight Outta Compton. But can we do it up for the Mumford and Son fans out there? We gotch you!"" Straight out of Compton, these sons of Mumford. She plays ""The Wolf"" from their new album Wilder Mind, then segues right back into a censored version of ""Nuthin But A G Thang."" I can't think of a single person who listens to gangsta rap and Mumford and Sons together but maybe Beats 1 is onto something here. 11:55 I swear there was just a plug about how Beats 1 is ""always live"" right after the DJ said they were about to replay Zane's show. It's been a huge launch, says not-live Zane — incredible to think people in 100 countries are listening — and the first band of the day, Spring King, are back. It's always noon somewhere! 12:02AM ET So here we are at 1PM on a rainy Tokyo afternoon, and I'm listening to a radio show that aired 12 hours ago. 12:14 The whole setup of Beats 1 is very Western hemisphere and Anglophone. Lowe keeps talking about the 100 hundred countries he's broadcasting to, but how many people can even understand what he's saying? At least his compatriots in New Zealand get to listen to him over lunch, just like Americans. ""The whole setup of Beats 1 is very Western hemisphere and Anglophone."" Of course, this is what you get with the Beats 1 concept — it is what it claims to be, a single radio station broadcasting to the world at once. It's meant to be as one-size-fits-all as possible, and there's no more universal language than music. Even if right now it's not going to be more than background music for most.  So while Japan might not care too much about Zane Lowe, Apple Music could still be a pretty big deal here. 12:40 This Courtney Barnett song is great. That probably marks the first time in over a decade that Zane Lowe has got me into something. But I do wonder why some songs are instantly ""likable"" and others aren't, as Emily pointed out. It's not at all transparent and is going to be pretty frustrating. 1:00 One hour into my Beats 1 shift and there's been nothing that feels specific to where I am — it's just a Zane Lowe radio repeat. Maybe there's something Apple could do based on location to customize each show, but I guess it'd detract from the ""purity"" of the idea. 1:20 The censored version of Dre's ""Let Me Ride"" sounds like a garbled Skype recording. 2AM The ghost of Zane is done, and we're back live in LA with a chart show meant to include the ""20 biggest songs in the world,"" whatever that means. Tinie Tempah kicking things off. Brooke recommends checking out his pool parties in Ibiza. 2:05 Next we have Jason Derulo, a man I have never heard and feel like I have not been missing out on. 2:10 The Weeknd - ""The Hills."" I wonder if The Weeknd stipulated Beats rotation in the deal he made to appear on stage at WWDC — he's been on a lot in this first day. 2:13 Number 15 in the chart is ""Eyes Shut"" by Years & Years. Still not sure how this chart is calculated. 2:20 Now we're hearing from Miguel, whose Lenny Kravitz-featuring ""Face the Sun"" takes number 13.  ""It's the hope and desperation that keeps me going,"" he says. ""Because without desperation, it'd be too easy."" He wants you all to ""have a bit of **** in you"" and I honestly don't know what was bleeped out.  2:26 ""Bad Blood"" takes 12, but Brooke plays literally 20 seconds before switching to number 11, ""Lean On"" by Major Lazer. I can get behind that, I guess. 2:29 Silento's ""Watch Me (Whip / Nae Nae)"" at 9. They're really blowing through tunes here — I missed 10 completely. 2:34 Number 8 is ""Shut Up And Dance"" by Walk The Moon, which I have never heard, but which is not good. A recurring theme on this show, I have to say. 2:41 Justin Bieber is number 6, but Brooke skips it after about 10 seconds. Now playing number 5: Selena Gomez ft. A$AP Rocky, ""Good for You."" Guess we know which side she's on. 2:44 Rachel Platten's ""Fight Song"" is number 3, and seriously, how did I miss number 4? I am admittedly doing work beyond just staring at my speakers for four hours straight but this is a very difficult show to follow if you're not paying absolute attention. 2:47 Peter Robinson of Popjustice, who I trust on pop music like no other, says the Beats 1 chart show is ""quite strange"" and I am inclined to agree. Meek Mill's ""All Eyes on You"" is number 2. Of what, I still don't know. 2:51 Meghan Trainor and John Legend take the first ever Beats 1 number one spot with ""Like I'm Gonna Lose You."" I almost kind of maybe miss Zane Lowe. 2:55 Wait, Omi's ""Cheerleader"" is apparently number 1? One of us, Brooke or I, is confused. Maybe both of us are. Anyway, this certainly isn't the Radio 1 Top 40 I grew up listening to on Sunday evenings. Bring on Julie Adenuga. 3:14AM ET Good morning from Paris, which along with much of Europe, is in the middle of a major heat wave. It's 9AM here, and I'm already stuck to my couch. I've just tuned in to a repeat of Julie Adenuga's show, and I really need music to keep my heart rate low.  3:14 Julie says her show is ""All about sounds of London"" — up now is ""London Living"" by Plastician ft. Jammz.  So far, so good. A nice slinky beat to drink my coffee to. 3:17 ""Pride"" by Adesse Versions. Julie: ""I got something that will surely set your stuff on fire."" NOPE. TOO HOT.  3:24 So far there's not a ton of editorializing from Julie, other than reminding us that this is the first day of Beats 1 and that she's going to play the best music ever. She shares an anecdote about the first time she met Zane Lowe. ""Probably one of the most inspirational people I've ever met."" 3:40 Nao's ""Zillionaire"" is on now. I appreciate what they're trying to do with 24/7, always-on radio, but part of me wonders whether it would've been more interesting if it was more US-centric. I was kind of hoping to hear more of the offbeat / stoner late-night stuff you would typically hear during the overnight US hours, rather than just a straight repeat. Wonder how much of the ""radio experience"" we'll lose with a radio station that has no real clock. 3:47 Julie says she's going to call some shots. First shot called, first official anthem: ""Cha Cha"" by D.R.A.M. This is perfect for right now. Island beats mixed with Super Mario coin sounds. Heart rate returning to normal. Favorited. This guy agrees: @Beats1 Thumbs up for the Cha Cha! 3:55 Julie keeps reminding us that this is the first day ever. ""This is a very, very huge day. This is big."" It all kind of loses its weight knowing that this isn't really live. 4:16 I should note that I'm hearing a lot of this music for the first time, which I take as a sign of good DJing. But it still kind of sucks knowing that I'm listening to a repeat. If @Beats1 is going to bill itself as 24/7 it shouldn't be repeating shows 12 hours later. 4:23 ""We are going to be in the club every day on this show,"" says Julie. I'm not sure I want that at 10 AM on a Wednesday. 4:25 Now it's Foals' ""What Went Down."" It makes sense that they would kick Beats 1 off with a London focus, but I really hope they branch out in the future — at least if they want to make this ""global."" I'd love to hear a Berlin hour. Also, all of Africa / the Middle East / Asia is awake right now. 4:30 Jesus, it's hot. 5:00 Julie closes with Lauryn Hill's cover of Nina Simone's ""Feeling Good."" 5:04 Aaaand we're back to Pharrell's ""Freedom."" It's only the second time I've heard it, and I think that's enough. 5:06 Justin Bieber, Skrillex, & Diplo's ""Where are U Now"" comes on. Where are you now, I wonder, because Julie's gone and there's a new guy who just kind of mumbled his name in the intro. 5:22 ""You don't own me"" by Grace ft. G-Eazy. There's very little interjection here from the DJ. Hard to discern any sort of curation, either. 5:29 ""Good for You"" by Selena Gomez, ft. A$AP Rocky. Another Beats 1 favorite, apparently. If the goal was to create non-offensive background music then I think Beats 1 succeeds. (Maybe that's the point of radio in general?) But for this segment at least, there's no sherpa guiding me through, which I thought was going to be a major component of Beats 1. Kind of miss the narrative and picture-painting of Julie's set. 5:56 BBC 6 still does a much better job of engaging on Twitter. Oooh yes! #nowplaying @amywinehouse-Valerie #MemoryTapes Beats 1 hasn't tweeted in three hours. 6:02 ""We're live from New York,"" said Ebro, yesterday. We're still in replay mode. 6:07 A world that censors the word ""cocaine"" is not a world I want to live in. ""We're live from New York,"" said Ebro, Yesterday I'm still really disappointed to be listening to America's leftovers, but the DJs do a pretty good job of masking that. Nothing in their speech really timestamps their shows, aside from Ebro occasionally mentioning that this is the ""first day"" and the fact that it's still 6AM in NY. 6:19 This seems like a pretty good Day 1 intro to NYC hip-hop, but I'm interested to see how themed the programming is going forward. You can't do a New York history show every day, right? 6:26 Another plug for Zane Lowe's Eminem interview ""tomorrow,"" which is actually today. Followed up by Em's ""Lose Yourself."" 6:35 Now it's Jay Z and Kanye with ""Otis"" from Watch the Throne. It is pretty cool to think that X number of people in the world are also listening to this song right now, but that's also something you can do on any BBC music show as well. But I would still really like to know what X is, and how that X is distributed. Feels like there's a missed opportunity to add a more social experience to this. 6:51 It is still very hot in Paris right now. 7:02 I'm sort of surprised they haven't transitioned to live programming yet as the US begins to wake up. Ebro's set has been pretty great (I like hip-hop), but it still sort of feels like I'm listening to Hot 97, not a ""global"" station. 7:07 It's been a while since I've heard Pharrell; hope he's okay. 7:09 Ebro says St. Vincent's mixtape thing is coming up in three hours, which is, again, super confusing because this is a replay and time doesn't exist anymore. 7:15 Jay Z's ""What More Can I Say"" is followed up by Rihanna's ""Bitch Better Have My Money."" ""Everyone is friends of Apple Music,"" Ebro says, jabbing at Jay and Rihanna's ownership stakes in Tidal. ""We don't play no favorites."" 7:36 Biggie, finally, with ""Juicy."" 8:02AM ET It is two minutes past 1PM in the UK, and I am thinking intense, sandwich-related thoughts. I am not thinking about club classics or dance floor fillers, but obviously Beats 1 has a more ambitious approach to my social life than I do. I've looked back over my colleagues' comments, and I'm honestly not sure if I'm in the middle of a repeated set or not. Welcome to the confusion that is Beats 1. 8:07 Shamir - ""On the Regular."" For some reason the app isn't updating either the album art or the track details. Twitter tells me I'm not the only one with the problem. Beats 1 has a tedious amount of teething problems. 8:09 Nine minutes in, and it's my first ad break! Someone purrs that ""Beats One is made possible by Aloft hotels,"" before being quickly faded out. Almost as if they're ashamed. 8:13 Skepta - ""Shutdown."" Finally, some continuity announcements. Jordan Stevens tells me he's DJing live from ""London town"" (a location that's pretty much only mentioned by cockneys in musicals and rappers) and that he's just had a ""really good"" brownie. He doesn't mention that the UK is currently suffering through its hottest July day on record ever, which would surely be natural color for a local broadcast. For once the weather is actually worth talking about and Beats 1 flubs it. Ah well, at least we're listening to some good grime. Boy better know. 8:28 Rolling Stones - ""Gimme Shelter."" More proof that Beats 1 manages to swing wildly from genre to genre without ever leaving the middle ground. Which is fine! This is a commercial radio station, you don't want to blast people with B-sides from Their Satanic Majesties Request. ""Is there a name for Rolling Stones fans?"" asks Jordan. ""A stoner? I'd say a lot of me and my friends are stoners."" Lol @ Jordan. He follows up ""Gimme Shelter"" with ""Paint it Black."" Fine, I've got 100 percent on Guitar Hero on that, so a lot of great memories. Also, I think radio DJs are not allowed to have any chill. Contractually obliged, even. I guess one way around the idea of trying to play music for different timezones is to be just constantly hyped instead. I blame capitalism. Being relaxed is a moral failing! Excitement Constantly! Work Forever! Fono's ""Real Joy"" is playing. 9:00 St Vincent's Mixtape Delivery Service Named after the Ghibli film surely? It's a repeat, but it's brilliant. St Vincent interviews listeners and builds playlists for them, with the first show dedicated to new-wave synth classics and an 11-year-old who might have been genetically engineered to be suuuuper cuuuute. Kicks off with Depeche Mode's ""Enjoy the Silence"" and is pretty much gold until it ends with Talking Heads' ""Once in a Lifetime."" The thing is, this is great, but is it what Beats 1 is for? Apple could (relatively) easily build a lineup of great, diverse, structured shows like this, but it would mean that it's harder to drop in and drop out of Beats 1. It would kill the whole commercial radio vibe which — infuriating as it may be to listen to for four hours straight — is a successful formula. Don't know what to play? Stick on Beats 1, they'll probably have some alright tunes. That's probably not a bad way to funnel people into a paid service, but it means being generic — not curated like St Vincent. 10:02 Tinie Tempah - ""Not Letting Go."" Oh look, it's the Beats 1 countdown chart. Woo. Everyone loves charts. They go wild for them. Nothing gets the party started like numerical sequences. Sigh. Who am I supposed to feel connected to right now? My question is now: who am I supposed to feel connected to right now? The point has been made that the reach of Beats 1 somehow makes it special. That because all these people are tuned in (worldwide), the music has that intangible extra something. It's not just music, but a medium of connection. Well, in the words of disappointed clubgoers the world over, I'm just not really feeling it. It might take time for more people to talk about Beats 1, for the DJs and shows to get a buzz around them, but even if they do, not everyone will listen to them at the same time. Anyway, that was the Chart Show. It will happen everyday. It is unlikely to ever give people a thrill. It is very transactional and that's probably fine. 11:07 Courtney Barnett - ""Pedestrian Best."" Okay, well, this woke me up. I mean, I'd completely forgotten that I loved buzzy, slangy rock songs with loose bass lines and lead singers that don't sing but just grumble depressive / aggressive monologues about how how everything's grim and yet still worth destroying. I might actually be discovering new music, as they say in the advertising copy. 11:40 Leon Bridges - ""Better Man."" More wild swings of the genre dial back to soul. Bridges apparently records all his tracks on vintage gear and therefore ""sounds straight out of the '50s."" Amazingly, his attempts at period authenticity even extend to gender politics, with his song cheerfully dividing women into ""jezebels"" and that one girl with a ""golden smile."" Eh. FKA Twigs next, who wouldn't stand for that bullshit. 11:56 Not sure if this is a reflection of Beats Music or simply my personal feelings about this experience, but it does feel like everything has slowed to a bit of a crawl. Songs keep on skipping about, dipping back 30 seconds or so (sometimes even into the previous track) before regaining the stream. I never thought I would be looking forward so much to hearing Zane Lowe speak, but here we are. And what does he have to say about things? ""Beats 1 is hopefully now established as your go-to,"" says Zane. Not yet, no.",0.6284515882246198,0.3715484117753802,0.18147609238393939,6291,4.4603401684946746,2375,5.9267368421052629,1,16,"Culture, Entertainment, Music",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

I'm Jamieson, I'm still your host, and I'm happy to be taking you into the long weekend with a few new and worthwhile jams. America! Let's do this!   (I celebrated Canada Day earlier this week.) There's a Spotify playlist at the end for your listening convenience, and feel free to share your favourite cuts from this week in the comments. (I'm reading them and listening, promise.) Let's go: Beach House, ""Sparks"": Like Liam Neeson in Taken, the members of Beach House have a very particular set of skills; they just happen to be musical rather than murderous. In their case, they churn out a new collection of gauzy, day-drunk dream-pop every few years like clockwork. The scale changes, the tones change, but the core is the same: simple, sticky guitar melodies from Alex Scally and robust vocal performances from Victoria LeGrand. ""Sparks"" is the first single from their upcoming Depression Cherry, and though it starts out a little noisier than you might expect, it only takes a few minutes for Beach House to come home. There's joy in doing one thing really, really well.   Bilal, ""Open Up the Door"": Bilal was swept up in the neo-soul wave that crested as the '90s turned into the '00s, working alongside luminaries like Erykah Badu and D'Angelo on warm, diverse R&B. In Another Life is his third album in five years, and it's more of the same: organic soul and funk that's well sung and a little unfocused. ""Open Up the Door"" is a little shaggy and wide-eyed, like some Stevie Wonder C-side salvaged from the '70s.   Demi Lovato, ""Cool for the Summer"": There are so many reasons not to like this song. That mercenary EDM piano line that cracks it open! The bicurious tourism for the sake of shock value! (Demi is a great LGBT ally, but I wanna see the receipts.) Those cheesy synth-rock riffs in the chorus! And yet it all comes together like one of those mystery Slurpees you'd make as a kid, six flavors thrown together into some unholy mixture in a single XL cup. Blame pop savant Max Martin and a surprising, salacious Demi vocal take. This one's ready for the radio.   The Internet, ""Under Control"": And now for something completely different: a subtle, moody bit of languid soul from a woman who isn't just toying with same-sex attraction. Odd Future alum Syd tha Kyd is plain-spoken and sensual on ""Under Control,"" a highlight from her group The Internet's new album Ego Death. I want my summer to sound like this: nights so warm you feel their weight on you, shabby joints on quiet rooftops, time in a space between sleep and dreaming.   LA Priest, ""Lady's in Trouble with the Law"": This is a weird one, pop pitched halfway between Prince's alien, mechanical funk and Ariel Pink's outsider melodies. The song is catchy, but it comes at you from an angle you don't expect. I'm not very familiar with Sam Dust's work — he's the creative force behind LA Priest — but this is the kind of song that makes me want to hear more.   Meek Mill ft. Drake, ""R.I.C.O."": Sometimes it's nice to just have a seat and listen to some experts stunt, you know? ""R.I.C.O."" is about making so much money and living so lavishly that you have to dial it back just to evade federal investigation. Drake leans back with Toronto slang, token pettiness, and throwbacks to Shaq throwing up bricks at the free throw line; Meek raps through a wire tap and makes a show of counting his money for the benefit of teachers who didn't believe in him. This is braggadocio at its simplest and most satisfying.   Miguel, ""what's normal anyway"": I reviewed Miguel's new album Wildheart earlier this week. I didn't like it as much as many other critics out there, but I love this song without reservation. It's a vulnerable, tender beacon in the middle of an album that gets a little lost in its own psychedelic sex appeal.   Mocky, ""Upbeat Thing"": Mocky is a Canadian multi-instrumentalist and composer who's worked with everyone from Feist to Kelela. He released Key Change this week, his first solo album in over a half-decade. ""Upbeat Thing"" is its opener, and a good introduction to his unique brand of whimsy. It's summery and romantic, the kind of thing you want to hear leaking from a park bandstand when you happen to pass by.   Vince Staples ft. Snoh Aalegra, ""Jump Off the Roof"": If I was writing ""this week's most important albums,"" you can be damn sure Vince Staples' Summertime 06 would be included. It's lean, mean, and uncompromising, a double album with impressive economy anchored by a personality you can't ignore. The first thing that hits you on ""Jump Off the Roof"" is the beat, which you can feel in your bones. It's like someone's drumming on pots and pans they just stole from your kitchen. And then you hear Vince: fucked up on love and weed and coke, lonely and scared, trying to outrun his demons. The intensity is staggering. There's a whole album full of songs like this.   Wavves x Cloud Nothings, ""No Life for Me"": Let's end on a lighter note, relatively speaking: a straightforward thrasher from Wavves and Cloud Nothings, who slapped their collaborative full-length on Bandcamp and iTunes early this week. They've been working on it for a while, and this is the title track: no frills, just instruments played hard, fast, and well. It works for me.   That's it for me — here's this week's playlist. I hope your weekend is filled with soaring bald eagles, colorful fireworks, and juicy hot dogs — even if you're not American.

But sometimes, a “cinematic” game can truly capture the feeling of being inside an epic spectacle, and one of the best examples is the 2009 Batman: Arkham Asylum. Its stylish brawling and methodical stealth sequences required real skill, but the outsized rewards — a complicated array of gadgets and fighting moves that broke the laws of physics — made you feel like you were doing more than just pressing buttons. You were in a full-fledged martial arts battle (loosely) inspired by comic genius Grant Morrison, you controlled the outcome, and you looked great doing it. The sequel, Arkham City, gave players far more of the series’ best features. With a few design tweaks, it introduced the subtle but fascinating theme that Batman wasn’t just morally ambiguous; he was a complete monster. Like so many other open-world games, though, City struggled to balance a consistent story with the freedom to explore. Its setting was by turns delightfully open-ended and frustratingly overwhelming, eventually leaving players with no real motivation except collecting hundreds of trophies to complete 100 percent of the game. Last week, developer Rocksteady concluded its series with Batman: Arkham Knight. Arkham Knight introduces more structure into the huge world of Gotham. It introduces the Batmobile. It introduces a new enemy: the mysterious Arkham Knight, a masked man with a personal vendetta against Batman. And it is completely insane — narratively, mechanically, and thematically. We’re just lucky its madness is so much fun.  [I played about 97 percent of Arkham Knight over about 45 hours on the PlayStation 4; despite a couple of bugs, this proved an excellent decision. The catastrophically broken PC version did, however, spawn one pretty fantastic mod.] Arkham Knight’s story assumes a surprising amount of Batman lore knowledge, with dozens of characters showing up like old friends at a surprise birthday party. You remember Firefly, right? How could you forget your old pal, Professor Pyg?  While you’re busy trying to put names to faces, the game begins setting up the ideal Dark Knight playground: a bizarre place where everyone can be hurt and no one can die. A supervillain’s plot has driven out all of Gotham’s law-fearing residents, leaving only gang members, an Arkham Knight ""militia,"" and other people that you can beat up with impunity. The Knight is a huge fan of autonomous warfare, so you can have constant non-lethal drone fights. Most of the city is now equipped with convenient handles for the Batmobile’s winch, which Arkham Knight treats as a universal puzzle-solving tool. How will I extinguish this ironically burning firehouse? Winch! And what about this expensive puzzle constructed in the middle of a busy city? Oh right, winch. And these bombs that can only be solved by inserting a computer virus into their operating system, then detonating a small controlled explosion? Yes, somehow, winch. There’s not just more of everything from previous games, there’s a surprising range of completely new stuff. Batman has been equipped with a set of strangely specific tools, ranging from a voice synthesizer to a rifle-like device that jams guns and blocks tracking devices and places tracking devices and disables just about every other random piece of technology a goon might be using. It’s a gun that does everything but what guns do best: kill people. The Batmobile can lock into a ""battle mode"" that allows it to fire missiles and dodge drones, and the game occasionally throws you into what can only be described as tank stealth missions. Ironically, the tank battles — the most obviously un-Batman-like part of the game — are one of the best new additions. They’re like a 3D version of Space Invaders, with the Batmobile dodging missiles, luring drones into shooting each other, and deploying the occasional special move. It’s the closest thing I can imagine to a vehicular version of Arkham’s brawling system, and the Batmobile is actually far more mobile and responsive in battle mode, to the point where I sometimes shifted into it while driving. On the other hand, Arkham Knight’s puzzles distinctly suffer from the game’s feature-stuffing; they seem designed to awkwardly force players into using the Batmobile in far more tedious ways. (Again, this is a game in which ""Lucius! I need a way to track an ancient root system"" is a perfectly reasonable request.) And standard driving, easily the weakest and most generic feature, can’t simply be ignored. It clogs up a frustrating amount of the missions, particularly major story ones. But once you’re actually in the middle of a fight, or trying to pick off goons from a distance, the new gadgets are both useful and optional — you might lock off a box of guns before jumping into a group of unarmed enemies, or imitate a villain’s voice to get one of their goons in just the right place. They don’t break the flow that Rocksteady has perfected so well, they just make it more complex. Maintaining this flow has required an increasingly delicate balancing act between realism and fantasy. WB’s frankly bizarre ""Be the Batman"" advertising campaign (""Are you a 130-pound hipster who’s getting mugged? Just punch those guys out!"") did a terrible job of conveying why you should play Arkham Knight, because it relied on convincing people that there was any connection between its utter absurdity and real-life heroism. It’s not just that Batman pulls apart steel fuse boxes like he’s opening a soda can, or that he can take several bullets at close range and barely flinch. It’s that unless you let the game operate according to its own contrived, goofy, self-aware rules, it becomes horrific. From one angle, Arkham Knight is the world of Batman at its most brutally amoral. Batman threatens to torture people constantly, and Arkham brawling is peppered with limb-shattering cracks. There are new ""takedowns"" that knock thugs out with your car’s guns or let you beat them with bats and slam their heads into fuse boxes. From another, it’s an enjoyably silly and self-aware Tom and Jerry sketch. The game assures us that all of Batman’s deadly-sounding gadgets are non-lethal, down to the little jittery moans when you knock someone aside with the Batmobile’s electrified cow-catcher. The thugs themselves, whose conversations pop in and out as Batman flies around the city, provide strangely self-aware bits of levity. They’re a Greek chorus for the audience, alternately hopeless fanboys and snarky commentators. One minute you’ll be hearing them wax rhapsodic over how cool your tank looks, the next they’ll put forward an eminently reasonable theory about how Batman is a CIA-funded domestic operative recruited to circumvent due process, or point out that he never kills but seems just fine with near-fatal maiming. The whole thing produces both hilarity and complete tonal whiplash. It’s hard to get in a dramatic emotional confrontation with an old friend, break to run a few laps on Riddler’s neon-colored racetrack, and then threaten to crush a man’s head with your car tire without feeling like something’s a little wrong. That’s always been a problem with Batman, and with superheroes in general — they’re cultural archetypes who take on incredibly serious subjects with a veneer of unreality and cartoon logic. But it doesn’t help that the major quest writing is so surreally clumsy it sometimes seems to be intentionally mocking itself. When a character leads you on multiple identical chases in which he shouts the same half-dozen catchphrases over and over, and they’re all half-puns that would make Arnold Schwarzenegger’s Mr. Freeze roll his eyes — is it just a badly written quest? Or is it a commentary on how video game writing is more about giving mechanical feedback than crafting fine prose? A few of Arkham Knight’s side quests are gems, but the primary plot is full of heavy-handed cliches, down to the Arkham Knight himself — a character that was done more effectively in, of all things, Pixar’s The Incredibles. Arkham Knight’s female characters spend a troubling amount of time getting kidnapped, but that’s just a symptom of its larger problem, which is that almost literally everyone Batman knows becomes a damsel in distress. We get it. Batman can’t save everyone. Villains can only tie up so many friends, allies, lesser villains, and random bystanders before it starts seeming cheap. It’s a shame that the writing breaks down so often, because Rocksteady can mess with the actual mechanics to great narrative and cinematic effect. Throughout the series, side missions have let you play as other characters, but in Arkham Knight Batman tag-teams certain fights with characters like Catwoman, with players switching control of them at will. Instead of using cutscenes to show something happening that Batman can’t see, Arkham Knight sometimes jumps to another character’s point of view entirely. At one point, the game offhandedly suggests you perform an act of vigilantism that even other characters seem to think is a bridge too far. It turns out fine, but for a moment, you’re left wondering Arkham Knight has sent you down the wrong path — if you finally made Batman snap. Getting that ""100 percent"" marker in most games is just about trophies, but Arkham Knight uses it to parcel out its endings. Finishing the main story gets you a limited conclusion, completing a certain number of side quests gets you a larger one and the credits, and knocking out every single random quest and hidden trophy brings you something like a movie stinger. If you’re playing in a rush, this is miserable, but it actually gives the game a structure and momentum that’s lacking in Arkham City and open worlds in general. This is the Arkham series’ Bruce Wayne spending his final night in the cape and cowl. For once, completionism actually makes sense. While this surely isn’t the end of Batman games, Arkham Knight really does feel like the end of this particular story. Arkham combat has been adopted into other games, and Arkham Knight could provide its own share of influence (I’m looking especially hard at the tank combat here). But narratively, it’s gone about as far as the series can — and it did it with style.",0.5603010751641997,0.4396989248358003,0.16459345115263724,1711,5.1525423728813555,878,6.5535307517084282,0,0,"Culture, Entertainment, Gaming, Games Review",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

These items are unremarkable, except for this: I ordered them by pressing some buttons on or near my kitchen countertop. Online shopping — or we’ll-certainly-need-this-for-the-apocalypse impulse shopping — can now be done with a light press on a small, plastic ""Buy Me!"" dongle made by Amazon. There are a couple different ways to look at Amazon’s Dash Buttons. The first, and most obvious, is that they are a gimmick. There is something ludicrous about spending money to spend more money. At least, I felt this way when I went to Amazon.com and loaded up my virtual shopping cart with buttons, my total coming to $16.29 for three of them (each one costs $4.99, plus tax). This is it? I thought when the 3-inch dongles arrived a couple days later. Each one was housed in tiny cardboard, like Amazon boxes for the modern dollhouse. This is Amazon’s vision for the future of shopping? There are buttons for Bounty, and Smartwater, and Gillette, and Huggies, and Gatorade, and about a dozen other brands right now. These brands have reportedly paid Amazon real money to have their own plastic Dash Buttons. Every which way, Amazon is getting paid. There is something ludicrous about spending money to spend more money But these buy buttons also support a shopping experience that involves almost zero interaction, whether that means browsing store shelves (IRL!) or tapping a touchscreen to browse and buy virtually. Sure, when you first set up a Dash Button, you'll have to go into the Amazon mobile app. You'll select the specific batch of product you want to order and reorder, whether it’s a three-pack of scented Clorox disinfecting wipes scented for $9.97 or a six-pack of the citrus blend variety for $23.82. And when it comes to actually ""shopping""? You just press the Dash Button. A tiny light flickers white, until it turns green, indicating your order is on its way.   The notion that the best interface may be no interface is not a new one, but in an e-commerce scenario, it makes a surprising amount of sense. Even one-click purchasing requires opening an app or website. This does not. Dash Buttons are also not the first product from Amazon to embrace this idea. Prior to this there was another Dash stick, one that works with Amazon’s grocery delivery service in Manhattan. You could speak to this wand, say ""meat,"" and you would get meat. Echo, a new wireless speaker from Amazon, is a voice-controlled virtual assistant packed in a black cylinder, one that will dim the lights, set a timer or play a Saturday morning music playlist for you. While the Echo’s music picks aren’t always the greatest, there is something immensely convenient about not having to open an app and search for something. The greatest irony of ""smart"" products is that they can make you feel dumb while you’re scrolling through an app. Did I mention you can also buy things with the Echo? (You didn’t think Amazon would stray too far from that, did you?) ""Alexa,"" you can say to it, ""Reorder trash bags,"" and trash bags you shall receive. Dash Buttons are a way to shop without shopping The Dash Buttons, then, are another means to an end for Amazon. It’s a let’s-throw-these-at-the-wall-and-see-if-they-literally-stick attempt. To call these ""hardware"" would be a stretch, and it's not the hardware that really matters, anyway; it's getting you to buy stuff. For consumers, the Dash Buttons are a way to shop without shopping. It’s easy to forget that you’ve spent real money, until you get the standard email receipt from Amazon. ""Can I press one?"" three fully grown human beings asked me when they saw the Dash Buttons. Is it because they look like toys? Or because the idea of ordering something by simply pressing a button, as though it's a doorbell to an Amazon distribution warehouse, is just too tempting? ""I would prefer not to have 96 more Larabars show up at my front door,"" I would say, especially because the bars I ordered tasted more like an Amazon box and less like peanut butter and chocolate.  A doorbell to an Amazon distribution warehouse I asked Amazon what would happen if a child, or a pet, or a fully grown human being were to press a Dash Button multiple times. It turns out Dash Buttons only respond to the ""first press"" until your order has shipped and arrived. Also, if you’ve opted into notifications, you will know if someone has placed six orders of Larabars, and can cancel orders if necessary. There’s also the practical question of how often you’ll really use the Dash Buttons. Right now, I don’t plan to reorder the Larabars. Eighty trash bags should last me for awhile. So should three canisters of bleach wipes. Ideally, there would be more brands participating, or the buttons could be programmed to order different kinds of things. But Amazon, not surprisingly, seems to have grander plans for this. Its Dash Replenishment Service involves partnerships with appliance makers — like Whirlpool and Brita — that can either have physical buttons or built-in sensors that would trigger a new purchase. In this scenario, shopping isn’t just interface-free; it’s based on behavioral patterns, such as how often you run out of printer ink, or how frequently you replace the water filter. I did experience one glitch with Dash Buttons: I never got my Clorox bleach wipes. The order didn’t process after I first set up the Dash Button. Once I realized this, I walked into my kitchen and pressed the Clorox-branded Dash Button again. They should arrive by Thursday.",0.3795642240104308,0.6204357759895692,0.17491105427321377,964,4.8744813278008294,498,6.0502008032128511,0,2,"Tech, Report",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Last winter, the New York City Parks Department conducted an aerial, infrared survey of the island and found 793 individuals — an apparent 3,304 percent increase in just six years. Deer on the island have gone from a rarity to a delight to a problem with no immediate solution. ""I never saw a deer until I went away to college,"" Sam Immo, a 23-year-old Staten Island native, told me. ""When my friends and I were learning to drive, driving at night was a non-issue,"" she said. ""The first time I almost hit a deer, I was flabbergasted."" The consequences of white-tailed deer overabundance extend beyond trampled gardens, the spread of tick-borne disease, or even car collisions. (The Department of Sanitation had a contractor remove 34 ""large dead deer"" from Staten Island’s roads in 2013.) Too many deer will ruin an ecosystem for years to come, leaving forests barren; eventually, the deer’s insatiable appetite will lead to its own starvation. While Staten Island, New York City’s greenest borough, hasn’t quite reached that point, without management efforts in place, the island will get there soon enough. Under favorable conditions, deer populations can double every two to three years. Staten Island — an area just shy of 60 square miles — might expect its deer population to reach 3,000 by 2017. It’s a pattern that has unfolded across the American Northeast and Midwest over the past 30 years. White-tailed deer — once on the brink of extirpation in the United States — find refuge in the parks, backyards, and golf courses of suburban and exurban America. Humans are largely at fault: the way we develop things, with our fondness for cultivated, abrupt treelines, wide-open soccer fields, and the absence of hunters and predators are ideal for deer. As far as they are concerned, Staten Island — best views of the Manhattan skyline in the tri-state metropolitan area! — is as nice a place to live as any. Unmanaged, however, the population will become an increasingly expensive problem, with any semblance of balance difficult to restore. That one of New York City’s five boroughs will soon be overrun with hundred-pound pests (some with horns), at this point, seems inevitable. Three times larger than Manhattan, Staten Island is home to less than a third as many people — just over 472,000, according to the last census. The island is densely built up at its hilly northeastern end, where commuters board ferries bound for downtown New York City, a few miles away. But away from the city, sloping southwest towards New Jersey and southeast towards the Atlantic, the island becomes increasingly depopulated — a landscape of gutted factories, empty prisons, and parks. ""Nothing down here but the deer,"" John Caminiti told me as we drove in his car. Caminiti and his friends feed the deer at Staten Island’s Charleston Cemetery. Sometimes, he said, they eat out of his hand. Charleston Cemetery sits along the side of Arthur Kill Road at the southern end of Staten Island — just about as far from Manhattan you can get while still remaining within the confines of the five boroughs. Staten Island has some of the oldest cemeteries in New York state — legendary New Yorker writer Joseph Mitchell even wrote a story about them. ""The South Shore is the most rural part of the island,"" he wrote in 1956, ""and all these cemeteries are bordered on at least two sides by woods."" Today those woods and cemeteries are full of deer: during my visit at Charleston, a small fawn scampered toward a doe at the sight of me. Arthur Kill Road swings out and around the bottom of the island to the water of the Arthur Kill — a tidal strait separating Staten Island from New Jersey. (""Kill"" being a Dutch word for a stream or a creek or other such flowing body of water.) Many suspect that this is ground zero for the island’s exploding deer population: deer have been videotaped swimming across the Arthur Kill toward Staten Island from New Jersey towns like Rahway, Carteret, and Perth Amboy — places where sprawling industrial campuses, many abandoned, sit adjacent to marshes, forests, and swamps.  About a half-mile south of the giant mound of the Freshkills landfill, the coast is littered with scuttled ships, earning it the name Staten Island Ship Graveyard. At low tide, I walked across the flats — scattered oysters sticking up out of the mud, rusting hulls sticking up out of the water a little further out — to a heavily wooded peninsula that sticks out towards Jersey. The trek was not very rigorous, but it smelled bad. I saw no deer, but I saw deer shit. A lot of deer shit. Mike Feller, the recently retired chief naturalist for the Parks Department, told me that a large part of his mission as a nature advocate is to foster connections between green spaces that would otherwise be fragmented — or, as he put it, ""ameliorating island biogeography."" The Arthur Kills area is a good illustration, Feller said, of that project finding success: ""a glorious, contiguous system of forests, marshes, and edges."" This is exactly the kind of habitat that white-tailed deer enjoy. According to Caminiti, a deer (or a person) would be able to travel from the northernmost tip of the island to the southernmost without crossing more than four or five roads. ""Trying to make things more connected has a lot of benefits, but also a lot of liabilities. You can’t filter out the species you may not want,"" Feller told me. ""Before, maybe there were outliers, stragglers, but no herds,"" he said. (A New York Times article from 1953 tells the story of a Staten Island farmer being gored by one such buck.) ""There was a time it seemed like the deer just showed up."" After leaving Arthur Kill, I drove back to the cemetery in hopes of catching one more glimpse of a deer before the sunset. Sure enough, there she was, a doe, staring me down from between the mossy headstones. And then she turned, bounding away unhurriedly into the dim evening woods. White-tailed deer are not particularly large animals, but they are muscular and athletic, some reportedly able to jump over fences 10 feet high. The tails from which they derive their name stick up jauntily over their rears as they run away from you. Before European colonization, North America was home to somewhere between 24 and 33 million white-tailed deer, most widely distributed east of the Rocky Mountains. In the following centuries, that population was destroyed — first by traders operating out of coastal cities, making deals with Native Americans for pelts; then by settlers moving out West. Deer died by the hundreds of thousands as the market grew for their meat and hides. But it was the the second half of the 19th century that truly decimated animal populations across the United States. In his book Nature Wars, wildlife historian, journalist, and hunter Jim Sterba writes, ""All wildlife suffered, from bison to songbirds. Demand for wild products soared as immigrants poured in and the US population grew to 76 million. Any wild species with any value was killed for meat, fur, or feathers."" The white-tailed population plummeted to an estimated low of 350,000 animals in 1890. According to Serba, ""by the end of the 19th century white-tailed deer were so scarce that market hunters no longer bothered with them."" Then, thanks to a set of concepts and policies referred to as the North American Model of Wildlife Conservation, the deer made a tremendous comeback. The model, encouraged by a rising American bourgeoisie that yearned for recreational hunting, established a series of principles to promote rebounding deer populations: create protected green spaces where commercial hunting was banned; foster safe and abundant spaces for regulated, recreational hunting; and further discourage predator species that had essentially already been eradicated. The logic was simple: you can’t hunt the deer if all the deer are already dead. As a result, the United States now has over 30 million white-tailed deer, much more densely populated than they ever were before Europeans arrived. Unchecked by wolves, cougars, and bears, the herds wreak havoc: a 2012 Rutgers University study alleges that white-tailed deer are responsible for most of the $4.5 billion worth of crops that US agriculture loses to wildlife annually; they account for three to four thousand car collisions a day. New Jersey alone had 31,192 deer collisions from 2011 to 2012. Unchecked by predators or hunters, only starvation will limit population growth. To bring a native species back from the brink of eradication should be cause for celebration — in this respect, the revival of white-tailed deer is one of the conservation movement’s finest accomplishments. But our understanding of what is best for the deer, for people, and for the wider ecosystem is, perhaps, changing. And success is starting to resemble failure. To combat Staten Island’s deer, New York City has pulled together 22 people into a newly organized NYC Interagency Deer Management Task Force. Representatives from the Environmental Conservation are present, but so are employees of the Department of Transportation, Sanitation, Emergency Management, NYPD, USDA, and others. The task force, chaired by the Parks Department’s director of conservation Kevin Heatley, had its first official meeting this past December. There, the team came to two conclusions: The deer are a problem. The city needs to do something about the deer. ""It’s not the number of deer, it’s the density,"" Heatley told me. At 41 deer per square mile of Staten Island, he said, ""The numbers are four times as high as we’d like them to be."" The task force will aim to lower that density to fewer than 15 animals per square mile. But no one can agree on when this will happen, or how. The task force has three priorities: monitor the animals and their impact; educate the public about deer behavior; and manage the population. It is this last goal that’s the most difficult and controversial. Communities like Staten Island — largely developed, if not entirely urban, with plenty of green space — have essentially four primary management methods available to them: two lethal and two non-lethal. Lethal methods include regulated culls (i.e. hiring government sharpshooters) and recreational hunting. Non-lethal methods include the application of a contraceptive and surgical sterilization. The fifth option — which isn’t really an option but rather the current state of affairs — is to do nothing at all. ""Pursuing, shooting, killing, or capturing"" as well as ""disturbing, harrying, or worrying"" wildlife is prohibited in all five boroughs of New York City and carries a penalty of a year in jail, a $2,000 fine, or both. That hasn’t stopped some: In 2007, The New York Times reported hunters roaming Staten Island’s Clay Pit Pond State Park. Margherita Grancio-Rubertone lives near Freshkills Park, across the street from a cemetery where a deer was once found impaled on the fence (the victim of an unfortunate jumping accident). ""It’s not a good idea, hunting,"" she told me. ""To just come up and start killing them seems cruel. They’re innocent — they don’t know."" The relative density of Staten Island would also make hunting difficult, or at least uncomfortable. ""It would be pretty dangerous, with the deer right across from your house,"" Grancio-Rubertone said. ""God forbid, whatever might happen."" In February of 2013, a Staten Island Advance reporter asked Republican mayoral candidate Joe Lhota, a former head of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority who hunts deer in upstate New York, what he made of the growing deer sightings on Staten Island. Lhota was in town to pick up an assemblyman’s endorsement. ""The next mayor is going to have to figure out how hunting is going to work,"" Lhota said, adding that if hunting were to be permitted on the island, it would have to be bowhunting. ""Not everybody believes in hunting,"" Lhota said. ""So we need to have a public debate."" Lhota later denied making the comments; the Advance reporter stuck by his story, and the paper ended up running an editorial condemning the idea of allowing hunting in the borough anyway. The task force does not consider hunting to be a viable option for Staten Island, and just as well — recreational hunting on its own has been found to be an insufficient means of population control. One study even found that bowhunters in New Jersey and Pennsylvania who were permitted unlimited tags, could shoot deer over bait, and were working during extended seasons still could not reduce the size of deer herds to sustainable levels. One of the study’s co-authors was Anthony DeNicola, founder of a non-profit called White Buffalo, which provides wildlife control services using lethal and nonlethal methods. DeNicola’s doctoral dissertation at Purdue University was on deer contraceptives; he claims to have killed more than 10,000 deer since he founded White Buffalo in 1995. ""People have a hard time accepting ‘responsibility’ for taking an animal’s life, but at what cost to the animal’s quality of life?"" he asked when we spoke. Communities hire White Buffalo to manage their wildlife when that wildlife has run amok. DeNicola is not optimistic that the residents of Staten Island or legislators in a city like New York are going to accept widespread lethal deer culls. ""When you’re dealing with people who live in the New York metropolitan area, they have no day-to-day exposure to nature, to living with nature. The idea of killing animals like deer has a very visceral impact,"" DeNicola said. ""Given the degree of urbanization, your ability to educate, to sway public perception becomes very hard — to get people to understand the need to cull? Good luck. Ideally, you’d pursue an integrated solution"" — a mix of lethal and non-lethal methods. ""Practically? Not. Gonna. Happen."" White Buffalo has experimented with surgical sterilization, which DeNicola believes will play a greater role in deer management as time goes on. ""Most locations that have deer problems have firearm restrictions,"" he observed. ""The data keep reinforcing that sterilization may have some utility."" But labor-intensive sterilization is an expensive proposition: you have to catch the deer, and you need someone who is competent in the surgical sterilization process available to perform the act — the bill comes out to around $1,000 per doe. ""Tony’s been doing a lot of the surgical sterilization work, and he has a great team to do that,"" Allen Rutberg, director of Tufts University’s Center for Animals and Public Policy, told me. ""I just don’t think that his team can be replicated in an efficient manner."" Rutberg is researching a different non-lethal method of deer management: immunocontraception, or birth control. Last year, he and his team began an experiment with this method in the town of Hastings-on-Hudson, just north of New York City in Westchester County. Hastings, a two-square-mile area, is estimated to be home to around 120 deer; there were 16 car collisions involving deer here in 2011, and the mayor, his wife, and their child all contracted deer-borne Lyme disease. Rutberg’s method involves tranquilizing, tagging, and applying the vaccine to each deer once every two years; similar experiments on Fire Island reduced deer populations in some areas by as much as 50 percent. Rutberg’s contraceptive method costs around $500 per deer, though he argues that if government regulations requiring him to tag each deer were lifted, he could bring that cost down to $100. One of the things we like about the sort of contraception that we do is that it seems to be a sort of comfortable, consensus solution,"" Rutberg said. ""It doesn’t involve killing anything, it’s not too invasive, we don’t have to do surgery on the animals, but at the same time it keeps the problem under control. It seems like a nice compromise between treating them as pests and treating them as pets and treating them as nature’s gift."" But building a consensus in any community can be a laborious process, especially in a place with as many stakeholders and interest groups as New York City. ""A consensus-based approach is never going to work on a controversial issue,"" DeNicola told me. ""You can try educating, but in the time it takes to do that you’ll have deer up to your eyeballs."" The best case scenario for Staten Island, he said, is that five years from now a management method will be agreed on. ""Meanwhile, the forest is denuded, Lyme disease spreads, and collisions increase,"" he said. ""The deer are happy!"" But as for the city? ""They are well on their way to a major headache."" Heatley, the head of the NYC Interagency Deer Management Task Force, shares DeNicola’s concern — whatever method the city decides on, time is of the essence if Staten Island is going to solve its deer problem. ""When your house is on fire, you go get a bucket. You don’t measure the temperature of the flames,"" he told me. ""The deer situation is a wildfire."" Deer aren’t the only animals adapting and flourishing in the landscapes we’ve created: in 1974, only 325 pairs of peregrine falcons were left in all of North America. Today they thrive in cities, whose skylines imitate the falcon’s ancestral habitats along cliffs and canyons: the New York State DEC reports that peregrine falcons nest on every bridge over the Hudson River south of Albany. The world’s largest urban bat colony numbering around 1.5 million — is located underneath downtown Austin’s Congress Avenue Bridge. A wolf-coyote hybrid is spreading through the Northeast from above the Great Lakes, via the Appalachians — its size and weight making it a more fearsome predator than its pure-coyote predecessors. Some 2,000 coyotes have moved from the suburbs around Chicago into the city’s downtown, and coyotes from Westchester County — just north of Manhattan — have made it as far south as TriBeCa. Just a few days ago, one was caught on the Upper West Side. The distinction between nature and civilization has always been a delusional abstraction at best, and a justification for the exploitation of natural resources at worst. We are, at all times, amongst nature, and it is amongst us whether we see it or not. And now the deer, the coyotes, and others are coming back to remind us of the fact. ""Humans have forgotten that they have a role in nature,"" the Department of Agriculture Forest Service’s Thomas Rawinski told me. ""We have to take responsibility for the problem, we have to look at ourselves as part of this ecosystem."" Human beings shattered the landscape of this continent, only to decide that we preferred it the other way. But putting the puzzle back together is proving to be harder than we imagined. On Staten Island, that shattered landscape isn’t just made up of deer: the island is also struggling with a flock of wild turkeys. For the past 15 years, the birds have made the campus of the South Beach Psychiatric Center their home. It all started with nine captive-bred birds that were released onto hospital grounds in 2000. Since then, the flock has grown. Meanwhile, the turkey’s fecal matter is tracked into the hospital buildings, Ben Rosen, a spokesperson for the Office of Mental Health, told me. The birds are obstructing emergency vehicles making their way in and out of the hospital. In August 2013, several turkeys were captured by hand and with nets, placed into crates, and shipped to a ""state-approved processing facility,"" according to a statement given at the time by a USDA spokesperson to the Staten Island Advance. Their meat was to be frozen and its suitability for human consumption tested. But the cull sparked a public outrage and was officially halted in September; an estimated 45 turkeys remained on the psych ward grounds. The DEC made accommodations for 28 of the birds to be transported to an enclosed space at the Catskill Environmental Sanctuary instead. The USDA, which is now handling the relocation process, is employing several different capture methodologies — pre-baited walk-in traps, weighted nets that are launched over turkeys by air cannons, and hand nets — over short periods of time to prevent the turkeys from catching on and finding other places to roost. It’s taken New York City 15 years to address the chaos caused by nine turkeys. One shudders to think how long it will take the city to tackle a population of 800 furiously procreating deer. DeNicola laughed when I told him about the island’s turkey troubles. Getting rid of turkeys is easy, he scoffed. Deer are another case altogether. ""You’re not gonna relocate deer,"" he told me with a smirk in his voice. ""You’re stuck with the deer. You handle them there."" Correction: The territory of Staten Island encompasses less than 60 square miles, not 100. That makes it the third largest borough in New York City.

The CPU in New Horizons may have been tweaked a little to better survive the radiation bombardment of space, but other than that it's the same old chip: NASA’s engineers don’t need power; they need reliability. This is why there’s nothing better than a reputation staked on years of commercial use. Is your old PlayStation still working? Good. Because New Horizon has been in space for nine years already.

The same can’t be said for the rest of the world, as global investment in biomedical research actually increased during that same period, according to a study published today in the Journal of the American Medical Association. The US is ""at risk of losing its global scientific leadership and competitiveness."" ""The United States is at risk of losing its global scientific leadership and competitiveness,"" write Victor Dzau and Harvey Fineberg, current and past presidents of the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies in Washington, DC, in an editorial also published today in the Journal of the American Medical Association. ""One indicator after another demonstrates numerous other countries outpacing the United States in their commitment to research."" In the study, Moses and his team used publicly available data to understand patterns in global medical research investment between 1994 and 2012. They found that the rate of research investment growth increased by 6 percent per year in the US between 1994 and 2004. But between 2004 and 2012, the amount of money for research decreased by 0.8 percent a year — as the US's global contribution to biomedical research dollars dropped to 44 percent in 2012, from 57 percent in 2004. And while the US was cutting its medical research investments, Asian countries increased their global investment by 7 percent. The decline in medical research funding in the US has largely hurt early-stage research, specially ""proof-of-concept research,"" which demonstrates the feasibility and usefulness of a treatment after its discovery. Instead of ensuring that medical discoveries make it to later stages in medical research, funding has gone toward developing medical devices and late-stage clinical trials. This means that some discoveries never get to move ahead, because there's no money to make it happen. ""The diseases where the need is greatest... have been relatively underfunded."" The study also reveals an imbalance in the types of diseases that receive funding. The amount of money that goes toward cancer and HIV/AIDS research, for instance, is greater than the predicted burden associated with these diseases. ""The diseases where the need is greatest — autism, depression, Alzheimer’s, Type 2 diabetes — are diseases that have been relatively underfunded compared to cancer and HIV/AIDS,"" says Hamilton Moses, a co-author of the study and the chairman of Alerion Advisors, a consulting group. Patents and copyrights in the US are also in decline. For example, the US contributed 57 percent of the world's life science patents in 1981, and now contributes 51 percent. And of the patents considered most valuable, the US contributed 73 percent in 1981. In 2011, however, that number was 59 percent. ""We view this as a cloud on the horizon,"" Moses says. ""As Asia and other countries patent more and the quality of those patents are greater, the threat to the US supremacy is real."" The reasons for the decline in medical research aren’t straightforward. Part of it has to do with a change in the investment landscape, where industry has taken to funding projects that yield results over short periods of time. ""The investor worldwide has become impatient."" Moses says. ""As a result, the markets have rewarded short-term performance, and that means that a marketing dollar goes further than a science dollar."" But a bigger part of the reason lies in economic downturns that occurred in the early 2000s, as well as in enhanced interest in international security following 9/11. ""When the US federal government runs deficits, biomedical research is de-emphasized,"" Moses says.  And although this may seem intuitively correct, ""you would hope to see that trend reversed — investment in science and tech is a very good economic investment."" ""Asia knows that biomedical research is a vehicle for them to enhance their international stature."" The good news, Moses says, is that it is possible to have a huge impact by changing research priorities. For a long time, Ebola wasn’t viewed as a threat, and therefore received very little funding. But now that the world has taken notice of the disease, advancements are happening quickly. And although we still don’t have a vaccine, many trials are currently underway. ""The machinery of research and development can move very effectively and you can get to new vaccines and new treatments rather quickly,"" he says. Thus, making changes in the way government and industry invests in medical research could potentially have a large impact on people's lives — even over short periods. ""That’s why Asia is investing; Asia knows that biomedical research is a vehicle for them to enhance their international stature and the growth of their own populations,"" Moses says. If the US wants to ensure that the health of its citizens is taken care of in the future, or that research in the country won’t be hindered by non-US patents, ""the US needs to increase spending in biomedical research,"" and ""investment in health services research.""",0.5181596267452744,0.4818403732547256,0.9004287749944195,831,5.2442839951865219,405,6.4987654320987653,0,0,"Science, US & World, Report",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

In 2013, a group of researchers created enough muscle to make a burger that they could eat. But until recently, researchers weren't able to grow muscle that could contract in response to an external stimuli. Now, researchers at Duke University are reporting that they have successfully grown contracting muscle in the lab. The finding, a bioengineering first, means that we may finally be able to engineer muscle that not only looks and feels like real muscle, but that acts like it, too. It took a year to develop the right ""recipe"" To grow contracting muscle in the lab, the researchers started out with a sample of human muscle cell precursors. Then, they expanded the cells and placed them on 3D scaffolding filled with a nourishing gel. According to the researchers, it took a year to develop the right ""recipe,"" but eventually they figured it out: when the researchers subjected the lab-grown muscle to electrical stimuli, it contracted. Moreover, the researchers were able to show that the nerve signaling pathways in the muscle were functional. Being able to create muscle in a lab that can mimic normal muscle behavior is a big step for medicine. Doctors may soon be able to use this technology to accurately predict the effect of various drugs on the human body, without putting anyone in danger. Furthermore, researchers might one day be able to use biopsied cells to grow muscle that can be used to tailor treatments to individual patients. ""we could take one skin or blood sample and never have to bother the patient again."" The researchers have already demonstrated that the lab-grown muscle's response to cholesterol and performance enhancement drugs matches that of regular human muscle. They now plan to delve more deeply into the effects of various drugs on the muscle. Eventually, they would like to find a way to grow the muscle from stem cells, instead of biopsied cells. ""There are a some diseases, like Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy for example, that make taking muscle biopsies difficult,"" Nenad Bursac, study co-author and Duke University biomedical engineer, said in a press release. ""If we could grow working, testable muscles from induced pluripotent stem cells, we could take one skin or blood sample and never have to bother the patient again.""
