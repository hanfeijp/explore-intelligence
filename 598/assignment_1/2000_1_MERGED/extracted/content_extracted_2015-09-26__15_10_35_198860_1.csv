The company could be fined up to 10 percent of its yearly earnings or as much as $6 billion. The EU also announced today that it was launching a further investigation into the Android operating system which could result in additional fines. ""In the case of Google I am concerned that the company has given an unfair advantage to its own comparison shopping service, in breach of EU antitrust rules,"" said EU competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager. ""Google now has the opportunity to convince the Commission to the contrary. However, if the investigation confirmed our concerns, Google would have to face the legal consequences and change the way it does business in Europe.""   The EU is accusing Google of a number of unfair practices, as outlined in its statement of objections. These include prominently displaying its shopping service in search results ""irrespective of its merits,"" and lowering the search rank of rival services. The EU notes that this conduct began in 2008, and that Google's first comparison shopping service, Froogle, was not given this favorable treatment and subsequently ""performed poorly."" In a press conference, Vestager presented the charges as not a case of the EU attacking the US. She noted that one in four of the complainants were themselves American companies, and praised Google for the utility of its services. ""We do not wish to interfere with screen design … or with how the algorithm works,"" said Vestager. ""Rather, what we would like to see is that consumers are certain to see the best comparison shopping results."" Google's fines could be the biggest since Microsoft was ordered to pay $1.7 billion The case against Google is the biggest since the EU's 10-year battle with Microsoft which ended in 2004. Microsoft was eventually ordered to pay more than $1.7 billion — the largest fine handed out by the EU since a $1.4 billion ruling against Intel. Google nearly settled the case without back in 2013, but attitudes hardened later in the year, with the then EU competition commissioner deeming the proposal unacceptable on Spanish radio. In response to the charges, Google published a blog post detailing instances where its attempts to launch new products have essentially failed. The company points out that its flight-booking service, Google Flight Search, has barely made a dent in the US and European markets, and its shopping comparison service (the target of the EU's ire) doesn't appear to have adversely affected Amazon's dominance of online shopping. ""Any economist would say that you typically do not see a ton of innovation, new entrants or investment in sectors where competition is stagnating — or dominated by one player. Yet that is exactly what’s happening in our world,"" writes Amit Singhal, senior vice president of Google Search.

In 2014, digital revenue grew nearly 7 percent to $6.85 billion, while physical sales — of which CDs make up the vast majority — fell 8 percent to $6.82 billion. These figures, from a report from the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI), also reflect the growing popularity of digital music streaming, with revenue from services like Spotify growing 40 percent to $1.57 billion. downloads still account for 52% of digital revenue However, despite the increased popularity of streaming music, downloads still accounted for 52 percent of digital revenue — even though the format showed declining sales, falling 8 percent in all established markets. Despite these fluctuations, however, the industry as a whole is relatively stable, with overall revenue falling just 0.4 percent to $14.97 billion for the year 2014. (For historical comparisons, this is down from a peak of $40 billion in 1999.) The report by the IFPI also shows just how varied the markets for music sales can be. Despite the rise of digital, for example, many countries still prefer physical formats. In Japan, 78 precent of the music industry's revenue comes from CDs and the like; in Germany the figure is 70 percent, and in France it's 57 percent. By comparison, some countries have overwhelmingly moved from downloading music to streaming it, with nations like Sweden — the home of Spotify — generating 92 percent of its digital revenue from subscriptions.   In a press call for the report, industry execs also acknowledged the current tension between artists backing paid-only streaming services and free, ad-supported models. According to a report by The Wall Street Journal, Sony Music International CEO Edgar Berger said on a press call that there was ""no doubt that paid subscription will be the predominant format."" However, the report itself showed that customers currently prefer getting their music for free.

The Times says it has obtained a December 2012 letter from Rep. Darrell Issa (R-CA), then chair of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. In the letter, Issa asks whether Clinton or any other senior official at the State Department used a personal email address for official business, and if so, whether the agency had requirements for turning over documentation of work messages sent through personal accounts. According to the Times, the State Department wrote back in March of 2013, shortly after Clinton had left office. As Issa had requested, the department provided a description of its email policies, which said that anyone using a personal account ""should make it clear that his or her personal email is not being used for official business."" The department reportedly did not answer Issa's question about Clinton or any other senior official's accounts. In March, the Times broke news that Clinton has used a single account for both work and personal email, storing mail on a private server. This could potentially stop government watchdogs from reviewing how Clinton conducted business, since any non-classified official messages are supposed to be preserved and available for public review. Clinton acknowledged that she had used a private account, characterizing it as a matter of convenience that was widely known inside the agency. She said that any messages sent to other State Department employees would have been preserved on their end, and that she later sent roughly half of the server's 60,000 messages (roughly 55,000 pages of email, according to the Times) to the agency for record-keeping, culling out only purely personal emails. The 2012 letter was part of a broad investigation of several Obama administration agencies by Issa. One concerned a prominent Environmental Protection Agency official who was found using a second, pseudonymous government account, something that prompted an internal EPA audit. Issa was particularly critical of Clinton and the State Department after the death of US diplomats in Benghazi, Libya, alleging that officials were covering up mistakes in the government's response. Besides the EPA and State Department, he's also targeted emails related to insurance site Healthcare.gov's unstable rollout, accusing one official of deliberately deleting messages relating to the problems behind its launch.",0.27066154672006737,0.7293384532799326,0.8937708558658976,401,5.4039900249376558,237,6.2700421940928273,0,0,"Policy & Law, US & World"

Even though the Australian broadband landscape is different than that of the US, with many ISPs imposing highly prohibitive data caps on its users, we called out Netflix for boasting about the exemption. Today in an earnings statement, Netflix expressed regret about participating in data cap schemes. Here's what Netflix had to say: Data caps inhibit internet innovation and are bad for consumers. In Australia, we recently sought to protect our new members from data caps by participating in ISP programs that, while common in Australia, effectively condone discrimination among video services (some capped, some not). We should have avoided that and will avoid it going forward. Fortunately, most fixed-line ISPs are raising or eliminating data caps in line with our belief that ISPs should provide great video for all services in a market and let consumers do the choosing.

Netflix also reiterated its stance on ""strong net neutrality"" today, as it has in other recent earnings statements. As usual, the company prefers to bundle interconnection points in with more commonly understood ""last mile"" net neutrality concerns.

He's also a musician and a producer and a creator. We go beyond the normal boundaries that rappers want to sleep themselves stuck in. We've been fighting those rules from day one.

Pick a major artist who's put out music lately, no matter their label status or musical style, and they're likely represented somewhere: from Kanye and Rihanna to the Chemical Brothers and FKA twigs, you're bound to see something you like within the dense thicket of nominations. That kind of breadth is nice, but this year's most interesting battle happens to be taking place in the night's marquee category. That's Video of the Year, where viewers are going to have to figure out their allegiances along lines of genre, production value, and personal strategy. (If that sounds complicated, that's because it is — whoever said pop fandom was easy?) Let's take a look at our five nominees and break down both the merit of their candidacies and the paths they'll take to victory.   Beyoncé, ""7/11"": At this point, doesn't it feel like Beyoncé has transcended the VMAs? MTV gave her the highest honor they've yet managed to invent last year, and let her perform for 20 uninterrupted minutes; she announced that she was having her first child during the ceremony four years ago, rubbing her belly for the world's benefit. Winning another Video of the Year trophy at this point would be like adding a tiny candle to a three-story, 50-layer wedding cake. ""7/11"" is a lot of fun, and it boosted sales of kale-themed sweatshirts by several thousand percent, but it doesn't further any sort of career narrative other than, ""Beyoncé is still great! And more chill than you thought!"" I don't know if that's enough. Path to glory: One word: #BeyHive. Can't you see those ballot boxes getting flooded even if there isn't a ton of momentum behind this song?   Ed Sheeran, ""Thinking Out Loud"": This is probably the closest thing this category has to a rock song, though it's closer to Van Morrison's earthy, blue-eyed soul than anything you would traditionally associate with rock radio. Its biggest problem is that when talking about ""Thinking Out Loud,"" no one ever says anything like, ""Oh yeah — that's the one with the gorgeous video, the one with all the dancing."" (The question of whether or not people are still talking about ""Thinking Out Loud"" at all can be addressed another time.) To win Video of the Year, a song needs to be inseparable from its clip. It should render the song more vibrant, and it should pop into your brain every time you hear it. I don't think that's true for ""Thinking Out Loud."" Path to glory: The song's multigenerational appeal for romantics from 8 to 80 might draw in some bored parents to the VMA voting page, causing a very sweet, sincere upset from outside MTV's typical demo.   Kendrick Lamar, ""Alright"": This is the most ambitious and breathtaking video of the bunch, and it's the only one with any interest in any kind of broader social relevance.  It's also our sole entrant from the world of hip-hop this year. (Pour one out for Drake and Nicki Minaj — we'll talk about the latter in a minute.) I think the fact that ""Alright"" is commenting on something bigger than its own existence — police brutality, institutional racism, taking solace in community — is its greatest asset as a candidate, especially in a year where its category rivals are focused on having fun. Here's a scenario I can see evolving over the next few weeks: groups of Twitter and Tumblr users intensely interested in both music and social justice, banding together and driving an organic campaign for an ""Alright"" victory. The VMAs are a frivolous affair all around, sure, but wouldn't that be a nice moment of validation? And I bet we'd get one hell of a speech from Kendrick. Path to glory: ""Alright"" mobilizes a politically passionate base and rides a wave of appreciation for its sheer artistic audacity.   Mark Ronson ft. Bruno Mars, ""Uptown Funk"": Okay, this is my favorite of the bunch: it's pure fun, it oozes personality and color and wit, and it understands the unique skills of one Bruno Mars as an entertainer / force of nature. Unfortunately, it has to work against three major factors: fatigue, timing, and star power. ""Uptown Funk"" ruled the charts for a long time, and that reign took place at the wrong time in terms of VMA momentum. I love this song, and I still catch myself groaning when I hear it out and about just from having been drowned in it from January to April. And though Bruno is the face and voice of the track, Mark Ronson isn't the kind of name that drives voters to the virtual polls, especially up against people like Beyoncé and Taylor Swift. Path to glory: Everyone remembers how they felt the first time they heard this song six months ago and votes for that feeling. Prince shows up to accept the award, and nobody complains because ""Uptown Funk"" is basically a Prince song in the first place.   Taylor Swift ft. Kendrick Lamar, ""Bad Blood"": Let's acknowledge off the top that ""Blank Space"" is superior to ""Bad Blood"" in every way, and it's criminal that an endless parade of celebrities was enough to win this a nod over a better song and a better video. Moving on: I admit that I have a hyper-specific vision for how this category is going to play out come August, and it has a lot to do with the second half of Mean Girls. Having misread Nicki Minaj's systemic complaints about the VMA nomination process and inserted herself into the story — thus obscuring Nicki's point entirely — on Twitter last night, Taylor has realized her destiny as pop's Cady Herron. She's the girl who once thought of herself as an outsider, having become the thing she claimed to hate: a manipulator, a paranoid ruler. Path to glory: Taylor begins to realize the error of her ways, but the sheer force of the star power she's built up is too strong: she wins Video of the Year. She steps onto the VMA stage and looks out at the crowd. Instead of celebrating her win, she takes the opportunity to dismantle the concept entirely: she rails against the entrenched discrimination of the nomination process, the frivolousness of the whole charade. She breaks her Moonman into tiny pieces and gives them to Nicki, Katy Perry, and all of the other nominees. Calvin Harris graduates and attends Northwestern in the fall. Unfortunately, you'll have to wait a while to find out the true victor: the Miley Cyrus-hosted VMAs are set to air August 30th on MTV.",0.6300705465367167,0.3699294534632833,0.1534011091644464,1140,4.6728070175438594,621,5.8534621578099841,0,0,"Culture, Entertainment, Music"

It’s nowhere more obvious than in our movies, with some of the most (Jurassic World) and least (Terminator Genisys) successful films of the summer betting squarely on people’s love for looking backward.  Joining the chorus is the new Adam Sandler comedy Pixels. It’s been sold as a playful callback to arcade games of old, in which a team of video game experts are called upon to save the world when an alien race starts attacking Earth with creatures from ‘80s gaming classics. It’s such a bizarre set-up that before I saw it I started wondering if there wasn’t some other element that hadn’t yet been revealed. Nobody would actually make this movie unless there was a clever reversal or inspired twist, would they? There had to be something… right?  Anyone? To begin with — and this is going to tell you a little bit about how terrible movies get made — Pixels began life as a short film. Patrick Jean released his movie in 2010, and the premise was nice and clean: somebody puts an old television out on the curb in New York, and magically, 8-bit computer graphics begin pouring out of the screen. Pac-Man, Donkey Kong, Frogger: all of the original arcade hits start rampaging through Manhattan, turning everything they touch into pixelated blocks. Eventually an 8-bit bomb goes off, sending shockwaves throughout the city, and turning our planet itself into one massive, three-dimensional pixel. As a metaphor it wasn’t exactly subtle, but it did exactly what a two-and-a-half-minute short should do: successfully execute a clever visual idea while giving the audience something to chew on. Adam Sandler’s production company, however, seemed to see feature film greatness in Jean’s movie, and snatched up the rights. Run the concept through the Sandler Movie Factory, and you get what’s hitting theaters now. Sandler plays Sam Brenner, whose life was ruined as a teenager when he lost the 1982 worldwide arcade game championship. Cut to the present day, and he’s a Geek Squad-style TV installation guy who just happens to be best friends with the president of the United States (Kevin James, and no, I am not making this up). When a military base is attacked by huge creatures that look just like Galaga, Brenner is called to the White House to consult, and after teaming up with their other childhood friend Ludlow (Josh Gad), Brenner and the president realize what’s going on. An alien race has misinterpreted video game footage sent into space 30 years ago as a declaration of war, and has sent physical versions of those games to destroy humanity — and only Brenner and his team of misfits arcade gamers can save us. As executed, it’s like Contact meets Armageddon meets sticking knives into my eyes, but what’s most frustrating is that, philosophically, the concept is actually intriguing. There’s something about the idea of our own recycled pop culture coming back to do us in that feels timely and unique, a meta commentary on the sad state of reboots and ultra-franchised everything. But that would require some daring, or at least some basic situational awareness, and Pixels can’t be bothered with either. Instead, it’s the kind of movie that’s emotionally tone-deaf enough to expect us to root for a hero that puts the moves on a recently split single mom while she’s drunk and crying (in her bedroom closet, no less), and thinks that leaving awkward empty pauses after random lines is the same thing as making a joke. And did I mention the gag about Q*bert peeing himself? Now, if you’re one of the straggling Sandler defenders, let me clarify that I like dumb comedies. I even like many of Sandler’s dumb comedies. The actor hit upon a winning formula in the late ‘90s: take cookie-cutter story structure, plug in Sandler playing an idiot version of some common character, and let stupid things happen. It was fun, breezy, and it worked, and in odd cases like The Wedding Singer it worked so well that the movies actually seemed kind of, well, good. But even the most devoted fan will have to admit that in recent years Sandler’s been coasting (Grown Ups) if not flailing (That’s My Boy), and with Sony Pictures execs feeling increased animosity toward the star, it’s no surprise that he’s moving away from theatrical movies altogether. But that’s not really the solution for him or audiences. One of the biggest problems with Hollywood is its slavish devotion to repeatable success — or more specifically, the illusion of repeatable success. If a formula worked once, studios are happy to cede control and crank it out again and again, even when it’s clear things are no longer working. And when you’re talking about a star whose very brand is built upon the idea of not giving a shit, you end up with Pixels — and the middle finger once directed at the establishment ends up aimed right at audiences instead. If Netflix is creatively blank-checking Sandler, none of that is is going to change — but at least he’s moving to a place where he won’t have to worry about critical or commercial failure. I do wonder, though, what would an alien race, monitoring our movies and television, think of a planet that puts out something like Pixels as mass entertainment? Would they consider it a declaration of cultural war? Would they send emissaries down to smite us, wiping the slate clean — and would we deserve it? Pixels opens on Friday, July 24th.

Films like Whatever Works, Magic In The Moonlight, and From Rome With Love are arch but not particularly funny, and straight-faced but not particularly serious. They're packed with philosophical quotations, references, and blather, but seem to lack an actual philosophy. There's a sense that Allen isn't playing tongue-in-cheek, so much as wedging his tongue randomly and experimentally into every other cranial orifice, just to see what happens. That mixture of self-importance and self-dismissing fluff is particularly pronounced in Allen's latest film, the grating shaggy-dog story Irrational Man. The film seems divided against itself on a fundamental level: it announces its lack of sympathies with protagonist Abe Lucas in its title, then throws all its narrative sympathy in Abe's direction. Some critics have read the movie as reflecting Allen's public fight with adopted daughter Dylan Farrow in 2014, with The New York Times as forum and intermediary. Irrational Man has been read as the latest salvo in that battle, given its contemptuous view of the legal system and its focus, so familiar in Allen's films, on the overwhelming attraction younger women have for troubled older men. But while Allen's state of mind may have crept into the script, Irrational Man hardly seems clear-headed enough to serve as any sort of manifesto. It feels telling, though, that while the film's protagonist is an unrepentant, cold-blooded killer, the movie's real villain for most of its runtime is the younger woman who has a crush on him, and won't take no for an answer.  Joaquin Phoenix stars as Abe, a newly arrived philosophy professor at Rhode Island's fictional Braylin College. He's a shambling mess — potbellied and sleepy-eyed, with a well-used flask of single malt in his pocket and a bad case of writer's block to go with his bad case of the mumbling ennuis. ""Much of philosophy is verbal masturbation,"" he tells his class, offhandedly dismissing his entire field of study. Even so, he immediately becomes a campus lust object, as students and a married staffer, Rita (Parker Posey) fixate on his broody attitude and a rumored tragic past. (""I kind of like the burnout look,"" one beautiful college girl tells her friends. And so the myth of the irresistible dad-bod continues.) What's a schlubby guy to do, with all these women after his Lucky Charms? Among the smitten is Abe's student Jill Pollard (Emma Stone, also star of Allen's previous feature, 2014's cute-until-it's-infuriating Magic In The Moonlight). Jill doesn't see her vanilla-pudding boyfriend Roy (Jamie Blackley) as any barrier to her attempts to bed Abe, but she doesn't see any reason to break up with him, either. When Roy protests her infatuation and inability to talk about anything but Abe's impressive worldliness (""He's done every drug, but hates them all,"" she gushes), she dismisses him as paranoid and jealous, even once she's actively pursuing that infatuation. She's a woman who knows what she wants, and she mostly wants to be an emasculating, hypocritical shrew. Rita hits the same notes from the other side, pressuring Abe for sex behind her husband's back — what's a schlubby guy to do, with all these cheating women after his Lucky Charms? Irrational Man follows two primary tracks, both built around self-mythologizing and the blinding force of personal fantasies. In one, the depressed, impotent Abe perks up when he sets his sights on murdering a family-court judge after overhearing a miserable woman telling her friends how the judge wronged her in a custody case. Abe decides killing the judge would be justified, because he'd be ridding the world of a presumably terrible man. As a side bonus, murder would be an authentic, decisive experience in a mostly meaningless world. Meanwhile, Jill doggedly pressures the unwilling Abe to sleep with her, with the exact same sort of sociopathic self-justifications. She feels her interest in him obligates him; she even demands he finally bed her because it's her birthday. His complete lack of interest — in her body, in sex, even in life — is irrelevant compared to the image she's built of their relationship. Allen's characters are far from any form of believable humanity There's a hint of a clever gender reversal in the Abe / Jill relationship. Jill aggressively pushes the relationship's physical boundaries, vocally protesting being friend-zoned. Abe resists her advances with a series of face-saving, feminine ""soft no"" excuses like ""You could do better"" and ""You don't want to be involved with an extremist like me,"" instead distancing himself from her, or flatly pointing out the ethical conflict (and firing risk) of a professor / student relationship. But the film doesn't follow through on anything it starts to imply about modern men and women, or the stereotypes they fall into. The Abe / Jill business gets a perfunctory, apathetic resolution and moves on. The murder plot and the subsequent angst, familiar from Allen's Crimes And Misdemeanors, plays out at much more length, but with little more resolution. Jill and Abe alternate narrating the film, in what comes to feel like both of them testifying at an eventual murder trial, though Jill's voiceover in particular could double as a particularly pretentious journal. The narration leads to a funny moment or two — it becomes clear how mismatched the leads are when she's thinking about love while he's thinking about killing — but mostly, it piles on stilted, unlikely phrasing that highlights how far these characters are from any form of believable humanity. This is a movie where ""Are you having one of your morbid insights on the transient futility of life?"" counts as a come-on.   That sort of Allenist heightened dialogue might be wryly funny, except that Phoenix and Stone both play their roles with such grim, straight-faced, humorless determination, it's hard not to imagine Allen standing just off-camera, yelling, ""Grimmer! No smiling!"" into a megaphone. Posey, normally a larger-than-life comic presence, plays Rita through gritted teeth and a single fixed expression. This isn't a film of light touches and playful nuance. Yes, Abe's a murderer, but Jill's annoying It also isn't a film of meaningful conclusions or cogent thoughts. It veers back and forth about whether it wants to condemn Abe's actions: somehow, his murder plot still draws sympathy. Abe honestly seems to think he's helping not just the judge's seeming victim, but the world at large, and it's hard to resent his murder of an offscreen nonentity, especially when the act so thoroughly revitalizes him and the film. Jill's sexual scheming is less excusable, given that it affects a much more visible character, that it's pitched so shrilly, and that her sexual demands become so ploddingly redundant. Yes, Abe's a murderer, but Jill's annoying. If Allen had pulled back the camera a little to see what the world looks like outside Abe and Jill's fantasy bubbles, he might have reached a larger point about how narcissism blinds people to a larger world without actually erasing it. But larger perspectives have never been Allen's strong suit. He specializes in neurotics with an entertainingly blinkered viewpoint, and he has no interest in taking off the blinkers here. We never find out what happens to the woman Abe's supposedly trying to help; instead, we remain stuck inside Abe and Jill's worldviews, and both are toxic.   Ultimately, though this is a film in which the sexual predation of an obliviously selfish college girl is portrayed as uglier than murder, and that may say more about Allen's worldview than he'd care to admit. But apart from that between-the-lines message, the film doesn't communicate much. Like so many of Allen's recent films, it foregrounds its philosophical beliefs, then reminds the audience that it's all just verbal masturbation.

The expansion takes place during the Argent Tournament of Warcraft lore, though director Eric Dodds says it will be a much sillier take on the event compared to what series fans are used to. ""The Grand Tournament"" adds a new board to play on, as well as some powerful new cards to add to your deck — including a pirate riding a parrot. According to Dodds, one of the big changes in the expansion is a focus on cards that change the abilities of your hero character. All told the expansion will include 132 new cards (you can see a few examples below). Players will be able to pre-purchase a bundle of 50 new card packs starting next week for $49.99, while ""The Grand Tournament"" itself will launch next month.   Hearthstone first launched in beta last January, and since then the game has grown significantly. Initially available only on PC, it's since expanded to tablets and smartphones, with regular content updates adding new cards, features, and even a single-player mode. The first full expansion, ""Goblins vs. Gnomes,"" launched in December and added 120 new cards to the game. Most recently, Blizzard updated the game with a fourth game mode, called ""tavern brawl"", while also adding customizable character skins and card backs. Blizzard's focus on keeping Hearthstone fresh shouldn't be too surprising; at last count the free-to-play game had more than 30 million players. In June, the developer followed up Hearthstone with the release of another free game, Heroes of the Storm, a strategy title that goes up against some of the biggest, most lucrative games in the world, including League of Legends and Dota 2.

Now a new company, Sensel, is trying to take that idea a few steps further. It's launching a Kickstarter campaign today for what's essentially a giant version of the MacBook's Force Touch trackpad. But what makes it even more interesting is that Sensel's trackpad doesn't have to look like a flat slab — it can also transform into other input devices.  An iPad mini-sized, pressure-sensitive, shape-shifting trackpad Sensel's trackpad is called the Morph. It's similar in size to an iPad mini and is supposed to have 20,000 pressure sensors embedded throughout it. In a demo, the Morph was able to detect even the slightest pressure from my fingers; it even picked up the bristles of a paintbrush gliding across it. That input all appeared immediately when the Morph was wired to a Mac or PC; there was a very slight delay when connected to an iPad over Bluetooth.   Where the Morph really gets interesting is with what Sensel is calling ""overlays."" Overlays are thin covers that sit on top of the Morph's trackpad, transforming it from a flat surface into a more recognizable device: it could become a computer keyboard, a DJ controller, a piano keyboard, or a gamepad, for instance. Each cover can still tap into the full pressure sensitivity of the pad beneath it, so you can turn it into a piano that plays louder as you strike its keys harder, or a keyboard that allows you to rest your fingers on it. (Morph's keyboard overlay, in fact, is surprisingly easy to use.) Sensel Morph photosPreviousNextView full GalleryPreviousNext Sensel plans to make about 10 overlays to start, a few of which will ship with every Morph. But it's also interested in seeing what users of the Morph will do with it. Sensel wants to see people create their own overlays using 3D printing; Morph owners could even sketch out an overlay on paper and use that — it'll work just fine. Sensel is making an app that should allow people without coding knowledge to map areas of their custom overlays to specific commands, so people can create controllers specific to their needs. Morph's advantage is giving you something real to touch That could make the Morph a powerful tool for artists, gamers, or just technical power users. Although, there is reason to question how long the Morph will have an advantage over what you can buy from Apple: what are the chances that an iPad won't have a Force Touch display within the next year or so? Sensel readily admits that it sees that as the future, but it argues there's still a big reason to want the Morph. Even with pressure sensitivity, a tablet is just a flat piece of glass — there's no tactile feedback. Sensel is launching a Kickstarter campaign for the Morph beginning today. It's looking for $60,000, with the devices selling for $249 each. The campaign is supposed to be more about preorders than bankrolling; ""The device itself is pretty much ready to go,"" says Aaron Zarraga, Sensel's co-founder and chief technical officer. Sensel now plans to work on refining its overlays and figuring out what else the Morph's future users want to see it turn into.",0.4495493278908202,0.5504506721091798,0.19634891248596867,566,4.7614840989399294,304,5.7598684210526319,0,2,Tech

A clinical trial run by the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) will give 18 participants various doses of MDMA to test their reactions, Engadget reports. Despite its EDM festival reputation, MDMA is thought to be a useful anxiety treatment because of its ability to induce euphoria and empathy in users. Brad Burge, director of  communications at MAPS, says the trial is most interested in studying how MDMA ""enhances or facilitates the psychotherapeutic process for anxiety"" that comes with the diagnosis of a life-threatening disease. This isn't your EDM festival MDMA ""When that arousal comes about in an unsafe situation, such as outside of therapy, or in a recreational context it may be experienced as anxiety,"" he told Engadget. ""But in the context of psychotherapy, that arousal may be experienced as a form of fear but also excitement and tension. So that anxiety can be used productively to assist the therapeutic process."" This MDMA isn't the same stuff you'll find on festival grounds, anyway. It's been manufactured legally in a lab and exists in a much purer form than most drugs on the street. Still, the DEA's approval of the study shows a slight shift in perspective towards a drug that was criminalized in 1985. MAPS has had several MDMA studies approved before, including those focused on therapeutic treatment for PTSD and social anxiety related to autism. Trial participants must meet specific requirements: a diagnosed terminal illness, anxiety associated with that illness, and a life expectancy of at least nine months. The DEA's approval was the final step in readying the study. MAPS says it plans to begin the screening process soon. This is the seventh MDMA clinical trial MAPS has had approved Although this is MAPS' seventh study that has been approved for MDMA use, large-scale acceptance of the drug as a medical treatment is still a ways off. For MDMA to be available as a medical treatment outside of the trial, the FDA will need to give its approval. That process is not expected to start until 2017 and will likely take several years.

The rules will take effect in June ""Current federal well-drilling regulations are more than 30 years old, and they simply have not kept pace with the technical complexities of today’s hydraulic fracturing operations,"" said interior secretary Sally Jewell in the announcement today.

The decision gives the public the ability to download and remix the images freely (as long as they're attributed properly) and has been welcomed as a success for both space fans and copyright advocates. Unlike images of space published by NASA, SpaceX's photos do have some rights reserved, meaning they can't be used for commercial purposes. In the US, there's a well-established tradition of copyright-free space images thanks to the work of NASA. Because the space agency is funded by taxpayers, its photographs are deemed ""government works"" and therefore have ""no copyright restrictions on reproduction, derivative works, distribution, performance, or display."" NASA's most iconic images have started social movements and inspired millions This means that iconic images such as The Blue Marble, Earthrise, or the Pillars of Creation are free to use in pretty much any scenario. They've appeared on T-shirts, in adverts, and been published in books, embedding themselves in our collective conscious as images that are both inspirational and aspirational. And, as Electronic Frontier Foundation activist Parker Higgins notes, they've also ""formed the basis of major social movements [and] activism campaigns."" SpaceX, by comparison, has no obligation to release its images to the public. Speaking to Motherboard about the issue, intellectual property lawyer Andrew Rush said: ""Just because they're operating on behalf of NASA does not necessarily mean the copyright of their images are owned by NASA or the US government. When SpaceX is operating as a NASA contractor, generally any of the copyrightable stuff they create is subject to copyright protections."" The newly-applied Creative Commons license for SpaceX's images isn't the same as putting them into the public domain, but campaigners say it's a start. ""It’d be nice if these photos could appear in Wikipedia or be built upon without any caveats by artists and entrepreneurs,"" Higgins told The Atlantic. ""But it’s still a good thing that these are going online under clear terms.""All images credited to SpaceX.  A Falcon 9 rocket launching an Orbcomm-OG2 satellite on July 14th, 2015.

Arctic sea ice typically reaches a high point around February or March, as it expands with colder temperatures. According to the latest figures from the NSIDC, this year's maximum point is the lowest since satellite observations began in 1979. Arctic sea ice appears to have reached a maximum on February 25th of this year, when it covered 5.61 million square miles — 50,200 square miles lower than the previous lowest winter maximum in 2011. The NSIDC acknowledges the difficulty in identifying the exact high point, due to variability in seasonal trends, though there was ""a clear downward trend"" in ice coverage for several days following February 25th. ""Over the next two to three weeks, periods of increase are still possible,"" the NSIDC said in a report published Thursday. ""However, it now appears unlikely that there could be sufficient growth to surpass the extent reached on February 25.""   Overall, Arctic sea ice grew by 3.83 million square miles this winter, which is significantly lower than last year. Sea ice levels reached a record low in 2012, and the NSIDC says this year's low maximum is likely due to unusual wind patterns that led to warmer conditions over the Pacific side of the Arctic. Once sea ice reaches a maximum, it begins melting during the warmer spring and summer months, typically reaching a minimum around September. Declining levels of arctic sea ice could have a range of environmental and social implications, as Vox explains in greater detail. The NSIDC will release a comprehensive analysis of 2014-2015 winter ice coverage in April, after data for March has been collected.",0.37992780992966,0.62007219007034,0.8723393604857227,308,5.0194805194805197,186,5.89247311827957,0,2,Science

They also work with limited resources — one important, but laborious aspect of treating Ebola involves recording medical information on paper. Doctors in a medical enclosure must write a patient's information down, walk to the edge of the enclosure, yell the information to their colleagues outside the tent, and then destroy the paper. Up until now, that was the safest way to contain the disease while transferring information. Now, a new Google tablet that can withstand chlorine sanitization renders that process unnecessary, Wired reports. Jay Achar, a doctor stationed in Sierra Leone as part of Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), or Doctors Without Borders, spoke to Wired about the tablet. Achar works in a high-risk medical facility in the city of Magburaka, and asked his collegue Ivan Gayton to find a more efficient way to transfer medical records. Gayton, in turn, asked developers at Google.org — Google's charitable branch — for a solution. The company responded by creating a wireless tablet that could travel safely outside medical facilities.

Today, CEO and co-founder Steve Huffman posted a small update on Reddit's new moderator tools and rules for policing the site's worst communities — which could spell one of the biggest shifts in the site's history. He stayed to chat about what the changes would mean. And the inevitable question came up: ""How do you feel about hosting what may soon be the biggest white supremacist forum on the internet?"" Horrible, actually, but I don't think you can win an argument by simply silencing the opposition. Another user pointed out a seven-year-old comment in which Huffman said that ""we've always banned hate speech, and we always will."" Huffman followed up: While my personal views towards bigotry haven't changed, my opinion of what Reddit should do about it has. I don't think we should silence people just because their viewpoints are something we disagree with. There is value in the conversation, and we as a society need to confront these issues. This is an incredibly complex topic, and I'm sure our thinking will continue to evolve. This is a problem. The problem isn't necessarily with allowing hate speech on Reddit. Policing large communities is an extremely complex topic — just look at the fight over showing breastfeeding on Facebook for an example of heavier moderation backfiring. As in real life, good (or okay) speech can easily become collateral damage when you take down bad speech, especially when automation or large networks of moderators come into play. Whether or not this applies to Reddit is up for discussion. The problem is that Huffman doesn't frame the debate this way, and neither do many other people. By some very common logic, networks like the racist ""Chimpire"" aren't bugs in the system. They're valuable dissenting opinions that will help us settle important issues. So allowing r/CoonTown to exist isn't just a principled decision, it's one with practical benefits. That's not only dead wrong, it's fundamentally antithetical to valuable debate. There's a place for confronting issues head-on. Social progress happens when people are willing to accept scrutiny of beliefs they took for granted — dismantling religious arguments against gay marriage was an incredibly valuable exercise. But to turn those conversations into real change, there has to be a point at which we consider the question settled and move on. Climate change is real. Vaccines do not cause autism. Dark skin does not make someone literally subhuman. At some point, ""debate"" isn't a good-faith act, it's a stalling tactic to protect the status quo. At some point, ""debate"" is just stalling to protect the status quo And unfortunately, no question is ever settled on the internet. Its sheer size guarantees that however ludicrous or harmful a belief, there's probably a community that will foster it. The internet has democratized all kinds of opinions, making a single person's blog as accessible as a New York Times editorial. There's no way to conclusively ""win"" an argument with 3 billion people. This is okay when you're talking about, say, the best way to board an airplane or the four-corner simultaneous 24-hour day. The evidence comes down on one side, but keeping the debate open is relatively harmless — at best, an interesting thought experiment. Nobody makes you hear the opposition out before you set your one-corner alarm clock. But when the issue is whether one gender, sexual orientation, or race is inherently inferior to another, it's not an abstract question. Calling for an ""argument"" or a ""conversation"" means demanding that women or queer people or people of color defend their own humanity. Whether or not they do it successfully, it's a draining and demoralizing exercise, dragging a centuries-old struggle back to its starting point. Is that energy really worth deploying against the ""official chimpout advisory guide"" and r/WatchNiggersDie? Defending your own humanity is not a harmless intellectual argument To be clear, we are rarely talking about rigorous scientific research into health and intelligence, or CDC surveys about black communities, or any of the other standard slippery slopes. We're talking about forums that argue from the assumption that the vast majority of black people are halfwits or violent criminals attempting to exterminate the white race. They add nothing to our understanding of race, crime, or social organization. Their main function is to shift the Overton Window far enough that non-murderous racism seems moderate. Committing to absolute, hands-off openness will eventually mean defending speech that is truly worthless and harmful. Not a ""dissenting viewpoint"" or ""opposition."" Not vulgar speech that creates something new. Speech that you are willing to accept even though the world would probably be better off if it were silenced.

So whether some of the leading map apps will actually bother is an open question. It'll also be a pretty long time until anyone's even able to use this feature. Ford says Sync 3 will initially ship with its current version of AppLink, which allows for static images only. Sometime next year is when we'll see AppLink 3.0 released, another reminder that changes in the auto industry just don't come overnight. When AppLink 3.0 goes live, it will already have one significant partner backing it: Alibaba. Ford says that AutoNavi, Alibaba’s own navigation app, will be just one example of projecting a smartphone app to your Sync 3-enabled screen. But hopefully the automaker can rally support from other developers — at least until it finally puts a date on rolling out CarPlay and Android Auto support. Once that happens, most sensible people will probably stick to Apple or Google Maps anyway.",0.599838687606284,0.400161312393716,0.1319468104934248,230,5.0782608695652174,172,5.6104651162790695,0,0,"Apps, Tech, Transportation"

The design is a a joint pitch from Dutch firm Mecanoo Architecten and DC's own Martinez+Johnson Architecture and it wants to modernize the library's classic Mies van der Rohe style while turning it into a multifunctional environment.   Keeping Mies' horizontal aesthetic as the core structure, the proposal designs each floor with a specific purpose. The basement is the ""Innovation Room,"" outfitted with movable acoustic walls, stages for debates and lectures, and a lot of storage space. The ground level will be divided into two cores with informal auditorium space, a special area for the newest releases and library information, as well as a bookstore and a cafe. The higher floors have more defined purposes: an education floor with children's and teens' hubs as well as a space for watching videos and gaming; a reading floor which has the most traditional ""library"" kind of atmosphere with bookshelves, desks, tables, and lots of seating; a history floor for special collections and archives; and finally, a rooftop deck and garden space. Can a new library experience exist in an old building? It's an inspired design that, instead of simply razing the building and starting from scratch, attempts to make something new out of the existing structure. This preserves the site's historic value, but even so, it comes with controversy. The proposal also wants to turn the library into a mixed private-public space, possibly with housing units at the very top of the building. Some don't want any private involvement at all, but having a healthy amount could help administrators maintain the building more easily.  There's also, of course, the issue of funding: currently Washington, DC Mayor Vincent Gray only committed $103 million to the project, and the price tag could be as high as $250 million.

Japanese electronics company Roland released the TR-808 Rhythm Composer in 1980, and for a long time people thought the only way to make dance music was with this Halloween-colored box. The noises that came from the analog circuitry inside — particularly the big, round bass drum — made people go insane on the dancefloor. And they still do: the 808 is at the core of new songs from Beyoncé (“Drunk in Love”)  and Daft Punk (“Doin’ It Right”), just to name a few. But Roland stopped making the 808 in the mid-80s. You can buy one on eBay now for around three grand (and maybe another grand to bring it into good working condition), or use one of the thousands of hardware or software imitators available online or at Guitar Center. Most of them do a decent job recreating the functionality of the original, but they’ve all just been humble odes to a classic — until now. Today, Roland is announcing the TR-8 Rhythm Performer, the first true spiritual successor to the TR-808. It’s the head of a family of four devices called AIRA that also includes the TB-3 Touch Bassline, the VT-3 Vocal Transformer, and the System-1 Plug-Out Synthesizer. The TR-8 feels like the real thing because it is the real thing. As an all-digital affair, it’s very deliberately not a re-issue: instead, Roland developed a new digital modeling paradigm called Analog Circuit Behavior to faithfully recreate the big sounds of transistors and diodes that made the TR-808 so famous. As a lifelong drum machine addict I can tell you this is not some marketing BS — Roland actually assigned an engineer to work full-time on just the bass drum sound, A/B testing the digital version against the original until the two were functionally and audibly indistinguishable. The TR-8’s kick is the sound that subwoofers were invented for, and anyone who has a problem with it is probably trying too hard.   But the kick was only a small part of the reason the TR-808 became an icon. The funnest and most awesome part of using an old 808 is how simple it is to create loops with a 16-step sequencer, which allows the user to create a 16-beat loop — a form factor it pioneered. The TR-8 doesn’t just sound like a champ: it’s got this visceral, tactile experience with all the straightforwardness and get-shit-done mentality of its ancestor, but with a big ol’ truckload of intuitive new control features that make it really fun to make music on. Every sound now has dedicated decay and tuning knobs, each sequenced step has programmable delay and reverb, and you can even sidechain audio from external sources to create that ""pumping and breathing"" sound that defines nearly ever David Guetta song. These digital conveniences are all rolled seamlessly into the time-tested interface, but the flashiest addition to the face of the box is the scatter wheel. It’s a brazenly glitchy re-trigger effect that feels distinctly 21st-century — like the chopped-up vocals of Skrillex’s ""Bangarang."" The sixteen step buttons now light up in a variety of informational colors (including those famously-80’s Halloween hues of the 808), and there’s a three-character LCD display above the ""Tempo"" knob. There are loads more drum sounds to be heard here than there were on the 808 — from 909s to 707s, other well-known Roland machines, and everything else in the world of synthesized percussion — but not much else has changed. Roland’s biggest triumph here is keeping everything refreshingly musical: every function in the box fits perfectly under ten fingers, immaculately programmable and super-intuitive. Not a bad deal for $499. On the business end of the TR-8, things have changed a lot: instead of individual audio outputs for each percussion sound, there are two assignable outs and a USB port for sending audio information to a multitrack digital workstation. There’s a stereo input pair that allows the TR-8 to act as a small mixer, and instead of the ancient DIN instrument synchronization port, there are (only slightly-less ancient) MIDI ports. Now, if you’ve archived your MIDI cables along with your parallel and VGA connectors, you’ll want to dust them off now… because the TR-8 didn’t come to this party alone. Just as the TR-808 was meant to replace a human drummer, Roland’s TB-303 Bass Line sequencer from 1982 was meant to replace, you know, a bassist. But while the 808 always sounded like percussion, the 303 never sounded like a four-stringed instrument — it spit out a completely alien vocabulary of squelches, slides, and analog flatulence that early dance producers soon co-opted for their own devious amusement. They called the product Acid House — and while it never spent much time in the pop spotlight, it remains the most sonically distinctive genre of music ever created. The ingredients are simple: a TB-303 synced to an 808, 606, or 909 drum machine, or a very close imitation of that pair. Predictably, like 808s, original 303s can also fetch around three grand on eBay. Not-so-predictably, Roland is releasing an evolved 303 as the second member of the AIRA family: the TB-3 Touch Bassline. Unlike the evolutionary design from TR-808 to TR-8, the TB-3 bears almost no physical resemblance to its spiritual predecessor — and that’s probably a good thing. The original Bass Line was a messy (but lovable) hybrid between a sequencer and a keyboard, but it was a pretty shitty sequencer and flat-out miserable as a keyboard. So Acid House producers mostly mashed buttons and turned knobs at random until they got something good — it’s an ethos that’s reflected perfectly in the TB-3’s Kaoss Pad-like touch interface. It’s still a shitty keyboard, but that’s kind of exactly the point — it’s way more fun to bang in notes at random and turn the signature cutoff, resonance, and accent knobs than it is to sit down and try to do some sort of deliberate composition with the thing. There are 26 Analog Circuit Behavior-based sound sets that model the true functionality of the original analog 303, including many that are distinct nods to the huge hacking community that’s developed around the box — most recognizably the Australian Devil Fish mod. But there are also three extra banks of sounds that are decidedly un-303. That makes it easy to harness the peculiar sequencing characteristics of the Bass Line, but without using actual bass sounds — think sharp synth leads and smoothly-bubbling ambient pads. Note, accent, and glide randomize functions are baked in too, so the machine can do the button-mashing for you — and of course, you can use the touch display to do Kaoss Pad-esque filter and envelope sweeps. For an electronic music junkie, there’s nothing closer to nirvana than the $299 TB-3 slaved to a TR-8. They are the peanut butter and jelly of production, and using them together elicits the kind of childish bliss that’s usually reserved for playgrounds and petting zoos. While the TR-8 and the TB-3 are the obvious heads of the AIRA household, the virtual-analog System-1 synth ($599, shipping this summer) and VT-3 vocal effects box ($199, shipping in April) round out this nuclear family in a way that feels downright wholesome. There’s something that just clicks when you have all four members on the same table in front of you: it’s the four elements of modern electronic music performance in hardware form, which is something you don’t see very often without a laptop also in tow. They’re all cut from the same unapologetically futuristic cloth: black brushed-metal faces with Tron-esque green edging and sloped-in sides that give the whole kit a thickness and presence that you’d never see in a laptop. Well, maybe you’d see it in an Alienware joint, but that’s not such a bad look for a drum machine, it turns out. Seeing them blink and step in unison is simultaneously comforting and exhilarating: ""Come with us,"" they seem to whisper in unison, ""to a place where the fog machines never run out of juice."" They’re your little buddies — and most importantly, you can’t do spreadsheets or check Friendster or watch porn on them. All you can do is rock. Rocking out — and appealing to beginners — are two facets of electronic music production that are becoming rare in an increasingly-Ableton’d world. Die-hard Roland fetishists will likely be sated by the sound universe that the company has recreated with Analog Circuit Behavior. That’s a huge triumph in itself — now there’s essentially no legitimate reason to continue spending money on the legacy hardware except for museum-grade nostalgia, which is something that most serious aspiring producers can’t afford to indulge in. And in any case, Roland knows that those heavy tweakers aren’t going to help them grow their future audience. With AIRA, Roland has built a contemporary hardware composition platform that’s as easy to enjoy as an electric guitar.

That’s the mindset of a San Francisco-based startup called Cuff, which has just announced a new line of wearables (available to pre-order now) with a goal of making technology you’ll actually want to wear and show off. Cuff’s accessories are also different than the current wearables marketplace in another way — rather than focusing on fitness tracking or smartphone notifications, Cuff is positioning its product as a personal security system that lets you quickly reach a pre-designated circle of trusted contacts.  The whole system is based off the CuffLinc: a small black tracker that owners can move between any of the nine different fashion accessories the company is bringing to market. Using the accompanying iOS app, you can set up your CuffLinc and find other friends and family using the product to build your network. ""Imagine a mom puts [a CuffLinc] on her teenage daughter and also puts it on her aging mother,"" explains Cuff founder Deepa Sood, a former VP of product at Restoration Hardware. ""When you press it, they get a sort of smart propagation depending on who's closest in your social network and who's closest geographically. And then the receiver, if they're wearing a cuff, their cuff will vibrate."" ""Our first function is security."" From there, you can open the Cuff app and find out exactly where the person who sent the alert is, thanks to the built-in GPS chip. ""If they're not wearing a cuff, which many men won't be wearing a cuff, the alert goes right to their phone, and that gives you geographic information,"" says Sood. ""The idea is that you buy a couple different pieces and you move the CuffLinc around,"" she says, ""and you buy it for your loved ones to protect them, because our first function is security."" There’s some flexibility here, as well — the iOS app (the company hopes to launch on Android as well) will let you get more granular with the CuffLinc’s alert system. By double-clicking the CuffLinc, for example, you could send a notification directly to your spouse without alerting the rest of your network. You can customize the vibration pattern, as well, so the recipient will know it’s not a real emergency. ""S.O.S. is the primary function, but even in the first roll out it's not just for emergencies,"" says Sood. ""If I’m wearing the Cuff, I can program it so my husband and my babysitter can always get through to me even if my phone's not on me — it'll vibrate and them I know I have to step out and reach them.""     It’s a bit of an esoteric and new use case for wearable technology, but Cuff is already thinking about more features it can add down the line. As the CuffLinc is connected to your phone with Bluetooth, the team envisions using it as a remote to trigger different features, like skipping songs or taking a photo. ""Very soon we’ll be peeling off behavior from your phone,"" says Sood. ""We’ve talked about taking a picture, or making your phone ring to get out of a bad date. People really liked that one."" New features will be enabled via a software update, and different click patterns can be assigned to trigger your phone. And you won’t have to worry about charging — the CuffLinc’s non-replaceable battery should power it for a year, at which point you’ll receive a notification that you’ll unfortunately need to purchase a new one. Wearable tech with style — but you'll have to wait for it Perhaps more important than the technology behind Cuff is the company’s fashion-first sensibility: if people don’t actively want to wear the company’s products, they’ll never catch on. To that end, Cuff will offer nine different items, ranging from a simple keychain to more attention grabbing leather and metal bracelets, necklaces, and pendants — each of which comes with a CuffLinc that can be embedded invisibly inside the piece of jewelry. The metal pieces come in either silver or gold plating, while the leather pieces also come in two different color options. While Cuff may be clearly targeting a feminine market with these first pieces and the style is, as always, a matter of personal taste, there’s little doubt these are some of the most stylish wearables we’ve seen on the market. And Sood has greater ambition for the Cuff line than just this first set of jewelry the company is launching — she wants other makers to start producing CuffLinc compatible pieces, building out an ever-expanding collection. If this first set doesn’t work with your style, there may be something down the line that does.

Cuff hopes to add more features, hopefully release more jewelry variations, and even find retail partners between now and then, but right now its a bit akin to buying into a Kickstarter or beta project — you don’t quite know what you’ll get at the end of the year. And while Cuff has a lead on making a fashionable that you may actually want to wear, that could change in the coming months.

The new exhibition, which opened Saturday, is aptly titled ""A Collection of Ideas"" and it covers everything from Minecraft to drones to riot suits, framing each as a work that pushes new forms forward — despite each piece being individually quite commonplace. ""I'm always dealing with the fact that design is often discussed only in the style pages of magazines, or sometimes in the business pages,"" Paola Antonelli, MoMA's senior curator of architecture and design, tells The Verge. ""It's so difficult to show people that it's not about decoration, it's not about superfluity — it's about real life."" And the new exhibition's most eye-catching selections are in fact those that stay closest to what we know. On one side of the collection is the ""@"" sign, on the other is a towering model of Google Maps' location pin. They're ubiquitous symbols — and perhaps easily overlooked because of it — but they're critical to daily interactions online. The exhibition also includes what is effectively a small arcade: a hallway filled with classic Atari games, from Asteroids to Pong. The games are displayed on screens set just slightly into the wall — though there's no frame around them, they're given the same tasteful display, spacing, and plaque that any classic painting might. Naturally, you can play them too. MoMA has been collecting video games for several years now, and they’ve come to look quite natural alongside more traditional works of art. In this case, the Atari works are featured for pushing forward a particular medium — Asteroids, for example, is noted for its early use of vector graphics. Elsewhere, the new collection also features Minecraft, pointing toward its algorithmically generated worlds that make no two players' experiences alike. ""Times change but human nature doesn't that much."" A large portion of the new collection has a similar focus, highlighting how interaction and design have evolved alongside one another. Largely, everything else in the collection plays off of that by utilizing digital tools in their creation and conception or by taking pragmatic objects and displaying them as traditional art. One series of works highlights how digital tools have aided in the recreation of natural forms: a chair with joints modeled after bones, a wooden sculpture that recreates a detailed scan of a scorpion's paw. Another highlights objects involved with violence, presenting a drone and a tool used for de-arming minefields as though they were traditional pieces in an installation. ""They're beautiful objects with tragic roles,"" Antonelli says. Without question, these objects can feel disconnected within MoMA's new collection, as their aim is to highlight the museum's newer works — not to tell a strict narrative. ""Sometimes,"" says Antonelli, ""it's better to give more breadth and not connect the dots in ways that people can connect themselves."" But nonetheless, there's still a story buried there that highlights how design has persisted and evolved across decades and centuries. ""Times change but human nature doesn't that much,"" Antonelli notes. ""There are some immutable ideas in design, and some that change a lot.""

But the company is turning that image on its head with the the new DP Quattro line, on show for the first time at CP+ 2014 in Yokohama, Japan. The cameras are similar to the Merrills, specs-wise — fixed 19mm, 30mm, and 50mm f/2.8 lenses paired with Sigma's unique Foveon APS-C sensor — but the industrial design is a radical departure from anything else on the market. The DP Quattro's body itself is extremely thin, but the grip veers off at impossible angles, actually extending beyond the rear of the camera. The overall effect is strikingly minimalist, reducing the camera down to the bare essentials: a lens, a grip with controls, and a box to house them all.  Sigma representatives told me that the design is based on feedback from DP Merrill customers — particularly Western males — that the blocky form factor wasn't comfortable enough. As a large-handed Western male myself, I'm not altogether convinced; although the buttons were all easy to reach, I was never quite sure where to rest my thumb, and the grip doesn't feel as chunkily comfortable as that of a DSLR or a mirrorless camera like Sony's NEX-7. It's an improvement on the traditional bricks that came before it, but not a huge one. The DP Quattro will always be a niche product, in any case. Like the DP Merrill, its fixed lenses and the Foveon sensor's trademark color reproduction appeal to a certain kind of photographer, but many will be put off by the slow (if accurate) autofocus and unconventional controls. It'll be a premium product, too, if its predecessors are anything to go by; each DP Merrill sold for $999, though Sigma wouldn't confirm a price for the Quattro. But whatever it ends up costing, Sigma deserves credit for innovating with camera design in a way that we haven't seen since the advent of mirrorless models. The DP Quattro is a risky, beautiful product that just might make others take notice and think outside the box.

""But I needed a much more consistent schedule to take care of a baby."" It took a while, but she was ultimately able to find a job that was stable, profitable, and respectful of employees' time. ""I was afraid for a while that this was a unicorn I'd never find."" The downside, as Andrea tells it, ""is that it's not growing rapidly like the Amazons and Googles of the world, so there's not really room to move up. That's OK with me now, but I think I would have wanted more when I was 25."" That, in a nutshell, is why the diversity reports released earlier this year by three of the biggest technology firms are so bad. For every three women employed by Apple, Google, or Facebook, there are roughly seven men. Go into the technology departments and it drops even lower — women make up just 15 percent of Facebook’s tech workers, while Google’s leadership numbers are 79 percent to 21 percent in favor of men. None of these firms feature on Working Mother’s annual 100 Best Companies awards — now seen as a benchmark survey for firms with mother-friendly cultures. Instead, technology is represented by the dinosaurs — IBM and HP, for example, who have bigger workforces than their younger counterparts — IBM’s stood at 431,212 in 2013, while Google has 55,000. Is it because IBM and Hewlett-Packard have been around for decades? Or is it because they both have women at the helm? Paternity leave is crucial for gender equality It’s well-established that a longer maternity leave is good for both employer and employee — a 2009 report by the Institute of Women’s Policy Research said as much — but this thinking has now jumped the gender gap. Last month, the ILO published a report on parental right in small- and medium-sized firms. As well as maternity protection counting for a happier, more productive workforce, it said that paternity leave resulted in reduced absenteeism amongst male employees, improved their health, and was ""crucial for gender equality."" Andrea, who is the only woman on a team of 18, thinks that one significant change could help level the field. ""If men took leave too, I think we wouldn't have that problem [of gender imbalance] as much,"" she says. ""When men have a chance to spend more time with their kids, everyone benefits. Plus it helps combat any perceived productivity differences between men and women in the workplace. If both are taking time off, it helps equalize them. I don't want to be thought of as a liability to my company just because I'm female."" The great 21st-century tech triumvirate — Apple, Google, and Facebook — have among the most progressive attitudes toward parental leave in the whole of the United States. Google offers new mothers 22 weeks’ paid leave, plus a smorgasbord of benefits, while Apple recently implemented changes that give new mothers up to 18 weeks off — fathers get up to six week, with both parents enjoying their full salary while away. But only Facebook sees equal parenting rights as the way forward, offering 17 weeks paid for both parents, as well as $4,000 in cash benefits and subsidized childcare.   The US is the only developed country that doesn’t guarantee paid maternity or parental leave to workers Under US federal law, mothers are allowed up to 12 weeks’ unpaid leave. New dads get nothing in the way of paternity leave, although they are allowed to take up to 84 days off under the terms of the Family and Medical Leave Act--provided they have worked for the same firm for at least a year, working at least 1,250 hours, and as long as that firm has more than 50 employees. This leave is, however, also unpaid and, according to a report from Boston College’s Center for Work and Family released in June of this year, men will only take time off if it is paid. If you give a man two weeks’ paid leave when his child is born, he will take two weeks off. If you offer him none, he will continue at work. Just three states — California, Rhode Island, and New Jersey — offer paid family leave, the money coming from employee-paid tax. A 2014 report by the International Labor Organization, called it the worst in the developed world. In September, US Labor Secretary Tom Perez said, ""We are not serving our women well."" Livia Moore is a 29-year-old global community manager for e-commerce firm Tictail. She relocated to New York from Sweden last month and feels that rights for both men and women should be on an even footing. ""Big tech firms should set the industry standard of encouraging equal relationships, where both parents share responsibility for childcare and household work,"" she says. ""The idea of parental leave options for men and women allows both parents time to focus on their careers and bond with their children. It also encourages a more open-minded workplace where families are not defined in the heteronormative terms of mother and father. Creating a culture that allows you to focus on both your career and having a family on your own terms is essential."" Sweden grants up to 480 days' paid parental leave per child Sweden is, of course, seen as the most progressive nation when it comes to parental rights. Leave is not granted to the mother or father, but rather offers up to 480 days' paid parental leave per child until that child is eight. This can be shared by both parents — they can claim up to 80% of their salary, capped at a certain level —  though not at the same time, and fathers have to take a minimum of 60 days. Because the policy is centered around each child rather than its mother, no discrimination can be made against women of childbearing age by their employers. Bjorn Jeffery is CEO of Toca Boca, a digital toy studio with offices in the US and Sweden, and he allows his employees to take up to 12 months’ leave when they have a child. ""I think respecting people's time and family life as a company is something that many employees appreciate and in turn respect a lot,"" he said. ""I would argue that overall productivity can actually increase since people can focus solely on their tasks at hand without being concerned about the rest of their lives becoming impaired because of rigid work rules."" When Bjorn became a father for the first time earlier this year, many of his Swedish friends assumed he would return to the motherland for its father-friendly policies. But then, when you’re CEO of a firm, you can choose your own childcare policy. ""We don't have a predetermined time that [both men and women] can be on parental leave, other than what is regulated in law,"" he says. ""This means you can be on parental leave for say 12 months, and still get your job back when you return."" Ask the big firms about how they are trying to rectify the gender imbalance in their ranks and they are quick to point you towards letters from their CEO regarding diversity, new hires, and board members who happen to be women, and egg-freezing perks — that’s Apple. Facebook emailed a long list of woman-friendly initiatives, including a scholarship program for female students, the Girls Who Code summer internship, and a designated team to improve the firm’s diversity rates, while declining to answer any specific questions on the subject. At time of writing, Google had yet to respond. So what career advice would Andrea give her eight-year-old daughter should she desire unfettered access to a CEO title? ""Not to drop out of the workforce, ever, and especially in tech. It's so hard to get back in, and you can never make up that lost momentum.""",0.6242368576743285,0.37576314232567154,0.8527738934983239,1352,4.7426035502958577,671,6.0372578241430697,0,2,"Business, Report"

That means bonuses for signing multiyear deals that secure YouTube limited-time exclusives on new content, or alternatively, bonuses tied to the traffic performance of videos. Competing with YouTube is hard. It's the home of user-generated video on the web and has nurtured a number of hugely popular stars whose earnings now stretch into the millions of dollars each year. The value of those compelling personalities has grown even higher this year thanks to companies like Yahoo actively recruiting YouTube's stars for competing video services.  The chief threats to Google's hegemony are said to be Facebook and new video startup Vessel, the latter having been announced this summer by former Hulu CEO Jason Kilar. Vessel's plan is reportedly to lure away YouTube's biggest attractions with lucrative offers for 72-hour exclusives on new videos. The subscription-based service would then seek to establish itself as a premium alternative to YouTube, relying on the appeal of having the latest content first. It's expected to launch by the end of this year, which is apparently what's led to the ""rare urgency"" of Google's actions in trying to prevent an exodus of its most bankable users. A YouTube spokeswoman told the Journal that there's nothing unusual about the investment in video makers and that YouTube has ""been increasing that support through a broad range of activities including marketing and content funding."" As the stars of YouTube begin to broaden their horizons — making money from product endorsements and other media like books — Google's grip on their marketability will inevitably slip. No one expects those who built their reputations on YouTube to abandon the service entirely, it's still too big and influential, but some of the biggest names might soon debut their latest stuff at other places on the web. That's the thing Google is now working to prevent, which may generate a whole new bidding war for the services of the web's most sought-after personalities.",0.6846487911484044,0.3153512088515956,0.8357309009127553,357,5.1820728291316529,229,6.0611353711790397,0,0,"Business, Google, Tech"

If caught, fines for both Uber and its drivers are steep, running $1,500 for the company (for the first offense) and up to $2,250 for the driver, with those fines going up to $5,000 for additional violations.

""This is really amazing. Apparently, they believe they're gods."" An Uber spokeswoman said the company plans to support drivers there ""every step of the way."" It's currently unclear if that means Uber plans to foot the bill for those fines. Uber's entrance to the city is complicated due to Portland's proximity to neighboring cities where Uber is allowed, including right across the bridge to Vancouver, Washington. Drivers in those places can pick people up and take them into Portland within minutes, meaning whatever return trip to those areas requires riding without a paid passenger on the way back. In a press release condemning the move, Novick says the city is still in the process of reevaluating its taxi laws to allow companies like Uber and Lyft to operate. Like just about every other city that's had issues, the concern centers on insurance and background checks on drivers. Traditional taxi companies require drivers to have certain rates of commercial insurance and annual background checks, whereas there's been less of a guarantee among the various transportation companies. Novick notes that he invited Uber and Lyft to submit changes to existing laws and regulations, but that ""Uber has chosen instead to break the law."" Uber's been under close scrutiny from regulators in much of the US, Europe, and more recently in Southeast Asia.

Broadcasters are striking deals with the satellite provider to neuter the functionality during talks to secure the carriage agreements that allow Dish to rebroadcast the networks and their affiliates. One such deal was made late last night. Just 12 hours after CBS channels went black on Dish following months of failed contract negotiations, the two companies came to an agreement. CBS channels are now back on air for subscribers, but it seems Dish had to give up Auto Hop to get favorable terms. 12-hour blackout leads to a quick deal According to a joint press release, Auto Hop will now be disabled on CBS for a full seven days after shows premiere in primetime. That's a valuable window for broadcasters: one of Nielsen's audience-measuring metrics, known as C7, estimates the number of viewers who watch the commercials for each show during its premiere and any DVR viewings up to seven days after. Broadcasters use those metrics to sell ads and set prices for spots. But for Dish customers, it effectively kills Auto Hop. Before today's agreement, primetime shows watched after 1AM the following day would have the commercials automatically ""erased."" Now subscribers will either have to wait a week to watch the latest episode of their favorite show, or they'll go back to the old way of doing things: manually fast-forwarding through commercials on their DVR. Broadcasters can avoid the courts and still get their way Disney set the precedent for this type of deal earlier this year, when it too used rebroadcasting negotiations to neuter Auto Hop. Its deal with Dish disabled Auto Hop on ABC for three days following premieres. It's highly likely that the other major broadcasters will follow suit when it comes time for them to negotiate their own carriage agreements. CBS, Disney (ABC), Comcast (NBC), and Fox have all taken Dish to court over Auto Hop in the past with no real success, but the broadcasters have realized that by threatening to withhold their programming they can strong-arm Dish into disabling the feature — no courts required. Indeed, as part of these agreements, both CBS and Disney have dropped all pending litigation with Dish. Dish is getting something in exchange, however. It's using these deals (first with Disney, and now with CBS) to lay the groundwork for an over-the-top internet TV service — something everyone from Apple, Intel, Sony, Amazon, and Google have reportedly tried to crack. All of the companies have struggled to get content providers on board, but Dish already has relationships with broadcasters and it's using renegotiations to insert over-the-top clauses into contracts. The press release is vague, but it says the new agreement includes ""a path"" to over-the-top distribution of Showtime. The deal with Disney earlier this year also gave Dish rights to distribute ABC networks (including ESPN) over the internet, if and when the satellite company decides to launch an internet TV service. And what about Dish subscribers? Well, they might be losing Auto Hop, but they will be getting access to the Showtime Anytime internet streaming service for the first time.

Last month, companies like Google, Microsoft, and Apple urged the Obama administration to put an end to the NSA's bulk collection of metadata. The NSA, on the other hand, continues to parade the idea that the government needs access to encrypted data on smartphones and other devices to track and prevent criminal activity. Now, NSA director Michael S. Rogers says he might have a solution. During a recent speech at Princeton University, Rogers suggested tech companies could create a master multi-part encryption key capable of unlocking any device, The Washington Post reports. That way, if the key were broken into pieces, no single person would have the ability to use it. ""I don't want a back door."" ""I don’t want a back door,"" Rogers said. ""I want a front door. And I want the front door to have multiple locks. Big locks."" The suggestion comes as Congress considers a new framework for handling encrypted data. Government and law enforcement officials say total encryption could stand in the way of national security operations, while leaders in the tech industry and advocacy groups say the government shouldn't have complete, unobstructed access to citizens' private communications. During this year's South by Southwest festival, Edward Snowden held a secret meeting in which he said tech companies needed to take a stronger position against NSA surveillance. He said companies should adopt more secure technology that could block surveillance altogether, and championed end-to-end encryption, which would mean no one except the sender and recipient would have access to private communications. A master encryption key still creates vulnerabilities  Rogers suggests the adoption of ""front door"" access will allow for essential security measures while keeping data safe from hackers or an outside attack. But opponents of the idea note that even broken into pieces, a master digital key creates security flaws.

The video wasn't quite the first official confirmation of Clinton's campaign — an email sent out earlier this afternoon by an aide to past donors from the 2008 campaign made the presidential run official. But the YouTube video is the public-facing announcement. It appeals to everyday working Americans and their families, and uses the limelight to paint the candidate as a defender of those without influence, money, or power. Alongside the video, campaign staffers published a new Facebook page for Clinton that includes a (selective) history of her life, starting from her birth in 1947. Her Twitter bio has also been updated to include ""2016 presidential candidate."" ""Dog owner"" and ""FLOAR"" (First Lady of Arkansas) got the boot to make space for the new title.

At this point, it's already very likely that Clinton will be the Democratic nominee. Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) has said she will not run, and Vice President Joe Biden says he ""hasn't made up [his] mind"" yet. Clinton will travel to Iowa and New Hampshire to make her case to voters almost immediately, CNN reports.

The findings come from a report released today by the security firm FireEye that chronicles the sustained operations of group it calls APT30 (the ""APT"" stands for ""advanced persistent threat"").  The group has been operating since at least 2005 FireEye says ""regionally focused"" cyber attacks in areas like Malaysia, Vietnam, Thailand, Nepal, Singapore, and Indonesia targeted both government and commercial outlets. Such attacks revealed the group's intimate knowledge of important military, economic, and political information about the targeted areas. The report says APT30 is notable because of the advanced style of its attacks and the sheer length of its operations: Our analysis of APT30 illuminates how a group can persistently compromise entities across an entire region and subcontinent, unabated, with little to no need to significantly change their modus operandi. Based on our malware research, we are able to assess how the team behind APT30 works: they prioritize their targets, most likely work in shifts in a collaborative environment, and build malware from a coherent development plan. Since 2005, the group has developed more than 200 versions of malware and carried out complex attacks on air-gapped networks, according to the report. Air-gapped network infections are not unusual, but according to FireEye's CTO Bryce Boland, it's rare for a group to have had that capability before 2008 or 2009. The malware was also very sophisticated, according to the report: APT30 malware includes the ability to steal information (such as specific file types), including, in some cases, the ability to infect removable drives with the potential to jump air gaps. Some malware includes commands to allow it to be placed in 'hide' mode and to remain stealthy on the victim host, presumably for long-term persistence. While TechCrunch notes that the Chinese government may be behind the attacks — Boland said ""all signs point to China"" — there is no piece of evidence that proves this unequivocally. FireEye says the nature of the targets as well as a code base likely created by Chinese developers hints at China's involvement. There is no definite evidence implicating the Chinese government FireEye found the group's main objective to be ""sensitive information theft for government espionage.""

The day the music industry and the internet became best frenemies forever. That's the day Metallica v. Napster, Inc. was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California — a case that would come to national prominence, pave the way for Steve Jobs and Apple to create the iTunes and iPod juggernaut, and ultimately lock the tech and media industries in a battle that rages on to this day. When Taylor Swift complains about Spotify, the arguments are an echo of Metallica v. Napster. When Jay Z, Beyoncé, Kanye, Rihanna, and all of their friends go on about Tidal, that's an echo of Metallica v. Napster. The internet upended the media industry, and it's still trying to recover. Metallica v. Napster was just the first attempt. Napster posed an existential threat to the music industry A very short history: in 1999, a kid named Shawn Fanning created a very simple peer-to-peer music sharing application called Napster. It was essentially just a glorified file browser; the barebones interface showed you MP3 files on various computers connected to the service and allowed you to download them. By default, your files were shared in return. This, of course, was illegal. You can't distribute copyrighted recordings, even if teenagers and music nerds have been making tapes and mixes forever. The difference was in scale; while handing out a few mixtapes to friends resulted mostly in the industry stamping ""HOME TAPING IS KILLING MUSIC"" on the backs of cassettes, Napster posed a very real existential threat: if everyone was getting and sharing music for free, no one would ever buy it. And for a band like Metallica, there were even worse repercussions: a leaked recording of the track ""I Disappear"" from the Mission: Impossible 2 soundtrack made its way onto Napster, and then onto the radio before its official release. This so incensed the band that it filed suit against the fledgling company, and drummer Lars Ulrich became an outspoken defender of artists facing the disruption of free internet distribution. ""Napster hijacked our music without asking."" ""Napster hijacked our music without asking,"" Ulrich told Congress in July 2000. ""They never sought our permission. Our catalog of music simply became available for free downloads on the Napster system."" Ulrich had a point, of course — but going up against millions of college students who had fallen in love with Napster wasn't an easy fight. He was pitted against the cherubic-looking Fanning in every argument, the millionaire metalhead drummer against the nerdy upstart kid, and Metallica's image went from counterculture outsiders to boardroom power players almost overnight. Napster lost, of course. It was always going to lose, even if the legal demands levied by Metallica and the RIAA were so onerous as to be impossible. (One hundred percent copyright filtering accuracy? Good luck.) In March 2001, Judge Marilyn Hall Patel ordered a preliminary injunction forcing Napster to filter music, and in July of that year a proposed settlement was thrown out because Napster's CEO used to work for the music industry, tainting the deal. Napster went bankrupt, and now it's gone forever, absorbed into Rhapsody after a series of deals. (If you want to know more about this, the excellent documentary Downloaded is on Netflix right now.) But while Napster flamed out in just two short years, the media / internet debate has relentlessly burned on ever since: Sony wanting a cut of Apple's iPod sales in addition to its iTunes revenue. The fight over music DRM, eventually won by Jobs himself, even while video DRM still lives on. Pandora wanting different rates than regular radio stations. YouTube building an empire on pirated video clips, getting sued by Viacom, and then revealing Viacom itself had been uploading many of those clips. The years-long march to Spotify launching in the United States. SOPA. PIPA. Artists turning their backs on Spotify to drop full albums exclusively on rival platforms like iTunes and Tidal. Apple buying Beats and negotiating for music exclusives, just like it did a decade ago. The endless haggling to put real TV service on the internet. It's never-ending, and all of it started with Napster and Metallica, 15 years ago. ""We weren't quite prepared for the shitstorm that we became engulfed in,"" Ulrich told The Huffington Post in 2013.

The court recently voided the scheduled execution dates of four inmates in response to concerns about the state's lethal injection protocol. In a court order filed last week, the state said all upcoming executions would be delayed until a trial court could comment on judicial challenges raised by the inmates. Currently, each of the four death row inmates has legal action pending against the state that questions the constitutionality of lethal injection. The inmates' executions were scheduled to occur between October of this year and March 2016, the Post reports, and their suspension has momentarily ceased all capital punishment in the state. The state has a backup plan: electrocution Tennessee is the most recent of several US states to nullify scheduled executions. Last September, Oklahoma halted capital punishment following a botched lethal injection. Early this year, Ohio postponed state-sanctioned execution because it ran out of the two-drug cocktail used for lethal injection. The largest group of pharmacists in the US recently drafted a policy asking members to refrain from providing prisons with chemicals used for executions. However, there is no single drug used nationwide for lethal injections. States use one-, two-, and three-drug cocktails, while the chemicals used and the order in which they are administered vary. Arizona and Oklahoma have both faced pushback for the use of the midazolam as a sedative, because it has no pain-relieving properties. Tennessee's injection protocol currently calls for a single drug, the sedative pentobarbital. An affidavit submitted recently on the inmates' behalf suggests that shortages will prevent the state from getting the pentobarbital it needs, the AP reports. Last year, Tennessee expanded its use of the electric chair as a way to head off the drug shortage, the Post reports. Lethal injection is still the default method of execution in the state, but electrocution will be used if the courts deem lethal injection unconstitutional, or the influx of drugs dries up. After the trial court weighs in, the state Supreme Court will ""exercise its authority to set new dates of execution"" for the four inmates.",0.4799154369572175,0.5200845630427825,0.9350416327554432,368,5.3967391304347823,209,6.2535885167464116,0,0,"Policy & Law, US & World"

The two companies recently inked a content distribution deal that will bring some of Beatport's curated playlists and exclusive content to Spotify. The move may sound like a strange one — Beatport is, ostensibly, a Spotify competitor — but each service has something the other wants. Spotify has reach; Beatport has insider status and a human touch. Beatport has been around since 2004; it began as an online download store aimed at dance music aficionados, and has since expanded to streaming and video. In 2013, Beatport was acquired by SFX, the live music company behind big EDM festivals like Electric Zoo. Earlier this year, Skrillex and Diplo's 24-hour DJ set was hosted by Beatport and Twitch. The human touch It's not clear exactly what the partnership will look like, but Spotify will have access to Beatport's exclusive DJ mixes and videos of live events. Beatport's team will also create ""highly curated"" playlists for Spotify. Spotify has had some level of human curation for the past few years, but its themed playlists mostly feel cold and robotic. Earlier this year, Spotify gave teen superband One Direction some curation power for a weekend, but this is Spotify's first attempt at long-running, personalized curation from an outside team. The pairing is likely an attempt to keep up with Apple Music, another player in the streaming world that's already cemented itself as a big threat to Spotify. One of Apple Music's biggest draws is its curated content, which lets users listen to songs that have been hand-picked by industry insiders and artists. It makes sense for Spotify to try to get a little bit of that personal touch for itself, and Beatport has always positioned itself as a tastemaker rather than a powerhouse. ""It's a curated and playlist market,"" Greg Consiglio, Beatport's CEO, told Billboard. ""Our service is heavily curated, by people in our company — in our Denver and Berlin and LA offices — who have label relationships and artist relationships. We have a unique perspective on what's trending."" Beatport focuses exclusively on electronic music, so it's possible this is just the first step on Spotify's path to a more curated world.

The only other comedy cohort that has come close to such total anarchy is the South Park team, but Wain & Co. aren't as invested in topicality (though they are as enamored with the tropes of musical theatre). Even edgy topical humor is something that could be ripe for mockery by a Stella short. Wet Hot American Summer worked because on the surface it had fully committed to being a bawdy summer comedy, but it was throwing absolute nonsense in at every moment where there should have been stakes, with no consideration for the repercussions for its ""characters' arcs."" Who is Jim Stansel — just ""that guy""? What makes Netflix's prequel series Wet Hot American Summer: First Day of Camp so doubly insane is that so much of it is built around trying to explain that nonsense. For anyone who has cultishly memorized every line of the original film, no matter how meaningless (guilty), the rewards are plentiful: Why didn't Henry get tenure? Who is Jim Stansel — just ""that guy""? Why does that can of vegetables speak with Jon Benjamin's voice? For newcomers — or even people who saw the film once, thought it was weird and funny, and never felt the urge to obsessively revisit it — I have to wonder how much appeal there will be for fan service as all-encompassing as this. Thankfully, there are enough cameos and stunt castings to merit a steady clip of ""holy shit""s. (Most of these have been announced, but even if you're aware of them I promise they will still pop up when you least expect them, and therefore I feel obligated not to spoil them. Yes, there are three Mad Men alums in this show, and they are deployed perfectly.)     But even the returning cast is a stunt in and of itself: the original ensemble (which includes current-day big-timers Amy Poehler, Elizabeth Banks, Bradley Cooper, and Paul Rudd, among countless others) were already well past their teenage years in 2001; in the first episode of First Day of Camp, their even more aged faces and bodies are the bulk of the humor — Poehler in particular seems to have a great time saying ""I'm 16 years old"" with utter sincerity at any given opportunity. It's a fine way to establish the absolute absurdity of the ""world"" of the show, but after the first couple of episodes — which also lingered on a couple sleepy storylines about the campers themselves — the story luckily moves on to richer, more unexpected territory. Beyond the inside jokes, WHAS:FDoC succeeds because it doubles up on the nothing-is-sacred promise of the film, and proceeds to absorb every beat, cliché, or overused trope ever put to film in its [Andy voice:] ""whatever, man"" orbit. Let's be clear: there are now just short of four hours of First Day of Camp, versus 97 minutes including credits of Wet Hot American Summer. With that amount of runtime, the series is obligated to expand beyond the confines of Camp Firewood, and even Waterville, Maine. Imagine the still-perfect ""going into town"" sequence from the film, except reimagined as a conspiracy thriller, spy suspense, middle-aged romantic comedy, courtroom procedural, and journalist-with-a-hot-scoop-who-gets-in-over-their-head drama.      And as any prequel is wont to do, it becomes an origin story. Not that even the most diehard fans were clamoring to find out what made Coop, Katie, Andy, Lindsay, McKinley, Ben, Beth, Abby Bernstein, Victor Pulak, the Indoor Kids, or the anonymously evil Camp Tiger Claw the people they were by the last day of camp — it doesn't matter; origin stories are just another structural element for Wain & Co. to render ridiculous. The most hilariously involved threads are of Vietnam-scarred, fridge-humping Gene (the god Christopher Meloni) and makeout slut Lindsay (Elizabeth Banks). But the most ingenious is of Andy (Rudd), who has been recast as the hero of the show (inasmuch as one can be in such a crowded, talented ensemble). The First Day of Camp finds Michael Showalter's Coop in the same underdog position as he was in during the film, fighting to win Katie's (Marguerite Moreau) heart from some undeserving, socially superior asshole, and Rudd's still definitely the same Andy, wafting farts into Katie's face as a means of courtship (and Rudd is obviously the least-aged of any of the cast here), but now Andy's a genuine antihero. That so much of the original ensemble (and equally many newcomers) would show up for this just-as-rink-a-dink Netflix show is evidence of the impact WHAS had on a generation of self-aware comedians. The comedy of Wet Hot American Summer, and Stella, and even parts of The State is a comedy of second-to-second paranoia — every now and then it lulls you into being invested in what's happening, before yanking the rug out from under you. Wain doesn't want you to think he's taking any of this seriously — even the desire to be funny. It's a kind of escape clause: nothing is stupid, because everything is stupid. To sustain that over the course of eight serialized episodes would seem like a recipe for implosion, but no matter how self-defeating it pretends to be, First Day of Camp can't help pushing outward, into weirder terrain that no conventional sitcom — streaming or otherwise — would ever be allowed to go. If you're a diehard, it will play out like a fan-fic stranger and more elaborate than anything even in the furthest reaches of Tumblr. If you're a newcomer, well, Paul Rudd's in it. And he's funny.",0.43654583893758475,0.5634541610624153,0.152935773075751,1077,4.8254410399257193,589,6.2071307300509337,0,4,"Culture, Entertainment, TV, TV Review"

The new desktop release includes a new ""colorful"" theme that's identical to the latest Mac, iOS, and Android apps. It's also similar to the Windows 10 touch-optimized versions of Office, with a colored look that matches the Word, Excel, and PowerPoint applications. The new colorful option arrives alongside a dark theme for those who dislike the traditional look of Microsoft's Office apps. Microsoft is improving Outlook 2016 search, attachments, storage footprint, and email delivery performance, alongside some improvements to image insertion in Word 2016 and Excel 2016. Perhaps the biggest change in Word allows for real-time co-authoring within the desktop version of Office 2016.

The four-button (on/off, dim up/down) dimmer can be stuck to the wall just like the Hue Tap wireless switch. And like Tap, it can be popped out of the wall plate for use as a remote control. However, unlike Tap, Philip’s new dimmer is powered by a thin CR2450 battery instead of the kinetic energy generated each time you press a Tap button. That will make the dimmer feel more like a traditional switch since you don’t have to forcefully mash the buttons to generate power. It’s also notably thinner than the $59.95 Tap as a result (11mm vs. 25mm) and costs just $39.95 for the dimmer and one Philips Hue warm white (2700K) bulb which usually costs $19.95 when purchased separately. Prevents family members from inadvertently cutting the power Best of all, it’s just the right size to replace traditional wired dimmers and switches. While Philips doesn’t encourage it, there’s nothing to stop owners with basic electrical skills from removing their existing switch and faceplate from the wall, capping off the existing wires, and using the new dimmers to cover the hole. This prevents family members from inadvertently cutting the power to light sockets and thus rendering Hue bulbs useless to apps, IFTTT commands, and any other intelligence you add to your home.   Philips promises smooth, flicker-free, buzz-free, and instant-on control over as many as 10 Hue bulbs — something that’s not guaranteed if you’ve ever tried pairing a cheap dimmer with certain LEDs. It’s also ""future-proof,"" according to Philips, which means it can be upgraded when connected to the company’s Bridge hub (not included). In other words, it’ll work with HomeKit when Philips opens the door to Apple in the fall. So really, unless you want mushy push-button access to scenes, there’s very little reason you’d ever want to purchase the Tap now that the smarter, smaller, and cheaper Hue dimmer has arrived. Look for it in all the usual places around North America when it ships in September.

A video from Android Police shows the flaw in action, with the outlet reporting that stylus detection remained permanently broken after its tests. A similar story from Ars Technica found the same issue, but with the caveat that the reporter was able to get the features working again after some judicious wiggling of the S Pen inside the smartphone.  The flaw is particularly annoying because of the ease with which the S Pen can be inserted into the Note 5 the wrong way.

Over the last few years, its OM-D line of cameras was one of the first to offer affordable mirrorless cameras with advanced controls, and many other companies followed suit. Olympus then took aim at the more casual photographer last year when it introduced the E-M10 — a tiny, mirrorless, Micro Four Thirds camera that offered a ton of power for relatively cheap. Now, it has announced a successor to its entry-level model: the E-M10 Mark II. What Olympus has done this time around is take the great build quality of the E-M10 and make it even better, while throwing in a few new standout features like 5-axis image stabilization. The E-M10 Mark II is still incredibly small — about the size of Sony's RX100, though this definitely won't fit in your pocket — and also very light. It's a striking addition to the low end of its OM-D lineup of cameras, and should make for an attractive option in a crowded mirrorless camera market.   Olympus outfitted the first version of the E-M10 with a metal frame, while many of its competitors in price and size were still fiddling with cheaper-feeling plastic. And the company has one-upped itself when it comes to the build of the E-M10 Mark II. The new version adds studded metal to the camera's knobs which — instead of lying flat on the top of the camera like on the original E-M10 — shoot up about half an inch to make them easier to reach. All three are now on the right side of the camera (the power and flash switch is now found on the top left), and their slightly different designs make it easy to know which knob you're gripping without making you take your eye off the subject.   As for while you're shooting, the E-M10 Mark II is very capable. It has a much better electronic viewfinder than the original E-M10, with a resolution of 2.36 million dots — the same as on Fujifilm's X-T10 and X-T1. (Although, in my brief time with the E-M10 Mark II, the upgraded EVF wasn't quite as impressive as Fujifilm's.) The Mark II starts up fast, can burst shoot RAW or JPEG images up to 8.5 times per second (even in quiet shutter mode), and has a really quick autofocus. Like many photography-first mirrorless cameras, the E-M10 Mark II isn't terribly powerful when it comes to video. Instead, it still feels like an add-on. It's capable of taking 1080p video at 60, 30, or 24 frames per second, but there's no 4K capability, and you can't shoot in slow motion at full HD resolution. Not everyone needs these kinds of features, so this might be enough for most photographers who need to shoot the occasional video. But it's a shame that there aren't more power features considering Olympus included the 5-axis stabilization, which is a big deal when it comes to video. The rest of the E-M10 Mark II is very similar to its predecessor. There's a pop-up flash, a tilting 3-inch LCD screen, and the same 16-megapixel sensor. And all of this similarity is not a bad thing, because the original E-M10 was an impressive camera, especially considering that much of its competition hovers around or above the $1,000 mark. The E-M10 Mark II will contend much in the same way, because Olympus is once again aggressively pricing its entry-level mirrorless camera. The company will sell the camera body only in the United States for $649, and is packaging it with a 14-42mm f/3.5-5.6 kit lens for $799. The E-M10 Mark II will also be sold in Canada, and the two configurations will cost $749 and $899, respectively. All options will be available in early September, according to Olympus.

A new genetic analysis of the country has revealed which invading force had the greatest impact on its DNA. The UK can be split into 17 genetically distinct groups Britons share the most DNA with people from France and Germany — countries which were home to the Angles and Saxons that moved into the British Isles after Roman rule collapsed in the 4th century. And despite broad similarities, the UK can be split into 17 distinct genetic groups that correspond to modern regions, according to a paper published in Nature that analyzed genetic data from more than 2,000 individuals in the UK and more than 6,000 across Europe. ""It’s really the first time that scientists have looked in great detail within a country at patterns of genetic variation,"" said Peter Donnelly, a professor of statistical science at the University of Oxford and one of the paper's lead authors. The genetic data was collected from Caucasians living in rural areas. Scientists selected people whose grandparents were all born within 80 kilometers of each other. ""Because we inherit DNA from our parents,"" said Donnelly, ""and they inherit their DNA from their parents... If was as if we were able to sample DNA from the population at the time the grandparents were born, and that’s roughly in the late 1800s.""  A map of the UK showing genetic clusters. Each combination of shape and color represents a distinct group. Image credit: Stephen Leslie. This method allowed the scientists to focus on early influences on the British population and ignore the upheavals in the 20th century caused by increasing urbanization. Once the genetic data had been compiled — a process that took 20 years — it was then sorted into clusters based on differences and similarities in the DNA. Of all the forces that invaded Britain, only the Anglo-Saxons had a lasting genetic effect, the study showed. Individuals in the study shared almost 30 percent of their DNA with people from what is now Germany, while those in the south and central parts of England shared around 40 percent of their DNA with people from the French region. what happened after the romans left? This data also helps solve the dispute over what happened in the 4th century when the Romans left Britain and the Anglo-Saxons moved in. ""What we know from the historical evidence is that society collapsed,"" said archaeologist Mark Robinson, an author on the paper. ""What was Roman Britain essentially became a failed state with warlords fighting each other and economic decline."" Historians have suggested the Anglo-Saxons that subsequently moved in purged the Romano-British people, a theory supported by the sudden shift in culture such as the changing in pottery to Germanic styles. However, the shared genetics between individuals in central England and Europe suggests that the integration was more peaceful. ""It is not genocide or complete disappearance of Britons,"" said Robinson. That’s in contrast to the Danish Vikings who ruled the same central swath of Britain from around the 9th century but left little genetic mark on the population. This suggests their power came from a ruling military elite, rather than a large-scale movement of settlers. ""genetics tells us about the vast bulk of people."" ""It’s interesting when you think about the sources of information we have for this kind of history,"" said Donnelly. ""All of those sources [such as the archaeological and written records] predominantly tell us about the successful and ruling elite in society…. But what genetics tells us about is what’s happening to the vast bulk of people, to the masses, rather than to the elite."" Not only did the data align with historical events, but also political and cultural divides. For example, the population of Orkney (a set of small islands off the northeast coast of Scotland) was found to be the most genetically distinct from the rest of the UK, with a quarter of the residents' DNA coming from Norwegian ancestors. This fits the historical record, since Orkney was settled by Norwegian Vikings around 800 AD, and remained part of their country for the next 600 years. However, even certain parts of mainland Britain — such as Wales, on the Western flank of the country — were found to be distinct from the rest of the UK. The Welsh are also the closest genetic match to the first settlers in Britain following the end of the last Ice Age, around 10,000 years ago. century-old genetic divides ""almost exactly match the modern county boundaries"" Clear genetic divides were also found between populations living very close to one another. Genetics differences between neighboring Devon and Cornwall, for example, ""almost exactly match the modern county boundaries,"" according to Donnelly. The power of politics over genetics is most clearly shown in the data from the center and south of England. Historically, this area had tended to be brought under the rule of a single invading force — first by the Romans, for example, and then later by the Anglo-Saxons. Robinson suggests that this is reflected in the fact that the largest genetically cohesive in the study (containing almost half the individuals analyzed) is found in this region. Because the invading forces broke down geopolitical boundaries, says Robinson, it ""homogenized genetic signals in that area."" ""This [sort of genetic changes] doesn't need people to move a long way away, "" explains Robinson, it just needs a little bit of movement over many generations.",0.5607392643159669,0.4392607356840331,0.8872221892961121,930,5.0677419354838706,456,6.2171052631578947,0,2,Science

The brown paper packaging that enveloped it was standard for US mail at the time, and its contents provided no indication — no ticking clock, no lit fuse, no clicking sound — of the explosion to come. Resting on the kitchen counter that separated Dr. James V. McConnell from his graduate student assistant, Nicklaus Suino, it awakened no suspicions. Even the bomb’s trigger was subtle: all it took was for Suino to reach across the counter and touch the clear fiber tape that held it together. Despite their proximity to the explosion, both McConnell and Suino survived. The young graduate student suffered minor injuries and was kept at the local hospital overnight; McConnell experienced mild hearing loss. ""It was quite traumatic at the time,"" Suino recalls. ""Dr. McConnell and I both developed shock reactions to loud noises afterward."" McConnell was the target of Theodore ""the Unabomber"" Kaczynski’s 10th bomb. Why would Kaczynski, a man obsessed by a quest to rid the world of threats from modern technology and science, go after a psychology professor at a Michigan university? Some thought it had to do with a prediction McConnell had made in the ‘70s, when he suggested that prisoners would one day be conditioned out of anti-social behavior. But McConnell was also famous for something else: in the ‘50s and ‘60s, McConnell had performed a series of memory experiments at the University of Michigan while Kaczynski was a student there — experiments that earned him a reputation as a kooky, arrogant, and deeply misguided academic who challenged everything we think we know about memory. McConnell’s radical research suggested that memories could exist outside the brain — and even be transferred between organisms. The conclusions were so outlandish and dystopian that some speculated they attracted Kaczynski’s ire. But James McConnell may have been right. McConnell’s experiments have largely faded from scientific memory — those that remember him tend to use him as a cautionary tale. But at the end of the ‘50s, McConnell was a big deal: his charismatic personality, combined with his controversial scientific accomplishments, landed him on TV more than once, notably on The Steve Allen Show. Instead of dazzling audiences with complicated science, McConnell captivated them with awe-inspiring concepts. In fact, the experiment that brought him his first taste of national fame was remarkably simple. In a 1959 study, McConnell sought to demonstrate that memories could be stored in cells outside the brain. To do so, he enlisted the help of the common freshwater flatworm, Dugesia dorotocephala. Flatworms were ideal because, like mammals and unlike, say, jellyfish, they have a centralized brain. They also have an exceptional ability to regenerate themselves from tiny morsels of flesh: sever the tip of a flatworm’s tail, and within 14 days you’ll have an entirely new specimen, fully equipped with a brand new brain. Moreover, flatworms can be taught to perform certain behaviors. Researchers can use electrical shocks to teach them to respond to lighting cues by moving to a particular part of a petri dish. That is, flatworms can be trained to remember a behavior and perform it on cue. If McConnell demonstrated that the lowly flatworm could recall its training after its head had been cut off, and its brain had grown anew, the experiment would show that memories could live outside the brain. ""We didn’t know what the tail would remember, if anything, for it had to grow an entirely new brain, new eyes, and almost an entire new nervous system,"" McConnell wrote in a 1965 collection of science-related articles entitled The Worm Re-Turns. But, according to McConnell’s study, they did remember. The regenerated worms were able to recall the behaviors they had learned to execute under certain lighting conditions. ""The tail regenerates,"" McConnell wrote, and ""showed as good a memory of the original task as did the heads."" Published in the Journal of Comparative and Physiological Psychology, a highly regarded psychology journal, the study earned McConnell a lot of press, with mentions in Time, Medical World News, Newsweek, and Fortune. ""Almost at once the mail began to come in asking for details,"" McConnell wrote. But the fantastic takeaway of McConnell’s study — that cells other than neurons could store information — caused many to question the study’s methodology and conclusions. In 1960, he published a second experiment, one that pushed his theories far beyond what anyone would have imagined. This one left the scientific community completely stumped. Widely known as ""the cannibalism experiment,"" the study tested another McConnell theory: that memory could be transferred chemically from one flatworm to another through something called ""memory-RNA."" Memory-RNA, McConnell suggested, was a special form of RNA — the intermediary form of genetic information that fills the gap between DNA and proteins — that could store long-term memories outside the brain. His method was unorthodox, to say the least: McConnell fed bits of trained flatworms to their untrained brethren. As a result, McConnell claimed, the untrained flatworms performed behaviors that the trained flatworms had previously learned. In short, the dead flatworms’ memories had found a new home. ""Biologists and chemists said ‘no way,’"" recalls Reeva Kimble, who did undergraduate research for McConnell in 1959 and 1960. Reeva later married Daniel Kimble, the student who gathered data for McConnell’s first regeneration experiment. McConnell’s opponents couldn’t make sense of his findings. For them, ""there was no mechanism to understand his result, so it had to be hogwash,"" Reeva says. McConnell’s cannibalism experiment was greeted with intense skepticism. Groups of researchers at competing universities did their best to replicate his study in order to disprove his work; if the study couldn’t be replicated, it would be enough to expunge his ideas from scientific memory. Some researchers reported obtaining similar results when recreating McConnell’s study, but many didn’t. Others (rightly) faulted him for his small sample size and because the effect he reported was, albeit significant, relatively weak. Still, replicating work in which a human observes animal behavior precisely and manually is extremely difficult, and McConnell’s conclusion was never fully debunked. For his part, McConnell insisted that other scientists failed to reproduce his findings because no one was able to fully recreate the conditions of his experiment. Eventually, however, the psychologist’s work was cast aside, or referred to as ""a failure."" McConnell’s hobbies didn’t do much to strengthen his scientific credibility. He liked writing, science and humor, so he combined them in The Worm Runner’s Digest — a ""scientific journal"" that he used to reach the masses following the publication of his 1959 flatworm study. The journal contained real studies, but they were featured alongside poems, cartoons, and humorous takes on scientific research penned by colleagues and students. As a result, outsiders complained that they couldn’t tell the difference between the scientific subject matter and its more humorous content. ""We’ve insisted that the Digest be a mixture of fact and fun, for it seems to me that anyone who takes himself, or his work, too seriously is in a perilous state of mental health,"" McConnell wrote in 1965, in a compilation of the Digest’s articles. This attitude made him popular among his students, but failed to inspire confidence among his peers. ""He was very frustrated with people not taking him seriously,"" Suino remembered during a conversation in 2013. McConnell was disappointed with the dismantling of his memory work, he said. ""I think that he felt that a lot of people who went into his research with a bias against it.""  Why were McConnell’s ideas so unsettling? What he was proposing — the existence of a chemical memory trace that encodes training information in flatworms — is nothing short of astounding. Supposing that McConnell was correct, it would mean that the flatworm brain is capable of storing information in chemical structures which can be transferred to other parts of the body. Moreover, these chemical structures could form a ""language"" for memories that can cater to an infinite number of situations — and that other organisms can ""read."" The chemical transfer theory goes against current and past conceptions of memory. Aristotle, for example, likened memory to a wax tablet in the mind upon which a person imprints knowledge and recollection as time goes by. The impact of that explanation has been profound and long-lasting; many point to it as the source of the ""young, impressionable mind"" trope. Science has since moved on from the wax tablet analogy, of course. Currently, biologists believe that information is stored in neural networks in the brain, in the connections that allow information to be transmitted from one neuron to the next. That’s as far as most researchers are willing to go when discussing the underpinnings of memory, however. Press a scientist to tell you how memories are encoded and decoded in the brain, and you’ll soon find that the scientific community doesn’t have an answer. How do our brains represent memories like seeing X-rays for the first time? The question is so difficult to tackle that many researchers have chosen to focus on determining what sorts of modifications take place in the brain when memory is stored instead — changes in neuron structure, for example — in the hopes that they might reverse-engineer memory formation. But looking at modifications in the brain isn’t the same as figuring out how memory is encoded, or where it's stored. Whoever finds the vault where we keep our memories is bound to go down in history. Michael Levin doesn’t recall the first time he encountered McConnell’s 1959 memory study, but he remembers his reaction to it. ""I came across a primary paper of McConnell showing that memory can survive regeneration, and I thought, ‘Well this is extremely profound because it really speaks to the ability of all tissues — those outside the head anyway — to store memories.’"" Levin, a developmental biologist at Tufts University, is well known for his work on limb regeneration; his studies have been featured in the Journal of Neuroscience and on the cover of Cell. One of his most well-known experiments demonstrated that it’s possible to trigger limb growth in young frogs by giving them a drug cocktail. He’s also recognized for figuring out how to grow a working tadpole eye in a location other than the head — namely on the tail and back. ""He’s really well-known in the field of amphibian regeneration,"" says Alejandro Sanchez Alvarado, a developmental biologist at Stowers Institute for Medical Research. ""I don’t know of anybody doing work remotely similar to what Mike is doing."" But a few years ago, Levin took on a side project. After stumbling upon McConnell’s work, he decided to take the basic principles behind the psychologist’s first memory experiment and try it out for himself. After all, there were already vast amounts of literature on aneural organisms — organisms that don’t have a brain to begin with — that can learn, so he thought McConnell might have been at least partially right. ""Everything from plants, to slime molds, to single-cell organisms can learn, even sperm can learn to run mazes,"" Levin says. But unlike those creatures, flatworms possess a ""true brain"" — a centralized nervous system located in their triangle-shaped heads. This makes them a lot more like humans than most of us are willing to admit. It took four years and over a million dollars to recreate and improve upon McConnell’s experiment. In an effort to sidestep the criticism his predecessor faced, Levin developed a rigorously documented, replicable experimentation method. Part of that was done by the invention of a machine, called the ""Automatic Training Apparatus,"" that could train and track the movements of multiple flatworms without human intervention. Late last year, I traveled to Medford, Massachusetts — just outside Boston — to visit Levin in his lab at Tufts University. Simpsons figurines, mugs, and blankets dot his office; a three-eyed plastic fish watches over him from the bookshelf. Word got around one day that the researcher liked the show. Now the toys just keep coming in; the students think it’s funny. Eventually, Levin took me to a small room a few doors from his office to see the ""Automatic Training Apparatus."" There, I watched Moran Neuhof, a visiting student from Israel, put 12 petri dishes — each filled with a flatworm — into Levin’s machine. Pointing to a computer screen, Neuhof told me to observe an image of a worm as it moved inside a petri dish. Red targets tracked the worms as they swam around; an invisible grid helped translate their movement into time-stamped coordinates along the way. This is how Levin was able to objectively train the worms and record their behaviors, without ever having to be in the same room. Designing the Automatic Training Apparatus ""was a nightmare,"" Levin says. Flatworms are tiny and quick, and they love to hang off the sides of a petri dish instead of swimming at the bottom — all of which makes them tough to track with a camera. The researcher collaborated with several engineering firms to make an apparatus capable of simultaneously, and autonomously, tracking and recording the movements of 12 worms. Minimizing human participation was critical — a fully automated process was meant to protect Levin’s results from the scrutiny McConnell faced. ""If you don’t believe me, you can take the tracking data and the Quicktime movies,"" Levin says. ""Analyze it yourself, and see what you think of whether they behaved correctly or not."" The training protocol Levin devised is simple, but elegant: Flatworms are cautious and like to explore their environment, so when they’re introduced to food in a new location, they tend to circle it for a long time before feeding, Levin says. This means that scientists can use ""latency of feeding"" — the time the worms take to approach a food item — as an indication of how well they remember a specific environment. If they remember that the environment is secure, or that it only contains one source of food, then they don’t need to explore it; they can go straight for the food. So, Levin trained them to recognise the textured petri dishes. Once the worms learned to recognize the rough floors of the dish, they started going for the food more quickly. Then, Levin and his team cut off their heads. Two weeks later, the researchers re-introduced the worms, now armed with new heads, into the dish, but only for a short period of of time. This shortened re-introduction is meant to signal to the brain that the memory stored in the flatworm’s trunk is still relevant, Levin says. The next day, the worms were finally re-tested. ""Worms that had never before associated the roughness with the liver, took a long time to approach the food, and worms that had been trained went straight for the liver — that’s the difference,"" Levin says. The Tufts University researcher has yet to establish a mechanism to explain his findings, which he published in the Journal of Experimental Biology in 2013. He hypothesizes that memories could spread beyond the brain thanks to electrical charges generated by cells in the rest of the body. But until more research is conducted, it’s hard to know what to make of his results. Other mechanisms have been suggested. Eva Jablonka, a developmental biologist who studies the evolution of nervous systems at Tel Aviv University, thinks that small RNAs might be involved. Small RNAs are short copies of DNA that aren’t translated into proteins. When the flatworm learns a behavior, the brain chemistry changes, and it’s possible these changes alter small RNAs, Jablonka says. Because these molecules can migrate between cells, altered small RNAs could end up in stems cells that remain in the decapitated worm. When the worm’s head grows back, the small RNAs migrate back to the head, changing the brain’s chemistry and allowing it to learn certain behaviors more quickly. If true, the memory that Levin thinks is stored outside the brain wouldn’t be memory at all. Rather, the small RNAs would allow the flatworms to recover a brain ""environment"" that helps them learn a specific behavior more quickly. But this scenario, Jablonka says, ""is still imaginary."" At this point, any attempt to explain Levin’s results is problematic. The truth is that we don’t know if Levin’s conclusions are even remotely correct. It’s still possible that, like McConnell’s work, Levin’s study is flawed in some unidentified way. It’s also possible that the flatworm’s unique regenerative abilities lie behind its ability to recall memories after growing a new brain. In that case, flatworms may be the only species with a central nervous system that can store memories outside of the brain. ""I find that highly unlikely,"" Levin says, ""but it’s a possibility."" Even if storing memory outside of the brain is universal among animals, that storage method might only work for simple pieces of information. Complex memories like the significance of the word ""truth"" or ""caring"" might not have a place beyond the brain. But if there is a small chance that the experiment is reproducible, and that this isn’t a trait reserved to some tiny insignificant worm, the impact could be revolutionary. ""I think [this work] will start a renaissance in human memory,"" says Oné Pagán, a planarian expert and pharmacologist at West Chester University. ""Levin is one of the top researchers in developmental biology, so if anybody can pull it off, he can."" Levin’s work could completely alter the way we think of memory, with real-world applications, Pagán says. The new flatworm studies could one day lead to novel Alzheimer’s disease treatments. In neurodegenerative diseases, ""there’s a certain destruction of cellular structures that deal with memory,"" he says. So, ""if memory is stored outside the actual brain, that opens the door for people to potentially fully or partially recover those memories"" following stem cell therapies, for instance. Studies of flatworm memory recall could also give rise to new architectures for storing data and biological memories in computers. If information can be stored in many different types of cells, for example, then creating a robotic prosthetic with parts that can perform as computational devices — independently from others — might be within reach. Machines would be more robust, because a glitch in their central processors wouldn’t necessarily lead to a complete loss of function; other ""smart"" parts could pick up the slack, and maybe even help the robot fix itself. Finally, Levin’s findings could one day help researchers activate limb regeneration and wound-healing in humans. ""Let’s say that you lost a big part of your liver,"" Jablonka says — ""if we were able to introduce the kinds of molecules that will help your body regenerate this liver, that would be a great thing!"" As with McConnell, the mass media has demonstrated intense interest in Levin’s study, with articles appearing in Scientific American, National Geographic, NPR, Wired UK, and here at The Verge, to name a few. ""The worms’ memories were just as accurate as those worms who had never lost their heads,"" explained Carrie Arnold at National Geographic. ""So these worms grew new heads with old memories, a remarkable finding,"" wrote Robert Krulwich at NPR. Levin’s study showed that ""it’s clear the action is happening somewhere outside of the brain,"" exclaimed Wired UK’s Liat Clark. But the scientific community’s reaction to a revival of McConnell’s work has been mixed. ""I think it’s a fine piece of work,"" Alvarado says. ""The data that [Levin] obtained seems like a reasonable consequence of his manipulation."" Jablonka also thinks Levin’s methodology is sound. ""He automatized the experiment so they can follow a lot of animals at once,"" she says. ""Michael is a very original scientist."" ""Levin’s [study] was done in such an exquisite way,"" Pagán says. ""With appropriate controls and no human bias."" And Scott Rawls, a pharmacologist who works with flatworms at Temple University in Philadelphia, agrees. ""From a mechanistic perspective, I think he covered the bases and did the experiment pretty well."" Others are less enthusiastic. ""The paper from Tufts might be right, but they still haven’t quite done the experiment in a way that really convinces you,"" says Robert Kentridge, a psychologist at Durham University in the UK. What Levin has yet to do is show that the transfer is memory-specific, he says. ""The effect of stress could have the same consequences as learning."" What Levin might have picked up on is behavior induced by a stress hormone, itself triggered by the texturized petri dishes Levin used. A superior experiment would have eliminated that possibility by training flatworms to also recognize an un-textured petri dish, he says. ""That would have shown that what’s being transferred is quite specific and has nothing to do with a dish that might be ‘stressful.’"" Kentridge isn’t alone in thinking that the study could have been better designed. Noelle L’etoile, a cellular biologist and nematode researcher at UC-San Francisco, says that Levin should have studied more variables and other forms of stimuli. The fact that the training protocol relied on a textured petri dish might have contributed to the results in ways that we don’t yet understand, she says. The rough surface could have altered the neuron circuits that allow the worm to move, which would in turn help the worm get around more easily inside a petri dish. Those altered circuits might also become more efficient after training, she ventures. It’s crucial that other groups of researchers tackle this study, L’etoile says. Levin should give his machine, or the design for his machine, to other groups to see if they can reproduce the findings. If they can show that Levin’s results don’t stem from a series of flukes, it would ""go a long way to support his contention that he has found something,"" she says. L’etoile readily admits that McConnell’s failures continue to loom large over Levin’s study. It’s a ""cautionary tale in the field of experimental biology"" — one that comes with ""a lot of baggage,"" she says. The fact that so many research groups had trouble replicating flatworm training protocols in the ‘60s and ‘70s means that the bar to convince her has been set very high, she says. ""I think I have a great deal of skepticism about [flatworm] training."" Five years after the Unabomber attack, at the age of 64, James McConnell suffered a heart attack, and passed away. An obituary printed in The New York Times mentioned both his controversial experiments and the Worm Runner’s Digest, which the author said ""often needled his colleagues."" Neither Suino nor the Kimbles attended James McConnell’s funeral, but his friends and colleagues remember him still. ""He was the person who convinced me to go to graduate school,"" Reeva Kimble says. Despite the criticism he faced, McConnell’s showmanship and larger-than-life ideas resonated with his students. He was the researcher who showed them that science could be light-hearted and fun. He was also the researcher who didn’t back down when he was challenged for making outlandish claims. ""I think what [McConnell] was right about is that one should pay attention to these unusual things on the fringes of science that can disrupt the current way of thinking,"" Levin says. McConnell’s ideas were set aside, seemingly forgotten, for half a century. That’s not unique; scientific ideas are regularly abandoned, in favor of more sensible, simple proposals. But science has demonstrated more than once that what humans perceive as being ""simple"" isn’t always biologically simple. Our ideas are partly informed by culture — a culture that, in this case, believes firmly in the brain as the center of our physiological and psychological universe. This is undoubtedly correct. But it might not be the whole story. Like dormant memories, James McConnell’s ideas have resurfaced. What science does with them now will depend on Levin and his peers, as they try to prove that the results are wrong — in a counter-intuitive effort to show that maybe McConnell was right. Should they succeed in poking holes in Levin’s study, McConnell and his flatworms will likely remain a cautionary tale. But if they fail, James McConnell will be remembered, forever, as a pioneer.",0.6390990635134477,0.3609009364865523,0.8419309893962774,4025,5.2156521739130435,1583,6.901452937460518,0,20,

Scientists investigating the effects of the common parasite Pleistophora mulleri found that adult shrimps infected with the creature were more likely to eat their young than uninfected adults were. The shrimp were already known to be occasional cannibals, but the presence of parasites significantly increased the chances of this happening. the parasites invade hosts in their millions The parasite in question is incredibly small (about the size of a human red blood cell) and moves into the shrimp's muscles like a spore. These parasites don't make much of a difference in small numbers, but eventually millions can flood into the host. At this point, the shrimp's muscles become damaged and the animal is forced to eat more food to meet the extra energy demands of its tiny freeloaders. ""The parasite is quite debilitating. It takes over huge areas of the muscle, so instead of a nice transparent shrimp you get quite a chalky appearance because of muscles packed with the parasite,"" said Alison Dunn, a senior author on the paper, in a press release. Dunn told Discovery News that turning to cannibalism helps the shrimp ""deal with the cost of the infection as it gains more food."" She added that earlier studies had found that the muscle damage caused by the parasites could stop the shrimps from catching their normal prey. ""So perhaps cannibalism of smaller shrimp is the only way these sick animals can survive,"" she said. cannibalism can act as a lifeboat mechanism The teams of scientists from the UK and South Africa noted that cannibalism has been recorded in more than 3,000 species (including humans) and that it is often thought to act as a ""lifeboat mechanism,"" giving organisms easy access to food in situations of dire need. Cannibalism also has the benefit of reducing competition and providing a bonus to an individual's growth and survival. Parasitism is similarly widespread, and scientists have already found numerous examples of parasites changing their hosts' behavior to suit their needs. Phys.org cites the examples of a tapeworm that makes fish swim faster or slower depending on whether it wants them to be eaten, and a parasitic wasp that half-paralyzes ladybugs to stand guard over its larvae. It's conceivable, said the scientists examining the infected shrimp, that inducing cannibalism is just another strategy parasites are using to survive. ""Our research does not suggest any link between parasites and human cannibalism,"" said Dunn. ""Cannibalism for the shrimp, unlike in humans, is a significant source of food even in uninfected animals. It seems unlikely that a parasite would be under evolutionary pressure to influence cannibalism in humans.""",0.48195002289644945,0.5180499771035505,0.7888534375955398,458,5.2030567685589517,280,6.1607142857142856,0,0,Science

That's the claim made by a new article in The New York Times by Nick Bilton, originally titled ""Could wearable computers be as harmful as cigarettes?"" Editors have already changed the headline to the more anodyne ""The health concerns in wearable tech"" in the face of substantial criticism, but the problems with the piece go much deeper than a bad headline. Bilton tackles an interesting and important question: could smartwatches be raising your risk of cancer? There are decades of research that could speak to the question, since all the relevant radiation is also emitted by cell phones. Unfortunately, Bilton ignores almost all of it, kicking the piece off by comparing the new Apple Watch to smoking cigarettes. Once upon a time, we didn't know they were bad! Perhaps there are other things we don't know... It's astounding that Mercola is being quoted as a health expert by The New York Times What follows is a spectacularly ungenerous reading of the scientific literature. Bilton quotes a single qualified physician before moving on to an osteopathic physician named Dr. Joseph Mercola who ""focuses on alternative medicine."" Mercola has been outspoken on the link between cell phones and cancer, occasionally as a guest on the Dr. Oz show, and has a lucrative side business selling homeopathic products on his website, Mercola.com. He has been the subject of four separate letters from the FDA for mislabeling products or promising health benefits that are not supported by the medical literature. The fact that he's being quoted as a health expert by The New York Times is astounding, as some have already noted. But what about the actual science? Bilton's strongest evidence comes from the International Agency for Research on Cancer, which announced in 2011 that it considered cell phones as ""possibly carcinogenic to humans."" Bilton introduces the IARC announcement as ""the most definitive and arguably unbiased results in this area."" This is somewhat misleading! To start with, it's not really a scientific result — the IARC just surveyed the available literature and decided it didn't rule out the possibility of carcinogenic effects. It's the closest anyone's come to claiming a link between cancer and cell phone exposure, but it's far from indisputable, a fact the authors freely admit. A footnote to the announcement (which Bilton omits) explains that the ruling is based on limited evidence and that ""chance, bias, or confounding could not be ruled out with reasonable confidence."" It also has its share of detractors. Even with those caveats, the announcement still met with a scathing response published in The Journal of the National Cancer Institute, pointing out acknowledged weaknesses in the IARC's sources.  ""Chance, bias, or confounding could not be ruled out with reasonable confidence."" That's not the last word on the topic, by any means. There's never a last word in science! But alongside the IARC finding, there are lots of studies that find no correlation whatsoever. Bilton doesn't like the most comprehensive study because of its telecom links, but it's easy to rattle off a bunch more. Here's one. Here's another. Here's a third. None of them found any link between cell phone use and cancer. People have been fear-mongering over cell phone radiation for decades, and scientists have been studying it for just as long. Sometimes an association does pop up, but scientists argue over what exactly it means. Each study is happy to acknowledge its limits, and none of them pretends to be the final word on the issue, but then that's how science works. ""To date, there is no evidence from studies of cells, animals, or humans that radiofrequency energy can cause cancer."" So what does the consensus say? The National Cancer Institute is skeptical: ""To date, there is no evidence from studies of cells, animals, or humans that radiofrequency energy can cause cancer."" The Institute has an even-handed rundown of the current research, and it's hard to come away from it thinking there's any real evidence for cancer risk. The World Health Organization also has a good summary, which mentions the IARC result, but contains the following crucial phrase: ""to date, no adverse health effects have been established as being caused by mobile phone use."" But...it's possible, right? Sure! A cancer link is theoretically plausible, and lots of people use cell phones, so it's the kind of thing scientists will keep looking at very, very closely. They haven't found anything solid yet, but you never know. It's an in-joke in the science world that nearly every study ends with ""more research required"" — they're all written by researchers, after all — but in this case, it seems to be the only part of the study Bilton read.

They will be taking shots of Kammerer Ranch’s blue oaks, a species of California tree particularly threatened by climate change. Though blue oaks are hardy — they can offset the stress of a drought by tapping groundwater resources once they’re past seedlings — even they have limits. Computer modeling has suggested that there will be climate stress here, Klausmeyer says. That’s why the Nature Conservancy is using the Trekker now — to get a baseline picture of how the oaks are doing. In fact, things are already changing. In four sites studied by naturalists — one of which was the Kammerer Ranch — there were three times more dead oaks in the drier, hotter areas than at the cooler temperatures found at higher elevations. And seedlings found in the study, published in Ecopshere in July 2014, were located closer to streams than adults, suggesting the new trees were growing in increasingly restricted environments. The Trekker’s 360-degree view should help scientists track how the blue oak populations change over the coming years, Klausmeyer explains. Because the trees are, well, trees, and thus stationary, they can’t simply leave the area as it becomes hotter and drier — and invasive species may out-compete them. only two-thirds of california's oak woodlands remain That’s a problem because blue oaks protect soil from erosion and landslides. Oak woodlands provide homes for 330 species — birds, mammals, reptiles, and amphibians — in California. Acorns, for instance, are abundant food for many animals. Only two-thirds of California’s oak woodlands remain, most of them under private management. Google will host the images and maintain an archive. The Nature Conservancy plans to use the Trekker for photos of Kammerer Ranch every five years for the indefinite future. And the project probably won’t just benefit blue oak conservation — since everything along the route will be shot by the cameras, other species may benefit from the monitoring as well. We set out. Inlander and I walk well behind Klausmeyer for a brief trip around a pond, where we startle a garter snake and some squirrels. It’s something of a trial run; the longer collection hike is on a loop of ranch roads across the crest of hilltops. For the longer hike, Klausmeyer is solo; Inlander and I walk the opposite direction on the loop so we won’t be in all the photos. Shortly after we set off, Inlander points at a dead oak. It died recently, he says — you can tell because it hasn’t been turned over yet. The view from one crest is pure Silicon Valley: San José spreads out below. But as we keep walking, we come along a canyon, and it’s easy to forget how close we are to the city — all that’s in sight are some oaks, grass, a few deer, and Mt. Hamilton towering above. In the distance, some deer hear Inlander’s and my voices and scatter. At the end of the second loop, Klausmeyer has acquired 2,289 panoramic images. This isn’t the only technology conservationists are using to try to preserve native species — at the nearby Blue Oak Ranch Reserve, scientists from the University of California-Berkeley monitor a network of sensors and satellites to see the effects of warming, pollution, and the growing urban area nearby. The Nature Conservancy uses drones to monitor sandhill cranes at California’s Staten Island. There’s a reason conservationists are reaching for a high tech arsenal: climate change is a serious threat. In the case of the blue oaks, a 2005 paper predicted their habitat would shrink to half of what it is now by 2099. The species will shift north, and only a third of current conservation areas cover the areas that can provide blue oaks with suitable habitats for the hotter, drier future, the authors write. To say nothing of the hotter, drier present. We talk, as Californians do, about rain, while Klausmeyer packs up the Trekker. I suspect we are done for the season, I tell them. Inlander hopes we are not. It’s a fairly routine conversation — a kind of Californian ritual, discussing rain and its absence. But I think of it again, later, when I read that last January was the driest in California since anyone began keeping track, in an editorial written by Jay Famiglietti, a senior water scientist at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The data collected by the Nature Conservancy isn't quite a baseline —  the conservationists I was out with would have to time-travel for that.  The climate is already changing, and the changes are already serious. Only about a year of water remains in reserve in California, and groundwater is being rapidly pumped to supply the farmers in the Central Valley. ""In some areas of the Central Valley, the land is sinking by one foot or more per year"" because of the pumping, Famiglietti writes. It's not clear if the current drought is caused by climate change, but climate change is almost certainly making it worse. The lack of rain appears to be part of an atmospheric cycle, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Though, of course, the agency suggests that human-caused global warming may play a role. NOAA's finding is complicated by a more recent paper, published this year in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, that suggests warm and dry years create drought; cool, dry years don't. The current drought is occurring in one of the longest periods of combined severe heat and a dearth of water in the last 120 years, the PNAS paper says. The drought is just one beautiful day after another. It's summery at Kammerer Ranch, even though it's only March. It's not until later that I realize how ominous all that sunshine is.

The 2016 model improves on its predecessor: its electric battery is both lighter and larger than last year's model, increasing in capacity from 17.1 kWh to 18.4 kWh.  But it's the new Volt's range that is most impressive — the hybrid car can travel 50 miles running on electric power alone. That means the new car can go some 12 miles further on its battery than last year's model, and the company says it expects drivers to be able to travel more than 1,000 miles on average before filling up their gas tanks. Chevrolet says the new Volt uses revised battery tech that makes the car's electric propulsion system 21 pounds lighter. The car's two-motor drive unit is lighter too, cutting 100 pounds from the weight of the 2015 unit. The decrease in weight and increase in engine efficiency means the car's two engines can combine to make it more agile than before — the manufacturer says the 2016 Volt has 19 percent stronger zero-to-30 mph acceleration. The company says the Volt's shape is inspired by ""the toned physiques of athletes."" The Volt still looks more like a five-door sedan than your average four-limbed human sportsperson, but the new model does have some nice aesthetic touches, including a battery charge indicator projected onto the windscreen, and an illuminated charging socket so drivers will be able to plug in their cars in the dark.

That means if you want to enjoy something of your own on that new aftermarket audio system your friend won't shut up about, you'll have to wait. Harman wants to help change that by building what it calls Individual Sound Zone (ISZ) technology into cars, letting you listen to what you want without hearing what's playing in everyone else's speakers.    We got a demonstration of the new tech at Harman's booth in Las Vegas' Hard Rock Hotel this week, and we can say that it works even if it's still imperfect. Using an array of speakers that fire directly at the driver and each passenger, ISZ lets the individual choose what he or she wants to listen to on the fly while also blocking out what everyone else is listening to. That's all handled using a touch interface that lets you select what kind of media you want to play and where it's playing. (The displays weren't yet ready to test during our demo.) It may not be possible to drown out all other audio completely, but Harman is working on it. In the small Lexus concept model we piled into, we could still pick up the audio other passengers were listening to without much straining. Harman says that the effect improves in larger cars. Harman says that all carmakers can implement the new tech, so we may see it on the road in the next model year.

Massachusetts-based company PillPack wants to change that by redesigning the typical pharmacy experience. Currently serving 31 states, the company recently raised $4 million in funding to expand its services which ship two weeks worth of medications to patients in individual day packs that can be torn off and taken anywhere.  The idea is to try to take the hassle out of a few major parts of the pharmacy experience. PillPack coordinates prescriptions, refills, and claims to guarantee shipping of all medications on time, every time. Patients pay a $20 fee in addition to prescription co-pays for a box to arrive at their doorsteps containing all of a their medications for two weeks, measured out into day packs that can be ripped off from a roll one at a time. Each individual pack is labeled with the date, time, and list of pills inside. A medication list that explains what each pill is and how it should be taken is also included in the box, along with a recyclable dispenser and any other medications that cannot be placed into the pack, like liquids and inhalants.   The design language wants to change the idea of what a pharmacy is and could be But PillPack's ambitions go beyond perforated medicine packets. The design of the system, while channelling minimalist design, is also attempting to rethink the entire pharmacy experience. Atlas Venture partner Fred Destin told The Wall Street Journal that he thinks the company could become ""the most recognized name in pharmacy with a brand and reputation that matches that of Apple."" That's a bold statement, but — like Apple — it's clear that product design plays a big role in what PillPack's trying to do. Medical nonadherence goes far beyond people forgetting to take pills — according to the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists, some chronically ill patients think that they don't need the medication prescribed to them, so they opt not to take it. Other patients feel their pride take a hit when a doctor prescribes a pill regimen for the rest of their lives, leading to them receive medication and then simply not use it.  PillPack currently addresses some accessibility, portability, and privacy issues surrounding medicine, but in order for the company to really change the way pharmacies work, it needs to be licensed in all 50 states and bring this system everywhere. It also needs to focus on how patients interact with the system, specifically in mobile apps and reminders. Other companies are based on this idea alone: Medisafe Project makes a mobile app that reminds patients when to take their medication, and AdhereTech makes a smart pill bottle that knows when a patient took, or missed, a dosage of medication. PillPack has a mobile interface that informs patients about changes in prescriptions and shipping, but it doesn't seem to remind patients when to take their pills yet. It's got a long way to go, but PillPack could be a solution that keeps patients with long-term medicine needs healthy, while also providing solace in a personalized packet.",0.3689937961402209,0.6310062038597791,0.87144433904054,554,4.9223826714801442,307,5.9446254071661242,0,0,"Business, Design"

Previous winners have included Shepard Fairey's Barack Obama ""Progress"" poster, the London 2012 Olympic Torch, and the One Laptop Per Child designed by Yves Behar — while a discontinued Designer of the Year prize was handed to Jony Ive way back in 2003. In among mentions of familiar brands and architects like Nest, Toyota, and Zaha Hadid, the 2014 selection includes obscure but worthy projects like Nigeria's floating school and Japan's Child Chemo House. The prevalence of Kickstarter projects is also notable, with Oculus Rift, the Bradley Timepiece, and Chineasy all being helped by successful campaigns on the crowdfunding hub. Here you'll find a selection of the 76 nominations, all of which will be on show at the Design Museum from the end of March through August. A panel of as yet unannounced judges is in charge of picking seven category winners in the spring who will then compete for the overall prize in the summer. Patrons of the museum and people online won't be neglected, either, with a visitor vote determining the public's overall favorite and an online social vote pitting individual designs in a head-to-head popularity contest.  More of an ethos than a full-fledged design, Dave Hakkens’ Phonebloks project urges smartphone manufacturers to unite around a single modular hardware platform. Instead of replacing millions of handsets every year because of one malfunctioning or obviated part, the Phonebloks idea is to simply replace the bad module and keep the device going. Google’s Project Ara team is now working on developing the specification for this platform, which could one day revolutionize the way we buy and upgrade our phones. This three-story floating structure takes ""an innovative, cheap, and sustainable approach"" to providing for the social needs of the Makoko community in Nigeria. It's designed by local architect Kunle Adeyemi, who makes pragmatic use of available materials and offers a prototype for future new buildings in the flood-blighted area. Coming from the same twisted mind as the DRM chair (which self-destructs after it's been used a predetermined number of times), Grand-Central is a mechanical device that prints out any messages you send with a set of computer-controlled marker pens. Designer Thibault Brevet describes it as ""a tangible output device"" for network-connected people. Featuring a centrefold illustration of Dita Von Teese by David Downton, this compendium presents an exploration of modern trends in drawing and design. Jones draws on contributions from a wide variety of sources, including tattooists and manicurists as well as artists and curators. Recyclable, robust, and customizable. Toyota's Me.We concept car sets itself the sort of goals you'd expect from a portable device and uses similar materials too. This all-electric transporter is built around a tubular aluminum structure with interchangeable polypropylene body panels. It also aims for ultimate versatility by adapting to use as a pickup, a convertible, an off-roader, or a small city car. Designer Jean-Marie Massaud says that ""the car has become an accumulation of constraints more than a source of freedom,"" and the Me.We is a response to the need for ""more adaptability, simplicity and lightness."" Making the Chinese language more approachable to a Western audience, ShaoLan Hsueh’s Chineasy melds text and illustration into one. The idea is that you’re more likely to learn the meaning of a character when you have a visual metaphor for it imprinted in your mind. A gift from the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs, this redesign is highlighted by the wheeled UN Lounge Chair and the privacy-conscious Sphere Table. Both have an air of retro-futurism about them, which is complemented by a color scheme evocative of the middle of the past century. It's not a watch, say the designers behind this timepiece, because you don't have to ""watch"" it to tell the time. The Bradley uses a simple ball-bearing system to give a tactile representation of time, making it suitable for people with limited sight. Its name is inspired by Bradley Snyder, an ex-Naval officer who lost his eyesight in Afghanistan in 2011, but went on to win Paralympic swimming medals in London a year later. Led by Hyungsoo Kim, the Eone team completed a successful Kickstarter campaign for the Bradley and is currently taking pre-orders on its website. Cast iron isn't the first material you'd think of when designing the storefront for a luxury clothing brand, but 6a Architects chose it for the way it invokes the local street ornaments like railings and lampposts. That's then mixed with a ""sinuous pattern of interlocking circles"" and protruding shop windows to simultaneously echo nearby architecture and stand out from it with its unorthodoxy. Environmentally conscious design is a big theme of this year's awards and these reusable bottle caps fit right into it. Instead of being disposed of with the plastic water container, Clever Caps can be repurposed as building blocks, having been designed to be compatible with a certain unnamed company's popular toy block system. Cutesy visuals and upbeat music are juxtaposed with a serious message in this digital campaign to remind people to be vigilant when near trains. There are exploding heads, floating eyeballs, genitalia-assaulting piranhas, and a set of mini games in accompanying iOS and Android apps. Named for Azerbaijan's longtime leader, the Heydar Aliyev Center is part of a big redevelopment of Baku that also includes the Baku Crystal Hall, which hosted the 2012 Eurovision Song Contest.

And that's generally true for a wide range of professions and hobbies: photographers, video editors, even gamers. ""They all do very specific jobs on the computer, but the main way they interact with the software is through the generic, one-size-fits-all keyboard,"" explains Palette co-founder Calvin Chu. ""I think there's a lot of a value in having something that's customizable, rearrangeable to make a tool that fits the way you work."" So he and partner Ashish Bidadi set out to create a solution — a modular, ""freeform"" control system that snaps together like pieces of Lego.  ""This is a cooler way of playing a game than with arrow keys and a spacebar."" The controller, which is available to preorder now, is essentially a series of modules that you can connect together in different ways. There are buttons, dials, and sliders, and they can all snap together to create a completely customized control system. Each module can then be mapped to a specific function: during a hands-on demo with a near-final prototype I was able to zoom in and out in Photoshop by moving a slider up and down, and adjust the tempo of a song in Traktor by twisting a dial. Perhaps the best demonstration came in the form of the space sim Kerbal Space Program — you could use a dial to increase the throttle, and then smack a big round button to launch your ship. It felt surprisingly good, and much more engaging than just tapping away at a keyboard. ""This is a cooler way of playing a game than with arrow keys and a spacebar,"" says Chu.   Because the modules can be swapped around in a variety of configurations, you can customize them in a way that feels most comfortable. I set Palette up in an L shape, for example, so it fit snuggly with a laptop. But it wasn't always so flexible. In its early days, when it was still just a design project from a couple of students from the University of Waterloo, it resembled something like a tray covered with plugs. Instead of plugging into each other, the modules would snap into the tray. It was a similar idea to the Palette I tried, but much more rigid. ""We didn't want to restrict people to a four-by-four grid,"" explains Chu. Palette raised more than $150,000 in funding through Kickstarter earlier this year, and the team is preparing to kick off production in the next few months. Whether it's Pebble or Ouya, crowdfunded hardware projects have run into problems when it comes to actually launching on time, but Palette is hoping to avoid some of those production pitfalls with a little preparation. Last year the project was accepted into a hardware accelerator program called HAXLR8R, and that summer Chu and Bidadi spent a few weeks in Shenzhen, China, meeting vendors and learning a bit more about the process. ""That was a pretty crazy adventure,"" says Chu. They've already made a few changes based on the experience, including switching over to a different kind of button that was more readily available.  ""We didn't expect gaming to be so popular."" Aside from money, the Kickstarter campaign also helped the small company realize just how  how many use cases there were for the fledgling controller. ""We didn't expect gaming to be so popular,"" explains Chu. A surprising number of backers were excited about the idea of using the buttons and dials for flight-simulator games, while others thought a customized setup could give them an advantage in Starcraft matches. Even some physicists reached out, inquiring about the idea of using Palette to control sensitive lab equipment. ""That was kind of the most exciting part of the Kickstarter,"" Chu says, ""just hearing all of these different, sometimes crazy applications of how people might want to use this."" The team is also considering adding new modules in the future, like trackballs and joysticks. But for now the focus is on finalizing the software and making sure the production goes smoothly for the more than 900 Kickstarter backers, as well as those who have since preordered a kit. (Palette comes in a few different configurations, ranging from a $99 starter kit to a $599 set for pros.) Units for non-backers are expected to ship this fall. With its plug-and-play nature, Palette is intuitive enough that it could be a useful tool for a wide range of people, from wedding photographers to budding DJs. But, at least initially, the team is building with power users in mind. ""We think that the pros are going to like it the most,"" says Chu.",0.6438055770611083,0.3561944229388917,0.19362833043298133,791,4.7585335018963342,422,6.0710900473933647,0,0,"Design, Tech, Report"

On New Year’s Day 2013, he made a book of his findings. At any given moment in the previous year, he discovered, there was a 43 percent chance that he was alone. He was productive 49.3 percent of the time, and was most productive on Wednesdays, when he was 57.8 percent productive. He spent 32 percent of 2012 sleeping. Felton had effectively turned himself into a series of charts, graphs, and spreadsheets. He could cross reference his mood with his productivity, or he could simply measure the amount of time he spent with his girlfriend Olga. Since 2005, Felton has been living the quantified self dream: a life where everything’s measured. Most recently, he began documenting his life several times per day with a custom mobile app. Today, he’s bringing his app to the masses so anyone can measure life the way he has, for $3.99. It’s called Reporter. Reporter for iPhone screenshotsPreviousNextView full GalleryPreviousNext Reporter works by buzzing you several times per day with a brief quiz based on the questions Felton asks himself. They range from ""Where are you?"" to ""What are you doing?"" and ""Who are you with?"" Some questions can be answered by tapping Yes or No, while others are multiple choice questions, let you type in text, or offer a location picker that polls Foursquare for nearby places. You can also add your own questions (like ""Are you happy?"") or program certain questions to occur only when you hit the app’s Awake or Sleep switch (like ""How did you sleep?"" and ""What did you learn today?""). Each time you report, the app also pulls in various pieces of information like the current weather, how many steps you’ve taken today (using the iPhone 5s’ M7 motion coprocessor), and how noisy it is around you using your phone’s mic. 'Reporting' is like journaling — a practice that provides the most real value in hindsight The act of ""reporting"" (in Felton’s terminology) is kind of like journaling — a practice that’s therapeutic, but provides the most real value in hindsight and in aggregate, as Felton learned. Reporter displays a few pocket-sized infographics to help you reflect on your answers, but the real sum of all this information is far from accessible until you export it. The app stores all your data locally, but lets you output it as a CSV or JSON file — at which point you can map it out any way you’d like. Felton realizes that not everyone has statistics expertise, so he hopes to add a feature that lets users print their own books in the future like he does, and expects members of the Reporter community to create web tools to visualize data in unique ways.  It should be pretty simple, Felton says, to see which month of the year you were happiest, or compare productivity levels between two jobs you’ve held. But for Felton and developer Drew Breunig, the best lessons aren’t always learned from charts and graphs. ""Some of the most interesting things I learn are not from visualizations but from the app’s autosuggest,"" Breunig says. ""I typed in M (in response to ‘Who are you with?’) and got my co-worker Mary instead of my wife Megan. It was a scary point when I thought I’d been working too much and should spend more time at home."" ""Fitbit is missing when you got married or bought a car."" Felton still has a Narrative lifelogging camera clipped to his lapel and a Fitbit in his pocket, but he feels like these gadgets only tell part of the story. ""Fitbit is missing when you got married or bought a car,"" he says. ""That context is missing and these events have such a huge impact on your activity."" In building Reporter, Felton and Breunig hoped to add a customizable human input to lifelogging. The app’s workflow has been manicured so thoughtfully that it takes just moments to report. Logging events and activity has long been a preoccupation for Felton, who got his first chance to bring his ideas to life at scale while at Facebook.  Felton led design on Timeline, the company’s life-spanning profile pages, and Open Graph. He wanted to let anybody share their ""life events"" like graduating from college, but also the minutiae of daily life, like the song you’re listening to on Spotify right this second. Timeline launched to much fanfare, and Felton was named one of Fast Company’s 50 most influential designers in America. But Facebook soon learned that it made a fatal assumption: people don’t always want to document their lives as a historian might — publicly, at least. Meanwhile, Felton checked his personal data charts and noticed that he had been spending more time ""in meetings"" and ""in email"" than ""designing"" — an activity that had previously dominated his life. He left Facebook and began working on a pure utility that let you document your life privately and locally (unless you want to sync with Dropbox). ""We don’t own your data, but we try to show it to you in new ways"" To its creators, Reporter is about gaining self-knowledge. ""We don’t own your data, but we try to show it to you in new ways and help you be aware of what you’re emitting,"" says Felton. ""I want you to be scared by your routine, or by decisions you haven’t thought about because you don’t want to face them,"" says Breunig. But is it worth spending 79 hours a year measuring yourself by hand? ""My reports are driven mainly by curiosity,"" Felton says. ""I have questions that tech can’t answer for me yet, like how does my behavior change based on who I’m with? It’s cool to explore the foreground of what will be possible."" After a year of reporting every 76 minutes, Felton seems a bit tired. In world that’s increasingly averse to plugging in in front of your friends and family, reporting could be exhausting and antisocial. So for 2014, Felton won’t be focused on manual data-entry, he says. 2014’s Annual Report will cover all the data he gathers using a combination of the Basis fitness tracker, FuelBand, Fitbit, Moves for iPhone, Narrative, Lapka blood alcohol monitor, and other fitness gadgets. In 10 years, Felton says, all this data collection will be happening constantly and automatically. The idea sounds scary, at first, but Felton won’t mind a bit. By measuring ourselves privately and intelligently, we can potentially gain incredible insights into the choices we’ve made, and the choices we have yet to make. It’s not yet clear what kind of discoveries personal measurement will yield, but they’ll span the entirety of our lives from our health to our productivity. Reporter doesn’t quite fulfill the ultimate dream of the quantified self, but if you’re an obsessive tracker, or simply hoping to learn a bit more about your daily routine, it might help chart your path to reaching it.",0.7331349686647886,0.26686503133521144,0.8476400754520932,1178,4.8531409168081492,607,6.1153212520593083,0,0,"Apps, Design, Tech, Hands-on, Report"

He holed up in his bedroom, shut the door, and opened his laptop. Over the summer his father had opened an Etrade account for him, using around $10,000 Bruggemann had saved up over two years working as a busboy and waiter at a local BBQ joint. At first Bruggemann had used that cash to buy some big, well-known stocks: Apple, Verizon, and a few others. But today was different. One by one he liquidated those positions and put almost everything he had into American Community Development Group Inc, ticker sign ACYD, a penny stock selling for $.003 a share.  Over the next year Bruggemann would turn that $10,000 into more than $300,000, principally trading penny stocks, a practice rife with risk, fraud, and wild swings of fortune. He took off school that day, but for most of the time when Bruggemann was trading, he was also a 16-year-old high school junior in Wyckoff, New Jersey. With his iPhone in hand, Bruggemann would buy and sell six figures of stock from his lunch table, the bathroom, and, occasionally, on the sly while sitting at his desk.  What Bruggemann did with penny stocks isn’t new, but technology has changed what’s possible. Twenty years ago even the best home internet wouldn’t have supported this kind of real-time trading. A decade ago you might have done it from a home office. Today, with the supercomputers we carry in our pockets, a kid can put his life savings on the line while sitting in Spanish class.           He got a job as a busboy at a local restaurant at 14 and worked weekends. He put his money into a savings account, but was unhappy with the paltry interest he earned. His grandfather encouraged him to try the stock market and his father, a former Wall Street trader, eventually agreed to act as the custodian for an Etrade account. ""I always talk about the glory days, so maybe it rubbed off a little,"" said his father John, a former vice president at JP Morgan who worked on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. But John never played the penny stocks. ""Never. Not my game. You could make money or lose money very, very quickly.""     ACYD was Bruggemann’s first big trade. It’s a manufacturer of industrial grade wireless equipment for municipal Wi-Fi systems. He had listened to a conference call where the CEO announced it would buy back shares of the company to try and spur the price towards 1 cent a share. Four days later, Bruggemann accumulated a position of several million shares at the price of roughly one-third of a penny each. Four days after that, the company officially announced its share buyback program, and the price began to climb.       By March, ACYD was down to a penny, and today it sits at $.0036 a share, almost exactly where it was when Bruggemann got started. It’s a reminder to him that trading such volatile stocks is a dangerous game. ""I guess the rule of thumb  is, when you invest in a penny stock, expect to lose every dollar you put in. So there is always that risk,"" he told me. ""There have been several times where I put every dollar I’ve had on the line, and fortunately it's worked out almost every time."" He stops, then corrects himself. ""Every time! Or else I’d have nothing."" The Verge reviewed Bruggemann's trading records and bank statements for this piece. About half of his more than $300,000 came from his ACYD trade. The other half came from hundreds of trades that netted him much smaller amounts. Despite his strong returns, experts insist, do not mean he’s got some secret formula for success. ""Smartphones have exacerbated the monkeys and typewriters problem,"" says Paul Kedrosky, a veteran investor. ""Given enough people with smartphones, a teen from New Jersey will turn his bar mitzvah money into $300,000, purely by chance."" Bruggemann’s personal success appears to be equal parts luck and hard work; a combination of diligent research, tolerance for risk, and the discipline to get out quickly to limit his losses. It’s worth noting that he’s only been trading for about 17 months. And it helped, of course, those months took place during the last year and half, while the stock market was climbing to new highs. Like gambling at a casino, the odds when playing penny stocks are stacked against you. The high levels of fraud and volatility mean it's very difficult to anticipate what's coming. Connor's staggering success, say seasoned traders, is not a magic method others could replicate. In fact, many I talked to doubted it was real at all. ""There are NO prodigies, just bull markets,"" says Howard Lindzon, an investor and founder of Stocktwits. He encouraged me not to cover Bruggemann’s story. Other traders I talked to were much harsher. ""It's bullshit. Trust me,"" said one. ""This is being orchestrated by a penny stock alerts product; it's a marketing scam.""   At home, in a room he shares with his older brother, Bruggemann has two monitors set up as a trading station. But most of the time, he tells me, ""I prefer to trade on my phone."" He monitors trades using a service called Level2, which shows him who the buyer and sellers are, what prices they’re asking for, and how many shares they hold. He also consults the chat room, which he runs, and various message boards he either operates or frequents. Finally he has the Etrade app, where he actually executes all his buy and sell orders. ""In school they have a lot of things blocked, Java is blocked, so I use my iPhone instead."" Bruggemann has had his phone confiscated a few times, leading the school to contact his parents. ""Last year I got a call from the school saying the physics teacher took away Connor’s cell phone and now I have to come and pick it up,"" said his mother. Bruggemann bought himself a new BMW with his earnings, a new Macbook for each of his parents on their birthdays, and iPads for his siblings.  ""I asked what time did this happen, and she said 9:35. I said you probably just cost him money. He trades stocks, 9:35 means the market just opened, he had to make a move. They told me he’s in physics class, he can’t do that, and I’m like, ok, whatever."" Bruggemann has applied to college and hopes to study finance, economics, and entrepreneurship. But he has also cooked up his own advice website, where users can learn his trading tips and tricks, follow along with his plays, and converse in a private chat room with Bruggemann and a few other traders, all the for the low price of just $2,000 a year. This is probably where his interaction with penny stocks borders most on the unscrupulous side. Bruggemann is a big fan of Tim Sykes, a former whiz-kid himself, who promises to make his customers rich in just seven days. The site Bruggeman is running doesn’t make any outlandish claims, but he’s still peddling the idea that he has a special skillset others can use to their benefit trading penny stocks, a promise that might be hard to keep. While the promises on Bruggeman’s website are far less aggressive than ""Get rich quick"" schemes like Sykes', there is an element of self-interest in creating a watch list of penny stocks. ""If someone is going to pay me for what I’m trading, I don’t want to get in at a penny and they get in at a penny and a half."" Recommending stocks you already own without disclosing that fact is at the heart of many penny stock schemes. It’s worth emphasizing here that, while The Verge could find no evidence of Bruggeman pushing penny stocks to his followers in an attempt to pump and dump shares, the basic nature of his website is fraught with that potential. Bruggeman says he is careful to indicate which stocks he is in and alerts followers when he enters and exits a stock. For now, the community following his watch list of stocks is fairly small. ""We have 16 people it’s emailed out to daily. My Twitter is a little over 1,000. They don’t subscribe to me, but if I tweet, sometimes they will follow my plays.""     Along with setting aside savings, John insisted Connor apply to college. He also helped Bruggemann set up his investment advice website, and was careful to keep him from promising too much. ""He looks at the Tim Sykes character as his model and believes that he has insight to give. He explains his process, some stuff he’s looking at, but I never want him to give the appearance that he’s promoting a stock. Hey everybody go out and buy X, Y, and Z because I’m promoting the stock. No. Please don’t become that.""       Bruggemann turns 18 soon, and he often teases his father that he'll be heading to the dealership the day he's old enough to do what he pleases with his cash. But he maintains no illusions about the world he’s playing in. ""The company I’m in right now, the CEO got arrested for embezzling funds. He stole $185,000 from the Girl Scouts, before this."" What he likes about this world is that he is competing against people like himself, mostly small-timers he feels he can beat. ""[In] penny stocks, you’re playing against high schoolers. You’re playing Division III."" He says that he’s tried some of the more well-known stock exchanges, but felt that high-frequency traders using sophisticated algorithms were eating into his profits. He keeps a copy of Michael Lewis' new book, Flash Boys, on his dresser as a reminder that in their own ways, all markets have their unscrupulous players. Penny stocks are a risky game, he acknowledges, but ""there is way more cheating on Wall Street.""",0.6292109112263327,0.37078908877366734,0.8667552848908778,1717,4.5987186953989516,824,5.8871359223300974,0,20,"Business, Tech, Report"

Caviar is like Seamless, in that it connects customers and restaurants for easy ordering. It builds on that model in a way Seamless has not by constructing its own delivery network, adding that option for restaurants that don't want to create and manage their own couriers. Today Caviar, which was previously web only, is announcing the launch of its first mobile app, as well as expansion into new areas like Brooklyn, San Jose, Cupertino, and Sunnyvale. As we've reported in the past, Square has two distinct sides of its business. It offers tools to merchants by managing their finances and inventory, helping them process payments, and tracking customer trends. That has become a massive business, reportedly handling $30 billion in transactions annually. The problem is that Square only keeps $300 million of that in revenue, meaning the company is not yet profitable. The goal was always to leverage the success among merchants to build services that the average consumer would use, a business that typically has much better margins. But so far Square hasn't had the same kind of success with the consumer side of the business, killing its wallet app back in May and replacing it with an app for ordering food. With its purchase of Caviar, Square doubled down on ordering food as its best bet for finding consumer traction. A recent report from Nicholas Carlson indicated that there were competing factions within Square, with one side pulling to focus on the more boring but already established enterprise business. CEO Jack Dorsey, on the other hand, is reportedly heading the faction that is still gunning to create a consumer facing brand. The ultimate direction Square takes may rest in large part on whether or not Caviar, it's biggest acquisition, finds mainstream success. In some ways Caviar's business model resembles Uber. They go into a new city and train a bunch of contract workers, in their case, couriers to deliver food, not drivers to pick up passengers. The wrinkle is that unlike Uber, Caviar has a third side to the transaction. ""We started out with one city two years ago. Last year we expanded to three. This year we'll be in 15,"" says Jason Wang, one of Caviar's founders. ""Getting a three-sided marketplace - customers, restaurants, and couriers - is tricky.

There were no big suprises, with the top slots going to artists like Ed Sheeran, Eminem, Katy Perry, Ariana Grande, and Pharrell topping the streaming charts. The glaring absence of course, was Taylor Swift, who has been openly feuding with Spotify and recently pulled her music from the service entirely. We reached out to Spotify to ask if Swift had been axed from the list due to the fact that her music was no longer available. ""The top lists are an accurate reflection of what was listened to this year, there was absolutely no meddling or removing of her from the list,"" a spokesperson replied by email. ""Taylor simply didn't make it into the top five."" That is a little hard to believe, given how popular Swift is right now. In a blog post responding to Swift's decision to remove her music from the service, Spotify wrote that ""We love Taylor Swift, and our more than 40 million users love her even more – nearly 16 million of them have played her songs in the last 30 days, and she’s on over 19 million playlists."" On the other hand, Swift hasn't released a new album to Spotify since Red in 2012. Her newest album, 1989, was never available on Spotify. The top five female artists all released albums in 2013 and 2014, so it's possible that Swift missed the cut because didn't have any recent hits on Spotify helping to drive her overall plays. The most exciting track on the list for my money has to be Blue Suede's ""Hooked on a Feeling"", which won for Top Throwback. The track was part of the best-selling oldies collection that made up the soundtrack for Guardians of the Galaxy.

UberPool, which launches there early next week, offers a way to share a ride with someone else who ordered an UberX ride along the same route. That promises to trim costs anywhere from 20 to 50 percent, Uber says, as well as cut downtime for drivers who are waiting to pick people up.

It expanded that idea to Paris last month, with a discount in the event that a matching co-rider could not be found. The idea has attracted the attention of regulators Uber is not alone in matching up strangers who are open to carpooling, though the feature has attracted the attention of regulators that question its legality. Competitor Lyft (which Uber is in a fierce battle with), as well as Sidecar, launched nearly identical services respectively called Lyft Line and Sidecar Shared Rides in early August, with the same promise of cutting rider costs in half.

AT&T has agreed to a settlement and to making several changes to its security practices.  The stolen data was used to unlock and likely resell cellphones The commission found that a number of employees at each of the three AT&T data centers had improperly accessed customer information and then sold that information to third parties. The story sounds like a cellphone heist: in Mexico, an entity known as El Pelon provided call center workers with a list of phone numbers that it wanted them to look up. Workers would then grab information associated with the account — including customer name and the last four digits of the owner's social security number — and sell it back to El Pelon. In all locations, the stolen information was used to make unlock requests for the associated phones through AT&T's website, potentially allowing the phones to be resold. The commission believes that El Pelon is an alias, and it is not aware of the third parties involved at the other two call centers. Additional data was exposed to call center employees during the breach, including call metadata such as who a person called and for how long, but it does not appear that this information was forwarded to the third parties.

The Department of Justice, which released the news yesterday, said that this settlement would ""resolve the allegations"" in the complaint. In turn, Sprint will not admit any wrongdoing in the case. In its original complaint, the Department of Justice alleged that Sprint had falsely inflated the cost of fulfilling government surveillance orders. Phone companies are legally required to comply with court orders for specific wiretap requests. In return, they can claim reimbursement for ""reasonable expenses."" In 2006, the FCC clarified that this only meant the costs of performing a wiretap, and not the cost of making surveillance-friendly changes to a network, even if companies were required to do it. But in its complaint, the Department of Justice claimed that Sprint quietly kept adding upgrade-related costs to its bills between 2007 and 2010. The complaint says this effectively inflated its charges by 58 percent, split between the FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and other agencies. If the accusations are true, the Department of Justice is settling for far less than it could have sought in court. The complaint asks for triple the damages and extra civil penalties, as allowed by the False Claims Act. This settlement, in fact, is $5.5 million less than Sprint allegedly got by inflating the fees. At the time of the original complaint, a spokesperson said that Sprint had ""fully cooperated with this investigation,"" and would defend itself ""vigorously.""

In April 2013, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and his brother Tamerlan set off two homemade bombs near the finish line of the Boston Marathon, killing three people and injuring over 250. When investigators released images of two unknown suspects, the pair fled, shooting and killing a police officer in the process. Escaping from a firefight with police, Dzhokhar ran over and killed his brother; he was eventually found injured in a boat. Prosecutors brought 30 charges against him, 17 of which carried the possibility of capital punishment. Today, a jury found him guilty of all 30. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev found guilty of conspiracy to use a weapon of mass destruction #Breaking This wasn't an unexpected outcome. Although Tsarnaev pled not guilty, his involvement in the plot was never in doubt. Prosecutors argued that he was a full participant in the attack, calling over 90 witnesses during the trial. The defense portrayed Tsarnaev — who was 19 at the time of the attack — as a teenage victim of his brother's manipulation. The primary question, however, has never been his guilt. It's whether Tsarnaev will face capital punishment, something the jury will decide in a second stage. His attorney Judy Clarke has spent much of her career fighting the death penalty; she's successfully defended the Unabomber, mass shooter Jared Loughner, and others from execution.

The report looks at the recent denial-of-service attack against Github, which flooded the site with bad traffic for five days, resulting in intermittent downtime. China's cybersecurity administration had been suspected as the source of attacks, but the new report lays out the evidence in more damning detail, showing the redirection occurring as traffic enters China Telecom, indicating it is part of the same infrastructure as China's Great Firewall. The attack on Github worked by tampering with an analytics script that the Chinese web giant Baidu distributes. Anyone visiting a site with the script would normally send back data to Baidu and receive a reply, but the Cannon intercepted that data in transit, inserting a new script that would blast Github with bad traffic. It isn't the first time the tactic has been used, but it's the most high-profile example, and it put China's new web powers on full display. The same tactics could also be used to inject malware into any unencrypted communication with the Chinese web, including ads or analytics scripts, in a stealthier version of a network injection attack.   The report was possible in part because the attack against Github went on for days, long after Github's mitigation efforts had blunted the attack. That gave researchers a chance to run tests and assess what triggered the Great Cannon injections and what didn't. At the same time, the duration of the attack suggests China didn't care about keeping the Great Cannon secret, and may have been showing off the new weapon as a kind of deterrent. A denial-of-service attack against a popular American site is also one of the most visible ways to deploy the tool. ""I would assume China would’ve had this sort of capability,"" said ICSI's Nicholas Weaver, one of the report's lead researchers, ""but I would’ve also assumed that they wouldn’t want to broadcast this to the world."" ""I would’ve... assumed that they wouldn’t want to broadcast this to the world."" Many have already called for US retaliation for the Github attack — with one researcher describing it as ""attacks by a nation state against key United States internet infrastructure."" The NSA has similar capabilities through the QUANTUM program, revealed by Edward Snowden, but it has never used them in such an aggressive and public way. Still, the existence and nominal secrecy of those programs may make it difficult to go after the newly revealed weapon through diplomatic channels. Still, it's unclear how the rest of the web might blunt the Great Cannon's power going forward. HTTPS encryption can be used to protect against the attack, but the Chinese government strongly discourages HTTPS among Chinese companies for just this reason. As a result, the biggest blow may be to companies like Baidu as they seek to integrate with the global web. Baidu was a tempting target for the Great Cannon because its analytics script was so widely used — but now that the capabilities of the Great Cannon are public, sites may be more wary of using code that might be vulnerable to it. That would be bad news for Baidu, but also any Chinese companies looking to serve ads or other plugins to the rest of the web.",0.4672342319326629,0.5327657680673371,0.8173497584960551,560,4.9839285714285717,294,6.091836734693878,0,2,"US & World, National Security"

However, a new report from the state's Department of Economic Development found that the initiative only created 76 jobs in 2014, despite a $28 million ad campaign. Cuomo's senior economic aide told Capital New York that 76 jobs was ""a good number that we can stand behind,"" and it was only a matter of time before the other jobs materialized. The zones created by Start-Up New York were tied to 62 sponsoring colleges and universities. The program allowed companies to operate tax-free for 10 years ""on eligible campuses and spaces."" According to the report, those 76 jobs came from 30 companies in industries like software, biotech, and manufacturing. The companies were supposed to invest $91 million over five years, but only invested $1.7 million. Cuomo's administration peddled much bigger numbers in February Part of the reason the numbers are so pathetic is because pre-existing companies are only eligible if they expand into those zones. That stipulation led critics of the program to dismiss it as ""tax cronyism."" The program hasn't been around for long. But Cuomo's administration peddled much bigger numbers back in February. At the time, Cuomo's tax commissioner claimed that Start-Up New York had benefitted 73 companies, pulled in $104 million in private investment, and created 2,300 jobs, Capital New York reports. Those promotional numbers, however, were merely commitments, not a sure thing. This year an additional 26 businesses have been approved for the program, but 12 have withdrawn their applications.

Its side-scrolling 2D gameplay brings me back to when I was a kid playing Super Mario, but it's also a game that I will only play when my own kids leave the room: Tembo is equal parts fun and frustrating, and it's hard to play a few minutes without letting out a burst of expletives. The game itself plays sort of like a mash-up of Sonic the Hedgehog and Contra. As Tembo, an elephant who has been enlisted by the military to help fight off an enemy force, you primarily smash things. Tembo's main ability is a dash that bashes aside bad guys and debris, allowing you to run straight through everything from piles of cars to towering trees. You can also use it to destroy enemy tanks and helicopters, and much like in Sonic, the levels are designed to accentuate this ability: there are lots of hills and big jumps, encouraging constant movement. Tembo is at its best when you're going fast Tembo is at its best when you're going fast — when everything clicks, it's exhilarating. But it's also filled with well-designed twists that use the elephant's small range of abilities in clever ways. In addition to running, jumping, and smashing, Tembo can also squirt water from his trunk. At first you use this to put out some fires, but eventually water can help you alter the landscape. Watering certain seeds can them into platforms and bridges, useful for reaching new areas.  When you combine these puzzles with some tricky platforming and a thrilling sense of speed, you have a game that calls to mind some of the best side-scrolling classics. And just like those older games, Tembo can be very challenging, with moments that require precision, despite the fact that you're controlling a clumsy, lumbering elephant. It's an old-school sort of difficulty: when you die, it's almost always your mistake, and not because the game is unfair. That kind of challenge makes Tembo particularly satisfying and intense. When I fought one of the early bosses — a mechanical dragon that needed to be pushed into a vat of lava — I found myself moving my body along with my hands, trying everything to get the machine over the ledge. An otherwise fun game turns into a slog Unfortunately, the wonderful gameplay is undermined by some terrible design decisions. For one thing, Tembo employs an unnecessary life system. Each level is filled with checkpoints, but when you run out of lives, you're forced to start over from scratch. This means that you either a) have to complete a stage without dying five times, which isn't always easy, or b) you'll need to play easier levels to farm for peanuts, which can net you extra lives once you collect 300. Running out of lives was fine in 1990 because we didn't know any better. In 2015, it just feels archaic. Even worse, certain levels are locked until you kill a specific number of enemies, many of which are hidden throughout the levels. This means that, unless you're fantastic at the game and can find and kill most of the bad guys in a single try, you're going to have to replay levels multiple times. Since Tembo's levels are very long and very challenging, this can turn an otherwise fun game into a slog. If the core of gameplay wasn't so fun it'd be hard to look past these frustrations, but Tembo is definitely worth playing even if you have to do some grinding. There are plenty of games that try to be retro, but Tembo is one of the rare few that actually channels what made 2D games so great: it's bright, fast, fun, and hard as hell. Just be sure to clear the room before you start playing. Tembo the Badass Elephant is available today on Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and PC.",0.6349367374244186,0.3650632625755814,0.16387407637205834,663,4.6530920060331828,375,5.6079999999999997,1,0,"Culture, Entertainment, Gaming, Games Review"

This isn't the most uplifting John Oliver video you'll ever see, but it does end on a positive note.

That means borrowing a variety of techniques from the military, including ""the idea of a war game."" ""It’s useful to compare our preparations for epidemics with our preparations for war,"" Gates writes in The New England Journal of Medicine. ""Defense budgets and investment in new weapons dwarf investments in epidemic preparation. NATO has a mobile unit that is ready to deploy quickly. Although it’s not a perfect system, they do joint exercises where they work out basic logistics like how fuel and food will be provided, what language they will speak, what radio frequencies will be used. When soldiers sign up to serve, they know what the risks are and who will take care of them if they’re injured or killed. Few if any of these things exist for an epidemic response."" ""An avoidable crisis""Almost 25,000 people in those three countries have been infected with Ebola as of March 15th, and 10,000 people have died, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The virus is still spreading; 116 new cases were confirmed in the week before March 8th in Sierra Leone and Guinea, according to the World Health Organization. Liberia is faring better — there have been no new reports of confirmed Ebola cases for the last two weeks. The epidemic has been characterized as ""an avoidable crisis"" by Jeremy Farrar of the Wellcome Trust and Peter Piot of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, in a September editorial in The New England Journal of Medicine. The outbreak began in December 2013 in Guinea, but the WHO wasn't notified until March 23th, 2014. The WHO didn't declare the Ebola crisis a global emergency until August — when more than 1,000 Africans had already died of the disease. The global response was ""highly inadequate and late,"" Farrar and Piot write. ""The world spends a great deal of money getting ready for war.""The ideal warning system would be coordinated by a global agency with ""enough authority and funding to be effective,"" according to Gates. That's not the WHO, he says — the organization isn't ""clearly chartered or funded to handle most of the things required in an epidemic."" Gates also writes that the global health community should increase its investment in developing new tools for diagnosis and treatment, as well as improving the global health warning system. Also, the global community should establish a NATO-like force of trained people and run preparedness drills to help identify any weak links, he says. ""The world spends a great deal of money — hundreds of billions of dollars a year — getting ready for war,"" he writes. ""I am not saying this is a mistake, but given that an epidemic is more likely to kill millions of people than a future war, I believe we should build on these efforts so we can be more prepared for a severe epidemic.""

In his most recent hearings on the matter, Cruz lambasted the agency’s focus on Earth science and climate change, saying that the ""core function of NASA is to explore space."" He said this to NASA administrator Charles Bolden, whose take on the mission of the agency was a little more general: ""Our core mission from the very beginning has been to investigate,  explore space and the Earth environment, and to help us make this place a  better place.""

Cruz’s view of NASA is a sort of call back to the idealized vision created in books like The Right Stuff — a group of rough and tumble space cowboys quite literally shooting for the Moon. It’s the same refrain once sung by President George W. Bush, who wanted a return to the Moon. Both men have, at points, represented Texas, where Johnson Space Center serves as the lead for crewed spaceflight in NASA’s facilities, and both have proposed ambitious goals for the agency. Bush’s vision, the Constellation program, was cancelled in 2010. Calls and emails to Cruz’s office seeking comment weren’t returned. Also worth noting: NASA's 2015 budget has already passed, and the agency received more money than it requested. Any real showdown won’t kick off until 2016 negotiations begin. Though Cruz is a space booster, he's also the same man who said of climate change in that CNN interview, ""Climate change, as they have defined it, can never be disproved, because whether it gets hotter or whether it gets colder, whatever happens, they’ll say, well, it’s changing, so it proves our theory."" Cruz has also said that there hasn’t been any warming in the last 15 years. Never mind that the existence of climate change is the consensus of the scientific establishment, which near-unanimously agrees that it’s happening and humans are causing it. What's more, according to scientists: 10 of the hottest years in recorded weather history have taken place since 1998, and 2014 was the hottest year on record. though cruz is a space booster, he takes a dim view of climate change. So who’s keeping track of those temperatures? Well, NASA, alongside the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Cruz is overseeing NASA within the Subcommittee on Science and Space; like-minded Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) oversees NOAA from the Subcommittee on Oceans, Atmosphere, Fisheries, and Coast Guard. Neither senator is particularly friendly to the scientific consensus on anthropogenic climate change. Both are overseeing the governing bodies tasked with gathering the data.     NASA got into the official business of Earth sciences in 1976, when Congress vested more authority in them for ""national needs,"" which included monitoring of the ozone layer and pollution from space. The Apollo-Soyuz mission had flown the year prior, and the next crewed mission wasn’t to take place until 1981 with the launch of the Space Shuttle. It was at this time, 40 years ago, that the agency transitioned toward prioritizing planetary sciences. The Voyager missions were launched in that time, some of the most ambitious exploratory missions performed by the agency. The Viking probe performed astrobiology experiments on the surface of Mars. And, on the home front, the first satellites dedicated to monitoring Earth’s ecosystems went into orbit, including the Seasat-A to monitor the oceans and the Nimbus 7, which monitored ozone depletion. The business of NASA thus became less on crewed exploration, and more on mass collection of scientific data of our solar system. Cruz released statements criticizing the agency’s work on climate change, saying in budget negotiations that the Senate ""must not sacrifice funding for NASA’s core mission of space exploration to continue expanding climate change funding."" But in his initial hearings on the agency, Cruz has largely remained mum on his goals, including his vociferous denial of anthropogenic climate change. As reported by Space Policy Online, a February hearing was largely devoted to less reliance on Russia for space launches and the expansion of the commercial space industry. They remarked that Cruz seemed inquisitive rather than confrontational, and climate change scarcely came up in the hearings. But Cruz's first meetings with NASA officials in a Space Subcommittee meeting showed a more combative side. Cruz and Colorado Sen. Cory Gardner made clear that for them, the core mission of NASA was space exploration, not any of the agency's other scientific pursuits, like monitoring climate change from space. Of course, it will be more difficult to put people in space if sea levels rise and ""Kennedy Space Center goes underwater,"" notes Sen. Bill Nelson (D-FL), who is one of NASA’s staunchest defenders in Congress — and who flew as a payload specialist on a shuttle mission in 1986. By the end of the hearing, Cruz made clear his intent to jettison some of NASA's scientific missions during funding discussions. He says he wants to see a return to the ""hard sciences"" — apparently excluding environmental science — and getting NASA's focus back to space. Space is big business in Texas, giving NASA a bit of breathing room. Cruz can’t go after NASA with the ferocity of some government programs in the crosshairs of other budget slashers. The Johnson Space Center is located in Houston, and the private aerospace industry — companies like Raytheon, XCOR, Boeing and SpaceX — have operations in the state. In fact, 153,000 Texans were employed in aerospace or aviation in 2012, and it accounted for $5.6 billion in exports. Cruz also wants NASA to rely less on international partners for space launches; this includes Russians ferrying Americans into low-Earth orbit on the International Space Station. Given frosty relations with Russia, the statement would hardly come as a surprise on either side of the aisle. And in fact, NASA has already given SpaceX and Boeing contracts to send American astronauts to the ISS starting in 2017.   As for Russia, the country has committed itself to the ISS through 2024. After that, though, it will focus on a separate space station. Of all the international collaborators on the International Space Station, Roscosmos is currently the only one capable of crewed missions. (China is launch capable, but does not participate in the ISS.) It's not clear, though, what Cruz's focus on an independent NASA means for other international partners like the European Space Agency. NASA teamed with ESA for the Ulysses sun probe in the 1990s as well as Hubble and the succeeding James Webb Telescope. ""Less reliance on international partners"" is vague enough to suggest fewer partnerships with them in the future, as well. Cruz supports the Orion capsule and the Space Launch System heavy lift rocket. But he's a little less clear on  possible destinations for Orion and the SLS. Future missions will be determined by hearing, whether ""to an asteroid, the moon, Mars, or beyond,"" he's said. As for planetary science, like the successors of the current Dawn, Cassini, or New Horizons probes? Cruz is surprisingly mum. He's silent, too, on Mars exploration and future space telescopes. Cruz’s chairmanship isn’t a death knell for NASA, or a new paradigm shift toward a crewed mission to Mars in the next five years. What does seem likely are showy budget fights, with NASA’s role in climate and earth sciences at the center. One thing seems certain: Cruz will be attacking the agency’s climate science components. If Cruz has his eye on the presidency in 2016, he’s going to be making those budget negotiations as dramatic as possible.",0.5865079738943977,0.4134920261056023,0.885367703480043,1437,5.1064718162839249,707,6.4469589816124468,0,20,"Science, US & World, Report"

They attack the nervous system by interfering with electric signals in the brain — a change that usually prevents a victim from breathing. To stop their effect, researchers have tried to make synthetic compounds that can break down nerve agents. Now, a lab-made compound appears to be able to do just that, in a matter of minutes. it broke down half the nerve agent in three minutes Nature came up with ways to break down chemical weapons long ago. Natural enzymes called phosphotriesterases can deactivate pesticides and certain types of nerve gas in milliseconds, Science reports. Unfortunately, these enzymes aren’t very stable; they degrade easily. So researchers decided to improve upon nature's design. By copying the mechanism that allows these enzymes to deactivate nerve agents in a more stable compound, they were able to come up with a chemical — called NU-1000 — that can survive inhospitable environments, according to a study published in Nature Materials yesterday. The researchers tested their synthetic creation on a pesticide that’s chemically related to nerve agents. They found that NU-1000 was able to break down half of the pesticide in about 15 minutes — a timeframe that handily surpasses past results obtained from synthetic compounds. Then, they sent their compound to a US Army facility, so it could go up against the nerve agent GD — a chemical weapon that's actually more toxic than sarin. Scientists found that NU-1000 was able to get break down half of the nerve agent in about three minutes, or 80 times faster than similar synthetic compounds. the compound is still too slow to use during an attack NU-1000 is ""extraordinarily effective,"" the researchers write. But it isn’t really good enough. Right now, the compound is too slow to use during an attack, or in gas masks. Thankfully, the researchers already know that achieving a better result is possible.

But the complaints aren't responsible for the change, Nature reports. NIDA's willingness to expand the types of plants available to researchers is tied to the fact that legal marijuana is becoming increasingly available. ""We want to be able to evaluate the claims that marijuana is therapeutically beneficial."" ""We want to be able to evaluate the claims that marijuana is therapeutically beneficial,"" Nora Volkow, director of NIDA in Rockville, Maryland, told Nature. The pot that NIDA gives to qualifying research groups is grown at the University of Mississippi. In 2014, the farm increased production from about 40 pounds to more than 1,300 pounds, and NIDA increased its spending on research marijuana by 50 percent. The University of Mississippi also started growing two new strains of marijuana, which will be available to researchers soon. One of them contains high levels of cannabidiol, a substance that isn't hallucinogenic but that appears to have therapeutic effects. This should allow researchers to evaluate pot's ability to reduce pain, for instance. Despite this change, the University's plants still aren't as strong as the stuff you can get elsewhere. NIDA's strongest pot contains 12 percent THC — pot's primary psychoactive component — whereas most of the pot that's seized by the DEA contains 20 percent THC. Moreover, researchers have to jump through a number of hoops to get their hands on the expensive plants. NIDA currently charges scientists $7 per cigarette — far more than the clinical-grade pot grown in Canada and Israel, Nature reports. And the application process is so long that the Colorado government asked the US federal government if it would allow universities in the state to grow their own pot for research. Colorado legalized recreational marijuana in 2012, but because the drug remains illegal under federal law, researchers in Colorado can't use it in their research. NIDA's monopoly on research marijuana may be coming to an end, however. Legislation backed by Republicans and Democrats alike was introduced in the US Senate on March 10th. The  bill would let at least three more FDA-approved institutions cultivate marijuana for research purposes. The bill would also get rid of the review process that can add years to a study's approval time.",0.544124045887356,0.45587595411264403,0.833113364284776,438,5.2146118721461185,247,6.0647773279352224,0,0,"Science, US & World"

When they're released, they get up to 450 meters in the air. At that altitude, the plane starts doing large circles in the sky, which turns the plane's propellers. The drag turns each of the eight propellers into individual turbines that send 600 kilowatts back down to Earth.  Google has been working on wind turbines for some time now, thanks in part to its purchase of the energy company Makani Power in 2013. But the turbines it has flown so far measured 28 feet in length.

Chris Borland, linebacker for the San Francisco 49ers, told ESPN that he was retiring because he wanted to do what was best for his health, and didn't think football was ""worth the risk."" By leaving the league at only 24 years old, after a stellar rookie season, Borland rapidly becomes one of the most damning examples of the NFL's ongoing concussion crisis. Thousands of players have sued the NFL over head injuries Borland says his decision to quit came from him wanting to ""be proactive,"" leaving the sport while his brain is still healthy. The linebacker began to have doubts about his long-term career as a professional football player in his very first NFL training camp, during which he received a suspected concussion on a running play but decided to play through it in a bid to make the team. He told ESPN ""I just thought to myself, 'What am I doing? Is this how I'm going to live my adult life, banging my head, especially with what I've learned and knew about the dangers?'"" After the fourth game of his rookie season, Borland told his parents his time as a pro player would be short. The linebacker told ESPN that he currently feels as sharp as he's ever been, but that he had researched the issue heavily, speaking with concussion researchers and former players, more than 4,500 of whom have sued the NFL for failing to adequately protect them from head injuries during their time in the league. In his statement, Borland thanked the 49ers, saying the team ""truly looked out for players' best interests,"" but his departure from the league is made even more notable by coinciding with the exit of several prominent young players. Borland was scheduled to be one of the stars of the San Francisco 49ers defense, playing the last season as the heir apparent to Patrick Willis, another top-tier defensive player who chose this year to retire from the sport after developing chronic pain in his feet. He was joined by by Steelers linebacker Jason Worilds, who announced this month that he was retiring from pro football to pursue other interests. Four players 30 and under have announced their retirement this month The NFL has had a long-running problem with concussions and head injuries, and its lackluster methods of protecting players, as detailed in the PBS documentary League of Denial. Many who have played the sport have gone on to suffer debilitating brain diseases. A number of players, including standout San Diego Chargers and New England Patriots linebacker Junior Seau, have committed suicide in the years after their retirement. Seau shot himself in the chest so his brain could be studied after his death — after autopsy, it was determined that he had been from chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a type of degenerative brain damage found in other players. The NFL has made advances in technology designed to help reduce head injuries, but players such as Jahvid Best, a former first-round draft pick who sued both the NFL and helmet maker Riddell after receiving three concussions in two years, are still receiving knockout blows on the field of play that could disable them in later life. The league has also come under fire for a too-weak concussion protocol that allows clearly woozy players back onto the field. In October last year, Chargers defensive back Jahleel Addae played an entire game after being knocked out on the first play. In the fourth quarter, several hours after taking the blow to the head, Addae seemed to lose control of his body after making another hit, jerking his limbs and stepping awkwardly as he attempted to stay upright.  &amp;amp;lt;mce:script src=""https://platform.vine.co/static/scripts/embed.js"" mce_src=""https://platform.vine.co/static/scripts/embed.js""&amp;amp;gt;&amp;amp;lt;/mce:script&amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;lt;/p&amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;gt;By ducking out of the league now, Borland avoids the risk of taking hits like the one on Addae that could cripple him, reduce his mental faculties, or send him flying into rages in later life.

The same two topics — autonomous driving and the connected car — have been pervasive here for well over half a decade, and they’re showing no signs of going anywhere. It’s not that there isn’t still plenty of news to be made in those categories, but the news has become incremental. Cars are now expected to have touchscreens and internet connections. Pretty much every automaker has proven at one time or another that it can make a car drive on its own. It raises the question, what’s next? When every car has Android Auto and CarPlay compatibility, a configurable instrument cluster, and a self-driving mode, what will be the new hot automotive topic in the first week of every January? I posed the question to Don Butler, the ex-GM exec now responsible for Ford’s connected car program. ""There’s going to be a mass of data that becomes available once you’ve got this computing power and once you’ve got this connection,"" he says. ""Consumers need to trust that that data is going to be handled in a responsible way."" In fewer words, Butler is suggesting that automotive privacy and security is going to become a dominant conversation at this show in the coming years. Modern cars are rolling boxes of data, rife with computers and the connections to ferry information in and out. Of course, privacy has become a huge deal elsewhere in recent years — smartphones, massive hacks, PRISM — so connected cars can’t be far behind. Privacy is boring, though. Tremendously important, yes, but ultimately boring. The substance that sustains CES’s life force is sizzle. What’s the next sizzle for cars? CES 2015 gives us an early, tantalizing glimpse at two possibilities. Two automakers here, BMW and Volkswagen, are demonstrating fully functional gesture-control systems. They sound gimmicky, but after seeing them in action, I’m convinced that they’re the real deal: they’re less finicky than voice recognition, and unlike a touchscreen, they don’t require that the driver divert a single moment of their attention. A wave of the hand requires a lower cognitive load than hunting for an ""end call"" button. And these systems aren’t merely concepts — BMW has committed to rolling out gesture support in production cars within a year or two. Next, look for car sharing to become a dominant topic. Zipcar already does this well, but automakers want in: Ford made a long series of announcements about pilot programs that it’s conducting around the world, including several specifically focused on car and ride sharing. It seems counterintuitive for car companies to take an interest in it — more sharing of cars would suggest fewer cars being sold, which is inherently bad for business. Butler disagrees. ""The way we look at it, we could either have the future thrust upon us, or we could go forward and boldly try to form the future in a way that makes sense, both for us as well as our customers, as well as the greater good of the world,"" he says. ""Those things are going to be coming, right? And we can kind of pretend to ignore it and just say, ‘no no no, I’m going to keep selling vehicles the way I do, and I just hope I can hold on.’ No, we want to be a part of that solution going forward."" A number of other automakers are engaged in car sharing programs around the world, including Mercedes-Benz and BMW. Make no mistake — this week, giant in-dash displays and self-driving cars are still as newsy as ever. But soon, they won’t be, and car companies seem to know what they’re going to be talking about next. CES is a car show now, after all. Andrew Brenner, product manager for Android Auto at Google, sounds like he was basically born for the job: he got it, he says, because he'd hacked the dashboard of his own car with a Nexus 7. Now, he's picking me up in a Hyundai Sonata equipped with a near-production build of his software. We're going to get married. Nvidia isn’t selling LED-embroidered, heatpipe-cooled GPUs; it’s pitching an all-encompassing vision of the future connected car. It doesn’t seem to make sense — and in its full, blooming, overreaching glory, it really doesn’t — but a more tempered, less ambitious version of the plan announced by Nvidia at CES actually makes perfectly good sense. The watch has a circular app navigation menu, a slick and circular calendar app, and a quick settings menu that's also best viewed on a round screen. Audi's participation in this timepiece is limited to a branded watch face and an app that unlocks the car door via NFC. Ford is trying something different, displaying some interesting incremental improvements for the present. It just announced a service that uses shared data from cars across the city to help others find open parking spots. That will partner well with two other experimental apps. On stage at his CES keynote, Ford CEO Mark Fields and product development VP Raj Nair announced that the company is testing ride-sharing systems in London, New York, Germany, and India — in other words, systems that would help you not buy a Ford. BMW showed off a couple near-future technologies that'll be available on cars in the next few years. The first doesn't really sound futuristic at all — it's just a generic Samsung tablet, but the magic is in how tightly BMW's managed to integrate it with the car's systems. The ""Touch Command"" system includes the small Android tablet and a dock in the rear seat, allowing rear passengers to change climate settings, switch radio stations, adjust their seats, and more — in other words, it's basically a portable iDrive controller for when you're getting chauffeured around. The F 015 Luxury in Motion — yes, ""Luxury in Motion"" is part of the car's name — is basically a sleek pod with a huge passenger compartment, a fortuitous side effect of an imagined future where we spend most of our times chilling out in cars while they drive us around all by themselves. Mercedes actually calls the cabin ""lounge-like,"" thanks to four rotating seats that can face each other. High-performance hatches like the GTI and Golf R are a big part of Volkswagen's bread and butter, but they've never really been known as bastions of high technology. That might be changing today with the introduction of the Golf R Touch at CES, a concept that pushes the dashboard to the bleeding edge. First, I got a glimpse of a collision avoidance system using an array of fairly well-concealed external sensors on one of the i3s. BMW set up a bunch of big, soft blocks dressed to look like walls and other hazards — it was a little Super Mario-esque, come to think of it — and told me to punch the gas in their direction. That's a tough command to process, and it took me a second to work up the courage. Nvidia's demo infotainment system has five main areas: one each for music and in-car controls, one for smartphone integration via things like Android Auto, one for viewing feeds from cameras around the car, and a final one for navigation. Nothing's incredibly fancy about this interface, but the 3D navigation is presented in a really cool, ghostly look, and is navigable via the typical touchscreen gestures. The redesigned Volt is a huge deal for General Motors: it's the first rethinking of the company's ""extended-range electric"" drivetrain since the debut of the original Volt in concept form in 2007. (Former GM CEO Rick Wagoner himself rolled onto stage in a Volt at a CES keynote in 2008.) This unit is meant to upgrade a dumb car into a smart one, a fresh take on the AsteroidParrot has been selling for years. The company says the new system is compatible with 90 percent of the cars on the road today, anything that can fit a double DIN sized CD player. General Motors' OnStar division is announcing that it's launching a ""driver assessment"" program in cars that will track how well drivers drive — hard braking, hard acceleration, and so on — and offer detailed feedback after collecting 90 days' worth of data. Afterward, they'll have the option of forwarding the data on to Progressive as part of its Snapshot insurance discount program, where you can get discounted insurance rates for driving well. The app gives drivers the ability to access remote vehicle operations right from their wrists, such as starting and stopping the engine, locking and unlocking the doors, and activating safety features like flashing the headlights or honking the horn. Users will be able to locate their car or call roadside assistance from the app as well.

No frills or chrome; just a standard auto console encasing. The control knobs are large, simple, and unassuming. It looks, as Chris Ziegler points out, like a monochrome Etch-a-Sketch frame.

Kotsu, which has more than 3,000 cabs in Tokyo and some 23,000 vehicles in the country, will supply the rides, but Line will handle the payments — using its new mobile payment platform Line Pay to process all transactions.

British taxi app Hailo is also available in Japan in the cities of Osaka and Tokyo.

TechInAsia adds that in its own comparison of Line Taxi and Uber, it was Line that offered ""better coverage and shorter wait times"" for cars in central Tokyo.  Line's taxi app features its ever present retinue of cartoon mascots. (Line) The launch of Line’s taxi service underscores the company’s growing ambition.

Okay, not quite — we're heading over to the KISS Hotter Than Hell Wedding Chapel, one of (I can only imagine) many Gene Simmons-themed holy places in this city. Android Auto is going to get us there.    At this point, we've seen Android Auto in show cars a number of times, but never on the road. The system requires an Android phone (running Lollipop or better) that's plugged into the car, which then offers a special UI in the dash display that's specially designed to limit driver distraction. Voice dictation factors heavily into it — not surprising, considering the work Google has done in that space — but it's also in the way Material Design has been simplified, stripped down to its bare essentials. Brenner says that guidelines state that nothing should require the driver take their eyes off the road for more than a second and a half, and that certainly seems plausible after I spend time with it. Material Design has been simplified, stripped down to its bare essentials It's also responsive. Requiring Lollipop (and the hardware specs that come with it) probably helps, but touch lag is virtually nonexistent — a far cry from the wonky own-branded navigation systems pushed by most automakers. Basically, between this and CarPlay, I'm pretty convinced we're looking at the future here. You know your smartphone, it works great for playing music and navigating to places — seeing it seamlessly move over to your car only makes sense.

The exhibition is called Digital Revolution, and from July 3rd to September 14th it will explore the impact of technology on art over the past 40 years. It will feature artists, designers, musicians, architects, and developers to reveal the artistry that's all around us, from the films that we watch to the games that we play. DevArt, its final act, will showcase three large-scale, “magical” works of art from established artists, and one that's yet to be announced. That’s where you come in.  At the core of DevArt is a new website and competition from Google that hopes to inspire coders to get creative, and offers them the platform on which to do so. The winner of the eight-week competition will have the opportunity to exhibit their artwork in the DevArt area at the Barbican.  In addition to the main prize, one project will be highlighted on the site’s front page each week — it’s a massive opportunity for some serious exposure. ""Art isn't just the output but the entire development process."" The winning piece will be exhibited alongside artworks from three of the biggest names in digital art, and all of them will be developing their work in public through the DevArt site. “What we're trying to show,” explains Google Creative Lab’s Emma Turpin, “is that art isn't just the output, but the entire development process.” Anyone visiting DevArt will be able to follow the projects, look through each artist's code, and see that code slowly refined and developed into the final exhibit. Zach Lieberman is one of the artists that will be developing his idea for DevArt. He’s been working in the field for over a decade, regularly creating new artworks, and he also co-authored openFrameworks, an open-source tool kit that helps others to code creatively. His work uses technology to create unexpected experiences, often incorporating gesture, sound, and more than a little showmanship.  Lieberman’s piece for DevArt is tentatively titled Play the world. It will allow visitors to play on a keyboard that samples sounds, in real-time, from hundreds of radio stations around the world. Play a ""middle C"" on the keyboard, for example, and it may pick up a matching note from a sports radio show in Nigeria, or a bossa nova station in Brazil. The keyboard is surrounded by a circle of speakers, and the sounds will be ""geographically oriented"" depending on where in the world they've come from. Like most of Lieberman's art, what's going on behind the scenes is highly complex — scanning hundreds of the world's radio stations while simultaneously analyzing pitch is no easy feat — but to the person playing that keyboard, it should feel effortless. Taking a different approach are Varvara Guljajeva and Mar Carnet, better known as Vavara + Mar. They’ve covered a vast range of topics with their work, but the results are always clever, playful, and leave a lasting impression. In 2012 they turned a São Paulo skyscraper into a giant metronome that beat to the ""rhythm of the city"" based on social media activity. Their DevArt piece takes the now-everyday occurrence of speech recognition and injects a healthy dose of whimsy.  Titled Wishing Wall, it attempts to reimagine how we share our wishes with the world. Visitors will be invited to tell their wish to the wall, where the words will transform before them into a butterfly. These butterflies will be generated by analyzing speech and determining the sentiments behind the words used, and the result will be a giant wall of wishes represented by butterflies that visitors can then interact with. The final commissioned piece will come from Karsten Schmidt, whose name will be familiar to many Londoners. His malleable, open source digital identity for the Decode exhibition at the city’s V&A museum captured the public imagination, and his new work will expand on the co-authorship ideas he first introduced years ago.  Co(de)factory (another tentative title) will play out like a performance, and, much like the DevArt competition itself, it gives the public a starring role. Schmidt has created a set of 3D-modeling tools and will invite the public to contribute a small section to a larger work either online or using computers in the DevArt area. When completed, these works will be printed live at the exhibition using a UV 3D printer, an almost theatrical machine that appears to ""grow"" objects from a photosensitive liquid using UV light. At least one of these collaborative artworks will be printed every day and exhibited in the space, and over 70 will be printed over the duration of the exhibition. Taken at face value, the three projects couldn’t be more different, but all will be created much in the same way any piece of software is. The message is simple: all you need is an idea, and the ability to code it, and you can create amazing things. Anyone can sign up for the DevArt competition and start coding, regardless of experience; it even connects up with the popular software development site GitHub, so would-be art superstars just need to link up a GitHub project and updates will be pulled into their DevArt page automatically. Through the competition and exhibition, Google and the Barbican hope to encourage creative coding, but more importantly, they’re looking to show that code can be, and often is, art. Technology is everywhere, and the people that create it and create with it are, and always have been, artists The Barbican has successfully showcased digital and interactive art for years, notably with 2012's massively popular Rain Room, but Digital Revolution is more than that. It’s a dizzyingly ambitious show that will feature historic pieces like vintage arcade cabinets alongside contemporary work from the special effects teams behind Gravity and Inception; video games from small indies and larger developers like Harmonix, the team behind Rock Band and Dance Central; a multitude of audio exhibits from artists like Philip Glass; and what sounds like a rather special collaboration between Will.i.am and audio artist Yuri Suzuki, who’s currently crowdfunding a synthesizer that can turn anything into a musical instrument. Through Digital Revolution, and perhaps no more so than with DevArt, the Barbican wants to tell the world that technology is everywhere, and the people that create it and create with it are, and always have been, artists. Digital art is art. So what’s in it for Google? DevArt is the brainchild of Google Creative Lab, a free-thinking arm of the company that showcases why, before the data collection, and before the privacy scares, so many of us fell in love with the company. It’s an in-house design agency, a brand consultancy dedicated to just one company. It employs top-tier designers, developers, and technologists who are encouraged to create, innovate, and experiment for the good of Google. It was instrumental in the redesign of most of Google’s services that saw aesthetics and usability as equally important qualities, and it’s also quite unique in its willingness to work with other companies to show what’s possible with Google services. As you’d expect, DevArt showcases more than a few of these services, with all of the exhibits tapping into a couple of Google properties like its Cloud Platform or Maps API. ""Developers and coders are the new creatives."" Discussing DevArt with Conrad Bodman, guest curator at the Barbican, and Steve Vranakis, executive creative director at Creative Lab  London, it’s clear that they’re far more enthusiastic about the exhibition than the opportunity to promote Google services.  Both firmly believe in the idea developers and coders are ""the new creatives,"" and technology is the canvas for that creativity. ""What we really wanted to show,"" says Vranakis, ""is that if you give the platform and the opportunity for coders to express themselves creatively they could make something incredible."" As Bodman talks through his plans for Digital Revolution, Vranakis’ face lights up in excitement over the who’s who of artists being name-dropped. Usman Haque, whose company Umbrellium creates massive, interactive urban installations is also involved, and he’s apparently working on a giant interactive exhibit involving lasers that everyone is looking forward to. They’re looking to transfer that excitement to a new generation that has yet to discover digital art, and coding in general. The timing, in the UK at least, couldn’t be better. As the exhibition ends and begins to move its way across the world, computer programming will, for the first time, be taught to all children in England from elementary school through to high school. The children that come flocking to Digital Revolution this summer might be wowed by the lights and interactive elements, but what they take away to their new programming classes could be far more important. ""If a 10-year-old girl [visits DevArt]"" says Turpin, ""we want her to understand that coding can make butterflies fly and land on her hand, and show her the magic behind what they see. And that magic’s code.""",0.8929629252184066,0.10703707478159341,0.8220975091710413,1532,5.0874673629242819,734,6.4972752043596733,0,0,"Culture, Design, Google, Tech, Report"

""Adopting a poetic approach, The Ark gives voice to the garden’s plants, participants in the work, the beating heart of the space and an unpredictable choir,"" writes Tardy. The project is one of many from the group AntiVJ, a ""visual label"" of European artists who work primarily in the medium of projected light. Like his previous work, O (OMICRON), the light show re-imagines what was arguably already an intriguing physical and cultural space as something new: in this case, a sentient garden that evokes the one in Avatar, the James Cameron film.  Whether or not that was the intention, it's worth watching the result. Just know that you're not getting nearly the full idea in the video and photos below.

Rams attended a grad show at the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, California last year, giving an hour-long talk on design in addition to taking the time to critique and discuss the graduates' work. ""It still brings a smile to my face."" Among the graduates presenting their work was Andrew Kim, a young Korean-Canadian designer who rose to fame in 2012 for a bold redesign of the Microsoft brand. In both a video released by Art Center and a blog post on his site, Kim describes the experience of meeting with Rams, who he describes as a ""superhero."" Rams was apparently impressed with a camera concept of Kim's, which uses a single dial to control all its settings. ""[Rams] understood my intention of the singular dial. That’s all I needed,"" says Kim. ""There’s nothing that can mean more than Rams telling me that he appreciated something I had designed. It still brings a smile to my face."" Even before graduating, Kim was snapped up by Microsoft's Xbox team, where he now works on future products.  As well as offering critique and praise, Rams gave his opinions on the pitfalls of modern design. He notes that computers are capable of helping to produce perfection, but should not be allowed to influence the designs they help create. The designer famously doesn't use computers, preferring to work by hand. He also shared his thoughts on some of the more experimental designs at the show, apparently telling some designers to ""make sure you spend your creativity doing something that's useful."" Rams wasn't at the show by coincidence. He toured Art Center prior to receiving an honorary degree from the college. As well as attending the grad shows for product and graphic design, he gave an hour long talk on design at the center. Rams' opinions are fascinating; he discusses how ""design"" as a word has been ruined by marketers and the fashion industry, and a more appropriate word is gestalt, the German for ""form"" or ""shape."" He also expands on his 2011 comments that Apple and its lead designer Jony Ive had achieved something he never did, praising the iteration of existing designs, rather than constantly coming up with new concepts, pointing to the iPhone as a good example.

Excepting the Olympic rings, there's no drawn element here, leaving the viewer to construct his own metaphors — such as the apparent reflection between Sochi's name and the year 2014, which has been argued to suggest the duality of combining tradition with innovation.   In discussing the logo's design with The New Yorker, Guo Chunning — who designed the Beijing 2008 emblem — says he was surprised by its minimalism and lack of a graphical element. Nonetheless, you don't have to go far to find the flair and outward confidence that the Sochi Olympics represents for Russia: a lot of the branding that the country is doing will actually manifest itself through the designs splashed across official facilities, transportation, merchandise, and apparel. That's where you'll find more direct invocations of Russia's art heritage with colorful and distinctive patterns.  While the Russian look is an intriguing mix of understated and provocative aesthetics, it'll come up against stiff competition for attention from a pair of North American competitors.

Typeset in the Future painstakingly analyzes the typefaces in all the notable scenes in 2001, even investigating the historicity of the corporate fonts used by the likes of IBM, Pan Am, and Howard Johnson's. Kubrick himself, according to the site's analysis, also used fonts to create mood and a sense of time. For instance, the ""Dawn of Man"" sequence uses the Albertus font, which looks appropriately ancient given the context. Eurostile Bold Extended vs. Univers 67 Bold Condensed What's really interesting is the tension Kubrick apparently creates with the font he uses when everything is fine and what he uses to connote things are going wrong. 2001 makes ample use of Eurostile Bold Extended, which would go on to gain considerable popularity in sci-fi. Later on, however, the fonts Futura and Univers show up more and more — on warning labels and life-sign terminals — to show things as they start going south.

The project was completed about a year and a half ago, but because of restrictions from its collaboration with Objet—it, Blossom has only just been released for the public to see. Clarkson used what he describes as ""simultaneous deposition of different build materials in a single print,"" which means different substances were used in various amounts during one print job. The rigid structure of Blossom's flower is made of Fullcure 720, a clear, solid substance, and the flexible petals are made of a rubbery black material called Tango Black. By designating how much of each material to use at the point of print, Clarkson was able to create each section with the correct amount of rigid and flexible materials to make the organic form of a flower.   When filled with air, the flower's rubbery petals ""bloom"" by pushing outwards, while the center remains solid. The outer portions of the petals contain less solid resin than the parts toward the stem, allowing them to maintain their natural shape as they expand.

Swift's label pulled her catalog shortly after the release of her new album, and accused Spotify of paying a pittance for her spins. Spotify CEO Daniel Ek fired back in his own blog post, saying Spotify has paid out $2 billion in royalties to artists so far and that this number was poised to grow rapidly. Spotify's revenue nearly doubled in a year Today we got some hard data to back up Ek's argument. As reported by The Guardian, a filing covering Spotify's finances for 2012 and 2013 showed that it generated more than $1 billion in revenue for 2013, nearly double what it earned in 2012. It also came a lot closer to turning a profit, with its overall revenue increasing at a faster clip than its costs did. As Recode's Peter Kafka points out, this positive growth is what enabled Spotify to raise fresh funding at a $4 billion valuation. In a lot of ways, both sides in this debate have a point. Streaming revenues aren't likely to add up to the same kind of paydays that artists made in the days when people still bought physical records, at least not for a long time. At the same time, album sales have been in decline for many years before Spotify even came on the scene. As industry analysis shows, the growth in the music industry is coming from streaming.   In fact Spotify says Taylor Swift is a good example. It claims to have paid her $2 million in total royalties over the last 12 months, but to have been on pace to pay her $6 million over the next year, before she pulled her music.

In an interview with The Washington Post yesterday, Cuban said that he was in favor of creating ""fast lanes"" on the internet that would ensure the quality of certain services. He’s a man who has always had plenty of opinions, and he’s certainly entitled to them, but in this case, it’s worth pointing out what a hypocrite he sounds like, pushing a position that would have been a death blow to the very startup that made him so rich in the first place. The bulk of Mr. Cuban’s wealth comes from the sale of a company he created, Broadcast.com. How did he build that company? To quote Wikipedia: Permission-less innovation is what we have now This is the picture-perfect example of the permission-less innovation that the internet has fostered. A pair of entrepreneurs had an idea and built it using a set of free, open protocols that connected them to tens of millions of consumers. How well would this same idea have worked in a world full of dedicated ""fast lanes"" on the internet? Terribly. In a world where companies are allowed to pay to prioritize their data over others, consumers will naturally gravitate toward the services that work best. One of the biggest pain points for data flowing over the internet will be streaming video, especially live video, exactly the kind of thing Broadcast.com specialized in. If ESPN and the NFL can afford to pay for priority lanes to deliver their data, what chance does a young startup with limited cash really stand? Cuban, in arguing for fast lanes, cites a few benevolent uses that might justify special treatment. Priority for data to doctors using apps or for machine vision technology that would help the blind to surf the web. No doubt these are noble ideas, but in a world where fast lanes are legal, every corporate entity with a profit motive will take advantage of them. Cuban reveals his naked self-interest In fact, later on in the interview, after the bit about doctors and computer vision, Cuban, who owns the Dallas Mavericks basketball team, slips off the mask and reveals his naked self-interest. When asked about services that stream data which doesn’t count against a user's monthly cap, he replied, ""If T-Mobile came to me and asked me if I wanted to subsidize their consumers getting [Dallas] Mavs games streamed live over their phones or to mobile home routers, without impacting their data caps, I would love it, if the price was right, and would do it in a heartbeat."" Let’s slow down for emphasis here. Cuban is saying he wants to pay for certain data to get preferential treatment, so sports fans can enjoy Mavericks basketball without it counting against their data, much like T-Mobile's current streaming music offering. If Broadcast.com was a new startup today, and consumers were choosing between the Mavericks game on a T-mobile sports app and the one on Broadcast.com that would eat up their data plan, which one do you think they would choose? Ayn Rand must be spinning in her grave  Cuban, like so many successful businessmen, is a devotee of Ayn Rand and her writings on Objectivism. He has often argued for the purest form of laissez-faire capitalism, in which the best ideas and execution win out, free from onerous government rules and regulations. Net neutrality, he assures us, would enrage Rand and will ruin the internet, just like government intervention wrecked the railroads. But here’s the thing: our internet service providers don’t exist in a true free market. Cable providers and telecom companies function like utilities in many respects, with a single provider blessed by the government to tear up the roads and move through private property to lay the infrastructure needed to deliver this data. That’s why President Obama, among others, has called for the FCC to reclassify broadband internet service as a utility. And it's why Verizon, when it needs to lay fiber for its FiOS service, calls itself a Title II common carrier, in order to get taxpayer subsidies and rights of way for construction. Cuban fails to grasp Net Neutrality's true meaning What Cuban and many others fail to grasp is that net neutrality has always been about ensuring those monopolistic internet providers don’t play favorites. Open internet advocates don’t want things to change, but rather to stay the same. Net neutrality has always been about preventing rich incumbents from stomping out new ideas. It’s actually about fostering just the kind of world Cuban and Rand claim to love. It’s shameful that a man who benefited so greatly from that level playing field is now advocating to destroy it.

The unit will be priced somewhere between $500 and $1,000, putting it into competition with drones from DJI, Parrot, and 3D Robotics. Why is GoPro bothering to sell its own drones, as opposed to simply partnering with one of the existing players? After all, lots of drones already have a mount for GoPro cameras, and those that don’t often work with custom gimbals to which a GoPro can attach. Wouldn’t GoPro be better off sticking to its roots and enjoying the spoils by proxy? Drones and cameras are complimentary products Flush with cash from its recent IPO, GoPro can afford to take a gamble on a new product line in an effort to diversify its revenue streams. Drones are also a marvelously complementary product: buy a drone, and suddenly you will have a lot better reason to upgrade to their next camera, or vice versa. And as companies like DJI and Parrot introduce drones with their own built-in cameras, GoPro wants to avoid getting cut out of the action.  GoPro also has ambitions of being a media company, helping to shoot and distribute real-life adventure footage. Drones already play a big role in shooting insane video of skiers, surfers, and other outdoor athletes, and it stands to reason that GoPro would want to be a one-stop shop for getting those shots. Fortunately for GoPro, it won’t be that tough for it to build a highly competitive unit. Drones, in some ways, are just like the remote control helicopters people have been flying for decades. Add a couple extra rotors, strap on a camera, sure — but at their most basic level, they’re just RC quadcopters. The additional smarts packed inside drones are, for the most part, commodity hardware born of the mobile era. Drones are the peace dividend of smartphone wars ""The components in a smartphone -- the sensors, the GPS, the camera, the ARM core processors, the wireless, the memory, the battery -- all that stuff, which is being driven by the incredible economies of scale and innovation machines at Apple, Google, and others, is available for a few dollars. They were essentially ‘unobtainium’ 10 years ago. This is stuff that used to be military industrial technology; you can buy it at RadioShack now,"" explains Chris Anderson, the former editor of Wired who left to start 3D Robotics. This transformation, what Anderson calls the peace dividend of the smartphone wars, makes it possible for GoPro to create its own drone in just a year or two, without breaking the bank on R&D. Getting into consumer-focused drones is a whole lot easier than commercial ones. Google and Amazon, who both have ambitions to own your shopping experience, are looking into the potential for drones to act as autonomous aerial delivery services, but the FAA has yet to provide clear rules about how such drones can be used, keeping new business ventures on ice. The largely unregulated market for consumer drones, on the other hand, is exploding. In the last month, exciting new units have arrived from DJI and Parrot, while 3D Robotics has hired DJI’s former North American CEO Colin Guinn and is promising its own consumer competitor soon. GoPro is flying into an increasingly competitive market GoPro, therefore, is stepping into a crowded playing field. Its well-established brand and credibility in the very markets it’s trying to capture will surely help it to move some units, especially if GoPro’s athletic celebrities help with the marketing push. Over the long term it will have to compete with these other companies on specs, price, and performance, but for now, the drone market is far from saturated. There is still plenty of room to introduce consumers to the space for the first time and to delight them with a unit, which — considering the price — might not be the most powerful offering. The CEO of DJI, speaking recently at the launch event for its new Inspire One, called the unit not a drone, but an ""aerial camera."" His perspective makes sense. We call these new devices drones, for lack of a better term, but they are really aircraft, cameras, and a smartphone bundled into one. We haven’t even begun to scratch the surface of what they will allow us to do yet, or how big the consumer market for them could get.

Let’s take Google, one of the best and most cohesive set of web services we have, and fragment it into smaller businesses. Let’s introduce friction and bureaucracy between the various parts so that lesser companies with worse products can have a chance to compete. It feels like a classic case of over-regulation — penalizing a successful company for the crime of being better than everyone else — however its fundamental premise is not wrong: Google is too powerful. There’s no denying that Google has merited its current dominance in web search. The service that has grown into a verb is used all around the globe because it’s reliably accurate, up to date, and comprehensive. Google supplements the basic results from its search algorithms with advertising — its primary source of income — and links to its own related web services like Maps, News, and YouTube. For the vast majority of users, this cross-promotion of Google products is helpful: it expands the format of search results beyond a mere index of web links and does it with arguably the best services in each category (Google+ ignominiously excepted). Seen in isolation, Google’s efforts to keep users locked inside its ecosystem are scarcely objectionable, but their success has created undesirable market distortions that EU regulators are trying to correct. Are we really getting the best of the web if Google prioritizes its services over others? The primary point of contention between Europe and Google is the latter’s status as an internet gatekeeper. Google underplays this, but the company commands roughly 90 percent of all web searches in Europe, making it the starting point for almost everyone’s online queries. This works fine so long as Google can be trusted to maintain high quality and unbiased results, but what happens when the company’s ""do no evil"" mantra slips? Are we really getting the best the web can offer if Google is demoting competitor sites and promoting its own? It just so happens that right now the best on the web and the best from Google usually coincide, but the situation sours when the two diverge. Adding Kelkoo and Shopzilla shopping searches where relevant — as Google has proposed in previous negotiations — might not improve on Google’s own results, but it gives the user visibility on what alternatives exist. This is a direct means for disciplining Google to stay competitive: a failure to find and provide the best prices cannot be masked by the comparative anonymity of specialized search engines. Any regulatory action would start from this basic premise of ensuring equal opportunity to be seen for both Google and its rivals.   A search for hotels today sees Google’s algorithmic results pushed halfway down the page, relegated below the paid-for ads and Google’s own hotel search service (which earns Google commission if used to make a booking). To established companies like Booking.com or Expedia, this means either paying to be seen at the top of the results or suffering a loss of business. The same is true of flights and, as commerce continues to move online, could be expanded to every type of transaction we make online. Google isn't so much a villain as a big clumsy giant Alternatives like DuckDuckGo exist, but without proactive users who are keenly aware of Google’s shortcomings, there’s not much in the way of competitive pressure on the incumbent leader. A self-regulating market requires that people can switch suppliers regularly in response to the quality and price of service — like buying the freshest produce in a real market — but most Google users are stuck in the inertia of long-established habit. It would take some extraordinary incursion into our privacy or convenience to prompt us to make a change. The European Union doesn’t perceive Google as a villain so much as a clumsy giant that’s having deleterious effects on other web businesses. As Europe’s authorities seek to build a single digital market — one that includes a strong commitment to net neutrality — they see Google’s ability to manipulate search results and give preference to its own services as an imbalance to be corrected. It wouldn’t matter if Google controlled a small segment of web searches, but the company is the de facto search engine for the entire continent. The latest vote from Europe doesn’t compel Google to do anything, but its suggestion of ""unbundling"" search from other commercial services is certainly the most aggressive language we’ve yet heard, as it would dramatically undermine the nexus of Google’s profitability. Talk of breaking up the company is premature when it's actively negotiating For its part, Google has been cooperative and at least acts like it wants to avoid a rerun of the protracted drama surrounding Microsoft’s bundling of Internet Explorer with the Windows operating system. Both cases involve a company dominant in one market using its position to ensure an advantage in another. After many years of wrangling, the solution for Microsoft was to offer a fair choice for the way that users get online, and a similar compromise is sought with Google now. It’s perhaps a sign of lesser patience in the newly appointed EU regime that we’d hear the nuclear language of suggesting Google should be broken up. That’s certainly not necessary. What’s needed is for the company’s unprecedented influence to be reined in so that its profits don’t come at a greater cost to others. Unlike the Microsoft saga, an agreement between Europe and Google has been extremely close in the past and looks likely to come in the near future. It’s just a matter of deciding how many concessions Google will make to its competitors and how visible they will be. The Randian nightmare scenario of Google having to break up is unlikely to ever come to pass, but the company does need to change. If Google is to continue serving as the gateway through which most internet queries pass, it must be held to a standard of fairness that’s above and beyond that required of a private company.",0.5856641559030206,0.41433584409697943,0.17340751712932864,1024,5.0732421875,533,6.5272045028142589,0,2,"Business, Google, Tech, Editorial"

One involved comments by Uber executive Emil Michael, who, while at a private dinner in New York, suggested spending $1 million to dig up dirt on journalists using a team of ""opposition researchers.""

Twitter is today introducing a service in the US called Twitter Offers, which allows companies to provide in-store and online deals and discounts right from a tweet. The deals will appear in promoted tweets, and anyone on Twitter will just have to click a button to claim them. If their credit card is already stored on Twitter, the deal will become associated with their card and will automatically be redeemed once it's used to make a corresponding purchase.  Advertisers will be able to track how many offers are being used, even in stores Offers is an interesting approach to serving up deals, and it could make Twitter a lot more useful for companies that work off of repeat purchases, like a coffee shop. Companies that rely on in-store traffic will be able to offer deals on Twitter and let people easily claim them for later use in stores. That's also important for Twitter — uses of these deals will be tracked, which means companies will know if they're effective or not. If they are, it could become a strong ad offering for Twitter on its continued path toward increased profits. The downside for people claiming these offers is that it appears they aren't activated immediately upon purchase. Rather, Twitter says that the discounts will be applied to a card statement several days after the purchase is made, which may make buyers a little wary as they wait to see whether the offer was successfully redeemed or not. This is also just the latest way that Twitter is beginning to bring commerce to its platform. Back in September, it began allowing companies to place buy buttons inside of tweets so that people could make purchases straight from their feed.

Mohrer reportedly still has his same job at the company, and Uber officials are not making public any of their own findings into the matter. Still on the job Mohrer was accused of improperly using an internal ""God View"" tool that lets employees track the location of both Uber vehicles and customers that are using the system. According to a recent report in Buzzfeed News, Mohrer used the tool to track the whereabouts of Buzzfeed reporter Johana Bhuiyan while she was on her way to a meeting at Uber's Long Island City headquarters. Under Uber's own privacy guidelines, that tool was explicitly limited in use to ""legitimate business purposes,"" prompting questions into how many people at the company had access to it. When asked for more detail on any sanctions against Mohrer, an Uber spokesperson said only that ""the review by [law firm] Hogan Lovells that is already underway will evaluate our privacy policies and practices, including employee training and compliance.""

Lee Min-bok, a North Korean defector, tells AFP he's completed four balloon launches since January, with the latest carried out in the dead of night on Saturday. CNN accompanied him on Saturday's launch, which sent more than 80,000 copies of the Seth Rogen-directed movie and one million anti-Pyongyang leaflets across the border. The Interview, released last year, was denounced by North Korea as an ""act of terror"" for depicting the assassination of Kim Jong-un. The FBI blamed North Korea for carrying out a massive cyberattack against Sony Pictures in response to the film, which was eventually released online in December after major US theater chains pulled out. ""it shows Kim Jong-un as a man, not a god."" ""The regime hates this film because it shows Kim Jong-un as a man, not a god,"" Lee tells CNN. ""He cries and is afraid like us and then he's assassinated."" With CNN's camera team in tow, Lee tied the DVDs and leaflets to helium-filled balloons, and released them from an undisclosed location near the border at around 3AM local time. A timer was set to release them once the balloons were in North Korean territory, though it's impossible to say where the DVDs ended up.  (CNN screenshot) Lee isn't the first to use so-called propaganda balloons to penetrate North Korea's hermetic borders. Last January, a group of defectors used the same tactic to send DVDs, USB sticks, and transistor radios into North Korea, where the internet and outside media is tightly controlled. In October 2014, North and South Korea exchanged fire after a group of South Korean activists launched propaganda balloons across the border. In January, North Korean defector Park Sang-hak said he would use balloons to deliver subtitled copies of The Interview on DVD and USB sticks to his former country, as part of an effort to dispel ""the idolization of leader Kim."" Last month, Park said he was moving forward with plans to send 10,000 copies of the movie into North Korea, though he added that the event would not be publicized. As CNN reports, Lee chose to carry out his launches at night to avoid clashes with South Koreans living close to the border, who have grown uneasy since forces clashed over balloons in October. South Korea's Ministry of Unification declined to comment directly on Lee's campaign, with a spokesman telling AFP: ""Our stance is that we continue to acknowledge the freedom of individuals to publicize their opinions.""",0.43458946652594477,0.5654105334740552,0.8743464013126278,444,4.9639639639639643,258,5.8372093023255811,1,2,"Culture, Entertainment, Policy & Law, US & World"

The effort was unsuccessful, as a Vine employee captured the covering of the statue later that day. 2:14pm ET: The bust has been fully removed; we've updated the piece accordingly.

And there's a good chance that everything you've heard has been overwhelmingly positive: the show has been hailed as the ""rom com of the year,"" ""a rom-com dream,"" and the start of a ""romantic comedy revolution."" My expectations were high, and I watched the (way too short) six-episode series in a rush of anticipation. But it still managed to surprise me: this isn't what I expected the romantic comedy revolution to look like. But I'll take it.  The premise of Catastrophe is simple: Rob (played by Twitter favorite Rob Delaney) is an American who accidentally gets a one-night stand (Sharon Horgan) pregnant during a business trip to London. So Rob moves across the Atlantic, and he and Sharon try to make their relationship work, largely through a process of finger-crossing and forced coupledom. Everything that follows is done in the hopes of creating a monogamous, stable relationship. Rob looks for a job, Sharon gets an ultrasound. As far as sitcoms go, Catastrophe is minimalist In the hands of other actors, this could've been dangerous territory. Take the show too far in a bumbling-couple-takes-the-fast-track-to-adulthood direction, and you've got Knocked Up. Take it too far in another, and you've got a Lifetime special about pregnancy after 40. But Catastrophe is neither of these things, because Delaney and Horgan keep things teetering on a crooked fault line somewhere between chaos and comedy. That fault line is just the natural reality of life (the tendency of humans to be dumb and selfish and scared), but most comedies can't seem to explore such mundane truths without throwing a bunch of wacky shit at it. As far as sitcoms go, Catastrophe is minimalist. Delaney and Horgan co-wrote the show, but they're also its main characters, and their relationship is pretty much the entire plot. Catastrophe's forward thrust is based on their pre-existing relationship; there's no ""will they or won't they"", because they already have. And that's what makes Catastrophe so unexpected: it's a sitcom about one couple, who are a couple by the time the first episode ends, and who, presumably, will remain a couple until the end of the series. Nothing about this structure suggests it will work. Because of its one-relationship focus, the show plays like a feature-length movie. More often than not, network sitcoms that try to do this — Selfie, Manhattan Love Story — get canceled. Shows like The Mindy Project and New Girl lean on buddy comedy tropes and kitschy side-characters to cushion their true-love plotlines. There is some of this in Catastrophe — Rob's ribald friend Dave, Sharon's tragically obtuse friend Fran — but it's a small group without real storylines of their own, who seem to exist mainly for laughs. There's no ""will they or won't they"" because they already have In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Delaney noted that there was only one scene in the first six episodes that didn't feature either him or Horgan. But it's this kind of detailed, intimate continuity with the two main characters that makes Catastrophe work. Delaney and Horgan force the audience to watch the smallest progressions of their love — in one scene, Rob clips Sharon's toenails — and rather than feel like a waste of time, it's charming and rewarding. Horgan and Delaney's chemistry is warm and easy, and their relationship, while not being exactly ideal, is pleasantly sufficient. A big part of Catastrophe's plot is not that Sharon and Rob are in love, rather, they've just decided that this is the relationship they're going to stick with. So we agree to stick with it, too. But all this romantic singularity raises the question: how far can this show actually go? Catastrophe is smart, irreverent, and refreshingly disabused of any notion of soulmates or the miracle of pregnancy. It's been renewed for a second season, but how do you keep an audience invested in a single couple over the course of several seasons? I'm convinced if anyone can do it, Delaney and Horgan can, but somewhere along the way, the initial premise might find itself wearing thin. Will the show still get mileage out of Sharon's irritation and Rob's doofy optimism after a few years of marriage? In the final episode, Rob and Sharon's relationship doesn't exactly seem stable, but there's also never any real fear they're going to break up. The stakes — other than an impending baby — are pretty low, so there's not much incentive for Catastrophe to break its mold. The relationship now is fresh and unpredictable, but what happens when Rob and Sharon (and the fans who love them) get past the honeymoon phase? I only ask because I don't want to wake up one day and realize this was all just infatuation.",0.49102547412183856,0.5089745258781615,0.15100286589016673,813,4.9717097170971707,443,6.0586907449209928,0,0,"Culture, Entertainment, TV"

Abrams' Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Penned by sci-fi / fantasy novelist Chuck Wendig, Aftermath's story begins where the revised version of Jedi ended: with the destruction of an Emperor Palpatine statue on Coruscant. What happens following the fall of the statue is included below. If you're weary of spoilers, consider yourself warned. And if you'd like to read more from Aftermath, including a speech by Admiral Ackbar, and details about the book's Wedge Antilles-centirc story, visit EW. Chains rattle as they lash the neck of Emperor Palpatine. Ropes follow suit—lassos looping around the statue's middle. The mad cheers of the crowd as they pull, and pull, and pull. Disappointed groans as the stone fixture refuses to budge. But then someone whips the chains around the back ends of a couple of heavy-gauge speeders, and then engines warble and hum to life—the speeders gun it and again the crowd pulls— The sound like a giant bone breaking. A fracture appears at the base of the statue. More cheering. Yelling. And— Applause as it comes crashing down. The head of the statue snaps off, goes rolling and crashing into a fountain. Dark water splashes. The crowd laughs. And then: The whooping of klaxons. Red lights strobe. Three airspeeders swoop down from the traffic lanes above—Imperial police. Red-and- black helmets. The glow of their lights reflected back in their helmets. There comes no warning. No demand to stand down. The laser cannons at the fore of each airspeeder open fire. Red bolts sear the air. The crowd is cut apart. Bodies dropped and stitched with fire. But still, those gathered are not cowed. They are no longer a crowd. Now they are a mob. They start picking up hunks of the Palpatine statue and lobbing them up at the airspeeders. One of the speeders swings to the side to avoid an incoming chunk of stone—and it bumps another speeder, interrupting its fire. Coruscanti citizens climb up the stone spire behind both speeders—a spire on which are written the Imperial values of order, control, and the rule of law—and begin jumping onto the police cruisers. One helmeted cop is flung from his vehicle. The other crawls out onto the hood of his speeder, opening fire with a pair of blasters—just as a hunk of stone cracks him in the helmet, knocking him to the ground. The other two airspeeders lift higher and keep firing. Two of those gathered—a father and son, Rorak and Jak—quick-duck behind the collapsed statue. The sounds of the battle unfolding right here in Monument Plaza don’t end. In the distance, the sound of more fighting, a plume of flames, flashes of blaster fire. A billboard high up in the sky among the traffic lanes suddenly goes to static. The boy is young, only twelve standard years, not old enough to fight. Not yet. He looks to his father with pleading eyes. Over the din he yells: ""But the battle station was destroyed, Dad! The battle is over!"" They just watched it only an hour before.

There are two reasons why this is a problem: 1) music is a vital part of my life — I need a steady stream of new tracks and artists to listen to, and I need to be able to cue up my old favorite songs at crucial moments — and 2) I strongly suspect there is no perfect way to listen to music. But sometime in the mid-aughts, I came close. The system I developed then represents the most fruitful and healthy relationship I’ve ever had with music. I spent money on used and new music — a good Amoeba haul would sometimes set me back $40 or $50 — but as a college student in a post-Napster world, I did my fair share of pirating, too, and ripped countless CDs borrowed from the college radio station I worked at. I uploaded my entire music library to my fourth-generation iPod, while still continuing to use the CDs in my stereo at home and in my friends’ cars. Part of my collection was based off recommendations, part of it was made up of canonical must-listens, and some of it was completely random. Some songs I only listened to once; others became my favorite songs of all time. It was during an afternoon of idle browsing at the station that I found the album Wonder Wonder by alt-country singer-songwriter Edith Frost. Most of that album wasn’t really my style, but the fifth track, ""Cars and Parties,"" became a sturdy old friend to me in my first transitory years living in Los Angeles. Now, of course, all that hard work and illegal activity has been rendered obsolete. Even if I had a computer with a disc drive, ripping CDs feels as archaic as taping songs from the radio, and downloading illegal MP3s is a headache, even with a lightning-fast cable connection that 2004-me would have died over. Streaming has become the new standard ever since Spotify became available in the US in 2011; other contenders such as Rdio, Rhapsody, and Tidal have tried to win a part of the ""every song whenever you want it"" market with varying success. I caved and signed up for a Spotify Premium account back in 2011; but there are lots of things about the service I find frustrating, disorienting, and impersonal. Is there something better for me out there? I wondered. In the name of improving the very fabric of my life, I went on a quest to survey the streaming ecosystem, looking for the ultimate service. Over the course of a month, I tried as many other options as I could, spending at least four days with each one. Because the features they all offer were so similar on paper, I knew picking the best service would come down to a matter of interface and ambiance; an intangible addictive aspect more than a list of specs. Maybe I’ll be back, I told Spotify. Maybe not. What followed was the streaming music equivalent of a month-long Tinder bender — every bit as mentally and emotionally disorienting. Don’t worry, though. This breakup has a happy ending. At the height of my struggle with Spotify’s awkward interface, I went through and vengefully counted the taps it took to get into the app, find a song, and play it.   Six out of those 10 steps are necessary for turning off Spotify’s social function, a baked-in aspect of the service and a relic of a time when it still seemed like everything should be a social network. Some cling to that aspect of the service, but for me, listening to music is like eating; it’s fun to do with friends, but when you’re doing it by yourself the last thing you want is to be watched. I listen to a lot of dumb utilitarian music when I'm working out, and I’m not ashamed of that; I’m more than happy to discuss the specific merits of Britney Spears’ ""Til The World Ends"" in casual conversation — I just don’t find much use in telling my friends I listened to the first 3 minutes of deadmau5’s ""fn pig"" five times in a row as some kind of meditative post-workout intention-setting exercise. I would also, for what it’s worth, prefer not to have my streaming service infer certain things about my taste based on these isolated quirks. Thankfully, recommendations are not really a part of Spotify’s game. There are plenty of curated playlists based on mood, genre, and charts, which are both easily accessible and easily ignorable. For over a year I’ve been subscribed to a Detroit Techno playlist 382 tracks long that I can find conveniently listed with the rest of my personal playlists, but Spotify doesn’t try to shove Plastikman radio stations down my throat. Still, I don’t trust Spotify. In 2012, about a year after I started subscribing, a rift opened up in my account history. I had signed onto the app using a new work computer, only to find that all my saved music and playlists had been lost. Gone. I gradually rebuilt my stockpile, but from that moment on, the ephemerality of everything contained under that tab labeled ""My Music"" was never lost on me. Spotify is purely fine. But I think my entire relationship with it can be summed up by that great wipe of 2012 and the fact that for about two years it was automatically shuffling all of my playback, with no apparent option to turn it off. After an afternoon of failed troubleshooting, I gave up, and for the next year I had to manually tap on the next sequential track whenever I wanted to listen to an album in order. It was a pain, but a pain I accepted, because from that point on I associated Spotify with inconvenience and disappointment. Use if you: Would like to easily ignore curated playlists / stations Don’t use if you: Hate the idea of making your listening habits social I appreciate Tidal’s honesty. In New York, much of my listening takes place underground, away from an LTE signal, so offline listening is crucial. On Spotify, offline listening feels a little like alchemy — you can turn it on, and if the stars align correctly and your heart chakra is balanced, you may in fact be able to listen to a song you like on your next subway commute. When I turned on offline listening on Tidal, however, a message instantly popped up telling me I didn’t have enough space on my phone to use the feature. This was annoying, but at least it was a clear response. However, no matter how many files I deleted off my phone, I could never make enough room. I hopped back over to Spotify for a second, and sure enough, I succeeded in getting four songs onto my phone. I didn’t sign up for Tidal Hi-Fi, but still, those files must be huge. Another important test of any streaming service is how long it plays music once you’ve gone out of range: every morning I cue up music for the 5-minute walk to my train station, and once I go underground, the test begins. Is it still playing music after a minute? After 5 minutes? Unlike Spotify, which usually banks the next couple songs on deck, giving me up to 10 minutes worth of music underground, Tidal appears to be streaming everything a la carte. Even above ground, this leads to noticeable pauses between songs, pauses long enough that sometimes I have to check and make sure I still have a connection. This contributes to a broader, less quantifiable sense that Tidal doesn’t really have my back. Sure, its catalog is more or less identical to Spotify’s (though I did find some gaps — Jamie xx’s In Colour is tragically missing, so I listened to Kacey Musgraves’ Pageant Material instead), but it seems to be investing more of its effort in the star power of its guest playlists and exclusive content — which remains seriously wanting. (Why did Rihanna, a Tidal artist, release her ""Bitch Better Have My Money"" video to Vevo instead of Tidal?) If Spotify is the sturdy, unglamorous Hampton Inn, Tidal is a slapped-together luxury hotel with a touchscreen thermostat but no towels. Use if you: Need to know what J. Cole is listening to this week Don’t use if you: Are a snob about anything besides lossless audio Opening Rdio for the first time on my phone felt like stepping into a tastefully minimalist coffee shop. I wanted to touch everything. After spending a few days in Tidal’s dark, messy, Helvetica-dominated world, Rdio felt like suddenly being among grown-ups. This is probably not accidental; Rdio is one of the oldest players in this game, having launched their app in 2010. It’s a hybrid of encyclopedic streaming libraries like Spotify and more randomized streaming services like Pandora. Rdio wants you to take your hand off the wheel and let it curate a handful of personalized stations to your liking — while still giving you the ability to build your own ""library"" of albums and songs. This isn’t too different from Tidal’s philosophy, but Rdio is more oriented to the user than to the tastemakers and celebrities it's cobbled together in its playlist section. For that reason, I was way more open to submitting to its whims. And I do like to dabble in semi-randomized music experiences now and then — the less taps to get music in my ears the better, right? As an experiment, I selected Lana Del Rey as a favorite artist, and fired up Lana Del Rey Radio, a concept that should seem familiar to any Pandora user. The first song that came up was LDR’s ""Ride"" — so far, so Lana — but after that, I was horrified to see Ed Sheeran’s maudlin ""The A Team"" pop up. I see the algorithmic reasons for this: singer-songwriters who talk about troubled heroines! But I want to hear Lana sing about herself as a troubled heroine, not Sheeran’s obliviously earnest ode to a homeless addict. Rdio also lets you ""download"" albums for use offline, a feature which I used to put Miguel’s new album Wildheart on my phone. Adding anything beyond that proved a challenge with my consistently at-capacity storage space, so this wasn’t a feature I got a whole lot of mileage out of. Still, with all of these offline listening options, it’s hard to avoid the feeling that we’ve taken a convoluted path back to something we perfected years ago: putting goddamn mp3s on goddamn portable devices. Ultimately, Rdio is just Tidal with a more finessed UI and preprogrammed stations that happened to overlap more with my interests (I got a lot of mileage out of DJ-Kicks Radio). Both services are taking something Spotify pioneered — putting a huge library of songs at your disposal — and trying to add value via the quality of curation. It’s almost as if Tidal and Rdio have figured that Spotify perfected the library, and thus they haven’t bothered putting any resources into meaningfully improving the experience of using it. Would a hotly anticipated new player in the market be able to crack the code? Use if you: Will mostly be using your service for personalized and curated radio Don’t use if you: Will never use your service for personalized radio and curation At 11AM on June 30th, 2015, I began my iOS update. When my iPhone reset I would have access to Apple’s long-awaited streaming-music service, and I was standing on a cliff, arms outstretched, waiting for my corporate overlords to beam me up into their mothership and carry me off to a land of unlimited music and radio curated by people with better taste than me. As a relatively frequent iTunes user, I figured that adding streaming to the equation would automatically make Apple my one-stop shop for music consumption. I didn’t like that, but I assumed I was powerless against it. The first thing I was struck by upon opening Apple Music was how much stuff there was. Hot Tracks! Editors' Playlists! Songs to Make Up To! After mere minutes browsing through its various byways, Apple Music had cemented itself as the Cheesecake Factory menu of streaming options, surprising for a company that’s built a cult around its minimalism. The thing is, a lot of these corners of Apple Music are actually pretty intelligently curated. But there are so many of them that it’s easy to lose track of them. I had found some random zoned-out workout playlist at one point, and when I went to go find it again (having foolishly forgotten to fave it) I couldn’t remember if it was New, or For Me, or on the Curators' list. And merging your iTunes library with your streaming library is much more confusing than it should be; the playlists I saved from Apple’s extensive playlist library often vanished into thin air. (Due to what appeared to be a bug, I also completely lost the ability to create new playlists of my own.) If there’s one fun, if not flawlessly successful aspect of Apple Music, it’s Beats 1 Radio, which brings some of the in-the-moment tastemaker-driven discovery back to music. I had to admit, it had started to get lonely wandering around these faceless, vast virtual music malls. Beats 1 brought back a fraction of the unpredictable joy of a human curator; after a day or two checking in, I quickly learned that I enjoyed Julie Adenuga’s show more than Zane Lowe’s, and the New York ""city blocks"" were better than the Los Angeles ones. It’s a small pool to navigate, but it mirrored the kind of analog legwork I had trained myself to do growing up. Apple Music overlays iTunes’ existing ""star"" rating system with a binary ""heart"" system — stars are how ""good"" you think the music is, while hearts represent whether or not you want that song to be a part of your personal music delivery algorithm. This inspired some discussion among folks here at The Verge: What is a one star + heart song? What’s a five star + no heart song? It began to dawn on me that a broader shift was happening across all these streaming platforms: value was being placed on how often a song was being played, but not how much we actually like it. Björk is one of my favorite artists of all time, but I’m not going to tell Apple Music to deliver me a lot of random Björk songs; most times are not optimal Björk-listening times. Meanwhile, I’m playing a Justin Bieber and Diplo song three times a day. I bought Post as a physical album in high school; I’m never going to pay for a download of the Jack Ü album. And I suspect many other people have experienced a version of this. What do streaming platforms think they’re learning about our listening habits? Am I contributing to a future pseudo-meritocratic music dystopia? Should I get out while I still can? Use if you: Like the idea of contributing to a future pseudo-meritocratic music dystopia Don’t use if you: Use sharing functions frequently Once upon a time, I used Google Music — I vaguely remember uploading my entire music collection to the cloud in 2011. This was during what I recall being the second-best phase of How I Did Music in my life — I bought DRM-free mp3s off of Amazon (and acquired them through other creative means, too, of course) and drag and dropped them onto my Android phone. There was no syncing or streaming or clouds; these were all my files that I uploaded to a device via a USB cable. I rarely actually used Google Music because I was scared of the data charges, and it seemed redundant to select the library of music that I had hand-picked to actually live on my phone. But after several years of Apple just straight up losing many of my music purchases, I guess I expected my Google Music archive to be gone when I logged on for the first time in years. Giant data managing systems just naturally lose your data over time, right? Yahoo deletes my old mail account because I haven’t logged into it in years; Spotify just randomly decides to wipe my entire listening history. Somehow over years of life on the internet, I’ve convinced myself that that’s just nature happening. If I leave a Little Caesars pizza outside for four years, I can’t expect to come back and still have it be hot n’ ready. But when I opened Google Play Music and was presented with a list of ""recently played"" songs ported flawlessly from 2011, I was filled with a warm, pleasant sense of continuity that is frequently missing in this crazy, mixed-up, on-demand world. Even if it was still streaming them from some remote server, it was reassuring to see a collection of music and cover art that I knew I had personally amassed and organized. Much of it was music I hadn’t listened to or even thought about for years, but I was more than happy to be reminded of it. I cued up Battles’ 2007 debut Mirrored and left for work. Google Play’s interface feels familiar and intuitive, mostly because it feels like so many other Google apps on my phone. If Apple Music was a Cheesecake Factory menu, Google Music is the board at In N Out: your choices are slim and to the point: ""Listen Now"" (a selection of curated playlists for when you don’t want to think), Top Charts and New Releases (self-explanatory), and My Library. (If I had one gripe, it’s that artists and albums and playlists are listed as thumbnail blocks instead of lists, but it’s all still alphabetized and relatively easy to sort through.) If I’ve got to subsist on a streaming service, I’d much rather be streaming my own library of music and supplementing that with Google’s own encyclopedia. I’ve created my own filter on the years and decades of music available to stream, and when I want something I don’t have, I just toggle over to search and fill in the gaps. The music I chose to make readily available for myself throughout the reign of the mp3 is a kind of personal history; seeing an old Microphones EP I ripped in 2004 alongside a sleek, anonymous jogging track I starred earlier this year makes me feel like I’m experiencing music in my own subjective, illogical context again — not merely clicking play on every hot new release the service throws at me, or whatever ""favorite artist"" of mine I happen to remember with my Twitter-addled, increasingly faulty 2015 brain. Every once in a while, I’ll be walking somewhere at night and remember my old lonesome buddy, ""Cars and Parties."" For whatever reason, the track was never on Spotify — I’d check occasionally over the years just to make sure. As I walked home after my first day on Google Music, I flipped open to my Library, found Edith Frost under my artists, and, for the first time in years, heard the snare drum chugging in my ears. I was still beaming music into my brain from some faraway server that was probably watching all my activity with more judgy eyebrow-raising than any snobby record store clerk, but at least it was my music. Use if you: Have a large mp3 library you’d like to keep in your life Don’t use if you: Have the sinking suspicion that all of this ends in uploading your entire life to a corporate-owned cloud, and you’re seriously considering getting into vinyl and moving to the woods, in which case, I’m glad I could help Edited by Michael Zelenko ",0.6414816135753603,0.35851838642463973,0.165255274621948,3328,4.6442307692307692,1349,6.329132690882135,0,12,

There were points in favor of each — Sony didn’t have Halo, but Microsoft forced you to buy the Kinect, and so on. But it never felt like a momentous decision. You might miss out on a few games or spend a little more money, but you were fundamentally getting the same experience. For a little more than the cost of a phone, you could even buy both. In mid-2015, I’m going to start having a similarly serious conversation with a much smaller group: Morpheus, Vive, or Rift? And unlike the next-gen console debate, the virtual reality platform wars are going to be a complete nightmare.  Each major console has a few exclusive titles, but the vast majority of games are released across both. It’s not clear whether VR games will follow suit, at least in the early period. It’s way too soon to tell how many games will even support each headset, let alone be exclusive to it,  and several have publicly announced cross-platform partnerships. The VR world in general is far from bitterly competitive. But this is one of the few cases in which exclusivity makes perfect sense. Even with some major studios on board, a lot of the funding and support for VR games is coming straight from headset makers themselves. And the same game might feel very different on each platform. There's a lot to keep track of I can barely tell the difference between the Big Three’s screens, but the optics aren't all that matters. Microsoft and Sony might add a few distinct features to their consoles, and one controller might feel better, but the actual games usually involve hitting the same buttons in the same order to make the same things happen. That’s not true of VR systems. They can track slightly different ranges of motion, and the controllers each have distinct differences. Oculus wants you to play with a basic Xbox One pad, until the moment it releases its futuristic half-moons that can (to some extent) track individual fingers. Sony has the slightly awkward but time-tested Move stick. Vive gives you surprisingly precise miniature trackpads. Then there are the practical concerns — I can probably set the tracking Oculus camera on my desk, but I have no idea where to put Valve’s room-scanning laser beacons. There’s a lot to keep track of.  What I really want, obviously, is all of them. If it were just headsets, that wouldn’t be impossible. But add in the cost of upgrading my computer, buying Oculus’ new controllers, finally getting a PlayStation 4, and it looks more like I’d be paying thousands of dollars to turn my one-bedroom apartment into some kind of panoptic corporate mind-prison. Right now, the medium is still limited to highly committed enthusiasts, so it doesn’t matter yet. I already have an Oculus DK2 and five ancient laptops stacked around my living room, so I’m not all that worried about stuffing it with even more electronics. But I want everyone to want a VR headset. Not Google Cardboard or a plastic case for their phone. A powerful, sophisticated piece of hardware with great controllers, real location tracking, and a high-resolution screen. This isn’t the upgrade obsession of telling everyone that House of Cards would look so much better on a 4K screen. Top-notch VR isn’t just a difference in quality, it changes the entire experience. Using an external tracking camera dramatically improved my VR motion sickness. A better screen helped me see fine details and words that were previously blurry. Motion controllers aren’t just for playing with guns and swords, they’re a way to interact with your environment in more complex and varied ways than staring and clicking. That’s not to say high-end VR is always better, in the way that a laptop isn’t better than a smartphone. But we don’t treat those as interchangeable, either. Oculus already draws a line between its mobile Gear VR and the more powerful and expensive Rift. At some point, we might have reflect that split more clearly in the catch-all term ""VR."" For now, if somebody asks me about trying out this new virtual reality thing, I’ll probably end up giving an incredibly confusing answer. I’ve given it my best shot in flowchart form, but the truth is that it’s still an incredibly confusing question. The best-case scenario is that these exorbitantly expensive first-generation experiments will generate enough interest to quickly follow the path of many other gadgets — becoming cheaper, simpler, and more accessible.

I'm Jamieson, I'm still your host, and it's nice to be back trawling through new albums after last week's Song of the Summer extravaganza. I'm still getting used to this weird new Friday release day, but I'm hoping it hasn't affected my ability to bring you something you might not hear otherwise. There's a Spotify playlist at the end for your listening convenience, and you can check it out on Apple Music at this link. Feel free to share your own favorite cuts from this week in the comments. (Yes, the comments are on for this one — go nuts! Be nice! I'll read them over the weekend!)   Dornik, ""Stand in Your Line"": Stereogum premiered this one earlier this week, and it's the lead single from the British talent's upcoming debut album. (Dornik is due out on August 7th.) For a few years now, he's been releasing delicate pop-R&B cuts that fall on the spectrum between Michael Jackson's soft, gentle ballads and Prince's tighter, sharper work, and ""Stand in Your Line"" is no different. This one's all about his unrequited love for a female pal, and it'll scan as either sweet or a little bit pathetic depending on how many cups of coffee you've had today. I can't argue with the sound, though: dewy, pleading, just a few feet away from outright lust.     EZTV, ""Pretty Torn Up"": Here's something nice and easy from EZTV's fine debut, Calling Out. ""Pretty Torn Up"" is simple, jangling guitar pop, pitched into the sweet spot between vintage Tom Petty and the breezy, bright work of Real Estate. This song makes me want to head to the nearest park and throw a Frisbee with an adorable, perfectly trained dog.   Heather Woods Broderick, ""Wyoming"": This one was released in late May as a single from Woods Broderick's moody new album, Glider, and it rocked me when I heard it for the first time earlier this week. She reminds me of a few other women exploring the boundaries between rock, folk, and ambient music, people like Sharon Van Etten and Liz Harris' work as Grouper. They're all using powerful voices and patience to explore natural, expansive spaces. ""Wyoming"" is quiet and simmering until you realize it's vacuuming up all the sound around you, and it's a credit to Woods Broderick's masterful use of dynamics. You can drown in this if you're not careful. Lana Del Rey, ""Honeymoon"": ""We both know that it's not fashionable to love me."" I beg to differ, Lana — from what I can tell, almost everyone lost their minds over ""Honeymoon"" when it dropped on YouTube earlier this week. I can't blame them, because this song is very cool. Lana's best music comes when she's leaning into her character as much as possible, basking in that doomed glamour and filling in every square on your Lana Del Rey Lyrical Bingo Card. That's what you get on ""Honeymoon"": cruising down boulevards, guns and fires blazing in equal measure, violets and roses blooming like fireworks, every note and word stretched like taffy. It's also flat-out gorgeous: the harmony that arises when she sings the words ""dark blue"" is among the most stunning moments she's put together. I'm looking forward to spending many hours with Honeymoon wearing homemade flower crowns and pretending to smoke cigarettes, frowning.     Little Boots, ""Get Things Done"": Please forgive me for my laziness — I'm going to describe a song called ""Get Things Done"" from an album called Working Girl as ""businesslike."" (Go ahead, pelt me with your virtual tomatoes.) But that's exactly what this is: glossy, professional, and funkier than wearing a set of Prince socks underneath a three-piece suit. Victoria Hesketh also manages to turn raging all night into just another task on your weekly to-do list, and makes it sound more fun that way to boot.   Majid Jordan ft. Drake, ""My Love"": Drake premiered this sublime piece of house-R&B on his Beats 1 show last weekend alongside three other new tracks, and it's the best of the bunch by a wide margin. I like hearing Drake alongside singers who are more technically proficient because it brings out something different in his voice, an earnest, heavy quality — bless his heart, he gets an A for effort at the very least here. And that leads me to the other thing I like about ""My Love"": the way the cool, muted arrangement plays against the utter lack of vocalist chill on hand. These guys need to relax! This is a fine single, not an interrogation.   Matrixxman, ""Red Light District"": Here's some acid-spitting heat from San Francisco producer Matrixxman's debut album Homesick. The tones and rhythms here remind me a little of mid-'90s Aphex Twin, twisting and mutating different strains of electronic music into potent, stinging solutions. This is sharp and nocturnal, but it's playful too, and it gobbles up a pair of decent headphones.   Veruca Salt, ""The Gospel According to Saint Me"": These '90s alt-rock titans are back with Ghost Notes, their first album made by their original lineup in almost two decades. ""The Gospel According to Saint Me"" is both a perfect album opener and a bright, timeless ripper. Rock's not dead, y'all!   Years & Years, ""Worship"": With their fusion of The Weeknd's emotive vocal work and the buoyant electro-pop of Cut Copy and Hot Chip, Years & Years sound like a mad scientist's attempt to perfect pop in 2015. ""Worship"" was released a few months ago as a promo single from their full-length debut, Communion, which finally came out last week. It's one of my favorite songs on the album, bouncy and eager to please. Mercenary pop doesn't get much better than this.   Youth Lagoon, ""The Knower"": Trevor Powers won plenty of acclaim for his first two records as Youth Lagoon, 2011's The Year of Hibernation and 2013's Wondrous Bughouse, but I never connected with them — I found him a little too precocious, his blend of '90s psych-rock and dreamy fancy too precious for my taste. But I like ""The Knower,"" the first single from his upcoming Savage Hills Ballroom. It's tinged with some cynicism, some swagger, a bit of a mean streak, and that might've been the set of anchors I needed to find something in his work. I'm ready for more. Here's this week's playlist.

Oppo is now stepping in to fill the void left by the Note by introducing the 6-inch R7 Plus, a smartphone with a 4,100mAh battery and a microSD option.   The R7 Plus comes in a unibody enclosure made out of a magnesium-aluminum alloy, which is punctuated by a 13-megapixel camera module and a fingerprint sensor on the back. Up front, the 6-inch AMOLED display has a 1080p resolution and a subtle curve to its edges, which Oppo describes as evoking the grace and tactile feel of a violin's neck. 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage come as standard, with the latter upgradeable by up to 128GB more via the microSD card slot. There's a tradeoff to be made, though, as using the memory expansion slot takes up the space provided for a second nano-SIM. The processor inside the R7 Plus is Qualcomm's Snapdragon 615, which should prove sufficient for most purposes, but doesn't quite match up to the elevated standard set by this phone's massive battery and high-end construction. The biggest shortcoming of the Oppo R7 Plus, though, might be the lack of 4G support for the US. European and North American fans will be able to buy it via the Oppo Style online store, but Americans will only be able to use it on T-Mobile or AT&T without LTE.

Twenty years ago today, people were lining up at CompUSA or Best Buy at midnight. It wasn’t a new Call of Duty game, Apple’s latest iPod, or any type of hardware at all that shoppers were waiting for. It was software, and not just any software: Windows 95. Microsoft’s Windows 95 release on August 24th, 1995 was a highly anticipated launch. Jay Leno helped launch the software alongside Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, with a lot of jokes and the appearance of the entire Windows 95 development team on stage. It was a huge day for Microsoft with TV commercials blasting the Rolling Stones’ ""Start Me Up"" with images of the new Start button that we still (just about) use today. Microsoft even hired Jennifer Anniston and Matthew Perry to create an hour-long cyber sitcom all about Windows 95, and the software was so popular that 7 million copies were sold during the first five weeks. Away from all the fanfare around the launch, PC geeks were choosing between Pentium or 486 processors, IDE or SCSI hard drives, double-speed CD-ROMs, and Sound Blaster audio cards to experience the best of Windows 95. Microsoft added a lot of features to Windows 95, but the biggest was a new Start button, menu, and task bar that made it a lot easier to discover applications and navigate the operating system. Multitasking improvements and the graphical interface were a big leap from Windows 3.1 and the days of MS-DOS, but the interface was rather similar for Macintosh and OS/2 users at the time. Windows 95 wasn’t all about the Start button, though. Besides being a 32-bit OS, an important addition was support for long filenames, up to 250 characters. It sounds like a basic feature in 2015, but at the time it made naming documents a lot easier. Another big feature was the introduction of Plug and Play, to automatically detect and install hardware. While the process of Plug and Play has been greatly improved in more recent releases, Windows 95’s implementation was often referred to as Plug and Pray thanks to the often unreliable device install process that resulted in IRQ conflicts and lots of driver fun. Windows 95 had a lot of new features Microsoft had other equally ambitious plans for Windows 95. A new Microsoft Network (MSN) application came bundled with a prominent icon on the desktop. MSN was designed to provide access to email, chat rooms, newsgroups, and the first WWW homepages through a dial-up connection. Microsoft charged a monthly fee to access MSN, and if you used it for more than three hours a month, there were extra charges. It was the early days of the internet and dial-up connections, and MSN now exists as a web service through various tailored apps or a browser. Microsoft also introduced its first idea of syncing data between multiple machines in Windows 95. The My Briefcase aimed to sync files between a laptop and desktop machine, and in modern releases of Windows, it’s all cloud-powered thanks to Microsoft’s OneDrive storage service. Microsoft even introduced user profile support in Windows 95 to allow multiple family members to sign in and have their own separate profiles with links and applications.  If you weren’t happy with all the new features of Windows 95 then you could have purchased Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95 at the time. It included the Internet Jumpstart Kit (an early version of Internet Explorer), theme support, and a number of system utilities. Subsequent updates to Windows 95 also introduced new features before Windows 98 arrived three years later to improve things even more. Enjoy a brief look back at Windows 95 in the photos and videos below, especially Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer dancing to ""Start Me Up."" It’s classic, just like Windows 95.

This wireless deep brain stimulation technique could help reduce tremors in people who have  neurological illnesses like Parkinson’s disease. other techniques require a brain implant and a power source Deep brain stimulation isn’t new — but this technique sure is. In the past, researchers have done it using short pulses of electricity, and they’ve had very promising results. People with Parkinson’s disease saw a reduction in the amount of tremors they experienced, for instance. But the treatment isn’t very accessible; it requires brain implants, which usually need to be connected to a power source. This means that the procedure tends to be used as a last resort. In the study, researchers delivered a genetically modified virus into the brain of mice; the virus causes heat sensitivity in specific neurons. Then, the scientists injected magnetic tiny ion oxide particles into their brain tissue and exposed them to an external magnetic field. This caused the particles to heat up and stimulate the neurons.   Credit: Ritchie Chen and Polina Anikeev   The particles mostly stayed where they were they were injected, the researchers say, which means that humans who suffer from neurological diseases might be able to receive this treatment for up to a month. They also don’t seem to interact with the brain tissue unless they’re heated, the researchers report. Still, this was a preliminary mouse study, which means that the technique needs to be tested a number of times before it can be used on humans. To make the process easier, the researchers developed nanoparticles with precise sizes and shapes. They also made a device that makes delivering a magnetic field more efficient.

The highest cold-related deaths rates are found rural parts of New Mexico and Arizona. Moreover, weather-related deaths — from heat, cold, storms, and lightning — are up to seven times more likely to occur in poor counties than in rich counties throughout the US. When temperatures take a rapid dive, there’s always a risk that someone might die from exposure. Over 5,800 people died because of cold temperatures between 2010 and 2013, reports the CDC. But considerably more deaths occurred outside cities in the western US, where the death rate was about 20 deaths per million, compared with rural areas in other regions, where the death rate was 4.5 to 7.8 deaths per million. In addition, the risk of dying from cold temperatures is generally lower in the country’s urban centers, where the death rate ranges from 2.9 per million to 5.0 per million.    Paying for heat or shelter isn’t always easy in the rural West, an area that’s plagued by a high rate of poverty. Still, the CDC says that it’s unclear why this region sees more cold-related deaths. The rates may have something to do with the fact that these areas experience rapid temperature shifts, especially at night. High elevations also increase a person’s risk of suffering a cold-related death. The people who are most at risk for cold-related deaths are African Americans, elderly individuals, infants, men, and people who suffer from chronic medical conditions, such cardiovascular diseases and respiratory diseases, according to a 2014 CDC report.

Not only am I blindfolded by an Oculus Rift as I feel my way around, the headset is sporting a 6-inch-high, slightly wobbly 3D-printed antenna. The Rift isn’t wireless, so I’m tethered to a laptop, which a research assistant is carrying around behind me. My gait lurches from tentative single steps to single-minded strides to sudden stops — sometimes because I’ve clipped through a wall in virtual reality, sometimes because I’m about to run into one in real life. A 50 x 40-foot box isn’t even big enough to fit the scoreboard in Virginia Tech’s Lane Stadium. But for me, the room looks like the giant venue, full of 60,000 spectators in the midst of evacuating. The audience is represented by tiny boxes, torrents of them streaming through a simple replica of one wing, mixing and jostling each other as they pass. If I walk slowly, I can match their pace. A little faster, and my speed multiplies, until walking briskly in the Cube shoots me through the stadium and straight into empty blue space.    These digital seven-league boots are just one piece of the massive puzzle that Benjamin Knapp, director of Virginia Tech’s Institute for Creativity, Arts, and Technology (ICAT), and other researchers are trying to put together. In most of the tech world, virtual reality is slimming down and becoming more accessible, as developers learn to create simple experiences that anyone can enjoy. Inside the Cube, it’s messy, complicated, and ambitious. The Cube is a new initiative, but it fits with Virginia Tech’s long history of virtual reality research. In the mid-’90s, the school unveiled a CAVE (a recursive acronym for Cave Automatic Virtual Environment), a 10 x 10-foot enclosure with stereoscopic 3D images projected on every side. A successor to the CAVE — now called the Visionarium VisCube — is still around on campus, and two Cube researchers have previously worked on Visionarium projects. Originally built as a black-box theater, the Cube is shared between ICAT and Virginia Tech’s Center for the Arts, used for both art projects and scientific research. This doesn’t necessarily have to involve VR; in 2013, the Cube theater hosted a live performance called Operacraft, where K-12 students used Minecraft avatars — projected onto a wall — to perform an opera sung by Virginia Tech musicians. One of the Cube’s biggest selling points is its sound system, which creates deafening 360-degree audio with 124 standard speakers, four subwoofers, and nine additional speakers that project hyper-targeted sound, like the aural equivalent of a spotlight. It’s possible to create things that could never be replicated with an ordinary sound system, like an experimental composition by ICAT media engineer Tanner Upthegrove that sends metal and chainsaws whirling around the room and wouldn’t feel out of place in Hellraiser. Close your eyes in another demo — a recording from inside a tornado — and you can almost feel the tremors as wind rips away nails and wood. The Oculus Rift tracks head movement with a single webcam, which reads an array of LEDs embedded in the headset. Alongside the speakers, though, the Cube is lined with 24 cameras, which read up to 24 rigid-body targets — small constellations of dowels and reflective balls. Tape one to a tablet or headset, and the wall cameras will be able to ""see"" visitors as they explore anything from a very large molecule to a very small tornado, mapped onto the dimensions of the room. ""The beauty of the space is that you now move through a virtual world by walking,"" says Knapp. ""I can explore this area in this space, and the model in this space, with you in there — and with anybody else."" A non-VR project called FutureHaus, for example, uses an old augmented reality trick: by holding up a tablet, you’re given a window into a simply rendered three-story home, its dimensions mapped roughly to the room. Unlike most other virtual rooms, though, whole groups of people can mill around the house, where they’ll appear as Prisoner-esque white spheres. FutureHaus drives home the loose connection between physical and virtual space in an almost eerie way. You can explore the house by climbing virtual staircases, sending your avatar up or down while you traverse the exact same space in the Cube. If you head to another floor and a companion stays behind on the lower level, you could hold hands and chat while your avatars walk several stories apart. A tornado visualization tool — unrelated to the audio installation — works with space in another way. Put on the Rift and you’re standing in a room about the size of the cube, getting a bird’s-eye view of a flat map. Instead of empty space, though, you’re looking at a bright, abstract funnel made of reds and yellows, representing the temperature of the air as a tornado sweeps across the ground. You can walk through it or kneel and see tiny topographic lines, while rocks and wind whirl around you in a small artistic flourish. Right now, it processes pre-recorded weather data, but one day it could provide a live feed, creating a real-time record of a disaster. The most interesting part, though, isn’t the image, which feels about as informative as a normal 3D render. It’s the sense of place. The simulation represents users as hovering green pyramids, tipped forward like an arrow. As I stood on the map, another pyramid floated toward me, representing Virginia Tech Department of Geography head Bill Carstensen. When Carstensen pointed out the eye of the storm by staring at it, he could have been poking at a screen, or drawing a red line in MS Paint. But actually peering through the 3D landscape, I could respond with the most intuitive interface of all: my own body. The demo was simplistic, but where so much VR feels like a blown-up version of a thing I could get on a screen, it gave me a real reason to use it. Designing for the Cube, though, presents its own set of challenges. There’s a tremendous amount of space to track, and since everything has to be portable, you can’t rely on having a super-high-powered PC to render environments. Normally, being able to walk around is a great way to avoid motion sickness. But the clunky FutureHaus demo sometimes ran at only a few frames per second, and the Lane Stadium evacuation simulator could get nauseatingly laggy. The Oculus Rift is currently hooked to a ThinkPad, which must be carried around, open, at all times. The next step will be putting the ThinkPad into a backpack, and after that, the team is looking at streaming video through a Raspberry Pi, which would make the headsets truly mobile. If you want to track fine motion, like hands, you’d have to strap on a Leap Motion or some other controller. For now, walking around in the Cube in a headset feels simultaneously retro and futuristic: you’re using a system that overwrites real space in a way that Valve and Oculus and Sony will never match, but in a bulky, awkward format straight out of a ‘90s X-Files episode. Knapp is aware of these limitations. But even as researchers work to fix them, he’s imagining huge conceptual leaps. One Virginia Tech student, for example, is working on a system that could detect muscle movement and translate it into motion controls — instead of having to look for a gesture, the room would know that you’d flexed to pick up a cup. And unlike Oculus and many others, Knapp doesn’t just want virtual or augmented reality glasses to get smaller. He wants them to disappear altogether. ""The crazy distant future is to shine laser light into the eyes themselves,"" he says, while we’re talking about interfaces. At first, this sounds like a virtual retinal display, the same technology that’s thought to be used in Microsoft’s Hololens and the mysterious Magic Leap headset. In reality, it’s a lot weirder: putting projectors on the walls, not a headset and using sophisticated tracking to beam images directly into your eyes.  ""Just like the aural environment doesn't touch you — you don't have to wear anything to get the aural environment — wouldn't it be neat if you didn't have to do that with the visual environment? Right now we've moved [from a] screen onto commercially available devices like the Oculus,"" or next-generation headsets like Magic Leap. ""But the eventual goal is to move all of that off-body."" Is that the future? A virtual reality theater where speakers are targeted to your precise location and sensors track your muscles, while the walls shine lasers into your eyes? Not for most people. Maybe not for anybody.

The International Energy Agency (IEA) announced that in 2014, the economy grew and CO2 levels didn't. In the past, a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions was due to an economic downturn. That's because economic growth is often linked to increased energy use, which in turn increases emissions. The ""decoupling"" of the economy and carbon emissions was likely the result of efforts by energy companies to fight climate change, the IEA says. Last year, global carbon dioxide emissions reached 32.3 billion metric tons — an amount equal to 2013's levels. During the 40 years the IEA has been collecting data, there have only been three other periods of time when atmospheric CO2 levels did not rise: in the early 1980s, 1992, and 2009. However, these years were also associated with global economic instability, and in 2014, the global economy grew by 3 percent, according to the IEA. ""This gives me even more hope that humankind will be able to work together to combat climate change, the most important threat facing us today,"" IEA chief economist Fatih Birol said in a statement. But atmospheric carbon dioxide levels are still high The shift is due to China's increased use of renewable resources and efforts by countries in the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to promote sustainable forms of energy, according to the IEA. Per-person energy use in the US is also expected to decline as the gross domestic product increases, The Washington Post reports. This doesn't mean the fight against climate change is over. Carbon dioxide levels in the Earth's atmosphere reached record highs in 2013, and greenhouse gas continues to affect rapid and potentially disastrous climate change. Birol notes that the data provides ""much-needed momentum to negotiators preparing to forge a global climate deal"" at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in December.

The craft is composed of two main parts, a servicing vehicle named Jupiter and a cargo container called the Exoliner. What sets Lockheed's plan apart from others' is that it would have Jupiter remain in orbit after the ISS takes its supplies from the Exoliner. While in orbit, it might be able to perform commercial functions — theoretically lowering the cost of each launch for NASA — and then eventually return to the ISS when the next Exoliner filled with cargo is launched. That also means that its Jupiter craft would only need to be sent up once, lowering the cost of successive launches. Lockheed wants to make shipping routes from the Moon to Mars Jupiter and the Exoliner are Lockheed's proposal to NASA for a program meant to resupply the ISS with food and other equipment. SpaceX and Orbital ATK won the first set of contracts for resupplying the station back in 2009, but they only run through 2016. Now a number of companies are competing for the second round of contracts, according to The Washington Post, and NASA is expected to decide on a winner in June. Lockheed, aside from emphasizing that Jupiter and the Exoliner are based on tested hardware, is also trying to establish its proposal as more advanced. It wants to create shipping lanes between the Moon and Mars, according to Aviation Week, and it compares the system in a video to the first railroad to stretch from the United States' east coast to its west coast.   The advanced capabilities that Lockheed points two are, primarily, twofold. First, it says that the system can optionally be used to launch commercial payloads, like satellites. According to Aviation Week, Lockheed's plan would actually share commercial profits with NASA, if the space agency chose to include those payloads. Second, Lockheed says that Jupiter and the Exoliner are designed with the ability to support manned, interplanetary missions in mind. According to the Post, the system is big enough to carry humans and hold equipment needed for extended stays, such as a treadmill. Lockheed suggests that they could be used as the start of remote outposts. Of course, that's beyond the scope of what NASA needs right now, but it certainly sounds cooler.",0.508167955855495,0.491832044144505,0.8856917351137463,403,4.967741935483871,224,5.9241071428571432,0,2,Science

The largest moon in our solar system is hiding an ocean under its surface, according to observations made with the Hubble Space Telescope. Aurorae spotted by the telescope, confirmed the long-standing theory, and the findings were announced during a NASA teleconference this morning. The news comes just a day after we found out that Enceladus, an icy moon of Saturn, likely has hydrothermal activity in its own subsurface ocean. Scientists have speculated since the 1970s that Ganymede could have such an ocean. Until now, though, the only evidence was collected during brief flybys with the Galileo spacecraft in the early 2000s. That left too much ambiguity in the data for NASA scientists to comfortably confirm the ocean's existence. Fairly stable aurorae indicate a massive, salty ocean With Hubble, the scientists were able to collect over seven hours of data; most of that time was spent studying the aurorae seen in the moon's thin atmosphere. An aurora is the colorful result of charged particles interacting with an atmosphere — so just the existence of one doesn't mean there's an ocean. But oceans do change the behavior of aurorae. If there was no ocean on Ganymede, the aurorae would rock back and forth across about six degrees of the moon's circumference as it orbited Jupiter. The presence of a salty, electrically conductive ocean locks the aurorae in a much more stable position: According to the observations, they only move about two degrees. While the Hubble telescope made its observations in the UV spectrum, casting the aurorae in blue, they would actually appear red if you were to stand on the surface of Ganymede.   Ganymede was already interesting before today's news. Not only is it the largest moon in the solar system — it's almost as big as Mars — but it is the only moon in the solar system with its own magnetic field. That field is generated by a molten iron core, much like what we see here on Earth. Its thin atmosphere is also rich in oxygen. Ganymede still isn't a great place to look for life This news doesn't mean that Ganymede should move to the top of the list of places to explore, however. The ocean is likely around 100 miles below the surface, which would make it complicated to study with a robot. Even if a space agency found a way to reach that far down, it's thought that layers of ice separate the ocean from the surface. That means Ganymede is less than ideal for life, because it probably lacks a hydrothermal system like the one thought to exist on Enceladus. Still, the European Space Agency is planning a mission back to the Jupiter system in the 2020s called JUICE. It will take closer looks at the moons of Jupiter like Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto, all three of which are confirmed or thought to have water oceans. ""As far as we can tell, almost everywhere we look there's water,"" Heidi Hammel said during the conference, who is the executive vice president of the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy.

But the outbreak also led to turmoil in those countries' health care systems — and now a measles outbreak is a risk. Should a measles outbreak occur, almost twice as many people will be sickened, compared with before the outbreak. Thousands could die, according to a study appearing in the journal Science today. ""Measles in particular is known to show up during or after humanitarian crises because it’s so infectious,"" says Justin Lessler, a study lead author and an assistant professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, in a call with reporters. ""Measles in particular is known to show up during or after humanitarian crises.""The Ebola crisis kept people away from clinics, for fear of contracting the disease. That means that many children didn't receive vaccines. The researchers created models of vaccination rates in the area. Their main model was that vaccinations had been decreased by 75 percent in West Africa, which was closest to the reports the scientists received as they were working, though they also looked at 25, 50 and 100 percent disruptions. Then they made an 18-month forecast. Before the epidemic, about 778,000 children nine months old to five years old hadn't been vaccinated — about 4 percent of the population. After the epidemic, there will be about 1.1 million children of the same age who are susceptible to measles. If a large outbreak occurs, that means an additional 100,000 cases of measles for a total of 227,000 cases; the extra illnesses are most likely to occur among the youngest children — who are more likely to develop severe complications. An additional 2,000 to 16,000 deaths from measles may occur, the study found. An additional 2,000 to 16,000 deaths from measles may occur Though countries had been engaging in vaccination campaigns or considering them, the Ebola outbreak halted them, says Lessler. Because vaccination campaigns are complex, they require coordination from a lot of health authorities. Those authorities have been preoccupied by Ebola, he says. Though there have been some measles cases reported, no major outbreaks have occurred yet. The paper looked only at the potential for a measles outbreak, but other vaccines — like those against polio, tuberculosis, whooping cough, and tetanus — have also been difficult to deliver during the Ebola outbreak. The researchers focused on measles because they're so contagious that it's one of the first diseases where herd immunity no longer will protect the population, Lessler says.",0.40902733588153306,0.5909726641184669,0.8260511159065828,425,5.2352941176470589,254,6.0275590551181102,0,0,"Policy & Law, Science, US & World"

The first doesn't really sound futuristic at all — it's just a generic Samsung tablet, but the magic is in how tightly BMW's managed to integrate it with the car's systems. The ""Touch Command"" system includes the small Android tablet and a dock in the rear seat, allowing rear passengers to change climate settings, switch radio stations, adjust their seats, and more — in other words, it's basically a portable iDrive controller for when you're getting chauffeured around.  None of this is coming for a year or two The most interesting thing about it is that the tablet is customized by Samsung for BMW: pressing the home button doesn't kick you out to the home screen on a normal Android device, it returns you to Touch Command's main screen. If you want to use the tablet simply as an Android tablet — which you can do — you need to choose the ""Apps"" option inside Touch Command to get kicked out to a launcher. BMW says it hasn't settled on a tablet model or size yet for when Touch Command reaches production, but it'll take a year or two anyway.   Next — and far more interesting to drivers — is a revamped iDrive system that supports touchscreen and gesture control. The touchscreen aspect isn't a big deal (many cars have them), but the gestures are awesome. Using a camera mounted in the car's roof, it looks for one of several gestures made by the driver's right hand like a swipe, a circular motion, or a two-fingered poke in the direction of the screen. All of them can be programmed to one of several functions — for instance, the circular motion can turn volume up and down, and a swipe can reject an incoming call. It's similar to the system Volkswagen showed yesterday on its Golf R Touch, and it seems to be indicative of a new trend in car interfaces — expect to see a lot more of this over the coming years. h2.ces-promo a{  background: #fa4b2a;  border-radius: 3px;  padding: 5px 14px 0px;  font-family: ff-din-web-condensed,Helvetica,sans-serif;  text-transform: uppercase;  font-weight: normal;  font-size: 30px;  text-align:center;  display:inline-block;  margin:0px auto;  color: #fff;}  h2.ces-promo a:hover {      background:#bf2a0d;      color:#fff;      text-decoration:none;    }}",0.5161327354099859,0.48386726459001406,0.19538699623511283,418,4.6100478468899517,239,6.0794979079497908,0,2,"CES 2015, Google, Mobile, Tech, Transportation, Hands-on"

In some of the tests, cars — half of which are emission-free — are available to rent by the minute, which is a bit like Car2Go in some US cities. Additionally, Ford is testing ""dynamic social shuttles"" — think UberPOOL — where registered users can request pickups and drop-offs on demand. In Banglaore, India, another test allows multiple drivers to share a single vehicle, akin to fractional ownership.  An odd fit for a company that makes money selling more cars The programs are a part of the Smart Mobility initiative that Fields announced this morning, a collection of some 25 ""experiments"" Ford is testing around the future of transportation. Supporting ride-sharing systems might seem counterintuitive for a company that survives on selling cars, but Ford's love for systems like this is well-documented: chairman Bill Ford, in particular, has praised Zipcar for ages. In its hometown of Dearborn, Michigan, Ford is also testing something it calls Car Swap — basically an app that helps you find a car that meets your needs. ""The car you own may not fit all of your needs all of the time, such as when you need to haul landscaping material or move a child to college,"" Ford says, so you could use the app to find a bigger vehicle and use it for a while after negotiating a deal with the owner. h2.ces-promo a{  background: #fa4b2a;  border-radius: 3px;  padding: 5px 14px 0px;  font-family: ff-din-web-condensed,Helvetica,sans-serif;  text-transform: uppercase;  font-weight: normal;  font-size: 30px;  text-align:center;  display:inline-block;  margin:0px auto;  color: #fff;}  h2.ces-promo a:hover {      background:#bf2a0d;      color:#fff;      text-decoration:none;    }}",0.6936779147427954,0.3063220852572046,0.841087560832512,335,4.8388059701492541,206,6.2233009708737868,0,0,"CES 2015, Transportation"

But at CES this week, Nvidia isn’t selling LED-embroidered, heatpipe-cooled GPUs; it’s pitching an all-encompassing vision of the future connected car. It doesn’t seem to make sense — and in its full, blooming, overreaching glory, it really doesn’t — but a more tempered, less ambitious version of the plan announced by Nvidia at CES actually makes perfectly good sense. Nvidia is selling the same thing it always has: massive parallel processing Firstly, let’s be clear about what Nvidia is doing. In spite of the deluge of technical jargon and the painfully academic presentation on Sunday, the physical thing that Jen-Hsun Huang held up on the CES stage was still a logic board with chips on it. Nvidia isn’t straying away from its area of expertise. It makes awesomely fast processors that excel at handling multiple tasks in parallel: exactly the sort of brute power required to make a dozen HD video feeds from cameras outside the car and as many high-res displays inside the car work. Nvidia’s pitch technique can certainly be improved, but the company is pursuing the right strategy by essentially manufacturing workloads for the stuff it already makes.   Like any other publicly traded company, the thing Nvidia needs most is growth, which it isn’t going to get from its traditional business of making graphics cards for the PC. There will always be a subset of young people willing to spend outrageous amounts to get the best gaming performance, but their number is unlikely to grow — certainly not at a rate acceptable to investors looking for quick returns. Nvidia lost out to AMD in the battle to provide the graphics chips in the new generation of consoles, it miscalculated by investing heavily in Windows RT, and it’s been muscled out of the smartphone market by Qualcomm’s more integrated and efficient Snapdragon chips. Every effort that Nvidia has made to diversify away from graphics cards and PC gaming has been thwarted by one antagonist or another. There's only one hype train left to ride: cars Without an ultra-efficient mobile processor to put into wearables or a wireless radio to connect up the Internet of Things, there’s only one other hype train for Nvidia to hitch a ride on: cars. Automakers and electronics companies are using the Consumer Electronics Show to announce new alliances, collaborations, and partnerships to help accelerate the pace at which technology moves into the car and smartens up the experience of driving (or, eventually, drives the car itself). Without exception, they are all convinced that cars are primed for a massive upgrade in their situational awareness, automation, and convenience. Nvidia can be the executor of this collective vision, the provider of the brute force required to move us into the future. The new Tegra X1 chip is certainly capable enough for the task. The craziest thing here is Nvidia's ambition Nvidia’s misstep is in trying to convince companies that it can provide the software as well as the hardware required for smartening up the car. The company is pushing for the use of deep neural networking — a sophisticated, but extremely computationally intensive form of machine learning — to compile a shared dataset among all cars with its Drive PX platform and thereby smarten them up through a sort of hive-mind operation facilitated by over-the-air software updates. If that sounds extravagantly ambitious, that’s because it is. You can have faith in Nvidia delivering raw computational power, but what’s the basis for trusting this company to come up with the proper framework for harnessing that power and revolutionizing driving as we know it? And even if Nvidia could pull it off, it'd still clash with the reluctance of car companies that would prefer to be in charge of the software running on their cars.  Converting companies like Audi from fans into buyers will be the biggest challenge Notably absent from Audi’s endorsement of Nvidia’s technology at CES was any announcement of Audi actually buying the products and services Nvidia’s advertising. It wouldn’t be a problem for Nvidia that its CES event has been panned as overly technical if it helps the company reach its intended audience of half a dozen executives. The chief technology officers of Toyota, Daimler, General Motors, and the Volkswagen and Fiat groups are the ones that Nvidia was truly speaking to on Sunday. It’s not hugely surprising that they haven’t responded by opening up their considerable wallets and embracing Nvidia’s vision: each of those conglomerates and each of their individual car brands already have smart car initiatives under way.   There is definitely an Nvidia-shaped niche in the market for future car technology. Automakers at CES aren’t in universal agreement yet, but most are looking at cameras as the main way to add environmental awareness to a car (as opposed to LIDAR, for example), and Sony’s also pushing the same message in its effort to sell more imaging sensors. Someone needs to do all the heavy lifting of processing those pixels and Nvidia’s proven it has the muscle for the job. If Nvidia finds the humility to limit its role in the connected car to that of a powerful but dumb computation engine, it may well find the automotive success it's looking for. h2.ces-promo a{  background: #fa4b2a;  border-radius: 3px;  padding: 5px 14px 0px;  font-family: ff-din-web-condensed,Helvetica,sans-serif;  text-transform: uppercase;  font-weight: normal;  font-size: 30px;  text-align:center;  display:inline-block;  margin:0px auto;  color: #fff;}  h2.ces-promo a:hover {      background:#bf2a0d;      color:#fff;      text-decoration:none;    }}",0.5453037530493148,0.4546962469506852,0.18372336618930973,990,5.0757575757575761,519,6.7013487475915223,0,4,"CES 2015, Tech, Transportation, Report"

Van Cleef & Arpel have debuted a gorgeous new astronomical watch, the 44mm Midnight Planétarium, at Geneva's annual Salon International de la Haute Horlogerie. The watch shows both numerical time and the rotation of five planets — Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn — visible from Earth. Each planet is represented by precious and semi-precious stones, which rotate around the sun (a stone in the center) in the amount of time it takes for the actual planet to make a rotation. You'll easily be able to see a full rotation of Mercury every 88 days and Venus every 224 days, but it'll take a while to see a full rotation of Saturn — 29 years to be exact. The watch makes telling regular time easy and whimsical, using a shooting star on the outermost area of the face. In addition to the rotating planets, the ""Lucky Day"" feature adds another layer of luxury and fancy: use the bezel to select any special day of the year to be your Lucky Day, and the Earth will fall underneath the painted star on the watch's crystal on that day every year.  It will take years to see every planet complete one rotation Midnight Planétarium is a testament to Van Cleef & Arpel's legacy of making watches with stunning, playful displays, as well as Dutch boutique designer Christiaan van der Klaauw's astronomic prowess. Van Cleef's master watchmaker Denis Giguet told Cool Hunting that the biggest challenge was making the planets rotate correctly, and doing it in such a small, thin frame. Van der Klaauw's expertise in astronomic design made him a wise partner for the company, which wanted a special watch to add to its Poetic Astronomy series. While it looks like a fanciful tool out of Harry Potter's world, the watch is a kind of ridiculous beauty that warrants the $245,000 price tag, and that will be striking every time someone looks at it.

More than one, in fact. In Washington, DC, and Marina Del Rey, CA, two parallel laboratories are using virtual reality headsets to help the Navy dream up the next generation of interfaces. With them, future war-fighters could drive a ship with full three-dimensional awareness of their surroundings, or repair high-tech ship parts while collaborating with their designer in real-time, thousands of miles away. But BlueShark, a joint initiative between the Swampworks division of the Office of Naval Research and the USC Institute for Creative Technologies, isn't actually about virtual reality per se. According to Mark Bolas, one of the USC project directors, VR is the place where the Navy can reach out and touch user interfaces which might not be practical to build this decade, let alone this year, because technologies like holographic displays and augmented reality windows don't yet exist at scale. ""But we can mock them all up in the head-mounted display,"" says Bolas. In the picture above, according to the Office of Naval Research, a Marine is directing a virtual UAV to fly over a point of interest while gazing into the Rift and using a real touchscreen display. But that's just one user interface, one possible use for the technology dreamed up so far. ""The Navy's really using it to figure out what the future sailor is going to expect in 15 years,"" Bolas tells The Verge.   Photo above: John F.

A few years later, the Ryno is now a reality, and since it’s street legal, we took one for a spin on the streets of Brooklyn. The Ryno uses gyroscopes and accelerometers to balance and drive. I’ve tried to learn how to ride a motorcycle before, and I found the Ryno easier and more intuitive. You sit down, lean into it, and you’re off. Getting comfortable takes a little while, and tight turning was too advanced for my 20-minute lesson, but I was still able to have fun zipping back and forth on my motorized unicycle.   A beautiful, slightly impractical machine You can ride the Ryno sitting down, but it's easier if you hop up and stand on the foot pegs. Avoiding obstacles by drifting left and right was accomplished by simply looking where you wanted to go, aligning your shoulders in that direction, and letting the Ryno do the rest. There is a hand brake to help you stop but I never had to use it. Leaning back slowed me down and I could simply put my feet on the ground when I was ready for a full stop. The Ryno is a beautiful machine, with the slick lines and vigorously mechanical look of a sports car or high-performance motorcycle. While it is street legal, the Ryno's top speed is capped at 10 miles an hour and it only has a range of 10 miles on a full battery. Hoffman says the bike could easily go much faster, but 10 miles an hour was the best balance of speed and safety. Still, it could work for some urban commuters. Unfortunately, the Ryno itself weighs about 160 pounds, meaning you won't want to cart it up and down any stairs. And with a price tag of over five grand, it’s significantly more expensive than the comparable electric vehicles with equal or better range and speed that we saw at this year’s CES. But that's not really the point. The Ryno seems like the kind of thing you would splurge on if style was your thing. It’s definitely alluring. While we were testing it, a half-dozen people stopped by to gawk, take pictures, and ask about the bike. The company says it has more preorders than it can handle. ""We have a lot of interest from police departments, airports, and security guards looking to cover a lot of space on a daily basis,"" says Hoffman. Riding it is a unique and enjoyable experience, one I’m sure would get better with a little more time spent learning how to operate it. It’s not the most practical or economical electric vehicle I’ve been on recently, but it's not trying to be. The Ryno is more about taking a crazy dream and making it come to life.

Due to the passing of a relative I skipped the journey to Vegas and stayed back in London, tasked with keeping the site ticking overnight while my colleagues got some well-deserved sleep. At 6AM on the first morning of the week, I attached Durr to my wrist, activated vibrations, and got to work. Within seconds of starting my shift, big news broke from Google. After reading through various press releases and researching the history, I set to work writing the article. Just two sentences in, I felt my watch vibrate and instinctively looked down to my wrist, expecting to see a pixelated notification on a monochrome Pebble display. Then I remembered Durr isn't like other watches. It doesn't tell the time, it doesn't give me notifications, it just vibrates every five minutes. As I put the finishing touches on the article and prepared to post it to the site, Durr vibrated again, reminding me just how long this was taking. What seemed like a two- or three-minute writeup had actually taken twelve. This was my introduction to Durr. If I proposed building a watch that doesn't tell the time, you'd probably call me crazy. But that's exactly what two designers known collectively as Skrekkøgle have done. Durr doesn't want to tell you what time it is — it doesn’t even have a display to do so. It simply measures the time between moments by vibrating. I've been wearing one on a daily basis for almost a month now, and my time with it has been enlightening.  I ordered Durr on a whim; at €90 (about $120), it’s just about within my range for an impulse buy. I was intrigued by the concept, and have something of a passion for odd watches. Wearing it for the first time, I noted it resembled something like a giant Necco wafer strapped to my wrist, a handmade polyamide circle with a simple brown leather strap. It comes in five fairly agreeable colors — the hue of my particular Durr is called ""cooked salmon,"" which is one of the better euphemisms for pink I've come across — and has no controls apart from a tiny recessed button on the side that turns vibrations on and off. I wouldn't say it's attractive or unattractive, but its looks are definitely an acquired taste. Towards the end of CES week I attended a funeral that was conducted almost entirely in Greek  — a language I don’t speak — and permeated with incense and all manner of Orthodox chanting. I was there to pay my respects and say goodbye, but a combination of faint-inducing incense and general sleep deprivation had turned this gesture into a battle to maintain consciousness. Once again, Durr quietly vibrated away, letting me know that each six hours that passed had in fact been just five minutes. As the days passed, Durr's vibration began to fade into the background, and I started to use it to my advantage. I’ve since found it makes me more productive than any smartwatch ever has. While Pebble distracts me with its incessant buzzing, Durr calls me out when I'm taking too long making a GIF, it lets me know when that article probably should've been up two minutes ago, and, as I write this review, it's telling me that browsing lists on BuzzFeed is definitely not going to help me finish this paragraph. That's been the theme of my month with Durr: how I perceive and make use of my time is invariably wrong. I spoke with Durr’s creators, Theo Tveterås and Lars Vedeler, about my experience, and while it wasn’t quite what they had in mind when designing Durr, they admit that its purpose is ambiguous at best. To Tvertås and Vedeler, Durr was simply an experiment. After a conversation about how quickly a busy day at the office had flown by, they wondered if there was a simple way they could keep track of time. In half an hour, they'd created a clunky prototype, and were enthralled enough by their wrist-worn metronome to pursue the idea further. Speaking with them, I get the impression that they're very happy for people to interpret its vibrations in whatever way they want. This initial run, which sold out in a little over six weeks, has garnered conflicting opinions from buyers and observers alike. Apparently, some have given the designers feedback similar to mine, reporting increased productivity. An alternate interpretation is that Durr serves as a memento mori, a friendly vibrating reminder that your death is now five minutes closer. A friendly vibrating reminder that your death is now five minutes closer  That Durr presents very little reason for its existence has drawn criticism from some — its makers refer to scrolling through online comments as ""psychological self-mutilation."" But if its obtuse simplicity has provoked some unwanted negativity, reaction to its price has at times been vitriolic. The initial run was priced at €90 (around $120), which in the world of limited-run watches is fairly low, but some commenters compared it to ""an egg timer on a strap"" and called out the designers for overpricing what is admittedly a simple piece of electronics. Tvetarås and Vedeler defend the price, noting that most consumers are used to mass-produced electronics. ""At our level of low volume and scale everything is more expensive,"" says Tvetarås. ""We're not making much money out of this."" Although they don't mention it, there’s also the small matter of location: the watch was designed and made in Oslo, Norway. It’s perhaps the most expensive city in the world, a place where a Big Mac costs $7.80 and a pair of Levi’s 501s will set you back $150. To me, I bought an alpha product made by a pair of designers with no outside funding. Yes it’s expensive, but at this stage in development it shouldn’t be judged against other products.  Image credit: Skrekkøgle Despite initially refusing to commit to making more, the pair are now planning on expanding production to a beta run. The initial alpha units were constructed on a small scale, pieced together and dyed by hand. The new Durrs are being redesigned to enable a larger production scale, hopefully resulting in a reduced price. Tveterās also says they're working on a new vibration scheme to get past the way people are ""hardwired"" to associate vibrations with smartphones. I’m looking forward to recommending it to procrastinating friends. As much as I reap the benefits of my new watchless watch, I do miss being able to glance at my wrist and tell the time. I’m not convinced that adding a small and relatively inexpensive LCD unit to tell the time would take away from the watch’s appeal. That said, no watch, smart or otherwise, has given me this much insight into how uselessly unproductive I can be sometimes, and I have Durr to thank for that.",0.3788468326045462,0.6211531673954538,0.2005326787911491,1169,4.7869974337040206,624,6.2115384615384617,0,0,

His comic struggle was celebrated by Ian Frazier's 1990 New Yorker fiction piece, ""Coyote v. Acme,"" which dramatized the opening statements of the almost-inevitable lawsuit between the two parties. Now the prolific design firm Pentagram is taking a deeper dive into the invented lawsuit with a close look at some of the peculiar products sold to the Coyote. One of Pentagram's designers, Daniel Weil, has created a series of technical drawings for Acme products that may just be included in such a suit as supporting evidence. Weil details a rocket sled, rocket skates, spring-powered shoes, a bomb, and a tiger trap, all of which Pentagram says are designed carefully enough that they should functionally work — even if you may want to be wary of using them. The cartoons might imply that there's some matter of fault from both parties, but with Weil's designs in hand, it may become more evident which party takes the bulk of it.

Contrary to earlier rumors, it's much more than just a news-reading app — it's a complete reimagining of Facebook itself. Once you've used it, you may never want to open the standard Facebook app again. It may not replicated every feature of Facebook's main app, but it does fulfill the majority of people's needs. Simply put, it's much, much better. Paper takes the standard Facebook News Feed and recreates it as an immersive, horizontally scrolling set of screens. It also provides a new way to post to Facebook (and Paper) with an elegant WYSIWYG editor that borrows the styling of Medium's and Svbltle's blogging systems. Finally, yes, it's a news-reading app that owes some of its looks to Flipboard. It will be available for the iPhone in the US (and only the iPhone in the US) on February 3rd. It's also ad-free, at least for now.  That's all more than we were expecting when we sat down with product designer Mike Matas and product manager Michael Reckhow. Neither would quite take the bait when asked whether this should serve as a replacement for the original Facebook app (or, as I put it during our interview, a virtual indictment). Reckhow says that there are ""tools that were out there for sharing high-quality stuff and also the tools where you could reach an audience,"" but that too often they aren't the same thing. ""We felt you shouldn't have to choose between one or the other,"" he says. Goodbye buttons, hello swipes Paper cuts away virtually all buttons and other UI elements to make every status update, photo, and news story appear full-screen. To get around, you will need to learn a basic set of gestures, but the app will gently remind you what they are if it thinks you're stuck. Wide photos pan as you tilt the phone (the team cheekily calls it the ""Ken turns"" effect), UI elements often just fade away, and news stories are presented in Twitter-esque cards. The lack of chrome to help place you in the app and tell you how to navigate can be a little disorienting. On the bright side, the UI is fast and fluid, thanks to the nine months the team has spent working on the app. Loren Brichter, the creator of Letterpress and Tweetie, also chipped in on the coding. The result is an app that shares a family resemblance to Facebook Home on Android, but is much faster and more full-featured.  Each section in Paper has a main screen with a cover photo and a list of small cards at the bottom. You can scroll through or drill into the cards, at which point you'll be swiping through one card at a time. Matas hopes that you'll flip through slowly. ""You really want people to spend a little bit of time with it and appreciate that content,"" Matas says, ""almost like when you go to a museum and you spend a little bit of time with each thing."" A lean-back experience, but on a tiny screen If you aren't put off by the idea of considering a photo of your friend's dog an art piece, you might call it a lean-back experience (albeit on a tiny screen). As a UI philosophy, this stands in direct opposition to the high-volume, high-noise vertical feeds we're used to on Twitter and  Facebook. It definitely means it will take longer to grind through content like you can on Twitter — but for Facebook, that's exactly the point. If, like me, you're a news addict and an information fiend, Paper may be a little too relaxed for you. The interface for news reading is exactly the same, with the exception that links are automatically turned into small, Twitter-esque media cards with branding from the publication. Swiping up to read the full story takes you to the source site — there's no offline mode like you might find in a more full featured news app. You also can't add any site you want, as with a traditional RSS reader. Instead, Facebook has hired a team of content curators to pick stories for you in one of a dozen or so categories ranging from basic news to cute animals. You can post to Paper (and thus Facebook) in a new kind of compose screen. It shows you exactly what the final post will look like, and Reckhow isn't shy about his hope that people will think of Paper as a new kind of thing — even though the plumbing underneath is still Facebook. ""Think about when Instagram came out and you now had this new way to share,"" he says. Facebook’s ambition with Paper is to have it become its own thing, not just a different way of accessing Facebook. Matas goes so far as to say that ""it’s a publishing tool, a way of publishing great content, and a way of viewing great content.""  Paper is the first product to come out of Facebook Creative Labs, a unit within the company tasked to ""innovate and build new things,"" as Reckhow puts it. That's likely a sign that Paper will be just one of what CEO Mark Zuckerberg called ""new and engaging types of mobile experiences"" on yesterday’s earnings call. Since its embarrassing Snapchat clone called Poke failed, Facebook seems closer to figuring out the right formula for its single-use apps. Facebook knows that mobile users are gravitating towards such apps, and it intends to create more of them. Facebook wants another spot on your home screen, and another one after that That’s probably a good thing, and perhaps a necessary one. From a user's perspective, Facebook’s current app is beset by dozens of options, nooks, crannies, and features that most people don’t really use. The recent ""tab-centric"" redesign helped simplify things, but it wasn’t radical change. Facebook has a billion users, and so any alterations it wants to make to its core app need to be tested — extensively. That kind of testing can get in the way of creative design. ""You can’t be innovative if you’re encumbered by worrying if you’re going to disrupt what hundreds of millions or a billion people are doing,"" Reckhow says. The team wanted ""to have the creative freedom to go outside of what we’ve done and not worry about if it’s going to impact metrics [on] day one."" For Reckhow, Matas, and the rest of the team, Paper is less a replacement for Facebook’s app than a chance for the company to try out something very different from what it’s done before — and get another icon on your iPhone’s home screen in the process. If Paper does score a slot on your main home screen, another app will probably have to be buried away somewhere else. For a lot of people, Facebook itself will be a prime candidate.",0.6425088026219862,0.3574911973780138,0.16133759478996837,1155,4.6138528138528141,577,5.861351819757366,0,0,"Apps, Design, Tech, Web, Report"

The list of objects this will work with is virtually endless, with a video launching the Kickstarter campaign showing Ototo connected to all manner of fruits, vegetables, and household objects.   Ototo's synthesizer has a number of different sounds that you can choose between, as well as granular control over pitch, loudness, and texture. The basic kit is priced at £45 ($75), but there are a number of sensors and attachments that can extend Ototo's capabilities beyond simple touch controls.

The S5 is said to have sold 12 million units in its first three months on sale; roughly 4 million fewer than its predecessor and overall around 40 percent fewer than projected. Sales were said to be down over 50 percent in China, with the US as the only major market where sales actually increased. The US is, however, Samsung's biggest market.  Galaxy sales said to increase in USA, but nowhere else Samsung reportedly overestimated how much stock would be needed, leading to an increased advertising spend to get rid of units that were ""piling up in warehouses.""  Last month the company promised to ""fundamentally reform"" its smartphone portfolio after reporting plummeting profits and revenue. The Journal also cites sources that believe Samsung is considering making some changes at the executive level — with mobile chief co-CEO JK Shin possibly ceding his role to fellow co-CEO in charge of TVs and appliances — but these rumors are cagier, and the plans are said to be far from final. Any management shake-up would come as Samsung faces frenzied speculation over the company's top level of leadership. Chairman Lee Kun-hee, the man who orchestrated Samsung's meteoric rise in the '90s and beyond, has been seriously ill after suffering a heart attack in May and, while his son Jay Y.

Outside of the world of computer science, however, these strategies are still relatively niche. A San Francisco startup called Assembly is trying to change all that, by evolving the open-source model to easily incorporate disciplines outside coding and to include a shared profit motive as well. Today the company is announcing a $2.9 million round of funding it will use to help expand its platform. When David Kaneda, a user experience designer at Google, set about creating his side project, Buckets, he struggled to bring in a lot of the talent he needed. ""Before finding Assembly, I was disappointed that there was no way to provide a financial reward within the Open Source ecosystem."" Using the service, he was able to set rewards for different tasks and distribute them onto the web where anyone who felt they were right for the job could pick it up. ""Assembly not only provides additional incentive for contributions, but also allows for more types of contributions—whether marketing, design, planning or research.""  With Assembly, a part-time entrepreneur like Kaneda can open source any number of tasks he might need for his business: designing a new logo, creating an email marketing campaign, and researching the best cloud-hosting solution, for example. Since the business doesn't have outside funding or stock options, Assembly lets him set the reward as a percentage of future earnings and handles the work of dividing and distributing that revenue stream. ""I think Assembly is the next step for the open source movement."" In that way, Assembly is similar to companies like New York's Quirky, which crowdsources innovation by allowing a large group of people from across different disciplines to contribute to the creation of a single new product. Like Quirky, the strength of Assembly will come from its community, which currently includes designers, engineers, marketers, and even lawyers. These folks might contribute to a half dozen different projects, all remotely, based on what draws their interest. ""I think Assembly is the next step for the open source movement. Instead of contributing to just software and getting better and free software in return, people can now contribute to an entire company,"" wrote Wesley Lancel, a developer from Belgium, who has contributed to a number of projects on Assembly. ""It's not just contributing code, but also setting the direction and strategy of an actual company and helping out to make that company a success. And in return you don't just get better software or people using your code, but a real share in a company."" Leveraging blockchain technology from the Bitcoin world Assembly is leveraging technology from the world of Bitcoin to help create a shared ownership structure for each product. ""App Coins (the ownership in a product on the blockchain) is not equity in the traditional company sense,"" explained Assembly founder Matthew Deiters. ""They can't be transferred or sold. Instead they are used to determine an individual’s monthly earnings as well as verifiable ownership control used in voting decisions."" Each project has a core team the brings the original idea to the Assembly platform. That team decides what tasks need to be done and how many App Coins they are worth. Anyone can contribute towards that work without permission, the model borrowed from open source, and just like many big open source projects, the core team approves or declines the final work. Assembly serves as the platform for all this and also a financial and legal steward. ""Technically these aren't companies. They aren't independent entities but instead a collective of people that built a software product on Assembly,"" Deiters wrote via email. ""We also just handle what's necessary so they can operate as a distributed business (e.g. taxes, finances, etc). I like to think of them as a partnership since each contributor has a seat at the table, can help where they are best, and have access to all the operating information."" Bringing the open-source ethos to a broader set of opportunities Assembly was founded in 2013 and says that so far it has launched five software projects that have been used by more than four million people. There are currently more than 50 projects in development on the platform. Of course, just two of the four products launched so far are profitable, so the incentive for people to contribute still has a ways to go before it reaches something like critical mass. ""Open-source software has unleashed a flurry of decentralized, emergent, bottom-up innovation. That's been great for software engineers, but until now, there has been no good way for developers to collaborate with designers, product managers, marketers, or sales people,"" says Brad Burnham, a tech investor with Union Square Ventures who participated in Assembly's funding round. ""By supporting that richer collaboration, Assembly brings the ethos of open-source software to a much broader set of opportunities.""",0.8894584566066113,0.11054154339338873,0.8473014931803479,855,5.1847953216374272,454,6.3700440528634363,0,0,"Business, Tech, Report"

Slack Plus, as the tier is called, will offer a handful of new tools aimed at system administrators. But there’s one feature every Slack user needs to know about: companies that subscribe to the Plus plan will be able to request every message that employees have sent on the service from that point forward, including direct messages to coworkers and a history of any changes you made to your messages. Slack has revised its privacy policy to accommodate the new feature, which it says was requested by businesses that are legally obligated to retain employee communications. (The revisions are worth reading for anyone who manages a Slack team; among other things, it now requires you to waive your right to a jury trial in favor of binding arbitration if you ever have reason to sue the company.) Slack now has 300,000 daily users on 40,000 teams Every enterprise software startup eventually courts big companies, which generally have the most money to spend. But few have done it as quickly as Slack, which launched in February and now has 300,000 daily users on 40,000 teams. Its earliest users were small teams, but Slack is now used at Amazon, Walmart, AOL, and ESPN, among other places. (Also: The Verge.) But large enterprises, particularly in highly regulated industries like banking and finance, generally won’t buy cloud software unless it meets a long list of criteria. Some industries require companies to store all employee communications, including emails and instant messages, in case of future litigation. For those companies to use Slack, Slack had to build a way for them to access employee messages.   For many of us, the idea of a boss (or a federal court) reading all our old chats with co-workers can send a shiver down the spine. Slack knows this, and the system it built tries to balance your expectations of privacy with the fact that, legally, employers do own your workplace communication. Slack won’t offer a ""god mode"" view of the service that lets a boss snoop on your conversations in real time — but it will let team owners request the entire archive of your team’s conversations. So here’s how it works. First, none of the messages you’ve sent on Slack to date fall under the new policy; the company will only start tracking them on Jan. 1st. Second, ""compliance exports,"" as the new feature is known, is available only to teams that pay for the new tier of service that will become available in January. And third, exports aren’t available by default — companies have to jump through a series of hoops to request them, including sending a snail-mail letter on company letterhead requesting access. ""It’s like having a waiting period before you buy a gun,"" says Stewart Butterfield, Slack’s founder and CEO. ""It's like having a waiting period before you buy a gun."" If your boss does request compliance exports, you’ll be notified within Slack when it happens. Your boss can’t request chat logs for individuals; the export is a single bulk file of every communication sent on the team. ""We’re being up front with users when this feature is enabled, which isn’t always the case with all the communication tools you use in a work place,"" says Anne Toth, Slack’s vice president for policy and compliance strategy. I asked Butterfield for a recommendation on which software I should use to safely complain about my boss; he laughed and declined to offer a suggestion. But he says he expects only a small fraction of Slack teams will request compliance exports. Toth joined the company seven weeks ago; its number of users has grown 50 percent since then. ""Slack creates essentially a virtual water cooler for a lot of distributed workspaces,"" she says. ""In the real world, you know if your boss was standing there behind you. We’re helping people be thoughtful about the communications they’re having, by giving them information about who’s able to access those conversations.""",0.6246719517809114,0.3753280482190886,0.8612815148665973,695,4.9798561151079133,383,6.0182767624020892,0,2,"Apps, Business, Tech, Report"

The law, passed Thursday evening, takes aim at ""pro-anorexia"" websites that promote ""thinspiration"" to young girls and women, saying they push people to ""excessive thinness."" An amendment passed Friday morning prohibits fashion agencies from hiring underweight and malnourished models. The laws were passed by France's National Assembly as an amendment to a broader public health bill. The French health ministry says that between 30,000 and 40,000 people suffer from anorexia in France, 90 percent of whom are women. Glorification or support group?  The fashion industry has been at the center of much of the debate. Last month, lawmakers proposed a bill that would ban excessively thin models and fine agencies that hire them. The measure was rejected on the grounds that it would violate anti-discrimination laws, but an amended version was passed Friday morning. Under the law, agencies or fashion houses that hire models with a body mass index (BMI) under 18 can face up to six months in prison and a €75,000 ($86,100) fine. Italy, Spain, and Israel have adopted similar regulations. Supporters of the law passed Thursday say these ""pro-ana"" websites and forums endanger public health because they promote ""prolonged dietary restrictions"" and glorify unhealthy aesthetics such as ""thigh gaps"" and exposed rib cages. The measure is necessary, they argue, because authorities currently have no legal recourse to regulate the sites, but others say it may prove counterproductive. A 2013 report from France's national scientific research center and other organizations warned that not all pro-ana or ""pro-mia"" (pro-bulimia) websites actually encourage eating disorders, saying some offer an important outlet for people to discuss their struggles. It also says censoring the sites would be ""ineffective,"" noting that previous crackdowns from online services like Yahoo weren't able to prevent duplicates from popping up. But Olivier Véran, a socialist MP and neurologist who sponsored the amendment, said yesterday that it wouldn't jeopardize online free speech, adding that it carefully differentiates sites that are ""sometimes run by young women who use it as an outlet"" from those that clearly support ""methods to lose as much weight as possible."" The public health amendments will go on to the Senate for a vote.

Culture secretary Sajid Javid said an independent regulator would work with websites to verify users' ages using as-yet-unspecified methods. Sites that fail to comply would be blocked by the UK's internet service providers (ISPs) while ISPs that did not co-operate could be fined. Although the plans have been welcomed by child welfare charities, experts have warned that mandatory age-checks could be costly and difficult to implement. Some commentators have suggested that the proposals could also lead to greater censorship of the internet in the UK. The new plans have been unfavorably compared with the 2013 opt-out internet filters, which were introduced to help families control access to adult material but inadvertently blocked educational resources such as sexual health websites. The conservatives say internet users are always ""two clicks away"" from online porn In a post on the party's Facebook page, the Conservatives say that on the internet, ""anyone, regardless of their age, is only ever two clicks away"" from pornographic material. ""Of course adults should be perfectly free to look at these sites,"" said the post. ""But if websites showing adult content don’t have proper age controls in place – ones that will stop children looking at this kind of material — they should and will be blocked altogether."" traditional date of birth age checks are useless At the moment, it's uncertain how a UK-wide age-check would be implemented. Traditional age checks asking users to enter their date of birth are a byword for ineffectiveness, and although the Conservatives have suggested that credit card checks could be used, even this method might be insecure. To bypass such age checks, children can simply borrow or steal the relevant data from parents or older friends. Electronic IDs could also be used, but these system require a great amount of time and money to set up. There might also be concerns over the type of data that could be recorded by an independent regulator. Speaking to Buzzfeed UK, Gilad Rosner, a privacy and digital identity researcher, said that ""the ideal solution is one that is good at proving age but hides the porn preferences of the user."" Rosner added that the plan was ""technologically feasible, [but] would cost a lot."" plans introduced after scare survey published The promises to introduce mandatory age-checks were made this weekend after a press release published last week by Childline claimed that a tenth of 12- to 13-year-olds were worried they were addicted to pornography. However, this research has been criticized, with publications including Vice noting that the survey quoted by numerous outlets including BBC News had been conducted by OnePoll, a ""creative market research group"" that pays users to fill out online questionnaires before selling the resulting research to PR firms. However, despite the suspect nature of this research, many UK groups say there's no escaping the fact that thanks to the internet, pornography is more accessible for young people than ever before. ""The easy availability to children of online pornography, much of it extreme, violent and profoundly degrading, is of deepening concern,"" said the head of UK child protection charity NSPCC. ""Any action that makes it more difficult for young people to find this material is to be welcomed.""",0.6666416198193903,0.3333583801806097,0.6247611338193649,553,5.2730560578661843,329,6.2006079027355625,0,0,"Culture, Policy & Law, US & World, Web"

On Tuesday, one of the pizzeria's co-owners told a local news affiliate that ""[i]f a gay couple came in and wanted us to provide pizzas for their wedding, we would have to say no."" Memories Pizza said they would continue to serve gay customers that came into their store. The remarks came after Republican Governor Mike Pence signed a controversial ""religious freedom"" law that critics said could be used by businesses to justify discrimination against gay or transgender customers. Yesterday, amid widespread boycott threats and condemnation from public figures, Pence approved a clarification to the bill that explicitly prohibits businesses from denying employment or service based on an individual's sexual orientation or gender identity. The GoFundMe page was set up by Lawrence Jones, a contributor to a show on Glenn Beck's The Blaze TV network, ""to relieve the financial loss endured by the proprietors’ stand for faith.""

A huge set of trailers came out over the weekend during Comic-Con, all of which you can — and should — check out at our post-Comic-Con roundup if you're interested in seeing the biggest of the big. But there were still some interesting trailers making their way out this week, including a major trio from Comic-Con. You can check out nine of this week's best below.   Opinions seem to be pretty split on whether this first look at Suicide Squad is awful or amazing, so let's break it down a bit using what we can safely accept as an accurate measurement of its success: my own opinion. Winner: Margot Robbie. With just a few brief flashes, Robbie, who plays Harley Quinn, shows that she has more of an idea of what's going on in this movie than anyone else. She's all at once wild, calm, and deeply intriguing. Basically, she's got Quinn down. Loser: Everyone eating dinner at the beginning of the trailer. This is, perhaps, a necessary bit of exposition, but it really, really feels like they're just explaining things for the audience. Let's hope it doesn't stand out that much in the movie. Winner: Jared Leto. We were all prepared to hate his take on the Joker. This trailer may not win everyone over, but it at least starts moving us in the other direction. Undecided: Will Smith. He's playing Will Smith, the hero, despite being a villain. Maybe that's what we want from him — but can it work here? Also, he says the name of the movie out loud. Winner: Whoever cut this trailer. Yeah, I kind of love it. It's the music and the wonderful pacing in the backend. It works, even if I have serious doubts about the movie itself. The film comes out next year on August 5th.   What I've been loving about the Fantastic Four trailers is that they make the movie seem like it cares about the Fantastic Four as people, not just as heroes. That may break down a bit as this trailer goes on, but there's still enough to drawn me in. Here's hoping that pans out. The film will be released on August 7th.   There's a lot about prophesies and destiny and story tales in the latest Pan trailer, none of which is really what's making it interesting. The film is trying to sell itself as a swashbuckling adventure, and if it can actually pull that off, it'd be pretty magical and a ton of fun. It'll be out October 9th.   David O. Russell is back with another movie starring Jennifer Lawrence. What's Joy about? Kind of everything. This trailer zooms through Lawrence's character's life, from childhood to adulthood, and that seems like it could be wonderful. It's out December 25.   The creator of The Wire and the director of Crash have come together to make Show Me a Hero, an HBO miniseries about a mayor of Yonkers, NY who tried to tear down racist housing policies. It's an important subject, and everything we've heard so far suggests it'll be a good series. Oscar Isaac stars, and wonderful actors including Catherine Keener and Alfred Molina fill out the cast. It begins on August 16th.   Here's all that matters about Sisters: it's a comedy, and Tina Fey and Amy Poehler play the titular sisters. Enjoy. It's out December 18th.   Netflix has rolled out another ridiculous promo for Wet Hot American Summer: First Day of Camp. It's not the funniest thing we've seen from the new miniseries, but who cares? We're just excited to see this cast back together again. It premieres on Netflix at the end of the month, on July 31st.   Nextlix's next series is about Pablo Escobar and the law enforcement officers trying to nab him (as well as other small-time drug offenders). With Pablo Escobar as one of its central characters, Narcos seems like it could have a grand story to tell. Someone please binge watch this when it comes out on August 28th and let us know how it goes.   AMC's next series is basically a gritty fairy tale with a ton of martial arts. That's a pretty great place to come from, but whether it can actually pull that off is something this trailer doesn't speak to in an entirely positive way. Still, it's unlike most else on TV, and that's enough to make it interesting. It starts in November.",0.5189666443812433,0.4810333556187567,0.1473708276177412,775,4.4412903225806453,441,5.4104308390022675,0,0,"Culture, Entertainment, Film"

XCOM 2 starts out by assuming that you failed.  It’s the sequel to 2012’s XCOM: Enemy Unknown, which rebooted the long-running series, bringing its brand of sci-fi strategy to a brand new audience. But the premise this time is that humanity failed in its attempt to defeat the alien invaders, and two decades later we’re now fighting to free the planet from alien rule.  This shift means a new look for the series, with human cities that are now overrun with alien creatures and technology, including new species like the Viper, essentially a giant humanoid snake. In a shift from the previous game, XCOM 2 also features procedurally generated maps, so that missions are slightly different each time you play. So how do you go about envisioning a future where invading aliens have spent 20 years inhabiting human cities?  We spoke to XCOM 2 art director Greg Foertsch to find out.  Andrew Webster: The series obviously has a very strong visual legacy. When you’re approaching a new game, what are some of the key factors for ensuring it’s recognizably XCOM? Greg Foertsch: The consistent theme is that XCOM has always been rooted in UFO lore. We look for iconic elements of that lore that are familiar to players and use them as our starting point. Everyone has an idea of little gray aliens with almond eyes, and we’ve built on that to create the Sectoid in the XCOM universe. It’s no accident that it is always the first alien the player encounters, because almost everyone can relate to this type of alien. We try to work within that established visual language but giving things a new and interesting twist. This is a great way to acclimate the player to the universe and enables us to take more liberties visually, as the game progresses. The real challenge is trying to make something familiar, but something that no one has ever seen at the same time. What do you think is the biggest visual change for this entry? Without a doubt the biggest visual change is the increase in visual fidelity across the board. Not only are the textures and materials richer, but there is more fidelity in the models, animations, and effects as well. We want to keep pushing the player’s immersion in the game world. When designing the new cities, where do you look for inspiration / research? What was the tone or feeling you were trying to create with the new locations? We looked a lot at modern cities with simple, clean, and elegant styles. There is an economy to their design that we wanted to tap into. Additionally, this style has a very modular look which lends itself to our level construction process. City Centers are alien-created megacities, and we really wanted to create spaces that resonated with people, but felt almost unnaturally clean. Everything is so perfect that it should feel too good to be true, which really helps us to create contrast with the other environments the player will encounter in the game. How do you use the environment to help tell the story and convey how life has changed after humanity lost? In what ways have things changed visually over the two decades between games? Each space is crafted in such a way that it has its own personality and history. Within City Center environments, the player may see ADVENT posters that represent the new world order or signage advertising the benefits of living in the City Centers. Other environments may even have elements that give the player a glimpse of a lifestyle that is long since gone. We also spend a lot of time trying to craft buildings and spaces that allow the player to create their own emergent narrative. Do the procedurally generated maps influence the visual design? Yes, procedurally generated maps greatly affect the visual design, since the maps are a critical part of the gameplay, and gameplay is most important to us. Since everything is generated on a grid, there are several restrictions that you need to embrace, such as the larger chunks — like buildings — are interchangeable and need to have a defined footprint. We came up with a few sizes based on the metrics from Enemy Unknown that give us some creative flexibility, but at the edge of the footprint they need to blend seamlessly with the ground. The biggest challenge with procedural swapping is making sure that the objects that can change between maps have an object of similar size and volume to swap with. The best illustration of this is found when swapping out trees, bushes, and rocks when going between biomes like tundra to arid. Overall, I am really happy with how our system has worked out. How collaborative is the design process between the artists and designers? The design process is very collaborative. Typically, we will get a brief description from design on what they are looking for mechanically. The artists then go off and create some simple drawings that try and solve the problem from a few different angles. As we go through iterations, both departments sign off on ideas during the process until we have the final solution. We have an experienced team, so there are usually a lot of conversations between the departments, and we believe that good ideas can come from anywhere. Where do you start when it comes to designing how a new unit or alien will look? For example, was the Viper always intended to be snake-like, or was that something that evolved over time based on gameplay needs or other factors? Since we are so gameplay-driven, we usually have the key abilities for that unit in mind, and that in turn drives the look. In the Viper’s case, design knew they wanted a terrifying enemy that could pull you out of cover and then potentially kill you. Tongue Pull and Bind are pretty fantastic abilities and needed a fantastic alien to give them some visual flair. A lot of people wanted the Snakeman from UFO Defense to appear in Enemy Unknown, so this seemed like an obvious choice, and eventually led to the Viper you see in XCOM 2. Did you try out a lot of other ideas for how that enemy would look? What made the snake-like look work? We went through a few ideas, but the cool thing was all of them were honing in on a general look of a snake with arms. The hardest part was trying to keep her elegant. She needed to be fluid in the way she moved, which was paramount to the character, and also led to her overall appearance.  Smooth lines, lots of curves, and being long enough and thin enough to coil up within one of our grid spaces really made it work. What’s your favorite new addition to the game? What was the most challenging to create from your perspective? My favorite new thing is the procedural nature of the game and how it permeates the entire game from environments, to characters, to mission objectives. The procedural levels were certainly the most challenging thing to create. XCOM: Enemy Unknown players wanted more maps, so this procedural level system was one of the first things we committed to on XCOM 2. Figuring out how to make our levels look organic but change dynamically was a pretty tough challenge to solve, but I am happy with the end result. The visual diversity we have between environments and the ability to have tactical experiences at any time of day, as well as in different kinds of weather, adds a lot to the experience. And to see all of this stuff come together is something I am really excited about.

Now, a new study in Nature just made another candidate look even more promising: Enceladus, an icy moon of Saturn, likely has an active hydrothermal system. Enceladus has been a popular target for the existence of life ever since Cassini first saw plumes of water vapor coming from its south pole back in 2005. Until now, however, it was unclear how those plumes were connected to the potential subsurface ocean. The icy surface is estimated to be over 25 miles thick, and there was little evidence of hydrothermal activity. But a team led by the University of Colorado's Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics found tiny grains of rock — just 2–8 nm in radius, not much bigger than a strand of human DNA — with the Cassini spacecraft they believe were formed by hydrothermal vents in the ocean of Enceladus. The grains are rich in silicon and are like what is found in sand and quartz here on Earth, which are commonly formed by hydrothermal processes.   The existence of these grains can only mean that there is an active hydrothermal system working on Enceladus, according to the authors of the paper. Here's how the process starts: The gravitational tug of Saturn helps heat the ocean below Enceladus's surface to at least 90 degrees Celsius, or about 200 degrees Fahrenheit. That helps dissolve minerals from the moon's rocky core. That water cools on its way towards the surface, and those minerals get trapped in larger grains of ice as they push through vents and out into space. There, the ice erodes, and the tiny silicon-rich grains are left bare, where the scientists were able to detect them with Cassini's dust analyzer.   Hot water wicks minerals away from the core, similar to here on Earth The paper's authors spent four years studying data from the Cassini spacecraft and performing computer simulations and experiments to reach their conclusions. ""We methodically searched for alternative explanations for the nanosilica grains, but every new result pointed to a single, most likely origin,"" says Frank Postberg in the ESA's release on the study. Postberg is a scientist who works with Cassini's dust analyzer data at the University of Heidelberg in Germany and is a co-author on the paper. The news is both exciting and important because hydrothermal vents are believed to have spawned life on Earth. Before today we knew that Enceladus had water. Now it looks like that water is heated and has minerals. Those are the most basic ingredients for life as we know it, and it means that Enceladus is about to become a more popular place to explore.",0.5962326965776638,0.40376730342233624,0.8267954303670586,471,4.8301486199575372,268,5.6492537313432836,1,2,Science

About 480 million years ago, the seven-foot-long Aegirocassis benmoulae swam about in the sea. The lobster-like sea creature used its flaps — swimming devices on its belly and back — and long segmented body to get around. And unlike many of its fellow relatives, it ate plankton. This means that it had to swim with its appendages outstretched in front of its head, dragging a net-like ""sieve"" made of long downward-directed spines through the water. ""It would have dwarfed anything else at the time."" ""It would have dwarfed anything else at the time, being twice as big as the next biggest animal — at the very least,"" says Peter Van Roy, a paleontologist at Yale University and a co-author of a Nature study published today that contributes entirely new information about Aegirocassis benmoulae. ""They were absolutely massive.""    illustration by Marianne Collins, ArtofFact  A lot of what you’ve just read wasn’t known until recently. When the Aegirocassis benmoulae's relatives — a group of marine animals called anomalocaridids — were first discovered, paleontologists looked their spiny appendages and thought they represented the body of a shrimp. Some also believed that their toothed mouths were jellyfish, and their complete bodies were actually described as sea cucumbers. Then, in 1985, a group of researchers figured it out. The bits and pieces that people were associating with various other species actually belonged to a single group of early marine animals called anomalocardids — large sea creatures that are ancestors to all arthropods, a category of animals composed of everything from lobsters and crabs to scorpions and ants. ""Nevertheless, the affinities of anomalocaridids remained enigmatic: it would take almost another decade before they were finally recognized as arthropods,"" Van Roy says. ""With a big smile, he walks over to me and says, ‘you know, I have something to show you.'"" In 2011, things started coming together. Before that, paleontologists thought that Aegirocassis benmoulae was a predatory animal, much like the majority of anomalocaridids that had come before it. But the man who found the Aegirocassis benmoulae  fossils — a local collector in Morocco by the name of Mohamed Ben Moula who doesn’t have paleontology training  — changed all that. ""With a big smile, he walks over to me and says, ‘you know, I have something to show you,’"" Van Roy says. Ben Moula showed him a beautifully preserved appendage with ""very delicate filter-feeding morphology; it had all these fine spines,"" Van Roy says. ""It was shocking."" To show their gratitude, Van Roy and his team named Aegirocassis benmoulae after the Moroccan collector. In the time of the Aegirocassis benmoulae, during the the Ordovician period, plankton ecosystems were changing and many new species of plankton were popping up. This likely spurred the emergence of this large plankton-eating anomalocaridid. And going from predation to plankton-filtering is part of a larger evolutionary theme, Van Roy says. ""Exactly the same thing happened much, much later in sharks and whales,"" he says. ""They started out as predators, and because of a major plankton diversification suddenly you get extremely big filter-feeding animals, like whale sharks and blue whales."" Researchers also think Crocodiles went through a similar period in which a large plankton-eating species of crocs emerged. ""They reached massive sizes,"" he says. ""And our animal is the oldest example of this."" this explains how some arthropods ended up with limbs that have two branches  The researchers also had no idea that Aegirocassis benmoulae — or any of other anomalocaridids, for that matter — had ventral flaps. No one thought they had fin-like swimming devices on their bellies, Van Roy says. ""They were believed to lack limbs on the body."" This might seem like a small oversight, but it’s actually quite significant from an evolutionary standpoint; it’s the missing link that explains how some crustaceans — like shrimp and lobsters — ended up with limbs that have two branches. These branches are involved in everything from gas exchange, to swimming, walking and grasping, and transferring sperm.   Biramous limbs, Zhang, X.-l., et al. (2007) The fact that anomalocaridids had two sets of flaps — instead of just one set on their backs — supports the idea that the two-branched limbs we see in most crustaceans arose from the fusion of the dorsal and ventral flaps. ""Because these structures are not yet joined together at their base in anomalocaridids, this confirms that anomalocaridids represent a very early stage in the evolution of arthropods,"" Van Roy says. It's one of the most exciting discoveries he has ever made. ""I thought ‘jeez, is this really true?'""  ""When I discovered these flaps, the implications for the evolution of limbs and for anomalocaridids… I thought ‘jeez, is this really true?,'"" Van Roy says. ""And so for weeks, I went back to the fossils every day just to make sure that ‘yes the flaps are there, I’m not being crazy, I’m not seeing things.’"" He wasn’t crazy or seeing things. Eventually Van Roy and his team of researchers looked at other, older anomalocaridid fossils and discovered that the flaps had simply been overlooked. ""When we went back [to the older fossils], we saw that they actually also had this second set of flaps."" It’s important to note that although Aegirocassis benmoulae was the largest animal on Earth at the time of existence, it isn’t the largest arthropod to ever exist. That title goes to the sea scorpion. It was eight feet long.   Sea Scorpion. [Credit: Ryan Somma/ FLickr] Now that the researchers have published their findings, Van Roy says that he plans to move on to other types of arthropods. But he doesn’t think he will leave anomalocaridids behind; there is far too much knowledge to gain from them. ""There’s still new material to study, and much more to learn from the specimens that have already been studied — this study isn’t finished by a long stretch.""

Philae is in the shade — not good for solar power The spacecraft successfully touched down on comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko in November last year, but an unexpectedly bouncy landing left it stranded in an area far colder and with far less sunlight than scientists had originally planned. The craft was able to carry out a number of experiments over the next three days, but eventually entered a low power state before it ran out of power. Now, as the comet draws closer to the Sun and receives more heat and light, scientists are hopeful it will awaken again in the coming weeks, to finish off the work it started. ""Philae currently receives about twice as much solar energy as it did in November last year,"" says the lander's project manager Stephan Ulamec.

For Philae to wake up completely, the interior of the craft must be at least -45ºC and its solar panels must be receiving a minimum of 5.5 watts of power. Once its core systems realize that these criteria have been met, the lander will attempt to charge its battery, switching on its receiver every 30 minutes to listen for instructions from the orbiting Rosetta. Scientists say it's possible that Philae has already woken up, but that the lander doesn't yet have enough power to communicate with Rosetta. ""At this time, we do not yet know that the lander is awake,"" says Koen Geurts of the Rosetta control center. ""To send us an answer, Philae must also turn its transmitter – and that requires additional power."" Philae gets 1.3 hours of sunlight per cometary ""day"" Between the 11th and 20th of March, Rosetta will make a number of flybys during Philae's daytime — that is, when the side of the comet its on is exposed to sunlight. A day on 67P currently lasts 12.4 hours and scientists believe that Philae is only exposed to the Sun for 1.3 hours every day — not even half of what was planned for. If initial communication is made in the next few weeks, scientists can begin checking on Philae's condition. ""We will then evaluate the data,"" says Geurts. ""What is the state of the rechargeable battery? Is everything on the lander still functioning? What is the temperature? How much energy is it receiving?"" Even if this initial attempt at communication doesn't work, ESA scientists are hopeful that they will have more chances in the future as the comet gets closer to the Sun.

There's pictures of animals like the tiny parasitic wasp just 0.75 millimeters in length, and of creatures not yet fully formed, such as the five-month fetus of an unborn horse, still enveloped in the cloud-like swirl of a uterus. The winning images from the competition will be announced later this month on March 20th, with the whole collection then displayed across the UK and in the US at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Koch Institute and the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston.

That's why some people just copy good tweets from other people and act like they came up with the 140-character witticism on their own. This has been going on since the beginning of Twitter. It now appears Twitter is using its legal authority to crack down on these tweet-stealers. A number of tweets have been deleted on copyright grounds for apparently stealing a bad joke. As first spotted by @PlagiarismBad, at least five separate tweets have been deleted by Twitter for copying this joke:  saw someone spill their high end juice cleanse all over the sidewalk and now I know god is on my side Olga Lexell, who, according to her Twitter bio, is a freelance writer in LA, appears to be the first person to publish the joke on Twitter. In a tweet posted this afternoon, she confirmed that she did file a request to have the tweets removed. She added that most of the accounts that were reusing her tweets without accreditation were ""spam accounts that repost tons of other people's jokes every day."" This also isn't the first time Twitter has complied with a request like this: Lexell tells The Verge that she's filed similar requests for other jokes. Twitter staffers typically remove the offending tweets ""within a few days"" without asking Lexell any follow-up questions.   DMCA strikes back Twitter, like many companies that host content from users, has an entire system for handling claims of copyright infringement. Under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), Twitter is provided ""safe harbor"" from copyright claims so long as it does not try to protect infringing material. Typically, claims concern embedded media like photos and videos, or they're for tweets that link to other websites that are illegally hosting copyrighted material, like movies. It's rarer for a DMCA request to involve the actual text of a 140-character tweet. Anyone can submit a claim through Twitter's web form, and Twitter staffers weed through the claims to decide which appear valid. If it decides to follow through with the request, Twitter can then remove or delete the tweet. The company's policy is to then give the offending user 10 days to file a counter notice. Twitter also publishes DMCA requests publicly on the website Chilling Effects, though records of this particular claim do not appear to be on the site yet. Twitter declined to comment for this story. Of course, it should come as little surprise that people and corporations have tried to use DMCA takedowns for illegitimate reasons. Most recently, The Sunday Times tried to use DMCA to block criticism of one of its articles, and GoPro was accused of trying a similar tactic to cut down on negative reviews.

Leah Reich was one of the first internet advice columnists. Her column ""Ask Leah"" ran on IGN, where she gave advice to gamers for two and a half years. After IGN, she completed her PhD in sociology, but so many people mixed it up with psychology that she figured she might as well get back into giving advice. You can write to her at askleah@theverge.com. The first time someone asked me for dating advice, I was 15 and had never had a boyfriend. My brother, 20 and away at college, called me at home in rural Colorado from the co-op where he lived in Los Angeles. ""How do I ask her out? I can't ask her out,"" he said to me. ""Why not?"" I asked. ""Because,"" he said. ""What's the worst thing that could happen?"" I asked. ""Well... I mean, she could say no."" ""Nope. The worst thing that could happen is she could laugh in your face."" ""Wait, what?"" You never know — maybe she'll say yes ""But she won't! I mean, why would she? Yeah, her saying no might suck, but as long as she doesn't laugh in your face, it isn't nearly as bad as it could be. And you never know. Maybe she'll say yes."" Okay, sure. Someone laughing in your face isn't the absolute worst thing that can happen. They can laugh in your face, and then tag you in a Facebook post for everyone to continue humiliating you. But when someone laughed in my face at a junior high dance, I was humiliated, and I never forgot how it felt. There I was, a little sixth grader, just 10 years old. He was an eighth grader. I walked up to him alone, ballsy as anything, as he stood there flanked by his friends, and I asked him to be my boyfriend.  He looked at me. He looked at his friends. Everyone looked at me again. They didn't say anything, but I could still hear them laughing from the bathroom stall where I spent the next hour crying. That was the first — and the last — time I asked someone out for a long, long time. So when my brother and anyone else after him came to me for advice, I remembered how stupid I felt, how mortified and miserable, and how long it took me to get over it. How to ask for a raise, how to mend a broken friendship, how to get into and out of trouble... A few things have changed since I was 15. I've gotten over that early humiliation, only to experience many, many others. I've asked at least one other person out, and I've had a boyfriend or two. I've been a total disaster and gotten my shit together, only to lose it again. I don't base all my advice on my own experiences anymore, but I don't discount what I've felt and how that can help me understand how someone else might feel. I've written hundreds of advice columns as ""Ask Leah"" over at IGN, some of which you may have read if you've been a fan of that site for long enough. I've moved on from giving advice about dating to giving advice about almost everything under the sun: how to deal with being bullied at school or at work, how to ask for a raise, how to have a better relationship with your parents, how to mend a broken friendship, how to get into and out of trouble. But here's what hasn't changed: I never forgot what it felt like to have someone come to me totally freaked out about something that seems totally easy, like talking to another person. And I never, ever forgot what it felt like to have someone humiliate me. I need you to help me keep things cool here Giving and getting advice isn't always so simple as ""how do I ask someone out?"" The questions people ask and the answers I give aren't always about love and dating. In fact, even when they are about love and dating, they're more about communicating and being kind. Plus, all these questions and answers don't always come from an easy place or an experience we can all share. If that were true, I wouldn't have been able to write ""Ask Leah"" for all those gamers — I was never a 16-year-old boy who'd never talked to a girl, but I was also never a 25-year-old wondering about gender and being trans. I don't need to have the same experience as you to give you advice, but what I do need to do is listen to you and respect you. But the truth is, we all need to do that — out in the world but here in this little corner where my column lives, too. As both my letter writers and my readers, I need you to help me keep things cool here. After all, this is where you come for advice, too. I'm here to help all of us learn how to communicate and act like decent, kind humans So this is the kind of advice I give. I don't tell people whatever it is they want to hear. I tell them things they need to hear, even if they're not totally ready. But more than that, I'm here to help all of us learn how to communicate and act like decent, kind humans. Sometimes it seems like the technology we have makes communication harder even as it's supposed to make it easier, and it gives us more ways to see how awful people can be. But the truth of it is that people are always going to be people — complex, weird, sometimes kind, quite often not nice at all. Navigating all of this, whether in dating, in friendship, or at work, can be hard as hell. That's why this advice column isn't just for guys or just about dating. It's not just about being online or doing things IRL. It's about how to go out and be a human being, in the world, on your phones, on the internet, and in whatever comes next.

The patents cover everything from in-car software and systems to actual hydrogen production. Tesla made a similar move earlier this year ""in the spirit of the open source movement, for the advancement of electric vehicle technology,"" in the words of CEO Elon Musk. Ironically, automotive giant Toyota may need help bolstering industry support more than upstart Tesla: Superchargers are already deployed globally, and the company doesn't need any help making EVs viable. In Toyota's case, hydrogen only works if there's a robust network of refueling stations for fuel cell car owners to frequent — and right now, they simply don't exist on any scale.    Tesla made a similar move earlier this year Hydrogen production and supply patents will be made available royalty-free indefinitely, while Toyota's vehicle patents will stay free until 2020; the company presumably hopes that gives other automakers enough time to spin up development on a vehicle in a way that will keep R&D costs low. In return, Toyota is asking (but not requiring) that companies offer a reciprocal agreement on their own patents. Patent-sharing deals are common across the automotive and tech industries, so such an arrangement wouldn't be out of the ordinary. The Mirai, Toyota's production hydrogen sedan, will go on sale this year — but only in California at first, where it's been subsidizing the build-out of a modest network of stations. Several states in the US Northeast will be next to get it.

Construction was supposed to began two years ago, but was delayed over land acquisitions and disputes over funding. The system is now set to be completed by 2028, though as the Los Angeles Times reports, officials still need to secure full funding, and Republicans in Congress have said they will not commit federal money to it. Yet state authorities remain confident that financing will be secured, whether through the federal government or real estate development rights, noting that the project will be harder to stop once construction is underway.

The fun focuses on three displays — 12.8-inch and 8-inch center displays, plus a 12.3-inch instrument cluster — that almost completely eliminate the standard tactile controls, a little bit like Tesla has done in the Model S. The center display also offers touch feedback, so the driver knows when they've actuated a command without necessarily needing to look at it. Both the appearances of the displays and the color of the interior lighting can be customized to the driver's liking — not unlike a smartphone, VW notes. But here's the best part: cameras mounted inside the cabin allow you to trigger commands with hand gestures, so you never actually need to touch the displays at all.

It’s a little crazy. Actually, it’s a lot crazy.  I first got a glimpse of the system at an event several weeks ago in San Francisco, where Gogoro CEO Horace Luke worked the room with the charm, energy, and nerves of a man who was revealing his life’s passion for the first time. Luke is a designer by trade with long stints at Nike, Microsoft, and HTC under his belt, and his creative roots show in everything Gogoro has done. The scooter just looks fresh, as if Luke hasn’t designed one before (which is true).  Maybe it’s the former smartphone designer in him that’s showing through. Luke is joined by a number of former colleagues at HTC, including co-founder Matt Taylor. Cher Wang, HTC’s billionaire founder, counts herself among Gogoro’s investors. The company has raised a total of $150 million, which is now on the line as it tries to convince riders, cities, and anyone else who will listen that it can pull this all off.  In reality, I’m deeply skeptical. But if you let Luke rub off on you long enough, you can’t help but believe they’ve got it figured out.   At a high level, Gogoro is announcing the Smartscooter. It’s probably the coolest two-wheeled runabout you can buy: it’s electric, looks unlike anything else on the market, and incorporates a host of legitimately unique features. All-LED headlights and taillights with programmable action sequences lend a Knight Rider aesthetic. An always-on Bluetooth connection links into a smartphone companion app, where you can change a variety of vehicle settings. The key, a circular white fob, is completely wireless like in a modern car. You can even download new sounds for startup, shutdown, turn signals, and so on; it’s a bit of an homage to the founders’ roots at HTC, in an industry where ringtones are big business. It’s probably the coolest two-wheeled runabout you can buy ""Electric scooter"" inherently sounds safe and slow, but Gogoro is working hard to dispel that image upfront. It’ll reliably do smoky burnouts — several were demonstrated for me by the company’s test rider — and it hits 50 km/h (31 mph) in 4.2 seconds. (It’s surreal seeing a scooter, the icon of practical personal transport, lay a perfect circle of rubber on a public street as the rider slowly pivots the machine on its front wheel.) Top speed is 60 mph, which compares favorably to a Vespa 946’s 57 mph. The company’s promotional video features a black leather-clad badass leaning hard through sweeping turns, superbike-style, dragging his knees on the pavement along the way. Luke says they’re appealing to young riders, and it certainly comes through.    But ultimately, it’s just a scooter. The secret sauce is in the infrastructure that lies beneath. It’s not just that you don’t plug the Smartscooter in — you can’t. When power runs low, you visit charging kiosks placed strategically around a city (Gogoro calls them GoStations) to swap your batteries, a process that only takes a few seconds. The hope is that the company can sell the Smartscooter for the same cost as a premium gasoline model by removing the very expensive cells, instead offering use of the GoStations through a subscription plan. The subscription takes the place of the money you’d otherwise spend on gas; you’re basically paying monthly for the energy. If the ""sharing economy"" is hot right now — ZipCar, Citibike, so on — Gogoro wants to establish itself as the de facto battery sharing ecosystem. (The company hasn't announced pricing for either the scooter or the subscription plans yet.) ""By 2030, there’s going to be 41 megacities, the majority in the developing world,"" Luke says, pointing to a map centered on Southeast Asia. It’s a region that has succumbed to extreme air pollution in recent years, a victim of industrialization, lax environmental regulation, and a rising middle class with money to spend. It’s also a region that depends on two-wheeled transportation in a way that the Western world never has. Scooters, which flow by the thousands through the clogged streets of metropolises like Bangkok and Ho Chi Minh City, are ripe targets for slashing smog; many models actually belch more pollutants into the air than a modern sedan. The de facto battery sharing ecosystem Electric vehicles are frequently maligned for merely moving the pollution problem elsewhere rather than solving it outright — you’ve got to produce the electricity somehow, after all — but Luke and Taylor are well-prepared for the question, insisting that you’re better off burning coal outside of a city to power clean vehicles inside of it. Long term, they note, clean energy probably becomes viable in today’s emerging markets. The batteries have been designed in collaboration with Panasonic, a prolific battery supplier that has enjoyed the EV spotlight in recent years thanks to its partnership with Tesla and an investment in Elon Musk’s vaunted Gigafactory. These are no Tesla batteries, though: each dark gray brick weighs about the same as a bowling ball, equipped with an ergonomic bright green handle on one end. They’re designed to be lugged around by anyone and everyone, but I can imagine really small riders struggling with the heft. Luke and Panasonic EVP Yoshi Yamada seem to be as excited about the batteries as anything else, lauding their NFC authentication, 256-bit encryption (""banks use 128-bit encryption,"" Luke says), and smart circuitry. Basically, they’ll refuse to charge or discharge unless placed in an authorized device, and they’re completely inert otherwise. Swap batteries and get back on the road in under half a minute That circuitry is undoubtedly driven in part by a desire to lock down Gogoro’s ecosystem and render the batteries useless to anyone not using a Gogoro-sanctioned device — yes, battery DRM — but it’s also about making the battery swapping experience seamless. The Smartscooter’s bulbous seat lifts to reveal a lighted cargo area and two battery docks. Riders in need of more power would stop at GoStation, grab both batteries from underneath the seat, and slide them into the kiosk’s spring-loaded slots. The machine identifies the rider based on the batteries’ unique IDs, greets them, scans for any warnings or problems that have been recorded (say, a brake light is out or the scooter was dropped since the last swap), offers service options, and ejects a fresh set of batteries, all in the course of about six seconds. I’d guess that an experienced Smartscooter rider could probably stop and be back on the road in under half a minute. The concept exploits certain realities about scooters that aren’t necessarily true for other kinds of vehicles. Most importantly, they’re strictly urban machines: you won’t generally ride a scooter cross-country, and you definitely won’t be able to with a Smartscooter. It’s designed to stay inside the footprint of the GoStations that support it. It’ll go 60 miles on a single charge — not very good compared to a gas model, but the problem is tempered to some degree by how effortless the battery swaps are. A dense network of swapping stations solves electric’s single biggest challenge, which is charge time. ""What you’ve seen today could not have been done three or four years ago."" If Luke is the face of Gogoro, CTO Matt Taylor is the arbiter of reality, the man behind the scenes translating Luke’s fever dreams into tangible results. A lifelong engineer at Motorola and Microsoft before his time at HTC, Taylor spends my briefing burning through spec sheet after spec sheet, datum after datum. It’s as if he has mathematically deduced that Gogoro’s time has come. ""What you’ve seen today could not have been done three or four years ago,"" he beams, noting that everything about the Smartscooter was developed in-house because off-the-shelf components simply weren’t good enough. The liquid-cooled motor is made by Gogoro. So is the unique aluminum frame, which is acoustically enhanced to give the scooter a Jetsons-esque sound as it whizzes by. Taylor also beams when talking about the cloud that connects the GoStations to one another and to the Smartscooters. Everything learns from everything else. Stations with high traffic might be set to charge batteries faster and more frequently, while lower-use stations might wait until late in the night to charge, relieving pressure on strained power grids. As the batteries age, they become less efficient; stations could be set to dispense older batteries to less aggressive drivers. With the smartphone app, drivers can reserve batteries at nearby stations for up to 10 minutes. Luke says there’ll inevitably be times where the station you want doesn’t have charged batteries available, but with careful planning and load balancing, he hopes it won’t happen more than once or twice a year. But therein lies the problem: the way Gogoro works — and the only way it works — is by flooding cities with GoStations. ""One station per mile is what we’re looking for,"" Luke says, noting that the company has the capital to roll out to one or two urban areas initially. The kiosks, which cost ""under $10,000"" each, would be owned by Gogoro, not a third party. They can go pretty much anywhere — they cart in and out, are vandalism-resistant, and screw into place — but someone still needs to negotiate with property owners to get them deployed and powered. It’s an enormous, expensive task that runs a high risk of bureaucratic inefficiency, and it needs to be repeated ad nauseam for every city where Gogoro wants its scooters. So far, it isn’t naming which cities will launch first, but Southeast Asia is clearly priority one. Luke also seems to take great interest in San Francisco, where our briefing was held. He says there’ll be news on deployments in 2015. Gogoro envisions an entire ""second life"" for its batteries Company officials are focusing on that initial launch (and for good reason), but there’s more on the horizon. Without offering any details, they say there are other kinds of vehicles in development that would make use of Gogoro’s batteries and stations. I specifically ask about cars, since it doesn’t seem to me that you could effectively power a full-on automobile with a few bowling ball-sized batteries. ""4-wheel is not out of the question at all,"" Luke assures me. He seems more reticent about licensing Gogoro as a platform that other vehicle makers could use, but leaves it open as a possibility. And when the batteries aren’t good enough to use on the road anymore — about 70 percent of their new capacity — Gogoro doesn’t want to recycle them. Instead, it envisions an entire ""second life"" for thousands of cells, powering data centers or homes. Luke thinks there could even be a third life after that, powering lights and small appliances in extremely rural areas of the world. For now, though, he’s just trying to get the scooter launched. At the end of my briefing, I looked back through my notes to fully digest the absurdity of what Gogoro is trying to do: launch a vehicle from a company that has never done so, power it with a worldwide network of proprietary battery vending machines, launch a few more vehicle models, sell old batteries to Google and Facebook, wash, rinse, repeat. Reduce smog, balance power grids, save the world. I can certainly see why it was an appealing alternative to the incremental grind of designing the next smartphone at HTC — but I can also make an argument that they’re out of their minds. I don’t think Luke would disagree, but he’d also argue that you’ve got to be a little crazy to take on something this big. If he’s feeling any late-stage trepidation over the magnitude of the undertaking, he certainly isn’t showing it. ""Everything was about getting it perfect, so we did everything from the ground up.""

In reality, the company was about to freak me out. First, I got a glimpse of a collision avoidance system using an array of fairly well-concealed external sensors on one of the i3s. BMW set up a bunch of big, soft blocks dressed to look like walls and other hazards — it was a little Super Mario-esque, come to think of it — and told me to punch the gas in their direction. That's a tough command to process, and it took me a second to work up the courage. Tentatively, I approached the first couple of blocks in the car; I got so close that I was sure I'd touch them, but at the last moment, I heard a soft ""beep"" and felt a moderate application of the brakes that stopped me with probably no more than an inch to spare (BMW is quick to note that the sensors they're using are next-gen and very accurate — these aren't the ultrasonic parking sensors you see on today's bumpers).    The system works in reverse, too, and on the sides — I tried turning too sharply at a corner in such a way that a normal car would've taken a huge, expensive gash across the doors. This i3, though, with its enhanced instincts of self-preservation, slowed to a halt before it could take any damage. The system is designed to still permit you to park in a tight spot without getting in the way; I tried parallel parking with no issue. You can tell it's designed to be super careful Next, I tried the company's automatic valet system in another i3, which uses basically the same set of high-definition sensors to map the environment around the car. We've seen a variety of self-parking systems from automakers at CES over the years, but this one seemed to be the most polished: it doesn't require any special equipment or beacons in the parking garage, it'll just autonomously find a spot to park without anyone in the vehicle. It's initiated using an app that BMW has designed for Samsung's Gear S smartwatch, where you can see the status of your car (charge level, for instance) and tap a command to go park. Slowly — like, really slowly, 5 mph or so — the i3 lurched forward on its own, seeking out an open space. It rounded a corner where the other BMWs were parked, found a slot next to an M4 convertible, and eased its way in. The app can summon the car, too. I rode alone in the passenger seat for this leg of the journey, which was really eerie — there are no words to describe the feeling of sitting by yourself in a car that's slowly moving and turning on its own. You can tell it's designed to be super careful: it moves no faster than brisk walking pace and has the same anti-collision sensors I'd just experienced in another heart-pounding demo. Still, you're at the mercy of a computer, which is hard to get over.   I returned to the anti-collision demo one last time, where BMW staff encouraged me to be way more aggressive. So I was: I drove the i3 like I'd stolen it, but I couldn't get it to hit anything no matter how hard I tried. Any steering angle, any gas pedal input, the car just didn't care. It's an additional margin of safety that I'm guessing will eliminate a lot of expensive fender benders in a few years. Both of these systems are basically branches of the same R&D effort happening inside the company — autonomous driving, which BMW still believes is a few years away. The sensors required for this level of accuracy still need to get smaller and easier to integrate into the car's bodywork. It's encouraging, though: if a car is tuned into its environment well enough to consistently stop a driver from bumping into things, it can probably stop itself when there's no one in the driver's seat. h2.ces-promo a{  background: #fa4b2a;  border-radius: 3px;  padding: 5px 14px 0px;  font-family: ff-din-web-condensed,Helvetica,sans-serif;  text-transform: uppercase;  font-weight: normal;  font-size: 30px;  text-align:center;  display:inline-block;  margin:0px auto;  color: #fff;}  h2.ces-promo a:hover {      background:#bf2a0d;      color:#fff;      text-decoration:none;    }}",0.35532540496342535,0.6446745950365746,0.16934445344044416,767,4.4745762711864403,412,5.9635922330097086,0,4,"CES 2015, Transportation, Hands-on"

The unconventional aspect about today is that the new Tegra X1 is a superchip designed to be embedded inside cars.

All those numbers will be put to use in building up a very ambitious plan for increased car awareness and a proliferation of screens inside the car, but the X1's most immediate demonstration is in the central infotainment hub. I got to play with it briefly after Nvidia's press event and it left me with a positive impression. Nvidia's demo infotainment system has five main areas: one each for music and in-car controls, one for smartphone integration via things like Android Auto, one for viewing feeds from cameras around the car, and a final one for navigation. Nothing's incredibly fancy about this interface, but the 3D navigation is presented in a really cool, ghostly look, and is navigable via the typical touchscreen gestures. Though the demo unit in the video above didn't respond to all my gestures, errors were the exception rather than the rule, and it just felt pleasingly futuristic to be navigating my way around a beautifully animated wireframe city. Because of the vast, vertically oriented screen, everything's big and easy to read, and you can also split the screen into two: dedicating a half to, say, the music controls, and another for navigation.   There's nothing revolutionary to report here, and no carmaker has committed to implementing this exact system, but it still presents an appealing vision of future interactions inside the car. The Tegra X1 is helping to deliver fast and fluid interactions, and Nvidia's pointing in the right direction with its software, aiming for pretty simplicity — so that the UI can remain glanceable and easily navigable — instead of overbearing complexity tacked on just to show off the power within.",0.5183986773221446,0.4816013226778554,0.16822562377454234,342,4.9590643274853798,226,5.8628318584070795,0,2,"CES 2015, Transportation, Hands-on, Videos"

Mercedes actually calls the cabin ""lounge-like,"" thanks to four rotating seats that can face each other. An array of screens throughout the car let passengers interact with controls and entertainment, supporting not-quite-production features like gestures and eye tracking. One notable feature is the pair of ""LED fields"" at the front and rear that change color based on the car's current driving mode: white in manual, blue in autonomous.

One such brand is Velox, and its mission is to refine the classic watch and bring it up to date. Its first product is the XC1, which looks very much like modern take on Braun's classic digital watch, the DW20. Velox doesn't call out that association explicitly, though, instead describing its look as ""futuristic simplicity."" You’ll find that concept — holding onto the past while simultaneously marching into the future — repeated by any number of companies. Design and processes have matured to the point where it’s possible to create technological marvels that subtly play on our historical notions of what the future will look like. Staying true to functionalist principles adhered to by iconic designers like Dieter Rams, the XC1’s function is its form: the focal point is a simple LCD that displays the time, and there’s little decoration to take away from it. ""You have a built-in filter as a designer that crystallizes what is relevant in a modern product."" These principles help the XC1 look both unique and modern while still revering historical design. ""I believe you have a built-in filter as a designer that crystallizes what is relevant in a modern product,"" says André Olovsson, Head of Design at Velox; keep what’s important, and cast aside the rest. A great example of letting go of the past is the XC1’s strap; although its face is steel, the strap is silicone, and can be swapped out for a different color band. The use of silicone also makes it very light for a metal-faced watch; it weighs just short of 1.5 ounces.  The optimistic futurism that prevailed through design in the '60s and '70s holds a great influence over Olvasson, who has a collection of 'inspirational' images depicting watches like the Omega Time Computer I (TC1), as well as imagery from 2001: A Space Odyssey, Moonraker, and The Green Slime. Although the future dreamed by Kubrick and others hasn’t come to pass, the objects Olvasson and other present-day designers are crafting would so easily fit into many classic sci-fi movies’ fictional worlds. ""The visions of the '60s and '70's, the 'future seen from the past,' they're extremely cool these days,"" says Olvosson, who has worked with watches since graduating in 2007, and previously designed timepieces for Lambretta, another brand owned by Velox's parent company Capella. While he reveres the designs of Rams, he cites the work of architect Oscar Niemeyer and artist Syd Mead (who was involved in classic movies like Bladerunner and Tron) as a huge influence. At first glance, the XC1 evokes memories of something much older: the DW20, Braun’s first digital watch. The DW20 was designed by Dieter Rams and Dietrich Lubs, Braun's prolific creatives  whose every product brought us closer to a functionalist future. Visually it’s more than a few steps removed from the DW20, but it does resemble something Braun’s famed designers may have created if they had the complex processes and materials available today. The 1978 Braun DW20 watch. (Jack Gertson / Braun LCD watches) Any resemblance to the DW20 is purely coincidental, or perhaps a sign of Rams' continued influence over product designers, Olvasson tells me. ""I'm very inspired by Rams, but actually I didn't think of the DW20 when I sketched the XC1 ... I wanted to make a watch that had a digital movement but a round shape, to not lose the symbol that we relate so much to time and watches. Moving forward, he hopes Velox can challenge classic watch segments with a refined vision. The company is treading a fine line right now, trying to bring classic elements found in Braun and other companies' back catalogs into the modern era. Braun sold the license to sell watches under its name a few years ago, and Zeon, the company that bought it, is taking a similar approach to Velox’s. In addition to producing replica versions of classics, Zeon has attempted to update Braun's design language with timepieces like the BN0036. While it's an attractive watch, you could argue that, apparently accidentally, Olvasson and Velox have stayed truer to the Braun of old than the company that owns the brand.",0.7666567435351429,0.2333432564648571,0.2028318400726626,716,4.9748603351955305,418,5.9282296650717701,0,0,"Design, Report"

The Eero Saarinen-designed facility was a hub for scientists who helped contribute to innovations like touch-tone dialing, the microwave, and the cellphone. Its complicated yet functional layout allowed workers to collaborate by running into each other in its sprawling hallways, sharing the occasional cigarette on its ashtray-equipped balconies. But that was over a half-century ago — since 2007, Bell Labs in Holmdel, New Jersey, has been empty. It was shut down when its owner, French telecommunications company Alcatel-Lucent, consolidated research facilities, leaving all of its 1.9 million square feet vacant and waiting for either destruction or revival. Not only is the complex a Saarinen masterpiece, but after its closing Alcatel-Lucent cared for Bell Labs as if it were still inhabited, maintaining the 470-acre grounds, sweeping the floors, and trimming the interior plants. The odds of finding another single tenant for the massive space is unlikely, and there were talks of razing the structure, but those were quickly silenced as the idea outraged scientists and architects around the world.   Can Bell Labs be reimagined while maintaining its architectural roots? Now under the new ownership of Somerset Development, the real challenge begins: readapting Bell Lab's complicated layout for modern use. Using a $100 million redevelopment plan, Somerset wants to turn the complex into an urban center for Holmdel, housing retail and healthcare spaces, offices, and coffee shops. It's currently working with New York architect Alexander Gorlin to come up with ways of bringing the complex back to life without compromising Saarinen's original design. Not only will Gorlin have to figure out logistics of lighting, acoustics, and how to make the exterior's clad in single-pane glass with inoperable windows work in a modern setting, but he and Somerset will have to make the space inviting and desirable for the people of Holmdel. Most other retail space is about a 10-minute drive away, so Somerset is hoping that Bell Labs can fill a void by becoming a new city center, complemented by 225 new houses that will be build along the outer edge of the property. A massive structure like this was bound to be a massive challenge to anyone brave enough to tackle it, but when finished, the new Bell Labs could be an updated urban center that's enriched by Saarinen's architectural vision.",0.38019993738457425,0.6198000626154258,0.8400133709831786,394,5.2411167512690353,250,6.2000000000000002,0,0,"Design, Architecture"

Slowly but surely, the company, like so many startups, had to learn two lessons and has come to embrace them over time: being creative is difficult to scale, and they'e actually much better engineers than they are artists. A lot of Redwood's clients were looking for ways to understand how their videos were performing and why. They wanted to be able to measure the ROI, return on investment, so they could justify the money being spent on these videos, and craft subsequent videos that would have more impact with their customers. So Redwood began offering its clients a sort of guarantee. We'll help you track how people are watching, and if a certain number of people don't watch through to the end, we'll make your next video for free. As the company got better at helping their clients distribute and analyze what was happening with their videos, they realized the demand for that service was far outstripping demand for them to make new videos.

""At Yahoo, we believe deeply in search – it’s an area of investment, opportunity and growth for us,"" said Mayer. ""I can’t wait to see what innovations we build together."" Google has been Firefox's default browser for ten years, so the new partnership represents a significant break.

Last night, Firefox made a surprising announcement: after 10 years with Google as its default search engine, it would be handing the tiny search bar over to Yahoo. On the face of it, it's a strange move. If you're looking for almost anything on the internet, Google is a much better way to find it than Yahoo is. But that small search bar isn't just a feature, it's a business. And it’s a business that reveals how Mozilla and Google could increasingly be at odds with each other. Suddenly, the short-term money looks like a long-term liability For the last 10 years, Google has had that business almost entirely to itself. Every time you make a search through that bar, Google makes a little bit of money from ads and passes a piece of that money on to the browser through AdSense's revenue sharing deal. That adds up to hundreds of millions of dollars for companies like Mozilla, but the money can produce some strange incentives. Google's making a browser too, and it may not want to support Chrome's competitors forever. Suddenly, the short-term money starts to look like a long-term liability. For Mozilla, that's a frightening prospect — and one that played a big part in yesterday's announcement. When Mozilla CEO Chris Beard explained the decision, he did it under the headline ""Promoting choice and innovation on the web."" Reading between the lines, that means choice in areas where Google is increasingly becoming the default option: browsers and search. For Google, those projects are just part of a larger picture, necessary steps in a seamless ecosystem that's being built across Chrome, Android, and services like Gmail. But that unified platform would leave no place for Mozilla and Yahoo. Smaller projects are already feeling that threat. This January, Google rolled out a technical update to AdSense that killed the ability to mask a user's IP address. For Google, it was a way to crack down on fraud — a minor update — but it shut one privacy project out of Adsense entirely. Epic makes a browser that hides your IP address from the sites you visit. It's not a hugely popular service, but for the program's roughly 10,000 users, it's a useful one. Thanks to the Google search bar, Epic could also make money from its browser, provided it verified user IPs with a third party called Blucora to make sure they were all real people. ""I think their hope is that us and any other browser disappears."" But when Google made its update, the system broke down, and now Epic is left scrambling for a new way to make money. As CEO Alok Bhardwaj told The Verge, ""I think their hope is that us and any other browser disappears."" But without some sort of relationship with Mountain View, it's not clear how Epic and other projects like it can survive. You can still make an IP-masking browser, but you can’t get Google money for the search bar. And in a market full of free -- or rather, AdSense-funded — browsers, that puts privacy-minded users and developers at a serious disadvantage. For Mozilla, Epic's story reads as a warning. We aren't about to see an IP-masking version of Firefox, but there are plenty of other issues like Do Not Track where Mozilla's Free Software ethos might conflict with Google's need for continually smarter and more targeted ads. There's straightforward competitiveness, too: every Firefox user is someone who isn't using Chrome. None of that has bubbled up into outright conflict yet, but it could — and as long as Mozilla is getting a huge chunk of its money from AdSense, it would be at a disadvantage in any fight that arose. If you're looking for other options, Yahoo is a natural choice. There have been rumors that Marissa Mayer wants to restart Yahoo's search business, particularly as the company's partnership with Bing seems less and less binding. When the news broke, Mayer teased future product integrations in the works between the companies, so maybe we'll see more in the months to come, but the most attractive thing about Yahoo may have simply been that it doesn’t run a browser. While Google swallows up everything in its vicinity — laptops, DNS servers, fiber networks — Yahoo's ambitions are a lot less dangerous for a humble browser like Firefox. The big question is, will it be enough? Can Firefox and Yahoo successfully fend off Google's giant ambitions? Will this drive more users to Firefox or just slough them off to Chrome? When Yahoo's new search rolls out in December, will it convince anyone to switch sides? Or will enough users switch their default search back to Google and possibly cut down the money Yahoo is sending Mozilla’s way? It will be a tough fight, but in the end, Mozilla doesn’t have to beat Google — it just has to keep the fight going.",0.6270641507421612,0.37293584925783885,0.19800715951514233,836,4.7822966507177034,443,5.8239277652370207,0,0,"Business, Google"

The defeated plan would have transported 830,000 barrels per day of an oil-based substance called bitumen. Canada has the third-largest oil reserve worldwide, according to a report in The New Yorker. The US imports more oil from Canada than any other nation, and 99 percent of Canadian oil is refined in the U.S. Since 2008, the plan for the pipeline has been met with outcry from environmental groups, ranchers in the American West, and Native American groups, with one South Dakota Sioux tribe declaring the pipeline an ""act of war,"" according to The Guardian.

Its authors call for a halt on oil sand development until both nations determine how best to lower emissions. They're not alone. Many researchers, including former NASA climate scientist James Hansen, have said they consider the pipeline harmful to the environment.

The current outcry is a response to legislation signed into law last week by Indiana governor Mike Pence. Nineteen other states have similar laws on the books, and many more are considering them right now. SalesForce CEO Marc Benioff canceled company events in Indiana, and many other organizations have followed suit. The pushback seems to be having an effect. The governor of Arkansas, Asa Hutchinson, recently said that he would not sign new legislation until it was changed to more clearly prevent discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity  that Cook and these tech leaders are calling out. ""The issue has become divisive because our nation remains split on how to balance the diversity of our culture with the traditions and firmly held religious convictions,"" Hutchinson said.

These values fuel creativity and inspiration, and those in turn make the U.S. technology sector the most admired in the world today. We believe it is critically important to speak out about proposed bills and existing laws that would put the rights of minorities at risk. The transparent and open economy of the future depends on it, and the values of this great nation are at stake. Religious freedom, inclusion, and diversity can co-exist and everyone including LGBT people and people of faith should be protected under their states’ civil rights laws. No person should have to fear losing their job or be denied service or housing because of who they are or whom they love. However, right now those values are being called into question in states across the country. In more than twenty states, legislatures are considering legislation that could empower individuals or businesses to discriminate against LGBT people by denying them service if it they felt it violated their religious beliefs. To ensure no one faces discrimination and ensure everyone preserves their right to live out their faith, we call on all legislatures to add sexual orientation and gender identity as protected classes to their civil rights laws and to explicitly forbid discrimination or denial of services to anyone. Anything less will only serve to place barriers between people, create hurdles to creativity and inclusion, and smother the kind of open and transparent society that is necessary to create the jobs of the future.

And it will avoid taking action against people whose machines are hijacked for botnets or against the ""legitimate cybersecurity research community,"" including people helping companies test and improve cybersecurity. According to the Post, attacks will have to meet one of four criteria: ""attacking critical infrastructure such as a power grid; disrupting major computer networks; stealing intellectual property or trade secrets; or benefiting from the stolen secrets and property."" Obama cited several incidents that have affected American companies. The US has blamed Iran for a series of denial-of-service attacks on banks in 2012, potentially as retaliation for the Stuxnet virus that targeted Iran's nuclear program. Attacks on companies like Target and Home Depot have led to significant leaks of customer payment information. Most notably, North Korea is believed to have orchestrated a crippling attack against Sony in 2014, releasing troves of company data, correspondence, and personal information about employees. The United States already issued sanctions against North Korea in January, targeting the country's intelligence agency, local defense corporations, and a number of individuals. But officials told the Post that the authority for these sanctions wasn't specifically related to cybersecurity. In the future, they said, the new order could allow them to file sanctions against Chinese hackers and state-owned companies that allegedly benefit from stolen trade secrets. Obama promised to focus on cybersecurity in his State of the Union address earlier this year. Among other things, he has outlined an executive order urging companies to share digital threat data and created a centralized cybersecurity agency. Congress is also considering its own legislation for encouraging companies and security agencies to work together against digital threats, resurrecting a bill that has long raised the hackles of privacy advocates.

Given 14 pages of instructions from the judge, seven pages of questions to answer, and a mandate to decide whether Kleiner had been biased in 2012, using performance reviews from 2007 — who knows? I may have arrived at the same decision as the six women and six men who found the venture capital firm not liable. So much about this trial seemed to hinge on whether or not you found Ellen Pao sympathetic, credible, or a crusader. From the gallery in room 602 each day, my worldview changed with each new witness. But in the aftermath of the trial, I've arrived at a handful of discomfiting conclusions. The jury can’t indulge in these kind of hypotheticals, but the best way to determine gender bias is to consider how Pao would have been treated differently if she were a man — not by comparing her to perkier partners, or a co-worker who was nicknamed ""Queen of the Internet"" a decade before she got to Kleiner. The questions on that seven-page jury form focused on the time period after Pao first officially complained about gender bias in December 2011. But Pao’s trajectory toward termination was set in motion much earlier than that. Pao’s trajectory toward termination was set in motion much earlier  During her testimony, Pao described meeting Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey and then bringing Twitter to the attention of senior partner Matt Murphy. This was when the social network had only raised ""one or two rounds of funding,"" so 2007 or 2008. According to Pao, Murphy said ""the team was not business-minded and that we should not spend any more time with them."" Kleiner wouldn’t end up investing in Twitter until 2010, when the party had ended by VC standards. One of the most salient points Pao made on the stand was that women were not able to find sponsors for their investments at Kleiner, and that junior partners couldn’t push an investment through without a sponsor. The distinction between mentorship and sponsorship helped clarify how someone like Pao, who was actively mentored and protected by billionaire John Doerr, still could have been treated unfairly at the firm where Doerr reigned. Figuring out who ""sourced"" an investment is admittedly tricky. But what if Pao had been sponsored to invest in Twitter? Credit for calling it early may have made her sought out by other investors or considered a ""thought leader"" in mobile development, both qualities dependent on the perception of others. In the closing arguments, Pao’s lawyers compared her to Chi-Hua Chien, a male partner who, like Pao, was called aggressive and arrogant. Kleiner considered Twitter a win for Chien when he led the firm’s investment in it in 2010. Here’s a video of Chien talking about meeting Dorsey during the company’s first round of funding. ""It totally made no sense. I didn’t invest in that round, unfortunately,"" he said with a laugh. Chien’s arc as an investor began when he was an associate at another Silicon Valley firm, Accel Partners. An associate is equivalent to junior partner at Kleiner — Pao’s position — but Chien is still credited for sourcing Accel’s windfall investment in Facebook. This hypothetical would not change Pao’s odds of getting terminated in 2012. Pao’s complaint mentioned that three men were promoted instead of her. During Kleiner’s downsizing, brought about in part because the firm hadn't seen the consumer internet / social networking revolution coming, two of those men were ""transitioned out,"" including Chien. I think if Pao were a man, Kleiner might not have been as dismissive when she brought up Twitter. I think if she were a man, she would still have been fired as part of Kleiner's cutbacks. We always knew this jury would be fastidious, especially under the supervision of Judge Harold Kahn, a legal history buff who got the entire courtroom amped about the 800th anniversary of the Magna Carta. Judge Kahn is the kind of Atticus Finch character whose ideals you want to live up to. He allowed the jury to ask questions after every witness, and they cut through all the testimony with a scalpel. In interviews after the verdict was recorded, the few jurors who would speak publicly about the tense month-long trial said deliberations hung on the evidence, describing a small room papered in performance reviews and old emails. They asked perceptive questions. Minutes after the verdict was read, the youngest of the 12 called it ""one of the most difficult decisions I have ever made."" He had voted no on all claims. ""Like I said, it was based on the evidence that was admitted, the testimony, almost irrespective of the lawyers argument."" ""It was based on the evidence that was admitted, the testimony, almost irrespective of the lawyers argument."" And yet even those who sided with Kleiner wanted to see the firm ""punished,"" believed Kleiner’s culture was lawless, and agreed that venture capital's gender imbalance was ""appalling."" The discrepancy between jurors’ beliefs and their verdict emerged not just because subtle sexism is hard to prove, but because it wasn’t even on their menu. Jurors were not asked if saying women ""kill the buzz"" created an uneven playing field; they weren’t even asked about the field. Questions on the jury form centered on why Pao was not promoted, after years of strife between her and senior management. The jury was not voting on whether the financiers of the future should only be 6 percent female. Juror Steve Sammut, who works in sales for the Godfrey Group, spoke in front of the TV cameras in the ad-hoc briefing room. Someone asked if there was ""much talk of the broader significance of what you were deciding in there."" Before the reporter could finish his sentence, Sammut shook his head no. ""Not at all, we never discussed that,"" he said. The jury ""never talked about"" how the decision might affect ""the venture capital world or Silicon Valley in general."" While the jury pushed the larger context out of their minds, observers inflated the trial’s symbolism. Pao, the interim CEO of Reddit with an MBA and JD from Harvard, came to represent all women in tech. Venture capitalists came to symbolize the tech companies they invest in. Kleiner Perkins — a firm where apprentices need two graduate degrees  — became synonymous with the venture capital industry, even though nowadays VCs are more likely to tweetstorm for deal flow, and blogging is an acceptable resume for the job. In the retelling, Kleiner was depicted as one more tech office besieged by brogrammer culture, instead of the old boys' club that it is, with the ""throwback sexism"" to prove it. In reality, John Doerr is the guy who has President Obama over for dinner — he’s not the brogrammer in a hoodie pricing you out of the Mission. John Doerr is not the brogrammer in a hoodie pricing you out of the Mission ""I think no one really gets it. There are very few people who get to ascend and make the real dollars,"" said one tech investor, who requested anonymity. ""VC at the big shops is country club shit."" At larger firms like Kleiner, ""success is really about who is allowed to capture the moment,"" the investor added, ""And the VC firms just choose who gets these opportunities to be lucky and part of the cycle."" ""You get chosen based on personality and investing, but it’s just so murky,"" the investor said. ""People do better and better when put in good circumstances."" The flip side is that junior partners perform worse as their opportunities are constricted. That’s what seems to have happened to Ellen Pao. The more they shut her out, the more she complained, breaking rule one for female venture capitalists. By making the trial so emblematic, some observers started to distract from the facts of the case, which showed just how backwards these money men can be. Kleiner has invested in Uber, Nest, Dropcam, Waze, and Snapchat, but I was shocked with all this clubbiness that no one mentioned golf. Instead we heard about private planes, dinners at Al Gore’s house, and multi-million-dollar salaries. It’s not just that they look for ""white, male nerds who've dropped out of Harvard or Stanford,"" to use Doerr’s words; it’s also the type of suits that are looking (mostly in their own backyard). What a strange dynamic to have mostly middle-aged white males investing in mostly 20-something white males, like a patronage system. Once the dust settled on all those ""not liables,"" Kleiner attorney Lynne Hermle took a victory lap in the press. Hermle is a charmer, but she knows where the bodies are buried (including some she may have buried herself). ""This is the right issue and the right time, but the wrong case,"" Hermle told The Recorder. There were typically three women pushing that playbook She could have stolen that line from the Kleiner Perkins playbook. There were typically three women pushing that playbook in and around the San Francisco Superior Court at all times: the firm’s marketing partner and two outside reps from the Brunswick PR agency, who could often be seen flanking reporters in the hallways and were quick with an angry phone call after hours. The highly coordinated PR campaign, which Pao didn't even attempt to match, likely shaded some trial coverage in Kleiner's favor. Kleiner’s financial advantage could be seen in other ways as well. One of the sadder moments of the trial was when Pao’s attorney Therese Lawless said she couldn’t afford transcripts of her own case. ""In the old days,"" the court reporter’s fees would be taken care of by the court, Lawless told me hours before the verdict. For the trial, the plaintiff and the defense split the cost of the court reporter, but each side still has to pay for transcripts. ""That's why you see us taking furious notes,"" said Lawless. ""Then I went on blogs and read some stuff. They're taking better notes than me!"" Pao’s lawyers, Lawless and Alan Exelrod, had a few bits of damning data that they weren’t able to pin on Kleiner, often because of some very convenient ""could not recall’s"". The plaintiff wanted to show that there was a concrete ceiling at the firm, even for uber-qualified women. They were hoping to do this by pointing out that neither Mary Meeker nor Beth Seidenberg — both brand names in their field — were partners in the management LLC that sits on top of Kleiner. On the witness stand, however, both Meeker and Seidenberg both convincingly testified that they had no interest in being part of that core group of decision makers. Since the trial, a number of women who work in venture capital have spoken out about the issues Pao raised. The New York Times profiled ""female-run venture capital funds,"" though some of the firms mentioned function more like angel investors, who have less capital to work with. Female investors who strike out on their own have access to less capital Angels put up their own money, whereas venture capitalists are funded by limited partners, typically institutional investors like universities or pension funds. Angels invest in the early stages, whereas VCs can plunk hundreds of millions of dollars into companies that are more established. When Doerr’s partners argued that Ellen Pao should be pushed into an operating role because she didn’t have what it took to be an investor, he offered to invest if she started her own fund. Kleiner invested in former partner Aileen Lee’s firm, Cowboy Ventures, as well, to give you some sense of the relative size. Relegating women to smaller-scale investing roles appears to be less of a threat to the status quo. A common response to dismissing complaints about bias is that there’s no way the powers that be would operate against their own financial interests. But they do this all the time!

I can change, and I will change, the voice of Takei commands Bojack through a self-help audiobook. You've gotta conquer that hill. The hill is a metaphor. Everything is a metaphor. You are literally a metaphor. Bojack is a metaphor — most of the show's characters are — and that's one of the reasons it's so unique. Of course, when I first heard about Bojack Horseman, I dismissed it. After being let down so many times by shows that tried to exploit Will Arnett's Arrested Development id, I just didn't see how replacing his body with a cartoon animal could make the same gag remotely watchable. But Bojack was a Trojan horse that forded the moat to my heart with cute animal puns, and then unleashed its depressive soul all over my feelings.  It's an artful balance — profound sadness cloaked in incisive humor — that has made Bojack so compelling. Above all, it's a story about genuine depression: the relentless cycle of self-sabotage that produces universal alienation. In the first season, Bojack slowly evolves from a hopeless narcissistic has-been — so stuck in the past that he literally can't climax without watching himself in reruns of his hit '90s show, Horsin' Around — to a hopeless narcissistic has-been who starts to recognize his self-destructive patterns while coping with brutal rejection and the feeling that he's an impostor. Bojack's struggle is such an authentic portrayal of depression that it cut to my core. So it's really sad that the second season mostly squanders the authenticity it established in the first. Bojack Horseman is a story about genuine depression Bojack's weird assortment of animal gags and metaphor work because they're all entangled with the very real pathos of its characters, but in season two, they all too often become mere puns. One aimless caper sees Bojack's roommate Todd (Aaron Paul, as the least interesting iteration of Jesse Pinkman yet) attempt to rescue an escaped chicken that is destined for a slaughterhouse. (She's named ""Becca,"" which sounds like ""ba-gok,"" get it?) The chicken's predicament as a food object plays on the show's ambiguous cohabitation of animals and humans, but it lacks any kind of character motivation and consumes nearly an entire episode. It's too bad, because it ends up burying far subtler moments. Far less time is given to a great storyline about Bojack's counterpart, an actor named Mr. Peanut Butter (a dog voiced by Paul F. Tompkins). Mr. Peanut Butter is an utterly obedient doofus who loves everyone around him, and in one of seasons two's best moments, he tells his wife Diane (a human voiced by Alison Brie) how unbelievably excited he gets when he waits for her all day and then hears her car pulling into the driveway. You know, like a dog. And like a person! That metaphor — literal codependent dog is needy human — is only effective when it tugs at a really personal thread, and it does. Mr. Peanut Butter and Diane struggle with realistic portrayals of distrust, vulnerability, and anxiety. Of course, lots of shows do this capably, but none with a dog asking his wife to rub his chin so he remembers things.   A beating heart isn't all Bojack has going for it — it's also vigorously weirder than anything I've seen. But this season is inconsistent in its commitment to that weirdness. A running gag in the first season begins when Bojack's agent and ex-girlfriend, Princess Caroline (a cat voiced by Amy Sedaris), begins revenge-dating ""Vincent Adultman"" — a character who appears to be three human children stacked inside of a trench coat with a broom for an arm. Bojack insists to Princess Caroline that Vincent is, very obviously, three children inside of a trench coat. But as the joke goes on and on, it becomes less clear whether or not that's just Bojack's envious delusion. We feel as alienated as Bojack does, and it's exactly the kind of sad-funny-absurd tension that makes the show work... until the second season, when the writers inexplicably ruin the gag. I haven't felt so betrayed by writers since Emma Stone watched Michael Keaton fly out of a window at the conclusion of Birdman. ""After you get famous you stop growing, because you don't have to."" Early on in the second season, Bojack's director — he's landed his dream role playing the lead horse in Secretariat — counsels Diane on his stagnation. ""After you get famous, you stop growing, because you don't have to,"" she says. It felt like she was talking to me, but about the second season of Bojack Horseman (at least, the first six episodes I received from Netflix). It seems like the writers decided to cash in on aimless jokes that, while still clever, were ultimately self-indulgent and distracting. Netflix made me care about a talking horse, and then it stopped talking about the horse. Instead, it started talking about the horse's lame human roommate. I was really hopeful that Bojack Horseman would continue to be one of the best shows on television (or the internet). It was definitely one whose return I was most looking forward to this year — if only because there are few shows that manage to be so genuinely sad and weird at the same time. But most of that sadness lies in its main character, and with everything else going on, he's now forced to take a back seat, despite what Netflix's Horseman-centric trailer would indicate. It's not too late to make me care again, but Bojack needs to take care of itself first.

The Swedish indie studio is best known for the 2011 game Amnesia: The Dark Descent, but it’s also just synonymous with a specific kind of survival horror. Frictional games don’t have weapons. They’re slightly clumsy. They keep monsters in the corner of your eye until it’s too late. And they usually involve a whole lot of Lovecraft — not your basic Cthulhu-and-Necronomicon pastiche, but stories about men and women of science facing entities beyond their comprehension. Frictional’s new game Soma, coming this fall, is most of those things. It feels slightly like a callback to the Penumbra series that Frictional published throughout the late ‘00s, but set in a creepy, abandoned underwater lab instead of a creepy, abandoned underground mine. Based on a roughly 3-hour preview, though, it might also be the studio’s most mature and sophisticated game yet.   A play-by-play walkthrough of Soma doesn’t sound all that original. Enter a room, read a thing, flip a switch or switch-like object, maybe flip another switch to activate that switch, go to a new room, and run away screaming if something tries to kill you. But that doesn’t capture how well it’s negotiated the balance between ""walking game"" and ""adventure game."" Soma’s demo doesn’t have physics puzzles or sequences of picking up and combining objects. Its kind of stripped-down gameplay is exactly what I didn’t like about Frictional’s last game, Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs — at the time, it seemed to lower the stakes and encourage linearity. In Soma, it lets the environment itself become the puzzle. Soma rejects the idea that exploration games can't have challenges My tastes have probably shifted a little, but Soma also just seems more comfortable in its own quasi-walk-em-up skin. Set at the bottom of the Atlantic, the demo alternates between labyrinthine gunmetal corridors and the empty ocean floor, between bloodstained grating and the bright, encroaching flora and fauna of the sea. With virtually no interface or items to pick up, half the difficulty involves figuring out where you are and where you need to be, then getting there without alerting one of the eerie, robot-like creatures that appear to be the station’s last remaining inhabitants. Instead of accepting the dichotomy between exploration and challenge, Soma just turns up the pressure, until you almost wish you could take a break to stack boxes and mix chemicals. There are a few stumbles that break the flow by seeming too scripted, and Frictional games have a history of getting less scary once you become familiar enough with their monsters. But it largely captures the perfect feeling of being incredibly curious about where you’ve ended up while wanting desperately to get out of there. The setting, a mysterious facility known as Pathos-2, is full of hints that something terrible has happened. But you’ll also see rough sketches, annoyed notes, and books or postcards that belonged to the old crew. It’s more physical and detailed than Frictional’s previous games — it almost feels influenced by Gone Home, which ironically started as a mod of Amnesia.   What it notably doesn’t feel like is similarly watery horror game BioShock. BioShock’s retro-futuristic stylings were, in their way, very cynical. It’s a series where having ideals usually leads to moral ruin, and the city of the future is built on a cracked and shoddy foundation. Soma’s straightforward ""abandoned experimental site"" premise, by contrast, quickly segues into a complex science fiction story that’s tragic but strangely hopeful. Both Amnesia games had grotesque third-act revelations, and Soma might be no exception. But the demo’s horror comes not from the darkness in humankind so much as the feeling that you’re facing something absolutely alien. That includes whatever created the fleshy barnacles and lumbering monsters in Pathos-2, but it’s also the ocean itself, which might be the most frightening Great Old One of all. Frictional has tapped into the primal fear of our planet’s last unmapped frontiers, a place where life works by different rules and even the thickest glass and metal can’t erase our vulnerability. In this case, there just happen to be even bigger forces at play — and a plot twist that I really, really want to reveal but can’t. Which means that I also can’t wait for everyone else to play it. Just, no matter what the game tells you, keep the lights on when you do.

This time around, it's Pebbles Interfaces, a five-year-old Israeli company working on high-definition hand-tracking technology. ""Pebbles Interfaces will be joining the hardware engineering and computer vision teams at Oculus to help advance virtual reality, tracking, and human-computer interactions,"" says Oculus in a blog post. It's not confirming any further terms of the deal, but a spokesperson said that the group would be moving to Oculus' main campus in Menlo Park, California. On a very basic level, Pebbles' hardware is similar to the Leap Motion controller. In a Geektime interview from May, the company's marketing manager suggested that it improved on Leap by creating an actual model of a user's hand, not just mapping the motion onto an avatar. It can also provide details about the environment using its depth sensor. Oculus embedded a Pebbles video from May that shows off the technology:  This demo is, relatively speaking, extremely precise. One of the biggest problems with hand-tracking hardware is that it often breaks down the moment your hands get too close to each other (no cracking your knuckles in VR), something that's almost totally absent in this video. That said, a video lets developers clip out any flaws, and we haven't tried it ourselves. This is at least the fifth company that Oculus has bought since being acquired by Facebook in March 2014, and it's the fourth dedicated to mapping real-world objects. It was preceded by Nimble VR and 13th Lab in December, then by Surreal Vision, which was acquired in May. All these companies do slightly different things, but together they focus on both tracking hands and developing a model of objects and spaces around a subject. When the Oculus Rift ships in early 2016, it will be with an Xbox One gamepad, but Oculus has also said that it's got a research group looking at long-term VR interface design. It showed off a prototype motion controller called the Touch (seen above) at E3 last month. At that point, CEO Brendan Iribe seemed unenthusiastic about the idea of pure hand tracking, saying that players wanted something physical to grasp. But the Touch has a rudimentary system that recognizes where your thumb and forefinger are, and Oculus seems to be focusing on the very long game of VR design. And signs point to the idea that understanding a player's surroundings and physical body will be very, very important.",0.6049653691265521,0.3950346308734479,0.2516093445900298,411,5.0632603406326036,266,5.9661654135338349,0,0,"Culture, Entertainment, Gaming"

The changes are broadly designed to make Firefox more secure and stable, but they also have the downside of making it less customizable and potentially more of a resource hog.  ""Developers who already support Chrome extensions will benefit."" There are a few key changes that Mozilla is making to get there. The first is that it's changing how extensions (which Firefox calls ""add-ons"") connect to the browser. Mozilla is beginning to require that they use a new method that's very similar to what's used by Chrome and Opera. While that means Firefox extensions may need to be rebuilt, it'll mean that Chrome and Opera extensions should be able to add Firefox support with minimal changes. ""Developers who already support Chrome extensions will benefit since they will have one codebase to support instead of two,"" Mozilla writes in a blog post. Mozilla is also beginning to require that all extensions go through a security check before they can be installed (currently, only extensions that are submitted to Mozilla's official add-ons gallery go through these checks). While there will be some way to get around this — mostly for developers — this means that every extension that the average person installs will have to pass through Mozilla. For the most part, that's going to be a good thing. ""Extensions that change the homepage and search settings without user consent have become very common, just like extensions that inject advertisements into web pages or even inject malicious scripts into social media sites,"" Mozilla wrote earlier this year. There are obviously some huge security issues in letting extensions run through a web browser unchecked, and Mozilla is beginning to change that. Mozilla is trying to make Firefox more stable and secure The other updates relate to changing technologies inside of Firefox itself. For one, Firefox's behind-the-scenes tab management is soon going to work a lot more like the way Chrome handles tabs. Rather than running the browser and web content all together, Chrome splits them up so that the browser frame is separate from each individual browsing tab. It means that if one tab crashes, everything else can keep moving just fine, rather than the entire browser going down with it. There are also some security enhancements that come with tabs being kept independent of each other. This is essentially the model that Firefox is moving over to. At first, Mozilla will simply be separating the browser and the web content into two items, but over time it sounds like the plan is to break apart each tab. That might lead to some of the resource issues that Chrome has, but there's a good argument to be made that it's a fair trade-off for stability and security. Finally, Mozilla is changing some of the underlying technology that it uses to build Firefox. That result is that extension developers aren't going to be able to alter the browser in quite as deep of a way. That's going to be a disappointment for some, but it's certainly not a reason for immediate outrage: Firefox has long been far more customizable than other browsers, but it was customizable in a way that could pose security and stability issues. Currently, ""add-ons have complete access to Firefox’s internal implementation"" of core technologies, Mozilla writes. That's apparently also led to development slow downs, which Mozilla hopes to avoid by changing what extensions are capable of. These changes are going to be rolling out over the next year or so, with some starting much sooner. Extensions are going to have to be approved starting with Firefox 42, which comes two versions from now. Firefox 43 is supposed to begin separating the browser itself from the content inside its tabs; the deeper changes will come about around 12 to 18 months from now. It's likely that that's when developers will have to switch over to the new method of making extensions.",0.4667591173642024,0.5332408826357976,0.1759551161595542,674,4.9762611275964392,332,5.7921686746987948,0,0,"Apps, Tech"

We're totally blowing up our site: we've given our reporters and editors the entire week to play with new tools and experiment with new storytelling ideas, while members of our amazing product team have gathered in New York to help build all sorts of interesting new things. Learn more. Notifications are the best and worst thing about phones, pulling you into a world of feeds, updates, and real-time data — whether you want to be pulled in or not. But while it's easy to be overnotified, keeping a good balance of peace and connectivity is much trickier. Some of it is corporate thirst, apps that simply don't know when to stop demanding your attention. (I'm looking at you, Periscope.) But just as often, the flood of pings comes because you haven't drawn a line between what you need to know and what you don't.So in the spirit of Hack Week, we decided to run a little experiment. For a full day, we invited Verge staffers to log every notification that came into their phones, from Timehops to Twitter favs to plain old phone calls. (As it turned out, there was only one of those.) As you might expect, email was by far the biggest noise polluter, but social apps like Twitter and Instagram turned out to be pretty alarm-happy too. Here's the breakdown:  A few quick notes on this data. We're big on work apps at The Verge, as you might expect, so the ""Office"" section mostly refers to Trello and Slack. And even though all the social networks are all lumped together, Twitter is by far the thirstiest, accounting for more than 80 percent of the social network notifications. Maybe it's because we're all in media? But the big question is how individual people keep their phones in check, so we've broken out three individual staffers below.  Nearly everyone agrees you should keep your phone notifications to a manageable minimum — and I thought I was doing that. I've turned off email push notifications entirely (when was the last time you went 10 minutes without checking your email?) and for the most part, haven't missed them. Then I saw how many more notifications I receive each day than my co-workers. The biggest offender for me is Tweetbot, which I encourage to send me every favorite, follow, and retweet. It's a daily drip of affirmation, and makes life on this garbage planet just a bit more bearable. But I get notifications from lots of other places, too: at least 75 apps have sent me a push in the last month. Most of those bother me less than once a day — Dark Sky, for example, only pops up when it's about to rain. But many of these apps are more frequent pests. It's an effect of so many apps building in social and messaging layers. On one hand, writing about social and messaging apps is what I do, so I'm an outlier. But you don't have to be an app freak to have Snapchat, Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, Hangouts, Skype, and iMessage on your phone. Keeping up with your friends today requires more notifications than ever before. —Casey Newton  I've never really taken the time to prune the notifications on my phone. I treat it in a very binary way: most apps' notifications are left on, except for the few (like Periscope) that can be incessant. Beyond that, I enforce very little control over them. I'm always worried I'll miss something, so I'd rather suffer the annoyance and dismiss the ones I don't care about than restrict the flow too much. With that in mind, it still feels like there are long enough stretches of my day where the notifications either don't come fast enough that I assumed the total number wasn't that high. When I took the time to count them this week, I realized it was even higher than I had imagined. In fact it got to be such a distraction that I had to stop counting in real time and sort of take a stab at guessing how many were coming in. Worse, I couldn't just go back and look at the notifications I'd missed because the notifications experience on iOS is still quite messy. The notifications panel at the top of the OS limits the amount you can see at any given time, and you have no option to search or sort through them. The saving grace for me is my Pebble Time. It's where I observe most of my alerts, and it lets me quickly weigh whether an incoming notification is important enough for me to bother taking my phone out of my pocket. From here on out, though, maybe I'll turn a few more of them off. —Sean O'Kane  My notification strategy is something I’ve spent countless hours upon. I use all the tools available to keep notifications as finely honed as possible. Hell, I even forced myself to climb up and over the Google Inbox learning curve because of the awesome control it gives me over email alerts. Still, it only took one day of quantified awareness to shatter any confidence I had in my setup. Sixty-three notifications on my phone is way too many for a day when I was trying to focus and write. Sixty-three interruptions over a period of about 10 hours, or more than one every 10 minutes, on average. And that’s just my phone. (We didn’t tally the notifications coming in on other devices like smartwatches, tablets, or laptops.) I’ve grown accustomed to the interruptions — it’s normal. But normal shouldn’t be confused with acceptable. And now that I’ve paid attention, it’s very clear that I, and the industry, have a long way to go when it comes to filtering the nonessential. —Thomas Ricker",0.374543074135961,0.625456925864039,0.1786758602453549,989,4.5813953488372094,506,5.6679841897233203,0,0,"Apps, Mobile, Tech, Verge Hack Week 2015"

The ""quasi-generic"" drug could be the first step towards shrinking the US's $375 billion in yearly drug spending. The generic drug, called Zarxio, is made by Novartis. It's a copycat version of Neupogen, an injectable treatment made by Amgen used to help prevent infections in patients undergoing chemotherapy. Unlike most pharmaceuticals, biotech drugs are created in living cells, which makes regenerating them a challenge. A daily dose of Neupogen can cost anywhere from $315 to $500, and many patients need to take multiple doses per week, WSJ reports. Biotech drugs are some of the most expensive in the world The copycat drugs are called ""biosimilars,"" because they aren't exact replicas of brand-name biotech drugs. In some states, doctors cannot switch a patient who is already taking a name-brand biotech to a biosimilar version of it, according to the Associated Press. The FDA released regulatory guidelines for biosimilars in 2012. Because the proteins used in biotech drugs are larger and more complex than those used in small molecule pills, the FDA may need to expand regulations as the drugs enter the market. Biotech drugs are produced by genetically modified organisms, and even slight changes in how they are grown can affect the properties of the proteins produced. The US health system puts an estimated $82 billion towards biotech drug spending annually. A cheaper version of a biotech drug could help curb the costs of medical treatments, but these drugs are still some of the most expensive in the world. There's no promise Zarxio will be significantly cheaper than its counterpart. US sales of Neupogen alone reached $839 million last year, according to AP. Novartis won't disclose the cost of Zarxio until it's commercially available, but it told WSJ the drug would be ""competitively priced."" Generic biotech drugs have been available in Europe since 2006, and AP reports the copies are usually 20 to 30 percent cheaper than their counterparts. Generic versions of typical drugs often sell for 90 percent less than brand-name drugs. ""I don’t think it’s going to be an overnight sensation."" Gary Lyman, an oncologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center told WSJ. ""I think oncologists are going to have to gain from experience that [biosimilars] are safe, they’re efficacious, and patient convenience and quality of life is maintained."" The copy could be commercially available in a matter of weeks Amgen has asked a federal judge in California to block the sale of Zarxio, claiming the product doesn't meet regulatory standards.

A new method for imaging HIV in living macaques is described today in Nature Methods, a feat that had not been previously achieved in large, living animals. The finding is a big deal, because it means that researchers might one day be able to see — and selectively target — breeding grounds of HIV in people whose infection is undetectable in blood. ""revolutionary for the field of HIV therapeutics."" If you want to detect HIV in humans, blood is your friend. Unfortunately, the virus levels found in blood aren’t representative of the entire body because replication takes place in the cells located in tissues, not in blood. So, even though blood tests are perfectly adequate for detecting HIV in most people, they don’t always work. People on antiretrovirals sometimes have HIV levels that are so low that doctors can’t detect the virus in the bloodstream. In those cases, HIV continues to replicate in patients' organs, which limits doctors' ability to totally suppress the virus. Doctors could get around that issue by repeatedly sampling tissues at random and testing them for HIV replication — but doing that would seriously endanger their patients. So, doctors are left with blood tests — and a bunch of unanswered questions. That’s why designing an imaging technique that can detect hidden pockets of HIV replication without doing anything too invasive is so important; it’s the missing methodological step that could help us figure out where HIV hides out in the body, and why it’s so damn persistent. ""Total body imaging of sites of viral infections… will be revolutionary for the field of HIV therapeutics,"" — especially for therapies that focus on virus eradication and HIV remission, says Deborah Persaud, an HIV researcher at Johns Hopkins University who didn’t participate in the study. The images show HIV ""hotspots"" where the virus is making copies of itself In the study, researchers engineered a tracer labelled with radioactive copper that selectively attaches to a protein that’s only expressed on the surface of cells that produce HIV. Then, the researchers injected the tracer in macaques infected with SIV, the monkey form of HIV. They did the same thing with monkeys who had been on antiretrovirals for five weeks, and whose virus was undetectable. Approximately one day later, the researchers put the monkeys through a machine called a PET scan that can detect the low-level radioactivity coming from the tracer. The resulting images show HIV ""hotspots"" where the virus is making copies of itself — areas that researchers might one day be able to target therapeutically.   Results for an SIV-infected rhesus macaque (left) and an uninfected macaque (right). Credit: Santangelo et al., 2015 ""We can find SIV activity in different organs,"" says Francois Villinger, a pathologist at Emory University and a co-author of the study. ""And what’s especially interesting is that the signal is not uniform across organs; for example in the gastrointestinal tract, we found wide variability of signals."" This means that small tissue samples that researchers sometimes take from animals infected with HIV might not be representative of the entire organ’s HIV replication levels, Villinger explains. ""This is something that’s difficult to accept for some members in the field."" Some scientists think that antiretroviral drugs should penetrate all parts of an organ equally, in which case the organ should be equally infected throughout. But ""that doesn’t seem to be so,"" he says. The researchers were also surprised to find important pockets of replication in the nose — in addition to signals in expected areas of replication like the gastrointestinal tract, the genital tract, and the lungs. ""I don’t think it plays a role in transmission, but it’s interesting,"" Villinger says. ""We found signals [in locations] that nobody has paid attention to."" The nose probably doesn't play a role in transmission, ""but it’s interesting.""  The technique isn’t as sensitive as the researchers would like it to be. The tracer can still be detected organs that don’t experience replication because it’s in the process of being eliminated by these tissues. To get rid of these ""background signals,"" the researchers injected non-HIV infected monkeys with the [tracer], and imaged them as well. Then, they subtracted their signals from those detected in HIV injected macaques. It worked out pretty well, Villinger says. But this correction isn’t ideal, as it might still lead to false positives, says Mathias Lichterfeld an HIV researcher at Harvard University who didn’t participate in the study. The researchers may be able to improve the sensitivity of the image by fiddling with the tracer — a crucial step in ""getting the technique to a point where it can be used in humans,"" Lichterfeld says. Making the images more precise will also help the researchers image infected animals without using uninfected animals to exclude background effects. The images also fall short when it comes to the brain. The tracer doesn’t penetrate the ""blood-brain-barrier""— a selectively permeable barrier that separates the body’s blood from the central nervous system. As a result, the images don’t show viral replication in the brain, even though it’s probably taking place there too. This is unfortunate because a method that can detect replication in the central nervous system ""is critically needed,"" Persaud says. the technique might not work in children who have been ""functionally cured"" of HIV There’s one last issue with the method devised by Villinger’s team: it probably can’t detect latent HIV reservoirs, meaning pockets of HIV where replication doesn’t take place. This is a rare occurrence, but it does happen. In 2013, doctors announced that treating a baby with antiretrovirals right after birth had ""functionally cured"" the child of HIV; the virus remained undetectable after the child was taken off the drugs. Unfortunately, the virus returned a year later. And unfortunately, the protein to which the tracer binds isn't expressed in latent HIV reservoirs, Persaud says. Little known about what happens in the first two weeks after infection  Now that the study has been published, Villinger and his team of researchers want to tweak the tracer to make the images more accurate. They also want to see if they can detect differences in HIV progression in animals infected intravenously — a model of infection through injection drug use — and animals infected through tissues in the genital tract. They would also like to measure signals in animals that have been on antiretrovirals therapy for longer periods, as well in animals that have been taken off antiretroviral therapy to see what happens as HIV replication is ""rekindled."" Villinger and his team have also started to look at what happens in the first two weeks of infection; scientists don't know much about that, he says. Finally, the scientists plan to try the method on humans — something that could happen in the next five years, Villinger says. Being able to see reservoirs of HIV replication in living animals is a big deal. The system needs to be fine-tuned, and tested for safety, but if there’s progress, it would one day lead to a tool for monitoring the effectiveness of antiretroviral therapies, Villinger says. And in the meantime, it may give researchers a better idea of how HIV re-ignites in the body.  ""In my mind that might be the most important asset we can use this technology for,"" Villinger says. ""It’s really trying to better define what happens where — and that’s really critical as we move forward in medicine.""",0.6452499300463328,0.3547500699536672,0.7838626279156654,1277,5.1855912294440092,548,6.4270072992700733,0,2,"Science, Report"

Kristina Trotta, a former DEP employee, said that her regional administrator told her and her colleagues that they were no longer allowed to use the terms in 2011. Officials were reportedly told that sea-level rise was to be euphemistically referred to as ""nuisance flooding."" Spokespeople for the DEP and the governor's office said that there was no policy on the use of the terms, but four former officials told the FCIR that the unwritten order was well known and distributed verbally statewide. Officials were reportedly warned against using the terms in reports in case they ""would bring unwanted attention to their projects,"" and were told not to reference anything that ""was not a true fact"" in economic reports, educational materials, and environmental reports that were used to set energy and business policies. The department says there is no policy on the use of the terms The FCIR said the unwritten directive came into effect after Scott came into office in 2011 and appointed Herschel Vinyard Jr. as the DEP's director. Christopher Byrd, an attorney who worked for the DEP's Office of General Counsel from 2008 to 2013, said that the message had been communicated by his superiors.

Governor Scott has not confirmed he believes in man-made climate change The US Senate has overwhelmingly agreed that climate change is real, but speaking in 2011, Rick Scott said he had yet to be convinced that humans had anything to do with it. He deflected the matter in May 2014, saying ""I'm not a scientist"" in response questions about his stance on climate change, six months before he earned a second term as the state's governor. Scott invited environmental scientists to talk on the topic in 2014, but the experts complained that he used 10 minutes of the allotted 30-minute session to offer extended introductions. Climate experts have agreed that Florida would be hit particularly hard by severe changes in Earth's climate and sea level. The 2014 national climate assessment for the US said that the state was at risk of an ""imminent threat of increased inland flooding"" and was ""uniquely vulnerable to sea-level rise"" — the kind of ""nuisance flooding"" that could wash cities like the low-lying Miami off the map.",0.4921959034968542,0.5078040965031458,0.8755532486585155,452,5.1415929203539825,251,6.2988047808764938,0,0,"Policy & Law, Science, US & World"

The findings suggest that similar techniques could one day be used to treat conditions like post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in humans, though major hurdles remain. The study, published in the journal Nature Neuroscience, involved five mice that were placed within an enclosed circular space. Researchers used electrical brain implants to create a ""reward"" sensation in the mice whenever they thought about a specific area of the space during sleep. When they woke up and returned to the space, they went immediately to the area associated with the reward, suggesting that an artificial memory had been formed.   ""Learning during sleep has always been a dream."" Previous studies have demonstrated that memories can be both created and manipulated in mice, but the findings published today are the first to show that this can be done during sleep, adding a new wrinkle to the long history of sleep-learning experiments. ""Learning during sleep has always been a dream — no joke intended,"" says Karim Benchenane, a researcher at the Centre National de la recherche scientifique and one of the study’s co-authors. He notes that in this study, the area of the circular space was never associated with a reward while the mice were awake, meaning that ""the only way they could learn is during sleep."" A dozen mice were fitted with electrical implants and placed in a circular, one-meter-wide place, according to the study. The electrical implants allowed the authors to identify the specific brain cells that were activated when the mice entered a particular area of the space. Not just that, though — for five of the mice, the implants automatically stimulated the reward pathways of their brains whenever the cells spiked during sleep. The activated cells are known as place cells because they create a cognitive map of physical spaces, acting as a sort of GPS for the brain. When the mice awoke after receiving the ""reward"" stimulation and entered the same space, they immediately went to the location associated with the reward. They also spent more than four times longer there than they did the first time they explored the space. Another group of five mice demonstrated similar behavior after receiving the stimulation while they were awake. The other two received no stimulation at all, and demonstrated no association with the reward placement. ""something we've all believed, but which has not really been proven."" The findings mark an important development for the study of spatial memory, as well. Place cells were first identified in 1971 by John O’Keefe, who was honored for his discovery with last year's Nobel Prize in Medicine. It's been widely assumed that place cells reactivate during sleep as a way to consolidate an animal’s memory of certain environments. Today's study is the first to demonstrate this phenomenon in action, proving that when activated during sleep, place cells convey the same spatial information they do when animals are awake. ""It now provides a really clear demonstration of something we've all believed, but which has not really been proven,"" says Kate Jeffery, a professor of behavioral neuroscience at University College London who was not involved in the study. ""Now we know that that’s really the case."" Benchenane acknowledges that the study’s sample size is small, though the complexity of the task involved — going to a specific area of a relatively large pen — all but eliminates the possibility that his team's results are due to chance, he says. Findings may have implications for PTSD sufferers One implication of the study may bring hope to PTSD sufferers, says Benchenane, who also heads the Memory, Oscillation and Brain States team at the Ecole Supérieure de Physique et de Chimie Industrielles (EPSCI) in Paris. People with PTSD often feel fearful and stressed, after a traumatic event changes their flight-or-fight response. Though it’s popularly associated with war, it can also be triggered by other events, including muggings, rapes, and natural disasters, according to the US National Institute of Mental Health. But if scientists can manipulate traumatic memories during sleep, it may be possible to make them less harmful to people, perhaps by manipulating traumatic memories while patients sleep so they aren't quite so bad. But that would require a precise and less invasive method of recording neural activity, which doesn’t exist today. ""Now that we’re more sure that memories are being reactivated after they’re formed, and that you can change them, there’s the possibility that we can use that in a therapeutic setting,"" Jeffery says. ""But obviously we’re not going to be sticking electrodes in the median forebrain bundles of humans, so maybe we can do it another way."" Ideally, scientists would be able to identify the precise moment a person thinks of a traumatic experience during sleep, and stimulate the brain to associate that memory with positive feelings. But it’s impossible to say how the human brain would respond to that in practice. ""What you want is for the negative part to be replaced by the positive part,"" Benchenane says. ""But you don’t want the two to be additive, because otherwise you will want something that will scare you, or the positive may become a negative. So we need a little more knowledge about how the positive and negative parts balance in the brain.""",0.6038262263786823,0.39617377362131767,0.5042618904669012,898,5.1670378619153672,437,6.3867276887871851,0,0,"Science, Report"

I was able to go back and change my age When you open up ""Asthma"" — one of the five ResearchKit apps released yesterday — you're asked a number of questions, including about your age. If you say you're not over 18, you're ineligible. But answering ""yes"" to the age question, and going through a few other questions (Are you pregnant? No. Do you live in the US? Yes.) lets you know that you're eligible for the study. Of course, on the internet no one knows you're a dog — or a minor. It's easy to lie about your age online, and Mount Sinai Hospital, the research group behind the app, appears to have dropped the ball in preventing it. In person, it's easy to demand an ID, like a driver's license, to verify age. When I told the app that I was under 18, I was kicked out of the study. But I could still go back to the previous page, and change my answer — and when I did, I was suddenly eligible.

""With Parkinson's disease, or post-chemo cognition, people tap in the wrong place, and so we don't want that to disqualify anyone."" Sure — but perhaps if a user were to change her answer about her age, it might be wise to automatically require an ID photo for age verification. ""We are less worried about fraud and trolling and impersonation."" Wilbanks doesn't think that impersonation will be a significant problem. ""We are less worried about fraud and trolling and impersonation because there's a fair amount of work involved in being in this study, and doing it just for fraudulent purposes is kind of a strange behavior,"" he says. ""People might do it for shits and giggles for a week or two, but I can't see someone doing voice testing and gait testing for 52 weeks when there's no sort of public pay off."" The disease-specific issues raised by Wilbanks make sense, and it is possible that people who wish to impersonate others will get bored with the charade. But there are children with asthma, and it's easy to imagine minors would enroll in these studies without getting consent from their parents — an issue that could open these studies up to an ethical challenge, says Steven Joffe, a medial ethicist at the University of Pennsylvania. ""There are special research protections for minors, including a requirement for parental permission in most cases."" Privacy is also an issue. Apple has clearly thought about this, as evidenced by the words ""Apple will not see your data"" splashed on the gigantic screen behind Jeff Williams, Apple's Vice President of Operations, yesterday. But making sure Apple doesn't get its hands on the data is just part of the issue. ""Apple will not see your data""  ""Everything depends on the quality of the anonymization,"" says Nir Eyal, a medical ethicist at Harvard University. ""If the data can be re-identified, then subjects are exposed to some invasions of privacy."" To ensure that the data they receive is anonymous, Stanford and Oxford University are working with Sage Bionetworks. Sage is the entity that receives the data gathered from users' iPhones. When someone signs up for a study, Sage checks to see if any identifiable information is contained in the data that their phone sends out. If there's anything that could tie a user back to where they live or who they are, it's removed from that person's data stream, Wilbanks says. Sage also makes sure that it doesn't happen again. Once the data is anonymized, it's sent to Stanford so researchers can perform an analysis. Unfortunately, ""we can't promise perfect anonymity,"" Wilbanks says. ""The biggest risk in these studies is to your privacy; we're going to de-identify it, but because we're going to make it available for lots of research, there exists a chance that someone could re-identify you."" ""there exist a chance that someone could re-identify you."" In the medical research world, data isn't shared with other clinics or universities unless the participants give their consent at the beginning of the study, says Michael McConnell, cardiologist at Stanford University and the principal investigator behind the Researchkit-made ""MyHeart Counts"" app. From what we can tell, the apps that have been released so far appear to make that clear. Of course it's possible that a research group might one day decide to sell the information — for instance, to a pharmaceutical company. ""There seems to be nothing preventing researchers from bringing in commercial companies or selling data, with user approval, to commercial bodies,"" Eyal says. ""That's not a problem in its own right, but especially given that the system is based on millions of altruistic volunteers, it would only be appropriate if funding bodies and [review boards] made sure that studies that use this system address major sources of human disease burden — and that products that come out of it will be accessible widely around the world."" Nothing stopping Pfizer from using ResearchKit, too Of course, ResearchKit is open-source, so pharmaceutical companies might actually prefer to get in on the action directly. So far, there doesn't appear to be anything stopping Merck or Pfizer from building an app using ResearchKit and submitting it to the App Store (The Verge contacted Apple to inquire about this yesterday and today, but we have yet to hear back). In that case, these apps would essentially provide a portal for pharmaceutical companies wishing to gather personal health information from iPhone users — and profit from it.   Study eligibility is just a tiny part of the enrollment process. After that, iPhone users must then encounter another thorny ethical area: informed consent. Informed consent is crucial for any medical study; it's the step that lets a participant know what they're in for and what risks are involved in taking part. Normally, researchers go through informed consent with participants in person, one-on-one. ""That interaction is pretty crappy,"" says Sage Bionetworks' Wilbanks. With the apps, the process works a little differently. Participants are shown images, and sometimes videos that help them understand how the study will run. Then, they're given a quiz to test their knowledge. In ""Share the Journey"" and ""mPower,"" users have to get all the questions right, Wilbanks says, to move on the part where they can voluntarily agree to taking part in the study. Those who fail have to go through the consent training all over again. If you get a question wrong, you go through the informed consent training again Being able to take someone through informed consent on a mobile device makes designing large studies easier, says Corey Bridges, CEO of LifeMap Solutions, a mobile health company that partnered with Mount Sinai Hospital to build the Asthma app. ""What we get with ResearchKit is the unshackling of science from those bricks and mortar constraints, so we can do something much more scalable."" Despite some of the improvements to the informed consent process, one problem remains: many of these apps haven't figured out a way to let users ask questions during the process, which is what the one-on-one interaction allows. ""We haven't yet cracked how to ask questions yet,"" Wilbanks says. ""That something that we are going to try to figure out next, for instance, can we come with some sort of peer-to-peer system where people can ask questions."" ""We haven't yet cracked how to ask questions yet."" There's also the possibility that someone might forget that they're taking part in the study because the app is simply gathering data from HealthKit, the iPhone health app that runs in the background. ""It would be too easy for users to turn the function on and then forget about it,"" Joffe says. To fix this, researchers might consider having people renew informed consent on a yearly basis. As a bonus, Joffe says, ""periodic re-consent would encourage partners to provide users with updated information."" If ResearchKit becomes the standard for digital medicine, we're going to run into some problems The researchers involved in these apps are all trying to do something good — and they're doing it by the book, as much as possible in this new territory. These aren't the first apps used in studies, of course. All four of the apps mentioned in this article have an informed consent procedure, and all four have gained institution review board (IRB) approval prior to their release. IRBs are committees that are charged with approving, monitoring, and reviewing research that involves humans; they determine if a study is ethical and safe. They are, in other words, a kind of patient protection. Studies involving mobile apps aren't new, but they're still experimental I find myself wondering if IRB approval is a requirement for all ResearchKit apps that Apple will feature. That's not all I'm wondering about, either. Will medical researchers who use ResearchKit be required to anonymize the data they gather from our phones? Finally, will Apple work with research teams to make sure that study participants are truly are over 18? As of publication, Apple hasn't responded to our requests for comment on these issues. Studies involving mobile apps aren't new, but they're still very experimental. And with Apple's ResearchKit, running medical studies through mobile apps is likely to go mainstream. Last night, Wilbanks tweeted that the Parkinson's disease app mPower had recruited over 7,000 study participants in just a few hours — a number that handily surpasses the previous largest Parkinson's study, which Willbanks says had just 1,700 participants. ""We were pretty shocked as those numbers went up yesterday — in a good way,"" he told The Verge. That means this study could represent a gigantic leap forward for people suffering from Parkinson's disease.  After six hours we have 7406 people enrolled in our Parkinson's study. Largest one ever before was 1700 people. #ResearchKit  ""ironic if the only purpose for which information cannot be collected is medical research."" Advertising agencies and corporations get to profit off our data all the time, so in a way, it makes sense to finally let medical researchers have a seat at the data-driven table. ""It would be ironic if the only purpose for which information cannot be collected is medical research for the betterment of the community,"" Harvard's Eyal says. But if we're going to do this, we need to do it right. ResearchKit won't be available for developers until next month, so it's possible that Apple will make changes before then, or that it will release information about the strict rules it plans to enforce. Right now, though, we're in some pretty murky ethical waters — and displaying the words ""Apple won't see your data"" is a half-inflated life preserver, at best.",0.5197039058992903,0.4802960941007097,0.1789174537616652,2107,4.9966777408637872,858,6.4114219114219111,0,4,"Apple, Apple's Spring Forward Event, Science, Tech, Report"

For many of us, it was our first driving experience that wasn't powered by furious pedaling. But they were still very much toys — quick to lose a full charge and often made of flimsy plastic that was easily damaged.   For parents who would rather spend lavishly on their children's toys, South Korean company Henes is trying to revolutionize cars for kids. They've taken the idea to an entirely new level with the Broon F870 — a fully electric vehicle with dual motors and all-wheel drive (sound familiar?) that boasts a top speed of 10 mph.   That's just the start of it. The F870, which is a souped-up iteration of previous Broon cars (the F810 and F830), is practically a scaled down version of a real luxury sports car. It has all of the accoutrements typically found in the real thing, and then some: a leather bucket seat, a four-point safety harness, working head and tail lamps, a speaker system, foldable side mirrors, differential steering, shock absorbers, a coil-spring suspension, a self-diagnosis program, and a 7-inch Android tablet (with HDMI out). That tablet (which can be swapped for a built-in touch panel) controls an onboard MP3 player as well as allows for parental controls, like setting a maximum speed. All told, the Broon F870 will set you back anywhere between $895 and $1,000 — not too steep a price considering the mostly plastic Power Wheels toys can cost hundreds of dollars themselves. The dimensions of it are so tight that even the 4-foot-tall son of one of Wired's writers had to squeeze to fit, so grown-ups looking to relive some of that Power Wheels glory are going to have to look elsewhere. But just because you can't fit in it doesn't mean you can't have a little bit of fun when your child isn't behind the wheel. The F870 comes with a sleek Bluetooth controller reminiscent of those found with RC cars. And for safety's sake, the car is rigged to stop if the connection is lost, or if you drive it out of range. Unfortunately for now, it's unclear how you would go about ordering one — Broon's shop seems to only offer prints of the concept art of different models. Until then your best option is exploring the strange world of Power Wheels mods.

It's prime real estate to showcase a hot product from the company that shells out top dollar to turn the Renaissance into a billboard for the week. But one way or another, it's always been a tech product. This year, I was surprised to see a giant ad for the BMW i3 and i8 instead. It's tempting to suggest that this is a new trend, but it's not It's tempting to suggest that CES has suddenly transformed into a car show, or that this is a new trend. It's not. Make no mistake, CES is a car show — dozens of car companies and automotive suppliers will be making news here in the Nevada desert over the course of the next seven days — but that's been happening for years. Last year, Ford showed its 2015 Mustang in public for the very first time at CES. Former General Motors CEO Rick Wagoner keynoted the show some seven years ago. In fact, he used that keynote to introduce a concept car — the Cadillac Provoq, a hydrogen-powered SUV that foreshadowed the current generation Cadillac SRX (albeit without the hydrogen part).   Las Vegas' Renaissance Hotel, covered top to bottom in BMW advertising. What is new, perhaps, is the permanence and totality with which the auto industry has declared CES its own. It's no longer a ""trend,"" in the parlance of a journalist or analyst — it's simply part of the show's DNA, the same way televisions and home theater systems are. The lot in front of the Convention Center, where The Verge's temporary headquarters is located, is peppered with car companies: Visteon and Volkswagen are just next door, while BMW has staked out an enormous complex further south. (It's essentially the same complex BMW had last year, but with a new annex devoted to its high-performance M division.) The centerpiece of NVIDIA's parking lot exhibit will be the Renovo Coupe, not Android devices or GPUs. CES isn't an occasional destination for the odd car company looking to make granular, tech-focused news — it's officially part of the annual show circuit, same as Detroit, New York, Geneva, or Frankfurt. BMW's 12-story billboard, lording over the Convention Center grounds, may make that point more clearly than anything we'll see on stage this week.

That's the assertion Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang made in announcing Drive CX, ""the most advanced digital cockpit computer in the world,"" and Drive PX, an auto-pilot supercomputer. Drive CX, the display one, is powered by Nvidia's Maxwell architecture and supports ""every major OS in the world"" — which for the world of cars includes QNX, Linux, and Android. Basically, it's a small computer inside your car capable of processing 16.6 megapixels across multiple screens. In Huang's automotive vision, everything can be a display. Smart mirrors? Check. Displays in the car's pillars? Check. Head rests? Of course — put a screen on it!   What does that mean in reality, though? So far we've seen it add different skins to your speedometer (think: Winamp). Huang is also showing a vertical screen being split into two to show dynamic menus and navigation maps, but mostly it's crazy neon and faux-metallic speedometer skins so far. At one point, Nvidia starts picking up physical slabs of material and showing off new skins. As Huang says, ""These cannot be recreated simply by pictures. They have to be simulated, they have to be computed."" And he's right — Nvidia is trying to show off how powerful its automotive computer is. A superpowered speedometer graphics is certainly one way to do.   The other part of Nvidia's car story is detection — sensors being gradually replaced by cameras. That's where Drive PX comes into play — a ""supercomputer"" with two Tegra X1s that can process 12 cameras in real time. Huang is heavily emphasizing ""GPU-accelerated learning"" here — which is to say, processor-intensive image recognition. ""The beautiful thing about the neural network is that, once you train it, if you ask it 'what's a car?' it'll already know the answer for 'what's an Audi?'"" Remember: Nvidia's announcement isn't for you or me. It's ultimately for the car makers. Nvidia needs to pitch a powerful car processor to the Audis, Mercedes, and Toyotas of the world. Which, yes, includes really crazy looking, faux-neon-and-bamboo gauges and ""computer vision"" that can detect different breeds of dogs.

AtYourService — an OnStar feature — will enable ""information, convenience and money-saving values"" to be automatically delivered to your car. It'll use the destinations you enter as cues for which promotions to deliver, so for instance, if you're going to Dunkin' Donuts, an OnStar advisor can send a great donut deal straight to your dashboard.

The New York City foundry owns and sells licenses for well-known font families like Whitney and Gotham, and has also designed typefaces for The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, Wired, Esquire, HP, Nike, and others.  Frere-Jones sold fonts 'worth $3 million' for $10 The lawsuit was filed by Frere-Jones, who claims that Hoefler essentially tricked him into believing he would become an equal partner in H&FJ, previously known as the Hoefler Type Foundry (HTF). Frere-Jones joined HTF in 1999, and claims he was promised equal equity and his ""name above the door"" in exchange for transferring the rights for some of the typefaces he designed, including Whitney, to the company. In 2004, Frere-Jones sold the typefaces to HTF for just $10. At the time, Frere-Jones claims, their royalty value stood at $3 million, and the designer says he never would have transferred the rights if not for the agreement that he would become a 50-50 partner. According to the lawsuit, first reported by Quartz, the partnership was only agreed verbally, but Frere-Jones cites a public relations release commissioned by Hoefler's wife which reads: ""Jonathan Hoefler, Principal of The Hoefler Type Foundry, and Tobias Frere- Jones, Type Director of The Hoefler Type Foundry, announced today that they have entered into an agreement to become equal partners and to rename the business Hoefler & Frere-Jones Typography."" ""I'm working on it. Stop harassing me."" Frere-Jones claims Hoefler ""repeatedly acknowledged his obligation"" to transfer a 50 percent stake in the company, but never did so. The pair's relationship began to sour last year, when Frere-Jones alleges Hoefler scheduled a deal completion date of July 31st 2013. On that date, Frere-Jones says he followed up with Hoefler, who allegedly responded ""Stop it. I'm working on it. Stop harassing me."" It is unclear from the filing if this response was written or verbal. Almost three months later, it's alleged that Hoefler ""explicitly reneged on his personal agreement"" to transfer 50 percent of the company for the first time. Frere-Jones says he has been told and believes that the shares in question have now been transferred to Hoefler's wife, Carleen Borsella. Frere-Jones is seeking at least $20 million in compensation. ""These allegations ... are false and without legal merit."" Update: The type foundry at the center of the allegations has released a statement regarding the lawsuit. The statement refers to Tobias Frere-Jones as ""a long-time employee"" and says his allegations ""are not the facts and they profoundly misrepresent Tobias's relationship with both the company and Jonathan [Hoefler]."" It goes on to say that the company will ""vigorously defend itself against these allegations, which are false and without legal merit."" The statement adds that the world-famous Hoefler & Frere-Jones brand is simply a name that the Hoefler Type Foundry has been doing business as. Moving forward, the company will now do business as ""Hoefler & Co."", and the newly named type foundry is keen to note it ""will continue to be a great place for design ... continuing to create the kinds of typefaces that designers have come to expect from us for more than 25 years.""",0.6278298720531027,0.3721701279468973,0.8887676767618711,568,5.169014084507042,308,5.9448051948051948,0,0,"Culture, Design, Typography"
