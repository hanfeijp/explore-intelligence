Ubisoft has brought Rainbow Six Siege and the all-new For Honor for gamers to try out in Cologne, while DICE used the show to debut a massive 20-player dogfight mode in Star Wars: Battlefront. Blizzard's Heroes of the Storm has been everywhere too, but it's another title from the same company that I want to talk about today: Overwatch. It, along with Gearbox Software's Battleborn, is establishing a new category of team-based shooter games, one where violence and gore are de-emphasized in favor of accessibility and cooperative fun. A MOBA for FPS fans, an FPS for MOBA fans Anyone who's ever played Team Fortress 2 will find both of these new games familiar, and they do indeed owe a measure of creative debt to Valve's enduringly popular team shooter. But you can't have a class of games made up of just one, and it's only now that TF2 is finding more games willing to explore its quirky mix of cartoony visuals, frenetic action, and exaggerated weaponry. The typical definition of a first-person shooter (FPS) game immediately brings to mind the Call of Duty series, where realism is prized and storylines revolve around plausible near-future scenarios. You are a soldier with a rifle, and though the specifics of what you and the rifle can do might change, the essence of gritty warfare is generally right at the heart of the game. Big publishers like Blizzard and 2K Games, which is responsible for Battleborn's release, are now investing their time and effort into creating games that take a different approach.  Because FPS games thrust the player directly into the body of the controlled character, they immediately feel more intimate. That's what makes them so exciting and captivating, but it's also what puts off many players who don't fancy spending their afternoon enjoying a first-person view of some bleak dystopia filled with dying screams and smoking shotgun shells. Sometimes, people just want a lighthearted blast-'em-up that doesn't make them feel like homicidal maniacs, and that's where Battleborn and Overwatch come in. They both blend the familiarity and immediacy of first-person shooters with the superheroic aspects of third-person team-based games like Heroes of the Storm. HotS is the newest prominent name in the class of multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) games that is headed up by League of Legends and Dota 2. It's because of the wild popularity and runaway commercial success of those games that we're now getting titles like Battleborn, Overwatch, and the Xbox One-bound Gigantic. Not every shooting game has to make the player feel like a homicidal maniac Both Battleborn and Overwatch offer highly stylized playable characters with diverse abilities and roles. MOBA veterans will find themselves at home with Battleborn's hero leveling system, which lets you progressively upgrade and augment your hero as you make your way through a mission or a fight. It's probably improper to label these new games as FPS titles, given how much else each player can do beyond merely shooting. They are certainly a hybrid.  These games are fantastic, in both their setting and gameplay While they share a number of qualities, Battleborn and Overwatch have their differences as well. The latter game retains a greater sense of realism; it still feels like a stylized reality as opposed to a complete other world. Battleborn, on the other hand, is just gleeful in casting off the chains of our world and exploring visual and mechanical caricatures. An Overwatch hero, even one with teleportation abilities, feels much more human than a Battleborn character. Real-world physics are more closely adhered to in Overwatch, which may appeal to fans of traditional FPS that don't want to completely abandon their heritage. Personally, I have fallen in love with the design and gameplay of Battleborn: it's instantly accessible and fun, and its heroes' superhuman litheness means there's rarely a pause in the action. Basically, I feel like Battleborn is the better game, and its fantastic elements serve to augment rather than undermine the pacing and joy of the gameplay. My impressions of the two games at Gamescom have left me excited for the future of shooter games. I've heeded many Calls of Duty in my time, and was once deeply addicted to Rainbow Six 3: Raven Shield, but have felt the need for something truly different to diversify the genre. I like what I'm seeing from Blizzard and Gearbox this year, even without knowing the full rosters of characters and abilities that their new games will offer. The potential is clearly there and, in the case of Battleborn, the quality and fun of the gameplay are beyond question. Maybe I'll reach a similarly glowing conclusion about Overwatch once I've had more time to accustom myself to its heroes and learn the nuance of what they can do. I'm looking forward to finding out.",0.7552696899957425,0.2447303100042575,0.16210972382461422,825,5.0290909090909093,467,6.1113490364025695,0,0,"Culture, Entertainment, Gaming, Gamescom , Hands-on"

Deadline reports that the series, which limped off the air in 2009 after two incredible seasons and two mediocre ones, will return for 10 episodes. The first one is now being written by creator Paul Scheuring, with stars Wentworth Miller and Dominic Purcell returning as brothers who perpetually find themselves caught up in shadowy conspiracies. They will probably have to break out of something again. It could be fun! Prison Break's return to the air is made possible by its popularity on streaming video services, particularly Netflix, where it has been one of the most-binged shows, according to the NPD Group. Fox executives have said Netflix reintroduced the show to a younger audience, resulting in several adoring Tumblrs devoted to retelling its story, largely through GIFs. It's the latest Fox show to get rebooted, following 24 and the upcoming renewal of The X-Files. A notable combination of absurd premise and tight plotting When it debuted in 2005, Prison Break was notable for its combination of absurd premise and tight plotting. When Lincoln Burrows (Purcell) is wrongfully convicted of murdering the brother of the vice president, his brother Michael commits an armed robbery so that he can be imprisoned alongside him and break him out. To aid in his plan, he tattoos the escape plan on his body, disguising it as art. It got pretty outlandish from there! But each episode moved the brothers closer to their escape, and the show expertly ratcheted up the suspense as the big day drew closer. The second season, which forced the brothers to reckon with the death and destruction resulting from the escape, added a surprising moral dimension to what had previously been hot pulpy trash. That said, the show was narratively exhausted by the end of its run, and most of its beloved characters had died onscreen. Bringing everyone magically back to life and contriving to put them behind bars once again will be absurd — though perhaps not any more absurd than the original.",0.665703661087584,0.33429633891241595,0.8110662877855673,365,4.9671232876712326,242,5.8140495867768598,0,0,"Culture, Entertainment"

The devices began as little more than two-way audio and video feeds, but more recent models come with sophisticated web services, including app access and remote viewing. But as manufacturers add new features, a new report shows that their security may not be keeping pace. The report, by Mark Stanislav and Tod Beardsley of security analytics provider Rapid7, focuses on the security of retail video baby monitors. Stanislav and Beardsley analysed nine cameras from eight different vendors, including Philips, Summer and iBaby, and assigned them A-F letter grades after assessing the security of their mobile applications, device firmware and web services. Each device was then rated on a 250-point scale for overall security. ""Do they encrypt web service API calls? When the camera authenticates the service, is that encrypted? Deduct points if not,"" said Stanislav, explaining the scoring system. Eight of the nine cameras received a failing grade The results were abysmal. Eight of the nine cameras received a failing F, while the other received a D. The security failures included a number of known vulnerabilities, including transmitting video and sending data to servers without encryption. Many of the connected devices also had built-in passwords that could be guessed (or worse, published) by the attacker, a long-standing concern in embedded devices. Rapid7 researchers also discovered a number of new vulnerabilities, including one that could let attackers access the video feed to the Summer Baby Zoom WiFi Monitor. The camera includes a web access feature, which lets remote users (relatives in another state, for instance) watch the video feed remotely, as long as they've been authenticated through a URL sent via email. But triggering that email is easier than it should be. According to Stanislav, the web service doesn't provide any sort of secure token, so an attacker could easily fake a remote access request if they wanted to watch the video remotely. From there, a separate privilege escalation bug could be exploited to give them administrator access over the device. A similar bug popped up in two Philips In.Sight models. The monitor lets users tap into the camera's stream through the Philips app, but in order to show that stream, the camera hosts it on a public address. If someone scanned the limited number of addresses where those feeds are hosted, they could easily see which cameras are actively being watchedand tap directly into those video feeds. There aren't any any restrictions on who can access the stream, and once an attacker has broken in, they can keep the feed open even after the user has closed the app. Fortunately for In.Sight customers, Philips is expected to patch the bug later this week. ""Whilst the security vulnerabilities are a concern and are being addressed, at this time we are not aware of any consumers who have been directly affected by this issue,"" the company said in a statement. No other vendors reported a forthcoming patch, although Rapid7 disclosed the bugs in early July. Many processors don't have the ability to support live video encryption data Many of the vulnerabilities have to do with service architecture rather than the devices themselves, so in theory, they should be simple to patch. Unfortunately, most monitor companies are still getting used to the demanding world of vulnerability disclosure. As the report puts it, ""the absence of a fast, reliable, and safe patch pipeline is a serious and ongoing deployment failure for the IoT [internet of things]."" Unencrypted video streams are particularly tricky since processors in many cameras simply don't have the ability to support live video encryption data, making the devices insecure by design. Many of the attack vectors described in the report will be difficult to stop entirely. As baby monitors have gotten more web-friendly, they've also grown more dependent on manufacturers' remote servers, often run by a third party. If any link in the chain is breached, every camera using the service will be vulnerable. It's a powerful line of attack, and hard to block off without keeping the devices off the web entirely. ""Your camera could be behind eight firewalls,"" says Stanislav, ""but as long as it's connecting to the internet, it's at risk.""",0.4345596073134329,0.5654403926865671,0.6404826303592469,704,5.1605113636363633,385,6.2077922077922079,0,0,"Tech, Report"

This year’s crop is no different, although the company is not only unveiling a new flagship and a new ""pocket friendly"" device (the 5.2-inch Xperia Z5 and 4.6-inch Xperia Z5 Compact respectively) but also a so-called ""super flagship"" — the imposing 5.5-inch Xperia Z5 Premium, which the company claims is the world’s first 4K smartphone. Like previous years, the new Xperias feature the same, tried-and-tested design: glass on the front and back, and a rounded, bumper-like frame protecting the edges. There are small variations between the three, like a new frosted effect on the glass of the Z5’s back, but these are essentially the same Xperias you’ve seen before. Luckily for Sony the look still feels surprisingly fresh — an unintended benefit, perhaps, of the company's low smartphone sales.   In terms of essential specs, the three Z5s are pretty similar. (The main differences are size, materials, and screen resolution.) There’s the same Snapdragon 810 64-bit processor powering each of them, with both the Z5 and Z5 Premium sporting 3GB of RAM while the smaller Compact gets 2GB.  All three devices are dust-tight and waterproof with capless micro USB ports, offer up to 32GB of internal memory (expandable up to 200GB with microSD cards), and have enough battery to last for up two days' use, says Sony. The biggest addition besides a new 23-megapixel camera (more on which later) is a fingerprint sensor built into the phones’ power button. As with previous Xperias, this button is located on the right-hand side of the device, falling under right-handed users’ thumbs. But instead of a little metal nub, it’s now a slim oval flush with the side of the smartphone. Sony’s argument is that a side-mounted sensor is more convenient than Apple or Samsung’s front-facing solutions, and while the time saved is extremely small (how long does it take to move your thumb an inch or two?), Sony says it's worth it considering how frequently we unlock our phones. In our brief test the sensor was as responsive as you’d like and the placement was certainly handy, but it’s not a dramatic improvement over Sony's rivals. Perhaps more importantly for the Z5s is Sony’s new camera, found in all three of the smartphones. The company is supremely confident about this 23-megapixel snapper, which incorporates the first new image sensor and camera module in the Xperia range since the Z1. It also boasts a hybrid autofocus that the company claims is the fastest in any smartphone (just 0.03 seconds) and a 5X zoom. Sony is promising that the camera will address all the traditional ""pain points"" of taking pictures on a smartphone (i.e. handling low light, quick focusing), and while it’s true that Xperia devices have an above-average photo quality for Android phones, we’ll have to wait for a full review to really judge its prowess.   The problem is, with rivals like Motorola offering comparably adept devices without the flashy design and accompanying price tag, can Sony convince customers it’s worth paying extra? We’ll be able to judge a little better once the company announces pricing, with the Z5 and Z5 Compact expected to be available globally from this October, and the Z5 Premium landing a little later in November.",0.7076278465461798,0.29237215345382017,0.19795651459114383,573,5.0436300174520072,342,6.1578947368421053,0,58,"Google, Mobile, Tech, IFA 2015"

Acer, Asus, and Lenovo are on a charm offensive at IFA this year, and their target demographic is that reliably spendthrift group we know as gamers. Collectively, these three companies account for a third of global PC shipments, and they represent an industry-wide trend toward promoting more gaming gear. The hope is that slumping PC sales can be rejuvenated by appealing to the class of users who upgrade their hardware most often and spend most lavishly. The PC gaming market produced $21.5... There are many things ailing Sony's once-great empire. Its PC business is now its former PC business, and the mobile devices that were meant to save it have landed the company into even more trouble. In spite of making a series of very good Xperia smartphones, the Japanese company finds itself perpetually on the back foot against competitors that are either cheaper, more popular, better distributed, or some combination of all three. So how do you solve a problem like Sony's smartphone... Oh, Kodak, you used to be an institution. When people needed new film for their cameras, yours was the first name they thought of. You encapsulated the joy of photography with one of the most elegant marketing slogans ever: the Kodak moment. But now you're trapped in a hexagonal prison of emotions. Regretting all the things you didn't do. Mourning the opportunities you didn't take and the adaptations you didn't make. Your reputation has reached its inevitable nadir. You are now a selfie... A year ago, I was here at IFA in a state of exasperation. Every electronics company was throwing a diversity of awkward smartwatches at the wall and waiting to see what stuck. Nothing did, because they were all too big, unwieldy, and compromised. This year, though, Samsung has launched a volley so powerful and immediately convincing that it might just break the wall down entirely. I’ve just worn the first smartwatch that I would actually consider buying. Trying on Parrot’s new Zik 3 headphones is like being swaddled in expensive upholstery. The wireless headphones’ plush exterior feels soft in your hand and fits snugly over your ears. Then Parrot’s new automatic noise canceling software kicks in and the outside world is muted before you start listening to whatever music you prefer. But in the same way that a treacherously squashy sofa can trap the unwary, the Zik 3 can be difficult to get full control over. Can too much comfort be a bad... Alcatel wants its new 17.3-inch Xess tablet to be a multipurpose hub for the family, providing recipes in the kitchen, films in the living room, and a digital whiteboard for to-do lists and upcoming events. However, the severely underpowered Android device doesn't seem to be capable of entertaining even a single individual, let alone a whole household. The device has a fine 1920 x 1080 display, but an unspecified 1.5 GHz processor and 2GB of RAM mean that even swiping through pages of apps... Huawei's design ideas might not be wholly original, but that doesn't mean the company's not building great smartphones. Its new flagship, the Mate S, is the case in point. Some models have a pressure-sensitive screen that just happens to have the same name as Apple's Force Touch technology and the rear and sides of the device might look like a HTC One M9, but this is still a device that's clean-looking, well built, and just a pleasure to hold in the hand.  Its rear-mounted fingerprint... Philips made a splash at last year's IFA conference when it showed off a television set with embedded, handheld projectors that could take an image onscreen and extend it to the wall behind the set. The visual trick is intended to create a more immersive viewing experience as the picture pours off the screen. Now a variation of Philips' Ambilight technology, which it calls ""Ambilight projection,"" is making its way to a new 65-inch AmbiLux 4K TV due out later this year.  The Dutch lighting... Earlier this year, Marshall surprised the tech community by unveiling the London smartphone — a conventional Android device with quite unconventional styling. At the time, Marshall was lauded for doing something different in the rather staid smartphone world (or rather, the Swedish firm Zound Industries was praised for not messing up the brand they'd licensed), but how does the London stand up to closer scrutiny? Samsung and smartwatches have had a tenuous relationship. It's not for lack of trying — Samsung released six different smartwatches before Apple even launched one — it's just that none of them have been particularly good. Chunky designs, slow performance, and limited software have all been things that have plagued Samsung's smartwatch efforts since they began in 2013. That all may be changing, however, as the recently announced Gear S2 is the most promising smartwatch I've seen from Samsung. Samsung's meteoric rise as a smartphone maker began with the Galaxy S, a 2010 Android handset with some high specs and more than a passing resemblance to the iPhone. That formula of pushing the limits of specs and the boundaries of Apple's intellectual property is now being reprised by Huawei. But the Chinese giant, better known for its telecom equipment, isn't limiting itself to Apple — it's taking inspiration and borrowing ideas from every device maker around, while still finding ways to... Gaming is a big theme of IFA 2015. Acer's unleashing a whole new line of Predators, and Lenovo is taking on the challenge with a new range of gaming PCs of its own. But as aggressive and hungry for hype as both have been, neither is going quite as far as Asus, which today introduced the world's first water-cooled laptop. So far at IFA 2015 we've seen a water-cooled laptop, an arachnid router, and an orange-weighing smartphone. In among all this extravagance, however, there's one company that's still retaining a bit of sobriety and approaching IFA in a professional manner. Yes, I speak of Sony. The Japanese company's presentation left me feeling a bit flat, probably because its phones all leaked well in advance of the show, but getting them in my hands has revitalized my spirits and rekindled my anticipation.... Sony has unveiled its new lineup of Xperia smartphones, and this year's headline model is the Xperia Z5 Premium. Available in chrome, black, and gold, the Z5 Premium looks undeniably luxurious, and the company claims its 5.5-inch 4K display is a first for a smartphone. However, with internal specs that are identical to the smaller, more reserved Xperia Z5 (and not far off the ""pocket friendly"" Z5 Compact), it's not clear if the Premium has more to show beyond a rich, glossy finish.  Huawei today announced the Mate S, a new flagship phone that includes a familiar sounding feature: Force Touch. That's also the name of Apple's pressure-based touchscreen technology, which is featured on the Apple Watch and will reportedly be included on the new iPhone. The Android-based smartphone was unveiled today at IFA in Berlin. It features a 5.5-inch AMOLED display, with a full metal shell and curved back, but most notable are its user interaction components. The Mate S includes an... If you were wondering how Asus would respond to the challenge of Google's OnHub wireless router, wonder no longer. Forged in an off-world colony and teleported here by its own sheer power of will, the artfully titled RT-AC5300 is a wireless portal like no other. It takes the spaceship looks of D-Link's Ultra router and ratchets them up to 11. Behold the behemoth! Asus' all-new flagship gaming laptop is less of a notebook and more of an oddly-rearranged desktop PC. The 17-inch Asus GX700, making its debut here at IFA in Berlin, is among the first laptops to feature Intel's overclocking-ready K series Skylake CPUs, and it comes with a full water cooling system to help keep it chilly. Nvidia GeForce GTX graphics and a 4K resolution are the only other details that Asus is disclosing right now. The Taiwanese company is just teasing... Toshiba announced its new Satellite Radius 12 at IFA this morning. It combines a 12.5-inch 4K display with a camera that supports Windows Hello facial recognition, and USB Type-C. I got a chance to get a closer look at the Satellite Radius 12, and while it’s not the best Windows laptop I’ve ever used it’s certainly exciting. It feels like a good example of the types of convertibles we’re going to start seeing soon, with 4K displays, USB Type-C, and support for logging into Windows 10 with... There are many superlatives you'll hear this week about Intel's new sixth-generation Core (codename Skylake) processors. They are fast and efficient, they can do a whole heap of other things beyond pure computation, and they're enabling a new generation of thinner and longer-lasting mobile PCs. The one thing you probably won't hear is how these new chips look — which is fair enough since you're supposed to use them, not look at them. Still, there's an undeniable techno beauty to these chips,... Lenovo calls its new Ideapad Miix 700 ""recognizably different"" with a ""progressive design,"" but it's hard to see it as anything but a Microsoft Surface clone. Designed with Windows 10 in mind, the Miix 700 is a 12-inch tablet with an adjustable kickstand at the rear. That all sounds similar to Microsoft's Surface Pro 3, and if you look at the Miix 700 then you'll see the similarities aren't minor. Intel makes a habit of announcing its new processor generations in gradual steps. A month ago, it introduced the first members of its sixth-gen Core family — better known by the codename Skylake — in the form of the overclocking-ready Core i7-6700K and Core i5-6600K, a pair of desktop chips primarily aimed at gamers.

The oil company is allowed to start exploratory drilling in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas later this summer. The plan submitted by Shell has been in the works since 2011; it has been revising the plan with the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management since then. The most recent version proposes the drilling of up to six wells within the Burger Prospect, an oil-rich area in roughly 140 feet of water 70 miles northwest of the village of Wainwright. One ship has given Shell trouble in the past Shell will use a semi-submersible drilling unit called the Transocean Polar Pioneer and a drillship called the Noble Discoverer — the same one that caught fire in 2012. That incident took place in the same area in the Arctic that Shell was just approved for and, along with an oil containment system failure, prompted an investigation by Interior Department. Two years later, Noble Drilling pleaded guilty to eight felony charges related to the accidents. Just last week, Vice reported that the same anti-pollution equipment that failed in 2012 suffered another failure, and the Noble Discoverer was subsequently locked in a detention hold in Honolulu until it was fixed. A Shell spokesman told Vice that it was just ""a case of mechanical repairs, which, from time to time, are required on any equipment."" To get today's approval, Shell had to create a contingency plan for a spill or rig malfunction, according to The New York Times. The news comes just a few months after the Interior Department first proposed regulations to allow exploratory drilling. And while seasonal conditions in the Arctic mean that drilling can typically only be done between July and October, it's thought that a reduction of the ice due to climate change could start an Arctic drilling boom. According to the statement, Shell is still required to obtain necessary permits from other state and federal agencies. Those include drill permits and making sure that the drilling complies with the Endangered Species Act. The plan will also certainly face loads of criticism, some of which is already rolling in. David Yarnold, president of the Audubon Society (a group known for its burns), has already released a statement calling the plan a ""phony deal.""

It should also let those who don't partake know that jumping into a car with smokers will probably get them high. The study, published in Drug and Alcohol Dependence, was led by Evan S. Herrmann, Ph.D., a postdoctoral fellow in psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Johns Hopkins. Researchers recruited a relatively small sample of seven smokers and 12 nonsmokers, all between 18 and 45, for the study. Six from each group were placed side by side in a 10-by-13-foot acrylic enclosure for an hour, and the smokers were given 10 joints with high-potency weed to smoke. In one session, the room was ventilated, while in another it wasn't. As you might imagine, the nonsmokers in the unventilated room got pretty high.

And although other states have passed similar laws, Wyoming's seems especially broad: photographs are specifically covered by the law, while the land could mean any place outside of a town or city.

He found holes bored into the foundation of a grain silo and feces littering the trash pit: telltale signs of a rat infestation, probably 100 strong. He scattered aquamarine pellets of poison, then returned with seven pest control officers, including Phil Merrill, head of the province’s rat patrol. Using a crane, they hoisted the granary off its foundation, watching for anything scurrying out, one officer standing ready with a shotgun. All the rats were dead. The patrol stomped on the burrows, then burned the silo for good measure. It was a bit of a disappointment, Merrill said. A few years earlier, they’d gunned down 157 rats at a single farm. Merrill was swigging chocolate milk and recounting stories of past infestations as we drove toward the control zone, a sparsely populated buffer between Alberta, the largest inhabited rat-free region on Earth, and the rest of the infested planet. There was the rat in an Air Canada cockpit (chased down the tarmac, killed) and the infestation at the dump (poisoned, monitored with night-vision cameras to be sure). Keeping the province rat-free requires constant vigilance, and every spring and fall, Merrill and his team patrol the zone. All members of the genus Rattus are banned from the province, but Alberta is especially alert for one species: the brown rat, also known as the wharf rat, sewer rat, and Norway rat. That last one is a bit of a misnomer: the species traces its origins to northern China and reached Europe only in the 18th century, where it scurried aboard ships and made landfall in North America around the time of the American Revolution. Fast, strong, and highly adaptable, it’s now present just about anywhere humans live or visit. Alberta had the good luck of being one of the last places rats invaded, and in 1950, the government decided to keep them out rather than try to control them once they gained a foothold. The first and most important step was to teach Albertans — some of whom had never seen rats before — to fear and hate them. Preserved rat corpses were exhibited at schools and fairs, and the government printed World War II-style posters depicting a province besieged by rodent hordes. The message was clear: if the rats were to be kept out, all citizens had to do their part — fortifying their farms, reporting incursions, and if need be, taking up arms. The campaign has been largely successful, and half a century on, Albertans remain vigilant. Merrill’s rat patrol has a hotline, 310-RATS, where people can report possible sightings. The hotline gets hundreds of calls a year, mostly false alarms — misidentified muskrats or pocket gophers. When Albertans do spot a rat, they often act quickly, beating it to death with bats or shovels before calling it in. They even report their neighbors for keeping pet rats, or fancy rats, as exterminators call them. Rats are rats, and Alberta’s government gives them no quarter. Sometimes the owners have their rats flown out of the province, but generally, Merrill said, ""We take care of them."" Alberta’s landscape makes eradication feasible. It’s sparsely populated, and its sprawling farms and small towns provide few structures where rats can shelter from the harsh winters. The 250,000-square-mile province is protected by the Rocky Mountains in the west, frigid forests to the north, and badlands to the south. Accordingly, the government concentrates its efforts on a 400-mile-long strip on the eastern border with Saskatchewan. As the nine members of the patrol travel through the control zone, they check every building that might harbor a rat. They examine foundations for signs of gnawing, ask farmers if they’ve seen anything suspicious, and hand out buckets of poison pellets. Merrill, an energetic and affable 64-year-old who’s worked pest control since 1971, says that the key to catching a rat is to think like a rat: you want a granary, preferably an old wooden one; you want bales of barley or something with a bit of protein to snack on; and you want water. Each time Merrill clears a site, he marks it on a GPS map with a skull and crossbones. We pulled up to a farmhouse, and Merrill knocked on the door. ""Rat patrol here, come to see if you’re harboring any rats,"" he called out. A gangly, weathered man in his 60s invited Merrill in, pulled out a chair, and the two swapped local rat gossip. They discussed a dilapidated grain house just over the border in Saskatchewan. As a rule, rats stick close to home, rarely traveling more than a few hundred feet from their nest, but when things get too crowded, some venture out, running through the surrounding fields; most die, but a few find a new building and start to breed. Merrill reckoned there were hundreds of rats in the grain house, and the colony was sending rats out in a 5-mile radius. With the cooperation of the other province’s pest control officer, he wanted to poison it, maybe raze it completely. ""We’ve got to fight them over there so we don’t have to fight them over here,"" he told me. The control zone is a buffer for Alberta, but now Merrill wanted a buffer for the buffer. How far can his rat campaign go, I asked him. Forever, he said. ""I know Alberta can do it. Saskatchewan has seen the vision and is two-thirds rat free already. Montana has very few rats; they could be rat free. Vancouver, New York, port cities would be more difficult, but eventually I think we can win there, too. I think the world — we’re winning. We’re going to win."" For thousands of years, people have devised all manner of traps to crush, poison, smother, and electrocute rats. We bred terriers to kill them, then used ferrets to flush them out of their holes. Bounties were offered, and parties were organized to club, shoot, and stab them. People tried feeding them wet plaster, hoping it’d harden and kill them (it didn’t). We tied tiny bells to them, hoping they’d scare other rats away (it didn’t). People sniped them from trees and gassed them in ships. In the 1960s, The New York Daily News declared ""all-out war on rats"" and armed teens with poison: ""1,000 teeners will spearhead assault on rats,"" read the declaration. ""War is on!"" So far, the war has been as futile as it’s been bloody. Rats thrive in the new ecosystems humans have made: they lurk in city infrastructure, eating our waste; they infiltrate farms, eating stores of food; and they hitchhike on global trade, devouring birds, turtles, and anything else they come across. Far from beating them back, we’ve helped rats spread to every continent except Antarctica. The rat’s future looks bright. Trade is accelerating, and cities are expanding as their infrastructure decays. But in a few places, people are bringing new tactics and technology to the war on rats. Scientists, city planners, exterminators, engineers, pilots, and ordinary citizens are all enlisted in these new campaigns, which offer hope of finally pushing back the rat, at least for a while. If there’s a constant in the history of rat control, it’s the sense that there must be a better way. An early 20th century Department of Agriculture report is florid in its despair: ""For centuries the animal has been banned, and human ingenuity has been taxed to the utmost to suppress it,"" wrote David E. Lantz. ""Everywhere the history of the contest is the same. Though thousands are killed, the relief is only temporary, and other thousands soon replace the slain. Therefore, if conducted along the old lines, the war promises to be never-ending."" Chemicals developed in the middle of the 20th century raised hopes that perhaps technology could vanquish the rat. But rats are cautious — neophobic, is the technical term. They’re so wary of new things in their environment that experienced exterminators leave traps unset for days, letting rats become accustomed to eating from them. Modern anticoagulant poison is designed to be slow-acting, bursting the rodent’s capillaries days after ingestion, so that other rats won’t associate the bait with death. The problem is that rats breed too quickly for poison to make much difference. The Norway rat has a three-week gestation period and can produce five litters a year, each with four to eight offspring. In as few as three months, those rats can produce litters of their own. In theory, a single pair is capable of giving rise to thousands of progeny in under a year. So, we kill them as fast as we can. We kill rats because they eat our food and defecate in whatever they don’t eat. They once caused famines, though in modern agriculture they’ve been reduced to a nuisance — the FDA publishes limits of acceptable ""rodent filth"" per gram. We kill rats because they’re reservoirs of disease, including plague, which wiped out 60 percent of Europe’s population in the 14th century and for which we’ve never forgiven them. They swarm with other diseases as well: a recent study of rats caught in New York City found pathogens proven to cause salmonella, E. coli, hantavirus, and Leptospira, as well as 18 previously unknown viruses. We kill rats because they destroy the things we build: they gnaw on wires, starting fires, and gas lines, causing explosions. Their burrows collapse streets and sidewalks. Today, some of the most aggressive rat control projects are carried out by ecologists, trying to kill rats before rats kill native fauna. Every era hates rats in its own way. We hate rats because they thrive in the places we try to forget: sewers, empty lots, derelict buildings, mountainous landfills. ""Rats live in man’s parallel universe, surviving on the effluvia of human society,"" writes Robert Sullivan in his book Rats. When they scurry onto the subway platform or pop out of our toilets — an urban legend that’s all too true — it’s like a furry little return of the repressed. They’re ambassadors of entropy, appearing in huge numbers during floods, wars, economic decline, or other periods of disorder. All of that is captured in a pervasive feeling: rats are gross. In late March, on a glacier-riven sliver of land 1,000 miles off the coast of Antarctica, a team of conservationists completed the largest rat eradication ever attempted. Over the course of four years, and at a cost of $12 million, they used helicopters to bombard South Georgia Island with almost 400 tons of poison bait. It’s the most ambitious attempt yet to turn back the rats, and the mission’s measure for success is unforgiving: if a single rat is left alive, they’ve failed. When project leader Dr. Tony Martin first visited South Georgia 20 years ago, the impact of the rats was stark. Neighboring rat-free islands were brimming with birds and lush with plants fertilized by their droppings. South Georgia itself, however, was barren as a desert. ""I thought at that time if I could ever get rid of the rats I’d die a happy man,"" Martin said, at home in Cambridge after a long journey from the South Atlantic. Before humans set foot on its shores, South Georgia was a refuge for penguins, albatrosses, and other seabirds. But then came the sealers, and they brought the rats, which devoured the birds: eating eggs, chicks, and even fully grown birds, Martin said, grabbing their necks and devouring their brains while still alive. It's estimated that 90 percent of the island's seabirds have been wiped out by rats. South Georgia’s story has played out on islands around the world. A disproportionate amount of the world’s biodiversity lives on islands, where species often evolved in isolation from mammalian predators. But when rats arrived, these ecological niches became smorgasbords. Burrowing, ground-nesting, and flightless birds were eaten quickly. Baby tortoises were gnawed to death. Rats are responsible for about half of all bird and reptile extinctions on islands, according to Gregg Howald of the group Island Conservation. ""I have enormous regard for rats,"" Martin said. ""I get no pleasure out of killing them. But the way I look at it, and I recognize this is a very imperialistic view, is that something is going to die here whether we do something or not, and the choice therefore is not whether to kill or not, it’s whether we kill rats, which were introduced by man, or allow the rats your forebears put in place to eradicate the native population. Because I have the power, the resources, to kill rats, and hereby save species from going extinct, I choose to use that power."" Aerial rat eradication was pioneered in the 1990s in New Zealand, where, as Elizabeth Kolbert wrote last year, defending native birds has become an issue of nationalism. They are, after all, Kiwis. Conservationists loaded poison into modified fertilizer buckets and used them to disperse bait evenly over entire islands. Some birds would succumb to the poison, but it was worth it: researchers found that if they killed every last rat, native bird populations quickly rebounded beyond pre-eradication levels. GPS changed the game, according to Keith Springer, a New Zealand conservation officer who worked on the South Georgia mission. It let them overlay islands with a close-knit grid that helicopter pilots could trace, ensuring that no spot is missed. Other groups copied the strategy. In 2007, Ecuador began clearing the Galapagos Islands of rats, which threatened to wipe out the islands' tortoises. The eradication program was a success: last year, for the first time in over a century, tortoises were born in the wild on Pinzon Island and survived. In the Aleutians, the US Fish and Wildlife Service killed every rat on Rat Island, where a shipwreck had deposited them in the 1780s. Puffins and cormorants quickly returned, and the island was renamed Hawadax. At 100 miles long, South Georgia is the most ambitious island eradication effort attempted yet. The team divided the island into three sections, each separated by a glacier, and used helicopters to fly along the GPS grid they’d drawn, flinging poison nuggets from a bucket 150 feet above the ground. It’s been several years since the first two sections were poisoned, and the team has seen no sign of rat survivors. On March 23rd, after weeks of storm delays, Martin watched a helicopter fly out to strafe the island with the final load of poison bait. ""It’s strange,"" he said. ""I’ve thought about this moment for the last six years — it consumed my life. I imagined we’d be exultant when the last load went out, but we were completely flat. We just stood there thinking, now what?"" He’s hoping for more eradication projects, bigger projects. He’d like his team to travel the world, ""a kind of baiting flying circus,"" he said. When I spoke with him, he was optimistic, having just read a paper in the journal Biological Conservation imagining what the next generation of rodent eradication might look like. The paper outlines an arsenal of possible technologies. There are automatic traps like the Spitfire, which sprays sticky poison onto rats when they pass through a tube, killing them when they lick it off, and the A24, which uses a CO2-fired piston to smash their skulls. Species-specific poisons could be dropped by drones day and night. Maybe the most ambitious method involves the release of transgenic rats, engineered so that their progeny would be entirely male. If their offspring were capable of spreading the transgene, it could theoretically drive rats to near extirpation without the use of poison. Their incredible fecundity would finally be thwarted, and after several generations, a horde of bachelor rats would fight amongst themselves, dwindle, and disappear. I recently met up with rodent expert Bobby Corrigan in Lower Manhattan. It was one of the year’s first warm evenings, and the faint, sweet whiff of putrefying garbage filled the air. Corrigan stood in the middle of the street, watching rats dart out of a storm drain and into trash bags piled on the curb. ""You can read a city,"" Corrigan said, pointing to dark streaks leading out of the grate. They were marks left by grease from the rats' fur, soaked and rubbed onto cement from commutes back and forth along the same routes for months or years. Exterminators call them rat runways, and you can see them on the walls and curbs throughout the city. Last week, New York announced an ambitious new strategy in its war against the city’s intractable rat population. The health department is hiring 50 people, effectively doubling the staff who deals with rats. They’ll survey neighborhoods to find ""rat reservoirs,"" the hidden places where rats have been able to grow to huge numbers, causing problems in neighborhoods no matter what residents or exterminators do. ""It’s not just looking for signs of rats; it’s following rats and figuring out where they’re going,"" said Dan Kass, Deputy Commissioner for Environmental Health. Inspectors will seal up cracks in sidewalks and foundations. Exterminators will collapse burrows and poison intensively for months. Sewers will be flushed regularly, and health educators will work with neighborhoods to design better trash management programs, possibly including things like vacuum-sealed trash compactors. Population biologists will monitor progress in the area, moving on only when there’s been a sustained decline in rats. In the program’s pilot, areas near the targeted reservoirs saw an 80–90 percent drop in rat sightings, according to the department. Corrigan helped design New York City’s pilot rat program — he’s a sort of global adviser to cities trying to cope with rats. When he’s cited, which is often, it’s with the epithet ""renowned rodentologist,"" and he has the fastidious intensity of someone who spends a lot of time studying animals that thrive on sloppiness. He’s been called to battle rodents in Warsaw, Sao Paolo, Tokyo, and 46 states, but New York, he says, is ""ratropolis."" Norway rats came to New York in the 18th century and quickly swarmed the city’s docks, stables, slaughterhouses, and refuse-strewn streets. As the city’s population grew, so did the rats’. Here they have vast temperature-regulated burrows in the sewers and subways, while the city’s aging housing stock furnishes them with basements, walls, and facades to nest in. The parks supply them with plenty of soil to burrow in and a steady supply of pizza crusts and chicken bones. ""New York City is ratropolis because it’s trashopolis,"" Corrigan said. The city produces 14 million tons of garbage each year, and much of it sits out in bags on curbs or in alleyways each night, conveniently close to the catchment basins where rats dwell. And that’s just the trash that gets properly thrown away, not tossed on the sidewalk. ""I call it food shrapnel,"" Corrigan said, gesturing to the litter underneath benches in the park. ""Who’s going to set off the next grenade?"" Corrigan clipped his flashlights to his belt, slipped on a fluorescent orange vest, and put on a green hardhat. We proceeded down Worth Street, stopping occasionally so he could hop up and down in flowerbeds to cave in some burrows, trying to scare out the rats. ""This burrow is probably too big,"" he said after his foot plunged through the soil up to his ankle. ""It’s probably decades old, and they just heard me and retreated to the north quarter."" The burrows were everywhere, running under seemingly solid sidewalks, streets, and parks. ""You can see statues in parks that are starting to list because of all the burrows under them,"" Corrigan said. ""They’re disassembling the city."" Corrigan doesn’t hate rats — quite the opposite. ""I absolutely respect them, like them, admire them,"" he said. He calls them one of the most finely designed mammals nature ever created. They’re fast, able to run 7 feet per second, he said, running down a list of the rat’s strengths. They can swim and climb and squeeze through holes as small as a quarter. Their jaws are strong, exerting up to 6,000 pounds per square inch, and the enamel on their teeth is harder than iron. They’re clever, ""diabolically clever,"" Corrigan said. They breed quickly and can cram into tiny spaces. ""If you want to kill the rats in this park, you’d have to kill 96 percent or you’d be exactly where you started a year later,"" he said. And like us, they’re omnivorous, adaptable, generalists. ""This is an absolutely incredible animal,"" Corrigan told me. He’s seen rats in remote corners of Central Park, burrowing to eat earthworms, living like moles; rats stalking pigeons, dragging them into their burrows; rats raiding the Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge, eating terrapin eggs. A colleague of his reported seeing rats swimming in the Hudson, eating floating garbage and fish. ""The problem is they want our space as much as we do,"" Corrigan said. They dash along subway platforms and ride in train cars. Unsatisfied with leftovers, they venture into restaurants. They moved into the brand new Conde Nast offices, even before the editors arrived. Sometimes a rat exploring a sewer follows a smaller tunnel up and out and into the toilet bowl of terrified apartment residents. New York’s 311 program received 24,511 complaints about rats last year, up from 22,365 the year before. That represents about 40 percent of the complaints directed to the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. No one knows how many rats live in New York. The one rat per person statistic, often cited, is bogus. A grad student recently attempted a calculation based off 311 complaints and came up with 2 million, but even that’s a total ballpark. The sun had set by the time we reached Chinatown’s Columbus Park, a hotspot cited by Kass in his announcement of the reservoir program. At the park’s entrance, someone had jammed a shard of concrete into a rat burrow, ""a sign of human frustration,"" Corrigan said. Six or seven rats gathered around a styrofoam container, taking turns sticking their snouts into a hole and tossing it around, trying to get at whatever leftovers were inside. Tired of waiting, a smaller rat dashed across the sidewalk, scaled the fence, and leapt into an open garbage can. The rats of New York City are too entrenched to be eradicated: the density of the city makes a thorough patrol like Alberta’s unfeasible, and their proximity to us makes the sort of poison campaign used in South Georgia impossible: it would kill them, but it could kill us, too, and more would arrive to take their place. Instead, Corrigan said, we have to manage their population by targeting the source of their sustenance, and often that means changing human behavior. That’s a major part of the reservoir strategy: taking community leaders around to look at hotspots, working with them to rat-proof buildings, cutting down on littering, and improving waste management services. It’s a massive civic undertaking, both at the neighborhood and policy levels. Poison should be the last thing you go for, Corrigan said. Rats are a symptom of larger issues. The rats aren’t going away, Corrigan said, as we watched them standing on their burrows, watching us. ""We’re going to share the city."" As with all great pests, we like to joke that rats will outlast us. After all, they survived nuclear tests on the Marshall Islands. If anything, they're even better positioned to thrive in today’s slower, environmental apocalyptic scenarios. In a world where ecosystems are being upended, cities are growing, infrastructure is aging, and waste is increasing, the rat has all the traits necessary for success. In the Darwinian sense, the rat is just as fit for the world we’ve built as we are. Today’s rat campaigns are attempts to rein in the rare species that excels under our new rules. With enough effort, money, and technology, we may be able to control their numbers. But the thing about rats is that we always win the battles, but they tend to win the war. Undoing the work of a couple stowaway rats takes millions of dollars and months of helicopter bombardment, but it would be for naught if one pregnant rat hops off a visiting yacht. In cities, just keeping them to manageable numbers takes the work of public officials, exterminators, trash collectors, and scientists, as well as the attention of every citizen. And in Alberta, holding them at bay takes province-wide vigilance and regular border patrols. After making the rounds in the control zone, Merrill drove over the border to Saskatchewan. We drove past the burnt-out hole where an infested granary used to be, over close-cropped hills of wheat and barley, and toward a decrepit grain storage facility that sits in the bottom of a muddy valley. ""This is where they’re coming from,"" he said as we approached. ""Jeepers creepers, look at those holes."" The base of the building was riddled with burrows and surrounded by drifts of rat feces — some of it bright blue, a sign of a past poisoning attempt, clearly futile. Merrill became dismayed as he surveyed the scene, climbing up to peek in a window, kneeling to look at the foundation. He decided the building had to come down. Otherwise the rats will keep coming, and eventually some will get through the zone. Afterward, at the regional pest control headquarters, he checked his email and found some photos of dead rodents caught near Edmonton. He’d gotten the call earlier but figured someone had misidentified a gopher. They hadn’t. They were rats. Over the phone, he told the Edmonton pest control officer where to get poison and traps. Conferring with other officers, he talked about sending someone to investigate how the rats got in. ""Never a dull moment,"" he said, ruefully, testing the trigger on a shiny CO2-powered trap. Maps of the zone lined the walls of the office. A taxidermied rat sat on the shelf, baring its teeth.

The observations support a fundamental theory of particle physics, according to a paper published today in the journal Nature. It's hoped that the research will help guide future investigations into dark matter and other phenomena that the Standard Model of particle physics cannot explain. The findings are based on data collected between 2011 and 2012 at CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in Switzerland. Particle decay occurs when elementary particles spontaneously transform into other elementary particles. In the LHC experiments, protons collided at high energy to create 1 trillion particles known as neutral B mesons, some of which then decayed into pairs of oppositely charged muons — heavier ""cousins"" of electrons.  The decay of one type of B mesons, known as ""strange"" mesons, occurred at the same frequency predicted by the Standard Model (about four in 1 billion), with a confidence level high enough to qualify as a discovery. The decay of non-strange B mesons also aligned with Standard Model predictions (about one in 10 billion), albeit at a lower confidence level (99.7 percent). ""We are constraining these theories, we are not saying they are wrong."" The Standard Model of particle physics explains how the universe's fundamental particles interact through strong, electromagnetic, and weak forces — but it doesn't explain everything. Although previous experiments have supported the model with increased precision, the Standard Model still fails to account for gravity, and cannot explain the dark matter that holds galaxies together. Physicists have proposed many theories to account for these shortcomings, including supersymmetry, which posits the existence of high-mass ""superparticles"" that could account for dark matter. Neutral B meson decays, which are rare, may help account for where superparticles and other unobserved ""new physics"" phenomena come into play. CERN's researchers hope their latest findings will provide more precise limitations to help refine non-Standard Model theories. ""It can help people doing these theories to better understand which parts are correct and which parts are not,"" says Marc-Olivier Bettler, a CERN research fellow and one of the paper's authors. ""We are constraining these theories, we are not saying they are wrong. We are just telling them that they cannot cover all the space that they were covering before."" LHC's reboot holds promise for future experiments The findings announced today are based on combined results from two previous CERN experiments: one carried out by the LHCb team, and another by the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) team. Each experiment found evidence for the decay of neutral B mesons, but the researchers were only able to observe it at a high statistical significance when combining their databases. ""Both experiments on their own have published their measurements before, so in that sense it's not a surprise,"" says Philip Burrows, a professor of physics at the University of Oxford who was not involved in the CERN research. ""But it's the combined precision of the measurements which is the important thing."" The good news for CERN and other physicists is that more data is on the way. Last month, the LHC restarted after a two-year hiatus for maintenance and repairs, and its proton collisions are expected to carry twice as much energy as they did at its debut. That will result in more precise observations, experts say, and, perhaps, a blueprint to explain the vast parts of the universe that the Standard Model cannot. ""They've established the technique for measuring these rare processes, and they're going to have a whole lot more data over the next 10 to 20 years,"" Burrows says. ""And that means their measurements will get a whole lot more precise as the size of the data sample increases.""

Thing Explainer appears to keep the same style, albeit with a bit more detail and some of Munroe's stick figures thrown in. Munroe has been drawing comics for close to a decade now, but he's only recently started branching out. In 2012, he began an illustrated explainer series called What If? that answers ridiculous scientific questions with surprisingly thoughtful answers (most recently, ""Which has a greater gravitational pull on me: the Sun, or spiders?""). Munroe turned that series into a book last year. As with What If? and the XKCD comics in general, Munroe's scientific background — he was once a roboticist at NASA — continues to play a big role in allowing him to take complicated subjects and turn them into a funny and understandable format. That's clearly the case with Thing Explainer as well. It looks like the book will include around 60 diagrams in all.

""Highlights"" are below. -@VanityFair Little known fact: sex was invented in 2012 when Tinder was launched. It's disappointing that @VanityFair thought that the tiny number of people you found for your article represent our entire global userbase Next time reach out to us first @nancyjosales… that’s what journalists typically do. The Tinder Generation is real. Our users are creating it. But it’s not at all what you portray it to be. Tinder users are on Tinder to meet people for all kinds of reasons. Sure, some of them — men and women — want to hook up. Just like in real life. And in the many years that existed before Tinder. It’s about meeting new people for all kinds of reasons. Travel, dating, relationships, friends and a shit ton of marriages. Talk to the female journalist in Pakistan who wrote just yesterday about using Tinder to find a relationship where being gay is illegal. Talk to our many users in China and North Korea who find a way to meet people on Tinder even though Facebook is banned. Talk to the many Tinder couples — gay and straight — that have gotten married after meeting on Tinder. If you want to try to tear us down with one-sided journalism, well, that’s your prerogative. You could have talked about how everyone on Tinder is authenticated through Facebook. And how we show users the friends they have in common. Or you could have talked about how everyone on Tinder is on an equal playing field. Or how millions of Tinder users have connected their Instagram accounts, so potential matches can learn more about them. This all creates social accountability so that Tinder users treat each other well. Instead, your article took an incredibly biased view, which is disappointing. But it’s not going to dissuade us from building something that is changing the world. #GenerationTinder Is Kim Jong Un on Tinder?

Everyone's bitter and snarky on the internet, but no one does it with as much class, wit, and foresight as celebrated American crime novelist Raymond Chandler. In a 1953 letter to his agent H.N. Swanson, Chandler indulges in a brilliantly entertaining, paragraph-long parody of sci-fi writing, which hits every trope and cliché of the genre. Oh, and he namedrops Google some 45 years before Larry and Sergey registered the domain. Did you ever read what they call Science Fiction? It's a scream. It is written like this: ""I checked out with K19 on Adabaran III, and stepped out through the crummaliote hatch on my 22 Model Sirus Hardtop. I cocked the timejector in secondary and waded through the bright blue manda grass. My breath froze into pink pretzels. I flicked on the heat bars and the Bryllis ran swiftly on five legs using their other two to send out crylon vibrations. The pressure was almost unbearable, but I caught the range on my wrist computer through the transparent cysicites. I pressed the trigger. The thin violet glow was ice-cold against the rust-colored mountains. The Bryllis shrank to half an inch long and I worked fast stepping on them with the poltex. But it wasn't enough. The sudden brightness swung me around and the Fourth Moon had already risen. I had exactly four seconds to hot up the disintegrator and Google had told me it wasn't enough. He was right."" They pay brisk money for this crap? The ironic thing about Chandler's mockery of sci-fi is that it's enticing in its own right: I'm actually drawn in to find out more about crylon vibrations and the seven-legged Bryllis they emanate from. I'm also curious about the range-finding wrist computer, which sounds an awful lot like the smartwatches of today. But that wasn't the only time that Chandler sharply (and accurately) derided the future that was to come. In another letter, he tells his agent about the TV and movie industries, identifying problems that persist to this day: TV stinks to heaven and even the halfwits admit it, but it doesn't cost anything, and you don't have to put a shirt on and get the car out and find a place to park and sit in a badly ventilated theatre with the stink of popcorn turning your stomach. I'd like a TV show, who wouldn't, but not on any terms CBS would agree to. And if I got the kind of show I would like, it would probably flop. The private eye as such is dated. If you can't give him character and interest as a human being, you are licked. And TV can't. It hasn't the time or the talent and it is too much afraid of offending some jerk in Corn Center, Nebraska. So yes, we can add Futurist and Trenchant Media Critic to Chandler's list of accolades.",0.14990068784403388,0.8500993121559661,0.16552747445981697,484,4.6280991735537187,311,5.5112540192926049,0,0,

""Kurt Russell came in for this movie,"" Vin Diesel told Kimmel. ""But we really hired him because of a story that follows this that takes place in New York."" Russell appeared on Kimmel's show just one night later, and seemed smitten with the character he portrayed. ""We created somebody that I think is a mystery man,"" he said. ""You never know his name. You never know quite what world he’s in. And we don’t, and I think that’s what’s exciting about it."" Beyond the location, Vin Diesel didn't offer any more hints of what's to come when Dom and his pals attempt to push supercars to their limit and tear through midtown Manhattan gridlock. A blistering race through the Lincoln Tunnel or across the George Washington Bridge both seem like child's play for this franchise. Dropping cars out of airplanes just has a way of setting the bar pretty high for James Wa (should the director return for another go) and the rest of the Fast and Furious team. ""If they do more, and if it goes on, we’ll try to come up with something to top this, but I’ll tell you, it’s going to be hard to do,"" said Russell. But the beauty is you know they'll try — and probably pull it off.

Take today's launch of the Boxster Spyder, for instance: it's a stripped-down, juiced-up version of the popular little ragtop that focuses on lightness to keep the car quick. Indeed, it has both more horsepower and a better 0-60 time than a base Carrera. And truly, ""stripped down"" is an understatement: the Spyder forgoes a radio and air conditioner as standard equipment — Porsche notes that the engine is your music and the outside air is your AC — but you can option them at no additional charge, if you're hellbent on making the car heavier for the sake of your own comfort. Keeping with the theme, a true manual is the only transmission being offered. On the outside, changes are subtle but noticeable: a pair of humps on the rear deck look cool and help with the wind profile, and a manually operated soft top that folds neatly underneath — as long as you're willing to get out of the car to do it. On the back, the ""Boxster"" logo is replaced with just ""Spyder,"" which helps your Boxster-owning neighbors understand that you own a very special model indeed. The new model won't be easy to get: it'll be a limited run, starting at $82,100. That's $30,000 more than a base Boxster. Correction: In the video, I mention that the Spyder has an inline six-cylinder engine. This is obviously not correct — the Spyder, like all Boxsters, has a flat six.

If you've opted for an upgraded audio package, you might have six or eight speakers plus a subwoofer. In Lincoln's new MKX crossover, you can have up to 19 speakers, powered by two amplifiers. The MKX's sound system has been built and designed by Harman's Revel brand, and marks the first time that Revel audio has been available in a car. There are two levels of Revel audio options available in the MKX: a standard 13-speaker, single amp setup and the Revel Ultima package, which offers 19 speakers and hybrid Class D and Class A/B amplifier equipped with 20 channels. If you're going to opt for upgraded audio, you might as well go all the way.   Revel is a brand that's well known among audiophiles for its high-end home audio systems, but it's not exactly a household name. Owned by Harman, Revel systems can easily cost many thousands of dollars and employ a lot of fancy technology in the pursuit of ultimate sound quality. The MKX's custom system is no different — the hybrid amplifier was designed to provide clarity for high frequencies in the tweeters and power for the lower frequencies driven by the mid-range speakers and subs. Revel says it built the audio system around the specific dimensions of the car and dictated certain design decisions, such as the pattern of holes on the speaker grilles and how the larger speakers were mounted in the doors. The 2016 MKX is the first Lincoln vehicle to benefit from the Revel partnership, and future models will each have their own specially designed systems. The end result is a sound system that sounds pretty great The system also incorporates Harman's software technology such as Clari-Fi, which enhances low-quality streams, and QuantumLogic Surround, which can simulate different seating arrangements in a theater. Revel isn't saying exactly how much power the Ultima system puts out, but it says it's ""capable of upwards of 1,200 watts."" That's a lot of power for a system that only has to provide audio inside of a vehicle.    The end result of all of those speakers and amps and software algorithms is a sound system that, well, sounds pretty great. I sat in an MKX kitted out with the Revel Ultima package, and I can't deny that I walked away impressed. Highs are clear and distinct, without being harsh or overly sibilant, while mids are rich and warm. The power from the Class D amp pushes the lows enough that they can be felt, but they don't rattle the vehicle or overwhelm the rest of the sound. Details are still clear at low volumes, and unsurprisingly, the audio doesn't break up when pushed. It's also incredibly immersive, but not overbearing — I was able to have a conversation with Revel product manager Kevin Voecks while the system was playing at volume. Revel says the MKX's system was tuned to sound great across all genres of music, but given the MKX's likely buyer, it's probably going to be used for a lot of jazz, classical, and talk radio. All three sound flawless in the car. High-end audio systems in luxury cars are nothing new — you've been able to drop thousands of dollars on systems from Bose, JBL, Bang & Olufsen, and even Harman Kardon for years. For a brand like Revel, which only plays in the upper stratosphere of audiophile equipment, building their system into a mainstream vehicle such as the MKX will expose them to many more people than before. But don't be fooled, the Revel audio systems in the MKX won't come cheap, and for most of us, sitting in a demo at a trade show like the New York International Auto Show will probably be the only way we experience them.

In place of normal C- and D-pillars — the elements that connect the roof to the body toward the back of a car — there's a swoopy mix of metal, chrome, and glass. At a glance, the glass appears to flow uninterrupted from the side to the rear window, framed by a dagger-shaped thing dangling from the roofline. I haven't had a chance to form an opinion on it yet, but it definitely catches the eye. It's an optical illusion It's a bit of a magic trick, though: if you open the rear lid, you immediately notice that the pillars are still there — Lexus has just designed the glass to flow around them on the outside. The uninterrupted view around the back from inside the car is strictly an optical illusion, almost certainly for structural and safety reasons.

The fastest production car in the world, the Hennessey Venom GT, does it in 2.7; Lamborghini’s 602-horsepower V-10-powered Huracán has been unofficially clocked at 2.5. If you were sitting in a Huracán right now, you could go from zero to 60 in less time than it takes to read this sentence. But somewhere in a Texas garage sits a strange car that’s even quicker: a 1968 Mustang fastback known as the Zombie 222, and it’s entirely electric. Tapping an array of giant motors, controllers, and batteries — cast in a fluorescent green with blue LEDs for effect — the Zombie 222 produces over 800 horsepower and a mind-numbing 1,800 pounds of torque. Those numbers translate into a 0–60 time of just 2.4 seconds, a remarkable eighth-mile time of 6.8 seconds at 101 mph and an estimated quarter-mile time of 10.7 seconds at 125 mph. But forget numbers: smash the accelerator of the Zombie 222, and you can feel your internal organs abandon their rightful homes and fly against the back of your rib cage. That kind of acceleration will make a 5’11"", 245-pound cameraman giggle like a little boy riding his first roller coaster. That’s not hyperbole — I’ve seen it happen. The Zombie 222 is the brainchild of Mitch Medford, a muscle car enthusiast who left a career in tech to launch Bloodshed Motors, a garage that offers an unusual service: converting classic cars into high-speed electric machines that can pummel the most powerful supercars in the world. The ’68 fastback is Bloodshed’s first — and so far, only — project. Medford hopes that one day his four-wheeled creatures will be roaming streets and highways around the world, but first, he has to prove what the Zombie is made of. In late February, I traveled to Austin, Texas, to visit Medford and the Bloodshed team. It was unseasonably cold and wet, but Medford had been tinkering at the garage since 4AM. The Zombie sat hunched in the middle of the shop, its menacing green-and-black paint job immaculate, every inch of chrome polished. Medford was working feverishly to prepare for the Texas Mile, a bi-annual racing event where he hoped to demonstrate the Zombie’s mettle by breaking two speed records. The event was exactly one month away. Mitch Medford may as well have been born in an auto shop and delivered by a mechanic. He comes from a long line of mechanics and moonshiners — in fact, he’s named after Robert Mitchum, the producer, writer, and star of 1958’s Thunder Road, a seedy noir about a fast-driving illegal booze runner. At 53, Medford still has the good-humored energy of a middle school class clown: eager to tease friends, offer up a groan-worthy joke, or riff on a plot for a Fast and Furious film starring himself and the Zombie. He’s also a born storyteller, peppering his anecdotes with expressions that reveal his roots in North Carolina’s Blue Ridge Mountains — an underpowered car, he’ll tell you, ""can’t pull a greasy string out of a cat’s ass."" Medford’s love for cars started in high school, when he salvaged his first ride — a 1966 Ford LTD Galaxie 500 with a tattered vinyl roof and wires snaking out of the tires — and fixed it up with his dad. Eventually, a policeman clocked the Galaxie going 137, even though its speedometer only went up to 120. ""That car was woven into my high school years,"" Medford says. ""It’s a part of my memories of getting girlfriends and going to the drive-in movies and trying to outrun my friends down the backside of the river… It was the way we settled arguments. We’d see who could lay down the most rubber in the parking lot, who had the loudest pipes — putting on glasspacks, cherry bombs, straight pipes, cutouts. It was just seeped into my whole childhood."" Medford's steel gray hair is trimmed with military precision, a throwback to his time as a drill instructor. After the army, he turned to computer engineering, and made a successful career of it — first at IBM, then heading startups. In June of last year, Medford left his post as CEO of Austin-based RF Code to build Bloodshed Motors. In its announcement of his departure, Austin Business Journal said Medford left to ""pursue personal business opportunities."" But to Medford, Bloodshed was far more than that. After the Galaxie, other cars had come and gone: a 6-cylinder ’67 Mustang, a ’66 Impala Super Sport, two ’69 Toronados (one with a mile-wide set of horns fastened to the hood), a ‘67 Mercury Cougar (in which he first kissed his wife), a 2011 Shelby GT500 — all-American gas guzzling classics, new and old. And then Medford saw an episode of Top Gear that piqued his interest. In it, the puckish Jeremy Clarkson races a first-generation Tesla Roadster against its more conventional twin, the Lotus Elise. As the Tesla hurtles down the track, Clarkson screams, ""12,500 RPM — I cannot believe this! That’s biblically quick!"" The Tesla left its sibling sucking ozone fumes. Watching the clip, an idea banged around Medford’s head. He felt sure electric cars would transform the car industry, but he also wondered whether they could penetrate the restoration and modification car community, where wealthy buyers shell out tens of thousands to breathe new life into classic vehicles. So Medford started doing his research, and that’s when he stumbled onto John Wayland and his White Zombie.  On the outside, the White Zombie is a humble 1972 Datsun 1200. But concealed beneath its milquetoast shell sit two 9-inch electric motors, giving the White Zombie enough power to hit 60 mph in 1.8 seconds. It runs a quarter mile in 10.3 seconds — almost a whole second quicker than a Nissan GT-R. ""The power and the numbers and performance that that car was putting out was almost unimaginable,"" Medford recalls. A light bulb went off in his head and he sent John Wayland an email outlining his vision: beautifully restored, iconic vintage cars coupled with world-class electric performance. He knew it’d be a niche business and the creations wouldn’t be cheap — $200,000 and up — but he felt confident the market was ripe. With Tesla monopolizing the luxury electric car field, it was becoming harder for wealthy buyers to distinguish themselves from the crowd. Bloodshed Motors offered a solution: top-of-the-line electric performance in one-of-a-kind packages. But weeks passed with no word from Wayland. John Wayland built his first electric car in 1980 with a proto-Tesla philosophy: if electric cars have any hope of success, they needed to quicken a customer’s pulse. ""Electric cars were never going to take off if you tried to lay guilt trips on people about burning gasoline,"" he says. In 1994, a local electric vehicle club hosted a drag race on the streets of Portland to prove that electric cars weren’t a complete bore. The problem is, they were: ""Nothing but dog-slow and embarrassing,"" Wayland recalls. So he built the White Zombie. Wayland procured seven helicopter batteries from an aircraft surplus outfit and stuffed them into the diminutive Datsun. Most of the batteries were in bad shape, but the car still laid rubber in all five gears, Wayland says. ""I remember women and children running for cover as I was going sideways down the streets of Portland."" In the two decades since, Wayland added another motor and swapped out the nickel-cadmium batteries for modern lithium-manganese-nickel-cobalt polymer cells. But by the spring of 2014, Wayland had stopped tinkering with the car as much — he’d been devastated by the loss of his wife a few years prior and was keeping to himself. He remembers receiving Mitch’s email (""it was well-written, intelligent; he was very articulate""), but it took him weeks to respond. The two hit if off as soon as they got on the phone — ""it’s a good thing we’re not neighbors,"" Wayland says, ""we’d be in trouble constantly."" The concept of an all-electric muscle car wasn’t new to Wayland: in the '90s, he’d converted a ‘65 Mustang to run on lead-acid batteries. It had a range of 35 miles and a top speed of 85 mph — it was even featured in a ‘95 issue of Mustang Illustrated magazine. Wayland’s late wife loved Mustangs, and he thought Medford’s was the right project to get back in the game. ""It was a marriage meant to be,"" he says. Medford knew from the start that Bloodshed Motors’ debut project had to be a first-generation Mustang. The Mustang needs no introduction, but its significance in the saga of American motor history cannot be overstated. It was an instant classic after its introduction in 1964, firmly woven into the cultural fabric of its era. If Medford wanted to attract buyers with fat checkbooks, he’d have to electrify the vehicle that stood at the very heart of American automotive culture, and the original pony car was it. To handle the kind of power Medford was envisioning, he needed a rust-free, wreck-free small-block fastback (he was reticent to take a rarer big-block off the market) and found one in Houston. In the meantime, he assembled the core Bloodshed crew: John Wayland would act as mentor and guide; Jack Lapenta, Medford’s longtime friend and colleague at IBM, would manage electronics; and Allen Koester, an electrician by trade and a talented mechanic, would be in charge of everything else. Early last summer, Wayland and his partner Mark Mongillo drove down from Oregon, and the team spent a month tearing out the Mustang’s internal combustion engine, replacing it with dual 11-inch electric motors and two controllers to manage the battery packs (the ""222"" in Zombie 222 stands for ""two engines, two controllers, and too damn fast""). For Koester the mechanic, that meant fabricating sturdier motor mounts and installing frame rails to keep the car’s body from twisting under the strain of 1,800 pounds of torque. For Lapenta the electrician, it meant figuring out a way to monitor, regulate, and care for a system that could safely harness enough energy to briefly power a few hundred homes. The Zombie’s first incarnation was massively overpowered. Through an acquaintance, the team got hold of drag racing legend Don ""Big Daddy"" Garlits’ battery pack. Garlits made a name for himself breaking 200 miles per hour on a quarter-mile strip in 1964. Now in his 80s, Garlits wants to be the first to do the same in an electric powered dragster. Accordingly, his battery pack produces 1.5 megawatts, equivalent to roughly 2,000 horsepower. That’s enough electric muscle to trigger what Lapenta calls a ""catastrophic event."" ""If something goes wrong,"" Lapenta says, ""it doesn’t just burn things, it vaporizes [them] instantly."" To avert disaster, the team installed what it calls the ""‘Oh Shit’ lever,"" which instantly disconnects the battery from the drivetrain. After multiple all-nighters, the crew finally had the Zombie in one piece and trucked it down to a San Antonio drag strip for a terrifying round of tests. Medford asked Wayland to take the wheel for the first drive. ""I’m not easily scared in a car,"" Wayland recalls, ""and it was one of the scariest rides I’ve ever done."" As soon as Wayland punched the accelerator, the Zombie’s front end leapt into the air. It came down, but bucked again at 60 miles per hour. ""It had a buttload of power, but it wasn’t properly set up,"" Wayland remembers. In their rush, the team had neglected to fasten critical components or align the steering. A second run was equally treacherous. ""We proved it had a lot of power; it excited the crowd — it excited everybody,"" Wayland says. ""But I probably should’ve worn a set of Depends on the two runs."" Every Friday afternoon, a few miles down the road from Bloodshed Motors, Sandeez Hamburger Hut hosts an impromptu classic car meet-up. On the morning of my visit, Medford offered to check it out, so we hopped in the Zombie. The car had come a long way since the San Antonio runs: the steering system was honed, and Medford has installed the first of two overdrives, which will extend his top speed — in theory — to roughly 200 miles per hour. The Zombie is high-tech, but it’s not a refined driving experience — it lacks the silken comfort of a Tesla or the luxury you’d expect from a car with its price tag. The racing battery pack currently installed had a charge time of 45 minutes, and only offered a 40–50 mile range. There’s no power steering, and the brakes are heavy. The car feels stiff, tense with power. At high speeds or tight turns, the steady whine of the electric engine is joined by wind noise and creaks from the frame. But the Zombie was built for performance, not promenades. Drop your foot on the pedal, and the car transforms into a missile. Power flows to the drivetrain effortlessly, and the car jumps from 10 mph to 30 as gracefully as from 60 to 90. ""This car is the most exciting thing I’ve ever driven in my life,"" says Medford. ""It’s literally like crack cocaine."" As we turned onto the highway toward Sandeez, Mitch leaves six-foot-long tire tracks. Apart from a lonely silver Chevrolet SSR, the parking lot around Sandeez on that bone-chillingly cold morning was largely devoid of interesting cars. Medford popped the Zombie’s hood and trunk, revealing the motor and battery pack, and stepped inside the restaurant. He’d baited the trap and watched as passersby craned their necks to figure out just what it was they were looking at. The driver of the SSR — an older gentleman — circled the Zombie. He looked under the hood, sauntered to the back, and stared into the trunk. He considered the car a moment longer. Finally, he shook his head, muttered, ""It’s fucking cold,"" and headed inside. ""Let’s face it,"" Medford told me later, ""growing up with muscle cars — why did we make them loud? To get attention. Why did we try to make them faster? To be the guy that wins…and gets the attention."" And with the Zombie, Medford built the ultimate conversation piece. Sometimes he says he sticks GoPros in the engine bay, props open the hood, and leaves the Zombie at a Home Depot parking lot. Then, he watches people’s faces as they crane their heads over the electric motors. ""To be totally candid,"" he says, ""it’s an amazingly addictive feeling."" But admiration won’t pay the bills. Medford will need customers, and to attract them he needs to establish Bloodshed as a business. That’s why he’s headed to the Texas Mile, a biannual event where drivers are invited to hurtle their machines down a runway to see just how fast they can go. The Texas Mile draws million-dollar vehicles, big buyers, and thousands of spectators. ""If we’re going to focus on building a brand that represents extremely high-performance electric vehicle conversions of classic iconic cars, we’ve got to really prove it,"" Medford told me. To do that, he aims to break two records: the first is for fastest electric street car at the Texas Mile. John Metric, the president of the National Electric Drag Racing Association, currently holds that record at 155 miles per hour for a run he did in 2012 in his highly modified Pontiac Fiero. The second record is unofficial, but for Medford, it carries greater personal significance. In 1967, Carroll Shelby — an icon of American muscle as big as the Mustang itself — was invited by Goodyear to its San Angelo, Texas testing facility to demonstrate the durability of their new Thunderbolt tires. Shelby took the opportunity to outfit what was already a very quick pony — the Shelby GT500 — with a race-ready 427 big block engine and christen it the ""Super Snake."" The day of the run, Shelby’s car ran 500 miles at an average speed of 142 miles per hour. At one point, the story goes, the Super Snake hit 170, making it the fastest first-generation Mustang in the world. For Medford, Shelby is an inspiration as much for his racing prowess as his business acumen. ""In a way he was ahead of the whole world in the resto mod business,"" Medford said. ""Think about his business: he aligned himself with Ford, took their products, and made them better than they ever would be, and still got them repaired and warrantied by Ford. That’s inspiration."" And like Medford, Shelby knew marketing was key — in the ‘60s, Shelby allegedly repainted his only Cobra different colors in order to fool the world into thinking he had a full inventory. ""The man, the legend has shown it’s possible,"" said Medford. ""If you want to say that you’re going to put the ultimate muscle in a muscle car, you better be able to outdo the man who represented ultimate muscle."" But Medford knew 170 was a reach — the fastest he’d gone was somewhere in the 120s. He had no idea what would happen when he pushed a 60-year-old car beyond its limits. ""I’m gonna hold that pedal down until my nut sack pops,"" he shrugged. ""You may watch me die down there,"" he added, half-jokingly. ""Just take care of my wife."" Twice a year, the town of Beeville — population 13,000 — welcomes the Texas Mile and the fleet of high-performance cars and motorcycles that come with it. The three-day event takes place on a one-and-a-half-mile runway located on the decommissioned Chase Naval Airfield, surrounded by wide open country on one side and the Garza East Unit correctional facility on the other. The prison is close enough that guards can watch — and inmates can hear — cars howling down the drag strip. And it’s a true Texan affair. ""We always say our event is in honor of God and country,"" says Shannon Matus, co-founder and owner of the event, when we sit down to talk in her trailer. Matus has the robust mane and warm smile of a classic country singer. Each daily driver meeting starts with a prayer, she tells me, and a couple dozen members of the Christian Motorcyclist Association volunteer their time here every year. ""I always tell them, ‘You’re here to provide direction,’"" Matus says. ""…and hopefully the opportunity comes up where you can provide the real important direction."" Apart from John Wayland — whose plans were derailed by an emergency repair on Michael Jordan’s high-performance electric golf cart somewhere in Las Vegas — the entire Bloodshed crew showed up for the Mile. As Shelbys, Lamborghinis, Ferraris, Porsches, Camaros, Ford GTs, and Nissan GT-Rs roll by the Zombie’s trailer on their way to the track, drivers poked their heads out to see what the ever-constant crowd was gawking at. There are other classic cars here, but nothing even remotely resembles the Zombie. Medford was less jovial than he’d been a month ago, and the Zombie was meaner than ever: the sideview mirrors and windshield wipers were gone, an aluminum plate hid the grill and headlights, two blowers were installed to cool the engine, and a wing had been attached to keep the car grounded. Power came from a 1.1-megawatt battery pack, capable of producing 1,400 horsepower. The two records Medford wanted to beat — 155 and 170 — had become a rallying point for his team, gathering gravity and significance over the last month. The team knew the car had enough brute force to hit 200, but they were concerned about its aerodynamics. If supercars have anything in common, it’s that they’re wedge-shaped to slice through wind. A Mustang has the aerodynamics of a cinder block. At high speeds, that profile can be dangerous: enough lift can levitate the front of the car, causing the driver to lose all control. And there are other dangers, too. As John Wayland put it, hitting 170 — or even 155 — is dependent on a lot of ifs: ""if the motors don’t fireball; if the brushes don’t melt; if we don’t break a rear end; if we don’t go sideways. […] I’m rooting for him 100 percent. I’m not saying he won’t do 170 — all I’m saying is that it’s a lofty goal."" But Medford was ready. The Texas Mile is a first-come, first-serve, one-car-at-a-time event; it can be a three-hour wait between runs. At 7:30AM on Friday morning — the sun still inching over the horizon — dozens of cars were already lined up. Medford pulled the Zombie into line. There’s a rhythm here: as one car screams down the runway, the next burns out, warming up its tires and getting them sticky for better traction. A speed board instantaneously illustrates a car’s half-mile and full-mile speeds. In a herd of cars that belch, rumble, and moan at the start line (""there’s a misconception here,"" Matus told me, ""that the louder a car is, the faster it goes"") the Zombie stood out for its silence. When the time came, Medford slid the car into position and offered the crowd a glorious, white, cotton-candy-thick burnout. And then, with little fanfare and only the sound of the vehicle tearing through the wind, Medford was off on his first run. He hit a top speed of 154.9, only a tenth of a mile slower than Metric’s record. ""Now I know we’re going to break [it],"" Medford said after the run. ""Now, 170? I don’t know."" The team felt confident enough in the car’s geometry to take the wing off and up the voltage from 190 to 205. On his second run, Medford hit 166.6, breezing through Metric’s record but just short of the all-important 170 figure. Medford was ready to call it a day — and save challenging Shelby for the next two days — but his team was wired. By the time he rolled the car back to the trailer, Allen Koester had the generator prepped to charge. The crew bumped the voltage up again, this time to the battery pack’s limit of 219 volts. As the day drew to a close, Medford pulled up to the start line for one final run. Medford gripped the wheel and tore down the line, the accelerator pressed flat. The electric motors spun furiously — he later told me the noxious odor of charred ozone filled the cabin. But he didn’t let up. By the time he hit the half-mile mark, the Zombie was flying at 156.2 miles per hour. From where I stood at the start line, the car turned into a black speck, and then vanished. Moments later, a magical number flashed across the speed board: exactly one mile from the start line, the Zombie 222 hit 174.2 miles per hour. Just like that, almost a year of hard work had paid off: Bloodshed motors had created what may be the fastest ‘68 fastback Mustang ever, electric or otherwise. Back at the trailer, the team was abuzz with high fives and congratulations. As Medford pulled up, Koester and Lapenta leaned into the car, clasping him by the shoulders. Medford was giddy again, as lighthearted as I’d seen him on my visit to Austin. ""I’m ecstatic, I’m proud,"" he said beaming. ""I’m grateful for everything, I’m grateful for these guys,"" he pointed back to the crew. ""If this doesn’t sell the vision of ultrahigh performance vintage cars that are all electric, what will?"" Medford asked me, still clutching the official speed ticket in his hand. ""If this isn’t the ultimate muscle in a muscle car, then what is?"" Within minutes of breaking Shelby’s record, Medford’s mind was already racing with possibilities. ""We’re so close to 180,"" he said laughing, ""… and once you get to 180, then it’s 190."" By Saturday morning, Medford had decided that at this October’s Texas Mile, he intended to take the Zombie to 200 miles per hour. The Zombie 222 is a singular accomplishment, but Bloodshed isn’t one car — it’s a company, and it still has something to prove. Despite the team’s success at the track, a $200,000-plus electric muscle car with limited range, no matter how fast it is, still feels like a tough sell — or maybe the perfect car, but for an exceptionally small market. That doesn’t bother Medford. ""I’m still looking for my first customer,"" Medford told me, pointing across the landscape of trailers, many with six-figure cars inside. ""And there’s a lot of money at this track."" When most of the crew drove back to Austin, Medford stayed to tell anyone who would listen about the Zombie — to talk watts and voltage with gearheads accustomed to discussing carburetors and transmissions. On the last day of the Texas Mile, Medford texted me more good news: the Zombie had won ""Hottest Car of the Texas Mile"" and ""Most Exotic Car of the Texas Mile."" I was fact-checking some figures, so I took the opportunity to verify his estimated quarter-mile time. We’d used the same calculator, but had come up with different results. We had a brief back and forth, but in the end, he said he didn’t much care what time I used. ""Doesn’t matter,"" he wrote, ""go with whatever you want. We’re going to break it soon.""

Not much changed with the redesigned iOS 7, with the exception of an animated clock icon, but designer Jay Machalani has created a concept that overhauls this static experience and transforms the app icons that fill the iPhone’s home screen.  Machalani’s vision for fixing Windows 8 turned out to be remarkably similar to what Microsoft eventually said it would do to the Start Menu, and it even earned him a visit to the company’s headquarters in Redmond, Seattle. Now the 20-year-old self-taught user-experience designer has turned his sights to Apple’s iOS mobile operating system, and he has big ideas. The key to changing anything with iOS is minimalism, consistency, and refinement. Apple is the master of refinement: a company that often borrows ideas from rivals that haven’t been implemented well and makes them shine. iOS 7 introduced sharper, flatter icons, and slimmer fonts alongside some new features, but the overall functionality was very similar to iOS 6. It made longtime iPhone users comfortable, but it hasn’t changed the fundamental UI of rows of app icons on the home screen. Machalani thinks he has the answer, and he’s using ideas from Google and Microsoft to make it happen. The concept is an approach that attempts to mix the best of Android’s widgets system with the design and functionality of Windows Phone’s Live Tiles. ""iOS Block"" is the result, a method to turn a simple app icon into a larger block that’s animated and interactive. ""You can interact with a Block and actually do stuff with it,"" explains Machalani. ""But, you can also access the application directly from the Block since it is the app itself, not a separate entity."" Instead of completely redesigning the iOS home screen with an unfamiliar interface, Machalani is simply refining it and offering some customizations for those who want more than just icons. It’s the kind of evolutionary design that might make sense for Apple to bring to life at some point in future, and work on the concept has been carried out over the past several months ahead of a rumored debut of iOS 8 at Apple’s WWDC developer conference next week. It looks natural and in keeping with the design and functionality of iOS as it stands today, and looking at ""iOS Block"" for the first time you might be forgiven for thinking it’s a leaked feature from iOS 8. The concept works by expanding your fingers on an existing app icon to get a Block with information like weather forecasts, calendar appointments, and music controls. You can then pinch it back to a normal icon, or place it permanently alongside other icons on the home screen. Machalani has created three sizes: iPhone, iPad in portrait, and iPad in landscape orientation. You can have multiple Blocks on a home screen, and the iPad versions leverage the additional space on a tablet display. Each Block is interactive, delivering live information from your text message history on the Messaging app, or appointments for the Calendar app. Machalani has also created a ""swiping and consulting zone"" inside each Block that lets you swipe across horizontally to see more information, and tapping on an icon in the lower-left corner of each Block will take you directly into the app. It’s really designed to let iPhone and iPad users see the information contained within apps at a glance. ""This would only be the first step to really push iOS forward, but a crucial one to really offer a better solution than opening and closing every single application,"" says Machalani. Machalani’s concept is very much a work in progress. The blocks take up roughly the space of 2 x 2 icons on the iPhone and iPad, and it’s not clear how Block creation would affect and push down other icons and Blocks on a home screen. There’s also a control or tap zone next to the icon on a Block, allowing developers to add tiny buttons or controls for music apps like Spotify where you could potentially control song playback from the home screen. Both of these aspects could be disorientating or frustrating, and Machalani is now inviting developers to imagine what they would want from a Block. He has some guidelines set up to maintain the iOS consistency, but it’s clear this isn’t the ideal solution just yet. Until Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference kicks off next week, it’s impossible to know whether the iPhone maker is even considering such a plan for iOS 8. With constant rumors of a larger iPhone 6, ""iOS Blocks"" might seem like a logical way to make use of a bigger display. Apple could also wait for the next iOS iteration, or overhaul its home screen in different ways, but hopefully it is planning something. iOS is comfortable and a little stale, and a boost to the main way you interact with apps could be just what it needs. Concept images and video courtesy Jay Machalani. More examples of Jay Machalani's iOS concepts can be found on his website.   An example Music Block lets you see what’s playing and control the playback straight from the homescreen. Each iOS Block has a visible icon, control zone for buttons, and the main content area for swiping and glancing at information. Blocks would finally present ""ambient information"" on the iPhone and iPad iOS users can pick between using just Blocks or a mix of Blocks and traditional icons. On an iPad the iOS Blocks make use of more screen real estate, but the smaller iPhone versions are just as functional. Mixing Blocks and icons on the iPad The end result on an iPhone.

AutoCAD maker Autodesk and creative marketing agency Steelblue did just that, however, with this massive, incredibly detailed 3D print of San Francisco’s SOMA neighborhood. All told, it encompases more than 115 city blocks, mainly in the northeast part of San Francisco’s 7-by-7 mile footprint.  The map covers a number of the city’s landmarks, including AT&T Park (home of the Giants), the Bay Bridge, and the San Francisco Ferry Building — but perhaps more importantly, it covers what is probably the city’s most rapidly changing area in terms of real estate. The 3D print was designed for real estate developer Tishman Speyer to help the company with urban planning and construction decisions — each block of the map can be picked up and replaced to help developers see exactly what new construction will look like in the context of the neighborhood. In fact, a section of the map shows SOMA not as it is now, but as it’ll look in 2017 when a number of major construction projects are finalized. The model becomes really useful with the addition of a projector mounted over the map: developers can overlay data like street maps, future subway lines, traffic patterns, or simply color outlines to highlight different parts of the city. Right now, that involves a pretty elaborate setup, with the projector mounted high above on the ceiling, but Autodesk and Steelblue also built a translucent prototype, which would allow images to be projected from below the map.  Beyond its utility for developers and urban planners, the map is an impressive piece of art in its own right — there’s an incredible amount of detail in each of the dozens of blocks that make up this part of San Francisco. I happen to live in an area captured by the map, and the amount of detail poured into the buildings that I see every day when walking around the city truly brings the model to life. The print was done at a resolution of 16 microns, which made reproducing minute details possible — you can pick out individual seating sections in AT&T Park, for example. Right now, there’s only one copy of the map, and it’ll be in possession of the real estate developer whom it was built for — but Autodesk plans to print another and have it available for viewing at its gallery. Steelblue and Autodesk also have plans to print other cities — and possibly expand on the San Francisco map, as well. We’ll have to see how they’ll tackle the city’s famous up-and-down topography, however — most neighborhoods in San Francisco are a lot hillier than SOMA.   The view from AT&T Park, looking north towards San Francisco's financial district. AT&T Park, in detail. The model is detailed enough that you can see individual seating sections (though sadly there's no bases on the field). SOMA and San Francisco's financial district. Each city block is its own model, allowing them to be removed and replaced easily as the area develops. Using a projector mounted over the model, designers can easily highlight specific areas of the city. More in-depth shading options let designers call attention to specific areas of the neighborhood. Street names can be easily projected onto the map, helping viewers get their bearings. This overlay shows the old highway that was demolished after the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. That demolition opened up a huge amount of real estate for development, leading to the SOMA we know now. The level of detail on each block is remarkable — the model was printed at a resolution of 16 microns. A smaller, alternate prototype built with a clear material. This would allow projections to be lit up from below rather than above. An overhead view of one of San Francisco's fastest-growing areas.

The iconic artist has been crafting his unique brand of science fiction imagery for decades, and it's all based on physical sensations he's experienced, whether through lucid dreaming or meditation. It's the feeling of weightlessness, of floating, in particular that gives way to his art, which has been collected into a new volume dubbed Beyond the Horizon. ""The images arise with the sensation, which, I have to say, quickly translates into simple joy,"" he explains. Born in London in 1948, Harris is less well known than contemporaries like Chris Foss or Roger Dean, but has carved out a space for himself with his surreal, vivid paintings of sci-fi scenes. His work regularly depicts strange floating structures and colliding celestial bodies. His early passion for the genre eventually led to a job painting covers for author Philip Dunn's trilogy Cities in Flight, and in 1985 he was commissioned by NASA to illustrate a rocket launch. His work has since been used by a who's who of sci-fi legends, from Isaac Asimov to Jack Vance. Over the years he's maintained a consistent yet unique style — once you're familiar with it, it's easy to recognize Harris' work. But he doesn't really see it that way.   ""It always puzzles me when this issue of style comes up, because I don't consciously have a style,"" he explains. ""This is not being disingenuous. I simply try to paint what is in my mind's eye. If people recognize my style, maybe what they are seeing is simply a feeling or vision that is personal to me. Maybe that is why it appears to withstand fashion — because it isn't a fashion."" Of course, he's also a product of his time, a generation where rock 'n' roll and drug culture influenced many artistic pursuits. It was a time when spending half of a decade seeking spiritual awareness wasn't so crazy. This, combined with his love of sci-fi, was profoundly influential. ""I think most of my generation felt it,"" he says. ""It was the zeitgeist and art colleges brewed it, particularly in the UK. For many, Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey epitomized that mood and the enigmatic yet upbeat ending said it all. ""There's a future out there, unknowable, but thrilling. After all this time, I still feel it."" Harris' love of modern sci-fi has waned a bit — ""to be honest I rarely read it any more,"" he explains — but his passion for the genre as a whole remains intact. To this day he's still painting crazy planets and spaceships that he dreamed up while meditating. Among other active projects, his ongoing series ""The Secret History of the Earth"" is a sort of visual poem, using satellite imagery as an inspiration for beautiful images of the gritty details of our planet. Never has a dusty desert surface been filled with so much wonder. ""I can't imagine where it will lead or what it will be like,"" he says of the series. His new book provides a fantastic primer for that long and varied career, along with some great insight into his process. For Harris himself, it was also an excellent way to put his decades of work into perspective. ""I can see where I am. Part of a continuation of English romanticism, thrown into the future. I'm happy with that.""      ",0.8971446863589075,0.10285531364109246,0.15277810678149295,579,4.6822107081174442,360,5.7277777777777779,0,7,"Culture, Design, Photo Essay, Report"

Twenty years ago, the PlayStation was a skunkworks product that a renegade faction within Sony had just fought to get released. Now here we are in 2015, and Sony CEO Kaz Hirai — a former boss of the PlayStation division — has announced that the company is essentially going to stop trying to grow its consumer electronics businesses beside the PlayStation 4. The PlayStation isn’t only Sony’s last great product; it might as well be Sony’s only product.  Sony is The PlayStation Company. Sony has always been the crown jewel of Japan’s once-dominant technology industry. The company made beautifully designed, highly profitable devices in just about every category imaginable and imagined a few categories of its own. But the one invention with the potential to unify the company — the internet — proved to be its undoing. Sony botched the shift to digital music, it missed the move to smartphones and tablets, and has consistently failed to create a compelling ecosystem for its products. Now the smartphone — other companies’ smartphones, usually — has replaced almost everything it sells. PlayStation is different. To be clear, the PS4 is the only truly compelling product that Sony sells today. That’s not to say it’s the only good product — almost everything the company makes is at least fit for purpose. But the PS4 is the only Sony product with genuine differentiation. Everything about its launch was textbook; Sony created a sleek, powerful, affordable console and targeted it right at the heart of a clear demographic while Microsoft sank its own credibility with boneheaded decision after decision. Today, the PlayStation brand stands for the cool, futuristic gaming experience as much as it ever did in the '90s. The PS4 isn't a do-everything box — it is simply ruthlessly efficient at what it is intended to do, offering unbeatable performance and design for the price. The Xbox One will continue to do fine in North America, but Sony is right back at the forefront of the colossal video games industry.  Sony moved out of the flagging Windows PC market last year, and yesterday Hirai said that he would not ""rule out"" doing the same with its TV and mobile divisions. That would be shocking to many, but it’s encouraging to see Hirai even consider it. Sony should stop selling smartphones — it’s too reliant on Google, and with even Samsung fading, the premium Android market just isn’t fertile ground for anyone. Sony should stop selling TVs — it sounds unthinkable, but there’s little profit or incentive for the company to remain in the industry since it sold its LCD panel division to form part of Japan Display. And, though the company just announced it will spin off its audio and video business into a subsidiary, Sony should stop selling Walkmans, Blu-ray players, and countless other inconsequential distractions altogether — it’s consistently failed to exploit the potential of having fingers in every pie. What Sony needs to do is focus on the people that want to give it money: that means Apple and Xiaomi, which buy its image sensors; that means moviegoers and music fans, who (along with Japanese life insurance customers) have propped up the company’s bottom line for years; and yes, that means gamers, the only group who appears to believe that Sony remains relevant in consumer electronics. What would a PlayStation-first Sony look like? It would need to be a lot smaller, for one thing. Games consoles are unlikely to be a growth business again — Sony itself created the most successful one of all time over 15 years ago. The PlayStation 2 sold 155 million units, sank Sega, and nearly knocked out Nintendo for good. The PlayStation 3 sold around 80 million units, though, as Nintendo’s Wii swept up the casual audience, which now appears to have abandoned dedicated devices altogether for mobile. There is absolutely a core base of people who will remain willing to pay for games consoles, but it’s limited in size. There’s a big difference between selling the PlayStation 4 and the PlayStation 2, however. With the PS2, Sony sold the console at a loss and could only make money on disc-based software sales. With the PS4, which features a less esoteric internal design, Sony is making a little money on the hardware already and has far more potential revenue streams from PlayStation Network. Its PlayStation Plus subscription service, which is now required to play games online, is one example. More software titles themselves are bought through the digital storefront these days, along with their potentially lucrative downloadable content. And although both are far from proven, further growth could come from nascent initiatives like PlayStation Vue and PlayStation Now. Ultimately, it doesn’t matter all that much how many PlayStation 4 consoles Sony can sell. What matters is who it sells them to: ideally dedicated, repeat consumers that will continue to spend throughout the lifecycle of the system. That’s why the PS4’s explicit focus on gamers was so perfectly calculated; Microsoft may have lost some of its best customers with its blunders that ensured the Xbox One conversation revolved around price, DRM, and TV features that no-one wanted. The PS4 isn’t a particularly ambitious or original device, but it’s a very well-conceived one. So yes, Sony should focus on PlayStation. It should make the PS4 as good at serving its gamer niche as it possibly can. It should continue fostering good relationships with indie developers so that when the next Minecraft comes along, it’ll be on a Sony platform. And it should cut away — or at least spin off — all the chaff. There are things worth keeping around, of course — the impressive Alpha camera line has clear synergy with the profitable image sensor division, for example, and Sony’s recent efforts to engender a more fluid, grassroots approach to product development could well pay dividends in the long run. But right now, Sony has no business being in the mobile business, or the TV business, or much of the consumer electronics business. Continuing to concentrate on phones and other products actually makes the PlayStation experience worse for most people. Take the PS4’s ability to stream games to mobile devices — a killer feature needlessly limited to the PS Vita and Sony’s Xperia Android line. Why can’t I play Destiny on my iPad when the TV’s occupied? The iOS PlayStation app, meanwhile, is a confusing mess that hasn’t even been updated for the iPhone 6. These sound like minor points, but imagine what Sony could do if everyone at the company were focused on making its most important product as good as possible.

Jo Seong-jin, head of LG's home appliances division, is accused of deliberately damaging four Samsung Crystal Blue washing machines at a Berlin trade show in September. Two other LG execs have been indicted on similar charges. LG says the washing machines are just poorly made This luxury laundry dispute has been rumbling for months. LG initially agreed to pay for the damage back in September, but Samsung filed a lawsuit later in the month citing property damage and defamation. LG, in turn, countersued, complaining of evidence tampering. LG also turned to the court of public opinion by releasing the above video, showing edited surveillance footage of the September incident. The nine-minute video shows Jo and other LG employees inspecting the appliances in plain sight of uniformed Samsung personnel hired for the event. Jo's lawyer Ham Yoon-keun says there is not enough evidence to warrant a conviction. In a statement to WSJ, Ham said, ""It is questionable whether there is sufficient evidence to prove that the president of a global company deliberately destroyed the machines where employees of the competing company were present.""

But not everyone using the site ascribes to this folksy philosophy. Others, such as Alicia Shaffer, are using Etsy like eBay, buying items wholesale from huge retailers such as Alibaba, and reselling them through the site. Shaffer claims her store, ThreeBirdNest, earns her just shy of a million dollars a year. The second-most successful store on the entire site, Shaffer's store sells clothing and accessories — socks, headbands, boot cuffs, and T-shirts with slogans such as ""Feed me and tell me I'm pretty."" ThreeBirdNest advertises its products as ""handmade boutique"" fashion, but Shaffer hasn't got to the top alone. She employs a team of 15 women who help sew some of the items in her store, and controversially, a number of the other products are bought wholesale from retailers in India. ThreeBirdNest earns its creator just short of a million dollars a year The resale of wholesale items is common for sellers on eBay, Amazon, and other e-commerce sites, but Shaffer's business model has attracted criticism from other Etsy sellers and shoppers who argue that the site, with its focus on homemade crafts, is not the place for such tactics. The site's struggle is one of handcrafted idealism versus cut-throat capitalism — despite its charm, Etsy is a marketplace that pitches cute knitted animals against each other in a fierce fight to draw more eyeballs and money. ThreeBirdNest might not follow Etsy's projected philosophy, but it does make money — profit margins for such items, Shaffer told Fast Co. Design, are around 65 percent. There are examples with even higher markups: a pair of lace socks appear in her store for $28. The same socks are also available from Chinese retail giant Alibaba's eBay-esque marketplace Aliexpress for around $6 a pair. Shaffer pins much of ThreeBirdNest's success on savvy marketing. By buying cheap wholesale items, using her in-house team to make alterations as necessary, and then using a model to show them worn in the US with complementary clothing, the wholesale goods are turned from cheap socks into boutique must-haves. Certainly it's a commercial approach that has allowed Shaffer to climb to the top of the table while others have a trickier time. Etsy made $895 million in 2012 alone, but the spread of that wealth was uneven: in a report published in 2013, Etsy said 65 percent of its sellers reported making less than $100 a year from their stores, while the median income for a full-time Etsy seller's household was $44,900, $5,100 below the national average at the time.",0.610472330629791,0.389527669370209,0.838718838331118,448,5.0558035714285712,263,6.0190114068441067,0,0,"Business, Culture, Web"

When the solar panel company went under in 2011, defaulting on a $535 million loan guarantee from the Department of Energy, it became the name Republicans would invoke whenever they wanted to attack government support for renewable energy. Well, now solar is booming, and one of the biggest companies around is moving into Solyndra’s old digs. SolarCity has leased the 200,000-square-foot Solyndra facility and is turning it into the R&D headquarters for its new manufacturing arm, according to the Silicon Valley Business Journal. It’s just the latest move in SolarCity’s foray into panel manufacturing, which began in earnest last year with the purchase of Silevo and continued with the construction of a new factory in Buffalo, New York, which the company says will produce a gigawatt’s worth of panels a year. Because Elon Musk chairs SolarCity (his cousins Lyndon and Peter Rive are CEO and CTO, respectively), the project is sometimes called Musk’s other gigafactory — the first being Tesla’s giant battery factory under construction in Nevada. ""This is completely new for them."" ""This is completely new for them,"" says Shyam Mehta, an analyst for GTM Research, who characterizes the move into manufacturing as ""a bold decision."" But is it too bold? ""It’s very tough to say right now whether it’s a stroke of genius or unnecessary,"" Mehta says. SolarCity was founded in 2006 and has been growing fast, expanding to control 39 percent of the residential solar market. (It announces its latest quarterly earnings later today.) But SolarCity doesn’t make solar panels. Instead, it installs them on people’s roofs for free, then leases the panels for less than they’d pay for energy from the grid, selling any excess back to utilities. It’s proven to be a successful model, partly because SolarCity was able to ride the plummeting cost of panels, driven by large scale production in China, that caused problems for so many American companies trying to produce their own. Here’s a chart of falling solar costs by AllianceBernstein’s Michael Parker and Flora Chang, who call it the terrordome, I guess because it sounds cool, and because the rapid drop in solar prices looks like falling off a cliff. (It’s utility-scale solar in developing markets, but the trend is true globally.)   SolarCity has given several reasons for its move into manufacturing. When the company purchased Silevo and announced the New York factory, Musk said it was because he sees a panel shortage coming and wants to guarantee supply. An American factory would also hedge against increased tariffs on Chinese imports, something that’s been threatened in the past. SolarCity also hopes that Silevo can produce a more efficient panel, which is of particular importance for residential installations, where roof space is limited. When Musk announced the purchase of Silevo, he said the high-efficiency panels will make solar ""way cheaper"" than power from fossil fuels. Musk says high-efficiency panels will make solar ""way cheaper"" than fossil fuels SolarCity’s strength as a panel installer also gives SolarCity and advantage as it moves into manufacturing, Mehta says. They’ll have a ready market for any panels they make. Vertical integration is clearly something that Musk is aiming for: he says Tesla will soon be making batteries for the home and that these batteries will come with SolarCity units. It’s a step toward a distributed power grid in which Tesla and SolarCity control power generation, storage, and the cars that use that energy. Panel manufacturing would be a major component in that chain. Aside from competition from existing panel manufacturers, SolarCity also faces the risk of diminishing federal subsidies. The federal Investment Tax Credit is worth up to 30 percent of a project’s cost, and it’s scheduled to drop to 10 percent by the end of 2016. That drop will affect large utility-scale projects more than residential ones, which SolarCity deals with, and given the decline in panel prices, solar is rapidly becoming competitive on its own. ""Things have changed fundamentally in the last three or four years,"" Mehta says. ""The economics of solar are so good that people are putting it up in countries without any subsidies."" Even the loan program that funded Solyndra is turning a profit Almost 4 gigawatts of solar panel projects came online in the US during the first three quarters of last year, according to Solar Energy Industries Association, up from 2.65 GW in the same period of  2013. According to GTM, the US solar industry completed a project every two and a half minutes last year. Growth was lead by residential solar — the sort of projects SolarCity specializes in — which put about 200,000 units on rooftops, four times the number installed in 2011. Even the loan program that funded Solyndra is now turning a profit, which it was never meant to do. As for the move into Solyndra's office, Mehta says it makes sense. The infrastructure is there already — all the clean rooms and waste management facilities a panel developer would need. Tesla’s factory is just two miles up the road, which will help as the two companies become increasingly linked, and it’s close enough to the Bay Area to lure the researchers it needs to develop its panels. ""A lot of solar panel manufacturers usually put their R&D pretty much next to panel manufacturing site, but it’s a lot easier to get people in Silicon Valley than getting them to move to snowy Buffalo,"" Mehta says.",0.6076171217411415,0.39238287825885854,0.8555275225742198,917,5.125408942202835,475,6.1831578947368424,0,2,"Business, Report"

The truth, however, is more nuanced than this. ""our companies have created it, expanded it, perfected it."" Over the past few years, it's true that EU regulators have attempted to crack down on what they perceive as the unfettered power of American companies in Europe. The targets for these officials haven't just been limited to commercial power and have included issues such as tax avoidance and privacy rights — including the so-called right to be forgotten which gives EU citizens the right to petition Google to remove links from certain search results. Obama's comments on Europe start at 17 minutes in. In response to questions concerning Silicon Valley's intrusion into people's personal data, Obama singled out Germany as a country that was ""very sensitive to these issues."" The president suggested that this was due to the country's ""history with the Stasi"" — the communist secret police that terrorized East Germany following World War II. Germany's chancellor Angela Merkel has previously compared the NSA to the Stasi. A spokesperson for the European Commission called Obama’s comments ""out of line,"" saying that ""regulation should make it easier for non-EU companies to access the single market,"" according to a report in the Financial Times. The unnamed official said that ""it is in [US companies’] interest that things are enforced in a uniform manner."" (The ""single market"" mentioned here is an ongoing plan to boost the EU’s faltering economy with initiatives promoting the digital industry.) Last year, the European Parliament voted in favor of breaking up Google There's undoubtedly a desire in Europe to curb the commercial power of US companies. Last year, the European Parliament voted in favor of breaking up Google to ensure ""competitive conditions,"" while other firms that are leveraging technology to beat established industries have faced a backlash. Uber, for example, triggered protests across the continent last year with taxi drivers arguing that the company was taking advantage of legislative loopholes to avoid costly regulations. What Obama failed to mention, however, is that both European and US companies have taken advantage of the EU's readiness to regulate internet firms. In 2007 Norway-based Opera filed antitrust complaints against Microsoft, with Google later tipping off EU investigators in a follow-up case that was concluded in 2013. In the same year, Microsoft and Oracle banded together with a number of companies from both Europe and the US to launch ""Fairsearch"" — a body that lobbied extensively against Google's dominance. The complaints still continue, with a Portuguese app store named Aptoide filing antitrust claims against Google in July last year. On Twitter, some individuals also took offense at Obama's comments for his perceived arrogance. Martha Lane Fox, an internet entrepreneur and member of the UK House of Lords, called Obama's comments ""bad bad bad"" before noting that the ""invention of the internet [was the responsibility of] no one country.""  .@BarackObama STOP.

The goal of these new rules is to open up the skies to any company with a qualified operator that is willing to follow some basic guidelines. Nothing will become official until a period of public comment has passed, but the industry is hailing the FAA's approach as a sensible update that would allow the industry to finally move forward with everyday use of drones. Here are the five big takeaways from yesterday's news. The FAA estimates that with these new rules in place, more than 7,000 companies would be able to begin flying drones in the first three years. Expect to see quadcopters over construction sites, inspecting cell towers, and checking for forest fires. Under the current proposal, drones would not be allowed to operate beyond the pilot's line of sight. Amazon responded that it would push to have this rule changed as it pursues Prime Air. The White House released a presidential directive requiring federal agencies to disclose when and where they fly. Tax payer-funded drones will also have to reveal what they do with any data collected during aerial surveillance. Anyone operating a drone for a private company will need to pass an ""aeronautical knowledge"" test and obtain a FAA certification that will be renewed every two years. Like R-rated films, you must be 17 or older to enjoy. But the requirements will be far less arduous than obtaining a pilot's license for flying an airplane. The FAA hopes to keep regulating small consumer drones under an exemption for model aircraft. That means no licensing, training, or identification required. We would have suggested some basic training as a reasonable threshold.

Instead of relying on American tech, the country wants to support ""independent"" mobile operating systems like the Sailfish OS, or Tizen. Last week, government officials met with leading figures in Russia's IT industry and representatives of Jolla — the company that designs Sailfish — to discuss how to crack Apple and Google's duopoly. Between them, the two companies account for around 90 percent of Russia's smartphone sales, but according to news site RBC, the country's government wants to reduce this figure to just 50 percent by the year 2025. ""It’s necessary to develop alternatives to closed or closing mobile platforms."" ""We think it’s necessary to develop alternatives to closed or closing mobile platforms based on open operating systems,"" said Russia's Minister of Telecom and Mass Communications Nikolay Nikiforov in statement, adding that he also wished to involve Russia's fellow BRICS nations — Brazil, India, China, and South Africa. ""They all worry about the existing monopoly on global software market and support us in this sphere."" However, contrary to various reports, Jolla chairman Antti Saarnio tells The Verge that Russia is not building its own mobile operating system. Instead, the country is going to be using a number of different methods to try and break its reliance on Android and iOS. One of these methods, according to a translated tweet from Nikiforov in February, will be to give grants to developers who port their apps to the Linux-based Tizen and Sailfish operating systems. Jolla also says that Russia also wants a ""localized"" version of Sailfish, where Russian services take the place of American ones. ""It doesn't make any sense to have a national operating system."" ""We are licensing our code line to vendors, and we are integrating local leading services,"" says Saarnio. ""We’ve already been shipping our devices with [Russia's leading search engine] Yandex's app store. And now we are integrating support for more and more Russian services into Sailfish."" He says these initiatives have the Russian government's backing and that reports that the country is building its own mobile OS simply ""don't make any sense."" He adds: ""I think there were some misstatements in the media ... It will not work and it’s not needed."" Even ""open source"" software comes with licenses and limitations Certainly, it seems that building a mobile operating system from scratch is a difficult, costly, and perhaps even futile endeavor in today's market. The launch of Samsung-backed Tizen OS was originally slated for 2012, for example, but various development problems delayed the software's launch. In a review of the first ever Tizen device — the low-end, $92 Samsung Z1 — Ars Technica dismissed the OS as a ""bad Android clone"" that's ""no match for the real thing."" As well as mentioning weak points like a dodgy UI and a lack of apps (around 1,000 compared to the million-plus on both Android and iOS), Ars notes that the OS is not as open source as it might appear. For example, users need a Samsung Account to sync texts and data — just as Android requires a Google account. Similarly, Jolla's Sailfish OS is based on a mixture of closed and open source licenses. Russian officials may criticize tightly controlled software like Apple's iOS, but it's wrong to suggest there are always clear lines that divide ""closed"" and ""open"" platforms. When figures such as Nikiforov praise platforms like Sailfish and Tizen for being ""independent,"" the implications seem to be more about geopolitics than software development. Following the Snowden revelations in 2013, for example, Nikiforov demanded that Apple hand over its source code to Russia so it could be searched for ""undeclared capabilities."" Saario says that Jolla is not considering the political implications of the move. ""I’m an entrepreneur and I have one mission: to maximize the user base for our operating system,"" he says. ""And from the point of view of a small technology startup we need great help, so of course, I very much welcome any help from any big country."" He adds that he's ""not worried at all"" about Russia's possible influence over Sailfish. ""All the critical know-how is what we have in our people and that's not easily transferred.""",0.6205618138883852,0.37943818611161484,0.5298591433702016,727,5.1114167812929852,409,6.0660146699266502,0,0,"Apple, Google, Mobile, Tech, US & World, Report"

The App Store was new, and game developers were still trying out strange and inventive ideas for touchscreen gaming, without having to worry about payment models or an over-flooded market. One of the best of that early wave of games was Spider: The Secret of Bryce Manor, where you played as a tiny spider, spinning webs to eat bugs while also exploring a sprawling house filled with secrets. It was an entirely unique combination of gameplay and environmental storytelling. Now, six years later, an eternity for mobile gaming, a sequel arrives: Spider: Rite of the Shrouded Moon, available today on iOS and Steam.  “In a way that first game was like a micro-expression of the idea,” says David Kalina, from developer Tiger Style Games. “And so this was an opportunity for us to revisit, and go a lot deeper to explore the mechanics and the universe and the atmosphere in a much richer fashion.” Just like the original, Shrouded Moon puts you in the role of a tiny spider in a huge house. You explore one room at a time, and the core gameplay revolves around spinning webs to catch bugs. Eat enough bugs, and an exit will open letting you move on to the next stage, and you can earn high scores by eating bugs quickly and making better webs. The game manages to stay fresh with different types of insects and room layouts. At first glance, the Spider games look like fun, casual diversions not entirely unlike the glut of mobile games out there, but there’s more lurking beneath the surface. One of my favorite things about the original game was its sense of mystery. There’s a story that unfolds, but it’s not told directly through cut scenes or dialogue. Instead, you piece it together yourself through careful observation. You may find a hidden drawer in a dresser, or stumble across a scene that tells its own tale: like a pile of bloodied, broken glass in a sink, or scattered toys abandoned in a farm. Exploring someone else’s house can be incredibly intimate, and when you’re the size of a spider, secrets you normally wouldn’t see become towering set pieces. This was a relatively small part of the original game. It helped create a cool vibe, but unless you were really looking for it, you probably missed much of the story. But in Rite of the Shrouded Moon the narrative elements are much more pronounced. Finding clues and piecing them together will help you unlock new areas to explore, and the house itself just feels denser and more real, so you’ll regularly stumble across mysteries without even trying. As you play, you’ll uncover details of a secret society, but the mystery never interferes with the actual game: you don’t have to stop to read some text to learn what’s happening. You can play like a tiny detective, piecing together clues as you go. Or, you can just pass some time on the commute. For Tiger Style’s Randy Smith, sticking with this kind of non-intrusive, environmental storytelling technique was a no-brainer. ""If you’re someone who really likes playing detective in Spider, you can stop and examine all the clues carefully and take notes, but you don’t have to,"" he explains. ""I think you get a sense of ownership that’s stronger, because instead of the story forcing itself down your throat, you have to go pull it out of the environment. It’s your responsibility."" The other big change in the sequel is the new time effects: the levels will actually change depending on the real-world time of day and weather. If you play during a rainstorm, for example, certain areas might be inaccessible because a pool of water is blocking the way. At night, different kinds of insects come out. The changes are big enough that some clues can only be found at a certain time of day or during certain weather (you have the option to change the time / weather in-game, but the feature can only be used so often). ""It was a pretty natural fit,"" Smith says of the addition, ""because weather and time make a big difference to the life of a spider. Even a tiny drop of rain is very important to a tiny spider."" Overall the sequel feels like a larger, more refined version of the original, yet it’s still incredibly unique. Over the course of the last six years, there still isn’t anything quite like Spider. It’s also more than a mobile game this time around: in addition to iOS, a PC version of Shrouded Moon is also available on Steam today, while PS4, Vita, and Android versions are coming later on. ""This game is intended for a broad audience,"" says Kalina, ""so we want to play as many cards as we can and get the game in front of as many people as possible."" That’s also the reason it isn’t called Spider 2; it’s a game you can play whether or not you experienced the original. Shrouded Moon may be a sequel, but Tiger Style is a studio dedicated to creating new ways to play and tell stories in games. In between the two Spider games, the studio released Waking Mars, a non-violent action game where you revitalize an alien world by doing what is essentially sci-fi gardening. It’s a safe bet that what the team does next will be a similarly offbeat departure — though they have no idea what that might look like just yet. ""It’s hard for us to guess what we’re going to do next,"" says Smith.

That's what Star Wars: Battlefront promises with its newly announced Fighter Squadron multiplayer mode, and for the most part, it duly delivers. The question that lingers for me, though, is whether such 10 versus 10 dogfights actually make for a truly enjoyable gaming experience. I tried the thing here at Gamescom in Cologne and the answer still eludes me.  It's very realistic, but is it fun? To keep gameplay perfectly balanced, the game's makers have made the X-Wings and TIE fighters functionally identical. You have the same weapons, the same elusiveness, and the same durability whichever side you're fighting on. You're also equally disoriented in both cockpits. The controls aren't the most intuitive to grasp and it takes a bit of trial and error to figure out the proper relationship between the left stick, which controls your aircraft's speed, and the right, which steers you around. Beyond the game's basic mechanics, you also have to adapt to being in a vehicle with momentum — this makes it difficult to stay constantly locked on to one target, and the targets themselves fly by at great speed.  It's worth acknowledging the big ""Alpha"" label in the top-right corner of the screen, designating this as still a very early iteration in the development of the final Battlefront game. That being said, I didn't spot any bugs or aberrant behavior during my two rounds of Fighter Squadron with a group of fellow Gamescom attendees. It's just not a terribly accessible mode and it takes some refinement and adaptation before you're able to do anything more than stumbling around until a more skilled player picks you off. The Millennium Falcon is a special guest superstar in this mode, though in order to get to fly it, you have to collect a special token during the match. These are positioned very close to the ground, and my best effort at swooping down to grab one resulted in an unfortunate, ignoble crash. Guess I'll just need to keep practicing. The EA reps who've flown the Falcon around tell me that it feels like being in a ""tank in the sky,"" which would make a nice upgrade from the flimsy X-Wings I was in.

For a game with such visual charm and flair, Cuphead is an absolute tyrant in its gameplay. It has a minimal tutorial section to teach you the basics of what each button does and then throws you to the wolves. And the mad carrots, and the peeved potatoes, and the birds carrying houses on their backs. Cuphead is basically a collection of really intense, exasperatingly difficult boss fights. There's usually some oversized caricature in the right or center of the screen, and there's you trying frantically to not die. You will fail many times over. Bosses spout and spew colorful volleys of deaths your way, and only the deftest and quickest of hands will be enough to overcome their barrages. In my time with the game, I quickly began to question my intelligence along with my sanity as I repeatedly faceplanted against the ""YOU DIED"" screen. The former because, come on, the game's so simple that anyone can play it: you just shoot things and avoid things shooting at you. The latter because I didn't quit and walk off to play something easier. There's something profoundly addictive about repeated failure punctuated by little moments of success. Victories in this game are hard earned, which makes them so much more satisfying I guess Cuphead's insane difficulty is in keeping with the exaggerated, frozen smile on its main character. This game is drenched in madness, and its (flimsy) narrative premise is that the player has lost a bet with the devil and is having to repay it by doing battle with a collection of angry enemies that are roughly 10 times larger and nowhere near as cute. The one disappointment I feel about this game is that it's going to put off many of the people that it should be attracting to gaming. It has a beautiful, outlandish aesthetic that draws in non-gamers. It piques interest and curiosity among people who'd be utterly unenthused about the latest installment= in the Call of Duty series. You don't need to be a Star Wars geek or a fan of dragon-slaying fantasies to get the appeal of Cuphead, you pretty much just need eyes. But to enjoy this game in its present form, you also need a steely disposition and probably a friend to help you through it. Cuphead has a two-player mode and it feels like it was designed to be played primarily that way. Even if your ally isn't terribly skilled at button mashing, his or her presence on the screen will at least absorb some of the flak coming in from enemies and keep you alive that little bit longer. Long enough to deliver that winning blow, perhaps.

Dragon Ball Z is one of the single most beloved anime properties in America. After getting a slow start in syndication back in 1996, the series — starring kind-hearted warrior Son Goku — exploded into the mainstream after launching on Cartoon Network’s Toonami block in 1998. In the 16 years since, fans have seen veritable boatloads of toys, merchandise, and video games inspired by the show, along with a fandom so massive as to produce funny, abridged retellings of the series along with whole sequel efforts long after the original creator moved on. Purists might have strong opinions about whether or not it’s the best anime ever, but for many it was the very first they ever watched, opening the door to an entire art form. Part of the show’s success is undoubtedly the voice acting. That’s a fairly unique trait; American dubs for Japanese animation have a long history of being less than stellar. However, since the dub is so foundational for fans, the voice acting talent have managed to leave their mark on the characters they play. Sean Schemmel and Christopher Sabat have played the series’ hero Goku and nemesis-turned-ally Vegeta, respectively, since 1996 — on the show, in movies, and in video games — and for many fans, their voices are now inseparable from the DBZ experience. Casual fans might not know their names, but mention the Kamehameha or Final Flash, and they’d know the voices firing those attacks in an instant. The Dragon Ball Z saga continues to this day, with the feature-length Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection ‘F’ currently in theaters. And with new series Dragon Ball Super currently airing in Japan, it won’t be long before a new dub arrives in the States. I sat down with Schemmel and Sabat this week to talk about their work as voice actors and how the show has impacted their lives. Kwame Opam: So, for a lot of fans in the States, Dragon Ball Z was the first anime that they ever watched. With the new series coming up and now the movie, are you shocked at how much longevity this series has had? Christopher Sabat: None of us expected the series or for any of us to be working on the show [to continue] for so long. I mean, granted, longevity means the series is in demand. It was around a long time before we even started. But, I don't think any of us imagined that it would be for 15 years. Sean Schemmel: I didn't either. The only thing that makes it less shocking for me is that the Japanese seem to like very long series, like Naruto, Dragon Ball, Pokémon, One Piece. So for anime itself, I'm not shocked. But given my association with those series, I agree with Chris. I'm more shocked that it's popular in America. You both voice Goku and Vegeta, respectively, and a number of other characters on the show and across media. You've even developed your own fanbases. What's it like living with that? SS: It's exactly like [being] A-listers, watered down by 1000 percent, where you have like one stalker, or maybe sometimes they'll meet you at the airport and then you have some drama, and then one-thousandth of the money. So it's exactly the same, just watered way down. CC: And you only get recognized at GameStop and grocery stores. SS: And the Los Angeles DMV, which I was recognized at when I moved to LA. I was there going to get my girlfriend her license, and some kid walks up to me, while I'm in line and goes, ""Hey, are you that guy who plays Goku?"" I get recognized like one-thousandth of the time. Do you guys ever step into character in everyday life? SS: Well, I've been playing the character for so long that the line between when I feel like Goku and me is really blurred, and sometimes I forget that I actually play this character until someone does something very polite like ""I love your work"" or recognizes me. I've been doing it for so long. Really, it's not that I don't say, ""Time to be Goku"", but I don't really feel any different. It's kind of disconcerting to me, and I think I should just see a psychiatrist. CS: I don't. I'd say Sean has a different relationship with the character than I do, because I've been at times very close to them, but the characters are so incredibly mean and ruthless all the time, and that's not necessarily my personality. However, I think the people who see me after a recording session for the show believe that I channel the characters. You're screaming in a booth for six, seven, eight hours in a row, you become kind of, well, for lack of a word, an asshole and you're exhausted and you're very short with people. In that respect that's the only way I channel the character. Could you paint a picture of what a normal day is like for you guys? SS: Well, back in the day, when we first started on Dragon Ball Z, there were Cartoon Network production crunches, and I was living in New York and would have to come back [to Los Angeles] to catch up. I would literally work a dozen 12-hour days in a row with about two one-hour breaks in between. And that was the worst! And now it works out to 12 hours out of 12 days. I don't have a problem with the hours. It keeps it moving forward, and it gets a lot done. Actually, when I pull a four-hour shift, I'm like, ""That's a little short to me"", so I need about two hours to warm up. CS: My life is different from Sean's. Sean is strictly busy working on a ton of things. A lot of things, not just Dragon Ball. And I always keep myself kind of busy too, but the work that I do as the voice director for the show involves making sure all of these very talented people can get to the studio and work more than two out of 12 hours. So, most of my job is getting the scripts ready, getting everything prepped, working with Justin [Cook, Funimation ADR director] to make sure that we're on schedule. It can be a really exhausting process. Whereas you're seeing these videos on the extra features of certain Disney movies where it just looks like all the actors are in a room, and Michael J. Fox and John Belushi and a bunch of other people filming things right now are sitting in their rooms having the most fun they've ever had, we're strictly cramped in a relatively small room by comparison, screaming for hours and hours. Whereas cartoons like The Simpsons and South Park are what’s called pre-lay shows where they all sit in one room and voice it, because of the timing nature of dubbing a show that's already in Japanese into English, it's a very slow process and it's a grueling process. You go line by line, character by character, so most actors will only ever work with me, the director. They won't actually work with any of the other actors while they're performing. They may hear them in their ear, but they won't actually be in the booth with them. So it can be a very solitary process. Since it's so grueling, does that keep you both from working on American animated properties? SS: It does, and actually that is one of the things that people find in contracts regarding overall stress. They’ll warn you before a job that this work is stressful, because they know they may be taking you away [from other opportunities]. If I work on Dragon Ball Z Monday through Wednesday, forget it! I'm not working on another show. And that can be a problem for other shows you want to work on, or being able to be a viable voice actor. CS: Sean lives in Los Angeles now, so he has access to a lot of different types of shows that we don't have access to in Dallas, per se. But in Dallas, there's actually an extremely strong anime market. Funimation has the largest selection of anime out there, so we're constantly dubbing a lot of shows. So if you live in Dallas and you're a voice actor, as long as it's not a show that you're screaming all the time, you can actually work every single day. There are certain days, like working 40-50 hours a week just doing voice work on anime alone. So it's definitely a different market in Dallas. Dubbing is hard, but it's also kind of polarizing as far as the fandom is concerned. Like a lot of people like the voice acting, but a lot of people prefer subbing. How do you navigate that? Is it really just the fact that you can't please everyone? SS: Everyone loves our voice acting! [Laughs.] CS: I think we're lucky in Dragon Ball Z in that most people prefer the dub of Dragon Ball Z over the subtitled version. Most people grew up not even knowing there was a subtitled version of Dragon Ball Z. So it’s a totally different ball game completely with Dragon Ball. What about industry wide? CS: I was actually shocked to find out the other day, because I was looking up my anime voice actor's profile, that I've had 600-something roles in anime. It's been a lot. Thing is we are so busy working on it, and we’re usually so ahead of the releases, that a lot of time we don’t hear about the fan reaction to it. And most of the time when we do, it’s at a convention, and when people love what you're doing. I think what dubbing anime does is allow people who love Japanese animation to have two different options of what they like. It’s exactly like when I buy a movie from overseas and I'm watching a feature in another language. I'm going to watch the subtitled version. The thing about anime, though, is you keep the mouth movements, which is pretty much like localizing in any language, which leads you to enjoy both ways. It’s very unique that anime has a lot of love for the voice actors for what’s essentially just an English audio option on a DVD.",0.6081299658157082,0.3918700341842918,0.1633447295973852,1747,4.4693760732684602,714,5.8081232492997197,0,1,"Culture, Entertainment, Film, Interview"

Huawei's Force Touch feature, like Apple's, differentiates the pressure users apply to the phone's touchscreen, allowing them to execute various functions, such as zooming in on a photo or opening applications. It also allows the screen to be used as a scale.

Sound seems to be a secondary consideration — even though recent Beats products like the Solo 2 Wireless headphones have made big strides in audio quality. But rivals are still eager to chip away at Beats' mindshare. Today, Bose is announcing the SoundLink II Around-Ear Wireless Headphones II. Yes, the name is incredibly clunky, and these headphones definitely don't come cheap; they're priced at $279 and slot in above the $249 SoundLink on-ear headphones we're pretty fond of. But after using them for a couple weeks, I'm pretty compelled to say that these Bluetooth headphones are worth the cost — if you've got the disposable income.  Like Beats, Bose isn't necessarily a company known for putting out audiophile-grade headphones. The company is widely renowned for its noise cancellation technology, and products like the QuietComfort line have become a lifeline for frequent travelers — especially flyers. But even if audio ""experts"" balk at Bose's name, their products are generally well received among consumers. Just take a peek at Amazon, and you'll find plenty of 4.5-star review averages to back that up. To most people, they sound just fine.  But before getting into everything I like about the Bose SoundLink IIs, it's worth noting that audio performance isn't at the top of that list. Don't get me wrong; these don't sound bad by any definition. They're well balanced without bass or the upper end overwhelming your music, but it all sounds a bit... flat. Another Verge editor described the listening experience as ""sterile."" Some people will almost certainly prefer that over a sound profile that's unfaithful to the original recordings. But for me, the pair of Beats Solo 2 Wireless headphones that I own just seem to put out a bit more life in their sound. And yet I still could rarely bring myself to take off the SoundLink IIs. (I also regularly switch between V-Moda M100s and Grado's SR325Es, if you're trying to judge my headphone cred.) They're probably the lightest and most comfortable headphones I've worn. And that's without feeling cheap. Bose uses plastic resins on the outside, but the SoundLink II wireless headphones also contain stainless steel components. The ear pads are very cushy and create a nice seal. Even without active noise cancellation, the SoundLink IIs offer impressive noise isolation. You'll know they're there, but just barely — and I never got fatigued or uncomfortable through hours using them. My only real complaint is that while they fold flat, the headphones don't fold in like my Beats (and countless others) do. The headphones play your music over Bluetooth when in wireless mode (you can attach a cable if the battery dies) and can pair over NFC with Android phones. It took a bit of doing to find the sweet spot on my Galaxy Note 5, but once I did, setup was finished within seconds. You'll hear voice prompts when pairing with or connecting to your devices. And the SoundLink Around-Ear Wireless Headphones II can conveniently connect to two playback devices simultaneously. Bose calls this multi-point, and although it's not unique to these headphones, it's a feature that plenty of competitors lack. Each time I turned them on, I'd hear a message confirming they were ready for music from both my MacBook Pro and Note 5 with no need to disconnect one device in favor of the other. The headphones can store up to eight playback devices in memory. Playback controls are found on the right earcup, and it's also here where you'll answer calls coming into your smartphone. The SoundLink IIs include a built-in mic with an adaptive voice system that automatically adjusts volume levels based on how loudly you're speaking and what sort of surrounding conditions you're in. It sounds a bit gimmicky, but I never got any complains about quality during the few calls I took while wearing them. Bose promises 15 hours of battery life, and while I haven't yet put them through a full, continuous drain, they've been lasting just as long if not longer than my wireless Beats, which is to say it's a factor you'll rarely worry about. You'll probably only have to charge them once per week with normal listening habits, and Bose says a 15-minute top-off will get you two hours of play time in a pinch. The SoundLink IIs alert you of current battery status each time you turn them on. This isn't a full review of Bose's latest consumer-aimed headphones, but it is a hearty recommendation if you're shopping in the $300 neighborhood. Can you do better if concentrating purely on the sound experience? Almost certainly. If you're used to booming bass, the audio performance here may fall a bit flat — but Bose says it designed the SoundLink IIs to be accurate above all else. The other pluses like unrivaled comfort, simultaneous Bluetooth support with two devices, and strong battery life make this a pretty compelling package. We'd probably steer clear of the white one, and even the black model looks a bit '90s in terms of styling aesthetic, but if you're buying for fashion, you're probably not looking at Bose anyway. As all-around, everyday headphones for your smartphone, they do a fine job. And for $279, they'd better accomplish that. If you're not immediately put off by the brand, you can preorder the SoundLink Around-Ear Wireless Headphones II starting today. If nothing else, give them a glance before choosing Beats by default.",0.6538466688154007,0.34615333118459934,0.16680350301664745,948,4.9588607594936711,515,5.8601941747572814,0,22,"Home, Tech, Hands-on, Photo Essay"

All will boast 4K resolutions while a few will support HDR. Just don’t buy one. Not yet. First of all, you’re unlikely to benefit from that 4K boost in resolution unless you’re sitting very close to the TV. How close? Bring on the Carlton Bale chart! As you can see from the oft-cited image above, you’ll have to sit about 3 feet or closer from your 55-inch 4K TV to notice any improvement over 1080p. And 4K content is still very limited. Buying a 4K monitor to prop in front of your keyboard and Wacom is a no-brainer if you can afford it, but buying a big 4K TV is just dumb for the average 10 foot living room. There is, however, one very good reason to eventually buy a 4K TV: HDR. High Dynamic Range is the same technology you already use on your smartphone to restore clouds in photos with otherwise blown-out skies. Now it’s coming to televisions, but only at the very top end (you won’t find it on Vizio’s $850 55-inch 4K set, for example.) HDR is legitimately desirable television tech. It’s brighter, more colorful, and offers more realistic contrast than anything you’ve seen before. You’ll definitely want it. Trouble is, if you buy one of those HDR-ready Sonys already on sale today for $4,000 (and up) you won’t able to find any HDR video to feed it. Amazon began streaming a single title in HDR back in June with Netflix scheduled to offer its own limited selections any day now. Ultra HD Blu-ray media and the HDR players that support it should arrive before the year is done. As a result, HDR titles will be extremely limited for many, many months if not years. Today at IFA, the American chipmaker is unfurling the full breadth of its Skylake range, which will span the broadest spectrum of devices in the company’s history. Intel will have Skylake processors going from a 4.5W TDP designed for ultrathin, fanless machines all the way up to 91W for workstation and enthusiast gaming purposes. Lenovo calls its new ideapad Miix 700 ""recognizably different"" with a ""progressive design,"" but it's hard to see it as anything but a Microsoft Surface clone. Designed with Windows 10 in mind, the Miix 700 is a 12-inch tablet with an adjustable kickstand at the rear. That all sounds similar to Microsoft's Surface Pro 3, and if you look at the Miix 700 then you'll see the similarities aren't minor. Building your own computer is starting to come back in style thanks to initiatives like Phonebloks and Google's Project Ara, and now Acer is bringing that idea to the desktop. It's introducing a new PC today called the Revo Build Series, which starts as a small core block and can then be built upon by adding new bricks on top of it. Imagine having a vertical tower of Lego pieces, only with every piece you add, the tower gains a new ability. Some ""unflattering moments for the NFL"" were deleted or altered, according to an email sent last August, and one of Sony's top lawyers took ""most of the bite"" out of the movie ""for legal reasons with the NFL.""

Eleven new brands have signed up to be a part of the Dash button program, bringing the total count to 29. That means there are 500 different products that are able to be ordered and reordered, through a quick tap on a button, Amazon says. New brands include Hefty, Mrs. Meyer's, Dixie, Depend, and Ice Breakers. In case you haven't been following Amazon's latest attempt to create a world of interface-free shopping: the Dash buttons are small plastic dongles that you pair (acoustically!) with the Amazon app on your iPhone or Android device, and set up to order specific things like Gatorade, Clorox Bleach Wipes, and Huggies Diapers. They were first announced in the spring, along with the Dash Replenishment Service, which allows appliance makers to build Amazon services directly into, say, a dishwasher. I gave the Dash buttons a test run last month, and, after initially thinking it might be some sort of gimmick, found the buttons to be convenient and...strangely fun. (I still haven't reordered anything through them.) But I did find it sort of ridiculous that the buttons cost $4.99 a piece, meaning that consumers have to buy things to buy more things on Amazon.com. Maybe I wasn't alone in that; Amazon is now offering a rebate for the buttons, applying $4.99 to your account per button and putting it toward your first purchase made with a lazy click. You also can't just buy whatever you want — Amazon only offers Dash buttons from select companies it's partnered with. The actual economics of the program are shrouded in mystery as is the Amazon way. Consumer goods companies were reportedly paying up to $100,000 to be a part of the beta program; Amazon wouldn't comment on its relationships with brands. Peter Larsen, Amazon's vice president of devices, did say that that the company gives consideration to consumer products that have a variable rate of usage when it's determining what will work with Dash buttons. In other words: it's the kind of stuff that you probably reorder from Amazon on an inconsistent basis, not items you'd add to your 'Subscribe & Save' list. Larsen also insisted that Dash buttons aren't a part of the company's plans to curtail some of its long-in-the-works consumer devices. Maybe what's more interesting is Amazon's vision beyond the buttons. When I asked Larsen what the next phase is in ultra-convenient shopping, he offered a scenario that indicated Amazon has grander plans to be a part of the connected home. ""You can see a scenario where, at 4 o'clock this afternoon, a lightbulb arrives at my door and I say, 'Why is this here?' And 30 minutes later our lightbulb goes out,"" Larsen said.

But Facebook's News Feed algorithm is one of the most obvious and close-cutting; a company is, however benevolently, indirectly choosing whose opinions you get to see. In a study published in Science, however, Facebook argues that it's not your feed that's primarily stopping you from reading opposing viewpoints — it's you. ""People's individual choices ... matter more than any kind of algorithmic choice."" ""People's individual choices about who to interact with and what to select matter more than any kind of algorithmic choice,"" says researcher Eytan Bakshy. Bakshy and his two co-authors are part of Facebook's data science team (one, Lada Adamic, is also an associate professor at the University of Michigan). In their latest research, they used data from millions of Facebook users to look at what determines whether someone sees, clicks, or shares a piece of news that might not mesh with their political ideas. Bakshy and his team started with aggregated, anonymous statistics from 10.1 million US Facebook users whose profiles listed a political stance. From there, they examined links that were classified as ""hard news"" (as opposed to entertainment or sports) and sorted them based on political alignment — whether the link had been shared more by people who identified themselves as liberal or conservative. Then, they checked on how frequently those links appeared at various points in the viewing process. Were people's friends sharing ideologically opposing content? Were users actually seeing it? And if they were seeing it, were they clicking? This work follows up on an earlier finding that while you might interact mostly with a few close friends, the ""vast majority"" of information comes from weaker ties. At the time, Bakshy said this suggested that ""Facebook isn’t the echo chamber that some might expect,"" since these weak ties were often from different communities — just think of what you see from your relatives and high school friends. But Facebook's News Feed algorithm prioritizes the strong ties, showing you more from people whose posts you've liked, commented on, or shared (among other things) in the past. In theory, this could trap users in an echo chamber full of people they already agree with. A small number of opposing viewpoints do get shut out of the News Feed Bakshy says roughly equal numbers of people identify as liberal and conservative on Facebook, but their networks aren't equally liberal and conservative; for users who report their affiliation, an average of 23 percent of friends identify with the opposite side. Conservatives are slightly more likely to share content overall, but overall, the study found that around a quarter of the news shared by liberals' friends was aligned with conservatives, and a third of conservatives' friends' content was liberal. ""Liberals tend to have less opportunities to be exposed to content shared from conservatives because they tend to be less connected to individuals who share primarily from conservative sources,"" says Bakshy. The test here is whether those shared links actually showed up in users' news feeds — or if Facebook has, in fact, edited them out. As it turns out, Facebook does edit out a portion of them. According to the data, if you're a liberal, a conservative article is 8 percent less likely to make it into your news feed than a liberal one. If you're conservative, you're 5 percent less likely to see liberal news. In absolute terms, both liberals and conservatives see about 1 percent less news from the opposing side than they would if Facebook didn't tweak the news feed.   The proportion of opposing links that liberals and conservatives would see if sharing were completely random, compared to what their friends post and what they see or click. This research, however, found that the drop is bigger between what people see and what they click on. About 23 percent of what liberals' friends share is conservative. Twenty-two percent of what they see in the News Feed is, and the pieces they actually click on are 20 percent conservative. For conservatives, their friends share 34 percent liberal content, they see 33 percent, and they click on 29 percent. (Respectively, that's 6 percent and 17 percent less likely to click than see.) Based on these numbers, the echo chamber we select for is ultimately bigger than the one Facebook picks for us, whether that's because we know fewer people from the other side of the aisle or because we pay less attention to what they share. Pariser has published his own response to the study on Medium, where he calls the effect of the algorithm ""not insignificant,"" particularly noting that the algorithm is only slightly less important than clickthrough rates for liberals. And he says that the ""filter bubble"" also manifests in what kind of content people share. ""Only 7 percent of the content folks click on on Facebook is 'hard news,'"" he says. ""That’s a distressingly small piece of the puzzle. And it suggests that 'soft' news may be winning the war for attention on social media  —  at least for now."" Since this study only measured people who felt strongly enough to list a political orientation — a number Bakshy puts at 9 percent — it's possible they're not representative of Facebook users at large. ""What we do know is that moderates are quite similar to individuals who do not self-report, and that moderates look just like conservatives and liberals on their behavior on Facebook,"" says Bakshy. ""But it is an interesting question to consider."" ""Both liberals and conservatives have the potential to be exposed to content from the other side."" There are also subtleties that Facebook's automated analysis can't see. It can't tell, for example, if you're reading the summary and headline of an article but not clicking through. And since political alignment is based on general averages, it's not a measure of ""spin"" or even slant. ""It's possible that we're classifying things as liberal when it actually doesn't contain any kind of slant or bias,"" for example, says Bakshy, because it comes from a source that's primarily read by liberals. ""Some of the Huffington Post's articles are fairly neutral, but some are fairly polarized."" Eventually, he'd like to look more deeply at single issues like gun laws or reproductive rights. But he's also optimistic that even if politics are polarized, the echo chamber isn't impenetrable. ""Both liberals and conservatives have the potential to be exposed to content from the other side and do in fact click on content from the other side,"" he says. Facebook isn't a good proxy for the larger ""filter bubble"" or even other social networks. It's often based around multiple circles of friends who know each other through completely separate offline interests, while people may join a network like Twitter specifically to talk to people they don't know. It's also hard to tell how this compares to the offline world. Is the internet helping people share news they might not in a face-to-face conversation? Or is it letting us curate our experiences to fit our own opinions? Although this is far beyond Facebook's scope, Bakshy thinks Facebook might help us start to study it. ""This is the first time we've really been able to measure how much people could be and are exposed to information from the other side,"" he says. ""There's been no way to measure this in the offline world, and we've been able to do this for the first time in the online world at a very granular level.""

Using a technique called solar sailing, Sagan described a craft that used a large reflective sheet to ""work exactly as a sailboat does,"" harnessing radiation from the sun to travel around our solar system. Now, almost forty years later, a solar-sailing spacecraft like the one Sagan described is about to have its first test flight. The privately funded LightSail project is the creation of The Planetary Society — the non-profit group founded by Sagan and other astronomical luminaries, and currently headed by Bill Nye of ""the Science Guy"" fame — and aims to offer a demonstration of the potential of solar sailing as a faster and cheaper method of space propulsion than chemical rockets with two small spacecraft built by Stellar Exploration Inc. The first of these is tentatively scheduled to launch on May 20th.  The crafts have two main parts — four triangular Mylar sails that allow them to ride solar radiation, and small square ""CubeSat"" satellites that will open four arms to unfurl the sheeting. While solar sailing allows craft to travel toward, away from, and alongside the sun just as a sailboat can with the wind, crafts equipped with the technology still need a rocket-shaped shove to get out of our atmosphere. For its test flight, the LightSail will be riding an Atlas V rocket into the upper reaches of the atmosphere, a vehicle provided by Boeing and Lockheed Martin's joint space venture, United Launch Alliance. The final version of the craft will be ensconced inside another satellite, called Prox-1, and carried into space by SpaceX's Falcon Heavy rocket. The project's first test flight, delayed from an original launch date of May 6th, intends to prove that LightSail can successfully unfurl its Mylar sheeting. If all goes to plan, a second LightSail mission will launch in April next year, aiming to demonstrate how future spaceships could use the propulsion technique to get around in our solar system without the need for bulky boosters or vast reserves of fuel that drive up the price of projects. Indeed, LightSail-1 was built with just $1.8 million, and the entire estimated program costs only reach $4.5 million — a tiny amount when compared with other spacecraft.  LightSail won't be the first solar sail to make it into space. A Japanese mission called IKAROS achieved that accolade in 2010, and in 2011, NASA successfully deployed a solar sail in low Earth orbit as part of its NanoSail-D project. But Bill Nye — thirty years after Carl Sagan helped found The Planetary Society to get people excited in space again — still echoes his mentor's enthusiasm about the technology. Speaking about the private funding the non-profit group received from donors and members to build the LightSail-1, Nye said ""this is people who are enthusiastic about space exploration, who want to lower the cost of space exploration,"" backing a project that could help humans do ""a lot more of it.""",0.5790911554678455,0.4209088445321545,0.8630859615368832,517,4.9980657640232105,298,5.9194630872483218,0,0,"Science, Space"

The first is rapidly heading toward becoming a reality thanks to the explosive interest in the Oculus Rift, but the second is in active development. The NeuroGaming Conference and Expo that took place in San Francisco this week offered a good opportunity to see what the next frontier of gaming might look like after VR takes hold. For now, though, it’s a trend very much in its infancy. That’s not necessarily a bad thing. I arrived expecting an exhibition filled with half-baked game ideas. But the event was more focused on how games can help the mind than games you play *with* your mind. Akili Interactive, for example, built a seemingly standard iPad game that measures the differences in brain activity between a normal child and one with ADHD or autism. The company says it measures 65 different pieces of data every second through gameplay. ""We have very clear signatures that come out of the game that tell us exactly what a person’s cognitive deficits are,"" says Akili’s creative director, Matthew Omernick. A company called Qneuro showed off a game that pulls together all the concepts the NeuroGaming Expo focused on. It’s an educational game called Axon Infinity: Space Academy with a futuristic, outer space style in which you learn math skills and put them into play in missions when fighting aliens. The catch here is that if you use an EEG, the game can adapt and gets more difficult based on brain readings. The math game can still be played on an iPad, the Surface, or a standard PC with a standard controller, but it will change based on both your aptitude and brain response. More of a research convention for scientists than your average gaming conference The event was full of representatives from universities and research groups like the University of Texas’ Brain Performance Institute, the nonprofit Center for Responsible Brainwave Technologies (a group trying to regulate how brain data is collected and used by companies), the Cerebral Palsy Network Program, and a number of others. It felt more like a research convention for scientists to talk shop than any sort of gaming expo I’ve ever seen. Video games to sharpen your brain, not necessarily controlled by your brain Adam Gazzaley, director of the Neuroscape lab at UCSF, set the tone with his opening keynote. One of the main studies he discussed involved a custom video game built to increase cognitive factors (like attention span, multitasking ability, memory, and so one) in older adults. The game is a racing game called Neuroracer that’s designed to engage the multitasking portion of your brain. Results showed that 12 hours of playing the game over a month significantly increased the cognitive function of a test group of 60- to 85-year-olds compared to a control group, Gazzaley said. What struck me about the NeuroGaming event was how little ""gaming"" there was to be had. Last year, a game called Throw Trucks With Your Mind delivered exactly what it promised. Players wore an EEG reading sensor and when they slowed their thoughts and blocked out distractions, their video game avatar was able to start picking up and throwing objects at their opponents. It sounded like a fun demo, but unfortunately things don’t seem to have progressed much from that idea. There was one game called NeuroMage that used a similar ""relax the mind"" technique to help you learn spells you could then cast against an opponent, and a Star Wars tie-in from Uncle Milton’s Toys used the same relaxation technique to let you levitate a hologram of the Millennium Falcon. The Star Wars product will actually come to market this fall — it works with a tablet to project holograms and will come with a custom EEG headset from NeuroSky to measure brain activity. (There truly is nothing that Disney won’t consider as a Star Wars tie-in.) What you’ll be able to do with it beyond levitating a spaceship hasn’t been revealed yet. Still, you’d be disappointed if you were looking for the future of gaming here. Indeed, most of the gaming-related demos being shown off weren’t directly tied into neuroscience at all. There were plenty of demos using the Oculus Rift, Sony was showing off Project Morpheus, and Leap Motion was on display. The Sixense lightsaber demo we saw at CES attracted quite a crowd. With these demos, the actual connection to neuroscience seemed to be limited to the idea that motion control and VR could be integral parts of brain-based gaming — but the feeling I got was that they were just there to be part of an expo that has its roots in nontraditional gaming controls. Neurogame builders have been encouraged by the VR boom The belief I got from talking to various exhibitors was simply that mind control can be another tool that adds to the experience of gaming in a virtual world. We have the Rift for VR, Sixense or Leap Motion for tracking our movements, and companies like NeuroSky and Emotiv providing brain-sensing technology. The pieces haven’t come together yet, but there’s a hope that they will someday soon. (MindMaze, which we saw at GDC 2015 is a good example of something trying to tie all these bits together.) While your brain isn’t a sure bet to be the next radical input method for next-generation consoles, all of the tinkering and experimentation happening around neurogaming suggests it will be eventually.",0.5942572782131906,0.40574272178680937,0.2027881150826326,943,4.9469777306468714,520,6.1442307692307692,0,0,"Gaming, Science, Report"

The researchers believed the perytons were linked to atmospheric activity such as lightning strikes, and they held this belief for around 17 years, until this year, when they installed a new receiver to monitor interference, The Guardian reports. The actual source of the perytons? A microwave. The receiver detected signals at 2.4 GHz within 5 kilometers of the telescope, which the researchers realized were being created by staffers heating up their lunches in the Parkes Observatory kitchen. The interference only occurred when staffers opened the microwave door while it was still heating. Digital interference in the time it takes to heat up leftovers ""If you set it to heat and pull it open to have a look, it generates interference,"" Simon Johnston, head of astrophysics at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) told The Guardian.

When the telescope, known as The Dish, was built in 1961, Parkes was a quiet town and the observatory just outside it was largely isolated. But Johnston says digital interference has only gotten worse as time goes own. To escape the digital noise, the astronomers looked for a more secluded area in which to build a new telescope, the Australian Square Kilometer Array Pathfinder (ASKAP). Johnston said they found the ""quietest site on earth to do astronomy"" in Western Australia — a place with no Wi-Fi, no radio signals, and no mobile phone coverage.

""We need to know how to prioritize the creation and the volume procurement and delivery of these additional vaccines,"" says Gates. ""We're going to build capacity and be ready for epidemics."" Although child mortality rates have been brought down significantly in recent years (from one in 10 children dying before the age of five in 1990 to one in 20 today), Gates says that more effort is needed to push this figure lower still. The death rate for very young children, for example, has proved a particularly difficult challenge, with newborns still accounting for 44 percent of all childhood deaths. Gates says that as well helping drive down these figures, the centers will also help deal with epidemics. He notes that the slow reaction to the ongoing Ebola outbreak in West Africa was due in part to the absence of local laboratories, with aid workers having to deal with difficult logistics like transporting blood vials across borders to test for Ebola. ""We're going to build capacity and be ready for epidemics,"" Gates told The Atlantic. ""The next epidemic might be something we haven't seen before. It might be flu, which we are outrageously still not ready for a big flu outbreak.""

Births in the country are daytime affairs, reports the CDC in a new study of birth certificate data from 2013. If a child is born during the weekday, chances are, they were born during the morning and midday hours. And the reason for that is far from biological. The fact is that more babies are born during the day because that's when medical professionals schedule cesareans — a delivery method that makes up one-third of US births. One third of US babies are born by cesarean section If births were equally timed throughout the day, about 4.2 percent of babies born in a single day would be born each hour. But because the number of births that take place each day tend to happen between 8AM and 5:59PM — prime working hours for hospital staff — the percentage of births that happen each hour is much higher during that window of time. ""The highest percentages of births occurred during the 8:00AM and noon hours,"" with 6.3 and 6 percent of births, respectively, the authors of the CDC report note. Less than 3 percent of babies are born each hour between midnight and 6:59AM, however. And weekends show a more evenly distributed pattern of deliveries.   The method of delivery also has an impact. In 2013, the US saw about 3.9 million births. Of those, more than 98 percent were hospital deliveries. These can be broken down into four categories: non-induced vaginal births, induced vaginal births, unplanned cesareans, and planned cesareans. Vaginal births that aren’t initiated by drugs or surgical means, for instance, are more likely than cesareans and induced vaginal births to occur in the evening and early morning. In contrast, planned cesarean deliveries are much more concentrated during the day than unplanned cesarean deliveries. Overall, induced vaginal births rise in the morning, peak in the mid-afternoon, and then decline starting at 6PM.   Out-of-hospital deliveries are different Out-of-hospital deliveries follow a different pattern, however. They are more likely to happen in the early morning hours — a time when hospitals see the lowest percentages of births. Then, they slowly decrease until about 12PM, when there’s a short uptick in births. After that, births don’t increase again until about 3PM. The difference in timing of hospital births and out-of-hospital deliveries suggests that medical interventions — interventions that have increased in frequency over the past few decades — are playing a big role in determining the timing of children's' birth. But the study only took into account 90 percent of all US births, so it may not be representative of the entire country. That will change soon, however; time-of-birth data will be available for the entire country starting in 2016.",0.6405362902650932,0.3594637097349068,0.5410310133387857,479,5.0542797494780789,250,5.8719999999999999,0,4,

The palm-like Pandanus candelabrum apparently prefers soil rich in kimberlite — a type of igneous rock that forms in the Earth's crust in huge vertical columns. These kimberlite pipes, as they're known, reach deep into the mantle and are the result of ancient volcanic eruptions that can push diamonds (along with other material) hundreds of miles up to the Earth's surface. Although geologists have long known that where there's kimberlite, there are often diamonds, now — thanks to Pandanus candelabrum — there's an easy way of finding the kimberlite too. the kimberlite-rich soil makes a ""very good fertilizer"" The discovery of Pandanus candelabrum's expensive taste was made in Liberia by Florida International University researcher Stephen Haggerty, who published his findings in a paper in Economic Geology. Haggerty tells Science, who first reported the story, that he thinks the plant adapted to grow in the kimberlite-rich soil because it contains high levels of magnesium, potassium, and phosphorus. These combine to create what is essentially a ""very good fertilizer,"" says Haggerty. It certainly seems to make for a healthy diet, with Pandanus candelabrum growing up to 10 meters tall on an above-ground root system similar to that of mangrove trees.  An illustration of Pandanus candelabrum from a 19th century encyclopedia. (Flickr/Creative Commons) Haggerty adds that even though the plant's presence indicates that there's kimberlite in the ground, this doesn't guarantee that there'll be diamonds as well. Kimberlite pipes are rare to begin with, and of the roughly 6,000 examples known in the world, only around 600 contain diamonds. Of these, only 60 or so contain enough gems to be worth mining. Haggerty, who also works as the chief exploration officer of Youssef Diamond Mining Company, which has mining interests in Liberia, says that if researchers can learn to spot the plant via aerial survey, it could help countries in the area develop new diamond mines without having to fight their way through dense forests. Prospectors, one researcher told Science, are going to ""jump on it like crazy."" Indicator species have been used to find metals since medieval times Pandanus candelabrum's role as a diamond spotter may sound unlikely, but this sort of indicator species has been known about for centuries. For example, the small Alpine plant Lychnis alpina has distinctive pink flowers and has been used since medieval times to find sources of copper. Modern analysis has since discovered that the species is genetically resistant to the metal, allowing it to thrive in soil where the presence of copper ore keeps other plants away.",0.7371470511359532,0.26285294886404675,0.7680210430045533,453,5.2671081677704192,282,6.0957446808510642,0,2,"Science, US & World"

You can find it at theverge.com/transportation, on our home page (notice that new ""Cars"" link at the top!), and everywhere else across the internet where you’ve come to expect us. It's no April Fools' joke. In fact, it might not come as a surprise to some of you, since it’s an extension of stories we’ve already been unable to resist. Perhaps you noticed our coverage of incredible cars like the Mercedes-Benz F 015, the BMW i8, and the Tesla Model S P85D in the past, among many others. But consider this formal notice that we intend to create the most exciting and dynamic transportation coverage the world has ever seen. It’d be a terrifying undertaking if we were starting from scratch, but we’re building all of this on top of The Verge — a powerful, proven foundation that gives us the experience and the platform to make it possible. (We’ve already expanded our coverage of science and entertainment in exciting ways under the leadership of Liz Lopatto and Emily Yoshida, and we certainly didn't intend to stop there.) I know The Verge well; I know what we’re capable of. This is going to be fun, and I’d like to invite you to ride along.

The 570S still isn't exactly cheap, but at an estimated $180,000, it's set to be by far the cheapest model McLaren has ever sold. A photo posted by @dumephotos on Mar 30, 2015 at 11:49am PDT  The car was first shown off to press behind closed doors back in January. McLaren reportedly banned photos of the car at the event, but some have surfaced, showing sleek bodywork, wasp-ish headlights, and the kind of gullwing doors that make the ""budget"" supercar look like its bigger brother, the legendary McLaren F1.

Then there's the Continental: a giant box of steel and leather, a testament to big, American-style luxury. In the ’90s and aughts, the Continental sort of circled the drain, but there was a time when this Lincoln flagship was legitimately one of the most luxurious (and expensive) cars in the world. That's the backdrop for Lincoln here in the days leading up to this week's New York International Auto Show, where the Ford brand is showing an all-new Continental concept that it promises tracks very closely to the production car that will debut next year. I had a chance to see it up close. This isn't your grandfather's Lincoln — but it's also kind of your grandfather's Lincoln. Ford CEO Mark Fields says that internal concepts for a new Lincoln flagship sedan didn't really impress executives inside the company until they suggested it might be called Continental, which set the creative juices flowing — it's an iconic marque that designers were able to latch onto. In all honesty, the exterior is bland, if imposing — but that might work well with Lincoln's target market (Chinese nouveau riche, who prefer to be chauffeured). It definitely played better for me in person than in press photos, which make the car look like a generic mix of a slew of German, Korean, and Japanese large luxury sedans. The interior, though, is where the Continental really shines. The rich blue surfaces feel as sumptuous as they look: plush everything from carpet to headliner, with polished metal accents in every direction. For the maximum ""I'm being driven around in my giant car"" effect, the footrest for the right rear passenger can extend at the expense of the right front passenger's space. A desk with a built-in tablet offers entertainment, seat controls, and perhaps the occasional email. As enormous as this car is, you'd expect a V-8 — but it's actually powered by a compact 3.0-liter V-6, a Lincoln-exclusive EcoBoost twin turbo (then again, the ridiculous new Ford GT has a six-cylinder, so we need to get used to it). And engine aside, it really is a gigantic vehicle. Maybe it's not the most visually stunning car in New York this week, but I'd argue it fits the Continental name, and it fits Lincoln's ""Quiet Luxury"" mantra.

It's no coincidence that crosstown rival Lincoln debuted the giant Continental concept at this very same show — Cadillac and Lincoln are both learning that luxury marques look a little lost without a big flagship in the lineup, and the red-hot Chinese market is demanding large American sedans anyway. The time is right, if you believe GM and Ford. The CT6 will be offered with an exclusive 3-liter twin-turbo V-6 engine (like the Continental) that puts out 400 horsepower and 400 ft-lb. of torque, impressive numbers considering the displacement. There's also an enhanced version of Cue — Cadillac's infortainment system — that now includes a touchpad in the center console and the promise of faster response times.

Now, we know: it'll hit Taipei City and the greater New Taipei City region, right in Gogoro's backyard, this summer.  No pricing information yet Before that summer launch, Gogoro is opening a retail store this week in Taipei that's designed to educate potential customers on what the product is all about. That'll be particularly important here because you can't just plug the Smartscooter in — you have to subscribe to a plan that lets you swap batteries in and out of kiosks placed throughout the city as you need them. Two of the batteries, designed in partnership with Panasonic, slip into docks underneath the Smartscooter's seat. The company is also launching a pilot program that'll let 100 riders effectively ""beta test"" the scooter and its infrastructure leading up to the summer launch, intended to help iron out the kinks.  Inside Gogoro's Taipei store. Pricing hasn't been announced, but Gogoro had previously stated that it expected the Smartscooter to sell for roughly the same as a competing gas scooter because the very expensive batteries aren't included — you get them on a subscription plan in lieu of gasoline. Additionally, Taipei will be offering buyers some incentives that should lower the bill. Of course, Taipei is just a single market, and unlike other scooters, you can't just buy a Smartscooter and use it somewhere else — it needs to be used where the infrastructure to support it exists.

Its latest experiment brings those same elements together to create a sign that can have its display changed from the web, even though there's nothing electronic on the display itself. Called the Pixel Track, the sign is built around what Berg is calling ""mechanical pixels"" — basically little blocks that flip back and forth between two different colors. In one case, the sign might use black blocks to represent pixels that are ""off"" and white blocks to form letters out of the pixels that are ""on.""   ""Works a little bit like a toy railway track.""The sign is a long, thin strip just five blocks high, and multiple signs can apparently be placed side by side to form increasingly long displays. Behind the display is what Berg says is effectively a Hot Wheels track that allows a small scanner to run back and forth along it, flipping the mechanical pixels on command. Only the scanner is connected to the web, limiting how much battery it needs to run. And because the display has nothing electronic on it, it will permanently maintain its state until the scanner changes it again. Berg says this should allow the entire system to run on battery power for a long period of time. Berg only put Pixel Track together as a case study, to see if it could find a solution for displays that need to be updated occasionally — from hourly to daily — but don't need constant status changes.

It was reported earlier this month that he was very ill and would remain at home during his final weeks. Vignelli co-founded the design firm Unimark International in 1964, which specialized in corporate identities until its closure the following decade, according to AIGA. In that time, it worked with Ford, JCPenney, and IBM — among other international companies — to develop brand identities for them, several of which remained for decades afterward. The most recognizable of those is certainly American Airlines' ""AA"" logo, which is credited to Vignelli himself. It was created in 1967 and used up until the airline unveiled a much-criticized redesign last year. Vignelli was among the critics. ""There was no need to change. It’s been around for 45 years,"" he told Bloomberg BusinessWeek at the time. ""Every other airline has changed its logo many times, and every time was worse than the previous one. Fifty years ago there were very few logos in general. Somebody started to do logos and people started thinking that logos were important … It’s ridiculous. A word is so much better."" Though American Airlines' old logo featured an eagle, Vignelli made it clear that he did not design it and was not happy with its presence. Several years after working with American Airlines, Vignelli came to design one of the best-know — and most controversial — maps ever used by the New York City subway. Unveiled in 1972, the map turned New York City into a series of rigid brown and beige slabs with colorful subway lines darting across it. The map was hardly a map though, at least not one like riders expected: its lines and shapes weren't accurate recreations of the city or the subway routes. Instead, they were representations meant to make the routes and their stops easier to understand. Along with his wife Lella, Vignelli went on to found Vignelli Designs and Vignelli Associates. While they continued to work on corporate identities, the companies covered everything from interior design to packaging and furniture. Among its most recognizable works is Bloomingdale's logo as well as its ""brown bag,"" according to The New York Times. Vignelli has continued designing as part of those companies in the decades since, and in 2009 released a free ebook looking back at his and the company's work. ""Design is a profession that takes care of everything around us,"" Vignelli told Design Matters host Debbie Millman back in 2007. ""Politicians take care of the nation and fix things — at least they are supposed to. Architects take care of buildings. Designers take care of everything around us. Everything that is around us, this table, this chair, this lamp, this pen has been designed. All of these things, everything has been designed by somebody.""

Bachor's city is crippled by potholes; between January and March Chicago filled over 350,000, but estimated 60,000 still needed attention. ""The problem with fixing potholes is that it's always temporary,"" Bachor tells The Verge, ""they get filled sometimes more than once a winter. There was a stubborn pothole in front of our house and I decided to merge my artwork with this problem in the city by creating a special piece of art and installing it."" Bachor's mosaics take between two and three hours to complete, and choosing the perfect hole to fill takes far longer. He needs to find a solitary pothole away from the center of the street — traffic won't stop for an artist at work — and installs his mosaics when roads are at their quietest. Each features the flag of Chicago alongside the word ""pothole"" or a long serial number, poking fun at the scale of the problem in the city. Chicago's Department of Transportation (CDOT) has fought hard to deal with potholes, increasing its efforts to repair that city's streets and implementing a simple online service for reporting problems.

Unveiled last week, the new D&D logo is what'll be accompanying materials for the classic role-playing game's fifth edition. The logo does away with the cartoonishly medieval lettering and textures present on the prior few versions and — reflecting current trends — tidies it up into a much neater, cleaner design that still includes enough flair around the edges to get across the series' fantasy theme.  The new Dungeons & Dragons logo. The ampersand is a return to formThe most interesting aspect of the new wordmark isn't the words though: it's the ampersand between them. According to Brand New, D&D publisher Wizards of the Coast actually hired an outside design team for the creation of the ampersand alone, while its parent company, Hasbro, handled the words. The result is a clever transformation of the symbol into a looping dragon breathing out fire — a more-than-appropriate centerpiece for the game's logo. Unfortunately, Brand New reports that Hasbro took a very classic and straight design of the dragon-ampersand created by the outside team and coated it with the 3D chrome look that it's using on the final version. It's a good bit tackier that way, but you may not have to look at it everywhere: the core rulebooks for the next version of the game feature an abbreviated logo that just reads D&D, and the ampersand is present in a flattened red. The ampersand is also front-and-center, suggesting that it alone may be used as a way to identify new D&D products. Left: The final D&D ampersand. Right: The version created by designers at Glitschka Studios, according to Brand New. While the ampersand bears more than a passing resemblance to Guild Wars 2's logo, which transforms its ""2"" into a fiery dragon, D&D's new ampersand is actually a return to form for the game. It's been using dragons as ampersands for the past several editions — they've just been far more unintelligible. Go back to Advanced Dungeons and Dragons' second edition and other versions in the 1980s, however, and you'll find that the ampersand actually has a fairly similar look to what it's come back to today. An almost identical dragon-ampersand is present on the second edition of AD&D's core rulebooks, though its style feels distinctly more retro at this point. That logo also features simpler typography, though the new edition's logo still feels much more modern. D&D's logo has been changing regularly alongside notable releases of the game, and the next big one is coming up this summer. The new version attempts to blend more roleplaying elements into the (arguably overly) streamlined mechanics introduced in 4th Edition, while winning back players who have abandoned ship to other games, particularly Pathfinder. A starter kit will be released July 15th, and the core rulebooks will follow over the next four months.  Past D&D logos have featured a dragon in the ampersand. Top: AD&D. Middle: Edition 3.5.

First published late last year, the book recounts Esslinger's famous collaboration with Jobs, and it includes amazing photos of some of the many, many prototypes to come out of it.

The design will now move from prototype to manufacturing, a dangerous phase for any technology project — and while the dream is exciting, the logistics of actually pulling it off are less so. The Brusaws are not scammers or wackos. Scott has an electrical engineering background and the project has gotten two rounds of funding from the Federal Highway Administration. They’ve built a prototype parking lot made of solar panels, microprocessors, and LEDs encased in a textured glass that they say can withstand the weight of a 250,000-pound truck. They say their prototype can hold a 250,000-pound truck In theory, the idea could work: replace all the nation’s asphalt with solar panels, and we’d generate more than three times the electricity the US uses. Solar Roadways’ design would also filter stormwater, replace above-ground power cables, prevent icy roads by melting snow, and light up to warn drivers if a moose wanders onto the road. Unfortunately, the list of obstacles is long. The main problem is cost. ""Sure, we could pave the streets with solar panels, but we could also pave them with gold,"" science writer Aaron Saenz wrote in 2010, when Solar Roadways was first getting national attention. ""There is roughly 29,000 square miles of road surface to cover. We need roughly 5.6 billion panels to cover that area. That’s a price tag of $56 trillion!"" Even using the Brusaws’ rosy numbers, which Saenz says overestimate the cost of asphalt, he writes solar roads are 50 percent more expensive than traditional roads. The Indiegogo campaign does not address the cost issue, and the Brusaws are vague about what exactly the $1 million will buy. ""We need to make a few tweaks to our product and streamline our manufacturing process so that we can make our panels available to the public as quickly as possible,"" they write. Joel Anderson, a business editor for Equities.com, was one of the few in the media to throw cold water on the idea. ""The Brusaws have been unable to secure any piece of the more-than $2 billion a year spent on solar research and development around the world,"" he writes. ""Probably because there’s too many more-practical, more-promising investments to be made to seriously consider this pipe dream."" Most of the tech challenges seem solvable, but the cost issue may not be He brings up a good point. Rooftop panels and solar arrays are already established as a viable power source, but adoption is still low. It’s hard to imagine a city ripping up asphalt and installing a largely unproven technology when it could achieve the same level of power generation by planting panels along the road, which is the Oregon Solar Highway program’s approach. And while Solar Roadways has been a hit at talk series like Google’s Solve for X and TED, it lost out on $200 million in funding from GE’s Ecomagination contest and has not received an actual investment from Google.  The Brusaws and their prototype parking lot. Most of the technological challenges seem solvable. Those include things like how to keep the roads clean, how to increase the efficiency of the panels in the road, how to store the solar power, how to get electricity from more remote roads to the grid, and whether the glass is durable enough. Whether they’re solvable for a reasonable price tag is another question. The couple says they have some customers lined up as soon as the product is finished, but decline to name them or specify the strength of their commitment. They also mention the possibility of other revenue sources besides selling electricity, such as advertising on the roads’ LED displays or charging people to refuel their electric cars, but the list sounds more like brainstorming than a business plan. The idea isn’t dead on arrival, and even skeptics say they’d love to see it work. But for now, the Brusaws’ promise of a ""paradigm shift"" seems blindly optimistic.",0.39840971685559623,0.6015902831444038,0.7842117742574182,697,4.9784791965566715,398,6.0552763819095476,0,0,"Design, Report"

Choueiri also heads the school’s 3D Audio and Applied Acoustics lab, and over the last decade, he has dedicated his time to the development, application, and refinement of binaural recording systems — a century-old method of audio recording that captures lifelike 3D audio in picture-perfect fidelity.   In his warmly lit apartment, a pair of speakers loomed over me as I sank into a leather couch in the living room. Sitting in an adjacent chair, Choueiri swiped through his iPad to set up a binaural audio demonstration. Moments later, Amber Rubarth’s folksy voice filled the room as she sang an acoustic rendition of Louis Armstrong’s ""A Kiss to Build a Dream On."" The room transformed into an intimate live music venue and the soundscape was vivid: Rubarth was positioned right in front of me, with her band members on either side. A cellist on the right plucked on the strings of the instrument. A couple of soulful verses later, a violinist on the left grabbed my attention. I instinctively turned to look in that direction. If only for a few split seconds, my brain was tricked into believing the performance was actually live, and not recorded. ""It puts you in the exact sound field as originally intended,"" says Choueiri of binaural recordings. ""You can hear a bird flying over your head. You’ll hear a whisper in one ear. And if you record a band, you’ll hear it exactly as the band was positioned when playing."" For decades, binaural recording was a novelty, and overlooked for less technically demanding methods. But with the rise of virtual reality hardware like the Oculus Rift, Sony’s Morpheus, and Samsung’s Gear — systems dependent on realistic 3D audio to fully immerse their users — binaural audio is on the cusp of a renaissance. Binaural recording systems are unique because they emulate the workings of the human head. The architecture of our anatomy dictates how we understand the sounds we hear: with an ear on either side of a thick skull and spongy brain, we hear sounds enter our left and right ears at different times. If a dog barks by our left ear, it takes a few extra microseconds for the bark to reach the right ear; the sound will also be louder in one ear than the other. In addition, sound waves interact with the physical constitution of the listener — the pinna (or outer ear), the head, and the torso — and the surrounding space, creating listener-specific variations otherwise known as head-related transfer function. The brain scrutinizes these miniscule interaural differences of time and strength in order to localize sound with immaculate precision.    Traditionally, recordings have been made using two methods: mono and stereo. Mono uses a single microphone to pick up sound, while stereo uses two, spaced apart from each other. Binaural recording takes the stereo method one step further by placing two microphones in ear-like cavities on either side of a stand or dummy head. Because the dummy head recreates the density and shape of a human head, these microphones capture and process sound exactly as it would be heard by human ears, preserving interaural cues. The effect is best experienced over headphones, with a clear distinction between left and right perspectives. It’s a simple concept, but when done with high-quality microphones and played over equally high-quality headphones, the effect is eerie: it fools the brain into believing it's hearing the sounds firsthand. The illusion creates three-dimensional audio, which is not to be confused with surround sound. Interchanging those terms is the quickest way to amuse — and sometimes annoy — an acoustician. A surround sound system employs multiple speakers to create a 360-degree field around the listener. Say you’re watching a film presented in surround sound: you’ll see an explosion on one side of the screen, and a speaker on the corresponding side of the theater will emit a barrage of sounds. A theater equipped with Dolby Atmos, the company’s most recent iteration of the technology, effectively envelops the audience. But by recreating exactly what your ear hears in any given scenario, binaural audio accomplishes a far more natural 3D sound without a costly armada of speakers. The technique at the heart of binaural audio can be traced back to Clement Ader, a 19th-century French engineer. In 1881, Ader devised the Theatrophone, a telephonic system of transmission to broadcast a Paris Opera show. Pairs of microphones were systematically spaced in front of the stage, covering the breadth from left to right. Signals from the show were then transmitted via telephone receivers to listeners on the other end. With a pair of receivers, one mounted on each ear, listeners could hear the show from their designated suites at the gallery of Palais de l’Industrie. In 1933, AT&T Bell Laboratories brought binaural audio to the Chicago World’s Fair. The acoustics research department of the company created a mechanical dummy, which it named Oscar, with microphones placed on its cheeks in front its ears. Oscar sat in a glass room capturing sounds while visitors gathered outside used headphones to hear exactly what the dummy heard. The technique revised the experience introduced by Ader, but both inventions offered poor sound quality. Through World War II and the decades that followed, progress in binaural faced significant obstacles: primitive techniques failed to achieve accurate, high-fidelity recordings. But in 1973, Neumann, a renowned German microphone company, introduced the breakthrough KU-80, a prototype binaural recording device. Neumann’s iteration consisted of a detached dummy head with microphones placed in the eardrums – the position captured cues with more precision than any of its predecessors. Three generations of dummy heads later, the KU-100, introduced in 1992, featured omnidirectional microphones, expertly preserving the spatial cues and the overall quality of sound. It continues to be the go-to dummy head for binaural recordings. Binaural audio found a home in select audio recording communities: the technology worked well for radio plays and experimental sound art. Meanwhile, musicians like Lou Reed, Thom Yorke, and Imogen Heap have all experimented with binaural audio productions. Most recently, the ASMR (Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response) community has been employing binaural recordings to trigger physical responses that they believe can be soothing and calming. Now, almost a century after the demise of the Theatrophones, investors are starting to revisit 3D audio technology: the prototype of Sony’s VR headset Project Morpheus includes a custom 3D audio binaural solution in its development kit. ""3D audio adds to the feeling of presence that we strive so hard to achieve with the visuals in VR,"" says Richard Marks, senior director of research and development at Sony Computer Entertainment America. ""When sound is perceived to come from the same direction as a visual stimulus, the credibility of the virtual experience is greatly increased. While purely visual VR experiences can be made, adding 3D audio greatly magnifies the impact and depth of a VR experience."" 3D audio offers a more expansive experience than its visual counterpart. ""Unlike with the visuals, 3D audio is not limited to the field of view of the display and can be rendered to give a 'complete 360-degree' experience,"" says Marks. ""One of the biggest challenges for VR design is that the user can look in any direction, and may not even be looking when something momentous occurs. But using a 3D audio cue, it is possible to steer the user’s attention to look in the direction of the sound, similar to techniques that are used in live theater."" Video director Chris Milk — who’s previously done work for Kanye West, U2, and Arcade Fire — has harnessed the immersive capabilities of binaural recording to bring concerts to the virtual arena. Last year, he produced ""Hello, Again,"" a revolutionary VR film of a Beck concert. To match the 360-degree visual experience, Milk developed a binaural system to produce 360-directional sound. ""If we were going to let you look in every direction, a one-directional sound source would not work,"" he says. ""You would look behind but you would still hear as if you were looking in front of you. So we needed something that would dynamically change based on where you were looking in the visual."" He ingeniously devised a system that used an omni-binaural head with eight ears, with four pairs of 3Dio’s Free Space microphones implanted at every 90 degrees. He followed it up with a software that would process the sound from those ears to provide the effect necessary. Viewed with a VR headset, the binaural sound on the headphones matched the visual illusion of the Beck video every step of the way. Jean-Pascal Beaudoin, the director of Apollo Studios, stresses the importance of 3D audio for VR experiences. ""If a sound is clearly coming from your left, and you turn your head 90 degrees to look in that direction, you now expect that sound to be located right in front of you,"" says Beaudoin. ""If it isn’t, and it’s still at your left, chances are you’ll be pulled out of the experience before you even realize it."" Beaudoin provides 3D sound for VR experiences produced by Felix & Paul Studios, the VR production company commissioned by Samsung Gear to produce a series of 360-degree live action videos. ""I am most interested in the creative possibilities that 3D audio opens up in terms of storytelling, emotions, and interactivity,"" says Beaudoin. ""We are barely scratching the surface of the merging VR medium, but with each project, we make progress in establishing a new grammar."" Despite its potential, binaural audio is not widespread within the VR content world yet. ""Audio sometimes takes a back seat in content production,"" says Adam Somers, lead audio engineer at Jaunt, a Palo Alto-based developer and one-stop shop for capturing and creating cinematic virtual reality. ""So much work goes into visual elements, whether it’s a game or film, that sometimes audio is an afterthought. But talking about VR as a medium for content, it’s really important that the medium has the capability of binaural audio built in from the beginning to make it easier for content creators to utilize binaural audio."" Jaunt ensures the presence of binaural audio in every piece of content created through their platform. Back in Manhattan, Choueiri is considering another problem: since the inception of the technology, binaural audio has been reserved for headphone listening. But Choueiri wants to make the technology accessible over external speaker systems for a wider audience. The challenge is that with speakers, a right ear not only hears its respective cues, but also picks up information meant for the left ear. ""It messes up the cues, so instead of hearing 3D sound, the brain just locates the speakers,"" Choueiri said. ""It’s like watching 3D movies without the glasses on."" For decades, this confusing crosstalk between speakers has perplexed the audio community. But Choueiri’s BACCH SP, a filter that enables a pair of speakers to retain the aural cues, creates the illusion of 3D audio for the listeners. Jawbone has employed Princeton University’s algorithm over the last two years to create the LiveAudio filter for its wireless bluetooth speaker, Jambox. Loading the mini-speaker with the digital filter optimizes audio to create a three-dimensional experience. While effective, the experience is limited to a sweet spot — the device needs to be centered in relation to the listener. The illusion instantly collapses when the listener moves from the spot. Choueiri says a version of that software, the BACCH-dSP app, coupled with a head-tracking feature, can sustain the illusion irrespective of the listener’s head movements. That app is scheduled to show up in the store for Mac OS soon, bringing 3D audio experiences to laptops. Slowly but surely, binaural is becoming a linchpin in virtual reality development. Oculus’ most recent prototype, Crescent Bay, unveiled at CES last month, integrates binaural technology with Rift’s head tracking for complete audio-visual immersion. And while Sony’s Project Morpheus hasn’t announced final specifications of the product yet, their emphasis on 3D audio is evident. As Adam Somers of Jaunt put it, ""Binaural audio is critical to an immersive experience within the context of VR. We consider audio to be 50 percent of the immersive experience.""",0.75362464094925,0.24637535905075003,0.20769857739143702,2075,5.1812048192771085,977,6.7594677584442167,1,16,"Business, Tech, Features, Longform"

It sounded like a throwaway side project from someone who’s never seen a side project he doesn’t like. But it’s a very smart move, and one that’s more central to Musk’s ambitions than it might seem. To understand why, it helps to look not at Tesla, but at SolarCity, a company chaired by Musk and run by his cousin Lyndon Rive. SolarCity installs panels on people’s roofs, leases them for less than they’d be paying in energy bills, and sells surplus energy back to the local utility. It’s proven a tremendously successful model. Founded in 2006, the company now has 168,000 customers and controls 39 percent of the rapidly expanding residential solar market. When you have a lot of solar, you need a lot of batteries Fueled by financing systems like SolarCity’s, government subsidies, and a rapid drop in the price of photovoltaics, solar has been growing fast. But with that growth, some of solar’s downsides are coming to the fore. Obviously, the sun isn’t always shining when you need power, and sometimes the sun is shining when you don’t need power. The former is a problem for the user, who needs to draw on the grid when it’s cloudy or dark; the latter is a problem for the grid, which needs to find a place for that excess energy to go. When there’s a lot of solar in the system, it can get hard to keep the grid balanced. That’s part of the reason that California, with one of the most aggressive renewable energy mandates in the country, recently declared the most aggressive energy storage mandate as well, with a goal of 1.3 gigawatts of storage by 2020. As other states adopt intermittent renewables like solar and wind, they’ll need to install energy storage too, providing a ready and waiting market for Tesla’s batteries.   Forecast storage market from GTM Research. This has been part of the plan for the Gigafactory all along. At an event in New York last fall announcing plans for SolarCity to build a gigantic PV-panel factory, Musk and Rive mentioned that every SolarCity unit would come with battery storage within five to ten years, and that the systems would supply power at a lower cost than natural gas. Those batteries will come from the gigafactory, currently being built in Nevada. Once the factory comes online, the strong demand for energy storage will allow it to immediately ramp up production and achieve economies of scale. Tesla CTO JB Straubel (who has said that he ""might love batteries more than cars"") says that the market for stationary batteries ""can scale faster than automotive"" and that a full 30 percent of the gigafactory will be dedicated to them. ""I might love batteries more than cars."" Indeed, SolarCity has already begun installing Tesla batteries, mostly on commercial buildings like Walmart stores, which have to pay higher rates when they use lots of power during peak hours. Tesla’s batteries let them store up solar power when they don’t need it, then use it when rates are high, shaving 20-30 percent off their energy bills, according to Ravi Manghani, an analyst at GTM Research. SolarCity is also running a pilot project with 500 homes in California, according to the company’s director of public affairs, Will Craven. The project uses Tesla’s 10-kilowatt-hour battery packs and can power homes for about two days in the event of an outage, Craven says. The prospect of cheap solar panels combined with powerful batteries has been a source of significant anxiety in the utility sector. In 2013, the Edison Electric Institute, the trade group for investor-owned electric companies, issued a report warning that disruption was coming. ""One can imagine a day when battery storage technology or micro turbines could allow customers to be electric grid independent,"" the report said, likening the speed of the coming transition to the one from landlines to cellphones 10 years ago. Suddenly regulated monopolies are finding themselves in competition with their own customers. Utilities have been anxious about this for years They haven’t had to deal with this on the residential side yet, primarily because people can sell excess power back to the utilities at fairly high rates — a practice called net metering. But that’s hurting utilities, too, and some have tried to lower the price at which they buy back power, which has been met by furious protests from people leasing panels. If utilities lower the buyback rate too much, however, and batteries get cheap enough, people may just unplug from the grid altogether — or more likely, install systems that let them rely on it only rarely — prompting what those in the industry call ""the utility death spiral."" It’s quite a bind: by fighting net metering, utilities would help make battery storage more economically viable, driving the transition to a distributed grid. Manghani believes utilities aren’t doomed, but they may undergo a radical transformation, becoming something closer to service providers and minders of an increasingly distributed grid rather than the centralized power producers they are today. Such a system would require lots of batteries to help balance the load and supply extra power during peak times, which is why GTM estimates the market will grow from $48 million today to about $1 billion in 2018. This is the position SolarCity is taking as well. Last April, Peter Rive, SolarCity’s CTO, wrote that the company had no interest in prompting mass defections from the grid. ""When batteries are optimized across the grid, they can direct clean solar electricity where (and when) it is needed most, lowering costs for utilities and for all ratepayers,"" he wrote. Utilities are in the best position to direct that electricity, he said, inviting utility operators to contact him. Will Craven, Solar City’s director of public affairs, calls it ""infrastructure as a service."" Utilities aren’t doomed, but they may undergo a radical transformation It would be a tricky transition, but some utilities may be open to it. During an earnings call last year, Straubel, Tesla’s CTO, said they were working with utilities. ""The long-term demand for stationary energy storage is extraordinary,"" he said. ""We’ve done a huge amount of effort there and have talked to major utilities and energy service companies."" Another potential bright spot for utilities is Tesla itself. If electric vehicles take off, demand for power will go up, helping compensate for people whose homes are relying less on the grid.  ""They’re part of the electricity network."" All this is very good news for Musk, who starts to look less like a carmaker and more like the architect of a vertically integrated energy company, with SolarCity making solar panels that send power to Tesla batteries, both in the home and on the road. ""They’re not just carmakers,"" Manghani says. ""They’re part of the electricity network. At least folks in the energy industry are very well aware of Tesla as a battery maker.""

This week, the Internet.org app arrives in India, allowing locals free access to Facebook and a curated list of services that Facebook likes. On the surface, it seems like a net positive for India and for humanity, bringing more connectivity and information to people who might not otherwise be able to afford it. But every good thing comes at a price, and in the case of Internet.org, that price is net neutrality. Despite its name, net neutrality is not a neutral concept. It has the positive goal of ensuring fairness and equitable treatment — both for users accessing the internet and for companies offering their services online. Net neutrality demands that all internet traffic, irrespective of its source, content, or destination, be treated equally. Internet.org is doing the exact opposite of that by setting up a dichotomy between the internet that is paid for and the free, Facebook-approved version.   Subsidized data breeding Facebook dependency Before its deal with Indian mobile operator Reliance, Facebook had sealed agreements with Airtel (covering Ghana, Kenya, and Zambia) and Tigo (for Colombia and Tanzania). In all those countries, Internet.org allows free browsing within Facebook and its surrounding bubble of whitelisted services, but users are warned that they’ll incur data charges if they try to access links to elsewhere on the web. Internet, meet your new gatekeeper. Web inventor Sir Tim Berners-Lee recently spoke out against precisely this type of so-called positive traffic discrimination: where one set of apps and services are privileged over another by discounting rather than raising prices. It may seem beneficial in the short term, but it’s a formula for starving out competition and ultimately stagnating the market for available web services. Users of Internet.org in India will get Bing, AccuWeather, and BBC News for free, but will have to pay to access Google search, Yahoo Weather, or any other local alternatives. ""Imagine if a new startup or service provider had to ask permission from or pay a fee to a competitor before they could attract customers,"" writes Berners-Lee. He worries about telcos and mobile carriers gaining the excessive power of handpicking the winners and losers, but with Internet.org, it is Facebook that’s wielding that gavel. Neither Facebook nor Reliance has disclosed the details of how Internet.org services are selected or their providers compensated. At the turn of the century, American tech companies and startups found a new frontier for innovation on the internet and engaged in an open, relatively equitable competition to see who was best. That’s how Amazon, eBay, Google, and yes, even Facebook rose to their present positions of preeminence. But now Facebook is heading out to other countries and setting up a first-mover advantage for itself that would preclude the same sort of open competition. The Indian Mark Zuckerberg stands little chance of ousting Facebook if his service costs more to access than the subsidized US original.   ""We're doing Internet.org to serve our mission of connecting the world rather than trying to make a profit anytime soon."" Responding to criticism about Facebook serving its own commercial interests under the guise of philanthropy, Zuckerberg says, ""We're doing Internet.org to serve our mission of connecting the world rather than trying to make a profit anytime soon. We could make much more money from advertising to rich people than we'd make from advertising to people who can't afford internet access."" And yet, his solution to a shortage of internet connectivity is to provide access to only a small, Facebook-dominated segment of the web. Before the Internet.org version of a free circumscribed internet, there was AOL and its deluge of free trial CDs. The first experience of the internet for many Americans was through AOL’s program, which took them online via a dial-up modem and sought to keep them ensnared within AOL’s distilled version of the web. As with Facebook today, the initial incentive was free internet access that led to a set of services without immediate competition. If you wanted news, weather, horoscopes, messaging, or email, and you were just starting out on the web with AOL, you probably got them all from AOL. Yahoo tried to achieve a similar one-stop-shop version of the web, as did Microsoft with MSN. Like AOL in the '90s, Facebook wants to be the very first ""internet"" that people experience Acting as an internet gateway is predicated on funneling users through your particular gate, which Microsoft achieved with the prevalence of Internet Explorer, AOL did with its CDs, and Facebook is now doing by subsidizing access to its services. Over time, though, all internet portals have eventually disintegrated and had to let in the full spectrum of the web, which could well be Facebook's intention with Internet.org. In the best case scenario, Facebook's subsidized data deals will be only a transitory stage on the way to more ambitious projects like its internet-beaming satellites and drones. Most people draw no clear distinction between the internet and the web, because the web is the most immediate and direct way to experience the benefits of the vast computer network that connects the globe. Facebook’s ambition is to achieve the same status, to reach a point where internet users and Facebook users overlap to such an extent that they become unaware of the difference between the two. It sounds preposterous, but then Facebook’s scale is already preposterous. A social network that began life on the web is gradually starting to eat the web up, with brands prioritizing their Facebook pages over their own domains and the former craze for search engine optimization being replaced by Facebook shareability. What Facebook is doing with Internet.org isn’t strictly unfair. Every supermarket on the planet does discounts to incentivize more buyers, and big companies pour billions into advertising every year in order to amplify and protect their size advantage. Like a shrewd marketer, Facebook is investing in associating its name with a good thing — the internet — and establishing that as a permanent and indelible connection in its users’ minds. But it’s an effort that benefits only a select few beyond Facebook, and the company has kept quiet on the specifics of how it selects Internet.org services and who is paid what. Is free Facebook the same thing as free internet? ""More than a billion people in India don’t have access to the internet,"" writes Mark Zuckerberg. ""That means they can’t enjoy the same opportunities many of us take for granted, and the entire world is robbed of their ideas and creativity."" Ironically, the practical impact of Internet.org will be to make it harder for Indian creativity to be expressed in the form of new mobile services. Any new startup that doesn’t get Facebook’s Internet.org blessing will have to struggle against better established competition that is also cheaper to access. How can India hope to recreate the success of Silicon Valley if Silicon Valley captures all the opportunity presented by the internet before local alternatives have a chance to develop and grow? When we buy Facebook’s free internet, we pay for it with our freedom to explore and exploit the full breadth of the web. Instead of enabling Ghanaians, Indians, and Colombians to create their own internet tools and services, Internet.org is converting them into captive consumers. The whole world would benefit from greater access to the internet, but it must be the whole internet, not just Planet Facebook.",0.6475907451633572,0.35240925483664276,0.8469255989734897,1284,5.2149532710280377,626,6.4920127795527156,0,4,"Business, US & World, Web, Report"

Throughout the month, Bill will be sharing his vision of how technology will revolutionize life for the world's poor by 2030 by narrating episodes of the Big Future, our animated explainer series. In addition, we'll be publishing a series of features exploring the improvements in banking, health, farming, and education that will enable that revolution. And while the topics reflect the bets Bill and his wife Melinda are making with their foundation, they've asked us for nothing less than fully independent Verge journalism, which we're more than happy to deliver. Turns out Bill Gates is a pretty confident guy. Nilay Patel, Editor-in-Chief In 2012, a 15-year-old named Battushig Myanganbayar aced a circuits and electronics course designed for sophomores at MIT — from his school in Ulan Bator, Mongolia. Myanganbayar had watched lectures in English, a second language, and worked through the course material online with the help of a visiting Stanford Ph.D. candidate, Tony Kim. ""If Battushig, at the age of 15, were a student at MIT, he would be one of the top students — if not the top,"" Kim told The New York Times. In fact, Myanganbayar went on to MIT a year later — crediting the online course as a ""watershed"" moment. Myanganbayar’s success is a testament to the power of online educational programs: thanks to revolutionary technology, a prodigious student has access to the education of his dreams. Today, Myanganbayar is even working with edX, the Harvard-MIT joint partnership behind the original course he took from Mongolia, to improve the experience for future students. Behind the student’s story, though, is a larger question: can online classes be used to help not just a few exceptional students, but the developing world at large? In his foundation’s 2015 annual letter, Bill Gates describes a future in which world-class education is only a few taps away, for anyone in the world. ""Before a child even starts primary school, she will be able to use her mom’s smartphone to learn her numbers and letters, giving her a big head start,"" he speculates. ""Software will be able to see when she’s having trouble with the material and adjust for her pace. She will collaborate with teachers and other students in a much richer way."" Career paths, Gates speculates, will be built into this new education system — students will be able to lift themselves out of poverty by figuring out the requirements for their chosen field and fulfilling them with online classes. And software will connect students to distant teachers and each other. While the concept of remote learning is as old as correspondence courses, today it’s often discussed in the context of massively open online courses, or MOOCs. Organized by companies, universities, and nonprofits, MOOCs provide education in the form of online lectures, quizzes, and projects, allowing large numbers of students to learn at a flexible pace. There’s no single definition for what constitutes a MOOC: some academics have split the term into ""connectivist""  cMOOCs — which emphasize learning among a loose network of students — and more centralized xMOOCs, which are often traditional college courses expanded to fit tens of thousands of remote pupils. And researchers still aren’t quite sure how to measure MOOCs’ overall impact. ""We’re the World Bank, so we like to have data on all the stuff we say, right?"" says Michael Trucano, a World Bank technology and education specialist who writes frequently about MOOCs. ""There frankly isn’t a lot of good data on this, at all."" Coursera, the largest and arguably best-known MOOC platform, claims a total of 11 million students, who can sign up for hundreds of classes from professors at Yale, Princeton, Stanford, and other universities. Classes are free, but students can purchase ""verified certificates"" for a single class or work towards mini-degrees in subjects like entrepreneurship or cloud computing. About a third of Coursera’s user base, says president and co-founder Daphne Koller, is from the developing world. While students like Myanganbayar have used online classes as a springboard into a traditional top-notch education, Koller touts more practical success stories like Sharmeen Shehabuddin, a Bangladeshi activist who learned to run a successful bakery with online business classes. ""We see a lot of lifting up happening along our learners,"" she says. ""We hear anecdotal stories about people whose lives are entirely transformed."" Anant Agarwal, CEO of MOOC nonprofit edX, is similarly effusive about his platform. ""Education is a path to prosperity, better economics, jobs, and frankly, world peace,"" he says. ""An educated world is simply a better world."" In an interview with The Verge, Gates pointed to the highly successful Khan Academy — which doesn’t consider itself a MOOC, but operates similarly to one — as a sign of how far the technology of remote education has come, from an age when ""we were just sticking cameras in front of people and putting them online."" In 15 years, he speculates, ""that type of material will be wildly better than even the best is today, and it will be available through phones and tablets in a free form to anyone that’s got that internet connection."" But right now, which students are really benefiting from MOOCs and the boom in online education? And will these services reach those who need education most? Globally available and extremely cheap, MOOCs have managed to attract a broad range of users. Khan Academy, for example, says 30 percent of its visitors are non-Americans. Clarissa Shen, VP of business development at MOOC company Udacity, says that ""our focus has been on the US to date, but even without much concerted effort, 60 percent of our students are international … We have had students win coding challenges hosted by multinational companies in Africa based on the skills they have gained in our courses … In Brazil, we’ve had Google and other tech companies host meet-ups for students who are interested in learning new tech skills, to also give them insight into how to get careers in tech."" MOOCs, though, are still best equipped to deal with the well-schooled and well-supported — a problem that’s reared its head from the concept’s beginning. Stanford professor, former Google X head, and Udacity founder Sebastian Thrun helped launch the MOOC movement in 2011 when he drew 160,000 students to an online version of his Stanford introductory artificial intelligence course. In 2013, Udacity and San Jose State University — supported by a Gates Foundation grant — attempted to expand the program, offering $150 online-only accredited courses for disadvantaged students. But in its first semester, participants performed far worse than their offline counterparts, and the pilot program was put on hold after six months (a scaled-down version was eventually relaunched, to some skepticism.) ""These were students from difficult neighborhoods, without good access to computers, and with all kinds of challenges in their lives,"" Thrun told Fast Company later that year. ""It’s a group for which this medium is not a good fit."" And unfortunately, that’s exactly the group that most needs education overseas. In countries where large parts of the population struggle with basic literacy — in Bangladesh, for example, only 62 percent of men and 53 percent of women can read and write — MOOCs usually offer higher-level courses aimed at the middle class. A University of Pennsylvania survey found that nearly 80 percent of Coursera students from developing countries already had a college degree, compared to less than 10 percent of the overall national population. ""MOOCs were heralded as a revolution in education access, and to some extent I think that’s true,"" says Brandon Alcorn, co-author of the study. But it’s a complicated truth. ""Yes, we’re seeing a lot of students from [developing countries], but they are students that have already received an education. They’re already the elites in their countries, if you will."" Or, as Trucano puts it: ""They’re the folks who have already figured out how to learn."" MOOC providers aren’t blind to the fact that their courses can favor the elite. When I asked how they were improving access, platforms like Khan Academy and Coursera pointed to their work in bridging language barriers — early MOOCs overwhelmingly favored English, but companies have been pushing resources into adding translated versions or partnering with local universities. ""If a majority of people taking the courses already have a degree, then we are not completely fulfilling our mission, which is to provide education for people who need it the most,"" says Agarwal of edX. So far, he says that around two-thirds of all edX students have a bachelor’s degree or higher, but the organization launched a program for high-schoolers last year which could tip that balance. Even so, edX isn’t designed for developing basic skills like literacy — which Gates calls one of the most important near-future goals — or even computer literacy. Neither is Coursera, which prides itself on offering top-level university courses. For someone with no computer skills, ""I don’t think Coursera will be the place for them to start,"" says Koller. ""We all realize we need to solve the problem of the digital divide, whether it’s the basic access problem … [or the] basic literacy skills. You certainly need to learn to read and write in order to learn to use the internet effectively."" And that, she says, is beyond the company’s scope. She believes that other organizations can step in and fill that gap better than Coursera, but it’s still a sign of how far we are from Gates’ vision of universal online education. Well-connected autodidacts can draw a lot from online courses, but others have stumbled over these access and literacy problems. University of Reading MOOC expert Tharindu Liyanagunawardena, for example, carried out an in-depth study of Sri Lanka’s attempt to fold online coursework into its general educational program, gathering data from 2009 to 2011. In surveys, students expressed fears that the internet could end up putting course materials out of reach. Less than half the participants had online access at home: one student reported taking 45-minute bus rides to get to a regional center where internet was available; another had access to a computer, but no understanding of how to use it. While students might have money for normal course fees, ""not everybody can afford to have internet access from home nor everyone can use the internet,"" said one respondent. ""Children of ordinary families will face difficulty in pursuing a degree."" For MOOC platforms, Gates’ vision — a wave of smartphones that can act as ubiquitous, cheap computers — is central to solving this problem. And unfortunately, we’re not there yet. It’s true that where wired broadband networks have failed to make inroads, mobile phones are connecting citizens for the first time; a 2013 Pew Research Center study found cellphones were ""almost omnipresent"" in many countries, even ones where comparatively few people went online. The vast majority of these devices, though, were still feature phones, which offer only basic internet access. Major platforms like Coursera and Khan Academy integrate low-bandwidth interactive elements like quizzes. But they rely heavily on video to make lessons accessible and entertaining, and major platforms are still planning for the smartphone boom that Agarwal, at least, sees as inevitable: ""We do need some basic capability,"" he explains. Eighty-one percent of edX students still view material on a desktop computer, while 12 percent use a mobile phone and 7 percent use a tablet. ""It’s actually rather challenging to get [Coursera] content even onto a smartphone, because there is a lot of visual material in some of our courses,"" says Koller, and feature phones would require ""a completely different model for teaching."" Most MOOCs have started releasing mobile apps or letting students download lectures for later viewing offline, but by and large, they’re waiting for hardware to catch up. In addition, companies like Coursera believe that focusing on a country’s most privileged students can boost the entire economy. ""People have often asked me, well, aren’t you focusing on the wrong part of the problem?"" says Koller. ""We all of course are strong believers in the moral imperative of making sure everyone is literate and has access to basic education. But if you think about the economic benefit of taking someone who is pre-literate and giving them four years of education, versus taking someone who’s more or less high school-level and giving them four years of education, the latter have a much bigger effect in terms of the society around them,"" whether through entrepreneurship or educating their own families. EdX’s Agarwal has a loftier vision: build a good online education program, and the delivery system will follow — for everyone. ""We’re already hearing from a number of governments that if high-quality content begins to become available on mobile, then the governments will begin investing in infrastructure,"" Agarwal says. He mentions a $40 tablet called the Aakash, sold in bulk to Indian educators. ""It’s much cheaper to provide that to kids and to provide bandwidth than to build lots of brick-and-mortar institutions. So we believe … that bandwidth and devices will come, so we decided to really focus on high-quality content."" The counterargument, raised in Gates’ letter, is that glossing over inequality could end up exacerbating the very social problems education is supposed to solve — calcifying gaps between rich and poor, rural and urban, or male and female students. EdX, for example, says about 60 percent of its students in developing countries are male, and the University of Pennsylvania study found roughly the same split in Coursera classes; the emerging BRICS countries of Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa had an even starker disparity of around 68 percent men to 31 percent women. ""Just introducing technology into education doesn’t actually act as a silver bullet,"" says Ronda Zelezny-Green, a mobile learning expert and PhD candidate at Royal Holloway, University of London. ""There’s a lot more work that needs to be done around attitudes and approaches."" Social norms and economic realities can make it harder for women to participate in online education — parents can discourage girls from using mobile phones, for example, because they worry mobile phones will become a way for them to secretly communicate with boys. Literacy rates for girls are markedly lower in many developing countries, and girls may be hesitant to actively participate in courses. (Coursera even warned me to take its own gender statistics with a grain of salt, saying women were less likely to fill out its surveys.) Zelezny-Green thinks online education can be transformative, but she’s skeptical of centralized MOOCs. ""With a lot of the ed-tech rollouts, people approach it as if we in the developed world have it all figured out,"" she says. ""We need to take a bit more of a nuanced approach to develop a way of integrating technology that actually makes sense for the local context."" Zelezny-Green and some other educators are starting to address the gender gap by working directly with communities. In 2012 and 2013, she visited students at a girls’ school in Nairobi, Kenya, looking at the role of mobile phones in their education. Phones weren’t used for online courses — in fact, teachers, parents, and even some students worried they were a distraction. But girls could use them to call friends and teachers to catch up on missed lessons, contact sponsors who could pay their school fees, or do their own basic online research. ""If I get some things that I think I need to know more about I’m going to just Google them,"" explained one student. And some targeted programs are already creating new opportunities. In Afghanistan, where female literacy hovers around 12 percent, smartphone apps and simple text messaging programs have helped women learn to read and write in private. Last summer, the Saudi Arabian Ministry of Labor used edX’s open source platform to create its own MOOC portal, providing online classes tailored to women, students with disabilities, and others who might not be able to physically attend school. Once again, this isn’t a silver bullet — if Saudi women aren’t getting the face-to-face instruction that Saudi men receive, they’re still missing out on an important element of education. But Trucano says that even with this double standard, it’s better than nothing. ""Some girls from some families … [will] have access to higher education that they now [don’t], because they have access to online universities,"" he says. ""We’ve seen programs in West Africa and Senegal, in Algeria, where girls have seen that they can participate in online communities as a learner, and not first and foremost as a girl."" These kinds of successes can happen when educators focus on the offline complications of online learning. For a service like Coursera, ""I personally think there would have to be a lot of work done to understand the on-the-ground realities,"" says Zelezny-Green. ""What I sometimes find is that with online education tools, they offer things that are actually not that needed, or aren’t going to have immediate benefits to someone who’s taking it."" Zelezny-Green praises localized online initiatives like the African Virtual University and the Planet Earth Institute, which work towards online education and scientific research from a specifically African perspective. ""Development as a concept has been around since the ‘30s or ‘40s, and look at how far we’ve gotten — which is not that far! We still have such great disparities between the Global North and the Global South,"" she says. ""I think there’s already kind of an awareness-raising process happening, where people in Sub-Saharan Africa, in Southeast Asia, [are] starting to ask, 'Well, where’s the stuff for us that’s by us, that we’ve created?'"" Kepler, an experimental nonprofit education program in Rwanda, is a blend of Western MOOCs and on-the-ground teaching. Starting with 50 students in 2013, it currently serves 150, and CEO Chris Hedrick says the organization is recruiting another 160 for the next class. Students are placed in dorms with electricity and internet connections, where they’ll have access to both MOOC course materials and support from Rwandan instructors. ""I don’t want to have any Americans involved at the local level three years from now,"" says Hedrick. Students earn credit through a partnership with the College for America, a flexible degree program founded in 2012 (with a grant from the Gates Foundation), and Hedrick works with local businesses to help prepare graduates for jobs. In addition to math, science, or business MOOCs, students are trained in typing and basic software applications like Excel. ""I think it would be very difficult for many of our students to be successful"" without this blended learning model, says Hedrick, who claims that they’re all currently on track to earn a two-year associate arts degree. ""And what we do is tie it into the skills that they need in the workplace and the skills that they need to master for their degrees."" Looking at the work that’s gone into Kepler, it’s tempting to wonder how much MOOCs are actually contributing to its success. Couldn’t the real key be small, intensive programs that give students easy access to employers, technology, and face-to-face instruction? But to Hedrick, online classes are what make the rest possible. At the most basic level, there’s the cache that comes from having a degree from an American program. And with the course material provided for free, Kepler can spend its resources on hiring local facilitators and building relationships with older institutions. ""What we’re trying to develop here, and what I hope will develop all over Africa as we grow, is a really good interchange with the existing traditional universities,"" he says. ""Where they can leverage the things that we’ve learned and incorporate them into what they’re doing."" ""For me, success isn’t that Kepler has a million students 10 years from now,"" says Hedrick. ""Success is that access has dramatically increased, and relevance and quality of education has increased. Some of that will be because of what we’re doing directly, but probably more of it — if we’re successful — is because we’ve influenced others."" MOOCs were once looked to as a central solution to a global problem. But increasingly, they resemble building blocks — less a classroom, and more of a massive open library for students and teachers across the world.

That figure is $44 million — less than projected. The discrepancy between expectations and reality has led to gloomy projections for the weed business from some corners, but others have argued the figure doesn't take into account the additional revenue provided by medical marijuana. Add that number and the figure rises to $76 million. Animal notes that the $44 million also doesn't factor in money earned from less direct sources — pot fans who chose to travel to the state to indulge their tastes, advertising purchased by weed growers, and the money saved when police don't have to prosecute people for having a puff. Add medical marijuana too, and the figure hits $76 million Even if the tax revenue is a decrease on projections, a slightly slow start is to be expected. Like the plants themselves, the entire industry has had to be grown in size, with the product no longer coming from illegal grow rooms, but giant state-approved farms and greenhouses. In 2013, just before Colorado legalized pot, The Wall Street Journal reported on the difficulties growers had in turning a profit in the nascent industry, given the labor-intensive nature of the jobs and the lack of investment. That's changing now, as a number of investors have stepped in with cash for weed-based products. Y Combinator, the accelerator who provided money for Reddit, Dropbox, and Stripe — among other startups — recently backed medical marijuana delivery app Meadow, its first step into the industry.

Tesla is still deciding on a date for unveiling the new unit, but Musk said he was pleased with the result, calling the pack ""really great"" and voicing his excitement for the project.

Today, the FTC and law enforcement groups from all 50 states have filed a complaint against the Cancer Fund of America, Cancer Support Services, Children’s Cancer Fund of America, and the Breast Cancer Society. The complaint alleges that these four ""sham charities"" solicited millions in donations by promising to help pay for hospice care, chemotherapy, and other services for cancer patients. But only a fraction of that money actually went to patients. The rest went to company cars, high salaries, and even a Caribbean cruise. ""The defendants took in millions of dollars in donations meant to help cancer patients, but spent it on themselves and their fundraisers,"" says FTC consumer protection bureau director Jessica Rich. The charities employed for-profit fundraisers who ""typically"" received 80 percent or more of every dollar raised, providing little oversight. Between 2008 and 2012, the companies reportedly raised $187 million, and they reported $120 million in fundraising costs. The four charities spent between 2.4 percent and 3.4 percent of their money on actual aid. The remaining money went to employees who were often family and friends of the charities' operators. Most of what fundraisers told donors was allegedly misleading, and much was outright false. This included promises that ""one hundred percent of our proceeds go to hospice care,"" for organizations that didn't fund hospice services at all. Most of the funds went to for-profit fundraisers, cars, and vacations In order to cover up this fraud, the companies allegedly reported hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of ""gifts in kind,"" non-cash donations for items that would go to cancer sufferers. In reality, the complaint says, these items were often useless. The Cancer Fund of America, for example, passed on generic pre-packed care boxes containing things like ""sample-size soaps, shampoos, and other toiletries, over-the-counter medications, Little Debbie Snack Cakes, toys, disposable plates and plastic cutlery, scarves, batteries, women’s makeup, family-themed DVDs, adult-sized clothing, iPod Nano covers, gift wrap, blank seasonal greeting cards, candy, and/or children’s coloring books."" With these donations, however, the foundations ""created the illusion that they were both larger and more efficient with donors' donations than they really were."" They sent overstocked or discontinued merchandise to stock the boxes but reported the retail price, vastly inflating the value of ""donations."" Investigators outside the FTC had already raised red flags. The Center for Investigative Reporting exposed many of their practices in 2013, describing a cluster of fraudulent charities owned by a group of family members and close associates. The FTC blames the two-year delay in bringing a lawsuit on the need to collect enough information to bring a federal lawsuit in every state in the US. The agency has proposed federal settlements with several of the organizations and people involved. The Breast Cancer Society would pay $65.6 million, or the amount it took from donors between 2008 and 2012. Its former president James Reynolds II would pay $75,000, and former Cancer Support Society president Kyle Effler would pay $41.2 million, the amount that his group received. The Children's Cancer Fund of America would pay $30 million. They'll also all be banned from further fundraising efforts, although the Breast Cancer Society could spin off part of its efforts into a legitimate charity. State prosecutors can also pursue their own suits. The FTC has proposed settlements for three of the charities All four of the organizations appear to have scrubbed their web presence since the lawsuit. On the Breast Cancer Society's site, Reynolds II has posted a comment agreeing to the settlement but denouncing overzealous government scrutiny. ""As our operations expanded ... the threat of litigation from our government increased as well,"" he writes. ""While the organization, its officers and directors have not been found guilty of any allegations of wrong doing ... our Board of Directors has decided that it does not help those who we seek to serve, and those who remain in need, for us to engage in a highly publicized, expensive, and distracting legal battle around our fundraising practices.""

In a filing posted today, the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reaffirmed that Samsung had copied specific design patents in Apple's iPhone. But the court decided that Samsung wasn't infringing on Apple's overall trade dress — the look and feel of its phones. This means that while the damages Apple was granted for patent infringement will stand, the company's overall $930 million award will be downsized. The court's analysis hinged on the idea that trade dress had to be based on aesthetic decisions meant to make something visually distinctive, and that rules protecting it have to be balanced with ""a fundamental right to compete through imitation of a competitor’s product."" While Apple argued that the iPhone's rounded rectangle shape and rows of square apps were designed to give it a particular look that fit Apple's brand, the court cited Apple's previous claims that the shape was also easier to use. The same went for its app icons, which were attractive but also meant to make the iPhone more intuitive. The current legal fight between Samsung and Apple has been going on since 2011, when Apple alleged that several Samsung phones infringed on design and utility patents for its iPhone. In 2012, a court found that Samsung had indeed infringed on Apple's patents for ""bounce-back"" scrolling, multitouch gestures, and tap-to-zoom options on iOS. It also found that Samsung's phones had infringed on both officially registered and unregistered iPhone trade dress. Apple had requested $2.5 billion in damages, and it ended up getting slightly over $1 billion. Since then, Samsung and Apple have both been trying to tilt the ruling and the damages in their favor. Apple tried and failed to get a sales ban on the infringing phones and tablets (all of which have now been obsolete for several years), and it requested an additional $707 million from Samsung. It got neither of these; in fact, its original damages were recalculated and slightly cut back. Now that the earlier decision has been struck down, lower courts will have to calculate a new damages number. Samsung, however, has also had its share of disappointment. It lost a second patent battle to Apple in 2014, for the smaller amount of around $120 million. And this latest ruling reaffirms that it infringed on Apple's patents, so it's still going to be paying out in this case — just not as much as originally expected. Apple, for its part, is optimistic about the decision. ""We are pleased the Federal Circuit Court of Appeal confirmed Samsung blatantly copied Apple products,"" said a spokesperson on the news. ""This is a victory for design and those who respect it. Even though Samsung must pay for its widespread infringement of our patents, this case has always been about more than money. It’s about innovation and the hard work that goes into inventing products that people love, which is hard to put a price on."" And, of course, so is Samsung. ""We welcome the US Court of Appeals' ruling overturning Apple's infringement and damage claims against Samsung over trade dress,"" its spokesperson said. ""Today's decision shows that Apple's claims over trade dress and damages lack merit and are grossly exaggerated. We remain confident that our products do not infringe on Apple’s design patents and other intellectual property, and we will continue to take all appropriate measures to protect our products.""

Innocence of Muslims — a ""trailer"" for a low-budget film mocking the prophet Muhammad — sparked protests in the Islamic world, and YouTube even blocked it in some countries. But that's not why a US court ordered the service to take down the video early last year. That was the result of a disgruntled actor and a controversial copyright decision that judges now say infringed on Google's First Amendment rights. Today, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals is reversing that decision. Cindy Lee Garcia was one of several actors who say they were tricked into appearing in Innocence of Muslims, hired under the pretense that the director was creating a generic sword-and-sandals film instead of propaganda. The film's extreme anti-Islamic sentiments led an Egyptian cleric to call for the death of anyone associated with its production. As a result, Garcia and other members of the cast received death threats, despite being unaware of the film's content during the production process. Garcia sued to have the video suppressed, arguing that she owned the copyright on her short appearance in the film. Despite qualms, a court granted her a temporary injunction, ordering Google to take down the video. ""The mandatory injunction censored and suppressed a politically significant film."" Google argued that this set a dangerous precedent for both copyright and freedom of speech. Garcia had a very small part in the film's creation, and letting her suppress the final product could give anyone involved in a production control over it. Eventually, the Ninth Circuit court re-examined the case and reversed the decision, even expressing frustration that the decision had taken this long. ""The unconscionable result is that our court allowed an infringement of First Amendment rights to remain in effect for 15 months before we finally issued our opinion,"" wrote one. Another pointed out that however offensive the film, the lawsuit stopped people from seeing something that had become newsworthy. ""The takedown order was unwarranted and incorrect as a matter of law,"" wrote Judge Margaret McKeown. ""It also gave short shrift to the First Amendment values at stake. The mandatory injunction censored and suppressed a politically significant film — based upon a dubious and unprecedented theory of copyright.

In a series of rules announced today in a long-awaited response to the protests in Ferguson, Obama is prohibiting the federal government from providing select military-style equipment to local police. Other military-style weapons and vehicles are having their access limited, with requirements that police forces first explain in detail why they're needed, obtain approval from the local mayor or other governing body, adopt basic policing standards, and agree to collect data about their use.  ""The idea is to make sure that we strike a balance."" Banned items include ""tracked armored vehicles, weaponized aircraft and vehicles, bayonets, grenade launchers, and large-caliber firearms."" Controlled items include ""armored vehicles, tactical vehicles, riot gear, and specialized firearms and ammunition."" That still leaves access to quite a bit of military-style equipment — which the White House has argued is necessary, such as for responses to an incident like the Boston Marathon bombing — but it does limit access to some of the more extreme weaponry that police can obtain. Police will, however, still be able to acquire that equipment using state, local, or other funds. ""The idea is to make sure that we strike a balance in providing the equipment, which is appropriate and useful and important for local law enforcement agencies to keep the community safe, while at the same time putting standards in place,"" says Cecilia Muñoz, director of Obama’s Domestic Policy Council, according to The New York Times. Obama ordered the development of these rules back in January, acting in response to a review of military-style equipment in police forces, which was created following public outcry over the surprisingly militarized police force that pushed back on protestors in Ferguson. The new rules were developed by a federal group with representatives from the Justice Department, the Department of Defense, and Homeland Security. The group released its final report today, and Obama has instructed agencies to adhere to its recommendations. Regarding the prohibited equipment list, the group writes, ""the substantial risk of misusing or overusing these items, which are seen as militaristic in nature, could significantly undermine community trust and may encourage tactics and behaviors that are inconsistent with the premise of civilian law enforcement."" Obtaining controlled equipment requires adopting basic policing standards While the federal government is still allowing police to obtain some military-style equipment, requirements surrounding its acquisition is designed as a way to improve policing standards. Law enforcement agencies acquiring controlled equipment ""must adopt robust and specific written policies and protocols,"" the group writes, including policies that promote developing trust with a community, adhering to the Constitution, and using the equipment in an appropriate and supervised manner. It's not clear how effective these policies will be — and it's bewildering that some of them should even be necessary — but it appears to be an attempt to drive reform. Police who use or authorize the use of controlled equipment will have to receive annual training on these standards. They are also required to create a record of every ""significant incident"" where controlled equipment was used, keeping those records for at least three years afterward and providing them to the federal agency that supplied the equipment upon request. While these are basic record-keeping requirements, they could prove to be a critical asset should issues with these weapons occur in the future.

It’s hard to say when the first nude scene gave way to the first nude body double, but the practice dates back to at least 1934, when Olympic swimmer Josephine McKim stood in for actress Maureen O’Sullivan during a nude underwater ballet scene in Tarzan and His Mate. In the decades since, directors have found increasingly creative ways to hide the fact that a film’s steamiest scene might not actually feature the film’s lead actor: including, in recent years, a shift toward the use of CGI to augment, enhance, or completely create on-camera nudity.  Warning: video and photos may be considered NSFW. Many of us first became aware of this practice last month, during the final episode of the fifth season of Game of Thrones. In a deeply compelling scene, Cersei Lannister (Lena Headey) is forced to atone for her sins with a humiliating nude walk through the center of town, during which she’s both verbally and physically assaulted by an angry mob of townspeople. It’s a shocking, and at times painful, scene to watch — but it doesn’t actually feature Lena Headey’s body. Over the course of two days, the scene was shot twice: once with a clothed Headey, and once with a nude body double, with the two takes merged in post-production to create the illusion of a naked Headey.     The practice of using CGI to create the illusion of nudity dates back at least five years, when the Machete special effects team digitally removed Jessica Alba’s underwear to create the appearance of nudity. The Machete scene — which initially seemed to contradict Alba’s earlier statement that she’d never do a nude scene — caused a minor stir among fans and media, who began to debate whether Alba had ""tricked"" audiences with her CGI striptease — a notion that often seems to come up any time an actress has the audacity to reserve glimpses of her naked body to a limited audience. In the years since, the practice has appeared in a number of other films, including The Change-Up, Nurse 3D, and Very Good Girls — and, according to sources working in digital effects, a number of productions we don’t even know about. As digital effects become a more routine part of film production, it’s become increasingly easy — and affordable — to use them to enhance or alter a nude scene; all signs point to this practice being here to stay. A way for performers to have their cake and eat it too But even as prices of digital effects drop, they’re still more costly than just shooting a performer nude. So why are we seeing such a dramatic uptick in altered nudity? In the years since Machete, numerous theories have been floated. Some have suggested it’s a way to get around nudity banning clauses in performers' contracts, while others have seen it as a way for performers to have their cake and eat it too, receiving kudos for risks they didn’t actually undertake. According to one CGI editor, who requested anonymity, the truth of the matter is far simpler: directors offer the CGI option to make performers as comfortable as possible, and, in turn, to create the best scene possible. A performer who feels awkward stripping down in front of not just co-stars and a director, but a crew full of shooters, PAs, film assistants, and anyone else who might be present on set that day, is unlikely to turn in a stellar performance. Far better to shoot them in a more comfortable set up, and digitally add in the more risqué aspects of the scene after. Indeed, this explanation parallels Headey’s own for her choice to go CGI in her scene. When asked by reporters why she opted not to shoot the full scene herself, Headey cited the ability to focus on the emotions of the scene, rather than the emotional and physical discomfort of actually parading naked, not merely in front of a few co-stars and crew, but a massive crowd of extras performing incredible hostility. Headey’s filmography would suggest she’s hardly a prude, with nude appearances in a number of projects including Aberdeen, The Broken, and this year’s Zipper; so it feels hard to fault her for opting to go the digital route in this obviously grueling scene. (Interestingly, it was Headey’s previous nude work that made the walk of shame’s CGI easier to spot, as fans compared the Game of Thrones scene to her existing scenes.)  An enhanced ability to focus on their performance isn’t the only reason performers turn to CGI, however. For some, the same pressure to appear physically perfect that’s caused Photoshop to run rampant in magazine offices has led to more widespread use of CGI as a kind of foundation garment. The CGI editor I spoke with described this as the ""supermodel effect,"" where the ever presence of digitally altered bodies leads us to believe that these CGI creations are a standard we must all adhere to. ""It’s like pornography, where younger people see it, and it’s all they know"" — even though the sex depicted in pornography is unlikely to bear much resemblance to what many of us do at home. (Given the lower budgets of adult entertainment, on the other hand, the bodies we see in pornography are far less likely to be retouched.) With beauty work becoming a more regular part of post-production, it’s not much more effort to offer performers digital breast and butt lifts, or to swap out their nipples for a whole new look. Ultimately, digital effects allow filmmakers to craft a more perfect nude scene — whether by improving a cast member’s performance or by erasing their physical flaws — and for many, the temptation of digital nudity is hard to resist; especially if it represents a small addition to an already sizable CGI budget. Jim McBride isn’t thrilled with the turn toward CGI. The founder of Mr. Skin, a website devoted to tracking celebrity nude scenes, McBride has been maintaining an exhaustive list of celebrity nude scenes since his site launched in August 1999 (Disclosure: The parent company of MrSkin.com purchased Fleshbot.com from me in early 2014). In addition to providing detailed lists of when, where, and how female celebrities have shed their clothes on camera, the site also keeps viewers abreast of when those scenes feature the actress’s actual body — and when we’ve been served up a body double instead. Though Mr. Skin’s posts are celebratory in tone, equally excited to see any actress disrobe, regardless of her body type or age, the site has spawned numerous copycats and clones, many of whom view on-camera nudity through a more critical lens (which, it should be noted, might very well fuel some of the insecurity that leads performers to pursue some CGI assistance). ""We would prefer that the actress did her own nude scenes, that would be our number one choice,"" he says. But he also doesn’t see digitally enhanced nude scenes as anything new: ""It’s no different than when they were doing body doubles through the years… Not every movie actress is going to want to do a nude scene. Maybe something’s wrong with her body at the time, or maybe some other actress had a better butt, so they use a body double. There’ve always been body doubles, there’ve always been scenes where there was nudity and it wasn’t the actress you thought it was. This has been going on forever."" Digital breast lifts, butt lifts, and nipple swaps What’s different now, however, is that CGI makes those body doubles more difficult to detect. In previous eras, a nude shot that featured body as well as face was very likely to be real; nowadays, it’s harder to guarantee that that’s actually the case. For McBride, it was 2011’s The Change-Up — which featured ""nude"" scenes of both Leslie Mann and Olivia Wilde — that made the promise (or, depending on your view, danger) of CGI nudity all too clear. ""[Leslie Mann] did this incredible topless scene, but it was all done in post-production. And she admitted it on Jimmy Kimmel after the fact. I remember seeing that nude scene… and finding out later that it wasn’t her, and thinking, ‘Uh oh, it’s going to be a lot tougher to know if it’s an actress or not.'"" McBride remains confident that — whether it’s through DVD extras, interviews, or leaks to the press — the truth will always come out. But others aren’t so sure. When asked what percentage of nude scenes are faked, the CGI editor I spoke with wouldn’t even hazard a guess. ""A lot of times those things are kept really low key,"" he says. ""There’s a lot of beauty work in a lot of movies… but in terms of nudity, I don’t know."" Studios that are paying editors a good deal of money to create the illusion of nude scenes have a lot of incentive to keep their work under wraps: as my source put it, ""the best visual effects are the ones you don’t see."" That tendency toward secrecy can fuel an audience’s sense that they’re being subjected to trickery — or, when the truth comes out about a digitally altered scene, that they’ve been the victims of nudity-filled bait and switch. In the aftermath of the Game of Thrones finale, none other than Howard Stern felt compelled to speak out about how the scene had betrayed him. As McBride describes Stern’s reaction, ""It was such a let down when he found out, when they went on our website and we talked about how it wasn’t Lena Headey… He was really upset about it. He felt cheated, he felt that, ‘Wow, I’ve invested five seasons in this show, I think Lena Headey’s beautiful, and she finally did this amazing nude scene...’ and then he found out it wasn’t her, and he felt bad."" The uncomfortable notion that actresses owe audiences their nudity For McBride, Stern’s reaction is a great example of the betrayal fans can feel when they’re fooled by a well-done body double or CGI. But for others, the notion that actresses might owe audiences their nudity as thanks for their viewership can be an uncomfortable one, particularly in a world where a similar notion has sparked massive violations of privacy, like last summer’s Celebgate. It’s hard to ignore the fact that much of the outrage around faked nudity doubles as outrage that a woman has not given up the goods. It can be hard to even track down discussions of male celebrities’ nude scenes, period; and high-profile instances of faked nudity — like Mark Wahlberg’s prosthetic penis in Boogie Nights — tend to be greeted with humor rather than anger. But perhaps it’s possible to read this reaction as something more than just a churlish demand that actresses show us their boobs. As consumers of modern media, we’re frequently forced to suspend our disbelief: to accept Zoe Saldana as a green-skinned alien, or a de-aged Michael Douglas as the genuine article, or that King’s Cross Station has a magic, hidden platform through which child wizards access a secret train. Up until now, nude scenes — which have been hard to seamlessly fake for so long — have offered an oasis of authenticity in a landscape of pretend. Whatever character an actor is playing, whatever fantasy they’re creating, when their clothes have come off, we’ve been offered a genuine moment of intimacy with another human being.

That's exactly what I envisioned when I first heard of the Mad Max game, which is set in the same universe and stars the same titular character, but is otherwise divorced from Fury Road. I'm glad to say I was wrong. WB Games has brought Mad Max to Gamescom here in Cologne, and I was among the first to try it at the show. My fretful apprehension going into the demo was quickly replaced by fascination: you wouldn't think there'd be much diversity to what you can do in a vast desert world with only a few scraps of metal lying around, but Mad Max belies expectations in many ways. The game's centered on Max's automobile, which isn't his iconic Interceptor but rather a Frankensteinian concoction of post-apocalyptic detritus.  Mad Max is full of explosive, gleeful, destructive fun My first task in the game was to tear down some structures, which I did by deploying a harpoon gun and mashing the accelerator. Explosions are fun and all, but literally yanking a tower down with brute force just felt so much more satisfying. The gameplay had a surprising amount of depth to it, and after only a short while I was stumbling my way into cinematic combos: pulling down towers one moment, shooting baddies off my rusty hood the next, and then diving out of the car as the damage it took began to hurt my precious Max man. Outside the vehicle, I shot down one enemy with my last shotgun shell, picked up his wrench to whack another over the head, and then applied a special finishing move to complete the kill in gory fashion. The fluidity of that entire sequence, and the fact I could perform it with negligible training, is what impressed me most about Mad Max. We can (and should) have debates about the proper place of violence in video games, but once you accept that Max's world is a violent and brutal one, you have to credit the game's makers for bringing it to life so ably. Mad Max is the product of Avalanche Studios, the same gang of explosion-loving coders that's responsible for developing the Just Cause series. Open world gaming is this team's specialty, and that's apparent as soon as you inhale your first breath of dry desert air. The game looks great and plays just as well Instead of feeling bland and characterless, the game's full of subtle details that draw you in. Realistic dust swirls are actually an important feature in a game where the primary activity is driving through desert. And unlike slower-paced titles like Fallout, action in Mad Max is never more than a few moments away. You just get into your trusty car, and if you don't find trouble, trouble soon finds you.   Beneath its exaggerated veneer of adrenaline-filled chases and chaotic battles, Mad Max also has a sophisticated customization and upgrade system to entice players into side missions and other loot quests. More powerful engines, fiercer hood ornaments, spiked rims, side-mounted flamethrowers, and various paint jobs and insignia can all be unlocked and purchased through the acquisition of scrap, the de facto currency of the game. Max can also be customized and upgraded, which doesn't make quite as much sense as the vehicular improvements, but whatever, it's a game. One small detail I like is that the healing potion in this game is literally water, which is faithful to both the Mad Max canon and real life. On reflection, I think any attempt to recreate Fury Road as an interactive fiction would have been doomed to fail. The narrative force of the movie would have been lost in the open exploration of a game like Mad Max, so I'm actually relieved that this game has its own, unique take on the wasteland that Max inhabits. Mad Max is full of beautiful, immersive visuals and it has a few original game mechanics that are enough to make it feel fresh and exciting. It has already earned nominations for best PC game and best action game of Gamescom 2015, and on the strength of my experience playing it, I think it's merited both.

But at Gamescom 2015, Square Enix revealed a very different, much more serious trailer that introduces us to the game's backstory. Set 15 years before the events of FFXV, the new trailer showcases a relationship between a father and son, and also provides a nice look at the game's unique fantasy-meets-modern setting. This is a place where automatic guns and luxury cars live alongside swords and gleaming suits of armor. Much of the story still remains a mystery, of course, but it sounds like it will be wonderfully confusing in a way only Final Fantasy can be. Here's how Square Enix describes it: In a matter of days, the Kingdom of Lucis is to sign an armistice, ending a long and bitter conflict with Niflheim. Ahead of the ceremony, Prince Noctis, heir to the Lucian throne, sets forth from his homeland to formalize the union of states through his marriage to the Lady Lunafreya of the imperial province of Tenebrae. The offer of peace, however, is no more than a ruse to lower the Lucian shield, and the imperial army takes the crown city and its sacred crystal in one fell swoop. En route to his destination, Noctis is shocked to learn that he, his father the king, and his betrothed are believed dead. Overnight, the dream of peace has faded into a distant memory. His world crumbling around him, Noctis has naught but his resolve and his loyal companions to see him through the trials to come. FFXV still doesn't have a release date, but it's scheduled to launch on both the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 whenever it does come out. Here's some dramatic concept art to hold you over while you wait.

If you’ve been following our breathless coverage of all things Drake in recent weeks, then you probably know the Toronto rapper closed his sixth annual OVO Fest Monday with a thunderous headlining performance. He brought out a wide array of guests — Kanye West, Pharrell, Future, Skepta, Big Sean, and Travi$ Scott, but who’s counting — and ripped through almost all of his best recent tracks and features, from ""Energy"" to ""Tuesday."" But Monday night’s show isn’t going to be remembered for its slate of surprise cameos, and it’s not going to be remembered for its dense setlist. It’s going to be remembered for Drake’s Philadelphian contemporary, Meek Mill, and the way the festival’s host stomped all over their nascent spat like a high school prom king shoving a teenage pleb into an empty locker. Drake was juvenile, petty, malicious, and undeniably thorough It was that kind of humiliation: juvenile, petty, malicious, but undeniably comprehensive. There’s no need for a roundtable anymore; Drake has emerged from this challenge triumphant. But there are some questions that warrant answers: Why did Drake feel the need to respond with such force? What skills gave him a decisive edge over Meek when it came to capturing the court of public opinion? And what, if anything, did this cost him? A brief recap, for those of you who’ve managed to make it this far without a clue what’s going on: about two weeks ago, Meek lit into Drake on Twitter and accused him of using a ghostwriter, a volatile assertion given the importance hip-hop places on authorial intent. (Meek’s tirade came after Drake failed to promote his new album Dreams Worth More Than Money, which happens to include a Drake feature on the song ""R.I.C.O."") Drake responded with a warped, oblique diss track, ""Charged Up,"" which premiered during his OVO Sound radio show on Beats 1 on July 25th. A few days passed without word from Meek, enough time to Drake to jab again with the pugnacious ""Back to Back"" on July 29th. By the time Meek cobbled together and released ""Wanna Know"" on the night of July 30th, Drake had accrued enough momentum to mute the song’s impact. (It didn’t help that it was terrible.)   That brings us to OVO Fest, where Drake sealed in a decisive victory. He performed ""Charged Up"" and ""Back to Back"" to a sea of adoring fans in front of a slideshow of fan-made Meek Mill memes. He teased a third diss track, ""3Peat,"" that probably doesn’t need to see the light of day unless he wants a victory lap. He wore a ""Free Meek Mill"" T-shirt, a reference to Meek’s prison stint in 2014. He had Kanye and Will Smith (!) howling at a few more Meek jokes backstage. Meek came back with… tooth whitener promotion on Instagram. Drake has been working on sonic and personal calcification Meek’s initial challenge gave Drake an opportunity to put a cap on a sonic and personal calcification project, one he’s been working on ever since releasing Take Care in 2011. That album, his second, was baroque, open, and generous, and it took every criticism levied at Drake to that point — his lack of technical skill, his surface-level introspection, his general corniness — and turned them into strengths. It was confident and even conceited at times, but its confidence didn’t have much to do with Drake’s position relative to his contemporaries. Instead, it was the work of a rising star, one looking back on his relatively humble beginnings and surveying what would become a kingdom. It wasn’t anywhere close to being called ""tough."" Drake’s music began to change after Take Care, and it’s hard to separate the organic developments from the conscious choices. Released two years later, Nothing Was the Same found him hardened by fame and the pressure of sitting at a genre’s vanguard; with a few exceptions, it was colder, more paranoid, more insular. If You’re Reading This It’s Too Late retreated even further into his mind, with icy, hookless composition and the most ferocious, cutting rapping of his career. He was choosing to pursue the darkest parts of his celebrity, and that choice manifested itself in his music. And when Meek decided to come at him, it gave him a chance to reinforce his musical message with some action: mess with me, and you’ll end up a laughingstock.   He was able to push Meek into the realm of online infamy because he understands how the internet works. That sounds flippant, but it’s not: Drake’s grasp of the internet’s speed and language is almost unparalleled among other public figures, let alone rapping contemporaries. He understood the importance of striking quickly after Meek’s initial comments, putting a track together in just a few days — and when Meek failed to deliver a comeback with the same speed, he seized the floor again, rapping with sharpness and good humor. His choice to rap in front of a meme slideshow was laughable considering he rapped ""Fuck goin’ online, that ain’t part of my day"" earlier this year, but it was indicative of his intelligence; it was the best way to harness the sense of public ""participation"" in the feud. And like any veteran troll, he combined diversionary tactics and outsized reaction to great effect. After two full diss tracks, plenty of pithy social media maneuvers, and a whole festival's worth of trolling, Drake still hasn't directly responded to Meek's initial attack. (It's worth noting that Meek brought the receipts, too: ""Wanna Know"" may be terrible, but it's studded with reference tracks Quentin Miller ostensibly recorded for Drake.) His use of Nicki's career and prominence has been distasteful and retrograde Drake may have earned a consensus victory in this little tussle, but a new problem has emerged: he now risks becoming a out-and-out villain, a role he has yet to play. In pursuing flintiness and undertaking a controlled demolition of Meek’s career, he’s had to mortgage the ""nice Drake"" that’s more familiar to fans and onlookers: the genial ESPY host; the SNL star; the finely bearded, eager Wimbledon fan tailing after Serena Williams like a puppy. He needs to be vicious in self-defense, sure — but give it a week, and he’ll be back to posting goofy Instagram videos and rolling lint off of an argyle cardigan at various sporting events. I’m not sure people are going to forget this display so easily: the ad hominem attacks on Meek’s character, success, and especially his girlfriend; the palpable malice; the fact that he’s opting for obliteration when he could’ve dismissed this with a royal wave. (His use of Nicki’s career, her prominence, and their friendship as a base for shots at Meek has been particularly distasteful and retrograde.) If anything’s become clear in the last two weeks, it’s that this whole ordeal has been unnecessary. Drake’s writing is just one piece of his appeal and influence, and there’s enough ambiguity surrounding the ghostwriting accusations for most people to dismiss them. It’s hard to imagine the Drake of five (or even two) years ago coming off this spiteful, this vindictive, this mean. A response like ""Charged Up"" would've sat within the realm of possibility; the addition of ""Back to Back"" and all of his OVO stunting pushed him into new territory. (Based on his choices over that period of time, that might be exactly what he wants to hear.) There may be a few more parting shots from either side, but Drake and Meek’s beef is over — and with it, so is a major transitional phase in Drake’s career. Say goodbye to that Drake from four years ago. All that’s left is learning which Drake comes next.

At IFA today, Toshiba is revealing the Satellite Radius 12 convertible. The name might sound a little boring, but the specifications certainly aren't.

Inside there's Intel's latest Skylake processors up to the Core i7, and up to 8GB of RAM. Toshiba is really pitching this as the ultimate convertible, with a hinge that transforms this ordinary laptop into a tablet very much like Lenovo's Yoga. Elsewhere, Toshiba has also included some more new technologies that make this laptop a little more exciting. Toshiba is joining other manufacturers by including a USB Type-C port on a Windows laptop. While Apple has opted just for the single port on its 12-inch MacBook, Toshiba has also included two regular USB ports and HDMI output.   Hello, Windows Hello Curiously, the Satellite Radius 12 also includes support for Windows Hello. Microsoft's Windows Hello feature is part of Windows 10 and allows users to log into a PC with just their face or fingerprint. Toshiba claims its ""HD webcam"" supports Windows Hello here, and we're waiting for the company to reveal whether it has managed to fit Intel's RealSense camera into this 12.5-inch laptop. It would be one of the smallest implementations on the market if it has, as most existing laptops with Intel's RealSense camera are 15 inches or more. We've asked Toshiba for comment on the exact webcam, but we're waiting to hear back. Either way, Toshiba does claim it has worked closely with Microsoft and Intel to ""include the latest technologies.""

But it's still bulky and dangerous when compared to a smartphone on a selfie stick. Snap, a new drone from Vantage Robotics, has a lot of interesting ideas about how to solve these problems. The prototype we played with is a little rough around the edges, but if it can iron out the kinks before shipping, the Snap could greatly expand the potential audience for aerial robots. Most drones with a good camera and healthy battery life are too large to fit into a backpack, much less your pocket. The Snap promises a stabilized 4K camera and 20 minutes of battery life on a drone that folds up to fit into a small backpack or large purse, hell you could probably squeeze them into the pockets on a pair of roomy cargo shorts. You connect the fuselage to the rotors and battery by pressing together magnetic strips, locking them into place with a satisfying snap that lends the unit its name.   Fits together with a satisfying click Most drones this size forgo an external camera mount. That makes them light and portable, for example the Parrot Bebop. But it also means they typically lack a three-axis gimbal, and so cannot produce footage that is quite as stable and smooth while flying. The Snap solves this problem with a tiny gimbal and camera that are housed inside the body of the drone. In our testing, it produced clean, stable footage, although not quite as smooth or high quality as what you find on a DJI Phantom 3, which is roughly equal in price. All the great design comes from co-founders Tobin Fisher and Joe van Niekerk, who serve as CEO and CTO, respectively. Fisher worked at IDEO, where he learned a great deal about how to make high tech products more accessible to the average consumer. Niekerk was a winner of the DARPA Grand Challenge in robotics and designed high-end gimbals for military drones. The duo assembled a team of Stanford-trained engineers and designers to help them create Snap. The best rotor guards I've seen yet The detachable rotors on Snap aren't just interesting for their space-saving design. They have also borrowed from bicycle wheels and bridge builders to craft a set of spokes which cover 90 percent of the spinning blades. A lot of drones come with optional rotor guards, but they are typically made of pretty flimsy plastic and don't afford a lot of extra protection. With the Snap, I felt safe not just catching and pushing the drone with my hands, but playfully headbutting it.   The unique design also means that the Snap you purchase is relatively easy to modify. The initial model is meant for portability and can sustain decent, 20-minute flights. But using the same fuselage and battery, Vantage has designed a set of much larger rotors that enable a near silent, one-hour flight, perfect for hovering over your kid's soccer game and capturing the action. Breaks apart on impact to keep all the parts intact There is an additional benefit to the magnetic design. Just like most people will at some point drop their smartphone, most people will at some point crash their drone. The Snap is built to break apart on impact, dispersing the impact. Of course, during our testing, the reason that unit crashed was that one of the magnetic strips came loose, causing the battery to detach in midair. Vantage says the final unit will affix the magnets inside the body, meaning it should be more robust than the 3D-printed prototype which relies on superglue. You can preorder the Snap today for $895, and Vantage expects to retail the unit for $1,295 in the spring of 2016. If they can iron out the kinks so the final unit is robust and reliable, the innovative form factor of the Snap will make it a very attractive new offering. Either way, its approach certainly highlights the kind of innovations that will help to mainstream the drone market in the coming year or two.",0.7734062394287663,0.2265937605712337,0.15354191359318112,700,4.6728571428571426,393,5.6768447837150129,0,4,"Tech, Report"

The ""Predator"" series encompasses Windows 10 laptops and desktop PCs, monitors, an Android tablet, and potentially smartphones or projectors in the future. Not only do we know the general specifications of these very powerful, extremely silly-looking machines, we know they'll be coming this fall. Acer's line was designed for ""serious gamers, members of what we call the Predator Tribe,"" because there's no point in buying a gaming device if the purchase doesn't double as some kind of nerd gang initiation ritual (hopefully the Predator Tribe's turf doesn't overlap with my own Republic of Gamers, because it already stole our colors). Based on the massive ""armor-covered"" G6 desktop whose availability was announced at Gamescom last month, it may double as a Decepticon smuggling operation.

They're equipped with Intel's new Skylake Core i7 processor, and ""select models"" include up to 32GB of memory and a high-end Nvidia GeForce GTX 980 graphics card. They've got, respectively, 15.6-inch and 17.3-inch screens, although only the Predator 15 includes the option to use a 4K screen instead of a standard high-definition one. And they've got support for USB Type-C, the next-generation connectivity tech that's just starting to roll out to computers. Acer Predator gaming press photosPreviousNextView full GalleryPreviousNext Any high-end laptop can fairly count as a gaming PC, but there are a few extras that make much more sense in that context. The laptops will let users swap out their optical drive for a third cooling fan, helping players get through particularly intense gaming sessions. They also offer all sorts of minute customization options, including fine fan control, a keyboard with different zones whose lights can be adjusted independently, and a networking option that will send data over ethernet and Wi-Fi simultaneously (although we're not sure how much this will help performance). Acer takes on the Nvidia Shield with a haptic tablet The most intriguing part of the line so far is the Predator 8, a very slender aluminum-shelled gaming tablet along the lines of Nvidia's Shield Tablet. The Android 5.1 tablet has an 8-inch HD display that can be used with an optional stylus, up to 64GB of storage with an additional microSD card slot, an Intel Atom x7 processor, and what Acer promises are four powerful front-facing speakers. More unusually, it can provide haptic feedback with ""a real sense of vibration"" — something Acer suggests could come to a smartphone in the future as well. Besides these, there are some new monitors: the curved 35-inch Predator Z35, with a 2560 x 1080 screen, and the flat XB1 series, which includes a 28-inch 4K model and a 27-inch model that comes in 4K and 2560 x 1440 flavors. Acer is emphasizing clarity and fast refresh rates, both advantageous in the twitch-reflex world of gaming. The Z35 is coming to Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and North America in December, starting at $1,199 in the US. The XB1 series will come out in October in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, and in November for North America, starting at $799.

Imagine having a vertical tower of Lego pieces, only with every piece you add, the tower gains a new ability.  Blocks include speakers, a projector, and a wireless charging dock Acer calls these add-ons ""blocks.""

It includes either an Intel Celeron or Pentium processor, so this isn't going to be a particularly capable machine no matter how you upgrade it. It maxes out at 8GB of RAM, and it isn't stated how powerful that graphics block is going to be. That base also includes three USB 3.0 ports, an HDMI port, a DisplayPort, an SD card reader, and a headphone / microphone jack. Acer isn't the first to come up with the idea of a modular PC, but it might have the first high-profile, consumer-focused one to market. Razer announced similar ambitions with a concept called Project Christine, but it isn't clear if it's going anywhere yet. However, the Revo Build Series' first core unit, the M1-601, will go on sale starting this October. It'll initially be available in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, with prices starting at €199; then in December, it'll arrive in China with prices beginning at ¥1,999. It's supposed to head to the US eventually, too. Acer seems to suggest that more powerful core blocks could arrive in the future, but this machine seems to be designed for emerging markets where an affordable and easily upgradable computer could take off. A bunch of laptops and an all-in-one are being announced today, too In addition to the Revo Build Series, Acer is introducing one other desktop PC and a number of laptops and convertibles. Called the Aspire U5-710, the desktop is a 23.8-inch all-in-one with a 1080p touchscreen display, a Core i5 or i7 processor, and up to 16GB of RAM. It's a pretty nice looking, vaguely futuristic machine, although it doesn't appear to be nearly as slim or be built nearly as well as the iMac. It'll also include a RealSense 3D camera. The Aspire U5-710 will go on sale in October for €999, and it too doesn't have a North American launch date yet. Several Acer laptops are headed for North America soon, however. Acer's lineup of Windows 10 machines is toplined by the Aspire V Nitro series, which includes 15-inch and 17-inch models. Both sizes have a baseline 1366 x 768 resolution and some type of Core i5 processor from Intel's new Skylake line, but they can be upgraded to become far more powerful. They top out with specs like an Ultra HD display, a Core i7 processor, 32GB of RAM, a GeForce graphics card, and a RealSense camera.

For one, the V Nitro series includes a USB Type-C port, which isn't too useful at the moment but is quickly taking off. On a more powerful version of the laptops, which are being called the Black Editions, those ports also support the Thunderbolt 3 standard, so they can be used to transfer data at speeds up to 40Gbps. All models in the V Nitro series will also include 2x2 802.11ac Wi-Fi with multiuser MIMO — a tech that allows it to more efficiently transfer data — all of which should allow it to transfer data at up to three times the speeds of earlier products with 802.11ac, according to Acer.

It can be upgraded to include a 1080p touchscreen and 16GB of RAM. It also includes a USB Type-C port and 802.11ac Wi-Fi with multiuser MIMO. The laptop is supposed to get up to 8 hours of battery life, whereas the more powerful models are between 5 hours and 8 hours. This model sells for much cheaper, beginning at $599. The V Nitro series begins at $999 for the 15-inch model and at $1,099 for the 17-inch model. All three will be available in North America beginning this October. In addition to its Aspire V laptops, Acer is introducing several new Windows 10 machines with more interesting form factors.

Additionally, there's the Aspire Switch 10 V and 10 E, two convertible Windows 10 machines that can work as a laptop or break free from their keyboard to become a tablet. These are low-power systems with 10-inch displays, Atom processors, and 2GB of RAM. The R 13 will go on sale in October for $899, but Acer gave no pricing or availability for the Switch line.

Using an iPhone's camera plugged into a 3D-printed microscope base, doctors can now test a blood sample for the presence of the parasitic worm Loa loa within minutes, according to a study published in Science Translational Medicine. This process typically demands lab equipment and over a day to complete, but the new CellScope Loa reduces both requirements by being portable, fast, and automated. Loa loa has proven a major stumbling block for the treatment of two other parasitic diseases: river blindness and elephantiasis. Though drug treatment programs were initiated to help treat those infections in Central Africa — where they are most prevalent — those programs were halted because Loa loa infection led to serious side effects. People infected with Loa loa and receiving drugs for river blindness and elephantiasis suffered brain damage; some died. Being able to quickly and reliably test for Loa loa may be key in resuming the treatment programs to help fight other parasitic diseases. There's now an app, and a 3D-printed microscope, for saving lives The CellScope Loa is the product of collaboration between scientists at the University of California-Berkeley, and the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. It works by capturing video of a blood sample and looking for the characteristic ""wriggling"" motion of Loa loa microfilaria. Motion detection simplifies things dramatically, as the blood doesn't require any special preparation before being tested, and an associated iPhone app reduces the rate of human error by automating the entire process. Once the health care worker activates the scan, their iPhone uses a Bluetooth connection to control gears inside the base of the scope, moving the sample in front of the camera. An algorithm then analyzes the footage and provides a worm count. All within the space of a couple of minutes. The researchers are confident in the accuracy of their new system, which they claim has a false-negative error rate as low as one in 10 million. That's the more important type of error to reduce, given that the goal is to ""test and not treat"" patients who have Loa loa infections; they're looking to ascertain that people won't suffer damaging side effects when receiving treatment for river blindness or elephantiasis. An initial field test on 33 potentially Loa loa-infected subjects in Cameroon has shown the CellScope producing comparable results to those obtained in a lab. There were no false negatives and only two false positives. With such encouraging early results, the study is now being expanded to about 40,000 people in the country. ""The availability of a point-of-care test prior to drug treatment is a major advance in the control of these debilitating diseases,"" says Berkeley ecologist Vincent Resh, who isn't part of the research team but has worked on the control of river blindness in West Africa for 15 years.

Today in Applied Physics Letters, researchers from National Taiwan University unveiled a new artificial muscle design, made by layering gold on top of the skin of an onion. It's a new tactic in the search for a working artificial muscle, a search that could have important implications for robotics and healthcare in the years to come. Because of the onion's unique cell structure, the new artificial muscle is able to remain soft and bendable while it's contracting, a trick that has eluded previous artificial muscle design. The researchers had been attempting to make a similar structure out of polymers when they realized the onion provided a cheaper natural alternative. ""Like human muscles, it can bend and contract simultaneously,"" said Wen-Pin Shih, a mechanical engineer who worked on the project. ""That's something previous models couldn't do."" The muscle is built on the epidermis of the onion, the filmy layer underneath the outer shell. Like real muscles, that film is both stretchy and responsive to electricity, thanks to the single-layered lattice structure of its cells. Still, getting the film to work as a muscle took a lot of preparation. The team freeze-dried the skin to remove internal water and dipped it in dilute sulfuric acid to make the skin more elastic. Then the onion skin was dipped in two layers of gold and an electrode was attached.  A diagram of the study's onion tweezers. The result is a working machine built on top of the onion's basic properties. The upper portions of the skin expand under low voltages, bending the muscle downward, but contract under higher voltages, curving the muscle upward. The team even used it to pick up a tiny ball of cotton, combining two muscles for a pair of onion tweezers. The muscles are still only strong enough to pick up about 2 milligrams at a time, but Shih says the next step is strengthening the muscle and lowering the voltage. Along the way, he hopes to discover more about the cellular structure that allows the muscle to stay elastic while contracting. ""We still don't fully understand the structure of the cell walls and its associated properties,"" Shih says. ""We're just reporting what we have so far to exchange ideas."" If the new muscle becomes viable for production, it could be a valuable tool for the emerging world of soft robotics, which focuses on squishy bots that can be set loose without damaging their surroundings. Currently, the bots are limited to simple motor functions like contracting, expanding, and rotating, but robotics experts hope that artificial muscle technology might one day combine all three of those functions into a single all-purpose muscle.

The results are encouraging, as many malaria vaccines that work well in the lab have failed to show the same efficacy in the field. But low malaria infection rates in the region at the time of the study are putting a damper on the results. Whether the vaccine would work well in regions with lots of malaria is unclear The vaccine ""shows promise,"" says Philip Bejon, an infectious disease researcher at the University of Oxford and a co-author of the study. But we can't know if the vaccine would perform as well in areas where the risk for malaria is high, he says. Increased bed net use and mosquito control measures have helped reduce the number of malaria infections by 47 percent since 2000, but a lot of people around the world are still affected by this potentially deadly disease. There were about 198 million malaria cases in 2013, and approximately 584,000 malaria-related deaths, according to the World Health Organization. That's why developing a vaccine that can protect people against malaria — or the parasite that causes the disease — remains vital. In the study, researchers recruited 121 healthy adult Kenyan men. Half of them received the malaria vaccine, while the other half received a control rabies vaccine. All the participants were also given antimalarial drugs to clear any previous infections that could have confused the results. Then, the researchers monitored the men for eight weeks. The vaccine used by the researchers was made from two different viruses that were genetically tailored to produce a protein found on the surface of the malaria parasite. Using two viruses allows for a ""prime-boost strategy."" When the vaccine is introduced into the body, the first virus ""primes"" the immune cells by exposing them to the malaria protein. Then, the second virus — the ""booster"" — strengthens the immunity that's being developed by re-stimulating the immune system. Blood tests showed that the men built up a strong immune response The researchers found that the vaccine was safe overall. Blood tests showed that the men built up a strong immune response against infection. In addition, the vaccine provided partial protection — it was 67 percent effective — against infection with the malaria parasite for at least two weeks following vaccination. But because of weather-related fluctuations, the transmission rate of malaria was ""much lower than expected"" during the study period, the researchers note. ""All the malaria was outside the monitoring period that we planned for the study,"" Bejon says. It's possible that the vaccine would have worked just as well when confronted with a higher malaria risk. But, it's also possible that it would have been a total flop. ""It might be harder to overcome more frequent inoculations of malaria from mosquitoes,"" he says. This adds an extra layer of difficulty for researchers trying to determine if the vaccine works. The researchers ""consistently demonstrated vaccine efficacy at eight weeks,"" says Matthew Laurens, a malaria researcher at the University of Maryland who didn't participate in this study. ""But this is a brief period for efficacy evaluation"" in an area where malaria is found regularly. The WHO Malaria Vaccine Technology Roadmap, for instance, targets vaccine efficacy of 75 percent over a period of two years, Laurens notes. And similar early trials looked at efficacy over a number of months.  Ideally, the researchers would have to show that the vaccine works beyond the eight-week period, during a time when study participants would be more at risk for infection, he says. ""This may increase enthusiasm for [this] vaccine approach."" ""The target population for protection are children."" In response, Bejon explains that the short trial period was meant to show that there is ""a faster way of testing vaccine efficacy in the field"" before doing larger, more expensive trials. ""The larger and more expensive a trial is, the slower it is to set up and run,"" he says. A smaller trial such as this one can yield valuable results before moving on to something bigger. Now that the study is complete, Bejon and his team would like to test the vaccine in other populations — including in kids. ""The target population for protection are children,"" he says; a study involving kids ""would often require several more months follow-up.""",0.505109544106249,0.494890455893751,0.8570481074331283,744,5.146505376344086,372,6.190860215053763,0,0,"Science, Report"

The findings of the study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, add to growing concerns over the public health risks involved with fracking, which uses water, sand, and chemicals to release shale gas from rocks deep below Earth's surface. ""This is the first documented and published demonstration of toxic compounds escaping from uncased boreholes in shale gas wells and moving long distances"" into drinking water, Susan Brantley, a geoscientist at Pennsylvania State University and one of the study's authors, told the Associated Press. Contamination blamed on poorly built wells Analysis of drinking water gathered from the homes revealed small amounts of 2-Butoxyethanol or 2-BE, a compound commonly found in cosmetics and household cleaners. 2-BE has been shown to cause tumors in rodents, though its effects on humans remain less clear, and researchers say the amounts discovered in Pennsylvania were within regulatory limits. The authors note that the contamination was likely not caused by fracking itself, but by poorly constructed drill wells. The three homes are located in Bradford County, Pennsylvania, near gas wells built in 2009 over the Marcellus Shale formation. High levels of methane and sediment were found in their drinking water in 2010, prompting a lawsuit against the drilling company, Chesapeake Energy Corporation. State regulators levied a $1 million fine against the company in 2011, and enacted tougher regulations for drilling. New York and Vermont have banned fracking altogether amid concerns over public health and the environment. Last month, the Obama administration introduced new regulations that require companies to disclose the chemicals used when drilling for gas and oil. The industry pushes back   The study's authors believe the contamination occurred in 2010, before Pennsylvania's drilling regulations went into effect, and acknowledge that the stricter rules could have prevented it. Experts not involved in the study said it demonstrates a clear (if rare) example of drilling's impact on drinking water, but representatives from the drilling industry called the findings into question. Shale gas advocates have long argued that drilling occurs too far below underground freshwater to pose any threat to human health. ""The entire case is based around the detection of an exceedingly small amount of a compound that’s commonly used in hundreds of household products,"" Katie Brown, a consultant for the petroleum advocacy group Energy in Depth, said in an email to The New York Times.

The new bird has been named Archaeornithura meemannae. Feathers cover almost the entirety of its body, including its head, neck, shoulders, and wings, though the bird's legs and feet are bare. The bare legs suggest that Archaeornithura — or its ancestors — came from a semi-aquatic environment where it was used to wading. The finding is being published today in Nature Communications.  ""It gives us crucial new information on their origins and early evolution."" ""The new fossil bird Archaeornithura is an important find,"" Matthew Lamanna, an assistant curator at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History who was not involved in the study, writes in an email to The Verge. If it’s been dated correctly, Lamanna says, Archaeornithura pushes back the fossil record of birds’ most recent ancestors by 5 million to 6 million years. The group behind the study, which was led by a researcher from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, located the two fossils in the Sichakou basin in Hebei, a province in northeast China. This is part of the second-oldest formation in the world that's been found to carry bird fossils, but only a small number of distinct samples have actually been found there. Discoveries like Archaeornithura help researchers to define the transition between dinosaurs, primitive ancestors of birds, and the birds that we see today. Some ""extraordinary"" fossils have made the transition between dinosaurs and primitive birds ""fairly well understood,"" Lamanna says, ""but the transition from these primitive birds to the species we see flying around us today is much less known."" As the oldest known member of the modern bird group, Archaeornithura is a key find toward allowing researchers to figure that out. ""It gives us crucial new information on their origins and early evolution,"" Lamanna says. There are likely older birds waiting to be found Archaeornithura stands out for having advanced features that are similar to modern birds while still having primitive traits. Min Wang, the study's lead author, says that Archaeornithura can be considered to ""have many morphological features of modern birds,"" at least when you compare it to other birds living around 130 million years ago. But it still has some major differences, he says, such as the claws on its hands. Wang also suspects that future excavations will push the timeline for this modern bird group, Ornithuromorpha, back even further. Between the evolutionary timeline researchers are already seeing and the geological structure of the formation where Archaeornithura was found, there's an indication ""that there are specimens older than the new specimen,"" Wang tells The Verge in an email.

The new human embryonic stem cells were injected into mouse embryos in the lab, leading to different early-stage tissues after 36 hours, according to the paper published in Nature. That’s in contrast to two types of conventionally used human stem cells, which didn’t develop when injected into the non-viable mouse embryos. Today’s new kind of stem cell may allow scientists to better study developmental disorders at their earliest stages and ""has huge implications for regenerative medicine,"" says study author Juan Carlos Izpisua Belmonte. With improvements in the technology, it may be possible to generate human cells, tissues, and organs in another species, like a pig — which can then be used for transplant, he says. ""Of course, the ethical implications behind creating a human-animal chimera for the purpose of obtaining human tissues and organs to save lives of millions need to be carefully evaluated."" This isn’t the first time that human cells have been integrated into a mouse embryo. In 2006, scientists injected human embryonic stem cells into a non-viable mouse embryo and let the cells develop for a few days; the human cells contributed a little. Another similar experiment was published by Nature in 2013, also showing some human cell contributions. But today’s paper is the only one that determined that the human cells created the three germ layers of cells — suggesting that these cells can produce all types of cells in the body. For the last several years, scientists have recognized that different kinds of pluripotent stem cells — the ones that produce all the body’s cell types — exist. In living creatures, these pluripotent states don’t last long; they’re only around in the earliest stages of development. ""The kick for me was the human data.""""At first, I looked at this like okay, fine, we have a new pluripotent state,"" says Kathrin Plath, an associate professor at UCLA’s Broad Center of Regenerative Medicine and Stem Cell Research. She wasn’t involved in the research. ""But when I got to the primate data, that was what made me excited about the paper. The kick for me was the human data."" Previously scientists have derived pluripotent stem cells from structures containing clustered cells that eventually become the embryo, called blastocysts, or early post-implantation embryos. These lineages need to be cultured in the lab dissimilarly, show different molecular characteristics and behave distinctly when they’re injected back into host blastocysts. Mouse chimeras have been crucial for exploring how genes work in the body One puzzling thing about these cells has been that mouse and human embryonic stem cells behave very differently, even though they’re derived from a stage in development that seems to be ""reasonably equivalent,"" says Uta Grieshammer, the science officer at the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine. That may be because those states aren’t really that similar, she says. Mouse embryonic stem cells are considered ""naive,"" meaning that when they’re injected into a blastocyst that can’t make embryonic tissue, a whole mouse results. Mice made using this technique are called chimeras; they contain cell types from genetically distinct cells. (Chimeras occur naturally as well; if you have a friend with different-colored eyes, you know a chimera — that person was twins who merged in the womb.)   Mouse embryonic stem cells (the clump in the middle) surrounded by feeder cells (Joseph Elsbernd)  Mouse chimeras have been crucial for exploring how specific genes work in the body. Scientists insert bits of DNA in mouse embryonic stem cells to create ""knockout mice,"" mice who lack a specific gene or set of genes. That enabled better modeling of human disease in mice, leading to medical breakthroughs. In 2007, a team of researchers won the Nobel Prize for pioneering the knockout mouse. Human embryonic stem cells aren't as flexible as mouse cells But human embryonic stem cells aren’t as flexible as mouse cells, and the technique likely wouldn’t work in people. Genetic testing of human embryonic stem cells suggests they resemble stem cells derived from later-stage mouse embryos, called epiblast stem cells, Grieshammer says. ""It’s not perfect, and there are some exceptions, but that’s the general feeling in the field,"" she says. Studies in other primates suggest that the problem isn’t limited to human stem cells. In 2012, a group of researchers from Oregon Health and Science University found it was impossible to create chimeric monkeys by injecting embryonic stem cells into a host embryo. We’re much more closely related to monkeys than mice, so that study may mean that stem cells can’t contribute to monkey chimeras because the cells are already too advanced. In 2010, researchers created a mouse with a rat pancreas So far, studies of human-mouse chimeras have only looked into a few days’ worth of development. But the new pluripotent state may aid more radical approaches in creating chimeras, Grieshammer says. In 2010, researchers created a mouse with a rat pancreas. They used knockout technology to prevent the mouse from creating its own pancreas, and injected the embryo with rat stem cells instead, which generated the organ. The structure of the pancreas created with this method was part rat and part mouse, the researchers found. It’s possible to imagine chimeric animals, like pigs, that could harbor human organs for use in transplant. But that’s far in the future, Grieshammer and Izpisua Belmonte say. In the nearer term, being able to more readily culture human embryonic cell types in the lab may make research on diseases of early development easier, UCLA’s Plath says. For instance, there’s a type of autism called Rett syndrome, which occurs only in women. It’s due to a mutation on the X chromosome; male embryos, which have only one X chromosome, are lost early in development. ""It’s hard to study this because it’s hard to capture those male embryos,"" Plath says. Female embryos make it farther — to birth, in fact — since the second, normal X chromosome confers protection from the mutation’s effects. Being able to culture human embryonic stem cells more easily and embed them in other embryos ""just opens up more possibilities we can pursue,"" Plath says. ""And on top of the more practical things, this could get us a better understanding of the early development that gets us all these cell types.""",0.5720279050591864,0.42797209494081356,0.8574727438663308,1083,5.2188365650969528,499,6.3727454909819636,0,2,"Science, Report"

As first reported by French daily Le Parisien, the unnamed driver is due to appear before a judge on May 29th and, if convicted, could face up to five years in prison and a fine of €75,000 ($82,000). Uber has come under increased scrutiny for its safety record in recent months, after one of its chauffeurs in India was arrested on charges of raping a female passenger late last year. The taxi-hailing company is also in the middle of an ongoing legal battle in France over its UberPop service, which has been deemed illegal under regulations that went into effect at the beginning of this year. Last week, 25 police officers raided Uber's Paris offices as part of an investigation into the service. Driver was ""immediately suspended"" According to Le Parisien, the alleged assault occurred on January 17th, when the accused chauffeur drove a young woman and two of her friends to the Show Case nightclub along the Seine River. According to a complaint filed with the police, the driver dropped off the two friends near the nightclub, but drove a little farther before letting the woman out because she was seated in the front passenger seat and was not curbside. It was there, according to the woman, that he ordered her to perform oral sex. A dispute ensued and the woman filed charges, but the driver has denied any wrongdoing. In a telephone interview, Thomas Meister, spokesman for Uber France, said the driver was ""immediately suspended"" when Uber was notified of the incident in January and that the company ""is offering full cooperation to the police."" Meister added that the driver went through a background check prior to joining Uber. Le Parisien reported that he had been previously arrested for driving without a license, but Meister says such minor offenses are not mentioned in background checks, under French privacy protection laws. Uber has sought to strengthen its safety measures following the alleged rape in Delhi last year. In December, the company announced plans to use biometric scanning to enhance background checks, after cities in California sued it for misleading customers.

(NASA is careful to say that the research performed will be observational in nature, because Mark Kelly's environment and living habits will not closely mimic Scott's.) NASA hopes to use the mission to learn more about things like intracranial pressure (swelling of the brain) in microgravity, the effects of isolation on the body's overall health and performance, the body's response to radiation exposure, bone and muscle loss, changes in the sensorimotor system, and changes to nutritional status. Scott Kelly will return with a record 522 total days in space This isn't Kelly's first trip off-planet; he's already spent almost 200 days aboard the space station across a number of missions. When he returns next year, his 522 total days spent in space will break the US record previously held by astronaut Mike Fincke. That kind of time spent away from our world takes more than a physical toll, and Kelly spoke to Esquire in December about the mental challenges of being in space for just six months at a time. If you want to keep up with Scott Kelly throughout the year-long adventure, he can be found on most major social media. Twitter has become a popular tool for the astronauts aboard the ISS (where he can be found at @StationCDRKelly), he conveniently joined Vine last night, and President Barack Obama basically demanded that Kelly use Instagram during this year's State of the Union.

I chatted with him briefly on the phone this week to get the dirt.  Chris Ziegler: What was the breakdown between practical effects and CGI in this film? In your estimation, is it up or down from previous movies in the series? Dennis McCarthy: You know, I really feel that in Furious 7 there’s less CGI. [You think] ""My God, that’s impossible,"" but the amazing thing is that a lot of it actually is possible, you know, in real life. So I would say that there’s less CGI in Furious 7 than the previous ones.   How do you decide when to shoot something and when to render it? What does that conversation look like? That’s really a decision that’s not mine to make, but I can just tell you what is behind the filmmakers on it. Basically, with these movies, you want to do as much as you can for real, because I think that makes a difference. It can look the same — sometimes it can’t, sometimes it can — but even if it did look the same on the screen, I think what makes the movie a better film is doing the gag for real. I got a bunch of phone calls when the trailer came out. Everyone was calling me, ""Hey man, did they really drive cars out of planes?"" But the answer was yes! And people were just shocked to believe that. But that sequence happened over the Arizona desert with a C-130 and five cars — actually we had doubles of each, so we had 10 cars, and I think each car made either two or three drops out of that plane. You know, you see the trailer, you watch the Lykan HyperSport go from building to building… yeah, obviously we couldn’t launch a car out of a building in Abu Dhabi, but the sets were as close to real as possible, the car was real, the jumps were real, the breaking glass was real, the stunt personnel scattering out of the way as the car slides through — you know, through the floor, all the real deal. So I think that it’s important fans realize there’s a lot more reality to these movies than one might expect. ""We actually can’t put Vin in the car and fly him through the air."" Were there any requests that came in that you just absolutely could not handle as a practical effect? Did James [Wan] or anyone else on staff say, ""Can we do this?"" and you just said no, that’s not possible? No. I mean, there’s always a couple incidents that are just not possible. But the question never really comes to me, because I think as that stuff is being developed, I think it’s pretty obvious, ""Okay, that’s something that we actually can’t put Vin in the car and fly him through the air."" So, no, for the most part, if we can do real, we will, and like I said, it’s always my goal to keep as much reality in the film as possible, because as a guy that loves car movies myself, that’s what I look for. If you’re trying to do as much of this stuff in reality instead of in CGI as possible, you’re probably damaging and destroying some pretty expensive cars. What’s the most expensive car that you’ve had to destroy on set? Well, I would say in this film, probably the most expensive car to build would’ve been the off-road Charger that you see Dom back out of that airplane. As far as on-screen, visually, it’d be the Lykan HyperSport. Though the cars that we had in the film weren’t the actual production model Lykan HyperSport, they’re basically a movie version that W Motors created for us or built for us. Still very pricey, but not $3.4 million like the actual car would cost. So that’s a different chassis and then a body on top that’s designed to look like the real car, I would assume? That’s absolutely correct. What W Motors did is they used the exact same molds they use for their actual production car, but they built the car out of fiberglass as opposed to carbon fiber. The chassis, instead of being basically a Porsche race car, is a Porsche Boxster with the wheelbase stretched on it. So yeah, we basically built a car that looks 100 percent correct, or is as close to it as we possibly can, and doesn’t wipe my budget out with just one vehicle. Do you ever run into any brand licensing issues with cars? Say if you destroy a particular car on set, has an automaker come to you and said, hey, we’d rather you not do that? No, not at all. That’s something that’s really taken care of from a whole different department. There is a licensing clearance department, and when these choices come up, there is someone that deals with that. But luckily, it’s not me.   Who’s the best driver in the cast? And for that matter, how much driving does the cast actually get to do? The cast does quite a bit of driving, but it’s not the extreme stuff. They’re not jumping the cars, they’re not power-sliding the cars — they’re doing all the drive-up stuff. The reason being isn’t due to lack of skill, it’s lack of time. So we have to have two units going at all times — so if there’s a sequence where you’re not going to see the driver of the car, there’s no reason to waste Vin Diesel’s or Michelle’s time behind the wheel of that car. They can be somewhere else, maybe even in a different country filming a different part of the film. Really, the only cast members that I’ve seen really push the limits would’ve been Paul [Walker] and Vin Diesel. Vin Diesel can slide a car and put it on its mark every time without a problem. I know that they would all prefer to do more driving, but like I said, it would double our production time. So this is not your first Fast & Furious film, right? This is my fifth one. Three, Four, Five, Six, and now Seven. Which has been your favorite to shoot? You know, I would have to say Furious 7. They’re getting better every time. Every movie we do, we try to raise that bar and increase the action and increase the number of cars and, you know, this one really jumped it up a couple of levels. How did you get into this? What’s your background? My background is just building cars. I’ve been into cars since an early age. I think when I was 16 years old, I worked at a speed shop. When I was in my early 20s, I opened my own business building cars. And like I said, it was just one of those things, built a couple different cars for a couple different films, and that led to what I’m doing now. Would you say this is the most interesting car-focused movie franchise in history? Absolutely. There’s really nothing else that comes close to it. To have done seven movies, and they’re all — every one is more successful than the last — just says a lot about what Fast & Furious is about. ""It’s not very exciting to even tell you this, but I drive a Chevy Suburban."" As a car person, what’s your personal daily driver? What do you take to and from the film sets? You know, I have a lot of vehicles, and this is almost… it’s not very exciting to even tell you this, but I drive a Chevy Suburban. One, I have four kids, so it comes in handy, and two, I’m always driving a bunch of my guys back and forth on set. So it’s a very practical vehicle, but I do have a lot of other things that I drive when I’m just out having a good time. Do you think that we’re at the point where we can start [putting hybrid and electric vehicles in the franchise]? I think we are. I mean, it came close on this one. Prior to the Lykan HyperSport, I wanted the LaFerrari which is a hybrid car, and I was just unable to get it. That was my first choice prior to knowing about the Lykan HyperSport. Once I got that background, script-wise, it actually is a much better fit. But no, I think that’s coming. Like you stated, these cars have made leaps and bounds in the last five years and the performance is amazing. So you know, we’ll see. If Fast 8 happens and I get a script and there’s a spot for it, I’m going to try to get that in there.",0.4269045665859903,0.5730954334140097,0.16517883597883612,1596,4.3709273182957391,637,5.615384615384615,1,4,"Culture, Entertainment, Transportation, Interview"

And when Kelly lands in March of next year, he will have spent a total of 522 days in space throughout his career — a new NASA record. Padalka will break the all-time record for total time spent in space The world (or, more accurately, off-world) record for total days in space is is held by Sergei Krikalev, who has spent more than 800 in orbit over the course of six different missions.

The year-long stay will be a first on the ISS, but four other cosmonauts have completed off-planet missions lasting longer than a year; those took place in the 1980s and 1990s aboard the Mir space station.

Instead, an uncrewed spacecraft will travel to one of three candidate asteroids in 2020. When the craft arrives in 2022, it will use robotic arms to pick and secure a small boulder from the asteroid, and will spend a number of years towing the boulder into a stable orbit between the Earth and the Moon. Humans will visit the boulder in 2025 The space agency plans to send a team of astronauts to study the boulder in 2025 using the Orion capsule, the same spacecraft that should eventually bring the first humans to Mars. They will also be tasked with returning samples to Earth. Asteroids are rocky and full of precious metals, which means they can teach us a lot about the formation of our solar system, as well as provide material value. The three being considered — Itokawa, Bennu, and 2008 EV5 — have all been closely studied or even visited by other spacecraft, so the mission should be less risky than sending a probe to explore a comet that's a half-billion miles away.   The mission plan NASA discarded involved the much greater task of ""lassoing"" an entire asteroid. The jettisoned mission required a bigger spacecraft and more moving parts — specifically an inflatable module to surround and seal the space rock inside before towing it to a similar spot. The challenges NASA faces in executing a mission like this will help us develop important skills that could one day be useful in a trip to Mars, according to the agency. Despite that inspirational claim, ARM has had somewhat of a tumultuous history. Vox's Joseph Stromberg points out that the mission was originally proposed in part to give the Space Launch System (NASA's next giant rocket meant to bring humans to space) something to do in the time between its creation and potential missions to the Moon or Mars — not the most inspiring start. ARM has also been a target of House Republicans both on the floor and in op-ed pages because many would rather see NASA return to the Moon instead. As a result of that either/or argument, ARM has not received any specific budgeting. Considering that the agency won't make a final asteroid selection until 2019, even this version of ARM is a long way from being rock solid.",0.3705804865618645,0.6294195134381355,0.7291593081591667,407,4.7420147420147423,256,5.68359375,0,0,"Science, Transportation"

But Milan-based coachbuilder Carrozzeria Touring has teamed up with Mini's design team to build a truly spectacular one-off, electric-powered concept roadster that somehow manages to meld the classic British design with sleek Italian looks. The so-called Mini Touring Superleggera Vision will almost certainly never see the roads in this form, but that doesn't mean you can't fall in love with the design.       The concept is built in the patented superleggera style — Italian for ""superlight."" A lightweight steel tube frame is covered with hand-pounded sheets of aluminum for an ultra-light design. The front of the concept holds most of the Mini design legacy — a large grille and perky, circular headlights are evocative of Minis of old.   Despite that big, classic Mini grille, this concept is an EV. But it's clear from just about any other angle that this is a very different Mini. Like most true superleggeras, the rear extends far back. And there's a wild ’50s-style fin on the boot that manages to work together with the half-retro, half-futuristic design. Perhaps the most distinctive feature are the LED taillights, which — yes — are a split Union Jack.  The taillights aren't nearly as kitschy as one might expect — they're so deftly executed that the rear looks as classic as an Aston Martin. Superleggeras are all about saving weight. As Louis de Fabribeckers, Head of Design at Carrozzeria Touring says, ""In this car all unnecessary equipment or decoration is sacrificed, as performance is gained through lightness and efficiency of the bodywork and interior."" The design employs massive, hand-pounded sheets of aluminum that are placed onto a lightweight tubular steel frame. Minimal Italian design dominates the interior — the dash is one single piece of unpainted aluminum. Though the designers couldn't help but bring back Mini's classic circular center dial.  The three-spoke steering wheel is far more elegant than those found on a typical Mini.  Carrozzeria Touring and BMW-owned Mini revealed the stunning concept this weekend at Concours d'Elegance at Italy's idyllic Villa d'Este near Rome. While a handmade beauty like this will never see production, we hope Mini makes good use of those truly wonderful taillights in a production car.

Tucked away in the leafy outskirts of Paris, the pool opened with Art Deco splendor in 1929, and soon became a magnet for all things chic. Sunbathers would lounge among celebrities and starlets, stretched out in white deck chairs and very often topless. One of its first lifeguards was an Olympic gold medalist-turned-actor who would go on to star in the film Tarzan. During winters, the pool was converted into an ice skating rink, and in summers it hosted galas and fashion shows, its cruise ship-like design providing an understated backdrop for some of the most provocative trends. It was here that the world's first bikini debuted in 1946, followed by the ill-fated ""monokini"" nearly two decades later. Outside of Paris, the venue is perhaps best known for its role in Life of Pi, the award-winning novel whose eponymous main character, Piscine Patel, is named after Molitor. In the book, Patel's father says he chose the name because he ""wanted his soul to be as clean as the pool's water."" ""It was an iconic place,"" says Frédéric Maynier, president of SOS Piscine Molitor, a local community group devoted to the preservation of the pool. ""You didn't go there just to swim, you went to be seen. It has always been like that.""  But things began to change as the century drew to a close. Molitor was closed in 1989, after the city of Paris decided to replace it with a new housing development. The building was saved from destruction after protests from local associations, but it suffered from a lack of maintenance and soon fell into disrepair. Over time, it drew skateboarders and graffiti artists who transformed it into a cathedral of urban culture. The clean rows of cabins designed by architect Lucien Pollet were turned into spray-painted murals, and its Olympic-sized pools became center stage for raves and concerts. Yet even in its decaying state, the building remained a historical monument, and locals still held hope for its revival. Those hopes finally came to fruition earlier this week, when the Piscine Molitor reopened as a new luxury hotel-club after nearly a decade of renovations. The new Molitor, inaugurated on Monday, is the result of an €80 million (about $109 million) project from French hotel group Accor, with financing from investment firm Colony Capital. Its designers aimed to breathe new life into the complex without losing its original Art Deco aesthetic. Image copyright Gilles Rigoulet Much of the building's exterior had to be rebuilt — its south-facing side is all that remains of the original facade — but extensive work went into restoring its mosaics and stained-glass windows, and its central pool retains its original blue-yellow color scheme. Inside are 124 sleek hotel rooms, replete with modern furniture and espresso machines, as well as a spa, gym, and rooftop bar. In a nod to its more recent past, the venue will also host regular exhibitions from local artists. The goal, according to designer Jean-Philippe Nuel, was to create a visual narrative of Molitor's 85-year transformation. ""The approach was to look at the pool like a character with many histories, many cultures — a birth in 1929 and today, a certain maturity,"" says Nuel, who designed the interiors at the new Molitor. ""The challenge was to connect these two points — its birth and current renaissance — with sometimes contradictory facets, like the 1930s windows next to a bomb of spray paint... Two worlds that have nothing to do with one another, and suddenly connecting them with a thread."" But some politicians have raised concerns over the pool's pricey entrance fees, which they fear will create a more stilted, exclusive atmosphere. Molitor was never free to the public, and its renovation was financed entirely with private funds, but entry fees were never as high as they are now. Just one day of swimming there now costs up to €180 (about $245), with annual membership fees of €3,300 ($4,500). ""I am not against the use of private capital,"" former socialist culture minister Jack Lang told Le Figaro this week. ""But places must be open to a wider audience."" It's unlikely that the Piscine Molitor will ever recapture the spirit of its mid-century heyday, but those who remember it say they're glad it's back in use — if only as a temple of collective memory. ""Children would do cannonballs, women would wear one-piece bathing suits and swim topless, you'd have a smoke after a swim, fingers still humid,"" recalls Gilles Rigoulet, a Paris-based photographer who shot a black-and-white series at Molitor during the 1980s. ""Thirty years ago, in pools, the norms of security, hygiene, aesthetics weren't the same. There were divers, hair, and bare breasts everywhere. It was the era of pleasure pools."" The outdoor ""summer"" pool looks much the same, but it's undergone dramatic changes over the years.

Designer Fernando Barbella is both entranced by and concerned with what all of these changes could mean, and he's created a series of images that depict what a not-so-distant year might look like with all of these advancements. Titled ""Signs from the Near Future,"" Barbella's new project takes the form of a Tumblr filled with photographs that present what's coming down the road in a manner that often seems as though it could turn out to be eerily accurate. ""I've been reading lots of articles and news lately related with innovation in science and technology,"" Barbella, who's based in Barcelona, tells The Verge by email. ""New materials, mashups between living organisms and nanotechnologies, improved capabilities for formerly 'dumb' and inanimate things... there a zillion things going on around us!"" Barbella wants his signs to not just depict that momentum and progress, but to reflect the potentially disturbing aspects of those advances as well. ""The fact is all these things are going to cease being just 'projects' to became part of our reality at any time soon,"" he says. ""I feel that as we increasingly depend on technology, we will probably have less space for individual judgment to make decisions."" Beyond that, Barbella sees an interesting dynamic in the public's push and pull against what new technology allows us to do. Though the technology grants people access to information and other cultures, it also poses issues of privacy and ethics that hold that back. ""I think we're going to get use to it,"" Barbella says. His images offer a look at why those issues are certain to keep coming — and at the same time, why many will ultimately fall aside.  Rich McCormick contributed to this report.

For several years now, it's been iterating on a concept product called CityHome that could efficiently pack key pieces of an apartment into a single modular unit, allowing owners to pull out a bed or a table and then store it again when they're through with it in order to free up space. Many concepts and even some actual products have already done this, but MIT's latest vision goes far beyond simple storage.   Just speak to get a party startedThe new vision would also allow the entire unit to move, sliding from side to side across an apartment to create more space in whichever room a person happens to be using. Items specific to that room might be built into the wall too, so that sliding the unit from one room into another might reveal a faucet on one side for use in a bathroom. This latest vision also tries to make the CityHome a bit more high-tech — and a bit more fun. For one, it'd respond to voice commands and hand gestures, allowing stored items to automatically fold out or be pulled back in with the wave of an arm. MIT envisions CityHome being connected to the rest of the apartment too, so gestures could be used to control lighting or whether the window shades are raised. The unit would also have long and colorful lighting strips built in that could start flashing disco-style whenever you say that you're ready to party. They're only a little bit tacky. An older vision of CityHome, from 2011. ""One potential scenario for the CityHome is where the bedroom transforms to a home gym, the living room to a dinner party space for 14 people, a suite for four guests, two separate office spaces plus a meeting space, or an open loft space for a large party,"" MIT Media Lab says in its description of the project. ""Each occupant engages in a process to personalize the precise design of the wall units according to his or her unique activities and requirements."" The goal is to make CityHome just 840 square feet in size, but capable of effectively adding two to three times that much space to an apartment. FastCo Design spoke with one of the project's leaders, and he tells them that CityHome will eventually be more than a concept.

""Reducing the Internet to a ‘public utility,’ imposing sweeping new taxes and destroying private investment, competition, and innovation while putting bureaucrats firmly in control."" ""Internet collectivism takes many forms."" Net neutrality is basically the 21st century version of Maoist China. As Ron and Rand Paul explain, ""Internet collectivism takes many forms, all of them pernicious….Around the world, the real threat to Internet freedom comes not from bad people or inefficient markets — we can and will always route around them — but from governments' foolish attempts to manage and control innovation."" Sure, we know the cable companies are bad, but big government is worse. ""I'm telling you, net neutrality is the next con game they're running. The question you need to ask yourself is: Do you want the people...? You may not like Comcast and you may not like AT&T and you may not like Time Warner,"" declared Rush Limbaugh. ""You may not like them, but do you want the people who gave you Obamacare running your Internet service? Do you want them in charge of what you can get and when you can get it and how much it's gonna cost you?"" ""Net neutrality is the next con game they're running."" The technologies we are all so excited to experience are being smothered in their cribs. ""Dear @FCC, you just set back online implementations of virtual reality 10 years #netneutrality,"" wrote Mark Cuban on Twitter. He has since deleted that tweet. But the reality of the FCC’s proposal is nowhere near this radical. In fact, if the stock market is any indicator, the new net neutrality rules won’t have any impact on the business or investment of the major internet service providers. Share prices for major internet providers were all up in the days after Chairman Tom Wheeler put forth his plan.  T Price data by YCharts At this point we still don’t have the full proposal to work from, just an editorial by Wheeler and a fact sheet highlighting the major points. But that document is enough to explain why investors didn’t react as if the sky was falling. Yes, the FCC will be using Title II to classify the transmission networks that carry out internet data as a utility. It’s using that authority to prevent ISPs from blocking or throttling data. Paid prioritization — fast lanes for those who can afford them — will also be banned. Verizon has admitted net neutrality won't hurt them But crucially, the FCC said it’s not going to impose the kind of common carrier restrictions that apply to utilities like our telephone networks. As the fact sheet makes clear, it won’t attempt to regulate the rates that ISPs can charge and it won’t force them to lease access to competitors at a set price. In other words, it won’t turn them into dumb pipes. Hell, even Verizon, talking with investors behind closed doors, has admitted that this kind of strong net neutrality won’t hurt their business or reduce future investment. Similarly, Republican legislators recently introduced their alternative plan, and the striking thing is that is calls for the same changes: prohibiting blocking, throttling, and paid prioritization. They just want Congress to be making that decision, not the FCC. Tim Wu, the man who coined the phrase ""net neutrality"", thinks their proposal is pretty good! So how to explain this dramatic reaction from Republican lawmakers and conservative pundits? It’s the same cynical, knee-jerk opposition that has defined the last six years of government. Whatever the president wants, they can’t stand. And even when it’s not Obama doing the deciding, they find a way to make it about him. ""Chairman Wheeler's proposal to regulate the Internet as a public utility is not about net neutrality,"" said a statement from Senate Commerce Committee Chairman John Thune. ""It is a power grab for the federal government by the chairman of a supposedly independent agency who finally succumbed to the bully tactics of political activists and the president himself."" By turning net neutrality into ""Obamacare for the Internet"" these alarmists have given themselves a political boogeyman, something they can trot out to scare voters and raise campaign dollars.

As part of the filing, RadioShack says it will sell off up to 2,400 of its US stores. Most other underperforming locations will close for good, but RadioShack's brand will live on through a store-in-a-store agreement with Sprint and Standard General, who will be purchasing many of the retailer's current shops. Here's what Sprint says consumers can expect from the new hybrid RadioShack / Sprint stores: Under the terms of the new agreement, Sprint would effectively operate a store within a RadioShack store, occupying approximately one third of the retail space of each location. Sprint employees will sell mobile devices and plans on all Sprint brands including Boost and Virgin Mobile. The stores will be co-branded with Sprint being the primary brand on storefronts and in marketing materials. Right now, Sprint says it has over 1,100 company-owned retail stores, a figure that would double if this deal is approved by the bankruptcy court. Assuming that happens, Sprint will enter 1,750 of RadioShack's locations, extending the retail footprint of America's third-largest carrier significantly. Sprint says the approval process should be complete within a few months. RadioShack's Chapter 11 filing reports assets of $1.2 billion and shows that the company had liabilities of $1.39 billion as of November 1st of last year. The ailing retailer was expected to close some 500 stores early in 2014, but shrinking revenues and underwhelming performance caused the company to bump this figure to 1,100 in a bid to save money. That plan was stymied, however, when RadioShack's lenders blocked the deal. That set the company on a course to destruction. Plans to revitalize brand image with concept stores, a new logo, and nostalgia-inducing Super Bowl ads failed to pay off, and the retailer's shares, lower than $1 for the early part of 2015, dipped to $0.24 when the company was suspended from the New York stock exchange earlier this week. RadioShack has a workforce of approximately 27,500 people, according to SEC filings. The retailer has failed to post a profit since 2011.

Instead of growing to a billion users without much money to show for it, the company's user growth has stalled out while its revenue has boomed. Its inability to keep pace with the size of rivals like Facebook and even Instagram has spurred rumors that CEO Dick Costolo will be forced out. To keep employees calm, Twitter executives have reportedly restricted access to crucial statistics, like the number of monthly active users. Oh, and its inability to deal with rampant abuse on the platform is causing core users to abandon ship. Today Twitter reported its fourth quarter earnings, posting $479 million in revenue and a Non-GAAP profit of $79 million. That's well above the $453.34 million in sales analysts projected and double the expected profit. The company's quarterly revenue grew 97 percent year over year and 111 percent when comparing annual revenue between 2014 to 2013. Investors have been willing to view Twitter through the lens of its Non-GAAP earnings, which discount the stock options it uses to hire and retain top talent. When those are factored in, the company continues to lose money, posting a net loss of $125 million for the quarter. Twitter's user base grew less than two percent As expected, user growth was the downside. The company reported just 288 million monthly active users, an increase of less than 2 percent from the 284 million it had last quarter. Analysts were predicting user growth of just 2.8 percent, or 292 million, but Twitter missed even that conservative estimate. Year over year the user base was up about 20 percent. Twitter says its growth would have been double the 4 million users it added in the quarter if not for issues with iOS 8. After the switch from iOS 7 to iOS 8, 1 million Twitter users disappeared, either because they forgot their password or didn’t download the app again. Another 3 million users were no longer counted as active due to a change in the ""Shared Links"" section of the Safari mobile browser. In iOS 7, Shared Links — which pulls in content shared by the people you follow on Twitter and other social networks — fetched content in the background automatically. As of iOS 8, Shared Links only fetches content when you visit that section of Safari. Because of this change, 3 million people who were counted as active users of Twitter in the previous quarter no longer were considered active.  Engagement as measured by timeline views, was also up less than one percent from last quarter and up 23 percent year over year. But Twitter is getting better at monetizing those views. The company earned $2.37 for every one thousand timeline views, up 60 percent year over year. Overall investors were happy with the report, and the stock was up more than 8 percent in after hours trading. Costolo says user growth will pick back up ""We closed out the year with our business advancing at a great pace. Revenue growth accelerated again for the full year, and we had record quarterly profits on an adjusted EBITDA basis,"" said Costolo. ""In addition, the trend thus far in Q1 leads us to believe that the absolute number of net users added in Q1 will be similar to what we saw during the first three quarters of 2014."" In terms of new products, Costolo said on the earnings call that the company will be pushing out its coverage of the upcoming Cricket World Cup to people who don't have a Twitter account. There were few details, although he mentioned it would work on both feature and smartphones. Part of the big picture strategy seems to be finding those key scenarios, like live sporting events, elections, and award shows, where Twitter's real time feed can deliver value to people who don't otherwise use its service, but where advertisers are plentiful. The company also confirmed the deal to begin showing tweets in Google searches which was reported yesterday.

The unspecified stake gives the internet giant a foothold in hardware for its smartphone operating system YunOS — best known previously as an iOS-clone — but the company faces serious competition from domestic and international rivals trying to tap the country's growing number of mobile internet users. China has 557 million mobile internet users Although internet penetration is still under 50 percent in China, the country already has 649 million web users — 86 percent of whom are logging on with smartphones and tablets. Chinese internet giants like search company Baidu and gaming-and-chat firm Tencent have already made the move to mobile, while a clutch of domestic smartphone manufacturers including Lenovo, Huawei, and Xiaomi are battling it out with multinational companies like Samsung and Apple to sell the actual hardware. Together, these five brands account for 60 percent of China’s smartphone market. Meizu, by comparison, has less than a 2 percent market share, but has grown its manufacturing output from a few hundred thousand units in previous years to close to 2 million in the last three months of 2014. It’s a relatively small base for Alibaba to break into the world’s largest smartphone market with, but it doesn’t have much of a choice. Google has previously forced manufacturers to drop Alibaba’s YunOS, with the US company protesting that the software is based on its own Android mobile OS but is not compatible with the wider Android ecosystem. Alibaba, meanwhile, maintains that YunOS is not a version of Android at all. Alibaba doesn't just need to attract mobile users — it needs to make money off them Whatever the case may be, Chinese mobile users can expect to see more of YunOS in the near future. Alibaba, meanwhile, has more immediate problems to deal with.

The performer and producer is a man who likes his toys high-tech and top of the line, especially drones. When he saw our first video on the new DJI Inspire One, he asked if we could help him get hold of a unit. What better place to test one out, we thought, than his expansive Toronto estate?  Spread out across several tables of gear next to his bed, deadmau5 had a number of different UAVs, including a couple of the ubiquitous DJI Phantoms and the high-end S-1000. One of the Phantoms was a little scuffed from crashing. “I’m thinking maybe we’ll take the beater out tomorrow and try and shoot it down,” he told me. I naively assumed he was joking. Drones were a popular gift this holiday season, and in my overview of the market back in July, I called them the coolest toys a gadget lover could own. But as I took the controls of the Inspire One for the first time, blasting it a couple hundred feet into the air over a tree line, so that my co-pilot manning the camera could grab a shot of deadmau5 bouncing around his property on an ATV, I realized that the word toy doesn’t come close to encompassing the danger, power, and potential of these machines.  Deadmau5 has only been living in his place for short while, and his neighbors aren’t totally sure what to make of him. They slowed their cars to a crawl as they passed by our afternoon shoot: a McLaren 650S doing drag runs with two drones in hot pursuit. I was piloting one, which I opened up to full throttle along a narrow dirt road, doing 50 miles per hour with trees hanging down from both sides. It never drifted, and it came slamming to a halt the second I let my thumb off the throttle. Before the advent of the Inspire One, we would have needed something like the S-1000 for this shot: a powerful craft with dual operator mode for one pilot and one cameraman. But as deadmau5 pointed out, flying the S-1000, even in a wide open rural setting like his estate, feels a little nerve-racking. At times, with its bulk, eight blades, and short battery life, it can be too much machine for a civilian, even one like deadmau5, whose idea of a good time is the Gumball 3000. The Inspire One never gave me that kind of hesitation. It was like an automatic handgun: smooth and satisfying, a little alarming when you realize what you’re capable of doing with it.     I previously called the Inspire One the coolest drone I have ever seen, and I can now definitively call it the best drone I’ve ever flown. I've tested dozens of units from different companies and put in probably 100 hours of flight time, so my perspective is that of a reasonably experienced drone enthusiast. But for this trip I also brought along two people — Sam Sheffer of The Verge and our friend Marques Brownlee — who were piloting for the first time in their lives. ""Flying the Inspire One for the first time was surprisingly easy,"" Marques told me. Despite being more powerful than the Phantom, the Inspire maintains DJI's trademark simplicity for beginners. ""Everything stayed super intuitive. I ended up navigating around at the same altitude a lot before I got used to being able to change altitude and create some more interesting flights."" The Inspire One outperforms any drone I’ve flown, but of course, it’s also considerably more expensive. At $3,000, it’s roughly double what you would pay for a high-end DJI Phantom and more than three times the cost of the newest units from 3D Robotics and Parrot. In that sense, arguably, you get what you pay for. And most people don't really need an aircraft capable of carrying Prof. Meowingtons (or at least his stunt double). But there is also a number of new features on the Inspire that distinguish it from the Phantom. The one that really stood out on this trip was the dual operator mode. The Inspire can transform to lift its legs during flight, giving you a full 360 degrees of unimpeded vision for your camera. As fairly novice operators, Sam and Marques were able to get great shots — that they never could have captured solo — of deadmau5 riding an ATV ride around his property. Another new feature is something DJI calls optical flow. It’s a downward-facing camera that helps to stabilize the unit by tracking the terrain below. A number of my crashes during my time learning with the Phantom happened during landing, when the little jumps and wobbles you don't notice in the air can become a big problem. With the Inspire, bringing the unit close ground causes the legs to return to landing position and the optical flow to kick in. We made several dozen flights on this trip, and there wasn’t a single crash during landing. There are definitely some things about the Inspire One that I don't love. The 4K footage it captures with its stock camera is decent, but not nearly as sharp as what you can get on a new GoPro. It's not powerful enough to carry end-up cameras like the REDs that deadmau5 uses on his S-1000, but it could easily handle many of the smaller action cameras on the market. Unfortunately, the Inspire has a proprietary camera mount that makes it tough to simply swap in your own gear. While I was impressed with the dual operator mode, it would be great to have autonomous waypoint navigation for times when you're flying alone, so that the unit could fly itself while you control the camera. DJI has pushed this capability to the Phantom and says it will be coming to the Inspire as well. But right now the lack of this ability means the Inspire trails competitors like the Iris+ from 3D Robotics, which can fly autonomously and even follow a user by locking onto the GPS in their smartphone. Is the Inspire the best drone you can own? That really comes down to budget and experience. If money is no object, than I think the answer is yes. It flies like a superior version of the Phantom, with nearly equal battery life, despite the extra weight, and several extra features that add new video capabilities. But if you're just starting out and an extra $2,000 will hurt your pocket, the Inspire is probably more power than you'll need. A $500 Phantom or Bebop will be more than enough to learn on and not break the bank if you crash it to smithereens. If you decide that you want more power and flexibility while filming, the Inspire feels like the perfect second unit, a step function that will open up new horizons. Just don't fly it over deadmau5's house uninvited. He's a very good shot.

For the past eight years, TechCrunch has hosted a bizarro tech world version of the Oscars called the Crunchies. The industry gets all dolled up, walks the ""green carpet,"" and watches Silicon Valley insiders present trophies for categories like ""Best On-Demand Service"" and ""Best Overall Startup."" At the eighth annual Crunchies last Thursday, the best startup award was handed to Uber CEO Travis Kalanick, while outside demonstrators protested Uber’s privacy violations, treatment of its drivers, and distaste for the rule the law. One sign said, ""UBER DESERVES A HIGH KALANICK."" It is not lost on TechCrunch that the founders and investors celebrated at the Crunchies are no longer starved for attention or validation. Perhaps to introduce a little more awareness of the bubbling absurdity, in recent years TechCrunch stopped using its own writers as emcees and hired comedians. You can watch the Crunchie intros get more caustic as the class tension rises. Last year, John Oliver told the audience: ""You’re no longer the underdogs, it’s very important you realize that,"" and then riffed on ways they were ""pissing off an entire city."" The Crunchies get more caustic as the class tension rises  The real joke, of course, is that a tech blog got Oliver to show up in the first place. This time, TechCrunch got T.J. Miller from HBO’s Silicon Valley, to host at Davies Symphony Hall. Twice, he referred to himself as a court jester. ""That’s why you invited me here. That’s how fucked up all of you are,"" he said. But the mood of the audience didn’t seem masochistic to me. Like Ricky Gervais at the Golden Globes, Oliver and Miller were paid to hassle the audience just enough to allow everyone to enjoy an extended evening of self-congratulations with a clean conscience. Then, mid-way through, Miller began to make the same missteps as Gervais. Within the span of a few minutes, Miller called a woman a bitch three times and casually threw out a racist remark. (You can watch the video here starting at about the 1:34:00 mark.) The first instance was when an audience member annoyed him by taking a flash photo.  Miller: That’s the perfect time to take flash photography. That shows how tech savvy you are. There’s three buttons you can choose: flash on, flash off, or auto, a.k.a. being kind of a rude bitch. The audience groaned, and Miller encouraged their disappointment. Miller: Whoaaaaah. I couldn’t wait to come to San Francisco, you guys are so cool about being teased. You’re not that precious here. A few minutes later, Miller had another off-the-cuff interaction, this time with Gabi Holzwarth, a violinist who plays at tech parties and the girlfriend of Travis Kalanick. She piped up after Miller made fun of Kalanick and Shervin Pishevar, a venture capitalist invested in both Uber and Shyp, a delivery company where Holzwarth started working. (Pishevar did not attend the event.) Miller: And the Crunchie for not constantly stepping in shit goes to Travis Kalanick. So does the Crunchie for constantly stepping in shit. Guys, if you’re worried they’re here, talk to Sherv, he’s down with it. Holzwarth: [inaudible] Miller: Is that Sherv? How are you doing, Sherv? Wait did a woman just say that’s me? Hey, look, Asians aren’t supposed to be this entitled in the United States. The audience groaned again. Miller: And that’s why you guys will never be as loved as Los Angeles. It’s all too precious, you can’t joke about it. She’s yelling that she’s Shervin Pishevar. Are you fucking nuts? That guy has seeded the most successful companies in the tri-state area and I’m talking about California, you bitch. Holzwarth: Did you just call me a bitch? Miller: I did not call you a bitch. I called Shervin Pishevar a bitch, but you seem to think you’re him. Shortly after that, Miller spotted Holzwarth’s dog on her lap and asked her to explain how she got it into the venue. Miller: Miss do you have your dog here? Is that real? Hold it up so everyone can see. [Cracks up] Oh my god, I’m going to ask you not to be funnier than the comedian tonight. ""Two questions. How did you get that dog in here? Second question: Did you Shyp it?"" #Crunchies #tjmiller #uber pic.twitter.com/qIh4IEXeJk  Then, he asked her to explain Shyp: Miller: [to Holzwarth] You press a button? A physical button or a digital button? [to audience] What is this bitch from Palo Alto? These are all examples of punching down, even if Holzwarth keeps interacting with him and there's some light-heartedness in between. Perhaps inured to it at this point, the audience just laughs. The next morning, Katie Jacobs Stanton, Twitter’s vice president of global media, who was at the Crunchies to accept Twitter’s award for ""Biggest Social Impact,"" wrote a piece on Medium called ""My first and last time at the Crunchies."" She mentioned the bitch incident (although the quote is a little off) and said she was thankful she hadn’t brought her daughter to the event. Ouch. Reports from Recode and Daily Dot also emphasized Miller’s remarks towards women. By Saturday, AOL exec Ned Desmond had issued an apology, along with a rather patronizing history lesson implying that those who were offended just didn’t get the jokes. TechCrunch also confirmed that Miller would not be invited back. If you were present, or watching the live stream, you might have been startled, if not offended, by some of the remarks that the host, standup comedian T.J. Miller made on stage. It’s also possible you found a lot of the show hilarious, which many people did. There is no definitive line between funny and offensive. Comedy has a long history of being used as a tool for satire and commentary. Many at TechCrunch, however, feel badly about some elements of T.J.’s performance. The use of derogatory slang to refer to women or minority groups is unacceptable at any event TechCrunch runs, period. And we know many others feel the same way, even if it’s hard to find the words to say so. We’re sorry. This is the second apology for sexist remarks at a TechCrunch event made in as many years. It served Desmond well, conveniently turning the focus to Miller, who is representative of a certain breed of comedian, not the tech industry. I love the show Silicon Valley. I laughed at many of Miller's jokes that night, at least before he over-indulged in something backstage and turned the closing remarks into a dizzy loop-de-loop. If AOL was concerned with making women feel welcome, Miller's history of sexist jokes is easy to find. But blaming Miller distracts from all the cringe-worthy, if not offensive elements at the Crunchies that were not ""startling"" in the slightest. The succession of men on stage started to look like a parade of lawsuits For example, at some point in the evening, the succession of men on stage started to look like a parade of lawsuits. Between Snapchat CEO Evan Spiegel; the co-founders of YikYak; Sean Rad, the former CEO of Tinder; and TechCrunch founder Michael Arrington, there were three allegations of stolen co-founder titles from close friends, one sexual harassment lawsuit, and one suit for defamation. Arrington filed the defamation suit, against his ex-girlfriend Jenn Allen for alleging that he physically abused and raped her. Arrington was giving out the Crunchie for ""CEO of the Year,"" which went to Marc Benioff, the Salesforce CEO and philanthropist who encouraged other companies to join him in his 1 -1 -1 pledge. Describing Benioff on stage, Arrington said: ""Sometimes somebody is so good you want to punch him in the face."" You could see the myth-making that smooths away those rough edges happen over the course of the evening. In his acceptance speech for ""VC of the Year,"" Jim Goetz from Sequoia Capital gestured at the ""group of Southern boys that are building a herd,"" referring to the co-founders of YikYak, the anonymous gossip app that recently secured a $400 million valuation. ""A year ago we were just two Southern boys playing ping pong,"" they said when YikYak accepted the Crunchie for ""Fastest Rising Startup."" The unofficial prize for the most ongoing lawsuits, of course, goes to Kalanick, who is currently facing a potential class action from drivers who allege they have been denied the rights of full-time employees. If the Crunchie voters were being real, they would have given Kalanick ""CEO of the Year,"" too. He’s the executive everyone in Silicon Valley wants to be.  It is naive to expect much from an awards show. (It's an awards show!) Why would the Crunchies celebrate diversity or true technological innovation when the industry itself doesn't prioritize that? Making Miller a scapegoat helps mask deeper issues. It's naive to expect much from an awards show (It's an awards show!) This was not the year for self-awareness. This was not the year for fear about what happens if the funding dries up or the profits never materialize. They could invite Miller to make fun of them because nothing really stung. You may resent us, but you can't keep up with us. Miller's interminable closing bit was one long haymaker, spinning in circles and only punching himself. He said at least a handful of different versions of the sentence: You are shaping American culture and maybe global culture. The only difference I can put forth is starring in Garfield 3D. Oliver sung a similar tune in 2012, telling the Crunchies: ""You’ve done companies that changed the world, I’ve voiced a Smurf.""   The Crunchies reinforce the certainty that these startups have already made a difference, which may explain the lackluster response to the civics segment of the show. Angel investor and philanthropist Ron Conway, the white-haired ""godfather of Silicon Valley"" reprimands the crowd like a disappointed principal for shirking their duties as a citizen of San Francisco or the South Bay (for him, the East Bay doesn’t exist). After Conway scolds the audience, he touts the achievements of Sf.citi, a civic group for tech companies that's widely regarded to be a dud, despite his efforts. Last year, Conway took the podium with Mayor Ed Lee, a man-sized political puppet. This time, the local official was London Breed, the first female president of San Francisco's Board of Supervisors in 16 years. Breed talked about growing up down the street in a public housing development in an apartment with five people that cost $700 per month. She appealed to the bootstrappers in the audience — the presenters for ""Best Bootstrapped Startup"" acknowledged that the days of self-sufficiency are over. ""You have created new jobs and new revenues for the city,"" she said, ""Yet right or wrong your success has also created tension."" Breed acknowledged the protestors outside, and she almost had me until she added, ""But to them I say, 'What is your solution?'"" Silicon Valley prides itself on a solutionist worldview. Founders are told to think of a problem and then build a company that solves it. They invent problems no one has just to say it's been fixed. She should have asked the auditorium.",0.6310633225262872,0.36893667747371284,0.8556123107869936,1878,4.9558040468583604,977,6.2354145342886387,0,2,"Business, Tech"

Cloud data is encrypted, but as long as the company manages the encryption keys, there are plenty of ways for third parties to gain access, whether it's a gag-ordered subpoena or something more sinister like PRISM. It's a long-standing problem for sensitive data in the cloud: as long as someone else holds the keys, there'll always be a way in. As long as someone else holds the keys, there'll always be a way in A new program from Box wants to fix that. It's called Enterprise Key Management, and it's offering a new approach to encryption on the cloud, providing the same cloud services without any central key control. Once a company signs up for the new system, Box will have no access to the encryption keys, giving the user complete control over who accesses the data. The system also comes with a protected audit log so users can track anyone who's accessed the data, providing an easy way to monitor for breaches. ""What we're really doing is giving people unprecedented control over their encryption keys,"" says Rand Wacker, Box's vice president of enterprise products.   Box has already done well selling cloud services to businesses, pulling off a $1.7 billion IPO just last month. Nearly half of the Fortune 500 uses some level of Box service, but Wacker says the most sensitive information is often cordoned off, either because of specific privacy laws or broader trade secrets concerns. The new key management features are an attempt to bring that last level of data. Wacker and his team have been working on it for two years, going into alpha in December and launching in beta earlier this year with World Bank and Toyota’s sales division. The system isn't entirely subpoena-proof The system isn't entirely subpoena-proof. Box is still liable for content hosted on its servers, and there are strict rules in the Terms of Service over how a user should respond in the event of a law enforcement request. Still, the system would effectively prevent the gag-ordered access system that currently exists for cloud services like Gmail and iCloud, in which users typically don't know their information has been accessed until charges have been filed. Under EKM, any law enforcement requests have to come direct to the user, and there's no way for Box to access the data without the user's permission. Most of the system is built on existing infrastructure, so Box's main job has been filling in the gaps and making the process as easy as possible for users. Keys are stored on Amazon's CloudHSM service, giving each user a dedicated hardware security module installed on a rack in an Amazon data center. The device is protected against physical access and will self-destruct if the wrong password is entered too many times. But once the code is entered, Wacker says users will have all the same Box functions as usual. A self-destructing encryption drive might sound like overkill, but for many industries, the possibility of third-party access is still a dealbreaker. Law firms have already raised concerns about the implications of cloud storage for attorney-client privilege, while others have speculated that storing data on the cloud might waive any legal protections for trade secrets. Box is hoping the new key management features will let those businesses finally venture onto the cloud. As Wacker puts it, ""it's a matter of unlocking cloud adoption for either the most sensitive companies or the most sensitive content.""",0.5119177162566184,0.4880822837433816,0.1667271428334899,594,4.9528619528619533,330,5.9545454545454541,0,2,Business

In November 2013, Finnish studio Supercell launched its massively popular mobile strategy game Clash of Clans on Chinese app store Wandoujia. With more than 450 million users who’ve downloaded 1.6 billion apps, Wandoujia is one of the biggest Android stores in China, a country where Google Play has no real presence. And many of those millions wanted to play Clash of Clans — in its first month on the store, the game was downloaded more than 200,000 times. But there was one big problem: the game used Google’s payment services for in-app purchases, but it’s a feature that Chinese gamers couldn't actually use. It was a huge hit that made absolutely no money. Supercell's accident isn’t an isolated incident. Plenty of Western game developers are looking to China and its burgeoning mobile scene as a new, untapped market to bring hit games. But it's also a market fraught with difficulties. There are language and cultural differences, a multitude of payment options, and if you're releasing on Android, there are literally hundreds of different app stores; Wandoujia may be among the biggest, but it's far from the only one. And due to the high level of piracy, free-to-play games dominate the market even more than they do in the West. Because of this, a cottage industry of publishers has appeared over the past few years with a focus on bringing mobile games from the West and adapting them to China. Sometimes the process is as simple as changing the in-app payment method, other times whole aspects of the game are changed, with new art and characters added in to appeal to the local audience. But it’s a business that’s growing, and growing fast. ""The market has evolved to become very, very crowded and competitive,"" says Henry Fong, CEO of publisher Yodo1.   Promotional art for Temple Run 2 in China. ""We really wanted to partner up with someone who understood the market."" One of the most recent examples of this phenomenon is Monument Valley. When the game launched on iOS, China proved to be the second biggest market, accounting for 12 percent of all sales. But when it came time to bring the Android version of the game to China, developer Ustwo decided to seek out a partner: iDreamsky, the company behind the Chinese versions of games like Temple Run and Fruit Ninja. ""We really wanted to partner up with someone who understood the market and the players within it,"" says Ustwo executive producer Dan Gray. ""Downloads and purchases surged following the launch of the game's first expansion pack in November 2014,"" iDreamsky CEO Michael Chen said in a press release, ""demonstrating the enormous appeal this game has to a very broad demographic which we are confident we can replicate in China."" It's still early, so it's not clear how Monument Valley will be changed to better suit China — ""those details are still to be decided,"" says Gray — but in some cases the alterations can be quite drastic. When iDreamsky launched Temple Run in China, for instance, it featured new anime-style character designs. Turn-based strategy game Hero Academy added a whole new team of fighters exclusive to the Chinese version; since local players wouldn’t relate to the game’s Tolkien-style fantasy world, the new characters were inspired by Chinese mythology instead. The story-heavy space sim Alpha Zero, meanwhile, had the entirety of its dialogue rewritten, so that it felt more natural for a Chinese audience. It even featured local voice actors and dialogue recorded at a studio in Beijing; one app store review described it as ""the best Chinese game ever."" And those small changes can have a big impact. The Chinese version of Ski Safari, published by Yodo1, featured music, art, and more customized specifically for the new market; a polar bear character was swapped with a panda, for example, while a penguin changed into a turtle. The result was more than 25 million downloads in just six months.   Promotional art for the Chinese version of Dots. Yodo1 operates a bit differently than a typical game publisher. Instead of simply providing funding and marketing support, the company does virtually all of the heavy lifting when it comes to making the new, localized versions of the game (Yodo1 calls this process ""culturalization""). A staff of more than 200 people produces new game content and features, and the publisher works so closely with developers that it usually has direct access to a game's source code. Fong says that each month Western developers submit around 200 games to the publisher, and a staff of 10 game reviewers analyzes them to determine which get published. Currently the company puts out around one or two games each month. ""We're really focusing on quality and suitability to the market,"" he says of the process. This wasn't always the case. When the company first launched — Fong had previously run a similar company that helped tech startups launch in China — it had to cold-call developers and hope they would be interested in releasing in China. Most weren't too comfortable with sharing their source code with a little known Chinese company. But thanks to successes like Ski Safari, the perception is changing. The same is true for similar publishers: Ustwo chose iDreamsky specifically because it had already worked with notable developers like Imangi and Halfbrick. Meanwhile, Dots is working with Chinese internet giant Tencent — the same company behind the ambitious PC game Call of Duty Online — to bring a localized version of TwoDots to China. Tencent also happens to be one of the companies involved in the studio’s most recent funding round That familiarity is a key selling point in a market where things can seem very foreign. ""The list goes on and on,"" Rob Segal, co-founder of Get Set Games, says of the different variables that can hinder a Chinese launch for a mobile game. Yodo1 published Get Set's mobile hit Mega Jump in China, and handled virtually every aspect of the process, including things that would simply be impossible for a tiny Canadian studio. The changes made to the game itself were relatively small and mostly centered around making it more social: for example, you’ll get a notification when you beat a friend's score in the Chinese version. But even with those smaller changes, there’s still a lot of work that goes into a port like this. ""I don't think you have any chance of success without working with a partner."" Playtesting, for example, isn't exactly easy when the audience is playing your game on a phone that hasn't even been released outside of China. Likewise, incorporating in-app payments, which are often handled through mobile providers, can be difficult for foreign companies. When you’re used to dealing with known entities like Google Play and the Amazon Appstore, the list of headaches adds up quickly, especially for a studio comprised of just a few people. ""We had games there before we had a partner,"" says Segal, ""and I don't think you have any chance of success without working with a partner."" China's mobile market isn't quite as mysterious as it once was — it's hard to imagine a company like Supercell making a similar mistake in 2015, given this new slate of publishers. And as the country becomes an even more important market for mobile games, developers are starting to think about it right from the beginning. Segal says that China is ""at the forefront of our minds"" when it comes to new game ideas, while Yodo1 recently published Hipster Whale's Crossy Road worldwide, so that it landed in China at the same time as the rest of the world. The game was downloaded more than 10 million times in its first 20 days of availability. Given those kinds of success stories, and the sheer size of China, the appeal is obvious. ""Knowing there's over a billion people who’ve never heard of Monument Valley is a great reason to want to release over there,"" says Gray.",0.6293993077470748,0.37060069225292525,0.531767408992282,1347,4.9279881217520414,638,6.2068965517241379,0,4,"Business, Culture, Entertainment, Gaming, Report"

According to The Hollywood Reporter, Marvel won't be paying a dime to put Spider-Man in one of its upcoming films, despite the fact that Sony still holds the character's film rights. Instead, Sony reportedly sees the free exchange as a way to bolster the Spider-Man franchise, which by most accounts should be doing far better at the box office than it currently is. Marvel is hugely successful at making superhero movies, and that means Spider-Man should be in much better shape the next time Sony puts him in a solo film.  Marvel will make money through merchandise That's a really interesting exchange for a whole host of reasons. Marvel's side is perhaps the simplest. For one, it's great news for Marvel's fans, who have wanted to see it take back Spider-Man for a long time. It'll also prime the studio's movie universe should it ever manage to reacquire the hero's film rights. But more importantly, the Reporter notes that Marvel still holds Spider-Man's merchandising rights, so there's still plenty of money for it to make off of Sony's films — especially when they're successful. What's more notable is that, with this deal, Sony is basically admitting that it's not very good at making Spider-Man movies. Under the agreement, Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige — who's generally seen as the mastermind behind the Marvel Cinematic Universe — will co-produce Sony's next Spider-Man movie. Sony retains final creative control on the films, so there's plenty that could go wrong, but the intention is quite clearly for Feige to work his magic. After all, Marvel isn't about to put its other characters into Spider-Man movies that it doesn't have faith in. The Reporter bolsters that understanding of this agreement with new details of how the film will be made at Sony. According to its report, producers Avi Arad and Matt Tolmach — who had been overseeing the Amazing Spider-Man franchise and its planned universe of spinoffs — will merely be executive producers on these new films. While that's a nice title, it reportedly means that they'll have little say creatively. That's a big change, and one that seems to show Sony stepping away from its existing ideas about the character. That said, Variety reports that Sony is moving forward with its plan to create a world of Spider-Man spinoffs, including Sinister Six, Venom, and an additional movie focused on women. Feige, reportedly, is not expected to have any involvement with the spinoffs. Even so, it's possible that he'll be around for the pictures focused on Spider-Man himself. Variety also makes it sound like we shouldn't be surprised to see Spider-Man pop up in more than one Marvel movie. How this partnership plays out in the longterm still remains unclear. Sony and Marvel intend to keep working together to some degree, but it isn't obvious how close that'll be. If fans want good Spider-Man movies, they should hope that Marvel remains intimately involved. It wouldn't be surprising for Sony to want that as well: the studio could use a huge franchise, and Marvel's involvement is the closest guarantee it can get to making a hit.

After convicting Tsarnaev of conspiracy to use a weapon of mass destruction and 29 other charges last month, today a federal court jury voted that he receive capital punishment in the form of lethal injection. Dzhokhar and older brother Tamerlan (who was later killed during a shootout with police) set off two homemade pressure cooker bombs near the finish line of the famed Boston Marathon. Three people were killed and over 250 were injured by the explosions and resulting shrapnel; many required amputations and other life-altering surgeries. Tsarnaev committed an act of terrorism: YES, jury unanimous on all applicable counts.  5- #Tsarnaev intentionally killed, intended to kill multiple people in single episode. Jury says yes to all applicable capital counts.  During his trial, the younger Tsarnaev's defense team tried to convince a jury that he'd been manipulated by his older brother. (Dzhokhar was 19 when he and Tamerlan executed the plot.) Tsarnaev's attorney, Judy Clarke, has a history of convincing jurors to spare her clients from death. During the sentencing phase, Clarke summoned witnesses including Tsarnaev's relatives, former friends, and teachers. And jurors generally agree that he had been well liked by educators and his former friends. Before the sentencing, parents of the youngest bombing victim also asked that capital punishment be taken off the table so as to prevent a drawn out appeals process and years of the painful memory resurfacing. 7: #Tsarnaev wouldn't have committed the crimes w/o Tamerlan? Three jurors agree.  But only three jurors agreed that Dzhokhar had been influenced by his older sibling and otherwise wouldn't have been involved. The prosecution's attempt to portray Dzhokhar as a ruthless terrorist and willing participant in the act ultimately proved more successful. Aside from those killed and injured at the scene, an MIT campus police officer was murdered by the Tsarnaevs as the manhunt to capture the brothers began.

Several of the officers apparently only received the emails, which were sent mostly between 2010 and 2012. But two high-ranking members of the department were central to sending them, said police chief Daniel Oates; one has retired and the other was fired. While Oates says the investigation is meant to make clear that ""this kind of behavior is over,"" it could also have ramifications for criminal cases where the officers were witnesses. Katherine Fernandez Rundle, state attorney for Miami-Dade, says that roughly 540 cases are being reviewed to see if racial bias could have compromised them. This is far from the first time police officers have been caught sending bigoted messages, which are often defended as jokes. This March, three officers in Fort Lauderdale, Florida were fired and one resigned after exchanging racist texts and making a similarly inappropriate video. In April, San Francisco's police department fired seven officers for texts about ""lynching African-Americans and burning crosses."" And in Ferguson, Missouri, a Justice Department investigation after the police shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown uncovered emails that mocked African-Americans as lazy and criminal. In some cases, the officers in question have defended the messages as jokes, but they're part of a larger pattern that has eroded trust in law enforcement. The Ferguson investigation, for example found evidence of bias in more concrete actions, like use of force and traffic stops. The New York Police Department — the largest in the country — has been taken to task in court for racial profiling.

While the company’s keynote covered a lot of the same ground as its E3 press conference in June, it also featured a number of new announcements that make the Xbox One more tempting than ever. There are improvements to the console itself, like the new DVR functionality, as well as exciting new games to play on it — including a whole lot of Halo. Here are the eight biggest announcements from the event in Germany. After a long wait, Remedy's TV / game hybrid Quantum Break finally has a firm release date: April 5th 2016. The footage seen at Gamescom (ostensibly its reintroduction) looks intriguing. We also got our first good glimpse at the all-star cast — including Shawn Ashmore, Aidan Gillen, and Lance Reddick — both as in-game characters and as live-action humans for the TV show counterpart.   Because super-powered agents in an open-world environment shouldn't be stopped by immovable chain-link fences, Realtime Worlds' Crackdown 3 will have a multiplayer experience that promises ""100 percent destructible environments"" (no word on if all modes will have the same carte-blanche mayhem). The trailer also claims that the game will use Microsoft's cloud to provide ""20 times more computational power"" than the Xbox One. Bold claims, but given Crackdown 3 has no firm release date, there's no telling when we'll see it in practice.   Microsoft's redesigned Xbox One dashboard, powered by Windows 10, is set for release in November. The new design is faster, easier to navigate, and features Windows 10 voice assistant Cortana (Kinect will be required for talking back).   While the Xbox One has transitioned away from its origins as an all-in-one entertainment device, it's not exclusively a gaming device. For those that have free-to-air digital TV tuners in US and Europe, starting next year Microsoft will let you record programs for streaming to any Windows 10 device in the house (or download for watching on the go).   One of the big surprise announcements from E3 was select Xbox 360 games being compatible with Xbox One. As we get closer to that November date, we're starting to see the fruits of that promise. All future Xbox 360 Games with Gold titles — those free full games that Microsoft offers a monthly basis — will be compatible with Xbox One. In practice, that means up to four games per month if you subscribe to Microsoft's Xbox subscription. That also means Just Cause 3 can launch with Just Cause 2 bundled, just in case you missed it the first time around.   Though Halo has long been a major part of e-sports, its influence has declined over the years, thanks in no small part to competition from Call of Duty. Microsoft hopes Halo 5: Guardians can change all that — and if that's not enough, a $1 million Halo World Championship launching later this year might also boost interest.   If you don't have an Xbox One yet — or you do but have a lot of money to kill — you can get a new limited-edition bundle designed around Halo 5: Guardians with metallic blue detailing on both console and controller. The 1TB model will cost $499 and is coming one week before Halo 5 (you'll still have to wait until October 27th to actually play). Ah, the surprise announcement of the show. The original Halo Wars was a 2009 real-time strategy game. We know next to nothing about the sequel other than it's being made by the same studio who did the great horror title Alien Isolation.

But in 2015, practical effects and stunts aren’t exceptions to special effects rules. As some of the biggest movies of the year — namely Rogue Nation, Mad Max: Fury Road, and the upcoming Star Wars: The Force Awakens — rely more and more on real-life actors for their action scenes, we might be seeing the start of a shift away from CGI as practical effects become a bankable alternative.  There’s certainly no question that CGI can take fantasies and make them seem like reality on the big screen. Recent successes like Furious 7 and Avengers: Age of Ultron wouldn’t be possible without computers allowing for flying suits of armor and cars flying out of buildings. But after more than a decade of high-octane CG theatrics from huge box office juggernauts like Transformers, Harry Potter, Avatar, Star Wars, Star Trek, Terminator, literally anything the Wachowskis make, and every Marvel and DC tentpole, audiences might be getting fatigued of digital models exploding into countless pixels. As Variety TV columnist Brian Lowry put it after seeing Age of Ultron, CGI can now prove ""more numbing than exciting, even during what should be the show-stopping sequences."" CGI can prove ""more numbing than exciting."" Hollywood’s reliance on CG has only intensified. In the 1970s and ‘80s, movies like Westworld and Tron made use of rudimentary computer graphics to dazzle audiences who’d never seen such worlds on the big screen. Fast forward to 2014, and we got Transformers: Age of Extinction, a movie full of so much visual noise that it was hard to tell what was even going on. As computers have gotten more powerful, studios have used them to create bigger spectacles. Bigger spectacles translate to bigger box office returns; according to Box Office Mojo, six of the top 10 highest grossing films of all time were CGI-fueled summer epics that came out in just the last five years. Three came out this year alone. Raising the stakes for what what we expect from our popcorn fare inevitably means upping the visual ante. That’s not necessarily a bad thing, so long as it’s done well. But in overindulging what it thinks is our bottomless appetite for bigger, more bombastic movies, Hollywood might be battering our senses to the point of dullness. As Matthew Zoller Seitz wrote for RogerEbert.com last year: In other words, all this is expected, and the miracles that cinema pulled off 30 years ago — the moments when audiences felt transported to the directors’ dreamscapes — now feel rote. But in recent years, there’s been an attitude shift bubbling up among some of Hollywood’s biggest-budget filmmakers. In a recent interview on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, Rogue Nation co-star Simon Pegg talks about the merits of dangerous stunts over CGI:  ""These days,"" he says, ""CG is an amazing tool, and we love it and it enables us to do amazing things. But when you see something which is digital, there’s a slight sense of disconnect. You know it’s not real. Tom taped himself to the side of a plane for real! That’s how much he cares about you!"" ""You know it's not real."" There actually is a visceral sense of danger and even wonder as you’re forced to acknowledge that a human being is risking their life for a film, much in the same way that there’s a greater feeling of connection to a person in makeup over her CG counterpart. That’s certainly true for Mad Max: Fury Road, whose promotional push made much of the fact that it was shot in the Namibian desert with real cars, real explosions, and a real flamethrowing guitar, as if to remind people that things like that could still be pulled off in real life. Of course, director George Miller also used plenty of digital effects to push his scenes over the top. Of the film’s 2,400 shots, 2,000 of them were VFX shots. But set pieces that might have been done purely by computer in other movies were choreographed in real life, making for some beautiful but incredibly dangerous scenes.  And it’s especially true for Star Wars: The Force Awakens, which hits theaters later this year. Director J.J. Abrams has continually and consistently paid deference to the practical ingenuity that made the original trilogy so great. So in addition to the return of the original starring cast, we’ve also been promised a return of practical effects. The new X-Wing? Real. BB-8? Real. The Millennium Falcon? So real as to injure Harrison Ford on set. These decisions are billed as a return to form, as a chance to go back to the way things are supposed to be.  And that’s likely the whole point — that striving for verisimilitude today means moving away from the CG that’s an industry standard and reminding audiences of how directors like Spielberg and Lucas did it way back when. It’s clear that, at a time when so many of today’s movies are reboots or returns to older properties, studios are trying hard to mine for what made people feel so good about going to the movies in the first place. Directors like Abrams and actors like Tom Cruise seem nostalgic for a time when connecting to magical objects, spaceships from far-off galaxies, and actual peril meant relying on props, makeup, wires, and daring. They’re both saying that today’s CG landscape can’t pull that off because we take computerized effects for granted. That doesn’t mean that practical effects are inherently better or that CGI shouldn't ever be used. It just means that, like music lovers preaching the gospel of vinyl, some directors are pushing back against CGI because practical effects express their ideas about how their particular movies — and maybe movies in general — ought to be made. Practical effects are like vinyl for cinema At the end of the day, though, Mission: Impossible — Rogue Nation is just a popcorn flick, diverting but ultimately empty. Special effects can never replace the connection created by an excellent story that keeps you invested from start to finish. But you do feel something during those stunts, an elevated kind of thrill knowing Tom Cruise really is on that plane or on that motorcycle, risking his life so that we can have fun for a couple of hours at the movies. It could be argued that Rogue Nation would be no better if the whole thing were done with green screen. After all, real-life action gets our attention right now primarily because it feels so different. But with the next few years positively glutted with action movies, ""different"" might have a leg up on the competition.",0.6300232531386962,0.3699767468613038,0.17765097304031732,1259,4.8641779189833203,644,6.0978260869565215,0,0,"Culture, Entertainment, Film"

Now, though, Florida subscribers can get truly unlimited data — but it costs an extra $30 a month. As first noticed by DSL Reports, Comcast is introducing a new option in its Florida markets of Fort Lauderdale, the Keys, and Miami. Normally, customers who exceed 300GB a month would pay an extra $10 per 50GB of data, with a three-month grace period before the charges kick in. But by enrolling in a plan that costs $30 more per month (regardless of whether users exceed the cap), they can theoretically use as much bandwidth as they want. If you choose to enroll in the Unlimited Data Option, you will pay a flat fee of $30 per month regardless of how much data you actually use. That way, you can have the certainty of knowing exactly what your bill will be each month. However, like all other Xfinity internet customers, your use of the Xfinity internet service must be consistent with our Acceptable Use Policies and network management system. Comcast's limits are more liberal now than they were three years ago, when the company lifted a flat 250GB cap for home subscribers. Since then, it's been testing different tiered pricing models, which could ultimately be incorporated into a nationwide plan. Most places are cap-free, but Comcast is currently running trials in parts of nine states: Florida, Alabama, Arizona, Georgia, Kentucky, Maine, Mississippi, Tennessee, and South Carolina. The options vary. In Tucson, Arizona, data limits are scaled up for faster internet packages, and a separate ""flexible"" option offers a $5 discount to people who shrink their monthly usage to 5GB or less. Business customers, as well as people who sign up for Comcast's 505Mbps and Gigabit Pro internet tiers, are exempt from caps.

First up, though, are the 300 series and 500 series which offer the most powerful innards, with sixth-generation Intel chips available for both (or low-end Braswell processors for the 300 series), up to 1TB of HDD or hybrid storage, and as much as 16GB of RAM (although only if you pick Skylake chips). The 300 notebooks are available with 14-inch, 15.6-inch, or 17.3-inch screens, while the 500 series comes in 14-inch or 15.6-inch flavors. Lenovo is marketing these as light and portable machines, with the 14-inchers both weighing in at 2.1 kg and the 15.6-inch laptops tipping the scales at 2.3 kg. Prices for the 14-inch 300 start at $399, and for the 15-inch at $549; for the 14-inch 500 at $499 and the 15-inch at $599, with availability for all of these machines starting in October. The Ideapad 500 offers Intel's RealSense 3d Camera If this list of figures and specs has sent you reeling, well, we know how you feel. They might have confused Lenovo a little too, because it seems that you can get a high-specced Ideapad 300 that is pretty much as powerful as a Ideapad 500. The only major differences are that on the 500 series you have the option of slightly better graphics (a Radeon R7 M360 vs a Radeon R5 M330), as well as Intel's RealSense 3D camera. This enables cool tricks like unlocking your computer with your face on Windows 10, although there is a caveat: RealSense is only available on the 15-inch model. To add to this already confusing cast list, Lenovo is also introducing the 300s and 500s range — lighter machines with less RAM (a maximum of 8GB) and less punchy graphics. They do, however, come with Skylake chips as standard and have up to 1TB HDDs or hybrid storage options. The 500s series is available in 13.3-inch, 14-inch, or 15.6-inch options, while the 300s Ideapads are available ""up to 14-inches."" Prices for the 300s with an 11-inch screen start at $249, while the 13-inch 500s will start at $499. Both ranges will be available from October this year. There is certainly an intimidating array of options to choose from here, but Lenovo's strategy at least ensures there's a machine to suit most peoples' needs.

A month ago, it introduced the first members of its sixth-gen Core family — better known by the codename Skylake — in the form of the overclocking-ready Core i7-6700K and Core i5-6600K, a pair of desktop chips primarily aimed at gamers. Today at IFA, the American chipmaker is unfurling the full breadth of its Skylake range, which will span the broadest spectrum of devices in the company’s history. Intel will have Skylake processors going from a 4.5W TDP designed for ultra-thin, fanless machines all the way up to 91W for workstation and enthusiast gaming purposes. Kirk Skaugen, the general manager of Intel’s Client Computing Group and the person charged with expanding the company’s mobile business, will be presenting the news in a keynote address on Wednesday that will kick off a busy day of IFA 2015 press conferences. OEM partners like Acer, Asus, and Lenovo will then be following up with their announcements of new machines using the new processors, putting real hardware meat around the beating heart of Intel’s latest. Ahead of the show, Skaugen sat down for an interview with The Verge to discuss Intel’s strategy with its new family of chips and the close collaboration with Microsoft that leads him to believe that there’s never been a better time to buy a new PC. ""This is something that only happens once every decade or so,"" opines Skaugen while describing the perfect synchronicity in the release of Windows 10 and the sixth-gen Core processors. It’s rare for a brand new operating system to coincide so neatly with a new CPU generation, and the shared hype is likely to drive positive sales for both Microsoft and Intel. But there’s more to this coincidence than mere serendipity. Skaugen says Intel has been working on the Skylake architecture for more than four years, and it’s collaborated with Microsoft on generating some synergies along the way. The RealSense cameras that Intel has been developing over the past couple of years now facilitate the Windows Hello face unlocking feature of Windows 10. For businesses, Skaugen promises ""this will be the most secure software and processor combination ever"" thanks to built-in software guard extensions. Intel is also integrating a sensor hub and an image signal processor into some of its mobile-focused processors, consolidating all processing and making things simpler for the software engineer.  The coolest new feature in Skylake, though, is a technology Intel calls Speed Shift. Before the sixth-gen Core CPUs, the operating system would be responsible for giving cues when more or less performance is needed and the processor would adjust its speed accordingly. That reaction would usually take 30ms, but now Intel has shifted the intelligence over to the processor and is allowing it to make the determination itself. The latency is reduced to just 1ms and the end result is a more responsive and power-efficient system: a win for Intel, Microsoft, and the end user. A Windows 10 update will enable this functionality in the ""near term,"" and it might be something we can expect on Mac computers as well, though Skaugen refuses to divulge specifics on Apple’s plans. He would only say that the ""architectural benefits and things that are in Skylake, we would hope and expect Apple to make use of."" Among the things encouraging Skaugen to be bullish about Intel’s present release is also the rapid pace of iteration that he anticipates with Windows 10. ""The evergreen release cycle of Android and iOS coming to Windows helps Intel light up new hardware features that much faster."" It used to be, he says, that Intel would have to wait for two or three years until a major OS update would harness the latest additions or integrated technologies in Core processors. Now, with Windows 10 being subject to continual and regular improvement, he sees opportunity for a much faster turnaround. With Intel CEO Brian Krzanich recently admitting that Intel may be slipping in its long-established adherence to Moore’s Law, there’s an understandable shift within the company to deliver more than just pure computing power. That’s not a recent phenomenon, but it’s felt more starkly now than ever. This is why, as Skaugen explains, more and more transistors in the chip are used for things beyond pure CPU performance. There’s security and graphics, and dedicated engines to help with things like 4K video encoding and decoding. All of these combined efforts, plus the help of willing partners like Microsoft, should ensure that ""innovation won’t slow down for the end user."" Skaugen is also unwilling to ""accept the idea that things will slow down after 10nm,"" suggesting that the jump after the next shrinking in manufacturing size might not take as long. But that’s all far off into the future. Intel is at 14nm today, with Skylake being a very fast successor to the Broadwell series that only debuted this January. It initially seemed like Skylake would focus on ramping up performance, given Intel’s launch of fast desktop parts, but Skaugen says Intel’s emphasis has been on the mobile end of the spectrum. The flagship Skylake product, if there were to be such a thing, would be the 2-in-1 hybrid device. Whether that’s a tablet with a keyboard attachment or a laptop with a 360-degree hinge, Intel has witnessed this category grow dramatically. Skaugen says that 2-in-1s are the fastest-growing device type after phablets, so it’s hard to fault Intel’s strategy. The new Core M processor, part of Intel’s Y Series, will be much improved, and this time it will have enough performance flexibility to be segmented into three tiers: M3, M5, and M7. ""With sixth-gen Core M,"" promises Skaugen, ""you’ll get about twice the performance of the best tablet out there today, whether it’s an iPad or a Galaxy tablet."" At the same time, Intel is working on developing a wireless charging standard for detachable keyboards, which it hopes to combine with these most mobile of chips to essentially turn your tablet’s keyboard into a charging dock, minus the charger wire. This is where Microsoft’s support and quick implementation comes into play again, and that relationship will continue to be important as Intel looks to push other technologies like its upcoming Thunderbolt 3 interconnect. Employing a slightly more expansive definition of ""mobile,"" Intel’s Skylake also marks the company’s debut of overclocking-ready K Series processors for notebooks. ""We look at the enthusiast and gaming community,"" explains Skaugen, ""and we see [that] increasingly, people are going mobile. People want to game when they’re traveling."" Intel has seen great interest from ""both the boutique gaming players and the big OEMs"" and Skaugen expects them all to get into laptop gaming with a renewed vigor. As to the more professional user, there are now also mobile Xeon models among Intel’s sixth-gen lineup, which Skaugen says will allow 3D designers to work on the move without having to carry their assignments ""all the way across town."" The Xeon-powered machines, he says, will be ""kind of luggable, but still portable.""   There’s a symmetry of purpose between Intel’s efforts and Microsoft’s. One wants its software to be ubiquitous and running on everything, the other wants its chips to be omnipresent and powering everything. Skaugen articulates Intel’s mission as ""a continuum of performance, from servers to wearables."" But he also sees Intel’s role as evolving toward being a ""communications and connectivity company as much as an IT company."" A decade ago, Intel was ""a PC company aspiring to sell PCs and servers."" The new vision for the future is one where ""if it consumes electricity, it computes; and if it computes, it connects; and if it’s smart and connected, it will be best to have Intel."" The obvious gap in Intel’s connectivity continuum is actually the most popular and important category of them all: smartphones. That’s the Achilles heel that Intel doesn’t like to talk about much, but it’s certainly something the company is taking seriously. ""Smartphones are incredibly important to our business,"" says Skaugen, while noting Intel’s growing 4G modem business and established strong reputation in China. Capitalizing on a positive brand association with quality and security might help Intel break into the highly competitive Chinese market, and Skaugen believes there’s opportunity there simply by virtue of ""a tremendous customer preference for choice."" Phone makers want to have more options than just Qualcomm modems and ARM processors, and Intel is working to try and provide them with viable alternatives. ""We are making progress,"" says Skaugen, ""and we are in this for the long haul."" Kirk Skaugen’s mission of transitioning Intel to being the provider of more than just PC processors is well under way. The funny thing is that it’s happening in parallel with Microsoft’s redefinition of what a PC is or can be, and so even as Intel moves into new device segments and areas of business, it might still find itself technically providing parts for Windows PCs. That will probably be just fine by Skaugen, who seems determined to ensure that every single electronic device out there has at least a little bit of Intel inside it.",0.7715115219784716,0.22848847802152839,0.18022393466234687,1540,5.1500000000000004,745,6.4778523489932889,0,12,"Microsoft, Mobile, Tech, IFA 2015, Interview, Report"

That all sounds similar to Microsoft's Surface Pro 3, and if you look at the Miix 700 then you'll see the similarities aren't minor.   They start with the kickstand. The Miix 700's hinge is one of the more interesting aspects of this tablet. Lenovo calls it a watchband hinge, and it works in a similar way to the recent Yoga hinges available on the company's convertible tablet. It also works very much like the Surface Pro 3, but during our brief testing it doesn't seem to resist as well as Microsoft's tablet or feel as sturdy and strong. While the kickstand looks similar, Lenovo has gone a step further and created a keyboard that even magnetically snaps onto the screen of the Miix 700. That's something Microsoft did with its latest Surface Pro 3 keyboard to improve lap use, but Lenovo's feels thicker and bulkier in the process. There's even a stylus that attaches to a spare USB port. With the kickstand, keyboard, and stylus in place, it's hard to tell the Miix 700 and Surface Pro 3 apart.

Models go all the way up to the Core m7 coupled with up to 8GB of RAM. There's even the option of adding LTE or Intel's RealSense 3D camera if you want to capture depth images from the rear camera.

Earth is stuck near the edge of the Milky Way, tucked in a quiet spot just off of one of the galaxy's spiral arms. The center of our galaxy, on the other hand, is an extremely busy place. If we're in the suburbs, the galactic center is Times Square; it's packed full of stars that are dead or dying, giant gas clouds, and of course, one supermassive black hole. And while astronomers learn a lot about our galaxy by looking at its cosmic doppelgängers, there's still much to be gained by studying the busiest parts of our own. If we're in the suburbs, the galactic center is Times Square The problem is all that clutter makes studying the galactic center a difficult task. That makes it tricky to study high-energy x-rays and the special objects that emit them. But a paper published yesterday in Nature marks an important step in this process thanks to work done with the NuSTAR telescope by a group from Columbia University. NuSTAR is the first space telescope that lets astronomers study high-energy x-rays in very fine detail, which makes it the perfect tool to cut through the low-energy clutter in the core of our galaxy. ""It was like turning off the lights on all that low-energy stuff,"" says Kerstin Perez, a co-author of the paper who worked with the group at Columbia. With the noise out of the way, the astronomers found that the galactic center was also teeming with high-energy emissions. But what are these emissions coming from? Perez says they're caused by one of two things: stellar remnants (white dwarfs, neutron stars, low-mass black holes) or cosmic rays emitted by the supermassive black hole. The leading theory thanks to these new observations is that it's likely the former, more specifically ""accreting"" white dwarfs — or as they're popularly referred to in astronomy, ""vampire systems."" The name comes from the way a white dwarf — which is the incredibly dense remnant of a once-burning star — sucks the matter off of a binary star companion, a common occurrence in the universe. Vampire stars feed off their binary counterparts The source of these emissions is still open to debate, and Perez says that each one of the possibilities creates its own complications. For example, if the high-energy x-rays are coming from dead stars, Perez says there's either something very different about the way they objects behave near the high activity of the galactic center, or we might have been wrong about how they behave in general. Her questions unravel from there. ""How did all those really heavy white dwarfs get there? Is it that they’re forming there? Or is it that they’re formed a little bit further away, and then through gravity they’re getting pulled in close to the galactic center? Or is it that, in combination with those two things, that there’s something about the really dense environment of the galactic center that these objects tend to become accreting objects with a much higher probability?"" Perez happily embraces all the new questions that her group's findings raise just as any good scientist would. She might not have those answers yet, but at least now the path is a little clearer.",0.7070420204937746,0.2929579795062254,0.22287295718799124,565,4.8884955752212393,300,5.7566666666666668,1,0,Science

Earlier research has detected traces of Ebola in semen months after the onset of symptoms, but it's never been seen this long afterward. And while there has been a prior report of Ebola being sexually transmitted in the late ’90s, it was ultimately inconclusive. This instance could become the first confirmed case of sexual transmission, or at least prompt further research that confirms the possibility. It's notable in this case that the man, who appears to be a survivor of Ebola, was never conclusively determined to have Ebola. After being tested in September when he experienced Ebola-like symptoms, one test came back positive and another came back negative. An additional test taken about a week later also came back negative, and he was discharged from a treatment unit not long thereafter. While that leaves some room for uncertainty, multiple family members that the man lived with or interacted with contracted or appeared to contract Ebola as well. CDC recommends avoiding contact with semen from Ebola survivors Because prior research had detected the presence of Ebola in semen months after contraction, both the CDC and the World Health Organization had been recommending that male survivors refrain from sex or use a condom for three months. The CDC is now recommending that people avoid contact with a male Ebola survivor's semen indefinitely, until more is known. If a male survivor has any type of sex, the CDC says that a condom should be used. Additional research is going to be performed on both male and female body fluids to see how the virus persists and if sexual transmission is likely. In Liberia, where these patients are located, the Ebola epidemic appears to be winding down. Aside from this instance, the country has gone over a month without a confirmed case of Ebola. The US is starting to pack up, shutting down a treatment center, and the country may be nearing a declaration of being Ebola-free, according to the Associated Press. Liberia has had over 4,600 deaths from Ebola since the virus first broke out there in March, 2014.",0.17464065396568995,0.82535934603431,0.8797097963629478,514,4.8501945525291825,266,5.9135338345864659,0,0,Science

But there are steps that legislators can take to prevent the newly legal drug from falling into the hands of minors, according to researchers from Johns Hopkins University's Bloomberg School of Public Health. A new report in the medical journal Pediatrics outlines four tested tactics for proposed regulation. Colorado, Washington, Oregon, Alaska, and Washington, DC have passed laws legalizing the recreational use of marijuana, and the use of medical marijuana is legal in 23 states and the District of Columbia. While 14 US states have decriminalization laws in place, which reduce the severity of sentencing for marijuana-related crimes, the report's authors argue that legalization and regulation, not decriminalization, will ultimately lead to the safest use and distribution of marijuana. The relative novelty of legalized weed creates an opportunity for regulators to choose how best to approach marijuana, says Brendan Saloner, an assistant professor in the Department of Health Policy and Management at the Bloomberg School. ""There’s a window of opportunity here. The window doesn’t fully close, but the reality is there’s a much greater momentum to try to think about smart regulatory approaches early on,"" Saloner said. ""Our message is that state legislatures can seize this opportunity now while the issue is still fresh in the agenda."" Regulation over decriminalization The report suggests states can apply four strategies to limit the ways in which legal marijuana can enter the illegal market and reach kids: increase taxes on the drug, regulate retail stores where marijuana is sold, regulate packaging, and limit the use of marketing. For the most effective regulation, Saloner says these tactics should be used in tandem, rather than selectively. Saloner says the existing regulations surrounding alcohol and tobacco provide a useful context for marijuana. ""There’s a precedent in alcohol and tobacco regulation,"" Saloner said. ""Price is a big factor in initiation and use of both cigarettes and alcohol among underage youth."" And because it's nearly impossible to prevent legal marijuana from entering the black market, higher taxes on legal weed will in turn increase the price of illegal weed. The report also calls for strict monitoring of the marijuana supply chain, which includes the development of licensing policies that can be applied to all ""actors"" in the chain. The authors argue that states should strongly enforce existing laws penalizing dispensaries from selling marijuana to minors. These dispensaries should also be prevented from opening near institutions where children are often present, like schools and playgrounds. The potency of marijuana has increased over the past decade   Just as tobacco companies are banned from television markets in the US, the marketing of marijuana can also be limited. For example, marketers can avoid broadcasting during children's television shows or on social media. Although online advertising is not regulated, some companies, like Google, already voluntarily refuse to host marijuana advertisements. One potential roadblock in making sure legal weed only reaches the intended customer is home cultivation. Because home cultivation is currently allowed in every state that has legalized recreational marijuana (excluding Washington), regulating these jurisdictions becomes more difficult. ""It’s an area where there’s going to have to be a little bit of learning going on to strike an appropriate balance between people’s civil liberties and trying to think a little bit more about how to protect children,"" Saloner said. ""It’s an area where there’s going to have to be a little bit of learning going on."" In recent years, Colorado and Washington have both adopted comprehensive requirements for the packaging of retail marijuana to prevent use by minors, but Saloner says regulation could be stronger in all states. Marijuana is still illegal on a national level — despite a recently introduced bill hoping to reclassify it as a medical drug — but the federal government has said it is unlikely to exert authority if individual states have voted for legalization.",0.6147974946315278,0.3852025053684722,0.5399613568142022,668,5.4940119760479043,360,6.7222222222222223,0,0,"Policy & Law, Science, US & World"

In Target's case, the retail giant will use Tesla's Powerpacks at certain stores, acting like more efficient generators to relieve stress on the electrical grid and draw power during shortfalls.

Batteries, he said, would ""bridge the gap between intermittent production, from sources like wind, and the data center's constant power demands.""

Tesla says its Powerpacks help ""firm up"" this generation of energy from renewable sources, storing excess electricity from a range of sources until it's needed.

Buildings, powerlines, antennas, and wind farms are also causing millions of animal deaths each year, according to a second study published in Science today. Overall, humanity’s effect on animal species isn’t looking very good. ""We face losing one in six species."" ""Global biodiversity provides the foundation for economy, culture, food, and human health,"" says Mark Urban, an ecologist at the University of Connecticut and the author of the extinction study. Unfortunately, ""if we continue on our current trajectory of greenhouse gas emissions, we face losing one in six species."" In the extinction study, Urban compiled results from a number of published studies in order to produce an analysis of climate-induced extinctions risks. As global temperatures continue to rise, the loss of species diversity is accelerating, he found. Urban's study also revealed that species face the highest extinction risk in South America, Australia, and New Zealand. And in one model of climate change, Urban assumed a modest rise in temperature — only two degrees, compared with temperatures recorded before the Industrial Revolution. Even using that figure, which is widely considered an underestimation, the extinction risk for any species of animal almost doubles, to 5.2 percent from 2.8 percent. Should temperatures increase by 4.3 degrees Celsius, however, 16 percent of the world’s species could find themselves at risk for extinction. To forecast extinction risks, Urban looked at factors including species characteristics and distributions, global temperatures, and a region's features. ""I spent lots of my time searching for studies that predicted extinction risk from climate change, understanding them, and extracting data,"" Urban says. ""It took me over a year to find 131 studies out of thousands."" Urban also made sure to weed out lower-quality studies. ""For example, I concentrated on multi-species studies that are less likely to choose a particular species because of its predetermined risk,"" he says. In the second study, scientists looked at the effect of human activity on airspace. As with the extinction study, the researchers compiled results from previous published work. They found that buildings, wind farms, powerlines, and antennas threaten billions of animals each year and cause millions of deaths. Animals crash into windows and planes, for instance, and are forced to alter migration patterns. And this isn’t just causing animal deaths; over 200 people have been killed because of aircraft collisions with birds, the researchers note. ""We are drawing attention to the importance of the airspace."" ""It was only as recently as 2013 that researchers proposed that the airspace be recognized as habitat,"" says Emily Shepard, a bioscientist at Swansea University in the UK and a co-author of the airspace study. ""We are drawing attention to the importance of the airspace, in terms of all the organisms that depend on it and the services they provide."" Overall, collision rates are increasing, she says. And new uses of the airspace, such as drones, are also likely to cause conflict — ""though this is so new that there has only been one systematic study of the effects of drones on animals to date, and this focused on three species of waterbird."" There have been some successful interventions that have helped reduce conflict. New York City, for example, announced that it would join others cities in the US that will turn off their lights when songbirds migrate; lights can disorient birds and cause them to crash into windows. Still, there's a lot more that could be done to reduce human-animal competition for airspace. Efforts like making windows more visible and maintaining untouched ""airspace reserves"" for aerial wildlife, for instance, would go a long way. Now that the extinction study has been published, Urban is working on developing more sophisticated models of predicting responses to climate change that incorporate things like species interactions, for instance. And the airspace researchers are hoping to collaborate on a map of the movements of Andean Condors. ""Condors are very particular — their huge size means that they are dependent on finding rising air in order to fly and find food,"" Shepard says. ""This dependence means that they will not pick their flight paths at random, they will most likely be using a network of low-cost flyways."" Investigating how movements of the air influence the birds' chosen path will ultimately help them understand how to avoid potential conflict with humans. ""We have a chance to determine the fate of biodiversity."" ""As a world, we have a chance to determine the fate of biodiversity in December at the UN Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change,"" Urban says. ""We can choose to adopt stringent policies that limit this risk."" Scientists also need to develop better, more accurate models for predicting extinction risks that incorporate our complete collective understanding of responses to climate change, he says. Doing that will ensure that we can determine which species are most at risk of extinction — ""and implement conservation strategies to protect them.""",0.5638379103248885,0.4361620896751115,0.7807883049622438,857,5.3337222870478413,433,6.5427251732101617,0,0,"Science, Report"

Although the craft ran out of fuel weeks ago, NASA scientists made the final adjustments to its destructive flight path by venting the helium gas used to pressurize its fuel tanks. The 3-meter-long Messenger became the first spacecraft to crash into Mercury — adding a crater estimated to be five times its size to the planet's pockmarked surface.

Nor is it news that the diet market is lucrative. So of course, our disruptbros have decided this seems like an interesting problem to tackle. The first phase was fitness trackers — devices meant to track how much you move. The idea is simple: by monitoring how little you move and telling you about it, a device can inspire you to move more. Simple. Except that many people who buy these devices don’t use them — 42 percent of the people who start using fitness trackers quit using them within the first six months, according to an NPD report. That hasn’t stopped device makers from trying to move further into tracking behavior with calorie counters. This involves bad science, for reasons His Vladjesty outlined last year: calorie counting is ineffective and gives consumers a false sense of precision in what they’re eating. Even Weight Watchers, the pioneer of calorie counting, has abandoned it. But that message hasn’t made it to the enterprising entrepreneurs of Fitly, who are now trying to crowdfund a plate that weighs your food, pulls calorie and nutrient counts from the USDA, and adds them to a tracker. Calorie counting is ineffective; even Weight Watchers has abandoned itThe plate, which was unveiled on Kickstarter on Monday with a goal of getting $100,000 in backing, is billed as ""the world’s first Wi-Fi- and Bluetooth-enabled hardware device that instantly tracks and analyzes what you eat with the support of a mobile application,"" which is quite a mouthful. When it’s completed, the plate will have three cameras to take photos of the food it’s loaded with, as well as sensors to determine how much that food weighs. Each load sensor can weigh up to 500g individually. The plate snaps a picture, captures the weight, queries the USDA database, and then sends all the information to an Android app. The app also has a scanner that lets users scan in barcodes, in case they don’t have their plates with them when they choose to eat. The real deal will ship in summer 2016, according to the Kickstarter campaign, which already has 58 backers and almost $7,000. I’m not going to rehash the scientific reasons the SmartPlate’s calorie-tracking focus is a bad idea — read Vlad’s post for that. Instead, I’d like to talk about how people actually eat. For starters, we don’t bring our own plates to restaurants. We don't bring our own plates to restaurantsUntil now, Fitly has operated as a food delivery service: for about $20 per person per day, a series of pre-planned meals are brought to your door. The idea here is to help avoid making impulse buys while shopping for healthy food — no Twix at the checkout to sandbag your kale, in other words — and to ensure that even people who haven’t thought much about how to balance a meal can get one. Of course, as anyone who’s ever glanced at a dietary study knows, people cheat on diets all the time — unless they’re closely supervised. A delivery of healthy food to my house is no guarantee I won’t drop by the 7/11 on my walk home to pick up a pint of Ben and Jerry’s. During a demo of the plate prototype, I ask Anthony Ortiz, the CEO of Fitly, how the program can deal with that. ""If you decide to cheat, you’re double spending,"" Ortiz tells me. This is true, but the ready availability of coffee beans in my home hasn’t yet stopped me dropping by a coffee shop from time to time.   The plate is part of Fitly’s goal to build ""an ecosystem,"" Ortiz says. He tells me the important goal is personal accountability — keeping people aware of what they’re eating. The hope, he says, is that once people recognize their bad habits (in his case, eating his girlfriend’s leftovers), they’ll change. ""Awareness drives change,"" he tells me. Food has an important social and bonding role Well, kind of. Owning a scale isn’t the same as losing weight; knowing you have a troubled relationship with food isn’t the same as fixing that relationship. The reason people cheat on diets isn’t that they’re bad or weak or fear commitment — or at least, it’s not just that. It’s also that food has an important social and bonding role. I’ve watched friends who are allergic to gluten tear into birthday cake, knowing full well what digestive consequences it will have for the next several days, simply because they miss being able to eat birthday cake. Or maybe not ""simply,"" maybe also because they want to enjoy the cake just like everyone else at the party. I am on a somewhat restricted diet myself — I’ve been a vegetarian for almost 20 years now — and even that can be isolating: I have more than once been invited to friends’ houses for dinner only to discover that there is nothing I can eat. Well-meaning PR people have hoped to impress me by taking me to a steakhouse, where they find out that I’m interested in salads and Manhattans, not dead cows. Even as someone who’s accustomed to having to explain my weird diet, I cannot imagine bringing my own plate to a restaurant or dinner party. Diets are already isolating The social power of a shared meal is exactly what devices like Fitly’s SmartPlate miss. Diets are already isolating (""No, Grandma, I can’t have the cheesecake you made specifically for this party, I’m dieting! What do you mean, your feelings are hurt?""). With the SmartPlate, whenever you’re invited to a restaurant or dinner party, you have to make a decision: do you want to bring your plate to a meal and risk ridicule, do you want to stay home, or do you want to abandon the plate entirely and eat like a normal person? It’s easier to stick to your diet if you stay home, of course — but that comes at a social cost. Social costs shouldn’t be dismissed lightly. Take teetotalers, for example. Even if you exclude people who are in recovery, non-drinkers tend to die sooner than moderate and heavy-drinking counterparts and are more likely to be depressed. They also make less money. These findings are puzzling — right up until you remember how close you may feel with a colleague you killed a bottle of Four Roses with. We’re social animals, after all — bonding activities are important for our well-being.   The problems with Fitly’s SmartPlate don’t end there. It’s meant to be a home device, one for everyday use. At the demo I saw, the prototype plate wasn’t ready to connect to the USDA; rather, a much thicker cutaway version was used to demonstrate how the technology would work. Ortiz used the prototype to show me how accurate the weight sensors are, with two apples. The first, smaller apple, the plate clocked at 5.7 oz; a food scale showed that its actual weight was 5.708 — not bad. The second apple in the demo weighed in at 11.85 oz on the plate and 11.95 oz on the scale. Better than trying to guess by eyeballing how much the apple weighs, I suppose — but not quite the level of precision one would hope for, even if calorie counting did work. Ortiz used his phone’s camera to take photos of the apples, which the app readily identified. In the planned version of the plate, the cameras will be embedded, he says. Some Brussels sprouts sat nearby, but we did not measure them. Instead, we moved onto bread. A few slices of white bread — one slice is apparently too light for the sensors to notice — were piled up next, then some slices of whole wheat bread. Ortiz asked me if I noticed any differences between the crusts and — to his evident disappointment — I said yes. There were admittedly subtle differences in texture and color, and I suppose I was meant to be impressed when the camera noticed them as well. The device isn't made to address the human problems around eatingThe version of the plate meant to be available for consumers next year isn't dishwasher-safe, and if you — like me — do your dishes once a day, it will require a lot more work in the form of dish washing. The plate also isn’t microwave-safe, but Ortiz suggests using its microwave-safe lid to heat food instead. In other words, the device isn’t made to address the human problems around eating, and it doesn’t save labor, as most successful technology in the home does (think: washing machines, dishwashers, microwaves). The SmartPlate is meant solely to count nutrients, but it struggles even there. That’s because the method of cooking you choose for dinner can shift which nutrients are present. Even assuming those nutrients are measured accurately, though, the way people absorb food varies, based on a number of factors — from what else is in the meal to which microbes inhabit the eater’s guts. Keep your money When a third of the population is obese, it’s worth suggesting that there’s more happening than an abdication of personal responsibility. The major issue with SmartPlate is conceptual: it’s attempting to solve a structural problem through an individual solution. Changing advertising on junk food, limiting agricultural subsidies or reconsidering what foods are worth remaining cheap, addressing food deserts and places where it’s impossible to walk — those things might move the needle on the nation’s obesity rate. But a plate that measures calories and ignores all the human components of food? Keep your money.

That number was a little higher at the high school and college football level, however, where players had a 5 percent and 6 percent chance of sustaining a concussion, respectively. These risk estimates come from the first study to compare the incidence of concussions across the entire range of youth football — that is, for kids between the ages of five and 23. The lowest practice concussion risk was found at the youth level ""The risk of concussion is lowest at the youth level, and increases with each successive level of competition,"" says Thomas Dompier, an epidemiologist at the Datalys Center for Sports Injury and Prevention and a co-author of the study, published in the medical journal JAMA Pediatrics today. Football is one of the most popular youth sports in the US. There are about 3 million youth-level players in the country, whereas high schools and colleges train about 1.1 million and 100,000 football players, respectively. Football provides a number of physical, social, and psychological benefits to players, but it can also be risky. Children and young adults undergo critical brain development at this stage. And a recent — albeit small — study found that ex-NFL players who played tackle football before the age of 12 were more likely to experience thinking and memory problems as adults. That's why it's important to determine the risks that kids are running every time they step onto the football field. In the study, researchers analyzed injury data collected by athletic trainers at youth, high school, and college football levels during both games and practices in 2012 and 2013. They found that concussions accounted for 9.6 percent, 4 percent, and 8 percent of all youth, high school, and college football injuries, respectively. Overall, games posed the highest concussion risk at all levels, but the rate of concussion during games was significantly higher at the college level. Interestingly, the lowest concussion rate during football practice was also found at the college level. ""More can be done at the high school and youth levels to mitigate concussion risk."" These results suggest that ""more can be done at the high school and youth levels to mitigate concussion risk,"" Dompier says. Educating coaches, implementing policies aimed at reducing the amount of full contact drills, and increasing player knowledge of proper tackling technique could help reduce these numbers, he says. The study, which was partly funded by USA Football — the governing body for amateur football — and the NCAA, used data collected from thousands of players across the US. Still, it's possible that it underestimates the number of concussions sustained during 2012 and 2013, especially those at the youth level. One potential issue lies with the risk calculation; it was calculated by dividing the number of players who sustained at least one concussion by the number of players who started the season. But kids drop out of sports all the time — especially at a young age. This means that the overall risk may be higher than the study  indicates. The risk may actually be higher than the study indicates In addition, all injuries were recorded by athletic trainers, which means that the injury reports were largely dependent on a trainer’s experience. Coaches who are less experienced may not be as good as detecting the signs of a concussion compared with coaches who have been working with youth for a long time, the authors note. This is most apparent in the five to seven age range, where no concussions were reported. Sure, it’s possible that these kids actually sustained zero concussions during two seasons. But it’s also possible that very young children aren’t taught to recognize and report their symptoms.  Trainers may also be less skilled at recognizing the symptoms of a concussion in young kids. Still, athletic trainers appear to be getting better at recognizing concussions. The rate of concussions in youth football players recorded in this study was higher than the rate that Dompier recorded in a comparable 2007 study. This suggests that coaches at that level are getting better at detecting and reporting concussions. ""I believe this may be reflective of educational efforts to inform players, coaches, and parents on the signs and symptoms of concussion,"" he says. The rates observed at the high school and collegiate level were comparable to previous studies, however.  Female sports ""have been underrepresented in the literature.""  Dompier and his team aren't just interested in football; they are currently  replicating this study in boys and girls youth lacrosse. They also just completed a study that looked at the effectiveness of policy changes and coach education in reducing injury risk and head impact exposure in youth football; it will be published soon, Dompier says. Despite these efforts, there's a lot more work to be done in this area, notably in female sports, which ""have been underrepresented in the literature,"" Dompier says. The researchers hope to make similar comparisons across the entire spectrum of youth in other boys and girls sports, such as soccer, ice hockey, and basketball.",0.6452822487550194,0.3547177512449806,0.6693185603904239,875,5.1302857142857139,388,6.2654639175257731,1,0,"Science, Report"

A small loss, and one Craig McNamara could have easily missed during his orchard inspection in June. But come July, the tree lost a few more. By August, it was dead. Botryosphaeria, the fungal disease that took it, has now spread to nearly every tree on McNamara’s 450-acre organic farm, many as old as 55 years. Farmers call it ""bot"" for short, and it’s diffusing through McNamara’s orchards on the heels of a tiny insect called the walnut scale. Unfortunately for California growers, the drought, combined with the warmest winter in the state’s history, have made conditions ripe for the unwelcome disease, along with plenty of other agricultural pests. ""I never heard of it until last year,"" says McNamara, who’s been tending his Sierra Orchard farm for 34 years.   Scale is the size of a Rice Krispie. It spends its life sucking the juice from the flesh of a twig, then forms a small scale over the area, before repeating the process. The insect leaves behind thousands of eggs under that scaly patch that hatch, grow into crawlers, and continue the deadly cycle — one that has grown worse with drought. Lack of moisture, including the Central Valley’s vanishing tule fog, fuels the problem by stressing trees, making them more susceptible to insects. In 2013, California’s six top produce crops (almonds, grapes, strawberries, walnuts, lettuce, and tomatoes) were valued at $18.3 billion dollars. While the State Department of Food and Agriculture does not keep statistics on crop damage done by insects, even a 10 percent associated loss would be substantial for growers. And many farmers say they’re now seeing pests earlier in the season and in greater numbers. Lygus bugs, beet armyworms, potato psyllids, aphids, thrips — every crop has its pest, but growers and scientists say the drought is triggering a change in insect behavior, producing a boon of bugs at a time when farmers are already wringing their hands over the very future of their crops. The burst of bugs is something John Trumble, an entomologist at University of California-Riverside, predicted in a 2009 paper, ""Climate change will exacerbate California’s insect pest problems."" In it, Trumble warns that warming temperatures could prove a boon for insects: existing pests may expand their range, and new bugs may make California their home. ""The [current] increase is mostly related to the drought, which may in fact be related to climate change,"" says Trumble. ""Insects are nothing if not adaptable."" Joe Pezzini, chief operating officer of Ocean Mist Farms in Castroville, says it’s the plume moth that has him most concerned. With nearly 5,000 acres in production, Ocean Mist is the largest artichoke producer in North America. About half the crop is made up of annual varieties. The other half is planted with an heirloom perennial that came from Europe nearly 100 years ago. Its rootstock can stay in the ground for a decade or more. ""We're getting two more generations per year than we had before. generations [of plume moths] are overlapping."" Plume moths bore into an artichoke like a worm in an apple. It typically takes six to eight weeks to go from egg to moth, but dry, warm weather, including several 80-degree days in January and February, have accelerated the moth’s life cycle; the plume moths are maturing in four to six weeks, according to Pezzini. ""That means we’re getting two more generations per year than we had before,"" says Pezzini. ""Generations of them are overlapping."" To handle the growing number of plume moths, Ocean Mist uses spray or traps to eradicate them, and has even resorted to chopping their valuable perennial varieties to the ground, leaving the root intact. The idea, says Pezzini, is to reduce the foliage in the hopes of slowing the moth down. Lack of rainfall is prompting insects to migrate. Hillsides that typically would stay green until April are already dry. Low rainfall amounts and low seed germination have pushed bugs, like the voracious beet armyworm, from the California hillsides into agricultural fields. ""Farmers are seeing them much earlier than they would have because native plants have been desiccated, and they’re showing up in fields at a time when growers are not used to seeing them,"" says Trumble. That’s the scenario that’s playing out at Terranova Ranch, Don Cameron’s farm 30 miles southwest of Fresno, where he grows more than 20 different crops ranging from wine grapes to canning tomatoes to carrots and onions. Sugar beet leafhoppers may sound like a endearing bug dreamed up by Pixar, but they carry the beet curly top virus, devastating to sugar beet and tomato crops. ""It just takes one bite."" ""Tomatoes aren’t their favorite crop, but it just takes one bite into the tomato to transmit the virus and the plant dies,"" Cameron says. ""We’re hearing reports of the South Valley being infected with curly top virus from the sugar beet leafhoppers — we’re just keeping our fingers crossed it doesn’t turn into a serious problem."" The bug-related virus devastated Cameron’s canning tomato crop in 2013, when the region had already reached severe drought status. Yield in his organic fields dropped from 50 tons per acre to 12 tons, and his conventional tomatoes were hit with a 10–15 percent loss as well. There has been an upside to the warm weather, though. Plenty of farmers, including Cameron, have planted crops weeks earlier than normal. His wine grapes are two weeks ahead of schedule. Tomato transplants placed in fields in early March usually run the risk of frost. Not this year. And crops like strawberries have done well this year, with some regions harvesting as early as five weeks ahead of their normal schedule. ""We're not going to let the insects take our crops."" But Cameron says this year he’s keeping a close watch for insect swells that threaten his fields. ""The insects are cycling faster than they used to. We’re having multiple generations and a longer growing season,"" he says. ""We’ve got to be vigilant. We’re not going to let the insects take our crops.""

The data also showed that emoji were more popular among female users, with ""haha"" showing a small male bias, and ""hehe"" distributed nearly evenly among the genders.

Two graphs showing laughter preference by age (left) and by gender (right). (Facebook) Facebook's data team also examined how users deployed variants of these laughter terms, looking at whether they hehe'd more than they hehehehe'd, for example. An article in The New Yorker that inspired Facebook's analysis suggested that we use ""ha""s and ""he""s as building blocks, adding up these lexical units to convey everything from polite recognition (""ha"") to no-really-I'm-going-a-bit-mad-with-laughter (""hahahahahahahaha""). Although interpretation of these different strings can be quite subjective, Facebook's data showed that even letter counts were more common than odd ones, suggesting that we do indeed stack up these two-letter phonemes like Lego bricks ""The lol almost always stands by itself, though some rare specimens were found."" As Facebook's researchers explain: ""The most common are the four-letter hahas and hehes. The six-letter hahaha is also very common, and in general, the haha-ers use longer laughter. The haha-ers are also slightly more open than the hehe-ers to using odd number of letters, and we do see the occasional hahaas and hhhhaaahhhaas. The lol almost always stands by itself, though some rare specimens of lolz and loll were found. A single emoji is used 50 percent of the time, and it's quite rare to see people use more than five identical consecutive emoji."" However, Facebook's data scientists should probably look at Instagram, where long strings of Face With Tears Of Joy emoji are more common. And judging by the demographics of the two social networks, this is how laughter online is likely to look in the future.

""But we won't be enabling that for users with this hardware suite, because we don't think it's likely to be safe in suburban neighborhoods,"" he said, noting that such streets often lack posted speed limit signs and pose obstacles like children playing in the street. In the future, drivers will be able to summon an unmanned Model S to their location or direct the car to drive itself into a garage. Musk noted that these features remain illegal on most US roads, so he cautioned that drivers will be restricted to using them on private property. He also made clear that autopilot isn't to be confused with a proper self-driving car. ""There’s certainly an expectation that when autopilot on the Model S is enabled, that you’re paying attention.

Bas Lansdorp is the CEO of Mars One, a company that's running a competition with the goal of establishing a human settlement on Mars by 2025. The project has faced much scrutiny since its announcement in 2012, but this week an interview with one of the final 100 candidates for the mission has sparked a debate about whether or not Mars One is a scam. Lansdorp has finally addressed some of the issues online and in a video published to Mars One's YouTube account. ""The suggestion was made that our candidates were selected on the basis of how much money they donate to Mars One, and that's just simply untrue,"" he says. He goes on to accuse Elmo Keep, the author of the accusatory piece, of making false claims about how the contest works. He specifically says the claim that contest participants were able to pay for a better chance to be selected was ""simply a lie."" ""She is more interested in writing a sensational article about Mars One."" ""We offered Elmo Keep as the first journalist ever to have access to our list of 200,000 applications,"" Lansdorp says. ""She was not interested in that, so it seems to me she is more interested in writing a sensational article about Mars One than in the truth."" Mars One has also released a written interview on its website that covers the same issues, though the references to Keep have been cut. Lansdorp's answers address things like losing the company's broadcast partner (the goal from the beginning has been to turn the entire project into a reality television show), how he expects to receive funding for the mission, and how he will vet the mission's final candidates. He doesn't, however, address the technical issues that Mars One has been criticized for. He also says that the company's milestone goals — landing a rover on Mars, cargo missions, and the eventual crewed missions — have all been delayed by two years. As of now, the company's plan wouldn't get humans to the red planet until 2027.

It’s friendly, almost conversational, were it not for the monotonous whirring of a strange motor in the background. “Please, go ahead,” it says again. It’s telling me that it’s safe to cross in front of it, I believe, so I can get in on the other side. There is no sense of urgency or impatience. This machine isn’t subject to emotion, to the frightening cocktail of testosterone and adrenaline that beget the tragically human phenomenon of road rage. Mercedes-Benz couldn’t have picked a more appropriate venue to demonstrate the F 015 Luxury in Motion, a distant-future vision of what a fully autonomous car could eventually look like. We’re standing with a group of other journalists at one end of a dilapidated runway at the Alameda Naval Air Station, a vast expanse of concrete and weeds that has remained essentially unchanged since the military base’s closure in 1997. Enormous transoceanic freighters glide by in the channel a few hundred feet to the north, backdropped by the hazy silhouette of San Francisco’s skyline several miles away. MythBusters is known to film here, because you can have an explosion or a crash go horribly wrong and it doesn’t really matter. It’s basically a scene from Mad Max. If there’s a place in America where I might expect a car to wean itself off humans and start talking to them, this is it. Before the F 015 has a chance to ask me once again, I dart in front of it. I don’t know what an autonomous car sounds like when it gets frustrated with a pedestrian, but I don’t care to find out. Mercedes debuted the F 015 not at Detroit’s North American International Auto Show in January, but at CES the week prior. That is to say, Mercedes announced its most exciting project in years not on the auto industry’s biggest stage, but on technology’s. That speaks volumes about what this vehicle really is. As I chat with Vera Schmidt, a user interface designer who works out of Mercedes’ Silicon Valley R&D center, she calls the F 015 a concept car, then catches and corrects herself. ""It’s a research car, not a concept car,"" she says. Concept cars often foreshadow an automaker’s design direction, which is always a primary topic of conversation at international auto shows; the F 015, on the other hand, is basically a rolling laboratory. Today, most autonomous driving projects imagine a near future that’s tethered to the technological and political realities of the present: here’s a car that looks like any other car on the road, and oh, by the way, it can drive itself sometimes.  With the F 015, Mercedes says that it freed itself of those constraints and just kind of went crazy. Let’s assume, just for the hell of it, that we’ve completely solved the bureaucratic nightmare that awaits us when cars drive themselves. Let’s assume that driverless cars are culturally accepted. Let’s assume that the technology is perfected and we’ve made it small enough to fit into a tiny compartment inside a regular road-going car. (Of these assumptions, that last one’s the safest.) Google is approaching self-driving research in a similar manner, but the end goal is different: whereas Google wants to make a little box that efficiently gets you from Point A to Point B, Mercedes is still trying to make something that evokes an emotional response, just as well-designed cars do today. Basically, here’s a car company’s interpretation of a car in a post-driver world. When you don’t have to drive, you don’t have to look away from the people you’re riding with The F 015 doesn’t really communicate ""beautiful"" through its design — at least not by any present-day standard. But it definitely communicates ""future."" Holger Hutzenlaub, who runs Mercedes’ Advanced Design department, jokes that the F 015’s internal codename was ""Led Zeppelin,"" noting subtle cues, like the placement of the GPS antenna hump on the roof, that help visually differentiate front from rear. (It’s not a stretch to suggest that the car looks a bit like a flightless dirigible.) He gestures to a board of sketches showing the car’s evolution over several years of internal iteration; the final concept is substantially different from the very earliest designs, but one thing remains constant: the carriage-like cabin, allowing four people to face each other. Rear suicide doors and the absence of B-pillars — the strips of metal that normally divide the front and rear passenger compartments of a car — leave a cavernous hole in each side of the F 015 for easy entrance and exit from the swiveling seats. Maybe in 20 or 30 years, this will be the defining element of an autonomous car; when you don’t have to drive, you don’t have to look away from the people you’re riding with. Everything about the F 015 is automated, or at least gives the appearance of being automated — the car is summoned by a smartphone app, opens and closes its doors automatically, and gently urges nearby pedestrians (like me) to ""please, go ahead."" In reality, the car was continually being attended to by a substantial fleet of Mercedes engineers brought in from Germany and Silicon Valley, babying it as if it was made of papier mâché. Currently, the F 015 isn’t even fully autonomous — it needs arrays of beacons on the surrounding pavement to define its path. And after each group of four went on the short, closed-course trip, there was a full inspection and a reset of the car’s internals. Several emphasized to me that the car is ""sensitive,"" reacting poorly to rain and extreme heat. They made it sound, ironically, almost human. The car is ""sensitive,"" reacting poorly to rain and extreme heat On my first trip in the F 015, I climbed in with two fellow journalists and Thomas Jäger, a concept engineer at Mercedes. Even approaching this car is a theatrical event: the LED array in the grill glows blue to indicate that it recognizes your presence, a feature designed to give pedestrians some degree of assurance that this two-ton automaton isn’t about to run you over. A high-intensity laser mounted beneath the car’s badge can project symbols onto the road, including a green crosswalk, of sorts — another sign that it’s safe to walk in front of the car. Mercedes is really playing up the F 015’s ability to be a good citizen in dense spaces filled with people, pets, other cars, and general urban chaos, hyper-aware of its surroundings. If it says ""please, go ahead"" and you want to respond with ""no, I insist, you go ahead,"" you can even make a waving motion at the car and it’ll drive on by. The interior of the car is starkly different from its exterior. From the outside, with its opaque, metallic windows, Hutzenlaub says the F 015 almost seems ""mysterious"" — is there anyone even driving this thing? — but the cabin is a mixture of wood, leather, polished aluminum, and giant touchscreens basically everywhere they could possibly fit. There’s a big display embedded in each of the four doors, one across the entire dashboard, another behind the rear passengers, and one more on a floor-mounted console that can automatically extend into a table. The décor is still cold, but it’s an inviting kind of cold, not a ""metallic zeppelin of unknown provenance"" kind of cold. The décor is cold, but it’s an inviting kind of cold In a traditional car, this amount of digital stimulation would be criminally distracting: gently undulating patterns move in sync across the displays, which can be manipulated to control music, take phone calls, and even see live views from the exterior cameras of nearby F 015 drivers you’ve befriended. (There’s no way this privacy nightmare would ever make it to a production vehicle, I’d wager — even in the distant future.) But when a car is in complete control of itself, the passengers need as many distractions as they can get. The display in the retractable table could have games on it, for instance, although it didn’t have any loaded yet. Without warning or fanfare, the F 015 starts moving. The windows that look like sheets of metal from the outside are actually see-through once you’re inside, but the views seem intentionally deemphasized; there’s a sense that they’re smaller than they could have been, because the focus is on the LCD displays and the people you share the cabin with. The coating that gives the windows their metallic sheen interferes a bit, too — they’re tinted by a pattern running across them. It’s a bit like looking through a vinyl wrap. If there was something pretty outside, this wouldn’t be the car you’d want to be in. I asked Schmidt why Mercedes didn’t use windows that could be dimmed electrostatically — clear when you want to see outside, opaque when you want to take a nap and let the car do its thing. She said they’d considered it, but they’d wanted to also embed displays in the windows, and the technology simply wasn’t there yet. Is this really the future of transportation? But even without next-gen digital windows, the F 015 still has interactive displays everywhere, unavoidable in any line of sight. Is this really the future of transportation? Will we stop having any sense of where we are right now, turning our attention instead to work, games, reading, or the passengers around us? The notion of blocking out the outside world during a commute feels uniquely Californian to me — again, Mercedes has a lab in Silicon Valley — because the gridlock is legendary here. If you can look at a sunset or a beach or a portrait of your family instead of the bumper of the guy ahead of you, maybe you’re living a less stressful life. Nothing about the interior was perfect, but I wasn’t expecting it to be: it’s a hodgepodge of ideas that are fleshed out just enough to test, to gauge reaction. The touchscreens were fidgety, the fit and finish weren’t great, and the car sounded really weird — a continuous drone from a fan that never changed pitch. The seats, which rotate to help you get in and out of the car, would occasionally rotate for no obvious reason. Of course, I can probably name two dozen ways this car isn’t street legal, too. As functional non-production cars go, the F 015 is minimally functional. (To its credit, Jäger tells me they’ve taken it up to 200 km/h — 124 mph — but we never get anywhere near that out here at Alameda.) As functional non-production cars go, the F 015 is minimally functional At some point on our lackadaisical, figure-eight trip up and down the airstrip, the car came to an abrupt halt, as if it detected something was wrong. Jäger, Secret Service-style earpiece in his ear, waited for word from the army of engineers nearby. The pause, the hush that filled the cabin, was long enough for a bit of reflection. ""The last two years, this car has been my life,"" he said. His English is perfectly understandable, but he suddenly apologizes profusely for it, insisting that he’s out of practice. There’s a moment where he seems to get a little emotional, frustrated by a language barrier that prevents him from fully articulating the motivations behind the project that has completely consumed him. And right then, there was this surreal feeling where four people were in this car, this teardrop-shaped transportation pod, sharing a moment. We were facing each other, surrounded by displays and a post-apocalyptic backdrop, trusting technology completely to take us to our destination. There was no concern for the car or the road. We were focused on Jäger, and he was focused on us.     After a while, he spun his chair around, deployed the telescoping steering wheel, and took manual control of the car. ""You’re the only group to see this,"" I heard him say. He was driving a little more aggressively than the car drove itself, apologizing for the unexpected detour as we arrived back at the starting point. As far as I’m concerned, it was better to see both modes in operation: the F 015’s steering wheel isn’t just for show. One of Mercedes’ Italy-based interior designers, Till Varailhon, tells me that the company’s self-driving cars will always have steering wheels; driving manually is part of the emotional connection with a car, and you certainly can’t drive manually without a steering wheel. I left Alameda no more convinced that I ever want a fully autonomous car in my life than when I arrived. But regardless, the F 015 definitely imparts a broader perspective for what fully autonomous driving could mean someday: it’s not just about reducing accidents and taking away control of two-ton death machines, as Elon Musk would say. You’ve got this reclaimed time that you can use, and this research car is trying to figure out how you might use it. In recent days, Mercedes has been driving the F 015 around locations in San Francisco, letting the public get close to it, taking selfies, asking questions. As the company flashes through a slideshow of the gathered throngs, there’s clearly curiosity, if not outright interest. Legalizing a car that disengages drivers this far from their cars will take Herculean effort spread over many years — but winning hearts and minds probably isn’t a bad place to start. It’s a 2030 concept, after all, and even that might be a little aggressive. In 15 years, we’ll know whether we’ve untangled a rat’s nest of automotive bureaucracy, whether people are okay with being shuttled around by artificial intelligence alone, and whether real cars of the future are this pleasant with hesitating pedestrians. ""Please, go ahead,"" I heard it say as another group got ready to approach the car. Not a hint of exasperation yet.

Giger, the Swiss surrealist artist best known for designing the iconic ""xenomorph"" creature in the Alien movie franchise, has died. Swiss newspaper Tages-Anzeiger reports that the news comes from public broadcaster SRF, which said Giger died after sustaining injuries in a fall. He was 74. Giger was born in Chur, Switzerland in 1940, later studying architecture and industrial design at Zurich's School of Applied Arts. He developed a freehand airbrush painting style that he used to great effect in his ""biomechanical"" landscape artworks, and was tapped to work on Alejandro Jodorowsky's ambitious, doomed remake of Dune in 1975, but Giger gained a new level of recognition following the publication of his book Necronomicon in 1977. It was that book that inspired Ridley Scott in the pre-production phases of Alien, and Scott hired Giger to produce concept art for the film. The Alien creature was based on a Giger print named ""Necronom IV"", and marked a major departure from the clichéd green men often seen in movies until then. Giger's alien was androgynous, eyeless, and insectoid, playing off the artist's prior exploration of what he called biomechanical themes. Its design also had a clear sexual subtext, with its phallic head and disturbing reproductive system; the crab-like ""facehugger"" form wraps itself around a victim's head, impregnating it so the infant alien can burst out of the chest. Giger continued to work on the Alien franchise, but his art found its way into corners of pop culture as diverse as the video game Dark Seed, the cover of Debbie Harry's solo album Koo Koo, and Korn singer Jonathan Davis' microphone stand.

As a result, a number of American cities and states — such as San Francisco and Minnesota — have adopted building standards that promote bird safety, such as special lighting conditions. Unfortunately, many architects are reluctant to make changes if it means obstructing a client's view by using things like semi-transparent window decals. So, as The New York Times reports, an increasing number of glass companies and research labs have started to think about ways to stop these deadly collisions, without hindering our view. ""Almost anybody you talk to has seen a bird hit a building or heard a bird hit,"" Christine Sheppard, a bird collisions campaign manager with the American Bird Conservancy, told NPR. Birds don't have very good depth perception, she said, so reflections in a glass window can make it seem like there isn't a window there at all. ""glass companies realize there's a market for bird-friendly products."" One idea that's being tested out by researchers at Fordham University is to see if adding thin white and black vertical stripes to windows can deter birds from crashing into them. When birds enter wind tunnels partially blocked by striped glass during experiments, they tend to avoid the stripes. Another idea — one that is both less obtrusive and much more expensive — comes from European Glass manufacturer Arnold Glas. The company has come up with a patterned, ultraviolet reflective coating that has the advantage of being almost transparent to the human eye, while still being detectable by incoming birds. ""Suddenly glass companies realize there's a market for bird-friendly products,"" Sheppard told The New York Times. But it's not just the windows themselves that are causing problems — it's also how they're used. Large mirror-like building facades, for instance, are especially hazardous to migrating birds. So Fordham University researchers are also trying to figure out just how much space they can put between the stripes on large pieces of glass. If they can find the ""sweet spot"" — one that will please architects and repel birds — the stripes will go a long way to curbing these accidental avian deaths.",0.3886821007957483,0.6113178992042517,0.7358098471215365,379,5.1451187335092348,245,5.8857142857142861,0,0,"Design, Science"

The biggest change is one net neutrality advocates have been pushing for and internet providers have been lambasting for the past several months. Broadband internet will be reclassified under Title II of the Telecommunications Act. Wheeler argues this is the best way to ensure the agency can ban paid prioritization of traffic and the blocking or throttling of data from lawful sites. But supporters and opponents of this move agree that the issue is far from settled and is likely to quickly end up in court. ""Reclassification will endanger further investment in America’s superior networks."" The ISPs have been preparing for this battle. Verizon, for example, wrote in November that ""the key to whether there is further litigation is the statutory basis the FCC chooses as the foundation for its new rules."" The company, along with Comcast and AT&T, argues that Title II would be far too onerous and that ""reclassification will endanger further investment in America’s superior networks."" ""It will provide the FCC a solid legal foundation to enact net neutrality rules, as well as ensuring that the FCC retains authority it needs in select areas,"" said John Bergmayer, a senior staff attorney at the think tank, Public Knowledge. ""Title II is easier to defend in court than alternate legal theories, but that said, many controversial FCC actions get challenged.  Look at a blog post AT&T put on its policy blog yesterday, where it writes about 'when' the FCC has to defend itself in court, not 'if' it has to."" That blog post, entitled ""Title II Closing Arguments,"" was written Hank Hultquist, a vice president of regulatory affairs for AT&T. He lays out his case against Title II before concluding, ""As I said, I have no illusions that any of this will change what happens on February 26th. But when the FCC has to defend reclassification before an appellate court, it will have to grapple with these and other arguments. Those who oppose efforts at compromise because they assume Title II rests on bulletproof legal theories are only deceiving themselves."" ""It is likely the FCC will ultimately lose in court — yet again."" Industry analysts with a pro-ISP bent also gave the FCC slim chances. ""Nationally, it would be a reversal and repudiation of decades of bipartisan Congressional and FCC consensus to not subject 'data' or computer services (i.e. the internet) to 1934 common carrier regulation,"" said Scott Cleland, chairman of NetCompetition, an e-forum supported by broadband interests. ""Since the FCC is already 0-2 in court on this matter, and the FCC will be trying to reverse decades of FCC precedents and many FCC findings of facts, it is likely the FCC will ultimately lose in court — yet again."" Under the new proposal, the FCC will treat the contentious issues of peering and interconnection as part of Title II.  ""This will allow the FCC jurisdiction over the internet and the interconnection between networks,  which is really the place where ISPs have been distorting traffic and limiting consumers' ability to access certain websites and services,"" said Dave Schaeffer, CEO of Cogent Communications. ""With Title II, the FCC has a very clear and defensible position. All the courts have to conclude is that some portion of the internet is used a communication service."" ""With Title II, the FCC has a very clear and defensible position."" The new proposal from the FCC was precipitated by the agency's losses in court to Comcast and Verizon. At the time, the agency was trying to hedge its authority without drawing too deeply on Title II. That was poor strategy, and while the judge agreed with the FCC's position, ultimately he ruled against them based on the agency's poor legal standing. Today Wheeler decided to state the obvious, that these networks are just the modern-day versions of the telecommunication networks the FCC has long had the power to closely regulate. It remains to be seen if the courts will agree. But the FCC should have a better chance this time. As we reported last year, even Verizon has described itself as a Title II common carrier when it was building out the fiber for its FioS internet service. And behind closed doors it has tried to reassure investors that, contrary to public statements, Title II actually wouldn't hurt investment at all.",0.3452818760396657,0.6547181239603344,0.8123515331001983,758,4.9960422163588394,402,6.2810945273631837,0,0,"Business, Policy & Law, Tech, US & World, Report"

GoPro's own forecast called for earnings between 65 to 69 cents a share on revenue between $550 million and $580 million.

GoPro is not naming a replacement, with Woodman saying that he'd handle COO duties with GoPro president Tony Bates and chief financial officer Jack Lazar.  GoPro introduced new models of its Hero cameras in September, putting them on sale in October (which is when this quarter began). Notable in that lineup was the addition of a $129 entry-level model, opening up GoPro's products to a wider range of buyers. GoPro also made its lower-tiered Silver model surprisingly attractive versus its top-of-the-line Black version by adding a touchscreen display.

""It's no secret and the rest of the world talks about it every day. We lose core user after core user by not addressing simple trolling issues that they face every day."" ""It's nobody's fault but mine."" Costolo's comments came in response to a question on an internal forum about a recent story by Lindy West, a frequent target of harassment on Twitter. Among other things, West's tormentors created a Twitter account for her then recently deceased father and made cruel comments about her on the service; West recently shared her story on This American Life and The Guardian. On Twitter's forums, an employee asked whether anything could be done: Costolo later sent a follow-up message reiterating that he was taking responsibility for Twitter's slowness in addressing the problem.   Amid widespread criticism, Twitter released some tools to improve its notoriously arduous process for reporting abuse in December. In November, Twitter partnered with an advocacy group called WAM! to investigate harassment against women. But every day, Twitter users still face threats of physical violence, sexual abuse, and stalking — all forms of harassment that disproportionately affect women online, according to data from The Pew Center. Twitter users face death threats every day Just last week, feminist critic Anita Sarkeesian documented the harassment she received on Twitter from January 20th to the 26th. You'll have to scroll for awhile before you hit the end of tweets containing gendered insults, victim blaming, incitement to suicide, sexual violence, and rape and death threats. Sarkessian was a top target for Gamergate predators because of her criticism of the way women are portrayed in video games, and her post shows that the vile intimidation campaign against her continues unabated. Gamergate is only the latest and loudest example of harassment. Robin Williams' daughter, Zelda Williams, left the service last August because of the disturbing images and attacks she received after her father's suicide. Advocates have offered numerous suggestions for fixing the problem, including improving responsiveness to reports and better blocking tools. Twitter's fourth quarter earnings call is scheduled for tomorrow afternoon. They'll have plenty of new initiatives to discuss, including their new tie-up with Google, which was revealed today. But given Costolo's acknowledgement that trolls are costing Twitter users, expect him to get some questions about his plans for dealing with abuse now as well.

He argued that companies like Comcast and AT&T were creating an artificial bottleneck that was degrading Netflix service, causing customers' video to bugger. Hastings called on the FCC to expand the definition of net neutrality to cover this little-known world of ""interconnection"" between networks. The FCC has radically changed course Today, the FCC did just that. ""For the first time the commission would have authority to hear complaints and take appropriate enforcement action if necessary, if it determines the interconnection activities of ISPs are not just and  reasonable, thus allowing it to address issues that may arise in the exchange of traffic between mass-market broadband providers and edge providers."" This is actually a fairly radical departure from the way the FCC has operated in the past, and even from its own statements last year. In April, an FCC spokesperson told National Journal, ""Peering and interconnection are not under consideration in the Open Internet proceeding, but we are monitoring the issues involved to see if any action is needed in any other context."" So what changed? Companies like Netflix — along with the companies that carry their traffic, like Cogent and Level 3 — have been making their case with blog posts on the web and closed door meetings in Washington DC. Of course so have the ISPs. In the court of public opinion, however, it was clear who was winning. Netflix's complaint became the central data point in a long segment by John Oliver that went viral. Peering and interconnection make the average person glaze over, but ""Cable industry fuckery"" is something the masses can rally against. Commenters responded in such numbers that the FCC website crashed.  Cable industry fuckery is something the masses can rally against The FCC doesn't go into any detail about what it will do with its new authority around interconnection, and this expansion of powers will no doubt be challenged in court. On today's press call, senior FCC officials said that they would handle interconnection complaints on a case-by-case basis, and the new proposal allows ""reasonable network management,"" a term which the ISPs have already been using to justify congestion at interconnection points. ""A handful of ISPs opted to hold our members hostage until we paid up."" But advocates for expanded net neutrality hailed the decision as a victory. ""The commission initially stated they [net neutrality and interconnection] were different. But as they studied the issue, I think they realized ISPs were using them to thwart the intent of the commission,"" said Dave Schaeffer, the CEO of Cogent Communications. ""Interconnection is critical to meet the objectives of an open and free internet the FCC and President Obama laid out."" Netflix has already agreed to pay the major ISPs for direct interconnection. But following today's proposal, it sounds like they are eager to renegotiate. ""We support the commission asserting jurisdiction over interconnection and implementing a case-by-case process that prevents ISPs from charging unfair and unreasonable tolls,"" Netflix said in a statement emailed to The Verge. ""If such an oversight process had been in place last year, we certainly would've used it when a handful of ISPs opted to hold our members hostage until we paid up.""",0.5492586482099272,0.4507413517900728,0.8604797892709216,577,5.1958405545927207,339,6.171091445427729,0,0,"Business, Policy & Law, Tech, US & World, Report"

""We are able to ‘find’ Silicon Valley."" ""There’s a lot of interest in entrepreneurship"" in the US, says Scott Stern, an economist at MIT and a co-author of the study published in Science today. ""And one of the key implications of our study is that we started disentangling the difference between simply starting a new business, and the kind of new businesses that have the potential for significant job creation and growth."" Based on the researchers' model, the best indicators of entrepreneurial quality were characteristics like a company's name. Companies that have short names containing words associated with technology tend to grow better. Businesses that aren’t named after their founders also tend to do better over time. In addition, the model showed that corporations are six times more likely to do well compared with companies that aren't incorporated. The same goes for trademarks; companies with trademarks are five times more likely to grow than nontrademarked businesses. Patents are also important indicators of entrepreneurial quality, Stern says. ""We basically combined the novel use of getting at the details from a business registration with a predictive algorithm.""   Silicon Valley, according to Google Maps     San Francisco Bay Area map of estimated entrepreneurial quality by ZIP code. (credit: RJ Andrew) The researchers were also able to map entrepreneurial quality for each ZIP code in California. The resulting map presents a continuous mass of ""high quality"" entrepreneurship in the south of the San Francisco Bay Area, that goes from just east of Google to Millbrae and Burlingame, as well as in the area around Market Street in San Francisco, and close to Berkeley and Lawrence Livermore Labs. ""This provides a unique characterization of Silicon Valley,"" says Jorge Guzman, an economist at MIT and a co-author of the study. Thanks to this method, ""we are able to ‘find’ Silicon Valley."" Moreover, the economists found that areas around research centers — around universities like UCLA and Caltech, for instance — tend to present small pockets of entrepreneurial quality. ""And thats kind of a novel finding,"" Stern says. Others have attempted to measure entrepreneurship in the past, but they mostly did that by looking at the number of new businesses that popped up in a given area, Stern says. ""There has never been a consistent, realtime method that would allow someone to distinguish between types of companies in a systematic way."" That said, the characteristics identified in the study aren’t supposed to provide an explanation for a given company’s success. They are merely indicators of entrepreneurial quality, he says — ""it’s not a causal relationship."" ""There has never been a consistent, realtime method... to distinguish between types of companies in a systematic way."" To reach these conclusions, Guzman and Stern identified new business registrants that appeared in California  between 2001 and 2011. Of those startups, they removed those that were headquartered outside California. Then, they took 70 percent of the companies and coded each of them for a series indicators, including whether or not the companies had patents and how a company’s name was constructed. Using that information, they developed a model that asks what initial characteristics are present in companies that end up having ""meaningful growth outcomes"" within six years of foundation, meaning companies that are acquired by other businesses or that go through an initial public offering in a fairly short amount of time. Businesses that aren’t named after their founders do better Developing the model and identifying these indicators wasn’t enough, however; the researchers had to test the model to make sure it was accurate. To do that, they took the remaining 30 percent of their startup pool, and applied their algorithm based on how those companies looked when they were founded. This gave the researchers an initial quality score. Then they looked at what happened to those companies six years down the line. They found that 75 percent of the firms that were acquired by another company or that went through an IPO within six years of their foundation had received an initial ""top-tier"" quality score. Stern says the algorithm is a very good predictor of how companies grow. The model developed by Stern and Guzman is limited by the fact that it relies on external characteristics, however — indicators that outsiders can quantify. All the stuff that’s going on under a company’s hood remains hidden from the algorithm.   Los Angeles Basin map of estimated entrepreneurial quality by ZIP Code.

The color of each bubble varies with the percentile distribution according to the scale at the bottom. Each row is a distinct geographic region in California. (Credit: RJ Andrews) Stern says that he plans to look at other states. The researchers would also like to identify other indicators of entrepreneurial quality. For example, they would like to know what role venture capital — early-stage funding — plays in entrepreneurial quality. The economists will also investigate if crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter participate in translating initial entrepreneurial quality into long-term growth. ""Finally, we can examine the impact of various other aspects of founders of companies on growth outcomes,"" Stern says. ""For example, there are differences between men and women, differences in terms of sector, and in terms of people who have been founders before, versus people who haven’t."" Once it's perfected, the method will ""provide policy makers with the ability to track and assess their efforts to enhance entrepreneurial ecosystems in a new way,"" Stern says. Municipalities and states that want to increase entrepreneurship need to get a pulse on what’s happening in their area, Stern says — and this work could help them do just that.",0.6874172792490841,0.31258272075091587,0.8610169078851458,1041,5.3064361191162348,479,6.4279749478079333,0,8,"Business, Science, Tech, US & World, Report"

During the trial, the drones will only deliver orders of a specific type of ginger tea, a restriction that BBC News says keeps the maximum weight of the packages to 340g (12oz). The 450 shoppers involved in the trial will also need to live within a one-hour flight of Alibaba's distribution centers in order to receive their goods. The drones will only deliver a specific type of tea during the trial The company's drone trial is the latest in a list of challenges to Western tech and retail giants like Google and Amazon, as Alibaba continues its push to globalize. Alibaba CEO Jack Ma said his company aimed to have 2 billion customers by 2025, and it has adopted some of the methods used by Western tech giants in order to reach that goal. Last month, the company announced it was making a movie with established director Wong Kar-wai, following a similar path to Amazon by creating exclusive entertainment content it could push on its platforms.

By the time the water's boiled, Alibaba's drone has arrived, and her notable frown is turned upside down by the smell of the tea. The video shows a slick operation, but it's not clear whether Alibaba hopes to expand its drone delivery after the trial is over, or what kind of safety considerations it has made for flying around urban areas. Should it plan to deliver more items by drone, it has hopefully cleared the flights with the relevant Chinese authorities, or it might end up with a frowny face of its own — BBC News reports that another drone delivery enterprise, set up by China's InCake bakery, was shut down by Shanghai authorities in 2013 for operating without a license.",0.6181260104236029,0.38187398957639707,0.8579992613402974,420,4.8547619047619044,241,5.8589211618257258,0,2,"Business, Tech"

The company's squat black coffee brewers have become fixtures in offices, hotels, and homes around the country, as have garbage cans heaped with the spent plastic pods they use. Purely on the strength of those machines — or more accurately, the relatively expensive pods they use — Keurig transformed its parent company, Green Mountain Coffee, from a small regional brewer to a major corporation doing over $4 billion in sales each year. Late last year, Keurig announced a new machine, the 2.0, calling it the ""future of brewing"" and touting its ability to make both small cups and large carafes. But another, less-publicized feature has been getting most of the attention: the brewer’s advanced scanning system that locks out any coffee pods not bearing a special mark. It’s essentially a digital rights management system, but for coffee, and it’s proving to be the brewer’s downfall. ""Talk about GREEDY corporate ridiculousness."" On an earnings call Wednesday the company announced that brewer sales fell 12 percent last quarter, the first full quarter for which the 2.0 was on sale. ""Quite simply our 2.0 launch got off to a slower start than we planned,"" said CEO Brian Kelley. He said the company had been too slow to get 2.0-compatible cups onto retail shelves and ""confusion among consumers as to whether the 2.0 would still brew all of their favorite brands."" Indeed, the 2.0’s Amazon reviews overflow with caffeine-deprived fury, the idiosyncratically capitalized wrath of people who bought 2.0 machines only to find that their old cups don’t work. ""Talk about GREEDY corporate ridiculousness,"" said one guy who tried to use his refillable pods. ""On principle alone, I hate that they are dictating which coffee I'm using in my machine,"" said another. ""It is a HUGE SHAME that the company decided to remove the ability to use your own coffee grounds in the home brew k-cup. ...They should have just said we made these changes so our products would sell more so we could make a bigger profit,"" reads a typical review. ""They took a potentially killer machine and added horrible DRM - a rights management system, in the greedy attempt to get all other coffee pod manufacturers to pay them so their pods work,"" reads another of the hundreds of one-star reviews. Many lamented the ability to give no stars. If you Google ""Keurig 2.0,"" the first thing that autocompletes is ""hack."" ""I hate that they are dictating which coffee I'm using in my machine."" The funniest thing about the backlash is that it was entirely predictable. Consumers hate DRM — in music, in movies, in anything — but applying it to coffee feels especially galling. It’s the most open caffeinated beverage there is; all you need is beans and hot water and, I guess, a vessel to brew it in. Locking it up in plastic cups was already a little silly, though something lots of people were happy to buy for the sake of convenience. Building a complicated infrared scanning system so that you can only use Keurig-approved cups was a step too far. At a Keurig 2.0 launch event last June, company representatives demonstrated the DRM system using old Keurig pods, without the scannable ink markers. If you tried to use one, the machine displayed a message saying ""oops"" and did nothing. It was designed to lock out cups made by third parties, but obviously it also locked out old Keurig ones, as the demonstration made clear. I asked whether that would be a problem, and no one seemed to think it would be. The old cups would be phased out, and retailers would carry only the new ones, Keurig said. That turned out to be wrong, possibly because so many Keurig users buy their cups in bulk, and probably because unlicensed pods were cheaper. Maybe the problems will subside somewhat now that retailers are stocking the new cups, but as Kelly acknowledged in the call, the initial angry response did a lot of damage. It’s the most open caffeinated beverage there is Keurig says the scanning system allows the machine to optimize brew temperature for different types of cups, and to tell the difference between carafe-size cups and regular ones. But at the event, a Keurig engineer said the technology is based on anti-counterfeiting technology used by the US Mint, which surely is not the simplest way of distinguishing between one pod and another. At a corporate level, Keurig’s attempt to make a DRM system for its coffee is understandable. The company’s business model depends on selling its brewers cheap and making money selling pods, a model reminiscent of printer manufacturers and their marked-up ink cartridges. It’s a tremendously lucrative business. Of Keurig’s $1.4 billion in sales last quarter, $1 billion came from selling cups. But in 2012, key patents on its cups expired, and competitors rushed in, selling compatible cups for cheaper and quickly eating into Keurig’s market share. You shouldn't have to hack your coffee Many of these companies have declared their intention to make 2.0-compatible cups. Others have sued. Yet another third-party cup manufacturer is giving away a free clip that it says tricks Keurig’s scanner. And YouTube is full of videos showing how to hack the system. Whether this stuff works is sort of beside the point. You shouldn’t have to hack your coffee, and that’s especially true for a company whose entire success is based on being super easy and convenient. Keurig’s latest earnings report proves that.

The bill received broad support in the House, with 338 votes for the bill and 88 against, but will now face a tougher road in the Senate. The Patriot Act's Section 215 expires June 1st The vote's timing was no coincidence: on June 1st, the NSA's authority to obtain phone metadata, granted by Section 215 of the Patriot Act, will expire. Rather than granting a full renewal of that authority, the Freedom Act keeps that metadata in the hands of telecoms, who can search for the information after receiving a court order that specifies information like a person or account. The bill also takes transparency measures, giving telecoms more options to publicly report on national security requests. The bill is meant to bridge the divide between Democrats hoping to fully end the NSA's power and Republicans hoping for a full renewal under the Patriot Act's Section 215. (President Barack Obama has also thrown his support behind the bill.) But the Freedom Act has still proven controversial: last year, a version of the bill was passed in the House, but eventually voted down in the Senate.  Civil rights groups like the Electronic Frontier Foundation have declined to support the new bill, arguing that it doesn't go far enough to stop NSA spying.

Martin voted against other Republican FCC commissioners to censure Comcast on the practice, although the order was eventually thrown out, setting the stage for this year's historic net neutrality fight. As chairman, Martin also supported ideas like the unbundling of cable TV packages, but could be more conservative at times, arguing against strong Title II regulation and generally making ""balancing deregulation and consumer protection"" a cornerstone of his policy.

The conditions apply to people who do ""substantial work"" for Facebook but are employed by another company, so long as that company is based in the US and has at least 25 employees working with Facebook. Presumably, if a company won't comply with these rules, Facebook won't work with them.  Microsoft, Google, and Apple have all started making similar changes  The changes are already in place for the ""largest support teams"" at Facebook's Menlo Park campus. ""We will be working to implement this program with a broader set of vendors within the year,"" Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook's chief operating officer, writes in a blog post. Though the new standards don't cover everyone who does work with Facebook — nor do they match the benefits one would receive while actually working for Facebook — they're still an important step toward dealing with income inequality issues in the US and Silicon Valley. That large teams right inside of Facebook's headquarters didn't previously have these benefits illustrates the problem acutely: contract workers may spend their days right alongside full-time employees while receiving vastly different pay and benefits. While Facebook doesn't say what support teams have received the benefits, it's likely that they may apply to security, maintenance, and food workers. The change isn't coming strictly from generosity — this is something contract workers have pushed for — but it's a cause starting to spread across Silicon Valley. Microsoft announced in March that it was mandating something similar: that contract workers get 15 days paid leave. Google and Apple have both started hiring security guards as full-time employees as well. Facebook, like Microsoft, says that part of the reason for doing this is that research has shown that ""adequate benefits"" lead to a ""happier and ultimately more productive workforce."" Sandberg also writes that it's an important change for women because they make up ""two-thirds of minimum wage workers nationally,"" making them ""particularly affected by wage adjustments."" The broader effect is that some of the biggest tech companies are now, essentially, advocating for better benefits for everyone.

The city was the site of a catastrophic Amtrak derailment, resulting in seven deaths and dozens of injuries, and first responders were scrambling to cut through the chaos. If you listened in to the open radio channels, you could hear it — EMS drivers looking for a hospital with room for patients, or dispatchers directing resources. Even finding the right staging area was a challenge at points, given the flood of different agencies rushing to help, and conducting everything over regular non-digital radio channels only made it more of a challenge. That's not to say the first responders were anything other than professional. Some chaos is inevitable, as responders rush in before the situation is fully understood. What's more remarkable is that despite the dawn of the internet age and the smartphone revolution, some of our most critical communication is still happening over primitive, walkie-talkie-style radio. The basic nature of the technology makes simple tasks like group formation and private messaging difficult, and imposes a constant stress over maintaining a clear channel. Aren’t there better tools for this job? Some jurisdictions already have them. First responders in California can access information through the Next-Generation Incident Command System (also known as NICS), an MIT project sponsored by the Department of Homeland Security. Developed over the last three years, NICS is meant to move all that communication to the web, plotting information on a constantly updating map of the area. The developers describe it as ""carefully designed for the responder under extreme stress,"" accessible through mobile browsers alongside desktops. It’s also built on open standards, allowing developers to build apps on top of it or allow third-party logins from services like Google. There are a lot of advantages to a system like NICS, starting with some of the basic questions responders faced on Tuesday night. If an ambulance driver is looking for the nearest hospital with room for new patients, a map will be more useful than a radio tool. But like any new product, adoption has been the biggest problem. NICS is available to anyone who wants it, and while it’s seen some adoption outside of California (particularly in pre-planned events like marathons), most departments have been slow to see the benefits. Even in California, the system is more of a supplement than a legitimate replacement for the standard radio system.  A test map from NICS. There’s also the issue of tracking victims in the wake of the disaster, which has also been tackled by digital systems. Wireless medical record systems have huge advantages over conventional paper methods in a crisis situation, and in 2009, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality made recommendations for a ""National Mass Patient and Evacuee Movement, Regulating, and Tracking System."" An ideal system would have the ability to locate and track patients, as well as regulate their flow during mass casualty events, the Agency said. RFID tags could be used to passively monitor location, providing continuous data without requiring patients to actively check in. The system could also include real-time resources availability data from hospitals, and send automatic notifications to first responders once it’s been decided where to send a given patient. Still, six years after the system was proposed, it’s still just a wish list, and there is no comprehensive federal system for patient tracking. So why haven’t more first responders adopted these systems? Bureaucratic inertia is certainly part of the answer, but there are also real practical concerns about how more complex systems will function in situations where the slightest technical failure can have life-or-death consequences. Thick smoke from a fire or explosion can interfere with signals In some cases, the problem is simply maintaining a signal. Thick smoke from a fire or explosion can interfere with signals coming from Bluetooth headsets and phones, which would cause real problems for any setup relying on a continuous connection. It’s a problem for voice radio signals too, but the nature of a responders’ channel makes it easy to drop off for a few minutes without disrupting the larger group. In other settings, the volume of traffic is a problem. Verizon, AT&T, Sprint, and T-Mobile networks were all overloaded in the aftermath of the Boston Marathon bombing in 2013, leaving many unable to contact loved ones. As a result, many are wary of moving responders to conventional data channels without more comprehensive connectivity solutions in place. Fortunately, first responders have call priority during emergencies, and could potentially get more spectrum help from the FCC if needed, but it still raises a world of problems that radio channels have already solved. Even more practically, conventional electronics don’t play well with a lot of first responder gear. Firefighters’ gloves make it hard to use tiny electronic devices with touchscreens, which is part of the reason why you’re more likely to see a rescue team with a gigantic radio unit in hand than the latest smartphone. There are solutions — different gloves, different devices — but they would have to be deployed at tremendous scale. There are about 1,140,000 firefighters,  239,000 EMTs, and 590,000 local police officers in the US, and they’re all trained on the proper use of radio channels. Training them on the latest tablet system is an immense task, particularly when we aren’t entirely sure what we want from the system itself. Seen in that light, the conventional radio channels look pretty good. It’s not the most powerful communication channel, but everyone responding knows how to use it, and there’s rarely any technical difficulty in signing on. As long as you can find the staging area, you can join the effort, with no passwords or downloads required, and that’s an important feature. First responders are working in situations of extreme urgency and chaos, and as a result, they end up using the most reliable and universal systems they can find. If that means forgoing the latest tech, it might be worth the tradeoff. T.C.

The words typically used to describe LA's HEALTH reflect this visceral quality; they are described as ""pulsating,"" ""pummel(ing),"" and ""pounding"" — actually, ""pound"" and ""pounding"" come up a lot. Seems kind of, hm, Freudian. Industrial music is often accidentally sexy anyway Sexuality, when it occurs in industrial lyrics, is typically played for shock value (Lords of Acid), comedy (Lords of Acid, again, but especially Voodoo-U; My Life With the Thrill Kill Kult's 13 Above the Night), the grotesque (KMFDM's ""Itchy Bitchy,"" Throbbing Gristle, ""Discipline,"" and — you'll never guess — Lords of Acid), and the melodramatic (Coil's ""Anal Staircase,"" Skinny Puppy's ""Love in Vein,"" KMFDM's ""Juke Joint Jezebel,"" Nine Inch Nails' ""Wish""). Industrial artists rarely deal well with lust, though there are notable exceptions (Nine Inch Nails' ""Physical"" and, of course, ""Closer""). The ""sexy"" lyrics in most industrial music are not especially observant or naturalistic. They are instead stylized performance art — at best, they are knowingly silly. At worst, they commit the undeniable sin of making sex boring. Industrial is often accidentally sexy anyway, though, because it's extremely reliant on beats. Disco drums (Ministry's ""Lava,"" Nitzer Ebb's ""Let Your Body Learn"") are part of that, of course. But the whirring machine noises are visceral — industrial music is meant to be felt, usually in a slow, grinding rhythm (a prime example: Skinny Puppy's ""Stairs and Flowers""). That's the point of the noise, after all — a visceral layer to the music, a bass line you can feel in your teeth. Which is precisely what makes HEALTH's DEATH MAGIC a remarkable album; they have matched the pounding rhythm to the lyrical content, without slipping into cliché. You get a hint of this right away, on ""STONEFIST"": ""We stay possessed by what we lost / And we both know love's not in our hearts.""  This is not wholly new territory for HEALTH. Both ""DIE SLOW"" — from their second album, GET COLOR — and ""USA BOYS"" — a single on their remix album, DISCO2 — are languidly sexy, thrumming, and atmospheric; their self-titled debut ended with the frankly sweet ""LOST TIME."" What's new, though, is that Jake Duzsik's ethereal, detached vocals are higher in the mix; it's possible to make out the lyrics. ""Follow your lust,"" Duzsik implores on ""FLESH WORLD."" The noise isn't just noise — it's carnal physicality It is, in some sense, possible to trace the contours of love by its absence; lovelessness is a central preoccupation of DEATH MAGIC (From ""LA LOOKS"": ""It's not love, but I still want you."" From ""DRUGS EXIST"": ""Try to love the ones who love us.""). There's a sort of abstract impressionist approach to love and lust in the lyrics and in Duzsik's remote vocals; any turmoil is expressed, instead, in Christopher Nolan-esque blatts, thumping low end, squalling guitars, and massive drum solos. The noise isn't just noise — it's carnal physicality, at an ideal tempo for grinding, with teeth-rattling intensity that's meant to be sensuously overwhelming. This isn't about love, sonically; it's about immense lust. Unlike in previous outings, HEALTH allows long stretches — even full songs, like ""LIFE"" — of assonance and even sweetness, extending the band's sonic and emotive range. Usually, you'd have to wait for the remix album to hear the melody buried under the din. But since HEALTH's first album, in 2007, pop has gotten noisier. Acts like FKA twigs, Disclosure, and even Britney Spears (the dubstep moments in ""Hold It Against Me"" and ""Freakshow"" come immediately to mind) introduced machinery and low-end wubbing to mainstream radio listeners' sonic palettes. Between the moves HEALTH has made toward pop, and the moves pop has made toward HEALTH, this album has the potential to introduce the band to a wide range of new listeners. At the very least, I expect many of DEATH MAGIC's songs will be in heavy rotation at alternative strip clubs.",0.8159913966881386,0.18400860331186142,0.13328369906104465,672,5.1443452380952381,435,6.0321839080459769,0,0,"Culture, Entertainment, Music, Music Review"

""The contracts had just gone out to my friends, and one of them sent me a screenshot of one of them,"" she told Vanity Fair. ""I read the term ‘zero percent compensation to rights holders.’ Sometimes I’ll wake up in the middle of the night and I’ll write a song and I can’t sleep until I finish it, and it was like that with the letter."" That letter, published on June 21st in the form of a Tumblr post, described Apple Music's initial artist terms as ""shocking"" and ""disappointing."" Apple originally planned to withhold royalties for any streams during the service's lengthy three-month free trial, trying to sell the idea that higher payments later on would compensate. But Swift and many other artists were unconvinced. ""Three months is a long time to go unpaid, and it is unfair to ask anyone to work for nothing,"" Swift wrote in June. The letter led to a stunning and almost instant reversal for Apple, with vice president Eddy Cue responding to Swift's frustrations later that day and pledging that Apple would in fact pay artists during the trial. ""I found it really ironic that the multi-billion-dollar company reacted to criticism with humility, and the start-up with no cash flow reacted to criticism like a corporate machine."" The quick response impressed Swift, who later gave Apple permission to stream her latest album, 1989. That deal is technically non-exclusive, but so far the hugely successful album hasn't appeared on rival services like Spotify, Google Music, or Tidal. ""Apple treated me like I was a voice of a creative community that they actually cared about,"" Swift said. ""And I found it really ironic that the multi-billion-dollar company reacted to criticism with humility, and the start-up with no cash flow reacted to criticism like a corporate machine."" That brutal quote suggests that Swift still isn't a fan of Spotify, though it's unclear how a company that loses more and more money with greater success was supposed to respond. If Spotify wants to rebuild any kind of relationship with Swift, the only option may be abandoning its free streaming tier altogether. In the aftermath of Swift's exodus from its service, Spotify has tried to emphasize the billions it has paid out to artists. Swift also told Vanity Fair that the letter was read — or heard — by one person before it went live: her mother. ""I read it to my mom,"" she said. ""She’s always going to be the one. I just said, ‘I’m really scared of this letter, but I had to write it.

Cheap Android tablets aren’t so great anymore. Three years ago, I remember rushing to Adorama here in New York City (along with several other Verge editors) to buy the first Nexus 7 when the store put it on sale early. That tablet, made by Asus, was pretty good. And then Asus came back the next year with an even better cheap Android tablet. The second Nexus 7 was $229 and, aside from an annoying16:10 aspect ratio, had few obvious faults. It was great. Fast forward to today, and we’re looking at Asus’ latest inexpensive tablet, the ZenPad S 8.0. But this is a much different tablet than the Nexus you may still have on your coffee table or tucked in a drawer somewhere. In some ways that’s good, but it’s mostly a regression. We’re somehow moving backwards. The Asus ZenPad S 8.0 tries to reproduce what was so appealing about the ZenFone 2. It’s impressive hardware being sold at a very low price ($199 or $299 depending on specs) with few gotchas to be found. But this is no Nexus, and left to its own devices, Asus is a company that struggles with software design. Whether the rest of what’s here can compensate for that will depend entirely on how you use a tablet. From a design perspective, the ZenPad 8 S earns big points — again, especially for the starting price. It's very thin and noticeably light at 0.66 pounds (Samsung’s 8.4-inch Tab S weighs 1.2 pounds). The back features a combination of etched aluminum and faux leather. That sounds more gaudy than it really is, and the materials make the ZenPad plenty comfortable to hold. This feels just as good as those old Nexus tablets, though the way everything’s laid out tells me Asus wants you to hold the device in landscape. But it’s 4:3, so the choice is all yours, and the bezels are easy enough to ignore when you’re staring at the display. That screen is a QXGA (2048 x 1536 pixel) IPS LCD. It's sharp, but also shares some unwanted traits with the ZenFone 2: it won't get terribly bright and the colors skew  on the cooler side. Neither of those things will ruin your Netflix or gaming experience. Most of the time you probably won’t notice, but the screen is clearly one area where Asus cut costs. Unfortunately, there are also some pretty bad software gimmicks that tie into the display. A thing that Asus calls ""Tru2Life+"" is easily the worst offender; Asus claims this video processing feature leads to smoother motion, but all it really does is bring the soap opera effect I hate seeing on TVs to tablets. It comes enabled by default, but thankfully you can turn it off with a quick trip to settings. Another improvement over the fabled Nexus 7 is sound. The ZenPad S 8.0 features dual front-facing speakers. They're not revelatory, but Netflix and YouTube videos sound a touch better than what you'd get from Amazon's Kindle Fire 8.9. Seriously, every tablet should have front-facing speakers by now. The tablet’s cameras (8-megapixel on back, 5-megapixel up front) are adequate only when your phone is far out of reach, though, which isn’t exactly a huge surprise. Depending on which model you get, the ZenPad includes 16GB, 32GB, or 64GB of built-in storage with support for microSD cards up to 128GB. For charging, Asus opted to go with USB Type-C, a choice that’s more hassle than convenience for the first smartphones that’ve made the same leap. But I’m more forgiving of tablets here; you don’t charge them nearly as often (and rarely away from home), and you’ll be all set when your next smartphone (or the one after it) inevitably uses the same port. Powering the ZenPad 8.0 S is a quad-core, 64-bit processor from Intel and, in our review unit, 4GB of RAM. (The less expensive, $199 ZenPad has a slower chip and 2GB of memory.) The tablet zips around and hops between apps with no noticeable stutters or lag. It’ll load games quickly, but I’ve seen some concerning issues during extended sessions. The ZenPad seems too cautious about overheating, and as a result it’ll sometimes hijack control of screen brightness to keep things in check. But it never really felt overly warm when these warnings popped up, so I’m hoping Asus will address this with a software update. The ZenPad doesn’t offer quick charge, nor can you top it off wirelessly. But its endurance matched the 8 hours that Asus is promising, and it’ll go way longer with intermittent or casual use. That’s how most people tend to use tablets, after all. But the company’s overall grade on software remains very mixed. Asus’ ZenUI bares little resemblance to stock Android, and it’s not for the better. There’s some good stuff; swipe up on the home screen and you get access to a ton of cool, nerdy customizations that let you choose new animations, icon packs, and fonts throughout the system. The software’s appearance is colorful and I wouldn’t label it offensive or unusable. It works, but it’s a far cry from Google’s vision for Material Design. And then there’s the bloat. The amount of unnecessary software that Asus crammed onto this thing is a truly shameful accomplishment. There’s a ""Mirror"" app that does nothing but open the tablet’s selfie camera, for instance. And even tools that are supposed to be helpful prove incredibly annoying and overbearing. It’s well established by now that Android runs just fine without memory management tools or anti-virus apps, and yet the ZenPad comes bundled with Clean Master and an obnoxious battery assistant that constantly wants you to know the game you’re playing is affecting battery life. (Obvious much?) The company even pesters you to review its keyboard in Google Play. Seriously? Most of this crud can be disabled or uninstalled entirely, and even if you leave the unwanted extras alone, the ZenPad still performs strongly. But this is where Android tablets really splinter with Google’s own products like the Nexus 9, which comes with apps that people actually enjoy using. You’ll never open half the stuff loaded on the ZenPad, and it’s an ugly situation I assume is mandated by Asus’ business partnerships. But let’s not let Google off too easy. Android tablets — regardless of cost — have progressed at a snail’s pace in recent years. Android Lollipop remains an underwhelming tablet OS now just as it did when the Nexus 9 shipped last year, and nothing new has been brought to the table. Google’s priorities are clearly smartphones and Chromebooks, and tablets (even the good ones) seem to be languishing by the wayside. Sure, the ZenPad will run Netflix, Hulu, HBO Go, and YouTube just fine. And Google Play Newsstand or Flipboard make for a decent way of scrolling through the day’s news. But so many other apps remain unchanged from what you’d get on a phone. When it comes to multitasking and productivity, companies like Samsung have had to devise their own solutions to stand out. As you might expect, Asus didn’t bother with any of that for a tablet that starts at $199. There’s little that’ll wow you here, but we’ll at least give Asus credit for meeting an impressive bar for performance and speed. The question is whether that’s good enough. For tech enthusiasts willing to tinker, it might be. Like the ZenFone 2, this new Asus ZenPad S 8 can be a decent-to-good purchase, but getting it there takes legitimate work that regular consumers probably wouldn’t bother with. They shouldn’t have to. Once you rid it of the bloatware and annoying notifications, the hardware you’re left with scores higher than most other devices at this price point. Install another launcher and it’ll even be pleasant to look at. But if you’re willing to spend even $100 to $200 more, you’re better off with something from Samsung or even Dell. And if media consumption is your main interest in owning a tablet, put your money toward Amazon’s Kindle Fire HDX line or an iPad instead. If Apple isn't your flavor and $300 is your absolute ceiling for spending, the ZenPad S 8 is likely the best you can do. But the tablet market is stalling hard for a reason, and if you’re looking for one compelling reason why you need this in your life, well, it probably doesn’t exist. And that's pretty disappointing, seeing as this is the very same company that made those great Nexus tablets.

But the company also gave us a glimpse of what else might have been. In the middle of a near-1,500-word blog post about the news sits an unassuming picture of Google employees who are weighing a number of different designs, all presumably riffs on the Google logo that didn't make the cut. There are some attempts at making the typeface all lowercase, one that looks very close to the design that Google just abandoned, and a few that are close to what we now know is the real thing. Perhaps the most radical is the one all the way to the far right — a more graphical spin on the logo where where ""Google"" is spelled out in solid circles and blocks. It would be silly to think that a lot of work didn't go into the new logo even though the brand new design has a ""simple"" aesthetic. Google is, after all, such a massive company that it recently authored a major reshuffling of its corporate structure.

But while its tiny inbox icon sits at the top of the app, Direct has often felt like an island within the larger Instagram app. You couldn’t share images from your feed using Direct, or respond to a photo with a photo, or start a conversation using text. But as of today, you can do all three, as part of a massive overhaul of Direct that makes Instagram feel like a full-featured messaging app for the first time. Share posts, locations, and profiles right from your newsfeed About 85 million people use Direct each month — less than one third of Instagram's 300 million-strong user base. That's likely a result of Direct's isolation from the rest of the app. It's clear people want to share images from the feed with their friends: the company says 40 percent of all comments on Instagram posts are ""@"" mentions. Today, that's the best way to direct a friend's attention to a post on Instagram. The Facebook-owned service hopes Direct will begin taking the place of those mentions starting today. ""We wanted to design Direct around conversations that are very visual and very rich. It was a natural extension, honestly, for our community,"" says Ann Baum, a software engineer who works on Direct. You can share more than photos in Direct now, too. Locations, hashtag pages, and profiles can all be sent as direct messages right from your Instagram feed. This makes Instagram more useful to groups — and you can add up to 15 people to a direct message. So if you see a picture of a particularly spectacular hike, by clicking the arrow button under the picture, you can share it with your local hiking group as a suggested activity. (Or just send it to your friend who thinks a 10-mile hike is a normal Sunday morning activity.)   Messages within a conversation are now threaded, to make for a more traditional messaging experience. You can reply to messages using text, emoji, or a new heart icon in the bottom right corner. You can also respond with an image of your own, either by sharing one from your feed, or through the new camera you'll find inside Direct, which lets you take a picture without having to leave the conversation. You can reply with text, emoji, or just a heart The team says Direct’s privacy model hasn’t changed.

In a report published this week, the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW) and Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) flagged 522 posts selling elephant ivory and other wildlife products, including tusks, jewelry, and furniture. The posts, identified across 28 US cities between March 16th and 20th of this year, encompassed 615 items with a combined list value of nearly $1.5 million. The elephant ivory trade remains a lucrative business for poachers, buoyed by high prices and strong demand. A 2014 report found that poachers killed nearly 100,000 African elephants in just three years, and experts say the trend has continued unabated, despite government pledges to crack down. The battle against poaching has largely focused on China, where ivory is seen as a status symbol for a rising middle class, but the groups behind this week's study say their findings point to a thriving market in the US, as well. ""We have an issue here in the US that needs to be dealt with."" ""I think it sends a very powerful message that we have an issue here in the US that needs to be dealt with,"" says John Calvelli, WCS executive vice president for public affairs and director of the 96 Elephants campaign. ""We should not be hypocritical and point the finger at others when we have issues here in the United States."" The US signed a global ban on ivory from Asian elephants in 1975, and from African elephants in 1990. Products that entered the country prior to these dates can be sold legally, but only 3 percent of the listings identified in this week's study included the necessary documentation. And although others claimed to include ""pre-ban"" or ""antique"" ivory, there is no way to determine their actual provenance. That doesn't necessarily imply that the other products included pre-ban ivory, and there's no data on how many were actually sold. But Calvelli says the prevalence of ivory products on the site underscores a need for stronger regulation. IFAW and WCS notified Craigslist of their findings prior to publishing the report Tuesday, and the site responded by adding explicit mention of elephant ivory to its list of prohibited items. The groups welcomed the move as an encouraging first step, but called upon the site to implement more aggressive measures, such as search filtering tools that would automatically flag any ivory items. (Craigslist did not respond to requests for comment from The Verge.) ""We’re not asking anybody to do things that are impossible."" Part of the problem, experts say, is that ivory products from poached elephants are often altered to look aged and antique, making them even more difficult to police on online marketplaces. Google, eBay, and Amazon came under criticism from conservationist groups in 2013 over ads for elephant ivory products, many of which were listed under code terms like ""white gold"" and ""unburnable bone."" ""Despite well-intentioned policies to ensure compliance with the law, e-commerce (particularly platforms that connect private sellers to consumers) can be hard to regulate,"" Rachel Kramer, a wildlife trafficking expert at the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), said in an email, adding that stronger mechanisms are needed to verify that purportedly ""antique"" items did not actually come from poached elephants. But there are models for Craigslist to follow, as this week's report notes. eBay introduced search filters after a 2008 IFAW report unearthed more than 4,000 listings for ivory products on the site, and Etsy has implemented a broad ban on illegal animal products. IFAW followed up with a 2014 investigation which showed that eBay's measures have been effective. ""The technology is there,"" Calvelli says.

The images — captured by the University of Oxford's Penguin Watch initiative — show the snow piling up before the penguins arrive, ready to breed. They quickly blanket the area with what looks like mud (here's a clue: it's not mud) and lo, the snow begins to melt. whatever's going on, the penguins aren't doing it on purpose Scientists studying the footage say it's possible that the darker color of the poo is helping to melt the snow by absorbing extra heat — a process known as the albedo effect. ""This is something we're testing at the moment,"" says Dr. Tom Hart, a penguinologist from the University of Oxford. ""The snow might also be melting because of mechanical erosion — because the penguins are walking around."" He stresses that whatever is melting the snow, the penguins certainly aren't aware that their poop might be doing it. They've got to poop somewhere after all.  Hart adds that this observation is more than just a curiosity — it could also help preserve endangered penguins. The birds in the footage are Gentoos, a species currently in competition with Adélie and Chinstrap penguins. But while the latter two species aren't doing so well, Gentoos are expanding their territory, despite being less tolerant of the Antarctic snow and ice. ""Gentoos have to wait for rock to be exposed before they can breed,"" says Hart. ""So if they're managing to gain additional ground by [melting the snow] early it might allow them to outcompete the Adélies and Chinstraps."" The footage was collected as part of Penguin Watch — a citizen science project run by the University of Oxford that invites the public to analyze imagery beamed from the Antarctic. Hart says there's simply too much footage for scientists to check themselves, but thanks to the public's help, he and his colleagues are discovering new details about penguins' lives in the Antarctic.

Most women only need to be screened for cervical cancer once every three years, according to a new set of practice guidelines that the American College of Physicians, a national organization of doctors, released today. Women under the age of 21 shouldn't undergo testing at all — regardless of their sexual health history — because many will receive abnormal test results without ever developing cervical cancer. While preventive screening seems like a positive thing, testing too often can lead to an increased incidence of false positive results — saying some women are sick when they aren't. Follow-up tests increase health care costs and can sometimes lead to pain. Right now, about 60 percent of women in the US say that they were  screened cervical cancer by the age of 21. Yearly testing ""does not lead to better care."" ""Screening more than once every three years does not lead to better care — it’s unnecessary care,"" says Tanveer Mir, physician and Chair-elect of the Board of Regents of the American College of Physicians. Despite similar guidelines issued by other agencies, doctors are still screening patients annually, she says — and that shouldn't be the case. ""Overall the focus of these guidelines is that physicians can practice good care by reducing over-treatment."" In most cases, cervical cancer is the long-term consequence of infection with a high-risk type of human papillomavirus (HPV) — a sexually transmitted infection. An estimated 13,000 women will be diagnosed with cervical cancer in the US this year, and 4,100 will die from the disease. But the overall incidence of the condition has decreased over the past few decades, largely because of increased screening. Screening is expensive, though — in 2010, the direct medical cost for screening and follow-ups was $6.6 billion. And, as researchers hone in on what factors increase a woman's cervical cancer risk, they've also come to realize that yearly screenings for women who don't have a history of cervical cancer or a weakened immune system doesn't make much sense — especially given the health risks associated with over-testing. Over-testing can lead to false positive results, and negative health consequences Testing can cause short-term anxiety, as well as  physical discomfort — which sometimes leads to bleeding, Mir says. False positives can lead to long periods of unnecessary surveillance, as well; women who receive an abnormal test result that  doesn't lead to treatment are watched carefully, regardless  of their age. More frequent testing — yearly testing — means treating or monitoring some young women whose cervical lesions would  have regressed on their own. ""And there are [negative health consequences] tied  to that, like pregnancy complications,"" such as increased risk for  pre-term birth, Mir says. That's why recommendations like the ACP's matter. They're designed to let physicians and their patients know that, in most cases, yearly testing for cervical cancer is overkill. ""I was thrilled to see that it reinforces the evidence base and consensus around US cervical cancer screening among women in the general population,"" says Jane Kim, a health policy professor at Harvard University who specializes in women's health. It ""really drives the message home to providers and patients that 'more' is not necessarily 'better.'"" ""I was thrilled."" The ACP's new guidelines are geared toward ""average-risk women,"" meaning women who have no prior history of precancerous lesions or cervical cancer. Average-risk women also include women who don’t have a weakened immune system — because of an HIV infection, for instance — as well as women who weren’t exposed to synthetic estrogen as fetuses, as practice that was popular between 1940 and 1971. Today's guidance is in agreement with previous guidelines issued in 2012 by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American Cancer Society and the US Preventative Services Task Force, among others. Women under 21 don't need to be screened at all, the guidance says. Past the age of 21, clinicians only need to screen average-risk women once every three years. And they should do so using the pap smear — a test that scrapes cells from the cervix. For women over 30, clinicians can safely lengthen the testing cycle to once every five years, using a combination of the pap smear and the HPV test. Average-risk women over the age of 65 can stop getting tested altogether if they have had three consecutive negative pap smear results or two consecutive negative HPV tests. Doctors haven't done a very good job of explaining to women that they  don't need get tested every year, the guidelines say. In fact, they haven't changed their behavior to respond to the  American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists' guidelines, released in 2012. Doctors often begin screening too early, and  perform screening too often, the ACP's report notes. ""As physicians, we need to do a better job trying to tell patients when screening should start,"" Mir says. ""The primary care physicians and gynecologists, all of us are in the same boat where we have to do a better job of educating our patients.""",0.4173080315022183,0.5826919684977817,0.8398405902675737,846,5.1713947990543732,421,6.2541567695961993,0,0,"Science, Report"

Bush administration on the CIA's torture program, according to a new report and emails released today. The report, written by a group of health workers and human rights activists, suggests the APA worked with top government officials to establish ethical guidelines that would allow the program to continue while shielding its architects from legal fallout. The group behind the report analyzed emails from a now dead behavioral science researcher working with the RAND Corporation and involved in national security organizations. According to the report, the emails show how the association collaborated ""with officials from the CIA, White House, and the Department of Defense to create an APA ethics policy on national security interrogations that comported with then­ classified legal guidance authorizing the CIA torture program."" Despite the close contact, according to the report, ""there is no evidence that any APA official expressed concern over mounting reports of psychologist involvement in detainee abuse during four years of direct email communications with senior members of the US intelligence community."" ""Your views were well represented by very carefully selected Task Force members."" In 2005, an APA committee called the Presidential Task Force on Psychological Ethics and National Security released guidelines concluding that psychologists could work with national security agencies as part of the torture program, although those guidelines were eventually retracted after criticism mounted. As evidence of how the administration was involved in the creation of those guidelines, the report cites one example of an email sent from the director of science policy at the APA to a CIA psychologist after the release of the guidelines: ""I thought you and many of those copied here would be interested to know that APA grabbed the bull by the horns and released this Task Force Report today. I also wanted to semi­-publicly acknowledge your personal contribution... in getting this effort off the ground over a year ago. Your views were well represented by very carefully selected Task Force members."" A report on the CIA's torture program — and psychologists' role in it — was released in December. Afterward, APA president Nadine Kaslow wrote to the Times that she and ""fellow members are outraged, saddened, and pained"" that two psychologists not with the APA had worked on the program.

Researchers have discovered a new process for producing ultra-thin transistors, according to a paper published today in Nature. The devices are made from an experimental material known as a transition metal dichalcogenide — also called a TMD. TMDs are exciting because they’re so thin, usually appearing as films of just a few atoms, with properties that make them useful for building solar cells, light detectors, or semi-conductors. It's an exciting prospect for physicists and manufacturers alike, but making the materials work consistently has proved extremely difficult. Today's result unearths the best process yet for manufacturing the materials, giving new hope that the material might someday give rise to atomically thin circuits and sensors. ""Our work pushes TMDs to the technologically relevant scale, showing the promise of making devices on that scale,"" said Saien Xie, one of the lead authors of the paper. ""In principle there is no barrier toward [commercial viability]."" ""Our work pushes TMDs to the technologically relevant scale."" If the finding does hold up, it could result in a real breakthrough for future generations of electronics. Modern chip manufacturers are already reaching the upper density limit for silicon chips, leading some to predict the end of Moore's Law. If electronics are going to keep getting smaller and faster, we'll need an ultra-thin material that can pack circuits even tighter without overheating or breaking down. It's hard to say whether TMD and graphene will fit the bill — they might still prove unwieldy, leaving chipmakers to make do with silicon — but for anyone dreaming of nanoscale electronics, today's result is an encouraging sign. TMDs are most often discussed alongside another cutting-edge ultra-thin material: graphene. Both materials can be produced in thicknesses of just a few atoms, which has led many researchers to call them ""two-dimensional materials."" Used in conjunction, they could eventually produce a new class of atom-thin electronics, either resulting in paper-thin devices — or allowing manufacturers to fit an unprecedented number of circuits into something the same size as a modern processor. A 99 percent success rate The Nature paper details a new way of producing TMD, more successful and stable than any previous method. The researchers turned to a proven industrial technique known as ""metal organic chemical vapor deposition (or MOCVD). The process starts with two commercially available precursor compounds — diethylsulfide and a metal hexacarbonyl compound — mixed on a silicon wafer and baked at 550 degrees Celsius for 26 hours in the presence of hydrogen gas. The result was an array of 200 ultra-thin transistors with good electron mobility and only a few defects. Just two of them failed to conduct, leaving researchers with a 99 percent success rate. It's the best production result TMDs have had so far, suggesting the material might one day be used to make ultra-thin electronics. Still, the next step is making sure it can be produced consistently. ""The report of new properties is important in order to understand the material, but there is a lack of systematic research on synthesis methods,"" said Humberto Gutierrez, a physicist at the University of Louisville who also works on ultra-thin materials and was not involved in the paper. ""Many of the [previously] reported conditions using chemical vapor deposition cannot be reproduced from one laboratory to another, and the large area films have very low crystal quality."" Hammering out those inconsistencies is crucial if researchers are going to build workable devices out of the new materials. The researchers will also need to be able to produce the TMDs at a lower temperature if they’re going to be used in conventional electronics, as many auxiliary materials will combust at 550 Celsius. Still, the biggest concern now is simply expanding on the current results. If researchers can produce the ultra-thin transistors consistently, there will be lots of opportunities to refine the process in the future.",0.5154588664250684,0.48454113357493156,0.17900655585994205,665,5.3428571428571425,366,6.527322404371585,0,0,"Science, Tech, Report"

The news was announced today by a scientific panel convened by global health authorities, reports The New York Times. The Americas is the first World Health Organization region to eliminate the disease. 120,000 children born with birth defects associated with rubella every year Sometimes referred to as the German measles, rubella is a contagious viral infection that is best known for causing a red rash and a fever. Its effects can be far more destructive, however.  In 1964 and 1965, an epidemic in the US resulted in 12.5 million cases of rubella. During that time, approximately 20,000 fetuses were born with rubella-associated defects. Another 11,000 fetuses were miscarried or aborted. Thankfully, a lot has changed since then; the last known case of rubella in the Americas was confirmed in 2009, in Argentina. Diseases have been eliminated from the Americas before. In 1971, an announcement was made that smallpox had been eliminated. A little over 20 years later, polio followed suit. Today, smallpox has been eliminated from every region of the Earth. Polio, however, has resurfaced a number of times — notably in Pakistan. Despite today's milestone, about 120,000 children around the world are born with birth defects associated with rubella every year. There is no cure for rubella, but it can be prevented thanks to a vaccine, called MMR, which also protects against the measles and the mumps. ""Although it has taken some 15 years, the fight against rubella has paid off,"" Carissa Etienne, director of the Pan American Health Organization, told The New York Times. ""Now, with rubella under our belt, we need to roll up our sleeves and finish the job of eliminating measles, as well."" Measles cases have been making a comeback in the US recently, largely because of people who refuse to vaccinate their children.

They've been trying to figure out which it is for months, and now newly released test results are ruling out the prevailing hypothesis for why what they're looking at is an error, according to NASASpaceflight. In a thorough breakdown of the new engine, called an EM Drive, NASASpaceflight calls these recent tests a major breakthrough in NASA's research.  The drive still worked in a vacuum The new tests were conducted in a vacuum, unlike all prior tests, and the EM Drive was still found to work. In particular, this allows NASA to rule out the possibility that the drive's thrust is being created by heat transfer outside of the drive, rather than inside of it. The theory is that this drive can create force by bouncing electromagnetic waves around inside of a chamber, with some of their energy being transferred to a reflector to generate thrust. On the surface, this sounds a lot like something that violates the conservation of momentum, though the originator of the idea believes that this isn't actually the case. There's obviously still quite a bit of work to be done here. NASASpaceflight says that the focus should remain on how this thrust is coming about — meaning it's still a matter of verifying that a working EM Drive is possible. NASA, through its Eagleworks lab, reportedly intends to do further tests on EM Drives in a vacuum after seeing these latest results. Should the drive pan out one day, the belief is that it would dramatically reduce the weight of what NASA has to launch into space, NASASpaceflight reports.

Vaculik spoke about how he dreamed of a flying car for the first time 25 years ago, looking for a way to escape an oppressive political regime in Czechoslovakia. ""We need another revolution, we need a revolution in personal transportation."" If that metaphor isn't enough for you, Vaculik moved on to identify three new ""prisons"" afflicting modern commuters just like (apparently) a communist regime: the traffic prison, the airport prison, and the prison of bad infrastructure. Vaculik also thinks that self-driving cars are only a ""partial"" solution. The real solution, he says, are flying cars. All three are serious problems for car-based transit, yes, but I'm dubious that flying cars are the best solution (or even a good solution) for any or all of them. Vaculik says he's very serious about the possibilities, though, laying out a history of the engineering behind flying cars. AeroMobile started prototyping by hanging models on the front of cars and driving around, because the company didn't have access to wind tunnels. Vaculik showed a prototype from a couple of years ago, and then version 3.0 of the car, shown in October 2014.  The new model is apparently robust enough to be able to take off and land from grass strips, not just airport runways. So Vaculik imagines large grass strips next to freeways and gas stations, which would increase the number of places you could take the car. That's all well and good, but AeroMobile would actually need to convince municipalities to build such things — not to mention ensure it doesn't run afoul of regulations. Responding to a question about that last issue, Vaculik said his car will fit into pre-existing categories for both planes and cars. So you'd need to be a certified pilot to operate the vehicle. The first commercial product will be a two seater and include a parachute — AeroMobil is targeting 2017 for launch. It's not clear whether AeroMobil will be able to actually achieve that goal, but it does seem like the first prototype is working. Speaking after the event, Vaculik said the biggest work that needs to be done revolves around adding all the basic safety component necessary in a car and an airplane. He also noted that the company is still experimenting with different engines and will be conducting crash testing soon. Of course, that target market of ""wealthy supercar buyers"" is a clear sign that concerns about the price of flying cars aren't going away. Asked about whether this would become nothing more than a ""hobby for the rich,"" Vaculik expressed hope that the cost of technology always drops — but he also declined to name a specific price beyond that it would be over a ""couple of hundred thousand"" Euro. After that model, AeroMobile wants to release a four-seater flying car designed to be fully autonomous. If a the pie-in-the-sky dream of the flying car wasn't enough, now you can hope for a self-driving/self-flying car. Because it's SXSW, Vaculik said he was looking forward to ""Flying Uber or flying Lyft."" And because it's SXSW, it was fitting that we heard that Dean Kamen, the creator of the Segway scooter, is joining the board of advisors for AeroMobil.",0.4249736811001862,0.5750263188998138,0.8521087136915378,582,4.9037800687285227,321,6.009345794392523,0,0,"Transportation, SXSW 2015"

It's the fifth race of the series' inaugural season, and if you haven't heard of it yet, you're probably not alone. Formula E is a lot like Formula One — they're both run by the same governing body, the Federation Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) — but there are some key differences. The biggest is that the cars are completely battery powered; there are no combustion engines here in Miami except for the ones driven by the fans. The cars emit a high-pitched whir instead of the roar typically heard in auto racing. There are also no pit stops during the race. Instead of running out of gas, the Formula E cars will run out of battery about halfway through the 39-lap event. Before that happens the drivers must make it to the pit area where, instead of swapping batteries, they will hop into an entirely different car. There are 10 teams competing this weekend, each made up of two drivers. That means each team is here with four cars each, which has made for a busy day in the garage area while the cars are being assembled (they were shipped here in pieces in giant DHL packages) and preparations are made for tomorrow's action. The drivers come from all disciplines, but many have backgrounds in the major racing series like Formula One, NASCAR, IndyCar, and WRC.  Driver Karun Chandhok runs through car-swapping drills with his team on Friday afternoon. The first four races took place in Beijing, Punta del Este, Uruguay, and Buenos Aires. Some of those races, like the Beijing debut, saw strange start times here in the United States. Fox Sports 1 handles the US broadcasts and has experimented with tape-delayed broadcasts, but those had to compete with tail end of the football season. Tomorrow's race in Miami and next month's in Long Beach will be the best shot for Americans to familiarize themselves with series without ruining their circadian rhythms. The same unfamiliarity seems to apply to the residents of Miami, despite the numerous billboards and radio ads in English and Spanish. Many locals are accidentally stumbling onto the track as they go through their normal Friday routines. Cyclists are whirring down the streets where the race will take place, and pets are being walked across the finish line to the park adjacent to the American Airlines Arena. This is because the track, the fan experience center, and just about everything else is still under construction. There's much work to be done before the real show kicks off early tomorrow morning.  A family skateboards on a street that the Formula E cars will speed down tomorrow. Formula E's events are, by design, one-day affairs for both drivers and fans. Instead of the long weekends that NASCAR and IndyCar races demand of race teams and fans, all of the Formula E races (and the preceding practices and qualifying sessions) take place on one day. That makes it challenging for the teams, but the series directors see it as a way to make the experience easy for the fans. If Formula E is ever going to find a foothold in the racing world, it needs to think this way. Whatever the FIA is doing with Formula E, it's worked so far. A different driver has won each of the first four races, all of which have been packed with drama. The mix of heavy, difficult-to-manage cars and tight street courses has produced some heart-pounding, if at times messy, racing action. Nothing less should be expected from tomorrow's race.

The cars are sold and managed out of a local Chicago dealership, Green Wheels USA, and is part of existing Uber efforts to hook its drivers up with cars that they can buy, rent, or lease. According to Reuters, an Uber spokesperson says the program could expand to other cities in the future.

Speaking at Audi's annual press conference in Germany yesterday, engineering chief Ulrich Hackenberg said the company plans on bringing a battery-powered ""sports activity vehicle"" in early 2018. That car, which Hackenberg described as ""very attractive,"" would also have a range upwards of 500 kilometers (or about 310 miles), he added. Here's what was quickly flashed behind Hackenberg as Audi's current concept for the vehicle:   The vehicle will compete squarely with Tesla's upcoming Model X, which is expected by the end of this year (after several delays). Its expected 200 to 225 mile range would be well below Audi's, though it could be on the market a two whole years before the German automaker gets its first car in the hands of customers.

The bill has already passed the state's General Assembly, so Christie now has 45 days to sign or veto. Christie tried to shift the blame for the ban on the state's legislature. ""I'm not pushing Tesla out; the state Legislature did,"" Christie said at a town hall meeting last year. ""What they were asking for was an exception from the law. I'm not the king.""

And Michigan, once home to 29 percent of all the nation's auto jobs, banned Tesla from direct sales last October. The bill in New Jersey to allow Tesla's direct sales does come with some limits. Tesla can only open a total of four of its own dealerships and has to operate at least one service center. (Tesla already had two dealerships before last year's ban, but hasn't been able to offer test drives or discuss sales since it was enacted.) Should Christie approve it, the bill would go into effect immediately. If he decides to veto, Tesla will still be locked out of the state.

""Range anxiety"" is the notion that you're always worried you won't find a charger for your electric car before the juice runs out. It's a more serious problem for the many EVs on the road with sub-100-mile ranges like the Nissan Leaf, VW e-Golf, and Ford Focus Electric, but even the Model S — which has a range of 200 miles or more, depending on configuration — gets roped into the conversation. Perhaps it's because if you do run out of power, you can't just walk a few blocks to the nearest gas station, fill up a canister, and bring it back to your car; perhaps it's that even the fastest Supercharger isn't as fast as topping off a tank. Regardless, ""range anxiety"" is the boogeyman used more than any other to throw a wet blanket on the EV industry. It's a major reason General Motors has plowed billions into the ""extended-range electric"" Voltec platform, which combines an electric drivetrain with gas for backup.  Tesla press conf at 9am on Thurs. About to end range anxiety ... via OTA software update. Affects entire Model S fleet.  ""Ending"" range anxiety, as Musk teases, isn't a simple matter. It's not a question of simply squeezing a few more miles of range out of the Model S's batteries with more efficient motor control, as could be delivered by a firmware update. A Model S could get 350 or 400 miles between charges, but you'd still run into the same issues that you do at 250: when you're getting low, what do you do if you're not close enough to a charger? What if you can't charge quickly enough? That's why I don't believe that the firmware update will just extend range. Perhaps it will do that — it certainly wouldn't be unprecedented for improved range to come from software alone — but there will probably be other components to it as well. A simple concept would be a driver-selectable reserve. If Tesla was able to squeeze, say, another 15 miles out of the battery with improved efficiency in firmware, but it socked those miles away in a reserve rather than simply adding them to the car's indicated range, that could give drivers some peace of mind. That way, if the car's about to turn itself off and you still can't get to a charger — or at least a safe place — you press a button on the car's control panel to unlock the emergency supply of extra power. This is probably more than just a range increase But that's not very smart, and I suspect Musk wants something that's bulletproof here — something the driver doesn't really have to think about. What if the car continually calculated your available range versus distance to home or a Supercharger, and warned you when you were in danger of straying too far? The car's navigation system can already take Superchargers into account when planning routes, but a constant red-yellow-green indicator in the instrument cluster could make a big difference. Being told that you need to start looking for a charger with 100 miles left is a lot less stressful than seeing the same message with 5 or 10 miles left. The Supercharger network is only so large, though. It's also possible that Tesla has found a way to charge a bit faster from Level 2 charging stations, which have grown ubiquitous in even small- to medium-sized towns — the problem is that they can take many hours to top off the battery. I wouldn't expect miracles here, but then again, it's Elon Musk. Who knows? Clearly, a range bump is the easiest and most obvious thing to offer as a firmware update. But you probably don't hold a press conference to announce something like that — I suspect this is bigger. We'll know more on Thursday.

Even for a product known for its long learning curve, Twitter’s old profile pages could be vexing. The text of your biography smushed on top of your header photo, making both hard to look at. Background images tiled awkwardly. And when you looked at a profile, says Sachin Agarwal, a product manager at Twitter, ""it was impossible to quickly figure out — who is this person?"" Dave Bellona, a designer at Twitter, puts it another way. ""It was hard to make the old profile look good."" Bellona, who joined Twitter a year and a half ago, led the effort to find a better design. Rolling out now across the web, the new profile comes at a time when Twitter is seeing fewer new profiles created than it would like. The company reported 255 million active users last week, well short of the 400 million that Twitter reportedly hoped to have by the end of 2013. Embedded in the new look are changes that make the profiles prettier and more of a destination in their own right than they were before. But the redesign raises the same question that seemingly every change to Twitter’s product does these days. Can Twitter tweak its way back to hyper-growth? Can Twitter tweak its way back to hyper-growth? Interviews and design mock-ups shared with The Verge show a company that tried a series of bolder approaches before settling on one that should be more familiar to users of other social networks. They also show how seriously Twitter is taking the challenge of making the service more inviting to newcomers — even at the risk of alienating early adopters. The redesign began with the insight that for many people, the profile page has become more than a gateway to Twitter’s service. As Twitter grew in stature and importance, the profile went from being a simple repository of tweets to a showcase for the online identity you present to the world. The profiles are indexed by Google, and over time have come to rank highly in search results. ""We really see the Twitter profile as your public identity online,"" says Agarwal, who joined Twitter in 2012 after the company acquired Posterous, the blog platform he co-founded. ""It brings together all the content you’re producing on all these services, all just coming in live. We want the profile and the @ handle to be things you put on your business card."" To be business-card worthy, Twitter needed to help its users present themselves with more style. The old profile had the pancake stack of bio and header image sitting on top of a hard-to-scan stream of tweets and replies. It included every reply a user ever sent, making the stream look like a litany of one-sided conversations. Something had to change. For a new design principle, Bellona turned to print media. ""Could this be more like a magazine cover,"" he wondered, ""where we’ve surfaced the best of the best?"" What followed were months of iteration and user tests. The designs organized tweets in two basic ways: into tiled cards, as you might find on Pinterest, and into a feed, which would be more familiar to Twitter users. This summer, Twitter tested one card-based design that made certain cards bigger based on the relative level of interaction the tweets were receiving.  Bellona’s interest in ""the best of the best"" also led the company to experiment with a profile that organized tweets by popularity instead of chronology — a sharp break with the service’s traditional presentation that was ultimately axed. ""We’re a time-based feed service,"" Bellona says. ""This doesn’t feel right."" The company’s attention turned to designs that incorporated a more traditional, feed-like layout. But the company’s interest in highlighting a person’s best work persisted. Another design selected the three most popular tweets for a given user and placed them at the top of the profile.  But that design presented problems of its own. Many popular tweets are inexplicable once you remove them from the day they were posted. Putting months-old tweets on top of a person’s feed risked making the profile feel dated and inaccessible. Ultimately, Twitter settled on the profile design now rolling out across the web. It strips out replies by default, so that you no longer feel like you’re missing out on half the conversation when you browse someone’s posts. It highlights a person’s most popular tweets by making them larger in the feed, based on their relative level of engagement. And if there’s something that the user wants to highlight regardless of its popularity, there’s now an option to pin a favorite tweet to the top of the profile. A broader effort to become more visually appealing The profiles also update automatically every time a new tweet is posted, so if someone were live-tweeting an event that interested you, you could just keep their profile open and watch their posts in real time. It’s all part of a broader effort across the company’s products to make them more visually appealing. Photos are now larger, and videos from the company’s Vine app play automatically when you scroll. ""Right off the bat, we knew we had to make the media experience just phenomenal,"" Agarwal says. ""And so there’s a lot more of a focus on that in the new design."" The design is also friendlier to new users in subtle ways. Previously, someone who created a new account would see a profile full of zeros — no followers, no tweets, no favorites. One of Bellona’s mantras for the new profile was ""no eggs"" — and as a result, you’ll never see a giant zero on your profile. Tweets, followers, and favorites won’t appear there until you have some to show. ""It should just grow with you as you start to experiment,"" Bellona says. The new profiles go hand in hand with other efforts Twitter is making to court new users, including one that pre-populates a first tweet for them to take more guesswork out of the process. ""Oh, it looks similar to Facebook"" As with most major redesigns, Twitter’s new profiles have drawn a mixed reception. One of the most common criticisms is that the company is simply aping Facebook — but Bellona says they never set out to mimic anyone. In a roundabout way, he suggests that social-network profiles are bound to share some features in common. ""When you’re designing a car, you put the steering wheel on the left-hand side of the car,"" he says. ""It’s that type of thing. We’re designing a page that has to handle lots of different types of content, handle different types of languages, different types of use cases on different screen sizes. Then we got to it and it was like one of these things like — Oh, this feels really good. Oh, it looks similar to Facebook. That was the thing. Well yeah, I’m not going to put a doorknob in the middle of the door. I’m going to put it on the left-hand side of the door."" The best indication of the profiles’ success will be whether the company’s slowing growth rate rebounds three months from now, when Twitter next reports its quarterly earnings. The company has improved on previous designs in meaningful ways, making good on the promise of a profile that can serve as a powerful public identity online. The question now is how much that matters.",0.6411514683286853,0.3588485316713147,0.5123341201818793,1244,4.821543408360129,574,6.1027874564459932,0,0,"Design, Tech, Web, Report"

""I wondered if HTC's gorgeous, metallic One would inspire or challenge Samsung to leave behind its cheap, plasticky ways and build a smartphone as beautiful as it is feature-rich,"" he said. ""The Galaxy S5 is not that phone."" Will Lee take Samsung's design in a new direction? The 42-year-old Lee Min-hyuk, who designed cars for Samsung's ill-fated Renault partnership in the 1990s, is known for his involvement with the Galaxy series, which was part of a massive patent war with Apple. ""I've made thousands of sketches and hundreds of prototype products (for the Galaxy). Does that mean I was putting on a mock show for so long, pretending to be designing?"" Lee said in response to copycat accusations. The basic design of Samsung's Galaxy smartphones and tablets have stagnated since the 2012 release of the Galaxy S3. Given Lee's involvement with the product line, it's uncertain if his leadership will precipitate any massive changes. However, we'll see in the coming months if Lee can take Samsung's mobile design in a new direction.",0.5788455171932143,0.4211544828067857,0.7833454426563531,248,5.133064516129032,169,5.8224852071005921,0,0,"Design, Tech"

I'm in the middle of a residential street just outside of Amsterdam, yet the nostalgic whiff of high-school woodshop is unmistakable. I'm looking for the factory that makes Miniot's expertly crafted wooden iPhone and iPad cases — but there isn't one. Instead, at my destination stands a large but otherwise unremarkable family home, indistinguishable from its neighbors. No signs, just the sweet earthy scent of freshly cut lumber.  I ring the bell. Woof. A dog?  Yes, a dog. And children and cookies, too. Miniot is a family business very unlike the Samsung chaebols and Apple corporations that dominate the technology news cycle. I'm standing at the home of Peter Kolkman and Greet van den Berg, owners of Miniot and papa and mama to Piet, Jet, and Berend. It's also the location where the company designs, cuts, and assembles the tens of thousands of products it ships to more than 70 countries. Here, family and profession blur into a uniquely modern balance of work and play.  Kolkman’s first to the door with his great shock of salted gray hair, which hints at both technical genius and artistry — Einstein and Robert Pollard poured liberally into a blue-flannel shirt. His hand, abraded into a coarse melange of callused digits, reaches out to welcome me. I push my lavender-scented palm into his and step through the door, emasculated. ""Coffee?"" asks Van den Berg while the dog — Sean Connery — enthusiastically explores my crotch, then my ass, and then back to my crotch with his promiscuous snout. ""Sure, black,"" I say as she smacks the dog and turns away in a well-rehearsed pirouette, flashing copper tresses forged into a loose pile at the base of her neck. The morning sun splinters through a transept of stained glass and strikes what looks like a car bumper in the other room. If this is Peter’s church that I'm standing inside, a place where man prostrates himself before the totems of design, craftsmanship, and family; then Greet, I will learn, is the rock upon which it is built. Peter Kolkman Miniot as a company is a direct expression of Kolkman's relentless need for creative expression. ""I had a graphic design studio where I worked for customers,"" he reminisces. ""But I wanted to make things of my own so I purchased a 3D milling machine and learned to master it in my free time."" That was in 2007. ""In the process, I thought it would be nice to make a wooden case milled out of one piece of wood for the iPod. I checked the internet and nobody else was making one. So I made prototypes and I went into the woodworking industry to see if it could be produced. It couldn't, nobody could make it. So we decided to do it ourselves."" Seven years later and that single machine has spawned a dozen more, many designed by Kolkman himself. It’s now so busy that the business has taken over the house, forcing Van den Berg, Kolkman, and the kids to take up residence in a smaller building attached at the back — a home Van den Berg and Kolkman largely designed, built, and furnished themselves. ""We choose to do it this way and not from some industrial building because it integrates work and life,"" says Kolkman. ""Like design and manufacturing is the same process, I think work and life are also the same process. I have one life and there I make my things. And my kids are around and a part of it all."" Miniot’s not exactly big, not compared to the company in Cupertino whose products it accessorizes. It currently employs just five or six people, depending upon demand, a number Kolkman and Van den Berg have arrived upon by choice as it gives them the ideal ratio of industry responsiveness to product control. ""It’s also a good balance of size and fun,"" says Kolkman, a dynamic that's clear as both kinfolk and employees sit down at the oversized family table for a traditional lunch of hearty breads and smoked fish. ""There are a lot of plastic and rubber cases that are mass produced,"" says Kolkman, ""but it's nice to have a craftsmanship approach."" All Miniot products are made of the wood culled from FSC-certified forests: padouk, wenge, oak, walnut, maple, mahogany, and cherry are currently on the menu. ""I work with wood because it's warm. It gives a glass and metal device a completely other feel and look. And when it's a year old and full of scratches it's even nicer."" But wood's a challenging material to manipulate within the extreme tolerances of Kolkman’s designs. ""I'm not a furniture maker,"" says Kolkman, ""I'm a designer and use solutions that are not normal to the woodworking industry."" That means laser-equipped CNC machines driven by the CAD drawings plucked from the man’s imagination. The resulting precision allows magnets to be hidden so deftly inside the impossibly thin recesses of its cases that you'll swear they've somehow magnetized the wood. And one look at the milled volume buttons on a Miniot case is proof of the company's fastidiousness. Mouseover/touch video to play 1. Peter’s designs start on a computer where they're converted into instructions that drive a handful of CNC milling machines of varying dexterity. Many of the machines have been tweaked to match Miniot’s specialized manufacturing needs. 2. Each part is inspected for quality and beauty. Henk then sands, cleans, and applies a finish appropriate to each wood's surface. The drying racks and chambers are designed by Peter, like many of the tools used at Miniot. 3. The pneumatic assembly station for Miniot's iPad cases is, itself, a thing of beauty and skilled engineering. Greet releases and adds suction to assemble the roll-top iPad covers while Judith glues iPhone cases and tucks away the magnets. 4. Computer-controlled lasers etch the miniot logo onto finished iPad cases. Lasers also cut the paper stock that Sterre and Marian use to ship the final products to customers. Each case receives a final cleaning before the box is sealed. While Miniot’s designs are very much Kolkman’s, he’s adamant that it’s not a one-man show. ""I can't do this without Greet,"" he says, ""Not just for the support but also for the challenge. I have to convince her that my design is good enough."" Van den Berg is also a designer, just not a designer of Miniot cases. ""I have to be really convincing to have it passed."" And while Kolkman’s busy tightening radiuses and hunting down excess microns to shave, Van den Berg can be found shopping for lunch and tutoring the kids while simultaneously managing Miniot’s customer service and fulfillment needs. Miniot’s cases and covers can cost upwards of $200 and take weeks to produce, not hours, because Kolkman and Van den Berg refuse to outsource production. ""We make a relatively small series and use the most beautiful wood we can find,"" says Kolkman, ""and when I can do it all myself I have much more control over the quality."" The work pace is relaxed, yet purposeful — each person going about his or her business as Van den Berg whistles or sings old Beatles songs beneath her breath. Greet van den Berg Naturally, stores are flooded with cheap Miniot rip-offs but most don't bother with any buttons at all, opting for simple cut-outs instead. ""The copycats are annoying,"" says Kolkman, but they’ve had little impact on day-to-day business — Miniot already sells everything it can produce. Kolkman’s mostly irritated by their laziness. ""The product should feel like a wooden iPhone, not an iPhone with a wooden thing around it."" Regardless, he just keeps on inventing. ""I do my own thing and think of my own solutions because that's much more fun."" Still, even at the prices that Miniot demands, the company hasn’t made Van den Berg and Kolkman wealthy, at least not in that absurdly modern Kimye sense of the word. ""We are doing this for seven years and I discovered that this isn't a way to get rich,"" laughs Kolkman, bringing a rush of bemused joy to his face. ""But it's a way to have a very rewarding life making beautiful products that are appreciated by a large audience across the world. And living from your own ideas is a very fulfilling thing to do."" ""It's true, we don't go on holidays,"" adds Van den Berg, ""And it's true that we, especially Peter, don't have a very social life. We're always working, but we don't call it 'working.’ The work we do is what we are and we do what we feel like. We're very lucky. We're able to think of something, make it, and then have a living from it. That's very special. How many people can say that?"" Very few, is the answer. Kolkman, especially, is that rare renaissance craftsman whose very existence is wildly incongruous with this epoch of hyper-specialization and plastic overconsumption. As I prepare to leave, I ask Kolkman about the car bumper propped conspicuously in the corner of the workshop. ""Oh that,"" he smiles. ""That’s the bumper off my 1961 Jaguar Mk2,"" Kolkman’s bordeaux red daily-driver that he’s now restoring. ""When I’m done, my dream is to make the Mark 2 electric."" I have no doubt that he will.

But there are many other ways of looking at our planet. For example, what would the map of the world look like if each country only controlled all the land closer to its capital city than any other country's capital? Some might argue that it'd produce ""mathematically perfect"" borders. Data visualization freelancer Jason Davies has had fun exploring these ideas using mathematics. With algorithms and the right datasets, he splits the planet into regions that contain only the land nearest a certain point — say, a capital city. Maps made with this technique are called Voronoi diagrams, and he's made maps of the world and the US that use the technique. The results are fascinating — and beautiful. The discrepancy between what land a country mathematically ""should"" own and the borders we know today is a result of everything from war and politics to geography and biology. Davies' latest map leaves capitals behind. He's now divided the world into roughly 3,000 regions for all the medium and large airports in the world. Naturally, the wealthiest regions with high population densities have the greatest number of airports, but the Voronoi diagram shows just how much of the planet is sparsely served by air travel. If we have flyover states in the US, then there are clearly massive swaths of flyover land in the rest of the world. The most remote airport in the world, you ask?

The library program is supposed to make sailors feel more at home when they’re abroad. But the limited selection — a small subset of the Navy’s 108,000 digital library titles — reflects the military’s culture of imposed discipline. iPads, Kindles, and Nooks would also allow sailors to download whatever titles they want (although finding an internet signal would still be a challenge). The NeRD lets the Navy control their reading habits just as it does with their diet and sleep schedule. In other words, entertainment in the military is not unlike it is in prison: there are many restrictions on the few options available to break up the monotony of the daily routine.

The new BeoVision Avant is an unsurprisingly minimal take on a modern television, and features a few unique tricks to set it apart from the mass market TVs lined up at Best Buy. The BeoVision Avant's 55-inch LED panel is made by Samsung and offers bright colors and wide viewing angles. It's framed by a barely-there bezel and is accompanied by a built-in 3-channel audio system with eight speakers and eight separate amplifiers. The Avant has a built-in light sensor that constantly monitors the lighting conditions in the room and adjusts the set automatically for the best presentation without any input from the viewer.   Motorized movement makes the Avant unique The Avant is an attractive television in its own right, but what really makes it unique are the various motorized stands that Bang & Olufsen is offering with it. The stands, which include a wall-mount option, a floor model, and a stand designed to sit on an entertainment center, move the TV around into a variety of positions depending on what you're watching and where you are. The free-standing floor model features a round base that orbits the TV into position, hiding it away when not in use and bringing it forward for viewing. It mimics the way a theater begins a movie: turn the TV on and the black screen parts down the middle and the base rotates to bring the display into view. The Avant can be programmed with nine different positions that a user can bring up on demand through its remote. The Avant's remote has been shown special attention, too. The single piece, unibody aluminum design looks good while offering comfortable ergonomics and a minimal interface. The BeoRemote One, as it's been dubbed by the company, is designed to replace all of the TV, set top box, Blu-ray player, and Apple TV remotes in your living room, making it the only one you need to have around when it's time for entertainment.  Bang & Olufsen's products never come cheap, and the BeoVision Avant is no exception. Priced at $7995 and available this month, it's considerably more expensive than many other televisions on the market. The motorized stands that make it truly unique will set you back at least another $895. But if price is no object and you want both a unique and beautiful television at the center of your living room, the Avant is hard to argue with.

If I want to take a photograph of something important to me, I want to choose a special product.” Photography has been around for close to 200 years and, despite the best efforts of innovative startups like Lytro, the basic idea behind a photograph hasn’t changed much. Cameras are a pretty mature technology — even our phones are capable of taking decent pictures nowadays. But that’s not to say that camera design is stagnant, or that the differences in philosophy can’t spark debate as passionate as the rivalry between fans of Fender and Gibson or Ferrari and Lamborghini. For those who treat photography as something more than recording simple snapshots, a favorite camera transcends gadgetry and becomes an extension of the body itself. “Cameras are capturing machines,” says Imai, “but they also express peoples’ minds.”    For a very long time, the conventional wisdom has been that if you want to take great photos, you buy a DSLR from Canon or Nikon. But cameras don’t need to be as big to achieve the same quality these days. Fujifilm has built up a strong reputation among photographers since it released the unique X100 in 2011, and the company’s X-series of mirrorless cameras are winning fans for their focus on physical controls, fast lenses, and head-turning design. The latest model, the X-T1, received a glowing review from The Verge last month; it’s Fujifilm’s best, most reliable camera to date, but also one that represents a stylistic shift for the company. And as the team behind the product tells me, every tiny detail was agonized over before it came to life. The X-T1’s new direction ran the risk of disappointing Fujifilm fans. Every X-series mirrorless camera to date had featured a slick, compact rangefinder-style design that took cues from the likes of Leica and Contax, but Fujifilm started afresh with a silhouette that looks much closer to an SLR. It’s an interesting move — while mirrorless cameras haven’t yet made much impact on DSLR sales, they play a similar role as light, travel-friendly rangefinders did in the film era. With the X-T1, however, Fujifilm is making a statement that its mirrorless cameras can compete on the same level as SLRs. Fujifilm’s first design challenge was striking a balance between SLR-style handling and mirrorless size. ""We started with three prime lenses with the X-Pro1, and they were all pretty small,"" says Toshi Iida, the X-series' product manager. ""But now we’re expanding into zoom lenses. If it got too big it’d lose the mirrorless advantage, so you have to have the right balance."" To this end, the X-T1 features a more substantial grip than any X camera to date, but it’s not oversized and doesn’t break the compact lines of the body too much. Imai showed me some early prototype sketches for the X-T1 that looked similar to regular DSLRs, with ergonomic, bulbous grips that would have made the camera an even greater departure from Fujifilm’s X-series lineage. ""Our X design is classic and authentic,"" says Imai. ""I could have chosen an ergonomic style but our X design is completely different. It’s flat and straight and based on ‘good-old-days’ camera style."" In particular, Fujifilm’s own Fujica ST901 from 1974 served as inspiration for Imai. ""Late ’70s to ’80s SLRs were very cool to me,"" he recalls. ""The ST901 was very small with a very characteristic finder, so this was very close to the X-T1 concept. Very simple, not so ergonomic — this was the basic inspiration."" The viewfinder is another prominent area where the X-T1 takes influence from SLRs — it’s housed in a hump in the middle of the body, directly above the lens. This is how Fujifilm was able to achieve the X-T1’s headline feature — the huge electronic viewfinder that displays a larger image than full-frame DSLRs. The X-T1 isn’t the first mirrorless camera to house an EVF inside a facsimile of an SLR prism hump, a look I’ve always thought came across as a little inauthentic and dishonest to the digital reality of these products. But Fujifilm says that the center-mounted viewfinder hump is not only there to improve handling; it wouldn’t be physically possible to fit anywhere else. The viewfinder uses a tiny 0.7-inch OLED display behind three pieces of glass, including one large element that’s aspherical on both sides. This is what gives the striking magnification effect, akin to putting a cinema screen inside the Tardis and peering in from the outside. ""We really wanted to break through the barrier of the viewfinder,"" says Iida. ""The EVF is always regarded as something inferior to the OVF, but we really wanted to change that perception."" For that to happen, Fujifilm had to improve the function of the electronic viewfinder as well as the form, tasking GUI designer Nanae Sakuma with making the most of the X-T1’s large display. She showed me some wild designs, like one that projected distance markings in 3D and another that simulated the focus screen on a film SLR, but ultimately the two major innovations are simple additions that anyone who uses an X-T1 will soon find hard to live without. The first is a mode that rotates the display and settings when the camera is held in portrait orientation, and the second uses the viewfinder’s size to place a smaller manual-focusing aid next to the larger display. Sakuma says she also used the viewfinder space to keep the main image as clutter-free as possible, placing exposure information outside the frame. While there are some for whom nothing less than a traditional optical viewfinder will suffice, the X-T1’s electronic unit is the most convincing yet. One area where Fujifilm didn’t budge is the classic, dial-heavy control scheme, which the company believes is a more efficient and enjoyable way to shoot than the abstracted, context-sensitive wheels used by nearly all its competitors. Imai traces the shift back to Minolta’s 1985 Alpha 7000 camera, the first to use autofocus and automatic film advance, and the designers compare this movement to the rise of automatic transmission in cars. ""The X series is a new combination, the dials and digital,"" says Imai. ""At first, film cameras with dials were common, then it changed to PASM with automatic cameras. Next came digital cameras with PASM that were also automatic. But now, we should be coming back to the standard."" These are cameras designed to be used manually by people who know what each physical control is for; there are no automatic sports or portrait modes as found on almost all competing models. ""Nowadays we don't need special technique, the camera does everything,"" says Iida. ""We think we should go back to basics. The photographer can control the camera, the camera doesn't control the photographer."" We were speaking before Leica revealed its touch-controlled T mirrorless system — it’s ironic that Fujifilm, whose cameras are so often compared to Leica, are now making products that have more in common with the German manufacturer’s typical output. Not everyone will prefer Fujifilm’s approach, and the X-T1’s design choices have sparked disagreement even among those who do. The team agonized over countless minor decisions that all add up, and it’s impossible to satisfy everyone. ""Basically we asked a lot of professional photographers,"" says Iida, ""and if we asked a hundred people, we’d probably get a hundred different answers."" The engineers decided to put a lock on the ISO dial because they thought it would be less frequently used, but they stiffened the exposure-compensation dial after feedback that it was too loose on the X100 and X-Pro1. ""Maybe in the future we can provide some kind of a service where the customer can come to our support center and we can customize that sort of thing,"" says Iida. ""Because there is no perfect answer."" One aspect of the X-T1 that photographers seem to hold in universal disdain, however, is the array of buttons on the camera’s rear; they’re almost flush with the body and have very little tactile response. Iida says this is partly because of the camera’s weather-sealing, and partly because raised buttons can be susceptible to accidental presses. ""But it is a little difficult to control — especially the focus point,"" he admits, with the face of a man who’s heard the criticism countless times. I wouldn’t expect any X-T1 successor to exhibit the same flaw. Fujifilm has built up a reputation for giving far better post-release support to its products than a typical camera maker, issuing transformative firmware updates to improve things like autofocus performance and customizable settings. The company also got out in front of a well-documented ""light leak"" issue affecting some models when taking long exposures with a light shining inside the open port door. ""It’s a little bit of a surprise to us that the customer is sensitive to this kind of issue,"" says Iida. ""But we recognized it and decided to offer [free repair] service as quickly as possible."" Iida denies scattered reports that Fujifilm is ""fixing"" the rear button response on affected models at the same time, however. Although the X-T1 feels like more of a complete package at launch than its predecessors, Imai says the team has already collated a list of 140 potential improvements based on customer feedback. The most requested addition is the ability to instantly select an autofocus point with the D-pad; right now you can customize each rear button to activate that mode before making your selection, but some would rather save the additional button press. ""There are pros and cons which we need to carefully check and investigate, but some of the points we think we should do as quickly as possible,"" says Imai. ""For example, the movie button — many customers say that this is too easy to press. So that is the kind of thing that we should improve as soon as possible."" Fujifilm plans to make this button customizable in a future update. But there’s one thing about the X-T1 that can never be changed — the size of its sensor. Full-frame cameras have been big news over the past couple of years; the Nikon D600 and Canon 6D broke price boundaries in 2012, and Sony’s RX1 compact and A7/A7R mirrorless cameras are the smallest to date. Fujifilm, meanwhile, released the X-Pro1 just over two years ago with a brand-new lens mount that — unlike Sony’s NEX design — can’t support full-frame sensors. Does the company regret this move? ""No,"" says Iida. ""If we tried to put the small mount on the big sensor… I think that Sony has had to compromise a lot, especially for the lens design and quality. So we designed just for APS-C to optimize the quality for the lens and the sensor. Of course full-frame has some good points, [but] a lot of negative points: the cost, the size, the lenses are big and expensive. When we talk with professional photographers, they don't care about the sensor size."" That’s not to say that a larger sensor is off Fujifilm’s radar entirely, though — ""Our R&D team is doing investigation,"" allows Iida. I wrap up our talk with an anecdote: The Verge’s director of operations and photographer extraordinaire, Michael Shane, is often talking about how he’d love to switch to Fujifilm cameras but can’t leave his full-frame Canon setup behind. How would the X-T1 team convince him? ""Why do you need full-frame?,"" Imai asks the absent Michael, who’d told me that since he takes a lot of portraits, he’s concerned about depth of field and dynamic range. ""I don’t know what kind of portraits he’s taking,"" says Iida. ""But the benefit of APS-C is that he can get much closer to the subject and use brighter and smaller lenses and a silent shutter, so I think he can change his shooting style. I don't think he can change overnight, but you know, maybe he can try the X-T1 alongside his full-frame camera. Maybe he'll gradually take more photos with the X-T1.""

First announced late last year, Reddit Notes were intended to be a way for the social news aggregator to give 10 percent of a recent funding round — some $5 million — to Reddit's users. But Alexis Ohanian, Reddit's executive chairman, said today that the company's research told it to ""wait until the law and technology around cryptocurrency are further along before deciding exactly how"" to issue Reddit Notes. The cryptocurrency was floated as an idea after a successful round of capital funding, which saw the company draw $50 million from investors such as Marc Andreesen. Reddit asked for suggestions for ways to give a chunk of that money back to its community in September. By December, it had made plans to create a cryptocurrency named Reddit Notes, and hired an engineer for the project. Reddit announced that it would give 950,000 Reddit Notes to users in a lottery, based on their activities prior to the end of September 2014, by the fall of 2015.  The company fired its lead cryptocurrency engineer, Ryan X. Charles, last week. In a post on Reddit itself after he was let go, Charles claimed he had been working on a Reddit Wallet that would let users deal in a number of cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin itself and Reddit darling dogecoin, in-browser. The project had been reportedly championed by ex-Reddit CEO Yishan Wong, who left the company in November last year. With Wong gone, Charles said he did not directly report to anyone inside the company. I was just let go from reddit because cryptocurrency is not a part of reddit's near-term plans. This is unfortunate, but understandable.  On Twitter, Charles stated that he was let go because ""cryptocurrency is not a part of reddit's near-term plans."" He characterized the new leadership as ""so uninterested in bitcoin"" that he believed the construction of Reddit's cryptofinancial system ""is not going to happen for a long time."" Lending credence to Charles' comments, Reddit has also removed all open cryptocurrency engineer roles from its job board. Ohanian declined to comment to The Verge directly, but maintained in his Y Combinator post that the company will eventually issue the cryptocurrency. The executive chairman stated that Reddit wanted to give its community ""the full value of the equity when they receive it in the future,"" but was also careful to note that the company had been ""unable to do that with current cryptocurrency regulations.""",0.294995569647449,0.705004430352551,0.8622529644060609,430,5.0116279069767442,246,5.8414634146341466,0,0,"Business, Culture, Web"

""Harry Heymann, former SVP of engineering, will be stepping down at the end of the week after more than 5 years leading engineering for the company,"" a spokeswoman told The Verge in an email. ""He will remain an advisor to Foursquare."" Heymann is a longtime ally of Foursquare founder Dennis Crowley who worked together with him on its predecessor, Dodgeball. After joining Foursquare in 2009, Heymann was responsible for staffing and managing much of the company's engineering organization. Business Insider once called him ""the behind-the-scenes grind-it-out true believer holding the thing together."" Heymann previously spent five years at Google, where he worked on Dodgeball, Google Checkout, and advertising products, according to his LinkedIn profile. Before that, he worked at Microsoft and Intel. Uncertainty as Foursquare pivots into a Yelp-like search engine Heymann joins a list of Foursquare executives that have left over the past year that include spokesman Brendan Lewis, chief operating officer Evan Cohen, and head of business development Holger Luedorf. Heymann's departure comes eight months after Foursquare split off its check-in based social networking functions into a separate app, Swarm, that has struggled to gain momentum. One one hand, Heymann worked for Foursquare longer than most, and no one would begrudge him for wanting to do something new after five years. At the same time, given his long association with Crowley and the company, it's a symbolic loss for the company at a time when its prospects are less certain than ever. The Verge first inquired about Heymann's employment status at Foursquare last month. At the time, a spokesman confirmed Heymann had stepped down from his role leading the engineering organization late last year, but said he would stay on to help build Swarm. Andrew Hogue, who previously led Foursquare's search team, took over engineering. But just three weeks later, Heymann's LinkedIn profile says he is ""somewhere new.""

""We have lots of cash and ramping revenue,"" Picturelife CEO Nate Westheimer said in a tweet. ""All signs say we will last :D Would love you have your business!"" But just a few months later, Westheimer acknowledged the difficult economics of storage-based businesses. Like Everpix, Picturelife’s millions of photos were stored on Amazon Web Services servers — and its costs were growing quickly. ""Picturelife, a relatively nascent company, will pay Amazon over $1 million just this year,"" Westheimer wrote. ""The way I see it, it’s a million dollars standing in the way of thriving and sending them even more money in the future."" Westheimer’s post was prescient. On Thursday, he sold Picturelife to digital media hub Streamnation for an undisclosed sum. All but two of the company’s eight employees, Westheimer included, will leave the company. And while Picturelife will continue to operate, its failure to remain independent is telling: it may be simply impossible to build a standalone billion-dollar business based around storing people’s photos. ""This isn’t a product like Snapchat; it doesn’t take off overnight,"" Westheimer told me. ""So you need that financial durability in the early years, while you’re still building your customer base."" ""This isn't a product like Snapchat. It doesn't take off overnight."" The idea behind companies like Picturelife is simple: every year, we take more photos and store them in more places. There’s your phone’s camera roll, Facebook, and Instagram. But there are also photos you posted on Twitter, stored on Dropbox, or shared on Flickr. There’s the photo library on your laptop that you keep forgetting to back up. And so starting a few years ago, a handful of companies emerged to take all those photos and put them in a central place. Picturelife had raised $4.6 million from investors including Betaworks and SV Angel. In its first 15 months, the company attracted 200,000 subscribers. (The company wouldn’t say how many were paid users.) But this fall, when Westheimer went out to raise a new round of funding from investors, he was met with unrelenting skepticism. ""There was a lot of scared thinking in the investment community,"" Westheimer says. ""On one hand they would say, this space is so crowded, these giants are going to kill you. But every entrepreneur hears that. What’s weird is, two sentences later they’d then use those same companies that were supposedly going to crush us as examples of how hard it was to succeed in the space — because even they weren’t successful.""   At this point, every major tech company offers some sort of photo service for storage or sharing. But none are as fully featured, or easy to use, as Picturelife is. Apple’s Photo Stream is all but incomprehensible to me. Google’s photo product, while very good, is buried inside Google+. Amazon’s photo storage service, tied to Prime, is just getting started. Facebook’s service is designed more for sharing photos than for organizing them. Dropbox’s Carousel seems to exist for the sole purpose of helping people consume their Dropbox storage. We upload 1.8 billion photos a day No wonder people keep building superior services: it’s impossible to store your photos with Apple, or Google, or Amazon, and not imagine you could do it better. And the need grows larger every day. Last year, trend forecaster Mary Meeker of Kleiner Perkins estimated that we upload 1.8 billion photos to the internet a day, up from 500 million the year before. But while services like Picturelife have attracted thousands of paying customers — I’m one of them — they haven’t found enough to build a sustainable business. In December, investor and writer Om Malik wrote about the desperate need for a photo solution that goes beyond storing your photos and actually helps you enjoy them. ""What the world needs is not filters to apply cool effects to the photos but filters to surface photos,"" he wrote. ""Right now it is virtually impossible to find that photo from six months ago, even though you have a vague recollection that you took that photo."" Big tech companies are focused on other things, Malik wrote. ""And that leaves the opportunity wide for startups."" But the startups keep dying. First Everpix went under. Then Loom, a kind of infinite camera roll, sold to Dropbox and formed the basis for Carousel. Now Picturelife belongs to StreamNation, which aspires to become the hub for all your digital files: movies, music, and photos. The good news for Picturelife subscribers is that it will continue being actively developed — albeit with a mostly new team. Jonathan Benassaya, the exuberant French founder of StreamNation, bristled at any suggestion that the 250 million photos stored on Picturelife are at risk. ""I’m leading this company with my heart,"" he says. ""And I take it personally when people don’t trust us to be able to keep Picturelife alive. It’s my mission. I have two kids; my wife and I are using Picturelife every day with our families in Europe and Asia. It’s a product we don’t want to see go away."" ""I'm leading this company with my heart."" Benassaya previously co-founded Deezer, the European music streaming service that has recently made tentative moves into the United States. For now, Benassaya is bootstrapping StreamNation, a worrisome proposition for anyone who has already watched a few favored photo services wither away. But he says he has advantages over services like Everpix and Loom. For starters, he says, a true digital media hub is easier to sell than a dedicated photo service. Americans spend about $3 billion a year to build personal media servers in their homes, Benassaya says, and that market is ripe to be transformed by the cloud. ""If you take the consumer market, and you see what sits on their hard drive, it’s mainly media,"" he says. ""Why would you want to offer them a service where they have to use one service for movies, one service for photos, and one service for music? We want to be able to access all our content on whatever device we want, whenever we want."" Perhaps more importantly, StreamNation is storing content on its own servers: a more difficult proposition than AWS, but apparently a much cheaper one. ""Today Picturelife on Amazon is a huge monthly loss,"" Benassaya says. ""Today PIcturelife, on our platform, is generating margin. And this is how you transform, just by making the right technological choice from the beginning."" Picturelife will be six times cheaper to host on StreamNation’s own servers than it was on AWS, Benassaya says. The end of dedicated photo storage apps Westheimer, for his part, is optimistic about Picturelife’s future — even though he won’t be a part of it. Customers, he says, ""can rely purely on the perseverance of a very determined entrepreneur. I think that’s an incredible amount of security for the business."" Looking back, he says, he now believes people will be drawn more to all-in-one services like StreamNation than to a dedicated photo app. And perhaps that’s true, rationally. But emotionally, it feels false. When your house is burning down, you don’t run back in to get your music and movies. You run back in to get your photos. So far, no one has been able to build a beautiful digital home for our photos and turn it into a sustainable, independent business.

The move was particularly perplexing because it seemed like Google was undercutting the wireless operators it was trying to partner with in advance of its Android launch. Why would it throw billions at a bid to steal spectrum out from underneath the very companies it was trying to work with? Early the following year, we had the answer: Google had a policy agenda. It didn’t win any spectrum — most of it went to Verizon — but by placing bids, it accomplished what it had set out to do, meeting the minimum bid necessary to trigger the Commission’s open device rules. It didn’t want spectrum; it never did. It wanted to make the market more favorable for launching Android devices. Self-driving tech still needs all the help it can get Fast forward to 2015, and self-driving cars are meeting many of the same headwinds that next-generation wireless networks were meeting in the mid-aughts. Necessary rules and standards don’t exist. There’s still research to do. Pillars of the private and public sectors are jockeying to lead the conversation, to plot the path to commercialization. This week, Uber has announced a self-driving research initiative in partnership with Carnegie Mellon, while Google is rumored to be investigating ride-sharing using its own self-driving cars. At a glance, as many have speculated, it would appear the two are about to go to war — but cast in the light of Google’s wireless maneuvers nearly a decade ago, the story looks very different. @business We think you'll find Uber and Lyft work quite well. We use them all the time.  As in 2007, Google’s priorities for self-driving cars remain in research and policymaking. And it can’t be overstated just how much more work is necessary to make them a viable reality — particularly Google’s vision of an autonomous, steering wheel-free box on wheels. They can’t handle inclement weather, which is particularly troubling for us Northerners getting walloped with record-breaking blizzards in the past couple weeks. They struggle to make quick, human-like decisions at intersections without compromising safety. Urban environments are still far more troublesome than highways are — and through all of this, we still don’t know who’s responsible when a self-driving car crashes. US Department of Transportation secretary Anthony Foxx sounds hip to autonomous driving tech, but that’s step one in a long, arduous road to standardizing rules that would allow self-driving cars on the road nationwide. So, does it help Uber to have Google — which, again, is an enormous investor in Uber — pushing hard on both the technological and regulatory aspects of autonomous driving? Unequivocally yes. Indeed, a Wall Street Journal report suggests that Google's ride-sharing efforts with self-driving cars are, at least at first, simply intended for internal use to ferry employees to work. For the rest of us, in even the most blue-sky view, fully autonomous self-driving cars won’t be picking us up from our homes on a broad scale until 2020. In the meantime, automakers, Uber, and regulators need all the help they can get figuring out how this stuff works.",0.45245276766893244,0.5475472323310675,0.7004451319214994,562,5.1352313167259789,331,6.1782477341389725,0,0,"Business, Transportation, Editorial"

Staples will be paying Office Depot's shareholders with a mixture of cash and stock for a value of $11 per share. The deal is expected to close by the end of this calendar year, with Staples expecting to generate more than $1 billion in ""annualized cost synergies"" by the third full fiscal year.

At most large companies, every email that gets sent is archived and stored forever. As personal and professional lives bleed together on our mobile devices, Sony executives intermingled nasty industry gossip and racist Obama jokes with the day-to-day conversations concerning actual work. Teens have already learned that ephemeral messaging can help avoid embarrassment. But is Snapchat for business a viable solution to corporations' privacy woes, or just a rush to cash in on a buzzy trend? Confide, a New York startup, is one of several companies that believes there is a big opportunity to bring this new communication paradigm to the suit-and-tie set.  The app, launched in December of 2013, lets users send screenshot-proof self-destructing messages. Today it’s announcing a new feature that allows you to share images and documents. ""We built this to address the gap in today’s communications, to give adults a way to use email and texts messages that was safe and ephemeral."" says CEO Jon Brod.  A crowded market for secure work chat The new feature is a precursor to the launch of Confide’s enterprise version, which Brod says will arrive in the next few months. So far the service has been free, but with its business class, Confide hopes to charge an annual licensing fee. It’s not alone. Digify, which sells a similar self-destructing service, is planning to launch its enterprise version in the first half of this year. They join companies like Vaporstream, Tigertext, and Gryphn's ArmorText, all of which pitch themselves to professionals as secure alternatives to your typical chat app. When users send text on Confide, the words are covered up like the redacted sections of a classified document. You swipe your finger across the screen to read the message a few words at a time. With documents and images, most of the message is blurred out, and you scroll up and down to see just a small section at once. On top of this visual obstacle, the app kicks out and reports users who try to screenshot a message, while also deleting that item from their inbox.  Confide says it never stores any user data on its servers. Instead it relies on end-to-end encryption, the same technique used by services like iMessage and WhatsApp. ""How do we make sure the message is really gone?"" asks Confide co-founder and CTO Howard Lerman. ""The answer is you never have it in the first place."" Confide messages that arrive on users' phones are briefly stored locally in flash memory and erased after they've been viewed. ""I think of the cloud as a drunken copier machine spewing out replicas of your data,"" says Lerman. ""And people don’t really have control over it."" ""I think of the cloud as a drunken copier machine."" To employees, an app that deletes their questionable jokes may seem like an ideal solution. But for large corporations, there are legal concerns. ""Most companies want to create a paper trail,"" says Chris Camejo, director of assessment for NTT Com Security. ""Email doesn’t have to be permanent. From a security perspective, impermanent is better. But ephemeral is incompatible with the way most businesses want to operate."" Confide says that for now it's targeting industries which aren’t heavily regulated. By sticking with tech, media, and sports, it can avoid any issues around data retention. Other apps, like ArmorText and TigerText, work with companies in the worlds of finance, health care, and government. They delete messages from your mobile device, but archive an encrypted audit trail for a number of years to ensure companies don’t violate any laws. Digify, a startup headquartered in Redwood City, California, says clients are often looking to send blueprints, designs, and other intellectual property that is not yet public. ""What our users want is control,"" says founder and CEO Augustine Lim. ""Traditionally when you send stuff to someone, the receiving party can do what they like. With our service the sender can lend out files for a limited amount of time."" ""I’m worried companies like this are making promises that are impossible to keep."" But as NTT’s Camejo points out, no matter how good your technology is, there are still simple, low-tech loopholes. ""What is stopping someone from recording a video of their screen as they scroll through a message or document?"" Camejo asks. ""I’m worried companies like this are making promises that are impossible to keep."" Lim acknowledges that no digital communication is truly safe from being recorded and shared. While his service prevents the device from creating a digital copy, screenshot, or screen recording, it can’t stop recipients from simply taking a photo or video with an external camera.  ""People call this the analog hole. Hollywood has been trying to solve it for a long time."" The best Digify can offer is a way to track your files, so you know exactly who made and distributed any copies. Spared a costly apology tour ""Of course you can 'cheat' and do that, just like you can secretly record a private conversation or a phone call,"" says Brod, when asked about video recordings. ""What Confide does is simply turn the default digital modality to off the record instead of on the record."" Since watercooler gossip has already moved to text and email, he argues, why not do it more safely? These services wouldn’t have prevented the Sony hack or the leak of unreleased films. But if executives had used self-destructing services for their nasty gossip and ill-advised jokes, they would likely have been spared their costly apology tour. Eventually, say Confide’s founders, they hope it will evolve beyond an app to become a platform, so that any email or chat service can offer a ""confidential"" option that piggybacks on their technology. The company may prove to be the best test case for how well its service really works. ""I scream at people in the office. I tell them, ‘You fucked up!’ That’s what running a company is like,"" says Lerman. ""There is no way I would put that in an email because later they would send it to someone and say, ‘Look what an asshole this guy is.’ Now with Confide I can scream at my employees all day long.""",0.5560192287347627,0.4439807712652373,0.5231382284425454,1069,4.9869036482694105,579,6.1554404145077717,0,0,"Business, Tech, Report"

Throughout the month, Bill will be sharing his vision of how technology will revolutionize life for the world's poor by 2030 by narrating episodes of the Big Future, our animated explainer series. In addition, we'll be publishing a series of features exploring the improvements in banking, health, farming, and education that will enable that revolution. And while the topics reflect the bets Bill and his wife Melinda are making with their foundation, they've asked us for nothing less than fully independent Verge journalism, which we're more than happy to deliver. Turns out Bill Gates is a pretty confident guy. Nilay Patel, Editor-in-Chief In the village of Sori along the banks of Kenya’s Lake Victoria, fishing has long been the lynchpin of the local economy. Jobs here are largely divided by gender: men catch the fish, and the women process the meat, take it to market, and handle finances. As detailed in a 2012 study from the SIT Graduate Institute, residents of Sori traditionally kept their money at home. Theft was a constant concern, and many of the women interviewed reported their husbands misappropriating their savings. For many, traditional banks were either too far away, or demanded minimum deposits the villagers could not afford. All that changed in 2007 with the introduction of M-PESA, a mobile service that allows Kenyans to store and transfer their money using only a cell phone. Funds can be exchanged over the network using SMS messages, meaning it works on almost any mobile phone. M-PESA agents spread throughout the country allow users to convert their credit to cash and deposit or withdraw from their accounts. The majority of Sori women interviewed for the study now keep their savings in M-PESA accounts, safe from criminals and wasteful purchases. M-PESA also revolutionized how the women sold their goods. Prior to M-PESA, the women worked only in cash. To sell their fish, the women would have to travel by bus to markets, trips that cost them money and time. Since the adoption of M-PESA, the women send the fish to market by bus and receive payment remotely. ""Where it may have taken a woman a week to sell two bags of fish in Nairobi, she now spends one morning buying and sending the fish on a bus to Nairobi for sale by her customers,"" reports the study. With their newfound savings, women reported being able to make long-term investments: sending their children to better schools and building themselves more durable homes to withstand seasonal floods. When we asked Bill Gates to edit The Verge this month, he pointed to digital banking solutions like M-PESA as a technology that will revolutionize the lives of the poor in the near future. ""In the next 15 years, digital banking will give the poor more control over their assets and help them transform their lives,"" he wrote in his annual letter. ""By 2030, 2 billion people who don’t have a bank account today will be storing money and making payments with their phones. And by then, mobile money providers will be offering the full range of financial services, from interest-bearing savings accounts to credit to insurance."" Mobile money is a fast-growing industry across many parts of the developing world. But can it really transform the lives of those living on just a few dollars a day? Of the 2.5 billion people in the world who have no access to a traditional bank, approximately 1 billion have a mobile phone. The widespread adoption of mobile phones has enabled some of the poorest economies on earth to leapfrog ahead of developed nations when it comes to tech-driven financial solutions. A report in The Atlantic noted that adults in Sub-Saharan Africa are three times more likely to use mobile money as their counterparts in Europe and the Americas. In fact, another recent report found nine African nations now have more mobile pay accounts than traditional bank accounts. Kenya is frequently cited as a successful example of how mobile money can dramatically transform a country’s economy. In 2006, less than 30 percent of adults in the country had access to formal financial services. Thanks to M-PESA, today that figure stands above 65 percent. Developed by telecom giants Vodafone and Safaricom with the blessing of the Central Bank of Kenya, by 2010 M-PESA was considered the most successful mobile money service in the developing world. In 2014, the service processed over $20 billion in transactions, a figure equal to more than 40 percent of the nation’s GDP. Widespread adoption has bolstered Kenya’s economy, says Dr. William Jack, a professor of economics at Georgetown who, along with Dr. Tavneet Suri of the MIT Sloan School of Management, has studied the service and published several papers on its impact. ""There is unequivocal proof that M-PESA has a positive impact on people’s financial health."" Those financial benefits convinced many, including the Gates Foundation, that mobile money was a powerful tool in the fight against global poverty. ""People being able to participate on their phone, no matter where they live, even if they’re in a remote rural village in Tanzania or Kenya, they’ll be able to save small micro-payments,"" Gates told The Verge during an interview in New York. ""They can participate on the economy through their phone, but also in the fall when it’s time to pay the school fees, they’ve saved the money for the year. That’s transformative for their family."" But as banks, governments, and telecommunication companies have learned, replicating the success of M-PESA in other developing nations is not so simple. Between 2010 and 2013, mobile money services began a push to expand in countries like India, Nigeria, and Brazil, but onlookers were dismayed by the pace of adoption. ""There have been about 200 of these experiments around the world, and maybe only four or five have been successful,"" Michael Joseph, director of mobile commerce at Vodafone, told Financial Times. ""People saw what happened in Kenya and were excited for mobile money to take the rest of the world by storm,"" says Claudia McKay, a senior financial sector specialist with CGAP. ""People thought it was this magic service that would pull us all out of poverty, but it wasn’t working like it did in Kenya anywhere else in the world. Do you know the hype cycle? Well the last few years have been our trough of disillusionment."" One of the primary reasons M-PESA took off so rapidly was that it was offered by Safaricom, the nation’s dominant mobile carrier. ""People had already come to trust them with their money,"" says Dr. Jack. ""And the lack of competition, and fragmentation, made it much simpler to grow."" Kenya’s institutional dysfunction also proved to be an advantage when it came to mobile money adoption. An underdeveloped banking industry, unreliable roads, and an unstable government made M-PESA an appealing option. ""All the reasons it worked there are the same reasons that it wouldn’t work if you tried to bring it to the more developed and tightly regulated markets,"" says Peter Wennemacher, a mobile banking analyst with Forrester Research. ""The government and the financial institutions [in Kenya] were comfortable with a lot more risk."" That risk included the use of M-PESA by criminals to move illicit proceeds. Laundering dirty money was now as simple as sending a text message. ""Most countries would hesitate to help a massive channel for illegal transfers like that to develop,"" says Abhishek Chauhan, a mobile banking analyst with Frost & Sullivan. ""People were aware that this was being used by drug lords and smugglers."" ""The Central Bank took a very hands-off approach,"" says Dr. Jack. For example, regulators tolerated a near complete lack of deposit insurance. The bank accounts that M-PESA stored funds in were federally insured for 100,000 Kenyan shillings. But Safaricom pooled everyone’s deposits together into just a few accounts. In the event of default, it would be impossible to pay everyone back or determine who got some of the small amount covered by insurance. Additionally, in countries like India, where a robust banking sector already exists, mobile payments have been less successful. There, the ability to launch mobile payment services was restricted to established incumbents. ""The banks are inclined to protect their existing revenue streams; there is less motivation to innovate,"" says Wennemacher. ""And to be fair, there are a lot of regulatory pressures that some of the tech innovators don’t face."" After the trough of disillusionment comes the slope of enlightenment, and there is good reason to believe that in the last two years, mobile money has found its stride, learning from its mistakes in the post-M-PESA boom. There are now well-established markets with multiple competitors across Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Research from the Groupe Speciale Mobile Association (GSMA), which has received funding from the Gates Foundation, shows the number of mobile money services across the globe expanding from just 64 in 2010 to 255 at the end of 2014. In Bangladesh, where state-sanctioned mobile money services launched in 2010, mobile money services have more than tripled in size over the last two years. A similar story has played out in the archipelago nation of the Philippines, where a trip to the nearest bank can take days and may require a boat ride. A 2012 IMF study found that not only was mobile money far faster and safer than traditional banking in the Philippines, but it was also less expensive: fees on remittance using banks averaged 2.5-10 percent; on mobile, that same transaction had an average fee of just 1 percent. But whether or not mobile payments can significantly address global poverty is up for debate. ""I think there is some evidence that the basic deposit, withdraw, and send functions help poor people to have more choices, more convenience, more privacy, and more security in their financial lives,"" says CGAP’s McKay. ""But people thought it was a magic service that would pull us all out of poverty. I would not say that mobile money in and of itself is going to pull people out of poverty. That would be going too far."" In the short term, mobile banking could address a number of critical issues, including corruption. ""When you’re dealing in cash in economies with a lot of corruption, half of your wages are gone before you see that money,"" says Julie Ask, an analyst with Forrester Research who has written extensively on mobile money. ""With the government using mobile to pay your wages, you can avoid a lot of that."" Afghanistan has paid policemen with a local variant of M-PESA, and Tanzania accepts taxes over mobile. And in the longterm, experts believe layering additional services on top of a basic mobile financial platform could make a significant impact on poverty. In Kenya, M-PESA has begun partnering with banks and companies to offer a richer array of services and financial products. ""Once these services get going, then there will be competitive innovation in offerings like special savings or credit plans related to farming or education,"" says the Gates letter. In Kenya that looks like M-Shwari, a partnership between M-PESA and the Commercial Bank of Africa. In the two years since it launched, M-Shwari has attracted 9 million customers with a combined $1.47 billion in savings. Customers can earn interest on their money and, if they develop good credit, access loans to help them make big purchases or start a business. Utilities are another service being layered on top of mobile money. In many parts of rural Kenya, villages aren’t on the electrical grid — 35 million people depend on kerosene lamps for light and borrow power from car batteries to charge cell phones. Now, a company called M-KOPA is offering Kenyans low-cost solar panels, and M-PESA is at the heart of their business. M-KOPA sells its devices for a small down payment, about $30, with the rest paid out in installments over a year. Inside each solar panel is a SIM card connected to a nationwide cell network powered by Safaricom. People can use M-PESA to pay their bills. If they miss a payment, they can’t draw power, but can easily switch that back on when their finances stabilize. The flexibility of this system has allowed a population to access modern energy that was previously out of reach. At the end of their letter, Bill and Melinda Gates note that the innovation in mobile money will eventually ""trickle up"" from developing to developed nations. Indeed, mobile banking innovation is also happening in the United States in response to banks increasingly abandoning lower-income customers. A mix of new regulations and record low interest rates means small savings accounts are no longer profitable for traditional banks in the US. As a result, more and more Americans are joining the ranks of the unbanked. In New York City, a startup called One Financial is trying serve these individuals and recreate the success of M-PESA. ""After the financial crisis, a lot of major banks shut down branches in less wealthy neighborhoods because they weren’t as profitable,"" explains One Financial co-founder Vinay Patel. That has led to the closing of nearly 2,000 bank branches, more than 90 percent of which were in poor neighborhoods. ""For many of their customers, that now means they don’t have a bank and are served only by check-cashing and payday loan stores with extremely high fees."" Patel says that even though the old banking model with expensive branches and extensive infrastructure is no longer viable within low-income communities, on mobile it can still be a profitable market segment. One Financial is hoping to offer customers a virtual bank that exists primarily as a phone app. They can use a mobile device to deposit checks, receive their wages directly, check their balance, or transfer funds. A debit card takes care of paying at merchants and withdrawing cash from ATMs. As Gates told The Verge, ""It starts to be economic to bank the very poorest. Not with branches or ATMs, but simply with the cellphone."" He further elaborated the point in his letter, noting that ""because there is strong demand for banking among the poor, and because the poor can in fact be a profitable customer base, entrepreneurs in developing countries are doing exciting work."" That’s increasingly true no matter what part of the world you live in — anywhere traditional banks can’t or won’t serve a large portion of the populace, the technology in our pockets is helping fill the gap.

Operating profit is forecast at ¥178.3 billion ($1.51 billion), and revenue is expected to have increased 6 percent year on year to ¥2.56 trillion ($21.7 billion). Sony has revised its forecast for the financial year ending in March; it still expects to make a net loss, but now estimates that it will be ¥170 billion ($1.44 billion) after previously predicting ¥230 billion.  More layoffs hit the mobile division The Xperia smartphone business continues to struggle; Sony is laying off 2,100 workers by March 2016 having previously announced 1,000 cuts, meaning the division will shrink by around 30 percent in total. Sales were actually up slightly year on year with a small operating profit, but new mobile chief Hiroki Totoki is implementing a restructuring plan designed to streamline the company's smartphone strategy. 4K sets have boosted Sony’s TV business, meanwhile, helping it turn a profit for three straight months for the first time in over a decade. The gaming division continues to perform well, with strong PlayStation 4 sales and income from network services driving a 17 percent increase in revenue. Sales have also been helped across the board by a weaker yen. Sony Pictures posts slim projected profit The cyberattack itself, which authorities believe was orchestrated by North Korea, hasn’t made much impact on Sony’s bottom line. Sony is putting aside 15 million dollars (¥1.8 billion) in ""investigation and remedial costs"" connected to the hack and, despite a projected 11.7 percent decrease in revenue put down to fewer home entertainment releases and less box-office take, Sony Pictures still made a slim estimated operating profit of ¥2.4 billion ($20.4 million) for the quarter.",0.2747838251889294,0.7252161748110706,0.8656197513816082,350,5.2685714285714287,224,5.96875,0,0,"Business, Entertainment, Gaming, Home, Mobile, Tech"

Bloomberg says that the Seattle-based e-commerce giant is considering using the stores as showrooms for its hardware, and as pick-up and drop-off centers for items purchased online. Both Amazon and Radio Shack declined to comment on the situation, but two people apparently familiar with the matter said that Amazon may use the locations to give people a chance to try its growing range of hardware, including its range of Kindle tablets, its Fire smartphone, and its new Echo speaker. RadioShack was suspended from the New York Stock Exchange today Radio Shack has been hemorrhaging money for the past two years, and saw its shares, which had been at less than $1 since November, drop 13 percent on Monday to $0.24. The 92-year-old company was suspended from trading on the New York Stock Exchange today after it notified the exchange it did not intend to submit a business plan, a move that sees it slip further towards bankruptcy. Amazon isn't the only company interested in the ailing RadioShack — mobile carrier Sprint has reportedly discussed purchasing between 1,300 and 2,000 of the company's 4,000-plus US stores, and may co-brand the venues with both companies' names. Where tech competitors like Apple have maintained a glitzy retail presence in shopping areas for years, Amazon has kept most of its storefronts online, only occasionally opening pop-up stores in malls to show off specific hardware. The company has apparently toyed with the idea of a physical presence on shopping streets — reports surfaced late last year that the company would open a store in New York's Midtown in time for the holidays, but the store never materialized. Should Amazon lock in a deal for RadioShack's stores, it will mark the company's biggest foray into traditional brick-and-mortar retail, and — with the shells of a once-huge electrical retailer occupied by the company that helped force them out of the market — act as a fairly ironic reminder of the meteoric growth of internet shopping.",0.5010821807091883,0.4989178192908117,0.8284798158010416,361,5.1523545706371188,217,6.0552995391705071,0,0,"Business, Tech"

As revealed in a series of leaked emails, executives waffled on whether or not they should file a comment with the Federal Communications Commission to present their view. Ultimately, Sony declined to file because of concerns that it was difficult to get the entirety of Sony on the same page, that Sony may not be able to add much value to the discussion, and that Sony could end up burning some bridges.  Sony doesn't want to be equal to ""mom and pop"" streaming services But during the months leading up to the comment filing deadline in mid-September, Sony executives were still discussing what they would write in a filing, should they decide to comment. While there was no final consensus, Sony appeared to move more and more toward supporting paid fast lanes as the September deadline approached. The emails appear to have been first highlighted by The Daily Caller. Sony declined to comment. Sony Pictures and other Sony units such as Crackle ""are in the premium content business and do not want to be on equal footing with a random 'mom and pop' video streaming service,"" Keith Weaver, Sony Pictures' executive vice president of worldwide government affairs, wrote in early July. About a week later, Jim Morgan, Sony Electronics' government counsel, wrote that he was cutting out comments that touched on fast lanes because ""[Sony Pictures Entertainment] or other parts of Sony may want to take advantage of paid prioritization, and so doesn’t want to be constrained by any arguments we make in these comments."" Basically, Sony writes that it can see itself wanting to use paid fast lanes to help its many content businesses, be it delivering video games, movies, or something else. In an undated document that was released as part of the Sony hack, Sony sums up its general position on a number of subjects, including net neutrality. The statement is worded so as to appear at first that Sony is supporting net neutrality — ""the public internet should first be preserved"" — but it goes on to say that ""broadband providers and over-the-top service providers should be free to utilize specialized/priority services to advance their business interests."" The document explains that Sony would like the rules to be reevaluated ""from time to time"" to consider granting exceptions to the rules for ""data-intensive services."" Alongside the discussion of fast lanes, Sony Pictures executives were also focused on net neutrality's implications for piracy. When it comes to net neutrality's ""no blocking"" rule, Sony Pictures wanted to see that it was worded so that service providers were still allowed to block illegal content, such as pirated films. (This is, in fact, how the FCC ended up wording that provision.) Sony also brought up concerns about being affiliated with Imgur, BitTorrent, and Reddit were it to sign an open letter, issued early in the net neutrality process, asking the FCC to take a stance. Major tech firms, including Microsoft, Google, and Facebook had all signed the letter.

Both the Justice Department and the FCC are said to be moving toward approval, having found no major issues with the merger. While it doesn't appear that the deal will be blocked, regulators reportedly may choose to put conditions on it, potentially preventing the combined company from abusing its power in the emerging online TV space. The Journal reports that the conditions being considered are viewed as acceptable to AT&T. An official decision may not arrive for several more weeks.  AT&T's commitment to building out rural broadband may help its cause On the surface, the deal's approval seems to be a marked departure from the language heard from regulators just a few weeks ago when the Comcast–Time Warner Cable merger was called off. Federal Communications Commission chairman called that proposal an ""unacceptable risk to competition and innovation."" This merger is something of a different story, however. Rather than creating an internet service juggernaut, the combination of AT&T and DirecTV will instead have a domination in pay TV. That'll allow the combined company to have serious bargaining power when it comes to content licensing. But it'll also allow the company to market its internet and TV services in a stronger way: as a bundle. That may help it to attract and retain customers, potentially encouraging expansion of both services. That's also a big part of the reason regulators appear to like this merger. AT&T has already committed to ""build and enhance"" high-speed internet service to 15 million customers, primarily in rural areas, if this deal goes through. These are areas that AT&T largely doesn't serve with high-speed internet right now, and getting faster service out there will help the FCC move closer to its goals of connecting more of rural America and eventually achieving universal access to broadband. It could also increase overall competition. AT&T says that this project would be completed within four years of the merger closing. Some of the biggest concerns around the AT&T–DirecTV deal have hovered around what it could do to squeeze out online video providers like Netflix. As the largest pay TV company and one of the largest internet providers, the combined company would have the ability to discourage consumers from canceling cable and getting their TV online; it could apply data caps, for example, to make cable look more appealing. Netflix actually told regulators last week that it isn't comfortable with the merger unless changes are made. Given the growth in online TV right now (and the FCC's actions to foster it), it wouldn't be surprising to see conditions that address these concerns be put forward.",0.516975056512901,0.483024943487099,0.5225949451092509,459,5.174291938997821,266,6.1315789473684212,0,0,"Policy & Law, US & World"

The practice is known as ""cramming,"" and with today's announcement, the Federal Communications Commission has now made cramming settlements with all four major wireless carriers — AT&T settled in October for $105 million, and T-Mobile settled in December for $90 million. Of today's $158 million, $90 million will come from Verizon and $68 million will come from Sprint.  All four major carriers have now settled over cramming The majority of the money will go toward setting up refund programs to give money back to consumers who were hit with unauthorized charges. These charges came from premium text messaging services, which might send information like horoscopes or celebrity gossip, and usually ran about $9.99 per month. Verizon would keep 30 percent of their fees, and Sprint would keep 35 percent. The trouble is, consumers quite often didn't sign up for them, and carriers wouldn't always offer refunds. The FCC says that when it asked carriers for evidence that their customers signed up for premium texting services, they ""were unable to prove that these services were ever requested."" Verizon and Sprint are now no longer allowed to charge consumers for premium text messages. They will also now have to implement systems to ensure they obtain a customer's informed consent before allowing third-party charges. Both Verizon and Sprint, however, already began ending these charges a couple years back. ""Today’s settlement reflects Verizon’s continued focus on putting customers first,"" Verizon writes in a statement emailed to The Verge. Verizon says that it ""rigorously protected"" customers from these authorized charges, which, if true, seems like a significant failure. Verizon also says that it had a ""broad policy"" of allowing refunds on premium text message charges. Maybe the problem is a warped understanding of what it means to put your customer first? ""Sprint was an industry leader in enacting rigorous safeguards to protect customers against unauthorized billing by [premium SMS] merchants,"" Sprint writes in a statement emailed to The Verge. Sprint also says that it ""always put its customers’ interests first,"" and that it returned ""tens of millions of dollars"" in refunds long before this investigation began. At least $70 million of Verizon's settlement and at least $50 million of Sprint's settlement will go toward customer refund programs. They will also pay fines to the US Treasury, of $4 million and $6 million, respectively. The remainder will go to state governments. ""Consumers rightfully expect their monthly phone bills will reflect only those services that they’ve purchased,"" Travis LeBlanc, the FCC Enforcement Bureau chief, says in a statement. ""Today’s settlements put in place strong protections that will prevent consumers from being victimized by these kinds of practices in the future."" The FCC sounds fairly happy with the announcement of these actions. Cramming has been a big complaint from consumers, and the commission now appears to have accomplished the job of weeding it out from the biggest carriers in the US. Though Verizon and Sprint may have already ended the programs that enabled cramming, these settlements should ensure that their customers will actually end up getting their money back.

If that doesn't concern video game publishers, it should. While publishers stress about protecting new releases with irritating digital rights managements ""solutions,"" older games may be downloaded from dozens if not hundreds of websites reachable with a quick Google search. For the past decade, the de facto strategy of pubs has been defensive: send these sites takedown requests, threaten legal action, move on to the next mole in need of whacking. In 2015, video game piracy is fast and easy Rare Replay, released this week for Xbox One, puts the three-decade-old developer on the offensive, countering illegal downloads by incentivizing a legal purchase. If you're a fan of Rare games, you'll want to buy Rare Replay not for the games themselves, but the digital museum in which Rare has them stored. But before we go any further, let's talk about what piracy looks like in 2015: Piracy, generally speaking, requires an emulator and a ROM. A software emulator recreates the system requirements needed to run a video game, essentially turning your PC into, say, a Super Nintendo or Sega Genesis. A ROM is the game file, ripped from a disc or cartridge, that plays inside of the emulator. The most popular emulators, developed by fans, tinkerers, and coders, have been slowly adding features to old games. Some emulators, for example, may improve a game's visuals, while others allow players to rewind their progress. Today, emulators often provide a superior experience to the official and legal barebones re-releases of the classics, like the catalog of Nintendo's Virtual Console.   To compete with piracy, a developer will always retain one advantage over emulation: history. A developer has a game's original code, experience developing the game and any prequels or sequels, and the juicy scoop on all the ups-and-downs from behind the scenes. Rare Replay excels because it capitalized on its history, providing stability, quality, and perhaps best of all, context. Thirty games spanning 30 years are curated in a virtual showroom, each game accompanied with its own display: a high-resolution poster, cute custom animations,  in-game achievements, a brief description, and a support page. Games that predate the Nintendo 64 have rewind functionality, and all of the classics run better than I remember on the original hardware. (Some people have reported issues with the backwards compatibility functionality of Xbox 360 games in the collection.) Playing through the games unlocks video interviews with Rare designers, past and present, shining a light on life at the studio. A mini-game collection called Snapshots breaks out moments from various games in the collection, giving players a quick taste of the classics without committing to completing each to see the best parts. There are games on this collection I had never played, and others I never liked, but I appreciate everything in the collection more within the context of this package. I don't just see the games as stand-alone objects; they're parts of a legacy shared by a crew of humans doing their damnedest to explore the medium's uncharted waters. To counter piracy, publishers must go on the offensive What developers and publishers can provide is a controlled experience. I wouldn't have that guided experience downloading every Rare game in a unmarked folder from who knows where. Nor would everything run as smoothly. While some PC experts will know how to operate emulators with no problems or headaches or errors, software emulation for the average person is nowhere near as approachable or reliable as seamlessly switching from one game to the next. But piracy isn't even the Big Bad for game publishers. Music and video streaming has carved into the sales of albums, films, and television shows. Video game streaming will become, at the very least, a respected secondary option for game lovers. At that time, publishers will be even more incentivized to package their classic games in ways that interest consumers who can just as well stream thousands of games under a single monthly fee. Some smart developers are already trying to tackle this problem; we'll see Digital Eclipses' Mega Man Legacy, which the developer hopes will bring a Criterion-like model to video games, later this year. Microsoft in particular seems to be more aware than most about the value of context, not just with Rare Replay but also The Master Chief collection. But with few similar collections announced, it's tough to say if this is the moment the guardians of video game classics catch on. Let's not forget that in 2007, Valve released many of its most beloved games together in The Orange Box, and despite selling millions of copies. the strategy was only replicated by the king of re-releases: Sega. Just chew on that, video game publishers; you've been bested by this guy.

As for what we'll see of Crackdown, we again have Spencer's tweets: @TSobski Final Gamescom content review was today and things are becoming final. Lot's of nostalgia for me with the Crackdown gameplay. (If you're not following Spencer's Twitter replies, you're clearly missing out.)

This allows DJs to quickly and painlessly isolate different elements within a song (such as the drums, for example) for mixing purposes. Today, Stems officially launches to the public, with music retailers including Beatport and Traxsource already offering songs available to download in the new format. Beatport even allows shoppers to try out Stems in their online player, usually splitting up tracks into drums, bass, synths, and vocals.  Stems can be played like normal audio files As the video above shows, Stems makes it easier for DJs to mix tracks by picking out certain elements within a song and adding, for example, filters or tempo changes. Previously, if DJs wanted to isolate parts of a track in this way they'd either have to have access to original recording files or use software to haphazardly filter out certain frequencies. The format is also backward compatible (meaning that Stems tracks can be played simply as MP4s), but high prices and large file sizes mean that this tech is really only for the DJ crowd — whether they're professionals, or just playing to their bedrooms.

It was announced during Xbox's Gamescom press conference that the cross-medium, time-warping third-person shooter will be available for Xbox One on April 5th, 2016. Xbox chief Phil Spencer hinted at the date's reveal on Twitter Saturday afternoon when he told a curious fan more information was forthcoming. Spencer shared a long clip with narration, gameplay, and some notable actors, including Shawn Ashmore (X-Men), Aidan Gillen (Game of Thrones), Dominic Monaghan (Lord of the Rings), and Lance Reddick (The Wire). Ashmore also appeared on stage to help introduce the game. Gamers have known about Quantum Break as long as they've known about the Xbox One itself. The game was announced alongside the console back in May 2013, where it was described as a ""revolutionary entertainment experience."" With titles like Max Payne and Alan Wake in its back pocket, Remedy is a studio defined by cinematic vision — but Quantum Break was supposed to take that commitment to another level. The game's complicated core concept is still unparalleled The game's initial promise was remarkable for its ambition. When it was first detailed in 2013, Quantum Break was said to focus on two playable characters, both of whom had been granted the ability to manipulate time by a failed university experiment. It was more than just a game, too: the playable component was coupled to a TV show focused on the inner workings of Monarch Solutions, the corporation run by the main antagonist. Watching the show would give you information and hints that helped you move forward; your decisions within the game would influence the TV show's plot and progression. It was a complicated, symbiotic relationship, one that still doesn't have any parallels in gaming over two years after Quantum Break's announcement.   You can probably thank the game's wild reach for its severe case of release date slippage. Just over a year after it was first announced, Quantum Break was pushed onto the Xbox One's 2015 slate; just under a year later, Remedy announced that it had been moved to 2016. In fact, we tempered our enthusiasm for the game at last year's Gamescom by commenting that ""we still don't know exactly when you'll be able to play it for yourself.""

This meant I had to sling a bag of lenses on my shoulder, and at the end of a day I’d come home with a card full of RAW files and have to slog through a few hours of editing.   When I bought a Fujifilm X100S, a powerful compact with a DSLR-sized sensor inside, it became the only camera I wanted to carry around. Then I got an iPhone 6, which had a camera that was finally good enough to make me want to leave those other cameras at home. I started modifying it with various lens attachments, and editing and sharing on the fly in apps like VSCO Cam and Darkroom. Now, my usual photo workflow includes a little bit of everything. I’ll shoot with my phone when it’s convenient — but my favorite way to take, edit, and post pictures is to use a camera with Wi-Fi or an EyeFi card, sending photos over to my phone for editing and sharing. But this process is often slow and unruly, and I’ve been looking for something better. If I can scratch together $599, I think I’ve found it. DxO, a company best known for developing a rating system for image sensors, made a camera to solve just this problem. It’s called the DxO One, and it plugs right into any Apple device with a Lightning port. It’s the company’s first attempt at hardware, and I hope it’s not the last, because it’s rather exceptional.   The One is a rounded-off rectangle that measures about 1 inch wide by just under 3 inches tall, and it weighs less than an average smartphone. There’s a tiny OLED touchscreen on the back (for switching between shooting photos and videos), along with a trap door for charging and the microSD card. On the front there’s a sliding lens cover that, when pulled down, turns the camera on. On top of the camera is the two-stage shutter button. It’s springy, but it gets the job done. And on the left side of the DxO One is a swiveling Lightning connector that flips out when you pull the lens cover down all the way to the bottom of the camera.   Using the Lightning port is a big part of the DxO One’s appeal because it saves you all the steps of transferring images from your camera to your device. To start, the DxO One app will automatically open as soon as you plug in the camera. (You do have to be on the home screen, though.) As you’re shooting, the camera gives you a live, high-definition feed of what it’s seeing, and will serve up the pictures you take in real time, just like any other digital camera. The ability to work through the Lightning port makes the One a very convenient camera to use, but the physical connection feels a little loose. It’s fine when you have both hands on, say, your phone and the camera, but shooting with the One by just gripping the camera is a dangerous act. On my first day with the camera I was being a little too confident with it, and when I turned my phone the camera slipped right out and rattled around on the floor. (The good news is the DxO One can, apparently, withstand at least one drop of about 5 feet.) The DxO One is a photographic powerhouse, considering its size. Inside the housing is an f1.8 lens that is sharp and great for low light photography, and it has a minimum focusing distance of just 20 centimeters. It has a battery that will last you more than 200 shots, or a few hours of heavy use. But what really makes the DxO One unique is it uses a 1-inch sensor. The camera is hardly bigger than a GoPro, and yet it has the same size sensor as what’s found in the Sony RX100, or in Nikon’s J1 and V1 cameras, or about two and a half times the size of the sensor in an iPhone 6. The DxO One is capable of shooting 20.2 megapixel DNG raw and JPEG images, as well as 1080p video. (It can even shoot slow motion at 120 frames per second, although it’s limited to 720p.) Since Apple devices can’t display DNG or RAW format images, the camera will flash a JPEG preview on your device so that you can review what you shot. These can take a second or two to render, however, which slows down the whole experience and could cause you to miss moments — especially if you’re trying to capture something that’s moving fast. (DxO says a burst mode of about 8 frames per second is coming in a software update.) And whichever format you shoot in, the camera defaults to saving a JPEG on your phone every time you take a picture, but you can — and probably should — change this. Even with those limitations in mind, shooting with the DxO One was some of the most fun I’ve had taking pictures in recent memory. A lot of that comes from being able to just throw the camera in my pocket — any pocket, really. (This thing even fits comfortably in a shirt pocket.) Not only was it always on me, I didn’t hesitate to bring it with me on a long bike ride, when I normally would have thought twice about slinging a camera around my neck. The fun also comes from the ways you can shoot. Much like cameras with tilting LCD touchscreens, you don’t have to exclusively use the One at eye level. Because the lightning connector can pivot about 60 degrees in either direction, you can hold your device and the DxO One as low as your belt or as high as your arms will reach and still be able to line up a shot. This made it particularly great for street photography. My favorite thing to do with the DxO One was to carry it at the hip and shoot as I walked through the streets of New York City. You can even use the camera when it’s not plugged into a device, if you want to be really inconspicuous with your shooting. The camera’s 32mm equivalent focal length is wide enough that it’s hard to miss your target, even if you’re shooting blind, but isn’t so wide that it’s hard to make out what you were targeting. Each day I was able to take (great) photos walking to, from, and even on the subway that I never would have bothered to attempt with most other cameras. Where the DxO really shines is when you’re shooting a subject close up, particularly in low light. The f1.8 lens does such a good job separating subjects from the background that photos at this aperture really pop. But if there’s one issue I have with the image quality it’s that the camera’s software removes too much noise during the conversion to JPEG. I’m fine with this in extreme low light situations — a handful of shots I took at a bar at ISO 10,000 were far better than anything I could have gotten on my phone — but when it happens at lower ISO speeds, the effect is unpleasant and makes otherwise sharp images look a little bit muddy. (The camera also offers a mode called ""SuperRAW,"" which is a proprietary format that uses four separate raw images to reduce noise in low light.) On the left, a raw DNG file shot at ISO 10,000. On the right, the compressed JPEG that the DxO One processed and sent to my phone. While the hardware is great, the DxO One would be pretty useless without decent software. But the app that DxO has made is excellent, and would be one of the best-designed photo apps on iOS even without the camera accompanying it. Settings such as ISO, aperture, shutter speed, and exposure bias are all quickly accessible on the left side of the screen, while small bubbles on the right give you access to the different PSAM modes and things like flash control. It's fast and simple, and there's more on the way here as well — DxO says features like manual focus will be added down the road. From the app, to the image quality, to the ease of use, I was really floored by how much fun I had with the DxO One. But in the end, it’s probably not going to disrupt how I take most of my photos, and it’s hard to see how it could disrupt anyone else’s. It’s a device that’s really made for photo enthusiasts like myself, but at $599, even most enthusiasts will have to think twice about making a purchase. In fact, that amount of money would get me a long way toward upgrading my X100S to something with faster, built-in Wi-Fi, a bigger sensor than the DxO One, and maybe even some lenses to play with. If you’ve been trying to find the right balance between extreme portability and great image quality, this might be the perfect camera for you. But mirrorless cameras keep getting smaller, and it won’t be long before phone cameras catch up. Hopefully by then, we’ll have an even better, cheaper DxO Two.",0.640011241269889,0.35998875873011105,0.1653687230438822,1586,4.3669609079445149,691,5.6570188133140373,0,13,"Photography, Tech, Review"

Yet weirdly, I’ve never felt happier or more satisfied. See, I’m a home owner at the tail end of a major renovation and I just spent the last week covered in dust, paint, and what looks like blood.   Don’t get me wrong, I’m not doing all the heavy lifting — I paid men who wear plaid and cargo pants unironically for that. I’m just in for the finishing touches. The fun stuff like furniture assembly, wiring up the lamps for wireless control, integrating the ceiling speakers into my Sonos network, and setting up the family NAS on the new cat6 ethernet. Seeing all my plans come to fruition a few years after the project began is hugely rewarding on its own. But the fact that I’m complicit in its execution reminds me just how cathartic Do-It-Yourself can be. Study after study has shown the psychological boost provided by handiwork, often citing the benefits for the elderly (knitters are especially happy people, it seems). But research also demonstrates the benefits of building something off the instructions on a Lego box. A 2011 study titled ""The IKEA effect: When labor leads to love"" is exactly what you think it is and helps explain why my house — after a week of intense labor — is starting to feel like a home. As enticing as a night in front of the TV sounds right about now, I know that after binging on Netflix I’ll just feel lethargic and miserable like that sucker punch you get after downing a super-sized Big Mac combo. Yeah, I’m tired, but it’s a good tired knowing that I’m advancing towards a goal. To be or not to be isn’t the question you should be asking. The correct question is to do or not to do? And for me, the answer is simple: do, don’t just be.   The so-called ""heart in a box"" uses tubing and oxygen to pump blood and electrolytes into hearts from recently deceased patients, allowing the organs to continue functioning within a chamber. The system, developed by Massachusetts-based Transmedics, has been successfully deployed in at least 15 heart transplants in the UK and Australia, and is awaiting regulatory approval in the US. Now, thanks to a mod for the PC version of Grand Theft Auto 5, you can fly another Imperial capital ship over the game's Los Angeles analog, Los Santos. The mod changes GTA 5's blimp, re-skinning it to appear as a classic Imperial Star Destroyer — the same ship that chases Princess Leia's Tantive IV in the opening shot of Star Wars: A New Hope. The company is still withholding crucial information like pricing and release date — but those probably aren't too far off. We're not even yet positive which phones it works with; if history is any indication, it'll be limited to Samsung's more recent devices. In today's press release, Samsung has revealed that its latest Tizen-powered watch will come in two models: the regular Gear S2 and a Gear S2 classic, which is aimed at consumers who ""prefer more timeless watch design."" You may have been too focused on Kanye West's presidential run to notice last night, but Twitter is experimenting with Snapchat-style, location-based photo and video filters around big events. TechCrunch spotted a series of tweets from VMA nominees including Taylor Swift, Pharrell Williams, and Big Sean featuring VMA-related stickers. Variety says that Apple's plans are in the early stages, but that the company has increased its interest in producing its own TV shows or movies in recent months. The company reportedly made an offer to ex-Top Gear hosts Jeremy Clarkson, James May and Richard Hammond in July, before the trio were eventually snapped up by Amazon. Apple certainly has the coffers to be able to afford such deals, but the company may not have been ready to pull the trigger at the time, having reportedly pushed the launch of its rumored internet TV service back to 2016 at the earliest.

No matter what smartphone you have, all of them work within some concrete limitations. The battery can only last so long, the screen can only be so big, and the internal storage can only hold so much data. Some phones let you use microSD cards to alleviate that last problem, but many don't and it's not a ideal solution for many. Nextbit, the company formed by former members of Google's Android team, thinks the cloud is the answer to many of these questions, and its first device, the Robin, promises to never run out of storage. The Robin doesn't really have an endless amount of storage, but rather leverages cloud storage systems to offload pictures, video, files, and even apps when its 32GB of local storage runs out. Nextbit's software, which runs on top of Android, is designed to learn your habits and automatically offload photos and apps that haven't been used in a long time to the cloud to free up storage as necessary. A simple tap on one of the offloaded apps, which appear as greyed out icons, and it's downloaded from the cloud with all data and settings intact. Photos can be restored to the phone at full resolution or a screen-optimized size, which allows for more to be stored locally at any given time. Nextbit says the full resolution files are always backed up to the cloud.  Backing up photos and video to the cloud is something that a lot of apps are already tackling, such as Google Photos or Microsoft OneDrive. Nextbit insists its solution is superior, however, as it seamlessly backs things up whenever ideal conditions are met (Wi-Fi connection, phone is plugged in) and users don't have to remember to open an app to make sure their photos are backed up. The Robin will also free up space on demand, instead of requiring the user to manually delete things when their phone refuses to take any more pictures. Nextbit also says you'll be able to transfer your data and backups to other devices that run its software, but it's not clear exactly how it will restore everything to a new device. This constant cycling of the data on the phone is what Nextbit points to as its big differentiator in the very crowded world of smartphones. The company is giving each buyer of the Robin 100GB of cloud storage for free, though in an interview, CEO Tom Moss tells me that number is not fixed and can be adjusted if Nextbit sees that users need more cloud storage capacity. Interestingly enough, Nextbit isn't planning on charging any subscription fees for the cloud storage and Moss insists that its business model relies on profits from hardware sales. The Robin comes with 100GB of cloud storage for free Speaking of hardware, the Robin is a uniquely designed mid-range Android phone. Nextbit tapped former HTC designer Scott Croyle as its head of design in 2014, and set out to make a phone that stands out among the sea of similar looking phones. The result is a device that's starkly rectangular, but with circular details throughout. The Robin's all-plastic chassis houses a 5.2-inch, 1080p display, Qualcomm Snapdragon 808 processor, 3GB of RAM, a 2,680mAh battery, and 13-megapixel camera. Unique additions include a USB Type-C charging port and fingerprint scanner embedded into the side-mounted power button. The Robin is completely carrier and bootloader unlocked and is compatible with AT&T and T-Mobile LTE.  Nextbit is selling the Robin through a Kickstarter campaign, which launches today and lasts for 30 days. Early backers will be able to nab the phone for $299, while standard backers will be able to get it for $349. It's not expected to ship until January and will have a retail price of $399 when it does. The Robin's specs are acceptable for a mid-range phone today, but it's hard to say how they will stand up to whatever's available come January. Nextbit isn't the only company playing in this lower cost bracket, and many of its competitors already have comparably-specced devices available for purchase. But Moss says that Nextbit's small size and the experience of its founders will help it navigate the difficult waters of producing and selling a smartphone in 2015 and 2016. Nextbit has more plans for cloud processing in the future Nextbit's cloud processing ambitions aren't limited to storage, either, as Moss notes that there are number of cloud-based applications that could ease the pain points people have with smartphones. For now, though, endless storage is the main draw. Whether or not that plus the Robin's striking design is enough to make Nextbit a success remains to be seen, but it will be interesting to see how the company progresses over the next few months leading up to the release of the phone.",0.38486446930925516,0.6151355306907449,0.41335147421134716,815,4.8110429447852763,421,5.9643705463182899,1,2,"Google, Mobile, Tech"

The additional guidelines, spotted by 9to5Mac, come two weeks after  Apple opened up the platform to developers and medical researchers around the world. What prompted the change is unclear Apple announced ResearchKit in early March to great fanfare. At the time, only a handful of institutions had been given access to the platform. Almost immediately questions about the ethics of running clinical trials exclusively through mobile phones were raised. When The Verge reported on the story in March, it was unclear whether IRB approval would become mandatory for apps that made it to the Apple apps store. The five apps that were released through the app store on the day of the announcement had all been approved by an independent ethics review board, but the app store guidelines lacked specific wording about the need for Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval for these apps. A few days later, Apple released new developer guidelines for ResearchKit-made apps. They demanded that all research apps ""obtain consent from participants or, in the case of minors, their parent or guardian."" As noted in The Verge's ResearchKit ethics story, the first set of apps made through ResearchKit made it very easy for minors to lie about their age in order to gain access to clinical trials aimed at people over 18. ""Proof of such approval must be provided upon request."" Now, two weeks after making ResearchKit available to all developers, Apple has added another set of guidelines that make IRB approval mandatory. ""Apps conducting health-related human subject research must secure approval from an independent ethics review board,"" the new guidelines read. ""Proof of such approval must be provided upon request."" It's unclear what might have prompted the addition. The Verge has reached out to Apple for comment on this issue. Overall, the change is a welcome step. IRBs are designed to approve, monitor, and review scientific trials involving humans. This process often involves a risk-benefit analysis that's aimed at determining whether the research should be conducted at all. Still, some questions remain about how scientists will use ResearchKit moving forward. As researchers become comfortable with the idea of running a trial exclusively through an app, studies might become riskier. If that happens, developers will likely have to make some changes — changes that may include coming up with more secure ways of keeping minors from participating in these trials, for instance. In the meantime, however, mandatory IRB approval should help protect users from taking part in dubious trials. Correction: An earlier version of this article defined IRB as an ""Independent Review Board."" That is incorrect. IRB stands for ""Institutional Review Board."" We regret the error.

It has been used to create everything from hearing aids to dental implants. But so far, applying this technology to children who are still growing has been a challenge. That might soon change, however, as researchers were able to cure three babies of a life-threatening breathing condition thanks to a 3D-printed splint installed on their airways. And, remarkably, the device was able to grow with them — a tremendous step forward for those who always imagined that 3D printing would save lives. The first child to receive this implant three years ago appears to be cured ""This is the first 3D-printed implant specifically designed to change shape over time to allow for a child's growth before finally resorbing as the disease is cured,"" said Glenn Green, a pediatrician at the University of Michigan and a co-author of the study published today in Science Translational Medicine, at a press conference. Moreover, he said, the first child to receive this implant three years ago appears to be cured. All three babies involved in this study suffered from a life-threatening version of tracheal bronchomalacia — a rare disease that causes excessive airway collapse during breathing. The condition affects about one in 2,000 children around the world. Typically, children outgrow the condition by the age of three, but in severe cases, children die before their airways become strong enough. This was the situation faced by the three babies in this study. All had been in intensive care units for months and had episodes that required repeated resuscitations. In fact, the only reason these babies were allowed to participate in this study is because they were in such bad shape — the airway splint was considered a therapy of last resort. ""They would have died within days to weeks."" ""One child was unable to have any food in his stomach due to his fragility,"" Green told The Verge in an email. Without the surgery, ""they would have died within days to weeks."" In the study, the researchers designed splints for each of these children out of a porous, harmless material called polycaprolactone, which degrades over time. The splints are designed to be sutured to the outside of the airway, which helps hold the airway open.   Morrison et al. Science Translation Medicine (2015) To create the splints, the researchers first created computerized 3D models of their tracheas from C.T. images. Then, they put these measurements into a custom computer program capable of automatically generating a splint design tailored to each patient’s anatomy. ""We can then take the design from that program and digitally fit it back onto the patient's airway model as really a first quality measure of how the splint will work and fit to the patient's airway,"" explains Scott Hollister, a biomedical engineer at the University of Michigan and a co-author of the study. When it came time to print the implants, the researchers used ""laser sintering"" — a process by which a machine melts a powder on a layer-by-layer basis to make a 3D structure. Printing each implant took between one and three days, the researchers say. Once that was done, the scientists ran a battery of tests on the devices to ensure that it had the right stiffness.  And because the cost of the splints was so low — the material costs about $10 per splint — the researchers were able to practice installing them multiple times on 3D models of the children’s tracheas and bronchi before performing the surgeries on the infants.   Morrison et al. Science Translation Medicine (2015) Because the splints form of a semi-circle, the researchers predicted that they would be able to expand as the children developed. The material used to make the splints would also help with that because it starts out stiff and becomes more flexible over time. ""Long-term, our greatest concern was whether the airway splint would open up as we designed it to,"" says Robert Morrison, a surgeon at the University of Michigan and a third co-author of the study. ""If it did not, the child's airway could be prevented from growing normally and there could be narrowing of the airway, which would be as serious of an issue as their original condition."" ""Our greatest concern was whether the airway splint would open up as we designed it to."" All three surgeries were a success. Repeated CAT scans of the children months after the surgery revealed that the airways were growing properly.  Today, the three toddlers have airways that have remained open — including the child who received the implant first, three years ago.  Moreover, the splints have successfully degraded over time. ""This airway splint cured the children of an imminently lethal disease and now is dissolving,"" Green told The Verge. As the splints break down, the children will excrete them from their bodies; each child should be splint-free three to four years after surgery. Now that this study is complete, the researchers plan to conduct a trial involving children who suffer from a slightly less severe form of tracheal bronchomalacia. The researchers are also actively looking for other opportunities to use this technology. ""The possibilities are really limitless,"" Morrison said. ""When we talk about 3D printing and medicine, we talk about how you really need to switch how you even think about approaching these conditions."" Green agrees. ""This is the first of many devices of its kind."" Correction: A previous version of this article referred to the 3D printing technique as ""laser centering."" That's incorrect. The technique is called ""laser sintering."" We regret the error. ",0.5284911659216182,0.47150883407838184,0.8448253274421488,939,5.019169329073482,437,6.2402745995423343,0,4,"Science, Report"

Add this to the list of ""things you can buy online"": a stranger’s breast milk. Online milk exchanges — unregulated sites where breast milk is bought, sold, and donated — have taken off in recent years, with multiple websites facilitating transactions between moms with milk to spare and those in need. Despite the long list of milk-seeking ads by adult men — some simply pervy, others interested in the purported health powers of breast milk — researchers say the bulk of the market is moms unable to breastfeed or produce enough milk. Milk from untested sources, like the ones on online markets, comes with risksThe long list of the benefits of breast milk — ranging from protection against childhood infections, to a lower risk of diabetes and obesity, to higher IQ and income as an adult — have made lactation a high-stakes game for new moms. But milk from untested donor sources, like the ones on online markets, comes with risks. Viruses, including HIV and cytomegalovirus (CMV), can be transmitted, and without pasteurization, there is also the potential for harmful levels of bacteria like Staphylococcus or even Salmonella. In 2013 a research group led by Dr. Sarah Keim of the Nationwide Children’s Hospital found that about three-quarters of samples bought online would have failed the standards for bacteria levels at a donor milk bank, and a follow-up study released this month, also led by Keim, showed that 10 percent of online samples were diluted with cow’s milk or formula — a potentially serious problem for newborns with a dairy allergy. But traffic to online markets has continued to rise as more moms look to the internet for help. Across the US, online transactions have more than doubled in the past three years, from around 22,000 in 2012 to about 55,000 today, according to Jesse Kwiek, Associate Professor of Microbiology at the University of Ohio and a co-author of the recent Keim study. Support for breastfeeding mothers hasn't kept paceCreators of sites like OnlyTheBreast.com frame the online exchanges as an alternative to pricey donor milk banks, which screen and pasteurize milk. That site had about 27,000 members last year and is adding about 800 more each month. While men are helping to drive this increase, it could also be a symptom of a bigger issue: as the emphasis on the importance of breastfeeding has risen, support for breastfeeding mothers hasn’t necessarily kept pace.           Danielle Pitman, a 24-year-old single mother in Pennsylvania, signed up for Only The Breast after noticing that her four-month-old’s eczema cleared up after drinking breast milk, which was donated by one of her friends. Pitman, a full-time student who also works as a waitress, said that after breastfeeding became unbearably painful and pumping several times a day too time-consuming for her busy schedule, she switched to formula with her doctor’s support. She cried for a week over the decision to switch to formula and lied to friends about having a lactation issue to stem what she said was harsh judgement over ""not trying hard enough."" But her son quickly developed a rash after the switch, and at about $50 for a two-and-a-half day supply, the doctor-recommended formula was difficult to afford. Eventually, through Only The Breast, she found a mom a short drive away offering her extra supply for free. ""I thought about the risks a lot.""""I thought about the risks a lot,"" she said of the online-sourced donation, but eventually decided to use the milk after meeting the family. Still, she says the process made her so anxious that she wouldn’t do it again and is consulting with her doctor about other options. ""I think I just got lucky,"" she said. She hadn’t known about non-profit donor milk banks, but wouldn’t have been able to afford the $3.75 to $5 per ounce cost of donor milk anyway, Pitman said. Only 15 donor milk banks, all run by the Human Milk Banking Association of America (HMBANA), serve the entire country with screened and pasteurized breast milk. Unlike the milk traded online, donor banks must meet FDA regulations. The organization distributed about 3.3 million ounces of milk last year, mainly to infants in neo-natal intensive care units, but it’s always short on supply, says Pauline Sakamoto, president of HMBANA. The banks are unable to meet the demands of other, non-life-threatening cases, like moms who have undergone mastectomies, have other issues that prevent breastfeeding, or simply need a supplement to what they can produce. ""a lost supply.""Cost is another issue. Donor milk entails a service fee of up to $5 per ounce — which is rarely covered by insurance, according to Sakamoto. The Affordable Care Act (ACA), passed in 2010, has a mandate for breastfeeding support, including breast pumps and lactation consultants and other services deemed ""medically appropriate,"" but the law is vague on exactly what is covered.          Milk bottles (RustyClark)  For Sakamoto, women selling their excess milk on online exchanges represent ""a lost supply"" for hospitalized babies in need. But for women like Ashleigh Baruch, a mother of three who sells her excess milk on Only The Breast, casual sharing sites are a necessary, but imperfect, alternative to milk banks. Compared to formula or expensive donor milk, she calls the online exchanges and the risks that come with them ""the lesser of two evils."" ""No one is truly honest about how hard it is.""""We all know that breastfeeding is the best, but there is a lot of ignorance for men and first-time mothers,"" said Baruch, who often spends up to eight hours a day either breastfeeding her baby or pumping. ""No one is truly honest about how hard it is."" Like other women I spoke to, she says there are a lot of scam artists trolling the sites, and the majority of requests she got were from men for ""the weird stuff."" She’s made about $3,000 to $4,000 over the last six months selling excess milk at a premium of $6 per ounce for male buyers, or $2 an ounce for moms. Buyer beware For now, the onus of safety checks — through donor blood or milk tests and pasteurization — falls on online buyers. Only The Breast offers safe buying tips and encourages milk pasteurization, but the site, like others of its kind, operate under the ""use at your own risk"" model. When The Verge contacted the site for comment on this article, site administrators pointed to their published advice on online buying and said, “The vast majority of OTB members are  honest, abiding by OTB terms and are simply looking to provide safe milk  for babies in need.”  Only The Breast does not take responsibility for any harm stemming from milk exchanged through the site, according to its terms of use, and because all online exchanges are unregulated, site owners are not obligated to report incidents or bad actors to authorities. In 2010 the FDA warned against purchasing milk online, but stopped short of officially regulating milk exchanged on the sites. According to Sakamoto, if they had more donors and more cooperation from insurers, they would be able to serve the market that might instead go online: women with breastfeeding issues, or healthy babies with special needs; even men seeking the medical benefits of breast milk. ""Our country, our culture needs to support breastfeeding moms,"" said Sakamoto. ""However we can do that.""",0.4930963297051669,0.5069036702948331,0.824196961020021,1253,4.9050279329608939,606,6.3052805280528057,0,4,"Culture, Science, Report"

Deep in the bowels of a secluded facility outside the central Japanese city of Nagoya, a team of dedicated researchers has been working on a monster. It’s a primal, animalistic robot that uses advanced technology to power its intelligent vision, flexible movement, and giant arms strong enough to lift a human right off the ground. It could have profound implications for the relationship between man and machine. But perhaps most importantly, it is very cute. Meet Robear. It’s a high-tech teddy with a mission: helping make elderly care much easier in the future. Robear is the brainchild of Toshiharu Mukai (above left), an affable scientist who has been leading his Robot Sensor Systems Research Team at the Riken-SRK Collaboration Center for Human-Interactive Robot Research since 2007. It’s actually Mukai’s third robot bear, following 2009’s RIBA and 2011’s RIBA-II. Why the ursine fixation? ""Bears are powerful and also cute,"" Mukai tells me. ""And our product is white so it will be associated with cleanness."" Cute robots are a definite trend. Japanese carrier SoftBank is selling its congenial, dubiously useful Pepper this year, in perhaps the biggest mainstream splash yet made by a humanoid. This month, leading national bank Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ installed Aldebaran’s Nao robot as an assistant in its flagship branch. And Mukai believes that appearance is more than just skin-deep when it comes to robots. ""[It’s important that they’re] cute or friendly,"" he says. ""Patients, especially old people, don’t like mechanical appearance. Patients need to feel that robots are their friends."" That’s especially true with Robear, because it’s a robot that gets very paws-on. Robear is designed to perform tasks such as helping elderly patients stand up, or lifting them from a bed into a wheelchair. The latter task can be severely strenuous for care workers, who do it an average of 40 times a day, according to Mukai. It’s no secret that Japan’s aging population is one of the biggest problems facing the country, and researchers are hoping to find solutions in technology. It’s important for Robear to make a good first impression. And, as I walked into the room where the research team keeps Robear, it couldn’t have been more polite. I was greeted with a Japanese-style bow, then a wave when Robear raised its head. These are all pre-programmed routines, of course, but they’re disarmingly engaging for an anthropomorphic, computerized hunk of metal and soft plastic. That said, Mukai admits that the design may not have universal appeal around the world — Robear is pretty clearly a Japanese robot. Lifting patients up sounds simple, but it requires a defter touch than a forklift truck. Robear improves on its RIBA predecessors by incorporating more precise actuators that allow for softer, more precise movement. There are also torque sensors and smart rubber capacitive sensors to further refine the robot’s gentle touch. At 140 kilograms, Robear is about 40 percent lighter than RIBA-II and has a small base with retractable legs to prioritize either stability or mobility. The actuators are what makes Robear work, but they’re also by far its most expensive component, and as such the primary barrier between the bear and the real world. Mukai estimates the cost of the current Robear prototype at ¥20-30 million (between $168,000 and $252,000), but hopes the price will come down to reasonable levels within the next 20 to 30 years. Time will be of the essence for any technology in this sector — a Japanese government research institute predicts that the country’s 127-million-strong population will decrease to around 116.62 million by 2030, 99.13 million in 2048, and 86.74 million by 2060, assuming medium birth and death rate projections. The need for elderly care will grow as the population shrinks. Robear is expensive today, but other aspects of its design make use of readily available, affordable consumer electronics; there’s a slot at the back for a Google Nexus 7 tablet to give touchscreen control, and the bear’s head includes a Microsoft Kinect depth-sensing camera to detect bodies in front of it. That feature isn’t quite ready yet — one issue is that the sensor doesn’t work through the bear’s ""mouth,"" and leaving it exposed somewhat undermines its cute appeal. Cost isn’t the only thing holding Robear back from becoming hospital ready. ""This robot is too complicated, so maintenance and operations are difficult,"" says Mukai. ""For researchers it’s okay, but for care workers this is too complicated."" But the team has done its best to make Robear as intuitive to use as possible. Basic movements and commands are accessible on the tablet’s touchscreen, and capacitive sensors on the arms allow for operators to make adjustments on the fly to make sure the body is fully supported. In the demonstrations I saw, Robear lifted up a researcher from both a bed and a wheelchair in what seemed to be a very natural manner. When will Robear, or robots like it, be ready for real-word deployment? Mukai isn’t sure. ""Most robotic researchers think that robots will be common in the future,"" he says. ""But we can’t say when. In a hundred years, I’m sure robots will be popular but in 10 years? I’m not sure. Demonstrations are attractive, but the practical benefit is still not so high. At some point we’ll need a breakthrough, but we don’t know when it will come. I hope it’ll be in the next 10 years but I can’t assure it."" And Mukai believes that practical application is the most important thing for truly meaningful mainstream robot adoption, with companies like SoftBank not yet making a strong enough case. ""Communication robots have already been sold in Japan for about 10 years,"" he says. ""At first we’ll be happy with the robot, but several days later we’ll get bored. Maybe Pepper is better than previous ones, but we’re not sure that communication robots are what people really want."" Robear has a lot of hurdles to jump before it’s able to help regular people. But even at this early stage, it feels like a viable approach long term. Technology always comes down in price and accessibility, and the same will no doubt prove true for Robear. It’s a robot conceived with focus; while it’s only meant to carry out a few tasks, it’s designed to do them with minimal friction and maximal efficiency.

They also make up the coldest and driest environments on the planet. Yet, despite these extreme conditions, the valleys' surface is home to a large diversity of microbial life. Now, new evidence suggests that a vast network of salty liquid water exists 1,000 feet below the surface — a finding that lends support to the idea that microbial life may exist beneath Antarctica's surface as well. The finding isn't just exciting for Earth ecologists, however; planetary scientists are intrigued as well. Indeed, finding salty liquid water below Antarctica provides strong support for the idea that Mars, an environment that resembles Antarctic summers, may have similar aquifers beneath its surface — aquifers that could support microscopic life. ""We didn't know to what extent life could exist beneath the glaciers.""  ""[Before this study], we didn't know to what extent life could exist beneath the glaciers, beneath hundreds of meters of ice, beneath ice covered lakes and deep into the soil,"" says Ross Virginia, an ecosystem environmentalist at Dartmouth College and a co-author of the study, published in Nature Communications today. This study opens up ""possibilities for better understanding the combinations of factors that might be found on other planets and bodies outside of the Earth"" — including Mars. Approximately 4.5 billion years ago, 20 percent of the Martian surface was likely covered in water. Today, Mars may still be home to small amounts of salty liquid water, which would exist on the planet's soil at night before evaporating during the daytime. Taken together, these findings are pretty exciting for those who hope to discover life on Mars — water, after all, is a requirement for life. Unfortunately, researchers have also pointed out that the Martian surface is far too cold for the survival of any known forms of life. That's why some scientists have started to wonder about what may lie beneath the Martian surface. If the extreme environment conditions found in Antarctica's subsurface contains all the elements necessary for life, it's possible that the Martian subsurface might as well.   J. Mikucki  In the study, researchers flew a helicopter more than 114 square miles over Taylor Valley — the southernmost of the three dry valleys. Below the helicopter, researchers suspended a large antenna. The technology, called SkyTem, acted as an airborne electromagnetic sensor that generated an electromagnetic field capable of penetrating through ice or into the soil in the dry valley. As the antenna surveyed the valley, the electromagnetic field reflected back information that was altered from the original signal depending on whether it encountered a brine or frozen soil or ice, Virginia explains. ""So basically we're inferring the distribution of those types of materials based on what is reflected back to these helicopters flying over the surface of Antarctica."" ""probably much more extensive subsurface environments in Antarctica where life might exist."" The results of this study indicate that unfrozen brines — salty and slightly thick water solutions — form an extensive system of interconnected aquifers beneath frozen soils, lakes, and glaciers. The brines may be the result of ancient ocean deposits. They may also be the remnants of an evaporated or frozen ancient lake. ""By flying this technology for the first time in Antarctica, we were able to determine that there is this extensive subsurface environment that isn't frozen that contains water and salt at temperatures at which microbial life is expected to exist,"" Virginia says. And that means that ""there are probably much more extensive subsurface environments in Antarctica where life might exist."" an extensive system of interconnected aquifers beneath frozen soils The idea that life may exist in unfrozen brines below Antarctica didn't pop out of nowhere. Jill Mikucki, a microbiologist at University of Tennessee and a co-author of this study, has spent some time analyzing brines samples in Blood Falls — an area in the Antarctic that exudes red-colored subglacial brines that are pushed to the surface. ""Without drilling, this is our own natural portal for looking at what these brines might be about,"" Virginia says. Thanks to this work, Mikucki found that the brines are about twice as salty as ocean water. ""They also contain densities of microbial cells that are similar to groundwater found in other areas,"" he says. Moreover, the researchers confirmed their findings regarding the composition of the subsurface by comparing their results to those obtained by researchers who were allowed to drill boreholes into the soil in a small area of the Antarctic in the 1970s. ""We took the instrument and flew it over the same zones, and found very similar patterns and results,"" Virginia says. Now that this initial study is complete, Virginia and his team are hoping to return to survey a larger area using more recent technology. This kind of research is important because it provides an opportunity to ask a set of new questions about what the limits to life are, where life exists on Earth, and how widespread these ecosystems might be, Virginia says. ""I think that habitats suitable for life are just about everywhere on this planet, and learning about these environments is important not only for understanding life on Earth but also for understanding life on other planets,"" he says. ""Fundamentally this type of work just tells us more about ourselves."" Besides, ""we need to understand Earth, to understand Mars.""",0.5045922548023539,0.4954077451976461,0.7294594202506617,908,5.251101321585903,422,6.3720379146919433,0,2,"Science, Report"

Confusion reigned initially, with users in different cities and across various ISPs giving conflicting reports about the extent of the ""outage."" By Monday morning, however, it became clear that the Indian government had issued an order late last Friday to all ISPs calling for ""disablement"" of 857 sites. The fact that some could still access the websites was later put down to the timing of the order, as many ISPs didn’t have the necessary staff to implement the ban over the weekend. Viewing porn isn’t illegal in India, so you can imagine that the news of the ban invoked sharp criticism from users and activists alike. A copy of the order leaked soon enough, and a closer inspection of the list of blocked websites revealed that popular humor site 9gag and some torrent sites like KickassTorrents were also caught in the crossfire, further fueling the outrage. The news of the ban invoked sharp criticism from users and activists alike The uproar prompted the government to offer an explanation, with the Telecom and IT minister Ravi Shankar Prasad saying, ""The instant action is basically in obedience to the observation of the Supreme Court where the court asked the department to take action on the list of alleged porn sites provided by the petitioner."" That’s a reference to a petition pending before the highest court in the land, one that seeks to block access to porn sites in India. The country’s chief justice, H.L. Dattu, had refused to issue an interim order banning all porn sites citing right to personal liberty. During the course of the same case, the court had asked the government what action had been taken to block child porn websites, and it seems last week’s order is an overly broad reaction to that. After the backlash, the government first removed the likes of 9gag from the block list and later issued a clarification to the original order, saying the ISPs ""are free not to disable any of the 857 URLs which do not have child pornography."" Understandably, the ISPs want to play no role in this, and want government to decide which URLs should be (or stay) banned. The impracticalities of ISPs investing time and effort in what constitutes child porn aside, businesses in India will always err on the side of caution when it comes to deciding what classifies as ""objectionable"" — this is a country where broadcasters voluntarily censor out the most harmless content because if someone takes offense to something, the penalties can be harsh. In 2014, for example, Comedy Central was asked to go off air for six days after a viewer complained about two shows — Stand Up Club and Popcorn — that aired on the channel in 2012. The government apparently has no will to enforce its own order With that in mind, it’s understandable why the ISPs are saying that until the government explicitly says otherwise, all URLs in that order will stay blocked. The ground reality, though, is that many porn websites part of the original list are now accessible across various ISPs, something no one will officially admit. This also shows that the government apparently has no will to enforce its own order. Simultaneously, the Indian government is now talking about setting up an ombudsman for online content, effectively a top cop for the internet in India. In the past, the government has also talked about the ""evil impact"" of social media, and the need to regulate what’s being said on Twitter and Facebook. For citizens, all this sounds a little bit too familiar to how the internet operates in neighboring China. There’s no denying the fact that child porn should be banned, but banning all porn websites without any directive from a court is both overzealous and  an infringement on the right to personal liberty, as the chief justice has himself said. If the government’s really worried about internet users in India, there are plenty of other legitimate issues that need to be urgently addressed. For instance, India is currently embroiled in a net neutrality debate that closely mirrors the one that has gripped the United States for the past several years. A government-appointed panel recently shared its recommendations on the subject, which include a provision that ""domestic"" VoIP calls — calls made via apps like Skype and WhatsApp where both parties are in India — should be regulated similarly to calls made from a mobile phone. Telcos in India have been complaining about loss of revenue — real or otherwise — resulting from customers preferring these apps over traditional calls, and it seems the regulator has dropped the ball on this subject. There are other issues with the recommendations as well, and one hopes that consumer-friendly policies prevail in the end, as they did in the US. India is currently embroiled in a net neutrality debate Second, India is saddled with a ridiculous, obsolete definition of high-speed internet.  It’s 2015, yet a 512kbps line passes off as ""broadband"" here. Some ISPs have upped the minimum to 2Mbps, but others refuse because there’s no regulatory stick forcing them to follow suit. For all the talk of digital revolution in the country, India has the second-lowest average internet speeds in Asia-Pacific, thanks in part to outdated regulation. And even with reasonable speeds, the FUP (Fair Usage Policy) menace lets ISPs advertise connections at certain speeds, only to throttle them down to a meager 512kbps as soon as the user exceeds a typically low quota. But for now, the focus is entirely on the porn debate, which shows no signs of letting up. ""A survey of the law of obscenity not only displays a palpable tension between access and distribution, but also between individual practice and social norms,"" writes Apar Gupta, a lawyer practicing in Delhi, India.

""We don't really have a relationship with them,"" Cook said, wearily, after being asked about Apple's ties to Tesla founder and CEO Elon Musk. ""I'd love Tesla to pick up CarPlay. We now have every major auto brand committing to use CarPlay, and maybe Tesla would want to do that."" ""Was that a good way to avoid the question?"" ""Was that a good way to avoid the question?"" Cook added, causing the room to erupt with laughter. Despite Cook dodging the question, another investor took the mic just minutes later saying he'd put down a deposit to reserve the very first Mac in 1984, and that nothing has made him quite as excited since then as the Tesla Model S he'd purchased. ""Every time I see it, it blows my mind,"" said the man, who did not identify himself. ""Am I insane to think something might happen here?"" ""Let me think if there's another way for me to not answer this question,"" Cook said with a smile. ""We're very focused on CarPlay.""   CarPlay plugs into supported head units from car makers and aftermarket audio companies, and does a close approximation to basic features of iOS on your car's display. That means you get Apple's maps, phone dialer, and specially developed apps from third-party companies. It's less Apple's Trojan Horse into the car world and more of a stopgap to overcome the maladies of terrible head units made by various carmakers, something those companies seem to finally be ceding control of. ""When you step in your car, you don't really want to step in a time capsule."" ""We know that when you step in your car, you don't really want to step in a time capsule and go back 20 years,"" Cook told investors at the meeting today. ""You would like the experience that you have outside the car to be the same inside the car. So that's what we are trying to do a bit with CarPlay."" Of course, head units aren't the only thing that can make cars feels like time capsules. Might Apple have some strong ideas about how to bring our vehicles into the future? And might those ideas involve acquiring Tesla? Similarities between Apple and Tesla have been drawn for years, and rightly so. Both companies have made a name for themselves after making a late entry to certain industries, developing cult-like followings with highly disruptive products. Apple did it with MP3 players, phones, and tablets, and now hopes to do the same thing with smartwatches. Tesla's done it with electric cars, and is working to perfect its technology in high-end cars with the end goal of selling more affordable models to consumers. Oh right, Apple's working on its own car Investors' questions for Cook come amid convincing rumblings that Apple is working on its own car project. Last month, The Wall Street Journal said Apple has tasked ""several hundred"" employees with something called ""Project Titan,"" a plan to build an all-electric vehicle (that will presumably come in gold!). A lawsuit filed by battery maker A123 Systems just days after The Journal's report added extra intrigue, claiming Apple had unfairly poached some of its employees to create its own lithium-ion battery technology for cars. A report from Bloomberg last month also noted that the two companies had made efforts to poach staff from one another. For its part, Apple's said to have dangled $250,000 signing bonuses and 60 percent salary increases. That hasn't stopped Tesla from plucking as many as 150 of its staff from Apple's ranks over the past few years, wooing talent to build future products. One thing is for sure, though: Apple's pockets are deep enough to buy Tesla several times over. The company has about $180 billion in cash, and has shown that it's not afraid to spend sizable chunks of it: Beats cost the company $3 billion last year. ""We've acquired 23 companies in the last 15 months,"" Cook said today. ""We try to do that as quietly as possible, but we're constantly on the lookout for talent."" One of those talents approached by Apple was Musk. Speaking to Bloomberg last year, Musk said he was approached by Apple's mergers and acquisitions head Adrian Perica, but declined to say how interested Apple had been.   Investors are tantalized by the idea of a Cook-Musk team-up, and it's easy to see why: bringing a real-world Tony Stark into Apple could promise to jump start innovation, and thwart criticism that the company has lacked a true product visionary since Steve Jobs died. But that fantasy version of Apple is unlikely to ever materialize, for one simple reason: Musk himself. ""We had conversations with Apple,"" Musk said in the same Bloomberg interview, later throwing cold water on the idea that Tesla was up for sale to anyone. ""When you stay super focused on achieving a compelling mass-market electric car, I'd be very concerned in any acquisition scenario, whoever it is, that we may become distracted from that task, which has always been the driving goal of Tesla."" Mashing up the two companies might sound like a dream to those who assemble company rosters like all-star sports teams, but everyone also knows it's about chemistry, something that's playing out right now with Apple and Beats. In the theoretical case of Tesla, Apple might get a car company, but it could also mean reining in Musk, and ultimately a culture clash that changes both companies for the worse. Correction: The reported signing bonuses and salary increases came from Apple.

It's full of super expensive, scarcely attainable cars, but just getting there is enough to bankrupt you (now that the Swiss franc has shot up in value).  Still, looking at all those shiny new motors doesn't cost anything, and my time spent inside the Palexpo venue was indeed a visual delight. Hell, even before I could walk in, there was a big, bright yellow Mercedes 4x4 stood atop a massive vertical platform showing off its mountain-climbing capabilities. It was a crazy show, it was a beautiful show, and it featured even more supercars than usual. Check out all our coverage below. The cars that Aston Martin brought to Geneva this year really couldn't have been more different. One is the most extreme supercar the company has ever produced; the other is an electric GT that looks to the future of mainstream luxury. If Geneva was a kingdom, the Regera would most certainly be king (in fact, the name literally means ""to reign"" in Swedish). Christian von Koenigsegg's latest hypercar features a symphony of gas and elecric motors delivering around 1,500 horespower, far more than any human could ever need. The very final Veyron, only the 450th ever made, has been sold, marking the conclusion of a glorious production run that's given us the fastest supercar in the world. Some are calling Bentley's curvy EXP 10 Speed 6 concept the winner among Volkswagen Group's many announcements here in Geneva this year, if not the outright winner of the entire Geneva Motor Show. That may be a stretch — there are countless beautiful, nigh-unattainable cars here — but it's still pretty easy to make the argument. Audi has been experimenting with electrics under its e-tron brand for several years, but its latest — a bespoke version of the second-generation R8 supercar — takes things to an entirely different level. As if the outgoing 458 Italia wasn't extreme enough, Ferrari has upped the ante with a revised version that features more speed, more acceleration, more horsepower, revised styling, and — here's the big one — turbocharging. Not every car makes logical sense; in fact, sometimes, it's the utter lack of logic in a vehicle that makes it so special. That's a fair way of looking at the Aventador Superveloce, an even more extreme version of Lamborghini's superlative flagship. The Quant F is the latest concept from Liechtenstein's nanoFlowCell, a wicked fast oddity with gullwing doors that's powered by an unusual ""flow cell"" drivetrain. It's ecologically friendly and quicker than some of the world's best supercars, but the refueling infrastructure simply doesn't exist today.  Perched atop a 30-foot platform outside the entrance to the Geneva Motor Show, this Mercedes is designed specifically for the needs of wealthy customers in the Middle East, including special suspensions and dust-proofing for when you go off-roading in the desert. Does this car need to be bolted to a wall? Of course it does. How else could you see inside its new canvas roof? Winner of the 2014 FIA World Endurance Championship. Aston Martin, where boss and brand merge into one synchronous whole. The Mercedes-Benz press conference kicked off with the deafening roar of this AMG GT3's engine. There were multiple spots around the Geneva show floor where the Oculus Rift was used to simulate the experience of driving (or at least riding) inside the latest cars. You could throw one of these tarps over your 30-year-old Lada and it'd still look amazing. Though the new Aventador Supeveloce took pride of place at Lambo's stand, it was this stylish custom edition of the original that grabbed my eye. Hybrid and electric cars figured prominently across the entire auto show. Custom editions of popular cars were present all around the show floor. Does all this livery really improve the SLS, though? The prize for best hairstyle of Geneva goes to Nunzio La Vecchia, the chief designer and architect of the ultra-ambitious Quant F electric supercar. At least one local news outlet opted to record its video coverage in the most mobile way possible: with just an iPhone and a microphone. A legendary car that spawned the latest generations of Ford GT. So proud is Audi of its electric car platform that it's set up a special platform to show it off in its bare form. In a sea of cars and color, red seemed to be the most popular and prominent hue. The thing about cars built for speed is that they're not built for comfort. Getting in and out of Ferrari's new twin-turbo speedster is an awkward, butt-first affair. In celebration of its Escort history, Ford brought along one of its favorite models. The Escort Mexico stood for its humble and simple good looks.",0.6068725869202061,0.39312741307979393,0.1353418982686502,808,4.9282178217821784,471,6.004246284501062,0,48,"Transportation, Photo Essay, Videos"

Below the test stand, a layer of sand protecting underlying concrete structures melted into glass from the heat. Bystanders were treated to a real-life example of how light travels faster than sound: the flames and vibrations were readily observable before the sound from the booster was heard.   it went off without a hitchThis is the first of two planned qualification tests, designed to validate the booster’s performance, and it went off without a hitch. The rocket motor fired for the full duration, thundering through the mountainside. The development of NASA’s Space Launch System is the largest engineering feat since the Apollo era. Data collected from today’s test will ensure the program is capable of launching humans to Mars and beyond. Today’s test, dubbed Qualification Motor–1 (QM–1), is a test of the SLS five-segmented solid rocket motor, meant to evaluate how the booster operates in high temperatures. The booster hardware is heated to 90°F before the propellant is ignited. The test is being run because the propellant in the booster burns faster at hotter temperatures, and that burn rate is a key component of the performance before and during launch. To prepare the booster for the test, the roll-away test stand cover was heated over the course of several days, until sensors within the booster signaled that the hardware reached the targeted 90 degrees. Before the historic first flight of SLS, the different components must be thoroughly tested. The launcher’s initial thrust capacity is expected to exceed 8 million pounds, with three-quarters of that provided by two solid rocket boosters. That’s 3.5 million pounds of thrust per booster — roughly the equivalent of the acceleration of 1,000 NASCAR stock cars. That's how you make smoke and fire, baby! Yeah! #SLSFiredUp #JourneytoMars pic.twitter.com/oUsB0WrOJu  ""A key step on the journey to Mars""Following the retirement of NASA’s shuttle fleet, the agency has been diligently working on its next heavy-lift vehicle —one capable of taking humans further than ever before. Mixed with elements from the space shuttle and Apollo eras, NASA’s Space Launch System (SLS) will be the most powerful launcher ever built with the goal of ferrying people to deep space. Throughout the two-minute-long test, the booster’s systems were monitored as all of the propellant burned. In 2016, a second booster test, Qualification Motor–2 (QM–2) will be conducted to see how the booster performs under cold conditions as well.    ""These two qualification tests are integral steps in getting the booster certified to fly on the first two planned flights of the SLS in 2018, and a key step on the journey to Mars,"" SLS Boosters Office Manager Alex Priskos told The Verge.   (NASA/Orbital ATK) Rockets are fueled with two different types of propellant — liquid and solid.  Liquid engines are controlled by nozzles and plumbing, while solids cannot be stopped once ignited. Beginning with the dawn of the shuttle era in 1981, twin strap-on solid rocket boosters have been used to achieve the necessary thrust to escape Earth’s gravity and keep the vehicle’s weight in check. The boosters operate in tandem with the vehicle’s main engines, providing the thrust necessary to escape Earth’s gravity. When it launches, SLS will employ two identical solid rocket boosters, just like the ones flown on the space shuttle, each one measuring 177 feet tall and 12 feet in diameter — larger than the Statue of Liberty is from feet to torch. On the surface, the SLS SRBs look fairly similar to the ones used during the shuttle program, and for good reason. Each SLS booster is composed of five segments, one more than in the older shuttle SRBs. And many of these boosters are being reused.The five-segment booster is capped off with a forward skirt, nose cap, and frustum at the top, and an aft skirt at the bottom, housing all of the avionics. When vertical, the aft skirt is what supports the entire weight of the motor.   (NASA/Orbital ATK) During the shuttle era, the SRBs were designed to be reused: approximately two minutes after ignition, after burnout, the SRBs would be automatically jettisoned and recovered from the Atlantic Ocean. Next they would be examined, refurbished, and flown again. The SLS SRBs won’t be reused in this way, due to monetary constraints, coupled with an abundance of booster segments and very few planned flights. the boosters will use hardware from 23 total shuttle flightsAll of the leftover parts flew on fewer than 12 shuttle flights and were all refurbished and processed in Kennedy Space Center’s Booster Fabrication Facility. The booster used in today’s static fire is full of history, spanning the entire shuttle program. At the base of the QM–1 booster sits the same aft skirt used on the very first shuttle launch. Additionally, the booster is topped off with the forward dome used to cap the right solid rocket booster on the very last flight of the shuttle program. Altogether, the boosters for QM–1, QM–2, and the currently planned exploration missions will use hardware from 23 total shuttle flights. Aside from the first and last shuttle mission, others of note are the first mission to begin assembling the International Space Station and the return to flight following the Columbia disaster. NASA and Orbital ATK have worked together to carry out three full-scale development tests leading up to this initial qualification test of the SLS booster. Once the two planned qualification tests are completed, the SLS boosters will be ready to proceed towards the maiden flight of SLS. ""When talking about our journey to Mars, we often get hung up on the destination and forget it really is a journey,"" says Charlie Precourt, vice president and general manager of Orbital ATK’s Space Launch System. The first flight test of SLS is planned for 2018 and will launch an uncrewed Orion capsule beyond low-Earth orbit before eventually carrying human to Mars, and beyond.

The artworks, made by Warhol as part of a collaboration with Commodore Amiga, had been stranded on Amiga floppy disks for almost twenty years after the artist saved them in the mid-1980s. They were only discovered and rescued from their obsolete format thanks to the chance viewing of a YouTube clip. The clip shows Warhol in 1985 at the Commodore Amiga's launch event. Warhol takes tentatively to the new hardware, perching a hand on the Amiga's mouse, before tweaking and manipulating an image of Blondie's Debbie Harry. That image is part of the collection housed at the Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh, but no other records of the artist's Amiga experimentation were kept.   The video of Warhol's forays into Amiga art piqued the interest of new media artist Cory Arcangel. In 2011, Arcangel contacted Tina Kukielski, a curator at the Carnegie Museum of Art. Together, they asked Matt Wrbican, the Warhol Museum's chief archivist, if they could search for files on the artist's disks. They were also connected to the Carnegie Mellon University Computer Club, a group, as the Warhol Museum notes, known for its collection of ""obsolete computer hardware"" and its ""prize-winning retro-computing software development."" The images included doodles and experiments with Warhol's existing works The images they found include doodles, photographs, and experiments with Warhol's existing artworks. One image is a crude recreation of his world-famous Campbell's soup can, its proportions skewed and its colors drawn in scratchy, MS Paint-esque lines. Another piece is a three-eyed doodle on a pre-rendered version of Botticelli's The Birth of Venus. The video that inspired Arcangel and others to look for Warhol's forgotten Amiga experiments is a strange juxtaposition of old and new, an artist that defined the 1960s face-to-face with the new technology of the fast-moving 1980s. But as director of the Warhol Museum Eric Shiner explains, Warhol remained interested in new technology throughout his life. ""Warhol saw no limits to his art practice. These computer generated images underscore his spirit of experimentation and his willingness to embrace new media.""

But a new Kickstarter project is now trying to make some big improvements to it by updating the bike for the age of smartphones, GPS, and fitness tracking, effectively building in many of the smartest bike accessories out there. The project is looking for CAD$100,000 (a little over USD$91,000) to fund Valour, a bike that can track your rides, give you directions, and even alert you to passing cars.  Lights on its handlebars signal when riders should turn Most of the bike's abilities require that it's connected to a smartphone. A paired app stores its riding data and allows cyclists to set up a route so that the bike can display directions. The way it gives directions is simple and clever, lighting up small LEDs on the left or right handlebar when approaching a turn to signal which direction a rider needs to go — much like the Hammerhead clip that launched last year. The bike also senses when cars are getting too close to either side of its rear wheel and will vibrate the corresponding handlebar to make its rider aware. The bike's sensors are apparently all able to stay powered just through energy built up from cycling too.  Vanhawks, the bike's manufacturer, says that multiple bikes will also begin to form a mesh network, allowing them to connect and share information with each other, like pot holes or bumpy roads that they've detected (though, it's unclear why this couldn't be done better by reporting and collecting the information through the cloud, rather than relying on every city having a sizable infrastructure of Valours). Should there be plenty of Valours in an area, the hope is that the mesh network can serve one other important purpose too: automatically detecting bikes that have been reported as missing. Whether it's a good idea to build so much tech inside of a vehicle that's often in need of repair is something riders may have to contend with, but at the least, Vanhawks says the bike parts themselves should be serviceable at a normal repair shop. And for all the potential trouble, it's likely that Valour's riders will get an early look at features that may well be offered on bicycles more widely in the future. The Valour is available as a single speed, a fixie, or with a gear hub, with prices ranging from CAD$999 to CAD$1,249. They're only being made available in the US and Canada for now, and Vanhawks is expecting the first bikes to be ready come October — a little late in the season, so buyers may not actually get riding on them until this time next year.",0.6247527099804748,0.37524729001952517,0.1880329596756153,474,4.7151898734177218,289,5.70242214532872,0,0,Design

It took years for it to release a digital version of its revered M rangefinder, and it's one of the few camera companies left that still produces film cameras, the designs of which have gone largely unchanged for 60 years. But today Leica is launching a new line of cameras that are exceptionally modern, from their design to their technology. The Leica T is the company’s first line of mirrorless, non-rangefinder cameras, with a completely new industrial design and an all-new lens mount.  Leica partnered with Audi’s design team to come up with the T’s stark, modern look. (This isn't the first time the German companies have joined forces: Audi was responsible for 2013’s Leica C point and shoot and the stunning, limited-edition titanium M9 from 2010.) It’s the first interchangeable lens camera to have a true unibody aluminum frame, which Leica machines out of a single block of metal. It’s not unlike Apple’s manufacturing process for the MacBook, though the Leica T is being manufactured in a brand-new factory in Wetzlar, Germany built specifically for it. (And in true, hand-built Leica fashion, each T chassis is subjected to 45 minutes of polishing by a skilled Leica employee before the electronics are added to it. By hand, of course.)  The T features a unique lug attachment system for straps and other accessories, and it has a pop-up flash that seamlessly hides into the camera’s chassis. It’s all very modern and offers more than a passing resemblance to the one-off Leica M auctioned off late last year that was designed by Apple’s Jonathan Ive and Marc Newson. The T is very solid and the cold touch of the aluminum feels great in your hand, though it’s a much different experience than one gets from a traditional Leica rangefinder. Aside from its clean lines and all-metal construction, the other thing that separates the T from the rest of Leica’s lineup is its lack of buttons and physical controls. There are two thumb dials, a shutter key surrounded by a power toggle, and a movie-recording key on the top of the camera. Everything else is handled by the T’s 3.7-inch 854 x 480-pixel touchscreen panel. The only viewfinder option is an external EVF, and unlike Leica’s rangefinders, the T has autofocus and comes with built-in Wi-Fi, which pairs to Leica’s new iOS app for remote control and image transfers. Inside, the T has a 16-megapixel, APS-C size CMOS image sensor built by Sony and 16GB of internal storage to go along with its SD card support. It lacks an anti-aliasing filter and can shoot at ISOs up to 12,800. For video, the T records 1080p video at 30 frames per second and records stereo sound. Leica says the rechargeable battery is good for about 400 pictures between charges, which compares favorably to other mirrorless cameras.  The new lens mount is a Leica-specific design and supports two lenses at launch: an 18-56mm (28-85mm in 35mm equivalent) f/3.5-5.6 Vario-Elmar zoom and a 23mm (35mm in 35mm equivalent) f/2 Summicron prime lens. Leica says that a 17-35mm equivalent wide-angle zoom and 80-200mm equivalent telephoto zoom are on the roadmap for the T. Though the T itself is made in Germany, its lenses are made in Japan to, quote, ""Leica specifications."" In the few minutes I spent with the new T system, there was a noticeable difference in feel and quality between the T body and the mismatched lenses that pair with it, but they are made of metal and have a level of heft lesser lenses lack. Leica is also making an M-mount adapter for the T, so virtually any Leica rangefinder lens from the last 60 years can be used with it. (Recent lenses that have Leica’s six-bit coding system will pass exposure information to the T, but all M lenses remain manual focus and manual exposure when mounted to the new camera.) Leica’s decision to forgo lots of physical buttons and switches and condense the T’s controls into its touchscreen is a bit surprising, but the system seems to be thoughtfully designed and functioned well in the brief time I spent with it. The interface offers big, smartphone-like icons for switching settings, and it makes use of swipe gestures and pinch-zooming when viewing photos. The T’s system will never really replace the tactile feel you get from manual controls and switches, but Leica is confident that even longtime rangefinder shooters will adapt to it quickly.  The Leica T will be available worldwide in silver on May 26th for about $1,850. (A black model is planned for launch later this year.) Its lenses are expected to sell for $1,800 (zoom) and $1,900 (prime), as well. Those prices aren’t nearly as high as the company’s M line retails for (the M currently sells for almost $7,000 just for the body), but there’s no mistaking that the T is not a run-of-the-mill camera for casual snap-shooters. Despite the price, Leica is expecting a lot of demand for the T (hence the new factory), and it will support the new system with a host of accessories, ranging from leather holster cases to colorful wrist straps and snap-on covers. Leica doesn’t launch new cameras often — the last time it refreshed its flagship M was in 2012 — so an entire new line is a pretty big deal for the company. The T represents the next Leica, the Leica that will have to continue building cameras and a expanding its loyal fan base for the next hundred years. While it’s a markedly different camera than what Leica is traditionally known for, the T still holds on to the company’s values of build quality, image quality, and of course, exclusivity. It’s just slightly less exclusive than before.  ",0.51206714186807,0.48793285813193,0.19237910707482173,990,4.8434343434343434,505,6.217821782178218,1,0,

Overall revenue for the quarter was $18.1 billion, up from $16.86 billion one year ago, and net income of $4.76 billion was up 40 percent over a year ago, when the company pulled in $3.38 billion in profits. Despite the fact that both those revenue and profit numbers were up a healthy margin over a year ago, it wasn't quite enough to be Wall Street expectations. Analysts had predicted $18.46 in revenue and earnings per share (EPS) of $7.11, and Google missed on both those fronts —  the actual EPS for the quarter ended up at $6.88. As usual, Google's advertising business was by far the biggest contributor to the company's bottom line — 89 percent of its total revenues were advertising-related. As for its other businesses, CFO Patrick Pichette noted that other revenue grew to $2 billion for the quarter and specifically cited strong growth in Google's Play Store. YouTube revenue was also up significantly — up over 100 percent year over year, and watch time on the service was up 50 percent year over year. As Google searches for more ways to improve its mobile advertising business, it's clear that YouTube could be the company's best chance at getting ads in front of people using their phones. Pichette also took a moment to address Google's strategy with businesses outside of its core advertising unit, saying that the company is disciplined with where it spends its money — and when projects don't work out, like Glass, the company is ready to pause, rethink, or stop them altogether. We already knew that Google was ready to significantly re-think Glass, but it's still notable to hear Google's CFO all but come out and call it a failure thus far. Google was not immune to major changes in foreign exchange rates during the quarter, something that impacted earnings for Apple, Microsoft, Facebook, and others. A stronger dollar has made overseas products more expensive, which has prompted price adjustments. For its part, Google said that the changes took about $541 million off its revenue. It's worth noting that Google's net income this quarter was buoyed by the company's sale of the Motorola division to Lenovo, a transaction that closed back in October. This resulted in a $740 million gain for the company. Related, Google's CFO Patrick Pichette said that they company had a lot of trouble meeting the demand for the company's new Nexus 6 smartphone — ""we had real issues and were unable to secure the inventory"" Google needed to meet demand.

The Chinese e-commerce giant has invested $10 million into Ouya, according to The Wall Street Journal. But that doesn't necessarily mean the Ouya box we're familiar with will be making the trip to China. The Journal says both companies have discussed integrating Ouya's existing software and game lineup — which hit the 1,000 milestone in November — to Alibaba's own set-top boxes. A deal to make that happen has yet to be finalized, according to the report, but Alibaba only made its big investment sometime last month. The idea makes sense for both companies. At least in the United States, Ouya is clearly struggling for relevancy in a market owned by Microsoft and Sony; the buzz that carried its Kickstarter campaign to $1 million in just hours was quickly forgotten about as consumers got their hands on the Xbox One and PlayStation 4. And it's even had to deal with major competition at the $99 price point. Amazon's Fire TV offers decent enough Android gaming, and it also happens to be a pretty great set-top box for watching movies, too. In some ways, the launch of Fire TV might've sealed Ouya's fate here in the US. But the company still sees big opportunity overseas — and has no problem letting other companies handle the hardware side. It's already partnered with Madcatz and Xiaomi (in China) to bring its platform and games to new devices through Ouya Everywhere, and Alibaba could extend that reach dramatically.

Now, those two ideas are merging. Whistle, a Fitbit-like gadget that charts a dog's physical activity, announced today it has acquired the GPS-enabled pet tracker Tagg. The merging of the two companies is the first step towards giving pet owners all the information they need in a single app. ""We've been really focused on providing solutions for pet owners and veterinarians,"" Ben Jacobs, CEO and co-founder of Whistle said in a phone call to The Verge. The company plans to build several ""on-collar devices that track everything you want to know about your dog."" Jacobs said the main draw of the acquisition was Tagg's GPS-based tracking solution. Tagg pairs a dog collar with a companion app that allows users to monitor the exact movements of their pets. If your dog goes missing, Tagg's app will pinpoint him on a map. Tagg introduced its GPS Plus device at CES this year, which updated the product to include a temperature-monitoring device.  Whistle's current draw for pet owners is a big picture data set of an animal's overall health: it uses an accelerometer to try to determine if a dog is walking, sleeping, or running. Using Bluetooth for a mobile app and Wi-Fi for remote monitoring, Whistle charts changes in a dog's daily activity and alerts owners to sudden, potentially worrisome changes. ""We look at Jawbone, or Fitbit, it's the same idea here."" Tagg was founded in 2010 as a subsidiary of Qualcomm, but was independently owned at the time of purchase. It operates under a slightly different business model than Whistle's one-time fee. Because the Tagg collar uses a cell chip, users must also pay for a monthly data plan. Current Tagg users won't be abandoned in the acquisition. ""The key in the immediate term is we'll support any consumer using any device today."" Jacobs said. ""The goal is to bring [the companies] together into one single software platform. We look at Jawbone, or Fitbit, it's the same idea here."" Eventually, Whistle hopes to completely subsume the Tagg brand into its own. Tagg's web app will be integrated into the Whistle platform. Whistle plans to create a complete line of devices, each catering to the different needs of pet owners. For example, one device might only monitor a dog's sleeping patterns, while another might compare his activity to that of other breeds. Tagg's GPS component will only be available on certain devices with an additional monthly fee. Whistle plans to create a line of different devices for pets ""Imagine a single refresh of the app,"" Jacobs says, ""You're no longer using the Tagg app. You'll start using the Whistle experience and using that platform."" At CES this year, Tagg announced a partnership with Alarm.com, unveiling plans to alert home automation systems to pet activity. For example, when your dog goes outside, Alarm.com will shut off your home's air conditioning and turn it back on when the dog returns. Whistle's acquisition of Tagg is further proof that the tide of multi-functional gadgets into our daily lives isn't slowing anytime soon.

PLEASE DO IT ASAP!!!!"" Earlier this week, New York Times columnist Farhad Manjoo predicted that Uber's biggest impact on the world would not be in transforming transportation, but in changing the labor market and the way we think about work. He may be right. Uber's explosion is the envy of employers everywhere. And those employers are well aware that Uber became a $40 billion company by operating as if its drivers are not Uber employees. Drivers are fighting to be reimbursed for expenses Uber marketed itself as a technological innovation, not a car company, and classified its drivers as independent contractors — selling them on the arrangement by promising flexible work hours and the freedom to be their own boss. The ""Uberization of work,"" Manjoo argued, means that other companies will also try to ""efficiently allocate human beings."" Efficiency, however, is in the eye of the employer. Before this labor revolution can take place, Uber will have to prove its world-changing business model isn't screwing over drivers. Two lawsuits, one against Uber and one against Lyft (a smaller, rival e-hailing company), filed on behalf of drivers are currently winding their way through San Francisco federal court. The suits argue that drivers are employees entitled to be reimbursed for expenses like gas and vehicle maintenance that they are currently paying out of pocket. Each case is seeking class action status. Arguments at yesterday's summary judgment hearing for Lyft do not bode well for Uber's case, which will be heard at a similar hearing this afternoon. According to Reuters, US District Judge Vincent Chhabria said California legal precedents ""point pretty strongly in the direction"" that ""people who do the kinds of things that Lyft drivers do here are employees."" Uber is on the defensive A ruling against Lyft or Uber could ""force the companies to pay social security, workers' compensation, and unemployment insurance,"" thereby deflating the value of Uber, Lyft, as well as other on-demand apps like the grocery-delivery app Instacart or the housecleaning app Handy. Shannon Liss-Riordan, the lawyer representing the plaintiffs in both suits, said trying to classify employees as independent contractors is a time-honored practice. ""It's nothing new,"" Liss-Riordan told The Verge. ""This is just the latest lingo."" For example, she said, ""FedEx has tried to argue that it's not in the delivery business. They claimed to be a logistics network. It doesn't pass the straight-face test."" Her firm, Lichten & Liss-Riordan PC, represented the FedEx drivers in a lawsuit. The 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco recently ruled that FedEx drivers are employees, but the case is ongoing. Lyft told The Verge it would not comment pending litigation, and Uber did not respond to questions. Dropping F-bombs on drivers At this point, it's hard to believe that any legal or regulatory threat can hold Uber back for long. Even the endless succession of nightmarish headlines fade in the face of cheap fares summoned with a smartphone. About a week ago, Uber closed a $1.6 billion round of funding, bringing its total financing to $4.9 billion. However, this case seems to have put Uber in serious defense mode. The company used paper-thin arguments to try to keep communication between Uber employees and Uber drivers used as evidence under seal. Newly public emails, submitted by the plaintiff, some of which were first published by Buzzfeed, show what Uber has to be defensive about. Some background: a significant factor in classifying employees vs. independent contractors is whether they can be terminated at will. According to Liss-Riordan, Uber was trying to keep the emails under seal because it showed ""the cavalierness that Uber managers used"" when deciding to deactivate a driver. Uber tried to get this email calling a driver ""FUCKING HORRIBLE"" sealed because of ""coarse language which could potentially embarrass that employee,"" according to an order from Judge Chen. Chen denied the request because ""an employee’s use of the 'fword' in a business communication is not so shocking in today’s world,"" he wrote. The F-bomber was Brian McMullen, who worked as a community manager for Uber at the time.  This email between McMullen and Scott Munro, then a San Francisco Operations Manager, extols the joys of firing a driver by phone. Uber tried to get it sealed because it allegedly contained ""commercially valuable, non-public information regarding Uber's strategies."" Judge Chen dismissed the claim as ""seriously misleading.""   Liss-Riordan claimed she won her argument in the FedEx case in part because FedEx managers do ride-alongs with drivers four times a year. In contrast, she said, Uber and Lyft are ""constantly evaluating their drivers in real time"" and then ""using that information to terminate."" She argued that Uber and Lyft managers change the minimum rating from time to time and ""use discretion to decide who to terminate and who to give a chance to."" In another unsealed exchange, a driver complains that tech issues with the Uber app have unfairly cut into his wages. Bridgette Tuquero, an operations and logistics manager for Uber in San Diego, first blames Verizon. When the driver doesn't back down, she suggests he quits. The driver, who claims to be doing a Masters in Economics, responds by critiquing Uber's business model. In return, Tuquero sends him a link to a TechCrunch article about Uber securing another $258 million in investment, noting, ""Google thinks we're a pretty good business model.""   Another sign that Uber is concerned? Last week, David Plouffe, the former Obama campaign manager, who is now the head of policy and strategy at Uber, introduced a study commissioned by Uber showing that 78 percent of drivers said they were ""satisfied"" driving for Uber and 71 percent said their income had improved. The statistically insignificant study, culled from 601 drivers (only 11 percent of those surveyed), was co-authored by Princeton University economist Alan Krueger, who overlapped with Plouffe as an advisor to President Obama. Liss-Riordan said there are drivers working 60 or 70 hours a week who don't even make minimum wage after gas and other expenses are factored in. Uber and Lyft ""tried to shift the cost of running a car company to their drivers,"" she added. ""Both companies have saved a massive amount of labor cost.""

The NSA, as first reported in German media, obtained information on thousands of ""selectors,"" search terms like mobile phone numbers and IP addresses the NSA provided before the BND turned over additional information it had stored. Since the revelations produced by documents from Edward Snowden — including the fact that the NSA spied on Angela Merkel's personal phone — Germany's relationship with the US government has become tense and distrustful.

In a filing posted today, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals writes that the phone records program ""exceeds the scope of what Congress has authorized,"" overturning a decision from 2013. The American Civil Liberties Union brought its case against Director of National Intelligence James Clapper after Edward Snowden revealed that a government surveillance program was collecting metadata — including time stamps, phone numbers, and durations of calls — for millions of phone numbers. The NSA justified the program under Section 215 of the Patriot Act, which allows the government to collect ""tangible things"" relevant to a national security investigation. A federal judge originally said that the ACLU couldn't establish it had been harmed by this collection, but the three-member appeals court disagrees. ""The sheer volume of information sought is staggering.""""It is not disputed that the government collected telephone metadata associated with the appellants’ telephone calls,"" writes circuit judge Gerard Lynch. Whether or not the government searches through this information — which it's said the ACLU can't prove — it could still potentially be a violation of the group's Fourth Amendment protections against ""searches and seizures."" Knowing the information was being collected could also have a chilling effect on freedom of speech, violating the First Amendment. This doesn't mean it's ruled the program unconstitutional; in fact, it explicitly says it's not dealing with that issue. But it calls the problem ""sufficiently daunting"" that Congress should address it, and it's not disputing the ACLU's grounds to sue over the possibility. The court took issue with the program's secrecy — it's reviewed only internally, by a court whose decisions are secret — and with the administration's claim that Congress didn't intend to let its targets bring complaints. If a huge number of lawsuits could disrupt national security operations, it's only because of ""the existence of orders authorizing the collection of data from millions of people,"" the ruling says. And it brings up one of the biggest criticisms of the program: that it's too vague and sweeping to be justified by Section 215. ""Such an expansive concept of 'relevance' is unprecedented and unwarranted,"" writes Lynch. ""The sheer volume of information sought is staggering."" Section 215 is already expiring next monthWhere Judge William Pauley III started his ruling with a warning about terrorism after the ""bold jujitsu"" of 9/11, this ruling is critical of the ongoing, expansive fight against it. ""The government effectively argues that there is only one enormous 'anti‐terrorism' investigation, and that any records that might ever be of use in developing any aspect of that investigation are relevant to the overall counterterrorism effort,"" writes Lynch. He warns that this is a tortured reading of Section 215's limits. leaning too heavily on the fact that Congress hasn't explicitly cracked down on the NSA's activity. (Some members of the House of Representatives say they weren't even made aware of the program.) Its interpretation would require a ""drastic expansion"" of the intended scope of Section 215 and similar rules. The ACLU has asked for a ruling that would stop the NSA from collecting information, at least until the issue was finally decided. But Section 215 is expiring next month, and Lynch writes that whatever Congress decides to do could ""profoundly alter the legal landscape."" If it's reauthorized, lower courts will have to go over the legal issues with the new rules.

As a reader of The Verge, I’m guessing you probably subscribe to at least one streaming video service. Probably Netflix or Hulu, or maybe even Amazon’s video service that comes bundled with your Prime membership. Great, on-demand streaming for a fixed monthly price is the future of media consumption. Problem is, the video services you subscribe to are locked to your home country’s borders by arcane copyright laws. Once you leave for vacation or a business trip, there’s a good chance you won’t have access to your curated playlists after you land.    If you’re traveling outside of the Americas, Western Europe, Australia, or New Zealand then — surprise — your Netflix subscription won’t work. And even when you are traveling within those areas the video catalogs will most likely differ by country. Fortunately, this is the internet: there’s always a workaround. Paid services like Unblockus, Getflix, and Media Hint get around geoblocking by tricking websites and internet services into thinking you’re still at home. Just follow their simple instructions to point laptops, tablets, and smartphones to your chosen service’s DNS servers. Presto, you can now stream all your favorite Netflix shows from Italy while regular Italians wait for the October launch. Unlike VPNs, DNS proxy services won’t slow down your connection — they simply mask your location and then get out of the way so that you’re directly connected with the content you’re trying to stream. Only a small amount of data (your IP address and the sites you’re requesting) flows through their servers and you can always disable / re-enable it by editing your DNS settings. Unblockus is perhaps the best known and most expensive of the lot at $4.99 per month. It’s also a service I can vouch for having used it since 2012. Getflix and Media Hint are cheaper versions with prices starting at $3.95. Savvy travelers will note that Unblockus and Media Hint both offer seven-day free trials while Getflix’s free trial lasts 14 days — none require a credit card to try. ""Free"" IP proxy services also exist but you have to wonder what that means when it comes to dealing with your personal information (Unblockus, Getflix, and Media Hint all say they won't share your details). We all learned a valuable lesson from Hola, right? Free or not, each DNS service places a heavy emphasis on masking your location to a US address because, let’s face it, that’s where the most popular TV and films are produced. Of course, you can use DNS proxies anytime, not just while traveling. Countries have borders, the internet shouldn’t.

I filed on to the top of the building with hundreds of others and pushed my way through to the edge. The crowd stood shoulder to shoulder, all facing the looming skyscraper to the north. Then 40 stacked projectors on the top of a nearby building switched on, and the Empire State Building became the world’s largest tombstone. Nokia might be expanding into areas like VR, but it's no longer in the maps business — it's just sold its Here unit to a consortium of German carmakers including BMW, Audi, and Mercedes' parent company Daimler. The final price was €2.8 billion, or just over $3 billion. Each partner will hold an equal stake in Here and none will seek to acquire a majority interest. The Wall Street Journal reported two weeks ago that the deal had been agreed in principle, and that the consortium plans to invite other carmakers to invest in the new business. The FCC approved AT&T's $48.5 billion takeover of DirecTV just under two weeks ago, and we're already seeing the first results — new bundles that the carrier describes as the ""first-ever nationwide package of TV and wireless services."" DirecTV packages range from $50 to $125 a month, and AT&T is offering a $10 discount when combined with wireless subscription. For example, the company's $160 plan with 10GB of shareable data and four phone lines would run you $200 if you added the $50 DirecTV Select option.

Dota 2 is Valve's most-played game, and while it's free to play and compete in, it's also one of the company's most profitable properties by virtue of a thriving in-game economy that allows players to buy and trade cosmetic items. That's a substantial reason for the inflated $18 million prize pool: it has been funded chiefly by contributions from fans buying in-game items to make their heroes look more fierce and intimidating. Dota 2 is a terribly addictive game and it makes for a fine competitive spectacle as well, judging by the viewer numbers it attracts on streaming services like Twitch. It isn't quite on the same level of popularity as the similar League of Legends — another team-based battle game where the goal is to destroy the enemy's base — but The International is certainly the most prominent tournament in the genre of competitive gaming. To tune in to TI5 — which begins with playoffs today and culminates with a Grand Final on Saturday, August 8th — you can use the YouTube stream above or the Twitch or Valve links listed below. YouTube is most convenient because it lets you rewind to watch any action you might have missed over the previous two hours. And don't worry if you're not familiar with Dota: Valve has a newcomer stream that tries to explain the basic mechanics of the game. You'll still feel lost and confused by some of the esotericism and complexity of the game, but even if you don't fully grasp it, there are plenty of explosive battles to keep the excitement high.

Warm sunlight streams in from the windows, birds chirp sweetly outside. Across the table from me is a wide-eyed little hedgehog, his huge, bobbing spines swept up behind him like the spiky 'do of a bassist in the most non-threatening pop-punk band ever. Either he's gigantic, or I have become very small, because as we sit we are nearly eye to eye with each other. It's his birthday, and he's getting ready to blow out the candle on his cake; or rather, a big, juicy birthday strawberry. He closes his eyes and breathes his wish in a little desperate mutter: ""I wish I had a friend!"" The candle blows out, and he gazes at it longingly with his big, tragic saucer eyes. Then he looks at me, and somehow his little visage becomes even more tragic.   This is Henry, and this is Henry,  Story Studio's latest venture into narrative VR experiences. The new short premiered last week in Los Angeles, and it's the studio's latest attempt at a proof-of-concept for virtual reality stories. It's coming on the heels of their debut short Lost, which premiered earlier this year at the Sundance Film Festival. While Lost was a shorter, more impressionistic scene, Henry goes unapologetically for the heartstrings, and does so over a longer runtime of about 12 minutes. And while it's still limited in scale, it continues the incremental exploratory process of the possibilities of VR storytelling — or at least, what Oculus Story Studio thinks those possibilities are. ""It's not better or worse than film, it's a separate thing."" Narrative VR experiences are still very much in their infancy, as anyone who has either thrown or had thrown at them a bunch of money to explore its potential (to make a bunch of money, inevitably) will tell you. ""We're kind of at the very beginning of VR; it's a brand new medium,"" said Saschka Unseld, creative director of Oculus Story Studio during his introduction at the Henry presentation. ""It's not better or worse than film, it's a separate thing."" A few guidelines are beginning to make themselves clear in these first outings, though, namely that with the absence of cuts, storytellers must find new ways to direct and cue an audience's attention. Some have done this with sound, some have done this by ""moving the viewer"" on a track to guide them through an experience; essentially a 360-degree one-shot. Justin Lin, whose Google Spotlight Story short Help! premiered at I/O earlier this year, compared it to theater direction, which so far, seems pretty apt. It's curious, then, that the bulk of these early outings have narratives that are far from what you'd see on off-Broadway. Lost and Help! focus on giant robots and aliens respectively; other experiences use the power of sensory immersion for noble social agendas but don't quite feel like ""movies."" Oculus is touting Henry as a more character-oriented experience, a more overt exploration into how we might empathize with fictional beings we encounter in VR. But rather than set you down next to a living, breathing human, they've put you in a room with a CGI hedgehog. My time with Henry was ultimately a little disappointing, and the sound was the first big fumble. My VR experience is still somewhat limited compared to many of my Verge colleagues, but I still have yet to have a satisfying audio setup for any demos I've done. Virtual reality cannot merely be virtual if it is to be truly absorbing; I need over-ear noise-canceling headphones or I'm never truly going to forget that I'm standing in a suite with a technician who is doing everything in his or her power to make sure I don't go careening into a wall. But sound can be fixed with a piece of equipment. The bigger problem is that throughout the duration of Henry I never felt like I was watching anything but a cartoon. In its opening, particularly, when I was merely sitting in the living room, waiting for my hedgehog buddy to come out of the kitchen, I felt like I was in an opening scene of a Final Fantasy game, where I had to walk into the right square of the grid to prompt some sprites to run in and start talking to me. Except I couldn't really walk in Henry, so I just looked around at the soft edges of my non-threatening environs and waited for the thing to start. And once it did, and once I ""met"" Henry, I found myself incredibly aware of, distracted, even, by his status as rendered object. I think animation can be a uniquely transcendent form of filmmaking. Hayao Miyazaki is one of my favorite filmmakers (filmmakers, not animators) of all time; watching the exuberant, seemingly boundless frames of old Silly Symphony shorts fills me with singular joy. But part of me wonders if it's not the best way to begin our forays into VR narratives. I had a mostly untested theory a few months ago that if VR filmmaking did actually catch on, it would lead to a pronounced resurgence in practical effects, mostly because when you're that immersed in something, the artificial elements are even more noticeable. (Practical effect-driven horror in particular seems like a good, if terrifying genre to explore in 360 degrees.) And Henry, no matter how big and sad its title character's eyes were, didn't do much to sway me from that theory. Story Studio's default to computer animation can be explained by the Pixar past of two of its principle directors: Unseld previously worked as a layout artist and director (his film The Blue Umbrella is among the most beloved Pixar shorts), and technical director Max Planck worked for the studio for 10 years. What's interesting is how much that ends up affecting how their stories work as pieces of technology, in addition to familiar Lasseterian touches and storytelling beats. I spoke to Planck after the demo about the future of live-action projects at Story Studio. With VR, he says, ""You know you have something on your face. You know you're in virtual reality. I would rather take you to some place you can't experience in the real world."" The ability to do depth tracking and real-time rendering is also something that simply can't be accomplished with live action at this point. ""We would love if we find a way to get actors and actresses into an experience where you could move around. But so far, being in a game engine, in a real-time experience, is what you can do with modern technology."" For Planck, the depth factor is a huge part of what is going to get a viewer invested in a VR film. ""For me, personally, that is what convinced me. That is what got me to quit my job,"" he says. Planck is also a gamer, and had been interested in the possibilities of more narrative-driven games, which allow for much more of that variable narrative experience. ""At the time, this was when the first version of the Rift came out, and it did not allow you to walk and move around,"" he says. ""And then I saw the version where you could, and my mind was blown, and I said, 'This is what I need to do for the rest of my life.'"" In the version of Henry that I saw, you cannot walk around Henry's treehouse. You can lean forward and back, so long as you stay on a small circular carpet (which exists both in the demo room and is recreated underneath you in the short). Even that degree of mobility does lend itself to a more natural viewing experience; you don't feel so much like a bobblehead on a stationary pole. But is that real-time depth rendering worth the sacrifice of live action? I suppose it depends on the viewer, and what they personally expect from and get out of their moviegoing experiences. And here's, perhaps, where the types of creatives you have pioneering a medium make all the difference in how that medium establishes itself. Oculus is a tech company, Story Studio's team has a computer animation background. Their shorts are products that get upgrades; the Lost that screened at the Tribeca Film Festival was different than the Lost that premiered at Sundance. The idea of immersion is a matter of technical innovation, not of more elusive qualities like good writing or a fleeting, unscripted look on a character's face. And no matter what hedging comments they make in these early stages, Story Studio's VR experiences can't help but poise themselves as a potential upgrade to traditional film. Because before he told the audience that VR was not meant to replace film, Unseld more or less established his goals as creative director by tellingly describing Story Studio as an attempt to recapture something that had been lost. ""As we all grow older, I feel like we lose this childlike sense of awe and wonder that we had when we used to see movies,"" he said. ""We realize they're not just films; they're light thrown on a canvas, and there are actors, and nothing is real, and we become disillusioned with these things. To me, that loss of that sense of wonder and awe that I had was one of the saddest things."" I agree with him; as a film lover, that is one of the saddest things I can think of. It's also something I don't experience at all, at least in the films I love. I can get completely caught up in a conversation between David Foster Wallace and David Lipsky in The End of the Tour, despite being fully aware that it's really Jason Segel and Jesse Eisenberg I'm watching on screen. I can be moved to helpless tears by the dizzyingly abstract emotional climax of Isao Takahata's The Tale of Princess Kaguya, despite being able to actually make out individually hand-painted frames in the animation. Narrative film involves a suspension of disbelief, sure, but at its best it also creates a strong connection between the viewer and the real-life people who brought it to life. It's not about being removed from the world. It's about clarifying and strengthening your connection to the world, through experiences that have been clarified and strengthened by countless writers, directors, actors, and animators. Could it be we're overthinking this? That Unseld and Planck think those experiences can be upgraded by the ability to lean forward says a lot about the direction Story Studio is poised to take. And it's not an incorrect direction, necessarily, it's just one that doesn't have a lot in common with any of the other forms of storytelling we've been swept away by in the last thousand years. I'm probably a bad test subject for this particular short, because if there is one kind of film I can't help but see the seams of — aka Unseld's ""saddest thing"" — it's computer animated films (and I realize I'm in the minority with this, so as always, your mileage may vary). For all its technical superiority, nothing in Henry made my spine tingle the way the Wild — The Experience did, despite a crummier resolution and an even worse sound experience. To find myself sitting in a clearing with actual human being actors Reese Witherspoon and Laura Dern was completely weird and disorienting, but more in the way it would be if I was watching them from the front row at the opening night of Wild! The Musical. I found myself reassessing them as human performers in a way traditional film would never let me; it let me examine their characters with a freedom I found myself almost too embarrassed to exercise. If the attendant at CES hadn't been yelling ""Can you see them? Can you see them?!"" every 30 seconds, I might have actually gotten lost in it. Could it be we're overthinking this? Wouldn't it be interesting just to set the camera down in the middle of the stage at a production of A Streetcar Named Desire and see how that goes? Why try to emulate the qualities of games and rides (plenty of which can be found in other not-as-fledgling corners of the VR world) if you're trying to continue a tradition of storytelling that for thousands of years has hinged on the appeal of watching people interact with each other? In a film economy where the biggest movies mostly emulate video games and rides, these are all rhetorical questions, of course. But when Richard Linklater's unveils his 5-hour coming-of-age VR experience at SXSW, I'll be first in line.

During their presentation at the Television Critics Association tour, Amazon Studios announced that its hit comedy-drama's new batch of episodes will debut on Prime Instant Video December 4th. The show's first season focused on the transition and complicated family life of Maura Pfefferman (Jeffrey Tambor), a retired college professor whose adult children are all grappling with their own sexuality and gender. The release date announcement is coming on the heels of the series receiving 11 Emmy nominations, including nods in many of the ceremony's major categories (including Outstanding Comedy Series). Transparent became an immediate sensation upon its premiere last February, both for its subject matter — it's one of the first TV shows to feature a transgender character in a leading role — and the caliber of its writing, acting, and direction. The show was created by veteran TV writer Jill Soloway in the wake of her own father's transition. It was renewed for a second season last October, and renewed again for a third season this June — well before the second season was even set to air. Amazon's faith in the show was further justified by the bucketful of Emmy nominations it received, the first such recognition for the company's original TV programming.

Autodesk owns the Maya and 3ds Max modeling software, the Scaleform rendering engine, and a variety of animation and texture-making tools. But the meat of the game will (usually) be made in an engine like Unity or Unreal, both of which have spent years courting developers with low prices and approachable tools. On August 19th, though, they'll see a new competitor: Autodesk's own engine, called Stingray. Stingray was first announced in March, but it's technically existed for several years as an engine called Bitsquid, which Autodesk acquired in 2014. Bitsquid is behind, among a handful of other games, chaotic cooperative shooter Helldivers. The core of Bitsquid, says Autodesk's head of games Frank Delise, isn't changing much. But among other things, it's using a different interface and is more tightly integrated with the rest of Autodesk's design tools. ""We really liked that the engine was separated from the user interface, so we can make very user-specific versions of the technology,"" says Delise. It's hard to tell exactly how good Stingray games will look — the major test for any engine — but the screenshots don't look too bad. Autodesk bought the company that made its engine last year The theory is that while it may not be easy to learn the finer workings of Stingray, anyone on a game development team — like an artist, animator, or texture designer — should be able to preview their work simply and in near-real time, especially when Autodesk owns every step of the process. Make or modify a character in Maya, for example, and it can (in a controlled demo, at least) show up almost instantly in the Stingray editor. There's also a visual, drag-and-drop programming tool to perform simple tasks without learning the Lua scripting language that Stingray uses.   ""If you're a AAA developer, what you do is buy 3D tools, and then buy other tools that you need or make them in-house, and then you either buy a game engine or you build your own engine, and then you get your teams to customize this massive pipeline around it,"" says Adams. ""What we're trying to do is create more of that out of the box."" Autodesk is also promoting the Creative Market, which it acquired last year, as a place for developers to buy and sell models or other game assets. ""Free is always such a weird thing."" One of the most obvious differences between Stingray and its competition is that the general public can't get it for free. Like its other products, Autodesk sells subscriptions to Stingray; it costs $30 a month for ""basic"" support, with discounts for longer commitments and a free option for students. Unity, by contrast, offers its basic editor and engine for free, with a $75 monthly subscription for team licenses and additional features. Epic charges a 5 percent royalty for Unreal Engine 4 games that make more than $3,000 per quarter. ""Free is always such a weird thing. I like this way because it's more basic,"" says Adams. ""You don't have to worry about suddenly owing a whole lot of money to somebody else once your game takes off."" He notes that Stingray will be included with a subscription to the lightweight Maya LT later this year. This still aims it at developers that are closer to the professional side of things, not people learning how to make games for the first time. Easy access to engines like Unity helped make high-gloss game design accessible to more developers, lowering the bar of entry for our current boom of indie and mobile games. The actual staying power of Stingray has yet to be seen, but if nothing else, it's introducing more competition into the field.",0.5067207909954843,0.4932792090045157,0.17883911612626757,633,4.8230647709320698,367,5.7220708446866482,0,2,"Culture, Entertainment, Gaming"

Yesterday, the company released a comprehensive explanation of its Hyperion rendering engine, which simulates how sunlight works. Hyperion uses a technique called path tracing, which is an advancement on ray-tracing technology; this simulates the way light works in the real world, except in reverse. Rays from the Sun bounce off all objects, enabling us to see them — but it's difficult for computers to render billions of rays in real time. Instead of calculating the path of every ray of light in a scene, Hyperion only renders light seen by the camera, bundling all the rays traveling in the same direction into a ""path"" for efficiency.

Unfortunately, the company is still withholding crucial information like pricing and release date — but those probably aren't too far off. We're not even yet positive which phones it works with; if history is any indication, it'll be limited to Samsung's more recent devices. In today's press release, Samsung has revealed that its latest Tizen-powered watch will come in two models: the regular Gear S2 and a Gear S2 classic, which is aimed at consumers who ""prefer more timeless watch design."" Gear S2 Classic features a black finish with a matching leather band, so it's being positioned to take on high-end Android Wear options like the LG Watch Urbane (and of course the Apple Watch). The regular model will be available in a dark gray case with gray band or in silver with a white band. Like Apple, Samsung says the packaged options can easily be swapped for different styles.  The Gear S2's 1.2-inch circular display has a resolution of 360 x 360 and is surrounded by a rotating bezel. That's one way you'll control it, and there are also home and back buttons meant to make dealing with notifications on your wrist less annoying. NFC is built in, with Samsung claiming it'll eventually be able to make mobile payments — presumably through Samsung Pay, but there's no confirmation of that just yet. Samsung is promising battery life ranging between two and three days. There's one big downside: the Gear S2 won't have access to Android Wear's growing collection of third-party apps. But at a bare minimum, Samsung says it'll keep you in tune with all of your texts, calendars, emails, breaking news, and fitness goals. (A 3G-compatible model will allow for voice calls, as well.) A 24-hour activity log will keep track of your fitness progression, with the watch serving up reminders to get you moving towards those targets. Beyond the built-in apps, Samsung will only say that it's working with developers to expand the ecosystem of what's available on Tizen; obviously it's a long way behind Android Wear and the Apple Watch in terms of selection.

Despite the Tizen handicap, what we've seen of the Gear S2 so far looks pretty slick, especially the watch faces and general user interface. If nothing else, it looks like a significant improvement over Samsung's previous Tizen wearables. This seems to be a Samsung that's turned a corner in terms of design, although the app icons definitely borrow very heavily from Apple. Elsewhere Samsung is doing more unique things. Still, we'll need to reserve more thorough judgement until we've used the Gear S2 firsthand (and know how much Samsung plans to charge for the thing).

In the UK, many people also use contactless cards that work without any other authentication, so the limit is in place to prevent easy fraud and theft if the card is lost. Some retailers have been operating terminals with a higher transaction limit for Apple Pay, but today's move raises the bar across the nation.  Visa director calls contactless ""the new normal"" The cards association's data shows that contactless payments are on the rise in the UK. The first half of 2015 saw customers make £2.5 billion in contactless payments — that's more than the whole of 2014, when £2.32 billion was spent. With Apple Pay launching in the UK in July and the payment limit being increased today, those figures are only going to rise. UK and Ireland managing director Kevin Jenkins says that contactless is becoming ""the 'new normal'"" in the region. Terminals across the country will start to be updated from today, but the assocation says it may take a few weeks before national coverage is complete.",0.5013608646831578,0.49863913531684223,0.6642295621973117,291,4.8178694158075599,182,5.3241758241758239,0,0,"Apple, Mobile, Tech"

Variety says that Apple's plans are in the early stages, but that the company has increased its interest in producing its own TV shows or movies in recent months. The company reportedly made an offer to ex-Top Gear hosts Jeremy Clarkson, James May and Richard Hammond in July, before the trio were eventually snapped up by Amazon.

Apple made an offer to Top Gear hosts Jeremy Clarkson, James May and Richard Hammond It's too early to say whether Apple intends to follow Netflix's monthly subscription model exactly, or simply make shows available on iTunes as it has with several independent movies in recent years, but the recent launch of Apple Music has shown the company is not shy of copying other streaming services in terms of payment structure. Apple Music could serve as something of a test bed for Apple's reported TV ambitions, combining outside content in the form of music with original programming like Apple's Beats 1 radio station. It's understood that Apple has been in negotiations with networks and production companies to feature on its own internet TV service for years, meaning the company may already have the relationships in place to produce its own content. Original programming would be a feather in the cap of any such service, working as shows such as Orange Is The New Black and House of Cards have for Netflix as differentiators in an increasingly crowded market.

In a new study on AC adoption trends, researchers found that air conditioning adoption is likely to boom over the rest of this century, eventually driving residential electricity usage up 83 percent. The study is being published today in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.  ""This is gonna cost a lot of money."" Air conditioner adoption is in many ways a good thing — it's no secret that a cooler home will make living there more pleasant — but it also leads to some big issues. More air conditioners mean more energy needed to run them, and more electricity being made means more greenhouse gases going up into the air. ""I think this is a huge challenge,"" Lucas Davis, an Associate Professor at UC Berkeley's Haas School of Business and lead author of the paper, tells The Verge. ""This is just a huge challenge for electricity markets, for electricity systems, for electricity infrastructure. This means an enormous increase in the need for electricity generation and transmission. This is gonna cost a lot of money."" And that's money that will need to come from developing countries, which will drive AC growth. Davis and his co-author, Paul Gertler, a professor at UC Berkeley's Haas School of Business, looked at billing data from over 25 million Mexican households to determine how temperature increases drove air conditioning use. They saw that, relative to a day between 65 degrees and 70 degrees Fahrenheit, monthly electricity consumption rose 3.2 percent for every day the weather went above 90 degrees. The study also looks at how rising incomes across the globe will lead to more households with air conditioning. Looking at a smaller data set of 27,000 households, the researchers saw that air conditioning ownership is near zero in cooler areas, regardless of income. In hotter areas, however, AC ownership grew by 2.7 percent for every additional $1,000 in annual household income. ""We had kind of vaguely known that this was a big deal, but until we looked at it, I didn't realize how big of a deal this really is,"" Davis says. ""That's because air conditioners use a lot of electricity."" More energy means more emissions At current levels of air conditioner ownership, residential energy usage may only increase around 15.4 percent by the end of the century. But once you factor in what will likely be the dramatic growth of air conditioning, the end-of-century estimate shoots up to an 83 percent increase. That's nearly double the amount of residential energy use overall — not just the energy used by air conditioners. The researchers believe these findings apply not just to Mexico, but globally. In part, that seems to be because their study somewhat duplicates earlier research, which has come to similar conclusions. But even if the study isn't entirely novel, ""their finding is still very relevant — as not so many have appreciated the consequences of this,"" Detlef van Vuuren, an environmental change professor at Utrecht University who was not involved with the study, tells The Verge in an email. Because of the growing energy use, AC adoption will likely lead to a ""huge increase"" in carbon dioxide emissions, Davis says, feeding climate change. Van Vuuren, who has done previous research on air conditioner adoption, believes that climate change could actually even out the effects of growing AC costs. ""Additional warming in warmer areas is most likely also accompanied by warming in cold areas, leading to less heating demand,"" he writes. ""In the first part of the century, actually the reduced energy consumption for heating dominates."" The increased energy consumption from air conditioners won't hit until the second half of the century, he's found; though energy usage would only even out on a global level, not necessarily in individual countries. ""We should be celebrating this."" Davis doesn't necessarily see that happening, however. Because income growth will lead to so many people buying their first air conditioners over the next 80-or-so years, the increased energy usage is likely going to be huge nonetheless. ""You could keep temperatures exactly the same,"" Davis says, and you'd still see that huge increase in air conditioner ownership and electricity usage. That's likely to start in current middle-income countries; Davis names Brazil, Mexico, and China, where AC adoption is already skyrocketing — sales have doubled there over the last five years, with China's 2013 AC sales reaching eight times the total sold in the US. ""Next you go to places like Indonesia, Philippines, Nigeria,"" Davis says. ""I'm talking about places that are a little lower income than Mexico, Brazil, and China, but that are very hot."" India, which due to its larger population and hotter climate could reach 12 times the cooling demand of the US, will likely hit later in the century, too. (In the US, where air conditioning is already widespread, increased adopt is unlikely to be an issue.) ""We should be celebrating this. This is people being more comfortable,"" Davis says. ""But let's be clear: this is gonna require an enormous increase in electricity infrastructure."" So while there's an obvious climate change element to this finding — growing carbon dioxide emissions as electricity use rises — the bigger story to Davis is how that demand will be met. Citing others' research, Davis says these infrastructure costs will quickly run into the trillions. That could change, however. ""As sales of air conditioners increase, that creates incentives for manufacturers of air conditioners to find ways of making them better, and that includes more energy-efficient air conditioners,"" Davis says. The increased adoption will likely lead to less electricity usage and carbon dioxide emissions because of the market's response. ""How much technological change will there be?"" Davis asks. ""That's a huge question that's hard to answer.""",0.6367275842169617,0.36327241578303826,0.16755087892397805,1003,5.1465603190428713,485,6.0927835051546388,0,0,Science

And from the inchworm, the engineers borrowed the wall-climbing bot's method of locomotion: while one half of its body moves forward, the other stays locked in place. This allows the bot to climb walls without losing its grip.  A close-up of the tiny rubber spikes on the robots' feet.

The patches are around one square centimeter in size and can be applied almost like a sticker. On the underside of each patch are 100 conical microneedles made of polymer, sugar, and the vaccine. The microneedles are just a fraction of a millimeter long and dissolve within minutes after the patch is applied. The patch can then be discarded. Human clinical trials could begin in 2017 Vaccinations delivered through microneedle patches could be hugely beneficial in developing countries without sophisticated medical access. The patches eliminate the need for sanitation and disposal of hypodermic needles.

Despite being related to famous meat-eaters like the Velociraptor and the T. rex, the 3-meter-long Chilesaurus diegosuarezi was a plant eater. Armed with a horned beak, two-finger hands, and a proportionately small head and feet reminiscent of long-necked dinosaurs, Chilesaurus is the ultimate weirdo. Indeed, paleontologists think it's so odd-looking that they've taken to comparing it to the platypus — a duck-billed, beaver-tailed, egg-laying mammal. And now that they've found this curious creature, scientists are on the lookout for more.  ""I honestly think that no paleontologists expected early theropods could have ever evolved into something like this,"" says Alexander Vargas, a paleontologist at the University of Chile and a co-author of the study published in Nature today. The discovery is ""more than merely a new species — this is a fundamentally new body-plan within dinosaurs.""     Chilesaurus Credit: Gabriel Lío / Platypus credit: Klaus / Flickr    ""Chilesaurus is an evolutionary hodgepodge."" Chilesaurus was discovered by Diego Suarez, a seven-year-old boy in Chile, in 2004. He found the fossils in rocks that were deposited at the end of the Jurassic Period — about 145 million years ago — at the Toqui formation, south of the Chilean Patagonia. Because of the dinosaurs' strange combination of features, researchers originally assumed that the fossils belonged to more than one species. A more extensive analysis revealed otherwise, however. ""I think it may deserve to be called ‘the platypus of dinosaurs,' because, like the platypus, it is very old lineage with many primitive features, that nevertheless underwent great evolutionary transformations, combining traits of radically different animals,"" Vargas says. Chilesaurus stands out from the rest of the crowd because of its beak, uncurved claws, and leaf-shaped teeth. Its hips resemble that of the herbivorous dinosaurs, while its hindfeet — feet that are wide and four-toed, as opposed to slender and three-toed, like most of its carnivorous relatives — resemble those of more primitive dinosaurs. Even though Chilesaurus is related to the dominant group of carnivores at the time, it was on a strictly meat-free diet. This isn't entirely new; T. rex has other herbivorous relatives. But those species came later, and they were more closely related to birds than Chilesaurus. This means that a plant-based diet was acquired by theropods — the group of dinosaurs to which both T. rex and Chilesaurus belong — far earlier than originally thought. ""Chilesaurus is an evolutionary hodgepodge with a remarkable mixture of primitive and advanced traits,"" says Lawrence Witmer, a paleontologist at Ohio University who didn't participate in the study. ""The platypus of dinosaurs."" The fact that Chilesaurus was so unlike other dinosaurs at the time is unexpected, Witmer says. Dinosaurs that lived in Chile, Tanzania, and Wyoming all looked pretty similar at the time, ""so to find a legitimate oddball tucked away in Chile"" is unusual. It'll be exciting to see whether it is ""an isolated evolutionary one-off"" or a member of a larger, equally weird group of dinosaurs ""that may have had a more global reach,"" he says.       Credit: Gabriel Lío Overall, the work done by Vargas and his team is solid, Witmer says. But other researchers may object to the fact that most of the bones of the skull are still missing. ""We are pretty convinced that Chilesaurus is an early theropod, but other scientists may dispute that conclusion,"" Vargas says. One way to convince them will be to recover more skull materials. That's on their to-do list, he says. The researchers are also on the lookout for other, weird-looking relatives of Chilesaurus. If scientists can find fossils belonging to intermediate species — species that make the evolutionary link between between early carnivorous theropods and the highly transformed Chilesaurus — it might help them understand how Chilesaurus got to be so strange. Finding other relatives would also support the idea that the dinosaur wasn't just an evolutionary blip.

This appears to be the site's first step into the world of paid porn after years spent feasting on free (and often illicit) content. The service costs $9.99 per month, and it's currently available within both desktop and mobile browsers. Pornhub is working on Android and Roku apps for release in the near future, and it's also planning to augment the existing service with VR integration in 2016. There's nothing innovative about any part of Pornhub's proposition. Companies like FyreTV have vied for the title of ""Netflix for porn"" through both DVD rentals and VOD functionality, and there are sites within Pornhub's own Pornhub Network that offer premium subscription plans with many of the same features. Many individual studios also have their own monthly subscription services, ones that give viewers with specific interests better quality and exclusive content. This means Pornhub's plan is differentiated by scale rather than function. It's the biggest site in MindGeek's portfolio, and it can take advantage of MindGeek's studio ownership — including Brazzers, Digital Playground, and Reality Kings — to amplify the significance of its exclusivity. Pornhub's parent company is one of the biggest parties in a business where size really does matter, and it has an opportunity to exert real pressure on both competitors and existing users. No one has figured out how to make people pay for porn Of course, no amount of functionality or paywalling addresses the fleshy elephant in the room: no one has quite figured out how to make people pay for porn. Pornhub has benefitted from that basic fact in the past, and the launch of Premium feels like an attempt to have it both ways — a buffet of free views, polished off by a sweet bump in monthly subscriptions.

Unveiled at the 2015 Geneva Motor Show, the Quant F is an electric car with a difference. It draws its energy from two tanks of differently ionized liquids, relying on the chemical reaction between them to power an electric motor system capable of reaching speeds in excess of 300kmh. These so-called flow cell batteries are so critical to the operation and purpose of the Quant F that they make up the name of its maker: nanoFlowcell AG. This time last year, nanoFlowcell made one of the headlines of the Geneva Motor Show with its introduction of the Quant E, the first car to feature its unique battery technology and a promise for a bold new future ahead. Today, the Quant E has been rated as roadworthy, but it's being relegated to the status of a research vehicle. The new Quant F is the car that nanoFlowcell wants to put into production, and it's accompanied on the Geneva show floor by a concept for a mass-market Quantino, a more affordable, low-voltage version that most people should be able to afford. The benefits of the flow cell technology appear obvious: the ionic liquids can store energy at greater density than conventional batteries and the car can be refuelled in mere minutes rather than hours. The Quant F has a maximum range of 800km (497 miles) — far ahead of anything Tesla or Audi's new R8 e-tron can achieve — and can be filled back up in just 5 minutes. Provided there's a refuelling station nearby. The downside is as easily apparent as the upside, however: outside of the Liechtenstein HQ of nanoFlowcell, there's basically nowhere to go to refuel your fancy Quant F. The company claims it's easy to retrofit existing fuel stations and there could even be solutions for your home, but that would require a coordinated, multinational effort to build out infrastructure to make the car viable. I'm not sure whether to describe that as admirable ambition or quixotic bravado.  Beyond its energy storage, the Quant F is impressive for the astonishing speed it's claimed to produce, reaching 100kmh in a mere 2.8 seconds. That's faster acceleration than Ferrari's brand new 488 GTB. The Quant F is also more practical, being able to accommodate up to four people, and friendlier to modern technology with an array of functions controllable via a smartphone app. The LED lighting inside the car, for example, can be adjusted on your phone. Oh, and there's a 1.25m-wide display spanning the entire dash of the car, combining entertainment, car analytics, and the instrument panel into one. The Quantino concept presented alongside the Quant F extends the maximum range to an even more impressive 1,000km (621 miles). It uses a less potent low-voltage system and smaller 175-liter tanks, but is based on the same technology of powering four asynchronous motors — one on each wheel — and looks just as futuristic as the senior model. I want to believe in this beautiful dream of environmentally friendly, superbly fast, technologically advanced, and conveniently usable electric cars. I want to, but I can't. Even with all the financial backing and growing public awareness that Tesla's electric cars enjoy, building the recharging facilities for EVs remains an uphill struggle. Flow cell refuelling is supposed to be easier, but the world's going to need a lot of convincing before it starts converting petrol stations into ionic refuelling centers.",0.5109014436040179,0.4890985563959821,0.1605336992963059,582,4.9295532646048112,336,6.1398809523809526,0,74,"Transportation, Photo Essay, Videos"

Every gaming PC manufacturer has by now ripped off Lamborghini's violently sharp lines and exaggerated air intakes. The Lambo has become a cliché of design by virtue of how often and how widely it has been copied. And yet, seeing the real thing in its carbon fiber flesh is still a uniquely thrilling experience. Lamborghini's debutant at this year's Geneva Motor Show is the Aventador Superveloce, an even more extreme supercar to reign atop its signature bright yellow throne. The new car has gone spartan in its pursuit of speed, stripping out the infotainment system, the carpets, and some noise insulation elements. The monocoque, fixed air intakes, and the new rear wing are all made out of carbon fiber, supported by lightweight aluminum frames. The bucket seats, door panels, and fenders are also all made out of carbon. Even the exhaust system has been redesigned to be lighter, and altogether the Superveloce sheds 50kg (110lb) from the original Aventador's weight. Which is, of course, only the start for Lamborghini. The reduction in weight is accompanied by modifications to the V12 engine that see the new Aventador put out 750bhp, sending the car from 0 to 100kmh in 2.8 seconds. That's 6.66 percent faster than the new Ferrari 488's 3 seconds, another mid-engined speedster for those interested in taking their cars to the track as often as the open road. The exterior has also undergone changes that have significantly improved the Superveloce's aerodynamics and downforce relative to the ""standard"" Aventador. Both the front and the rear of the car have been redesigned, and that new rear wing plays a big part in making the latest improvements possible.  The net result of all these tweaks and alterations is a car that looks unapologetically masculine, almost belligerent. It's a Lambo with an extra shot of testosterone. Whereas Ferrari sought to balance beauty with brawn in the new 488, the Aventador Superveloce is laser-focused on achieving maximum power at a minimum weight. It's an uncompromising car, but it still looks stunning, even if its stated goal is function first, and form second. Lamborghini will start selling the Aventador Superveloce later this spring for the extremely precise price of €327,190 (just over $360,000) before taxes.

More power, more speed, more aggressive lines, and even more curves. It's a flowing, organic, aerodynamic shape that seems to have been hewn from some scarlet-red meteor landed near Maranello. It goes from 0 to 100kmh in 3 seconds flat. It has a track-ready 0.06-second response time to the accelerator. Predictable, yes. But boring? Never. Succeeding the Ferrari 458, this new car comes with a brand new 3.9-liter V8 engine, which is augmented with two turbochargers and mounted in the middle of the chassis, beneath a pretty little window. It has more power and torque than any sane human being could ever need, but Ferrari's made even bigger improvements in aerodynamics. The 488 manages the contradictory feat of increasing downforce — by a full 50 percent relative to the previous model — while decreasing drag. The result, says the Italian company, is that the 488 GTB is now the most aerodynamic road-going Ferrari ever. The 488's braking system has been derived from the outrageous LaFerrari hybrid car, improving stopping distances by 9 percent. No detail has been left neglected, with the engine also including ""an ion-sensing system which measures ionising currents to control ignition timing and adaptively predict misfires."" Even the freaking exhaust headers have been designed to improve the clarity and tonality of the car's engine noise. Seeing the Ferrari 488 in person is an experience almost worth paying for. The side windows are like teardrops suspended horizontally in the air. The wheel arches are slightly exaggerated, directing air and the observer's eye around the car's flowing, harmonious shape. The 488 has more sharp angles and lines than the 458, but still retains the look of a natural predator.

Developed by REX, an award-winning New York-based architecture firm, the concept would house ""two sister Middle Eastern media companies"" in a pair of towers. REX's brief for the towers was simple: propose two elegant structures that make reference to traditional Arabic architecture. At first glance, the dual towers certainly look attractive, but are fairly conventional in their exterior design. Each would house studios in their basements, a large common space over the first few storys, and news, broadcast, and general office facilities above. However, REX's proposal fits enormous retractable sunshades within the structures which overlap to create a 700-foot tall and wide curtain, shielding workers from direct sunlight.   These shades resemble giant parasols, 12-sided umbrellas with concave edges and a light curve to their spines. The system has been designed to reference traditional Arabic architecture on a grand scale; when interlocked, the shading structure looks like a giant example of Mashrabiya panelling, a type of intricate latticework commonly found adorning windows. The shades would be installed on both the eastern and western facades of the towers, but only one side of the buildings would be shaded at any given time. At the correct point in the day, determined by the sun's position, a 60-second transformation would see one side's shades retract while the others open.  On the towers' eastern facade, LEDs would be integrated into sunshades, which would be centrally controlled to form a giant ""television screen"" across both buildings. This screen would broadcast the companies' content to the entire city. The client for REX's bold plans remains confidential, as does the buildings' potential location and cost. The architecture firm was invited by the unknown corporations to create the new headquarters as part of a competition open to numerous firms.

But this wasn't a typical gallery opening. There were no hors d'oeuvres or cocktails, and well-heeled patrons weren't shopping for artwork to hang in their multimillion-dollar lofts. No, on this Saturday night a small Tribeca gallery was the nexus of Ghostbusters fandom. Children of the ’70s and ’80s came out in droves to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the film and peruse an incredibly eclectic collection of original fan art commissioned solely for the occasion. This is the first stop on a multi-city tour put on by Los Angeles’ Gallery1988. Over the summer, it'll make stops in LA and Chicago, before concluding in San Diego just in time for Comic-Con. And for fans looking to decorate their homes with Ghostbusters art, these shows are the only opportunity to buy prints. ""I have a lot of walls,"" a fan tells me with a chuckle. His name's Jason, and he's looking to decorate his New Jersey-based office. He and his fiancé are waiting in line around the corner from the gallery entrance. They've hardly moved in the 45 minutes they've been here, but Jason doesn't seem dismayed. ""I have a lot of white space to fill.""   Similar determination can be found up and down the line. Closer to the front door, I find friends Ed and Eugene, both accompanied by their girlfriends. Ed tells me that he grew up watching the Ghostbusters animated TV show. ""I had all the toys,"" he says. His girlfriend says the toys are still on the shelves of his apartment. His buddy Eugene pulls out his iPhone — the wallpaper is a picture of his girlfriend posing next to a guy in a Stay Puft Marshmallow Man costume. ""['Ghostbusters'] lends towards doing almost any scene."" The event's even brought out the self-proclaimed ""Original Ghosthead,"" Peter Mosen. The title's pinned to his beige jumpsuit as a badge of honor, and he drove down in his Chevy Impala fashioned as the Ecto-1 from the film. A life-size model of Slimer sits in the backseat, and Mosen assures me that he has an inflatable Stay Puft Marshmallow Man in the trunk ""just in case."" He promptly tells me the tale of his obsession with the series (he's writing an autobiography of his history with the films). It turns out he won tickets to the premiere back in 1984 and showed up at the event in a full Ghostbusters outfit before the film was even released. He made some connections at the showing, and ultimately started suiting up in costume to promote other films. He even scored a cameo in Ghostbusters II. In the meantime, he built a true replica of the Ecto-1, and he started doing Ghostbusters-themed shows. ""I was all over the place doing kids' birthday parties. Everyone had to have me."" While we're chatting, Jody Sumner (part of a separate troupe of hardcore fans who are dressed up in full regalia for the exhibit), is peppering fans with Ghostbusters trivia questions. The prize? Halloween-sized Crunch Bars. The first one (Dana Barrett's apartment number) stumps the crowd (it's 2206), but soon the questions get easier. It turns out we're just a couple of blocks away from Hook & Ladder 8, where the supposed Ghostbusters are headquartered. ""I kind of love the idea that they're still busting ghosts."" But everyone's here for the art, and soon enough the doors open. Inside is an impressive array of work from nearly 80 different artists — all of it commissioned solely for this traveling exhibit. Styles run the gambit from illustration and painting to pointillism, sculpture, and graphic design. The diversity of the pieces may have been enabled by the film itself. With such an array of imagery in the movie, it ""lends towards doing almost any scene,"" says JoKa, a hyper-pointillist whose work is featured in the exhibit. Given so many choices, he says, ""I wanted to do... not Bill Murray. I knew he was covered."" He opted for a composition of Gozer and a Terror Dog. Another artist at the opening, Scott Listfield, went an entirely different direction. His piece is, he says, ""a futuristic take on Ghostbusters. It's the 30th anniversary, I wanted to do something very contemporary with it."" His oil painting, featuring one of his iconic astronauts, takes place 30 years further into the future. ""I kind of love the idea that they're still busting ghosts."" Considering the show of support here so many years after the first film, perhaps it's not such a crazy idea. After all, if Sony gets its way, we’ll have a Ghostbusters III soon enough. Gallery1988's Ghostbusters 30th Anniversary Art Show is in New York through April 26th. It will stop in Los Angeles from May 17th to June 1st, and Chicago from June 20th to the 22nd. The show will conclude in San Diego during Comic Con. Photography by Dante D'Orazio. Lead image credit: DKNG, ""Ecto-1.""  A suitably grotesque, full-size Slimer kept the art company. 'Ghostbusters' art galore: nearly 80 artists were commissioned to create original work for Gallery1988's traveling exhibit marking the 30th anniversary of the film. The exhibit's premiere at a gallery in Lower Manhattan drew hundreds of fans looking to buy prints of the work. After leaving New York on April 26th, the show will make stops in LA, Chicago, and San Diego. The diversity of work on display speaks to the rich, unique imagery in the film.  Save for a select few prints, the only way fans can get copies of the art on display is to go in person to the exhibit. The opening caught the attention of Peter Mosen, the self-proclaimed ""Original Ghosthead"" who's worked professionally to promote the films. He even has a cameo in 'Ghostbusters II.' Mosen proudly displays a folder of magazine clippings proving his association with the franchise. His white Chevy Impala dressed up as an Ecto-1 and stuffed with 'Ghostbusters' memorabilia is certainly proof enough of his passion for the films. Fellow Ghostheads arrived at the gallery opening fully suited up with homemade proton packs and other gear. As the line to get into the gallery grew longer and longer, Jody Sumner kept fans entertained by challenging them with trivia questions. Correct answers scored a Crunch bar.

On top of invertebrates, he also makes intricate accessories, fantasy creatures and jewelry out of clockwork parts. ""My biggest influence would have to be my father and grandfather,"" Gershenson-Gates tells The Verge. ""Through them, I had found a real love for gears and industrial equipment, and I wanted to show the beauty that I saw in these parts to others."" The Georgia-born artist, who had been making skeleton-hand pendants previously, first became inspired to create mechanical bugs after encountering a house spider on the beach. It quickly dawned upon him that the techniques used to make the pendants could be re-purposed for spider legs. ""Everything just kind of fell together. After that, I began experimenting with other bugs, like dragonflies, butterflies, a mantis, and eventually a scorpion."" Gershenson-Gates generally begins each new piece with a roundabout idea of what he's hoping to accomplish. However, he also leaves room for it to ""create itself."" Because of this, Gershenson-Gates says he has seen grasshoppers morph into dinosaurs and spiders turn into gorillas. All of his pieces are completed in a single sitting. According to Gershenson-Gates, a scorpion can take anywhere between a grueling eight to 12 hours to finish. ""I can never leave something unfinished,"" he confesses. ""I'll lose sleep if something is lying around without being completed."" In addition to custom orders, Gershenson-Gates is also developing prototypes for new sculptures. He wants to give his sculptures some degree of flexibility — even though finding or creating hinges measuring just 1/16th of an inch can be challenging. ""To be stagnant and doing the same thing over and over would just kill me,"" he says. The creative force behind A Mechanical Mind says that when he thinks of success, he thinks of talking to his ten-year-old self and ""wondering what would be cool for him to be when he grows up."" ""I remember saying that I wanted to be an artist/heart surgeon, so at least he'd be pretty happy with half of that equation.  I don't want to ever let him down.""  It takes a lot of time and effort to put together one of the creations you see on Gershenson-Gates' website. Gershenson-Gates make mantises out of parts scavenged from old watches. Gershenson-Gates occasionally makes fantastical beasts straight out of his own imagination. Gershenson-Gates is looking to make his metallic sculptures more dynamic. The jellyfish that Gershenson-Gates create are nowhere near as deadly as the real things.  ""Watch parts just kind of lend themselves to insects' bodies and legs,"" Gershenson-Gates says.  ""Strangler, which is a four-armed evolution of a spiky spined imaginary creature series, is my current favorite-ever creation,"" Gershenson-Gates says.

This time, however, the war isn’t over the future of personal transportation: it’s about the 68 horse-drawn carriages that offer tourists meandering rides around Central Park.  The rides are a New York mainstay, but opponents argue that the long days on busy city streets are dangerous and inhumane. To fight this battle, activists are turning to the same weapon that was used a hundred years ago: an electric, brass-era horseless carriage. And after a year of work, the vehicle has been unveiled for the first time at the New York International Auto Show on Manhattan’s west side — just blocks from the stables that the Central Park horses call home. At first glance, the so-called “Horseless eCarriage” looks like it might belong in a kitschy Disneyland ride. But step up close, and it’s clear that this is no tacky, turn-of-the-century facade on a modern vehicle. “It’s a labor of love,” says Jason Wenig, the passionate, straight-talking Brooklyn native behind the vehicle. His Florida-based classic car restoration shop, The Creative Workshop, was commissioned to build the vehicle by NYCLASS (New Yorkers for Clean, Livable, and Safe Streets), an animal rights group that’s leading the charge against the Central Park horse-carriage industry.    Wenig’s words don’t come across as a cliche. Polished brass fittings are sprinkled across the car. The bench seats have an old-school, diamond-tufted pattern — though Wenig tells me with a hearty laugh that the upholstery is made of vinyl, not leather. There’s even a cute (if obnoxious) ""ahooga"" horn, and the dashboard’s made of wood. ""I took my favorite things from that era and combined them into the ultimate homage."" Upon an even closer look, other details stand out, like the electric charging connector, which is located just below the radiator — right where you’d expect to find the hand crank. Perhaps most impressive is the custom-made, period-authentic chassis and traditional leaf-spring suspension that really makes it look like a brass-era car. The horseless carriage might look like cars from the period, but it’s not a replica — it’s a custom-made creation designed by Wenig. ""I took my favorite things from that era and combined them into the ultimate homage,"" he tells me in a telephone interview. He borrowed bits and pieces from period touring cars made by Pierce-Arrow, Rolls Royce, and Maxwell. Once he drew up his dream car, the struggle was to turn it into a reality. That meant passing federal regulations. To make it, Wenig had to add modern touches not found on vehicles from 1909, like a windshield, electric headlamps, and seat belts. NYCLASS wanted an electric vehicle from a start, so he brought in an EV expert from Canada who could deliver a ""rock-solid, basic, straight-forward, and highly-technologically advanced"" drivetrain. The result is an electric vehicle with 100 miles of range that can last the 16-hour shifts that carriage drivers work. But this is no Tesla. Wenig is the first to admit that ""they’re in a different world."" The Horseless eCarriage can go a maximum of 30 miles per hour, and GPS sensors automatically lock it down to 5 miles per hour in Central Park. ""Basically, it’s a really, really sexy, sophisticated golf cart."" ""Basically, it’s a really, really sexy, sophisticated golf cart."" But that golf cart is rolling into what’s become a heated politicized battle ever since New York Mayor Bill de Blasio announced on the campaign trail that he’d ban horse carriages during his first week in office. NYCLASS contributed over $1.3 million to that campaign, and it put up the $450,000 for the electric carriage revealed today. Allie Feldman, a representative for the group, says that they decided to go for the vehicle after attempts to outright ban the horse-carriage industry failed because of concerns about the 150 drivers employed by the rides. So they’re taking a different approach: ""We see this as upgrading the industry … not banning the industry,"" Feldman tells The Verge. If a horse ban can pass through the City Council, NYCLASS plans to open a shop in Brooklyn or Queens to construct more of the electric carriages. They’d sell for roughly $150,000 to $200,000. De Blasio supports that plan, but as the horse ban blossomed into a national news story, the mayor figured out that passing such a law might not be so easy. He recently announced that while the ban’s been delayed, ""we expect action on it this year."" In the meantime, celebrities have hopped on board to assist in the fight, with Alec Baldwin, Miley Cyrus, and more throwing their weight behind the ban. Others, like Liam Neeson, are working to build support for the horse-carriage industry. He’s discussed the horse ban on multiple late-night talk shows, and he wrote an op-ed on the matter that was published this week in The New York Times. Opponents of the ban point out that only four horses have died in the past 30 years, and experts say that inspections ensure proper conditions for the animals. And they suspect that the horse ban is motivated not by animals’ rights, but the business that leads to so many decisions in New York City: real estate. Two of the horse stables lie on valuable plots on Manhattan’s far west side — land that’s prime for redevelopment. NYCLASS representatives have denied such claims. Whatever the result of the battle, it’s given birth to an impressive machine. The electric car might not have quite the charm of a horse and buggy, but it’s sure to get any car fanatic in a tizzy. The brass-era car is dubbed the ""Horseless eCarriage,"" and it's designed to seat the driver and eight passengers. It's not a replica — the car was custom-made and the designer borrowed much of the look from 1909 touring cars.  The horseless carriage maxes out at 30 miles per hour, and a GPS sensor automatically locks it to 5 miles per hour in Central Park. Designer Jason Wenig (seated here), says they choose the distinctive green color to highlight the ""eco-friendly"" theme of the car.  Dials and knobs allow the driver to monitor battery charge, turn on the heat, and use a PA system built into the vehicle.  The car's massive lithium ion battery pack gives it 100 miles of range and enough stamina to last a 16 hour shift. That comes at a price, however: the entire vehicle weighs 7,500 pounds. Peel back the hood, and the retro look and feel washes away. This is the thoroughly modern, 84-horsepower electric motor that drives the car. The back storage compartment is designed to hold a removable convertible top for the car, which will come in handy during foul weather. Jason Wenig designed the carriage for NYCLASS, an activist group pushing to ban the horse carriage industry in New York. Wenig is the owner of The Creative Workshop, a Florida-based independent restoration shop that built the car. As a nice touch, The Creative Workshop spun up a new name and logo just for the carriage. Mayor Bill de Blasio hopes to pass a ban on horses sometime this year, paving the way for more of these electric carriages, which would cost drivers $150,000 to $200,000 each.

Most important, thought, is its complimentary ultrasound system. Low intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS ) systems have already been found to promote bone fracture healing and can reportedly increase healing rate in non-union break by 80 percent. The next step for this design is to create a locking mechanism for the cast that protects the limb and cast itself in as effective a way as possible. Given that this is just a concept, Karasahin's team has time. But this being only the second in attractive new ways of rethinking the plaster cast means we may not be far off from seeing this in real life.",0.5325615488527595,0.4674384511472405,0.16279971563418347,219,5.0410958904109586,148,5.7094594594594597,0,0,"Design, Science, Tech, Concepts"

The entirety of Screenhero's six-person team will head to Slack as part of the acquisition, which is being made in a cash and stock deal.  Screenhero boasts nearly lag-free screen-sharing Though Screenhero doesn't offer video chat, it already has the tech for both voice chat and screen-sharing. Screenhero says that it currently offers the ""lowest latency screen-sharing on the market,"" allowing two people to control the same computer with next-to-no lag. It lets you share either everything on a computer's screen or just a single window, with each person receiving their own mouse cursor for control. It also allows voice chat to be used at the same time, so that the people sharing a screen can communicate if they aren't in the same room together. In particular, Screenhero suggests that its service is good for collaboratively writing code, but it can also be used for something as simple as lending a hand while troubleshooting. All of Screenhero's features will be rebuilt inside of Slack, at which point Screenhero itself will be discontinued. Paying Slack customers can use the Screenhero app for now, but it isn't accepting any other signups. Slack says that building these new features directly into its app — rather than offering them as a standalone service — will make for a much more efficient experience. That's obviously true at a very basic level, but Slack has always put a big focus on efficiency. Until now, it's shown that by allowing users to integrate dozens of other services into the chat room (so that you could, for instance, set Slack up to ping you when you get a new Yo). This will be the first time that Slack has added major new features into its own app, but they're ones that a good number of users should find helpful.

Those sales figures are global, but there is one part of the world that is far and away the biggest driver of Apple's growth: China. Revenue in Greater China was up 157 percent over last quarter and 70 percent year over year, more than double the acceleration seen anywhere else and more than three time the sales growth in Asia or the Americas.   Apple has a strange identity in China. iPhones are seen as a status symbol by the rising middle class, who have been snapping up the devices faster than anyone else. The company is courting that market with high-end promotions, like an Apple watch spread on the cover of Vogue China. A striking mix of excessive consumption and ethical concerns At the same time, the biggest black mark on Apple's image continues to be ongoing reports of labor abuses in the Chinese factories that make its devices. The company fired back at the BBC after it released a one-hour documentary that suggested it wasn't doing enough to improve working conditions. China's total revenue still lags behind Europe and the Americas, but analysts believe that Apple now sells more iPhones there than anywhere else in the world, and the earnings numbers released today back up that remarkable growth story. As tech investor Benedict Evans noted in this chart, the company's performance in China has defied all the critics.   To match that demand, Apple CFO Luca Maestri said on today's earnings call that the company plans to expand to 40 stores in the greater China area by 2016, up from less than 20 today.

As the value of the US dollar has risen dramatically, international earnings have taken a hit. Facebook says its revenue would have been roughly 4 percent higher excluding changes in foreign exchange rates. That's the same percentage cited yesterday by Apple. One major change that bucked the across-the-board financial increases was a major drop in the company's gross margins.

The company promised users a keyless door lock that paired with Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and NFC, allowing customers to unlock it remotely or with a simple proximity sensor. Lockitron ran its own crowdfunding campaign and managed to collect more than $2.2 million in pre-orders for around 14,000 units; it aimed to start shipping in March of 2013. The success of that campaign and press attention on the company drove another 70,000 pre-orders through its website.  Fast forward to today and Lockitron has shipped just over 11,000 units, less than 14 percent of the orders it had taken over the past two-odd years. And while this early version of the device does work, it can be a struggle to set up, has fallen short on battery life, and is missing prominent features. More than a few customers found themselves locked out after the product malfunctioned. ""Our crowdfunded backers became the unfortunate guinea pigs,"" says co-founder Cameron Robertson. In a survey sent out to customers, a question asked them to describe Lockitron in three words. ""Beta, potential, unreliable,"" read one response. ""Our crowdfunded backers became the unfortunate guinea pigs."" In August of last year the company realized it needed to start from scratch, and today Lockitron is announcing the results. It has a new manufacturing partner and a completely redesigned product, called Bolt. ""We made mistakes, we learned a lot, and now we are ready to deliver something that fulfills our ambition,"" says Robertson. The new unit is set to start shipping this March for $99, roughly one-third the cost of the original Lockitron.  Lockitron's struggles are symptomatic of challenges many young DIY hardware companies face. Crowdfunding, which seemed like the new face of innovation a couple years ago, has been humbled by the complex realities of mass production. The first big hurdle for the company, after the rush of receiving so many orders, was figuring out how to get them all built. ""We didn't know the first thing about China, about how to find a good partner — someone with domain expertise building something like a lock with 41 discreet mechanical components, most of which were custom-made,"" says Robertson. ""We didn't know the first thing about China."" The factory they settled on delivered working units, but couldn't keep pace with the promises the company had made around shipping. ""We got caught in a low-volume production trap,"" says Robertson. ""We had over 70,000 units on backorder, and they were producing a few hundred each week."" Lockitron had come out of the prestigious Y-Combinator startup program, but that certainly didn’t guarantee success — they were able to build something that worked well for a demo and could endure testing in their lab, but they didn't have the capital to really field test something with the mechanical complexity of a lock. The complexities of testing were magnified by the fact that the product was expected to work in partnership with whatever lock customers already had on their door.   The Lockitron co-founders with their original hand-built prototype. Lockitron ran its own crowdfunding campaign, but unlike Kickstarter, they couldn't charge people for orders until they shipped. ""We had $2.2 million in orders but none of that capital to work with, so we were super resource-constrained,"" says Robertson. The company used Amazon to take orders, but Amazon’s policy is not to charge until an item ships. (Kickstarter also uses Amazon, but gets the money earlier by framing its transactions as ""donations,"" not pre-orders.) Hardware products from established companies often get years of testing in the wild, using multiple prototypes, before finally being offered for sale. ""Most of what we showed off in the video worked, but under ideal circumstances,"" says Robertson. ""We tested against a fairly big lock library, but nothing like the diversity of old, discontinued, and well-worn locks out in the real world."" ""In the real world people have a crappy router."" The same ideal conditions applied to things like battery testing. ""In the real world people have a crappy router several hundred feet away with a few thick walls in between,"" says Robertson. ""The Lockitron would struggle to stay connected, and that ended up being a big drain on battery."" It was the summer of 2013 when the company started changing course. It found a new manufacturing partner, one that specialized in locks. And it created a new device that replaced customers' existing locks entirely, instead of sitting on top, ensuring if it worked in testing, it would work on your door. Lockitron actually ran a survey of customers who had received the first unit. The overwhelming advice was to trim features and ship something that ""just worked."" ""They're interested in trying out and helping new companies."" Of the 70,000 people who ordered a Lockitron, about 10,000 have canceled their orders so far. Robertson says that the company has managed to help them keep the faith by being transparent about its struggles and communicating regularly about its progress. ""Early on we started updating backers every two weeks like clockwork, and we're past 50 updates now. We send them out via email to all backers as well as post them to [our blog],"" says Robertson. ""They're early adopters, and they're interested in trying out and helping new companies that are working to create new categories of products."" Lockitron isn't taking any chances with over-promising this time. ""We are telling customers, if you pre-ordered, you can be first in line for the Bolt. But be aware that the first batch will be a sort of pilot, and that after a few months with them in the field, we will produce a version two that addresses any big issues."" Customers who backed the Lockitron may have waited a while, but Robertson says they are getting a more robust, functional, and affordable unit. ""It’s unfair to ask somebody to wait two to three years,"" he said. ""But hopefully we’re going to deliver them something of lasting value.""

Apple forecasted its revenue somewhere between $63.5 billion and $66.5 billion. Wall Street was expecting about $67.50 billion according to 40 analysts polled by Yahoo Finance.  As usual, Apple is not detailing the makeup of its iPhone sales, something analysts are expected to try and pull out of the company in an after-hours conference call later today. The larger, more expensive iPhone 6 Plus carries a larger profit margin, though consumer polls have shown it wasn’t as popular as the smaller model in many regions, including the US. One hint that it's helped though is the average sale price of iPhones, which came in at $687, up from $603 in the previous quarter. iPad sales at 21.4 million units came in just below what was expected. Apple released new models — the iPad Air 2 and iPad mini 3 — in October, meaning they were only on sale for about 7.5 weeks of the quarter. Wall Street was expecting Apple to sell about 21.5 million, down big from the 26 million it sold during the same quarter last year. That’s been part of a larger slump for the tablet, which research suggests is being replaced less often than originally believed. Apple has combated that in previous quarters by saying that there has been growth in places like Japan and other markets. Cook has also repeated the argument that the iPad’s growth should be viewed as long-term. ""I view it as a speed bump, not a huge issue. That said, we want to grow. We don’t like negative numbers on these things,"" Cook told analysts in October. ""Over the long arc of time, my own judgement is that iPad has a great future.""  The Mac continues to be a bright spot for Apple. The 5.52 million it sold this quarter was right around the 5.58 million that were expected and well above the 4.84 million it sold during the same quarter last year. Helping that was new Mac hardware like the 5K Retina Display iMac and a refresh to the Mac mini in October, as well as mid-year updates to its MacBook Pro with Retina Display. Another bright spot was Apple's sales in Greater China, which accounted for $16.14 billion of Apple's revenue. That's 157 percent higher than it was in the previous quarter, and up 70 percent from the same quarter a year ago. Apple no longer reveals its iPod sales One big change this quarter is that Apple is no longer reporting its iPod unit sales. As of this quarter, Apple now lumps them into a new ""other products"" category that also includes the Apple TV, Beats headphones, and soon the Apple Watch. That’s less of an obfuscation into the numbers and more of a cold hard reality that the iPod is no longer a sizable part of Apple’s business. iPod revenue came in at $410 million in the last quarter, making up less than 1 percent of Apple’s total revenue. That’s a long, long way down from its peak of 55.55 percent of the $5.75 billion in revenue it brought Apple during this same quarter back in 2006. For its next quarter, Apple expects to pull in revenue between $52 billion and $55 billion. That’s right in the middle of the $53.71 billion analysts expected. The big question ahead of earnings was whether this current quarter, which ends March 15th, will include any sales of the upcoming Apple Watch. Apple answered that question today, with Cook saying the company plans to begin shipping it by April. Apple Watch will require an iPhone to function, something that could bolster iPhone sales but also limit its initial audience in the same as the iPod and Mac back in 2001.",0.42425211268257823,0.5757478873174218,0.258882233613736,811,4.6411837237977807,379,5.4670184696569919,0,0,"Apple, Business, Tech"

Reporting a $189 million loss in Q4 off the back of write-offs related to shuttering its plasma TV operations, LG nonetheless accrued a $475 million profit for the full year, thanks in large part to its expanding smartphone business. LG shipped 59.1 million smartphones in 2014, which marked a 24 percent increase over the previous year and led to a total revenue of $14.3 billion. That amounts to a quarter of the company's $56 billion income in 2014, though LG warns of ""a challenging year ahead with greater competition globally."" The North American market has been a significant bright spot for LG, which saw a 78 increase in smartphone shipments over the last three months of the year relative to the same period in 2013. A series of well-built and specced devices like the G2 and its successor G3 have improved LG's reputation among smartphone buyers, and the recently unveiled G Flex 2 looks like a positive start to 2015. Beyond mobile, LG is reporting steady income from its home appliance and air-conditioning divisions, where it hopes to shake off ""the uncertainty of the global economy"" by focusing on more energy-efficient solutions (and, presumably, adding yet more doors to its fridges). The home entertainment group is the only part of LG that's still bigger than its mobile business, earning $18.3 billion in 2014, and the Korean company has reiterated its focus on the high end, saying that it's ""optimistic that the premium segment — OLED and ULTRA HD TVs — will continue to grow.""",0.5426210576450043,0.45737894235499565,0.18851133912172036,304,4.8914473684210522,189,5.8730158730158726,0,0,"Business, Mobile, Tech"

Every startup has an origin story, sometimes original but often manufactured to make a company seem more exciting. Ash Dhodapkar’s is about as mundane as they come. While on vacation he managed to lose his wallet and, with it, all his credit cards. It’s something that’s happened to many of us. But not all of us have a PhD in electrical and computer engineering, experience with hardware design, and friends who are experts in electromagnets. After figuring out what cards were missing and calling to make cancellations, he thought it would be pretty great to design something that would both consolidate his credit cards and, more importantly, lock itself down if lost.  After a year and a half of development (and with some more yet to go), the result is Swyp. It’s a super thin metal credit card with nothing more than a small front display and a pair of buttons that can become any credit card in your wallet. It also does loyalty and gift cards. That’s not a new idea — see Coin and Plastc — but Dhodapkar’s company aims to sell one that’s more durable, and in Plastc’s case, markedly less expensive. It also looks really damn cool. A late-stage prototype of the card I saw last week (but did not get a chance to try out in the wild) is the same size and thickness of most plastic credit cards, but made out of metal. The black-and-white display on the front is very easy to read and well laid out. It shows you which credit card you’ve selected along with its expiration date and security code. Eventually it will also be capable of displaying scannable barcodes for barcode-based loyalty cards, like the ones at big drugstore chains like CVS. Dhodapkar declined to discuss what technology the company’s using for the screen, mainly because it could still change ahead of when the card is released. He insists that both it and the card itself can withstand the rigors of being in a purse or wallet — meaning your butt. An earlier plastic version the company developed wore out after only a few months of testing, prompting the switch to metal. Dhodapkar also says that the buttons on the front, which are clicky in this prototype but will be touch-sensitive in the final version, are currently rated for more than a million clicks. While the front is very pretty, all the business happens on the backside with a magnetic strip that changes depending on what card you’ve selected. You import your existing credit and debit cards with a magnetic reader that will come with Swyp and attaches to your smartphone’s headphone jack. Using Swyp’s app, you add your cards one at a time, and they get transferred to the Swyp card using the dongle. That works for credit cards and magnetic loyalty cards. Over time, Dhodapkar says that Swyp can learn which card you typically use, or have been using most recently, then makes that the first one that comes up. The app will also act as a bookkeeper, letting you snap pictures of paper receipts for later. If you lose your card, an automatic lock secures it from being used when it gets more than six feet away from your phone. The lock is triggered by Bluetooth and the card’s proximity to your phone, and requires entering your custom PIN code that’s entered right on the card using its directional buttons. If you’re somewhere like a restaurant, the other option is to hold one of the directional buttons for a few seconds. This locks Swyp to just that card, and also temporarily disables the proximity lock feature, meaning your card will not be useless by the time your server makes it to their own card reader. More importantly, your card number is still obfuscated, making your credit card information more difficult to steal than a normal plastic card. The tools that keep your card from getting lost or stolen aren't too different from competitors Coin and Plastc, which are also in the stages of developing and testing and also plan to launch later this year. What is different about Swyp is the price, which will run just $49 during its pre-order phase, and $99 when it launches in the fall. That’s slightly less than Coin’s $100, and well below Plastc’s $155 pricing. The company also plans to make it available for free for the 1,000 to 5,000 beta testers who will test it in the real world. So far, Dhodapkar says that the test has been limited to just 10 people working on the project, who have been using it at grocery stores, auto part dealers, and barbershops. There are some notable hardware differences between Swyp and its two closest competitors. Swyp plans to support 25 different cards on the device itself, versus Coin’s 8 and Plastc’s 20. Things you don’t get are Plastc’s features like a touchscreen, support for chip and pin security, near field communications chip (something Dhodapkar says could eventually be incorporated), or wireless charging. However Dhodapkar says that Swyp’s rechargeable internal battery is rated to run for two years before for you need to top it up. Swyp hasn’t detailed exactly how you charge the card, and there aren’t any plugs or ports on it. Plastc, which has a similar design, plans to use wireless charging on a special pad, whereas when Coin’s battery runs out, you need a new card. The two big questions that remain for Swyp, Coin, Plastc, and any other company that may come in the future, is how attractive these cards will be over ordinary credit cards — which are reliable and don’t require batteries —and whether the advantages of electronic cards will be outdone by phone payment systems like Apple Pay and Google Wallet. Dhodapkar shrugs off the phone question saying he views phone payment systems not as potential rival, as much as a complementary technology. ""It works on a small set of terminals right now,"" he says, adding that you can’t easily store things like gift cards unless companies have built up the support for that in Passbook, and that the dongle system Swyp is using should let it work with any credit card. The more unknown question is reliability. In Coin’s case, that was a major issue with an early version we tested around New York a few months ago. It stopped scanning at card terminals after just 36 hours. That’s not something you worry about with plastic cards, which makes the idea of consolidating all of them into a single point of failure a risky proposition.  Even Dhodapkar agrees with that, at least at this stage of Swyp’s development. ""You should always have backup,"" he says. ""I don’t want to fool the world that people should throw away your wallets.""",0.6240482218781231,0.37595177812187686,0.8246287890634019,1144,4.7762237762237758,558,5.876344086021505,0,3,"Business, Tech"

Although Davis' lawyers argued that the records were inadmissable, as they were obtained without a warrant or probable cause, and thus violated his Fourth Amendment rights, the court disagreed. Instead, the court ruled, the government must only meet the standard for records obtainable under the Stored Communications Act, which requires that the government ""offers specific and articulable facts showing that there are reasonable grounds to believe"" the records ""are relevant and material to an ongoing criminal investigation."" Citing precedent from past cases, the court ruled that there was no reasonable expectation of privacy toward the records and that the records were not obtained by what constitutes a ""search"" under the law. ""To prevail on his Fourth Amendment claim, Davis must show both (1) that the application of the SCA to the facts of his case involved a 'search' within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment, and (2) that such search was unreasonable.

Veterinarians are required to approve welfare conditions at slaughterhouses and must sign off on imported meat before it can be processed.

By deciding to belong to teenage girls, One Direction decided that they didn't need to be taken seriously.  Boy bands are harmless first romantic interests, gateways to more diverse and better music, and a golden promise that there are men who don't think your every thought and feeling is silly. But what happens when one-fifth of your daydream is out the door? When Zayn Malik parted ways with the other four-fifths of One Direction in March, there were many tears to shed, many pieces to reshuffle, and no way to know for sure if the fantasy could continue unmarred. As it turns out, boy bands are fragile ecosystems, and when the plates shift, a fantasy may fall.

Harry is the new Zayn: Harry started establishing his position as the new resident brooder of One Direction before the original resident brooder had even signed off with a ""Remember when you had your own life?"" As you can see, in the video for ""Steal My Girl"" he is wearing a trench coat and really long hair, and no one is letting him be a playful scamp:   He tries very hard not to make jokes about it, but ultimately fails because he is still an adorable rascal even under all that brood. Thank God.   But in the announcement clip for ""Drag Me Down"" it looks like Harry has taken on ""the mysterious one"" duties full time. This comes as a shock considering a weirdly serious boat ride conversation in which Harry says that Niall deserves the title and Liam expresses relief that he is not a factory worker. But they also share a chuckle about that time that they almost kicked Zayn out of the band, so I guess this is actually the least prescient conversation in history.  Liam is the new Harry: Liam was recently voted the third hottest man in the world and therefore, I guess the hottest member of One Direction, by a randomly selected group of deranged social anarchists. The only thing I can think of to blame this massive coup on is his exceedingly adorable relationship with Sophia Smith. Just hanging with a couple of princesses ;) A photo posted by Liam Payne (@fakeliampayne) on Jul 4, 2015 at 7:27am PDT  Harry Styles does not have a princess in his life, which is apparently impeding our ability to see him for the grade-A prince he is. Liam is also the new Simon Cowell: Liam appears to own One Direction now, based on the vocal time that he got on ""Drag Me Down,"" his writing credits on more than half of Four, and the fact that he is apparently the only one allowed to speak in official promotional videos these days. Louis is the new ""Daddy Direction"": As you know, ""Daddy Direction,"" is the nickname that was once given to Liam due to his tendency to be bossy as hell and hate fun. But Louis literally impregnated someone recently, so. Niall is nearing death: Niall is like a puppy at a picnic that is really well-attended by people who react with genuine enthusiasm when he chases his own tail. He's been doing it for five years and it's getting less cute to us and less fun for him, and he's not really sure what's happening anymore. He's dizzy, and he wants to lie down. We've sucked everything out of him, including his physical tears:  Zayn is dead:  ",0.3941715498706477,0.6058284501293523,0.15095829008515968,680,4.5014705882352946,390,5.5743589743589741,0,6,

I'm Jamieson, I'm still your host, and I'm glad you're taking a break from following the Drake / Meek Mill beef to spend some time with me. This is a diss track-free zone! I love a fine musical spat, don't get me wrong — I just want to give some shine to some of the non-juicy tracks made available this week. There's a Spotify playlist at the end for your listening convenience, and feel free to share your own favorite cuts / compliments / complaints from this week in the comments. Let's go: Ashley Monroe, ""If Love Was Fair"":   I can't get enough of Ashley Monroe's new album, The Blade. She's a cutting and emotionally intelligent writer, and the album's sound is warm and curious without straying too far from tradition. ""If Love Was Fair"" hews closer to a golden, breezy strain of AM radio rock than pure, rootsy country, and it's heartbreaking for its frankness and resignation. Something about the sound of this song reminds me of One Direction's ""Fireproof,"" actually — we'll get to them later. Carly Rae Jepsen, ""Warm Blood"":   Bow down, readers: the queen Carly Slay Jepsen is roaring back to life. Vampire Weekend's Rostam Batmanglij co-wrote and produced ""Warm Blood,"" the latest in a series of great singles cut from Jepsen's upcoming Emotion. It doesn't sound much like that band, but it doesn't sound much like ""Call Me Maybe,"" either: it's tipsy, lusty, nocturnal, sitting on the edge of control. This is pop music for the half-remembered ride home. Disclosure ft. Sam Smith, ""Omen"":   I wrote about this one when it was released at the start of the week, and I've kept coming back to it since. I love hearing Smith operate within dance music, where he's restrained by beats and his richness is put to work complementing sleek, silvery arrangements. Less wailing over goopy pop-soul and more of this, please! There's nothing revelatory about Disclosure in 2015 — there wasn't in 2012 either — but they're ruthless in their competence. You could buy a shirt to this song, right? (That's a compliment, I swear.) Ducktails, ""Surreal Exposure"":   When he's not churning out sparkling guitar leads as a member of Real Estate, Matt Mondanile writes prim, light psych-pop and releases it with another band, Ducktails. St. Catherine is the band's fifth album, and something about it reminds me of the music that plays while you're building and buying stuff for your houses in The Sims. On ""Surreal Exposure,"" it's that secondary melody — I think it's a harpsichord? — lurking behind Mondanile's vocals and guitar line. If you're reading this, Matt, I have a favor to ask: record this in Simlish? Please? I'll wait to hear from you. (Until then, sool sool.) Duke Dumont, ""Ocean Drive"":   British producer Duke Dumont has a new EP coming out in October, Blasé Boys Club Part 1, and ""Ocean Drive"" is its first single. Dumont was a major part of the UK's great recent pop-house wave, a charge led by Disclosure singles like the one above, and he ended up nailing three straight top-two hits across 2013 and 2014. There's something different about ""Ocean Drive"": it's funkier, darker, built to have sharper edges. I think it's a great look for Dumont, and it's smart to step away from a sound that's become oversaturated. New Order, ""Restless"":   These post-punk titans are readying Music Complete, their 10th studio album and first without bassist Peter Hook, for a September release. ""Restless"" is its first single, and it's just fine — lacking the vitality and the momentum that marked every New Order song at the band's peak, sure, but solid given their recent personnel turmoil and the fact they're 35 years into their discography. If I'm still churning out half-decent weekly roundups in 2050, I hope you'll all recognize the magnitude of that accomplishment like I'm doing now (though I hope it's a passion project at that point). One Direction, ""Drag Me Down"":   I wrote a bunch about this one this morning, so I'll keep it short here. I'm having a great time pretending the boys are all singing this song to each other, trying to console each other in the wake of Zayn's departure. ""Chin up, lads! We're gonna get through this! No one's gonna drag us down! Yeah, that's the spirit!"" Cut to Zayn, smirking and listening to Justified on repeat... ooh, I'm getting chills just thinking about it. Bring on his ""Cry Me a River""! PARTYNEXTDOOR, ""Kehlani's Freestyle"":   Actually, scratch that — I hope Zayn's listening to this. PND's probably the least commercial member of the OVO stable, but he has an impeccable grasp on their house aesthetic at this point. He's thirsty to the point where it's pitiful, he's drinking and smoking enough to feel bad about it, he's torn between braggadocio and vulnerability. Drake might've blazed the trail, but PND's leaving fresh tracks. ""Who did you love that I gotta shake hands with? / Who did you love that I gotta make plans with?"" I want him to get over himself, but it sounds so good. Prince, ""Stare"":   Let's close things out with two princes — no, not ""Two Princes,"" two Princes. (I'll stop.) None of us can figure out Prince's streaming strategy, but we can agree that this new song is great: lively, lean, and self-referential without becoming cloying or too clever by half. I don't mind that Prince is leaning on past glories at this point, because he has a ton of them. And it's hard to make two finer choices for a sonic hat-tip than ""Kiss"" and ""Sexy Dancer,"" two songs I can't link because of his asinine video policy. Oh, my enigmatic purple dove! My confusing, diminutive genius! Thanks for giving us this one. Prince Royce, ""Handcuffs"":   Prince Royce is a Spanish-language superstar who rose to prominence making bachata, a sensual, guitar-driven subgenre of Latin pop. Double Vision is his first English full-length and fourth album overall, and it's been a joy to spend time with it. Royce is a skilled vocalist, gentle and agile without compromising on power or grit. There's plenty worth highlighting on the album — Pitbull and Jennifer Lopez pop up on ""Back It Up,"" and it's the best kind of effervescent summer jam — but I picked ""Handcuffs"" because it does a few difficult things well. It fuses tender, romantic crooning and libidinous, dubby club fare, and it does so without a shred of awkwardness. That's a sign of impressive craftsmanship.

http://www.theverge.com/2015/8/1/9082493/mission-impossible-rogue-nation-interview,Rogue Nation director Chris McQuarrie explains how to build a Mission: Impossible movie,13,5.7692307692307692,0.3090903123512616,0.6909096876487384,0.42561171909732765,Ross Miller,0,1,0,"August 1, 2015 11:00 am",0,-5,1,0,0,"To hear director Christopher McQuarrie describe it, production on Mission: Impossible — Rogue Nation was designed around the idea of premeditated chaos.

Does the marketing team have incredible moments for the trailer? What characters must live to see another sequel? Do we have the scenes that audiences expect, and yet still somehow have enough surprises to avoid that feeling of déjà vu? It's a balancing act that McQuarrie is refreshingly transparent about. Although he’s been a staple in the film industry for over two decades — he’s still most famously known as the writer of The Usual Suspects — Rogue Nation is only the third film he’s directed. All signs point to another successful Mission: Impossible outing: initial reviews are overwhelmingly positive (my own thoughts were slightly more subdued) and a sequel is already in the works. Perhaps that has to do with McQuarrie's willingness to embrace all parts of the system — ""My whole career changed when I stopped trying to get movies made... The only way I can describe it is you focus entirely on execution and don't worry about result."" Days before Rogue Nation's premiere, McQuarrie sat down at a small press roundtable to talk about the realities of making a modern blockbuster. Warning: numerous spoilers Let's start with THE scene, the big one, wherein Tom Cruise is literally hanging from an A400 aircraft as it takes off. It's been the lynchpin of the film's marketing campaign, but unlike Ghost Protocol's ""extreme-Tom-Cruise"" scene (scaling Dubai's Burj Khalifa), this one basically serves as an all-too-brief cold open. ""It's as integrated into the story as it is, simply as a matter of budget and time,"" explains McQuarrie. ""We had four days to shoot that sequence. If I'd had 15 days to shoot that sequence and $20 million more, that would have been the end of the movie — and the ending of the movie would have been ruined for you. You would have been waiting the whole time for that stunt, and you would have [already] seen it 500 times."" But even at its current scale, there was pressure to make that scene the climax. McQuarrie recalls one meeting in particular where an executive told him, ""You have to have the biggest stunt in the movie be part of the biggest sequence of the movie, and that needs to be at the end of the film,"" to which McQuarrie replied, ""Why? What do you care? It's going to be in the trailer [regardless]."" The last Mission: Impossible movie, Brad Bird's Ghost Protocol, ended with an offhand reference to a mysterious organization known as the Syndicate. It was never McQuarrie's intention to incorporate the Syndicate — Mission: Impossible films have largely avoided narrative arcs between films — but as the story developed, it became an inevitable connecting thread. ""In our minds, the idea of the Syndicate felt like this über evil organization that existed just to be evil, and that didn't interest me at all,"" he said. ""Then, as I started to realize who [main antagonist Solomon] Lane was and what he was after and that he was not acting on his own but was acting with a much larger network, that network needed an identity. I thought, that's what the Syndicate is. In my mind, it had a methodology and it had a philosophy. They're not evil for evil’s sake. Solomon Lane believes that what he's doing is good."" Instead, we end on antagonist Solomon Lane (Sean Harris) being trapped in a glass cube filled with smoke and shipped off to a storage facility where he (and the rest of the Syndicate, for that matter) can be used for future Mission: Impossible films. It's a relatively low-key moment, especially for an action film, and one that was devised very late in production. ""One of the reasons why the ending was so hard is we kept writing endings in which Ethan killed Lane [or] where Ilsa (Rebecca Ferguson) killed Lane and Ethan killed Vinter (Jens Hultén),"" he said. ""I was writing numerous endings, and Tom and I were inherently dissatisfied."" One of the main reasons, McQuarrie and Cruise realized late one night, was that the audience never actually sees the villain do anything particularly evil (""Yeah, he blew up the chancellor but we all know we never gave a shit about whether the chancellor lived or died in the movie""). And so Lane lived, much to the disappointment of actor Sean Harris who initially didn't want to be in the movie for fear of being locked into a franchise. ""When I finally convinced him to be in it,"" said McQuarrie, ""the first thing he said to me is, 'Promise me you'll kill me. Just don't bring me back because I don't want to be in five of these movies.' I said to Sean, 'I got bad news for you. It's not really up to you, and it isn't up to me.'"" McQuarrie smiles as he recalls one moment in particular. ""On the last night of the shoot he was like, 'Is there any way you can kill me?' I said, 'Yes, I can kill you right now. With the stroke of a pen, you're a dead man, [but] if the audience likes you, you got a twin brother you don't know about. Or a clone. Or a prequel. You're coming back whether you like it or not.'""",0.272744588407373,0.7272554115926271,0.15370350831440072,983,4.6856561546286875,516,5.862403100775194,0,8,"Culture, Entertainment, Film, Interview"

""'Seven seasons and out' has never been the conversation... The question is how much beyond seven are we going to do. [Benioff and Weiss] feel like there's two more years after six,"" Lombardo said. It's not surprising that HBO is willing to give Benioff and Weiss virtually unlimited time to bring their story home. Game of Thrones is one of the most popular shows on TV, and it drives a tremendous amount of conversation online. As long as production costs are kept in check and the show's quality is kept high enough to retain viewers, it's a no-brainer for the network to keep it alive. Benioff and Weiss have maintained that their exit plan involves seven seasons for years, but they've also introduced a little wiggle room in recent months. ""We've always said [seven seasons], but we have to talk to HBO and come to an understanding. There's a temptation to keep going with it because we're still having fun, but you don't want to ruin it by tacking on a couple of extra years,"" Benioff said in an April interview with Rolling Stone.

The triumvirate of trap. The rap triplets powered by ad libs and lean. Whatever you may think about the rambunctious rappers from Atlanta, Migos have certainly placed their stamp on the rap game. Takeoff, Quavo, and Offset have influenced countless rappers with the ""Migos Flow."" Everyone from Drake, to Kanye West, to Rick Ross have emulated their cadence, quickly making the familial group with a flurry of mixtapes and no official album one of the most important acts in hip-hop. Unabashedly more concerned with rhythm than rhymes, Migos have grown into a movement (Migos > Beatles is the most insane fight on the internet) and deservedly so. After blessing us with infectious club bangers like ""Hannah Montana"" and ""Versace"" and street / internet anthems like ""Bando"" and ""Fight Night,"" Migos are back with their debut album, Yung Rich Nation, and while not much has changed, their sound is still as infectious as ever.  After going on a two-year run of successful mixtapes, most rap acts shoot for the stars when it comes time for their major label debut albums, and often end up falling short. But Migos have exercised an admirable level of restraint on Yung Rich Nation, sticking with familiar producers like Zaytoven and Honorable C.N.O.T.E. to craft those twitch trap beats, and keeping the features to a minimum (Chris Brown and Young Thug show up on two songs). ""Memoirs"" opens the album with suspenseful keys laid over soaring synths as Migos takes us on a trip down memory lane (""Remember the time they shot up my mama house / 12 tried to make it my fault""). Migos have avoided stepping out of their comfort zone It's clear that Migos actively avoided stepping out of their comfort zone on Yung Rich Nation, and that's not a complaint. The album is more of the same Migos sound fans already love, now offered to a broader audience. Even the slight stylistic departure of ""Highway 85,"" a more or less straightforward homage to Eazy-E's ""Boyz-n-the-Hood,"" doesn't veer too far into uncharted territory. But the variation works surprisingly well, thanks to C.N.O.T.E.'s leery beat and Migos' surprisingly agile storytelling abilities. (""Mirror mirror on the wall / what would you do if police told you pull over your car? / Mirror, when do you picture the Migos falling off? / The mirror said you stupid boy, don't ask that question at all"").  Migos' current smash single is ""One Time"" and it's a lesson in ad libbing, in which the Migos have no equal. It's a classic Migos exercise — have a good time and keep the complex lyrics to a minimum. Yung Rich Nation is absent of filler — every one of the 15 tracks deserves a spot on the album, a rarity in today's single-dominated landscape. The most addictive track on the album is ""Cocaina,"" produced by Zaytoven and featuring fellow new-generation ATLien Young Thug — it's a lethal combination of Migos flow drug talk and Young Thug's woozy delivery.   Yung Rich Nation feels like the culmination of Migos Phase One. The eight mixtapes released by the group have led to an album that puts Migos' full array of talents on display. Their wavy hooks, addictive choruses, and undeniable ear for hits makes Migos the most compelling rap group around. At this point, Quavo, Takeoff, and Offset have earned the respect of their peers, the clubs, and the internet. Now we'll find out if they can parlay those early triumphs into mainstream success and build that Yung Rich Nation.",0.8740668732178238,0.12593312678217616,0.16594035615915295,605,4.8396694214876037,352,5.84375,0,0,"Culture, Entertainment, Music, Music Review"

It says that during the first half of 2015, the ratio of paying male members to active female members was 1.2 to 1 (men have to pay to send messages on the site; women can use it for free), which suggests a much more vibrant network. Ashley Madison also says that women sent 2.8 million messages during the last week alone. While that figure doesn't refute Gizmodo's analysis, you'd expect those millions of messages to represent more than a few thousand people.  Last week's activity may well be an anomaly Over the past week, Ashely Madison says it's seen ""hundreds of thousands"" of new sign ups, including almost 87,600 women. That's surprising for a few reasons, not the least of which being that hackers the other week exposed private information on the site's existing 37 million users, and you'd expect no one to trust the site after that to properly facilitate discreet affairs. There has also been some talk of Ashley Madison misrepresenting its usage and making it seem like far more women use the site than are actually present, something that it's clearly seeking to refute with today's statement. Of course, when considering the 2.8 million messages sent last week, it's worth remembering that this could be an anomaly. It isn't every week that Ashley Madison users are subject to a massive hack that very publicly exposes their presence on the site, and that could have easily driven usage. Likewise, it's possible that people signing up are doing so out of curiosity or research after the hack — perhaps even to view the profile of someone who they discovered was on it — so there's a big difference between new signups and active users.

But according to Fortune, at one point Google had an even more ambitious program in the works. The feature, designed to work inside Google Maps, would've been called Google Here and was slated to launch with some big-name partners including Starbucks. Fortune says that Here would serve up a notification ""within five seconds"" of a user entering any partner location; you can imagine many of those would be retail stores. If the user clicked on the notification, a full screen HTLM5 ""app"" experience would launch. Google Here would know when to send the notification via Google Maps and beacons placed in the stores of participating partners. Those ""apps"" would serve up things like store loyalty cards or live public transit schedules, according to the report. This strategy would've gone beyond Apple's iBeacon by making it possible to send out notifications even if an Android user didn't have a particular retailer's app installed on their phone. Instead, everything would happen inside Google Maps, which ranks as one of the company's most popular consumer products. But that significant level of access to Android consumers might've been one of the things that ultimately killed Google Here. Larry Page apparently made the call to shut down the project, backing his decision with concerns over invasiveness; being pinged by unwanted alerts could quickly prove annoying to users. Google was also uncertain about demand and whether retailers would be receptive to such a program or bother deploying the necessary beacons — even if Google provided them.

This of course leaves a lot of existing Android Wear owners that were hoping to pair the devices with an iPhone in the lurch, as Google is officially not supporting the Moto 360, LG G Watch, LG G Watch R, Samsung Gear Live, Asus ZenWatch, or Sony Smartwatch 3 on iOS.

Notifications from the iPhone show up on the Moto 360 just as you might expect, and we were also able to install third-party watch faces from Google's limited collection in the iOS app. Voice search also works — there really isn't anything we've found that works on the officially supported watches but doesn't work here.

I was there to ask Jeff Chang, the lead product manager for Wear, how he’d managed to get Android watches working with iOS and how much they could do with an iPhone. Then my first notification came in on my newly paired Huawei Watch and my carefully laid plans evaporated. “Um. Did something just happen with Sundar Pichai?” I asked. “Wait, what?” was the response. Oh, you know, he’s your new CEO now. Shall we go on with the interview? That’s how it goes with smartwatches. They’re meant to keep you from having to pull your phone out of your pocket. You’re supposed to glance at the notifications and smile inwardly, knowing that you can ignore that ping and focus on who you’re talking to. At their best, they do exactly that. At their worst, they derail a conversation. They’re also still nascent. Very few people have had to bother grappling with the idea of notifications and computers on their wrists, because not all that many people are buying smartwatches. There’s a real sense that everybody’s waiting to see how things shake out, and I don’t blame them. Smartwatches aren’t really ready for everybody yet, not the way that smartphones are. But the smartphone comparison is apt: nothing drove innovation in that space faster than healthy competition between Apple and Google. If competition is what it takes to get smartwatches ready for the mainstream, even Apple Watch users should be glad about Android Wear coming to the iPhone. That’s right: beginning today, a select set of Android Wear smartwatches (and all future watches) will work with the iPhone. The app should be rolling out worldwide soon. It’s been a long time coming — and it means that Google will be challenging the Apple Watch on its home turf. Those Android Wear watches will be both cheaper and more varied than the Apple Watch — just like Android itself. There’s an important caveat, though: when paired to an iPhone, Android Wear watches can’t do as much as the Apple Watch. Nor can they do as much as they can when paired to an Android phone. Right now, only three watches officially support the iPhone, two of which aren’t even available for purchase yet: the Huawei Watch, the Asus ZenWatch 2, and the LG Watch Urbane. Chang says that Google isn’t supporting older watches because it wants them to work right away, without software updates. ""In order to guarantee a good experience, where out of the box it will work immediately and you don't have to do any fancy footwork, that's why it has to be the newer watches,"" he says. But I suspect that the Android community will find ways around that limitation for older watches in relatively short order. Assuming you have a compatible watch, the set-up process with Android Wear on an iPhone is easy. Install the Android Wear app, pair the watch to the phone, and tap through some screens to set up some basic preferences. After that, you’re basically done — though there are some deeper watch settings you can dig into. Let’s just run down the feature set, though be warned that there are funny little details to know about with each of these bullet points. That’s quite a lot, actually, and much more than I expected Google to pull off. The problem is that there are restrictions in iOS that prevent certain things from working. It’s easy (and partially true) to rail against the locked-down nature of the iPhone, but in our conversations, everybody at Google demurred from wishing they could do more. Instead, Google just worked with the tools that Apple makes available over Bluetooth — and they turn out to be quite powerful. Chang says that ""Basically, like any other iOS developer, we work with Apple to make sure we understand and abide by their guidelines, what the policies for the apps are. That's what we're doing, and we'll continue to do that as we make updates to the app in the future."" And actually, there is apparently one restriction that Apple has backed off on: allowing apps to refer to Android in the first place. In the past, the powers-that-be in Apple’s App Store have rejected apps merely for noting they also exist on Android and even for declaring they support the Pebble smartwatch. How and why Android Wear’s app became exempt from those restrictions is another question Google declined to answer. Apple also doesn’t allow competing app stores on the iPhone, nor is it likely that third-party app makers will be able to easily bake in more advanced support for Android Wear. That means that Google doesn’t (at least for now) offer third-party watch apps for iPhone users. It also means that the selection of third-party watch faces you can get are ""curated"" by Google and probably won’t offer the same advanced features you can get when you use Android Wear with an Android phone. Even with all those limitations, Google has managed to make Android Wear feel very nearly feature-complete, at least by the standards of what most people use smartwatches for. Getting those ambient Google Now notifications is great, and I was weirdly pleased to be able to swipe away notifications on the watch and know the same was happening on the iPhone. If only Apple would make swipe-to-dismiss as easy on its phone. Like the Pebble, Android Wear only receives the notifications that you have set to appear on your lock screen. Google’s curated set of third-party watch faces probably has enough choices that you’ll find something you’ll like. Unfortunately, since it can’t do full-fledged third-party apps, many of the best Android Wear watch faces aren’t going to be available. But there are some good ones in there, including a pack from ustwo that I really like. Everything on Android Wear works thanks to the Android Wear app on the iPhone — you don’t need to install Google Search or any other Google apps to use it. Voice search on the watch works really well, though if you tap the button that opens your results on the phone, you run into a weird situation. Since it has to work with the Android Wear app, you end up in an in-app browser inside that app. It’s not terrible, just strange. By speaking to your watch, you can set Google Now reminders, open the Weather app, set timers, and more. All of it is as good or better than Siri. You can also use the watch to control your music, but you can’t search for a specific song in Apple Music the way that Siri can. The inability to communicate with other apps extends to other kinds of notifications, too. The most annoying is that you can’t reply to any incoming texts from your watch. You can reply to emails from Gmail, but everything else just shows you the incoming message. You have to pull out your phone even just to reply with a quick ""Okay."" But Android Wear does manage to offer some advanced features with Google apps. If you use Google Calendar or Gmail, you’ll get more detailed notifications than you would with the default apps from Apple. And Google cleverly auto-blocks notifications from some duplicate apps when you set them up. In fact, you can swipe on any notification on your watch to get to ""block app,"" which is a scary term for a nice feature: it stops notifications from that app from hitting your watch. Sorry, Periscope (not really). For Chang and for Google, all these nuts-and-bolts feature comparisons are beside the point. He feels that Google has nailed the basics: notifications, voice search, and Google Now cards. Based on my brief time with the watch, those all work and work really well. For the vast majority of consumers, the basics are going to be completely new. Rather than run down a checklist of features, Google hopes that consumers will be making their smartwatch decision based on other metrics. Namely, style and price. There are going to be probably half a dozen different Android Wear watches that will work with iPhones by the end of the year — if not more. Each of them looks different and, Google hopes, may appeal more to your personal style then the rounded capsule design of the Apple Watch. ""Our vision is a lot of diversity of hardware choices regardless of what phone you use,"" Chang says. ""You'll be able to get the watch you want."" We’ve already seen a mix of round and square watches, most of which can also be further customized with off-the-shelf bands. More importantly, you’ll likely be able to get a smartwatch for significantly less than the $349 asking price for the base model Apple Watch. We don’t yet know the prices for the forthcoming Huawei Watch, new Moto 360, or any of the other Android Wear watches due to arrive soon. But there’s going to be competition between those manufacturers, and that’ll drive the price down. Many Android Wear watches currently sell for as low as $149. Asking somebody who’s not even sure that they want a watch — much less a smart one — to lay down upwards of $400 on a nascent platform is tough. Asking them to give it a shot for less than half that price is a different story. It’s a story Google will no doubt be telling constantly over the course of the holiday shopping season.",0.5210240491396904,0.47897595086030964,0.15381824660491658,1610,4.777018633540373,690,5.9739130434782606,0,28,"Apple, Google, Tech, Exclusive, Hands-on, Videos"

Moto X 2014: great phone, bad camera. What was it that George W. Bush said about not being fooled a third time? After two years of fatally flawed Moto X phones, Motorola has a new X series to sell us in 2015, but this time it’s paying due attention to the camera. The Moto X Play and its premium-tier sibling, the Moto X Style, both have a 21-megapixel camera that Motorola guarantees will make its phones “best in class.” If — and that’s a huge “if” — Motorola can rectify its biggest weakness while retaining the things that make its hardware attractive, it would indeed deserve to be part of that conversation. The Moto X Play appears to have all the things that a modern smartphone requires and none of the superfluous extras. The Android software on board is barely distinguishable from Google’s stock version. Its processor, memory, and display specs are all a step down from the X Style, but the X Play actually has a larger battery and promises to last for two days on a single charge. And then there’s the price, which at £250 (roughly $385) in the UK is exactly half the cost of a new Galaxy S6. Even if you use the Moto Maker customization service and bump your expenditure up to £279, you’ll still be paying roughly half the price of an iPhone 6 or an HTC One M9. One of my all-time favorite smartphones, Google’s 2013 Nexus 5, was priced at almost the same level as the Moto X Play. That was groundbreaking at the time, but it came with two major tradeoffs, as the Nexus 5 was hampered by a mediocre camera and underwhelming battery life. Motorola’s new smartphone has been designed to address exactly those concerns, and its best case scenario looks very much like a more perfect Nexus 5: ticking more of the truly desirable boxes, and at a lower price, than anyone else. Take note: Motorola has opted not to sell the Moto X Play in the United States, but recent leaks indicate that the phone will make its way to the US under Verizon’s Droid Maxx branding, with an unsubsidized price of roughly $300. The first thing I noticed upon extracting the Moto X Play from its box was its heft. This 5.5-inch handset isn’t any heavier than similarly sized competitors like the OnePlus 2 or iPhone 6 Plus, but it’s more compact than both and thus packs its weight more densely. The big 3,630 mAh battery has a lot to do with that. Encased in a chunky, metallic (but not metal) frame, this is an unmistakably masculine device, and even the wavy texture on the back panel is more evocative of a wire fence than anything warm and cozy. There’s a roughness to the patterned back which I like, and it certainly enhances grip of the phone, though I’d have liked to see that treatment extended to the sides of the X Play as well. The smooth sides can be a little too slick to handle with assurance, making it easier to drop the handset (that will be a familiar issue to iPhone and HTC One owners). If you do drop the Moto X Play, though, there will be little reason to worry. Everything about this device seems to have been built to withstand a beating, and it feels incredibly rigid and tough. Its camera lens is also recessed slightly, rather than protruding as it is on many recent phones. The only real physical annoyance about the X Play is its loose volume rocker, which rattles when I move the phone around and feels nowhere near as nice and tactile as the ridged power button. The best way to think of the Moto X Play is that it’s essentially a smartphone with the external case built in. It’s less refined than thinner and lighter devices like Samsung’s Galaxy S6, but it already has the extra battery capacity and durability that would compel S6 owners to put a case around their device. I happily accept the size and weight tradeoff with the Moto X Play, because I can’t imagine a scenario where I wouldn’t want to have the benefit of its jumbo 3,630 mAh battery. In over a week with this phone, I’ve only had to recharge it five times. Unplugging it at midnight, I go through a full day and most of the next — the 15 percent battery warning would pop up around 6PM on day two — before I have to worry about power. Motorola’s claim of 48 hours of battery life from the Moto X Play is, in my experience, accurate. It should be noted that my daily routine is pretty forgiving on the battery, as I typically keep Bluetooth off and don’t do much 3D gaming, but I did use it extensively during my testing period, and it held up for an impressively long time. Most phones these days do a great job of consuming negligible power when their screen is off, but only one with an oversized battery like the Moto X Play's can assure you of more than a day’s endurance no matter the workload. Motorola’s other big claim, besides the battery, is that the new camera in the Moto X Play would be class-leading. At its price point, that’s probably true — as the X Play does indeed have the best camera I’ve seen in any Motorola phone to date. But there are a couple of important caveats mixed in with all the good imaging news. Let’s start with the happy side of the coin. One of the earliest photos I took with the Moto X Play was of the webcam on my MacBook Air. The detail and resolution of that shot were so good that I actually spotted the tiny laser perforations through which the webcam indicator light shines. That’s insanely impressive, revealing detail that’s barely perceptible to the naked eye. The Moto X Play also exhibits very good dynamic range, especially when shooting in brightly lit environments. Most phone cameras force you to choose between exposing your subjects correctly at the expense of a sunny day’s sky, or retaining the wispy cloud formations but making your foreground look dark. I left the X Play’s HDR mode on the automatic setting and just trusted the phone to expose images correctly. I was not let down. The process of taking photos with the Moto X Play is similarly satisfying. Motorola has refined its camera launch gesture to a double twist of the wrist, which works remarkably well. It’s reminiscent of the action of cocking a shotgun — a neat kinetic preamble to shooting things — and I actually prefer it over the standard camera shortcut on the lock screen. The camera app itself is similar to the stock Android one, and photos are taken exceedingly quickly. Trouble arises, though, when the X Play fails to focus properly, which I noticed happened quite often for me with closeup shots. The phone’s autofocus works before you’ve tapped the screen to capture an image, so Motorola is relying on it being accurate enough and simply captures what the camera sees at the moment of the tap. That can lead to frustration, but Moto has also added in the option to select your favored focus point, which comes with an exposure adjustment dial as well. It’s a simple but useful addition. My elation with the X Play’s camera was dimmed, appropriately enough, when I started using it in darker conditions. The extraordinary detail and speed that characterize this phone’s camera under bright lights are both lacking when it gets into a more challenging environment. Focus takes longer and image grain becomes apparent. The iPhone 6 focuses more reliably and exposes low-light scenes better than the X Play, which has a tendency to underexpose. This situation is not really improved by Motorola’s night mode, which appears to crank up the ISO in order to capture more light while reducing the resolution to a 3.7-megapixel image. It makes for slightly brighter photos, but that’s all. The X Play’s two-tone flash is more helpful (and it’s recreated on the front by Moto illuminating the display so that it lights up your selfies), though it too has a downside, which is the introduction of the dreaded red-eye effect. If I sound like I’m flip-flopping about this camera, that’s because I kind of am. Everything good about the X Play’s imaging depends on having the right circumstances to shoot — that’s where this camera can flat out outperform others — but the very definition of mobile photography is that you don’t have the best circumstances. Most people use their phones to capture group shots in smoky bars or their children dashing about in the playground. I wouldn’t recommend the X Play for either, as Motorola’s default shutter speed is a little too slow to capture fast-moving subjects reliably. This is where Motorola would step in and suggest the X Style’s camera for more demanding users. It comes with the same sensor, but also includes a better phase-detect autofocus system and a more powerful image signal processor that, among other things, allows for 4K video. I’m not dissatisfied with the X Play’s 1080p video; I think that’s perfectly adequate, and I like its overall camera performance, but those upgrades could tempt a few to step up into the higher price range. Ultimately, I think that’s the thing that must be kept in mind with the Moto X Play: sure, this phone’s camera has limitations, but it’s also extremely capable and close to unrivaled for its price. The other important pillar of the Moto X Play’s appeal is the near-stock Android software on board. It’s virtually untarnished by Motorola (though there’s no guarantee that your local carrier will be as restrained), with only the company’s signature additions like active display notifications, voice control, and the aforementioned camera twist layered on top. I am, unsurprisingly, a fan. What did surprise me, however, was the lack of smoothness I encountered on the Moto X Play: animations and transitions are not particularly smooth, and browsing and zooming through my photos included pauses to process the images before presenting them in their full fidelity.   I know the X Play’s Snapdragon 615 processor is capable of doing better than this, as evidenced by smartphones like Sony’s M4 Aqua that have already used the chip successfully. As weird as it is to say, given Moto’s history of close collaboration with Google and Qualcomm, it seems like Motorola hasn’t yet fully optimized its software with the X Play. The phone also exhibited a weird bug where receiving a messaging notification prompted a paused YouTube video to resume playback (in the background! YouTube isn’t even supposed to be able to do that without a Music Key subscription). The positive way to look at this is that smoother and faster operation is well within Moto’s reach with this handset, provided the company keeps working on it and updates the software regularly. I haven’t talked about the Moto X Play’s display so far because, honestly, it’s one of the most unremarkable screens I’ve come across. It’s got good viewing angles, it’s reasonably readable outdoors, and its 1080p resolution feels quite sufficient for its 5.5-inch size. But we’ve basically reached the point where every new smartphone has a good display, and so the Moto X Play’s strengths don’t stand out — they are to be expected. The screen does look a little washed out at times, and it lacks the perfect pitch blacks of previous X models with AMOLED technology (which complemented Moto’s ambient notifications nicely), but it still gets the job done. The same is true of the speakers, which are just okay.   So who, if anyone, should buy the Moto X Play? Battery life enthusiasts, first and foremost. Motorola has focused on marketing its new camera and the fun of customizing your own X Play via Moto Maker, but the thing that really makes this handset stand out is its big battery. Two days of real-world use on a single charge are valuable to anyone and everyone. Plus that massively upgraded camera helps to distinguish the X Play from Motorola’s own Moto G, which could otherwise tempt the more frugal buyer away. As things stand today, Motorola is setting up to have a very good, clearly delineated 2015 lineup: all of its smartphones aim to be cheaper (and better) than their most direct competition, but each has something a little bit unique to justify its price tier and existence. That makes buying advice pretty easy: if you like Motorola’s approach of rugged design and pristine Android software, just grab the Moto model that best fits your budget. You’re unlikely to be disappointed.",0.6515706631044791,0.3484293368955209,0.16640425072004025,2160,4.7736111111111112,960,6.3197916666666663,0,16,"Google, Mobile, Tech, Review"

While the MDMA Blackston’s been dosed with is usually more associated with raves, glow sticks, and rap lyrics, the chemical also has a second life as a medication used to heal psychological wounds.     Blackston joined the Marine Corps when he graduated from high school in 2004 — as the war in Iraq was steadily intensifying. On December 20th, 2006, during his second deployment, Blackston was in the passenger seat of a Humvee in Ramadi, acting as the machine gunner. The Humvee was struck by a rocket-propelled grenade fired by an insurgent. New armor was installed on the driver’s side of the truck, but the RPG caused a piece of metal to shoot underneath the driver’s window and through the driver’s lap. The shrapnel pierced ammo cans at Blackston’s feet and caused an explosion. ""I took shrapnel to my butt, legs, and left testicle,"" says Blackston. ""My driver was killed."" Blackston remembers he had been laughing at some joke when everything became a ""black void."" The world around him seemed to be moving in slow motion; he felt no fear at the time. ""I was really outside of myself,"" he says. The fear would come later. About six months after leaving Iraq — but while still in the military — Blackston discovered he didn’t feel like himself. He went to a military clinic in Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, where a computerized test flagged him for post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Blackston received the same treatment the majority of veterans with PTSD receive. The military doctors put him on Seroquel, an antipsychotic, and Zoloft, an antidepressant. The talk therapy he received was minimal; he says he had to wait six weeks between hour-long therapy sessions. ""There was just so much time in between that the therapy sessions were pointless, and the medication just makes you feel like a zombie,"" he says.   He finished his four years with the Marines in 2008; back home, he began studying at Trident Technical Community College in South Carolina. But the drugs made it harder to focus on his schoolwork — so he stopped taking them. He tried using marijuana and psychedelic mushrooms instead, which he describes as Band-Aids on his wounds.  He had experienced suicidal thoughts. And that was when Blackston came across a study designed to treat PTSD with MDMA. ""I was at the end of my rope. I was ready to try anything,"" he says. Before becoming a participant in the study, which was conducted by the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS), applicants have to do psychological tests to confirm they have PTSD and show that they’ve been taking prescription drugs that haven’t worked. Everything checked out for Blackston. Patients like him have three 90-minute meetings with Dr. Michael Mithoefer and his wife Annie to get them oriented, Mithoefer tells The Verge. After that, they begin the MDMA-assisted psychotherapy sessions. The patients come into the office in the morning and take their pill. The therapists stay with the patients for eight hours, during which the session focuses on discussing the experiences that caused patients’ PTSD. Each MDMA-assisted session is one month apart; the therapists and patient discuss symptoms and general mental health regularly in between sessions over the phone or in person. In the study, participants receive either low-, medium-, or full-dose MDMA — 30mg, 75mg, or 125mg, respectively. Patients who were in groups with lower doses have the option to receive three full doses one month after their second session; Mithoefer says everyone gets three full-dose sessions. Two months after the final session, an independent psychologist measures where the patient is on the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS). The test is conducted again a year later.     It’s not clear how MDMA may help patients recover from PTSD. Imaging studies of PTSD have shown increased activity in the amygdala, the fear center of the brain, and decreased activity in the prefrontal cortex and in the hippocampus. Essentially, three parts of the brain are operating irregularly, which prevents people with PTSD from processing everyday experiences normally. However, once people take MDMA, there’s increased activity in the prefrontal cortex, and decreased activity in the amygdala — it basically evens out the scale so proper therapy can be done, Mithoefer says. PTSD patients are often ""too aroused or mostly numb"" during therapy without MDMA; the drug helps therapy happen for them ""meaningfully, without being overwhelmed by the fear,"" Mithoefer says. Whatever the explanation, the results in small trials look promising. A previous study found 10 of 12 patients no longer registered PTSD on their CAPS scores after receiving MDMA-assisted psychotherapy. Mithoefer says his group hasn’t fully analyzed the results for the study Blackston participated in. He says the outcomes look similar to the first study so far; analysis will be released in May. As for Blackston, he says MDMA and therapy cured him. He did three 75mg sessions and three full dose sessions, finishing in 2012 — and no longer registers on the PTSD scale. He views the trial positively. ""I had a profound moment, I guess it felt like a bird’s-eye view of how everything went down [in Iraq] and why it happened,"" he says. ""I was a machine gunner. I was supposed to take anyone out before they take us out, and getting hit was my responsibility, and my driver dying weighed a lot on me. I had that guilt for the longest time,"" he says. In therapy, he had a moment where he finally saw the big picture. ""I saw my whole past completely differently,"" he says. ""It no longer became something that was haunting me."" Blackston says he still has normal anxieties, but he turns to making art to stay relaxed. ""I was so young to have life and death in my hands,"" he says. When he was still suffering from PTSD, he says he feared his own right hand, because that was his shooting hand. Now, he says he uses it to paint.

The findings lend new weight to longstanding concerns over the resurgence in domestic fossil fuel production, as well as the complex land use regulations that make environmental monitoring more challenging. The paper, published in the journal Science, examines the impact of oil and gas production on terrestrial plant growth, using a metric called net primary production (NPP). NPP can be used to gauge the health of the ecosystem. Using satellite data from 2000 to 2012, the authors found that oil and gas production reduced NPP by about 4.5 Tg of carbon or about 10 Tg of biomass through the loss of vegetation — the mass equivalent of 30 Empire State Buildings.  Croplands lost the equivalent of 120.2 million bushels of wheat over that period — about 13 percent of all US wheat exports in 2013 — while rangelands lost vegetation totalling more than half the public grazing lands managed by the Bureau of Land Management. Ecosystem damage may be permanent American oil and gas production have soared in recent years, and the boom isn't expected to subside anytime soon. Today's study finds that between 2000 and 2012, well pads, roads, and storage facilities built for oil and gas development occupied about 3 million hectares of land — the equivalent of three Yellowstone National Parks. As demand for biofuels and agriculture increases, the authors write, oil and gas activities may spread even further into unused rangelands. The ecological damage they've already wreaked could be permanent. ""These are semi-arid landscapes, this is not lush countryside,"" says co-author Steve Running, a professor of forest ecology at the University of Montana. ""So that land can sit there for centuries before it grows much of anything if there's not some reclamation and revegetation done.""  Landscape impacts of oil and gas development. (Chris Boyer / kestrelaerial.com) Previous studies have analyzed the environmental impacts of oil and gas drilling in the US, but most have focused on specific regions or aspects of biodiversity, such as habitat loss or water resources. The study released today takes a broader, more comprehensive approach, covering more than 2 million oil and gas wells across the US and Canada. And although others have used NPP to measure the health of ecosystems affected by fossil fuel development, experts say this study is the first to do so on such a large scale. ""NPP is as important in agricultural productivity as it is in supporting wildlife,"" says Julia Haggerty, an assistant professor of geography at Montana State University and one of the study's co-authors. Measuring biodiversity changes in terms of NPP also makes it easier to understand the trade-offs involved in oil and gas development. ""So if you're beginning to compromise that, you can begin to think in systematic ways about the trade-offs that are possible... it forces us to think on a broader scale than we typically do."" ""a wake-up call"" for policymakers The Obama administration has touted this surge in oil and gas as a driver of economic growth and an important step toward reducing US dependence on foreign oil. But there are major concerns over the fossil fuel industry's environmental impact, especially with regard to hydraulic fracturing, or fracking. This year, the White House introduced tighter regulations for fracking companies, amid widespread uncertainty about long-term effects on public health. Federal management agencies have taken steps to balance energy production with environmental concerns, but they only have jurisdiction over federal lands. As the authors note, 90 percent of US oil and gas infrastructure rests on private lands, for which environmental regulations are fragmented across state and municipal lines. The researchers hope that their findings will spur more comprehensive policy debates about the environmental trade-offs involved in energy development. ""What they've done here is unique,"" says Timothy Johnson, an associate professor of energy and the environment at Duke University, who was not involved in the study. ""I haven't seen this sort of analysis in the literature."" But he says it may be difficult to sway public opinion with statistics on vegetation declines, however dramatic they may be. ""It would help to have more of the ‘so what?'"" Johnson says. ""They still need to make that connection to grab the public."" For now, though, the authors say policymakers are their primary target. ""We see this paper as a wake-up call to our land managers and policymakers that we need to seriously regulate these industries to revegetate these areas once production is done,"" Running says.

Modern humans spread from Africa to Europe and Asia, which were already populated by older Neanderthal cultures. The two groups interbred, adding some Neanderthal DNA to our present-day genes. The relatively sophisticated humans flourished, while their Neanderthal counterparts disappeared, going extinct in Europe somewhere between 39,000 to 41,000 years ago. But the timeline, in many places, is still foggy. By identifying a pair of ancient teeth as conclusively human, a team of scientists think they've managed to clear things up a little — and helped settle a debate about how different human and Neanderthal cultures might have been. ""From 45,000 up to 40,000 [years], we have several cultures that suddenly appeared in Europe,"" says University of Bologna researcher Stefano Benazzi, co-author of a paper that appears today in Science. One of those cultures was the Protoaurignacian, which developed in southern Europe around 42,000 years ago. The Aurignacian culture that followed marked a turning point in modern humanity: among other things, it gave us the world's earliest known musical instruments, the earliest known wall art, and potentially the first representation of a human figure. Protoaurignacians themselves are known for making personal ornaments, small stone blades, and other things that are ""quite typical of modern humans."" But while their artifacts have been left behind, it's hard to conclusively prove that the Protoaurignacians actually were human. Only two teeth and a bone fragment have been found in Protoaurignacian sites In fact, only three remains have ever been recovered from known Protoaurignacian sites: a fragment of fetal bone from France and two teeth, found in different parts of northern Italy in 1976 and 1992. It was widely expected that they came from humans, Benazzi says, but they couldn't rule out the possibility that Neanderthals had managed to develop a strikingly modern culture. ""It would mean that Neanderthals had exactly the same skill as modern humans,"" says Benazzi, and could weaken the theory that humans had survived by outcompeting them. In order to test this, Benazzi and his team examined the two tooth samples. First, they checked the enamel of one against a range of newer human teeth. Neanderthal teeth have comparatively thin enamel layers, and even heavily worn down, the Protoaurignacian tooth was closer to human measurements. For the second tooth, they managed to extract mitochondrial DNA, which sits outside a cell's nucleus and is passed down only through the mother. Checked against the DNA of 54 present-day humans, 10 ancient modern humans, and 10 Neanderthals, along with another extinct species of human and a chimpanzee, it fell squarely within the modern human range.  3D models of the two teeth. (Daniele Panetta, CNR Institute of Clinical Physiology) Unfortunately, because mitochondrial DNA comes only from the mother, the team can't get a full picture of the genetics. ""From enamel thickness and the mitochondrial DNA, we cannot exclude interbreeding,"" says Benazzi. The mother of whomever owned the second tooth was human, he says, ""but if the father of this child was a Neanderthal, we don't know."" His team hopes to later extract nuclear DNA, which contains both parents' genes, but that's a more difficult proposition. Even if it turns up conclusively human, the study is limited by the fact that there are only two samples. Considering that it's taken nearly 40 years to find even these two, they can't count on having another one turn up. Based on the estimated age of the two teeth, these humans lived in southern Europe at least 41,000 years ago, around the time Neanderthals went extinct. Though it's only speculative, Benazzi believes this supports the idea that modern humans contributed to their demise, whether through direct measures or some kind of indirect competition. No matter what, he thinks they've demonstrated that the Protoaurignacian culture can be traced back to modern humans — not, at least exclusively, highly skilled Neanderthals.",0.3331846669753482,0.6668153330246518,0.8739594695610026,673,5.2838038632986626,375,6.1840000000000002,0,2,"Science, Report"

The work, carried out by researchers in China, sought to remove a gene responsible for a potentially fatal blood disorder using embryos sourced from a local fertility clinic. Although the study purposely used a type of embryo incapable of developing into a live birth, scientists have warned about the ethical implications of the work. The technique used to edit the genetic material — known as CRISPR — is potentially capable of not only removing diseases from the human genome, but also enhancing traits such as intelligence and beauty. scientists called for a global ban on editing the human genome in March Nature News notes that rumors about the work, led by Junjiu Huang of Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou, have been circulating for a while in the scientific community. Scientists responded preemptively in March, calling for a temporary worldwide ban on the use of CRISPR to edit human genes until the implications had been better examined. In an article published in the journal Science, leading biologists warned about the dangers of altering the human germline (meaning permanent changes to the egg, sperm, or embryo that can be passed on to future generations). They note that the ""enormous opportunities"" of such genetic engineering come with ""unknown risks to human health and well-being."" ""It raises the most fundamental of issues about how we are going to view our humanity in the future and whether we are going to take the dramatic step of modifying our own germline and in a sense take control of our genetic destiny, which raises enormous peril for humanity,"" George Q. Daley, a stem cell expert and member of the group behind the Science paper told The New York Times last month. Daley and his colleagues noted that although a moratorium on human gene editing might be obeyed in the US and Europe, scientists in more ""lax jurisdictions"" might be tempted to experiment regardless of the ethical and clinical problems. precise genetic engineering has been made possible by CRISPR — unveiled in 2012 Until quite recently, the prospect of creating heritable modified genes was a distant one. The theory of simply examining the genome and cutting out the genes responsible for specific diseases is straightforward enough, but researchers lacked a ""knife"" that was sharp and precise enough to carry out the work without missing their target. In 2012, such a tool arrived in the form of CRISPR — a technique that co-opts molecules used by bacteria to fight viruses, directing them to make precise cuts in genomes instead. The technique has already been used to modify genetic material in animals such as mice and monkeys, and now it is being turned to the human genome as well. scientists face both practical and ethical challenges However, as scientists warned in March, and as this recent research shows, we are still a long way from simply manufacturing babies that are more intelligent or more beautiful than their non-genetically modified peers. The study from China — published in the open access journal Protein & Cell after being rejected by Nature and Science for ethical reasons — used a total of 86 ""non-viable"" human embryos, but only 71 survived the process. Of these, only a fraction were actually found to accept the material intended to replace the genes causing the blood disorder, and even then, the genomes that were edited were a mix of changed and unchanged cells. As Carl Zimmer notes in National Geographic, there were several major problems with the work, including the fact that the CRISPR technique often missed its target, inserting the DNA into the wrong place in the genome. ""Such a misfire wouldn’t just fail to fix a disease,"" writes Zimmer. ""It could create a disease of its own."" He adds that despite this and other mistakes, there was nothing in the researchers' work that was a ""conceptual deal-breaker"" for using CRISPR to edit human genes. Future work and research will most likely improve upon the accuracy and efficiency of the technique. However, this will only lead to new and more profound difficulties.",0.4675281553656069,0.5324718446343931,0.8395548833881614,709,5.0493653032440058,379,6.1952506596306067,0,0,Science

The two genomes, separated by tens of thousands of years, helped provide genetic clues about how the mammoth species changed over its lifetime. The older genome represents a 45,000-year-old Siberian mammoth; the younger, a 4,300-year-old specimen found on an Arctic island, is believed to be among the last living mammoths, according to a study published today in Current Biology. But assembling the genomes meant collecting DNA samples from 10 different specimens, along with a separate tissue sample, an endeavor that required a dozen different researchers from Russia, Sweden, and the United States. The bulk of the samples came from Wrangel Island, an island off Russia's northeastern coast that's believed to have been home to the world's last mammoths. ""The parents of the younger mammoth were distant relatives."" The samples provide researchers with a rough guide to how the species developed over the course of the Pleistocene Epoch. The biggest finding is that as time went on, the mammoths' genes became less varied— suggesting a smaller and more inbred population. ""We were also able to see that the parents of the younger mammoth were distant relatives, which is usually the case when populations become too small in size,"" says Elle Palkopoulou, a geneticist from the Swedish Museum of Natural History. That's a common pattern for declining species, but this is the best evidence yet that it happened to the last of the mammoths. Tracking that decline required sophisticated DNA analysis. Even the most recent samples were highly degraded after thousands of years in the permafrost, so researchers compared the samples to existing genomes from African elephants. Since the African elephant genome is 99 percent similar to mammoth DNA, researchers were able to use it as a guide for assembling the damaged scraps of mammoth DNA. The result was two remarkably complete genomes. Researchers have published mammoth genomes before, starting in 2005, but this new work is more comprehensive, offering significantly more data for each position of the genome. ""Only with such a high-quality, complete genome data could we investigate population size changes through time and look for signatures of inbreeding,"" Palkopoulou says. The glut of genetic data has led many researchers to see mammoths as a good candidate for de-extinction — using recovered genetic data to create a mammoth embryo to be carried to term by an African elephant. It's an ambitious and controversial idea, which many researchers see as a long shot that could divert crucial resources from other conservation efforts. There are also more fundamental issues of whether the resulting creature would actually be a mammoth or just an elephant-mammoth hybrid that resembles a mammoth. It would also require significant biological and husbandry challenges beyond the collection of genetic data. In the meantime, the research could have real implications for preserving endangered species. Genetic diversity is a constant concern for species with a small population, but this is the first study of a species that eventually went extinct. Further studies along these lines could help determine how small a population can be before it becomes genetically unsustainable, a vital issue for modern conservationists. So even if the research doesn’t end up bringing back the mammoth, it will still be a useful tool in the fight against extinction.

The first season of The Simpsons. ""Vogue.""  It was a much different time when the Hubble Space Telescope took off aboard the space shuttle Discovery on this day in 1990. But much like how we've ditched our Umbros for Under Armour and traded our slap bracelets for Apple Watches, Hubble has come a long way since then.  The space telescope created by NASA and ESA has taught us countless things about the universe that surrounds us, and its breathtaking images have inspired a whole new generation of scientists. (And yes, they also make great computer wallpapers.) For much of Hubble's early life in space, however, it was easy to look at the project as a failure. Outlets at the time called it ""a national joke."" A tiny imperfection in the mirror meant that all of the images it took were fuzzy and out of focus, and it took five separate repair missions to get it to the excellent shape it's in today. (One of those astronauts, Mike Massimino, wrote a particularly excellent first-person account in 2013 of what it was like to repair the telescope 353 miles above Earth.) Engineers inspect Hubble's main mirror. Being the 25th anniversary, the amount of tributes on the internet to Hubble is vast. Nature spoke to more than a dozen scientists and Hubble team members to compile a wonderful oral history of the telescope. Phil Plait, who runs Slate's ""Bad Astronomer"" blog and worked on Hubble for a number of years, wrote some great explanations of some of the most famous images to come from the project. The New York Times put together a good explainer video of how the Hubble works and spoke to some astronomers about their favorite images they took with the space telescope. Lee Billings took some time at Scientific American to laud Hubble's unsung images, the ones that won't necessarily wow you but mean a great deal to the project and to our understanding of the universe. Elsewhere, Vox has a great breakdown of one of Hubble's most famous images, Discover assembled a detailed timeline, and National Geographic tells you why Hubble images appear in color (they're really photographed in black and white) and includes a must-see interactive feature that breaks down how the telescope works, piece by piece.   This image was released in honor of Hubble's 25th anniversary. The computer-simulated fly-through video is a must-watch. Hubble's days are numbered, but it's not totally clear when it will close its eye for the final time; one thing NASA is excellent at is getting extra value out of its missions. After all, the Opportunity rover, which landed on Mars in 2005, is still roaming the surface and gathering data — even though it was only supposed to last around 90 days. And the Kepler Space Telescope has been helping us find other planets in our own galaxy since 2009, even after a massive mechanical failure. If Hubble can avoid another one of those, it's likely the telescope will continue to operate well into the 2020s. One thing we do know is that the Hubble's successor, the James Webb Space Telescope, is going to be even better. It has a mirror that is six times larger than Hubble's and will be at least 100 times as powerful. The Webb telescope will peer even deeper into the night sky, bringing us closer to seeing the very first stars ever formed. That won't happen until at least 2018, however, and it's a mission that — like many — has already suffered delays and gone way over budget. And the Webb telescope is going much further out into space than Hubble, meaning there will be no chance for humans to visit it for repairs should anything go wrong. Until that gets off the ground, scientists around the world will continue to use Hubble to stare out in space and back in time as they try to figure out how — and why — we're all here. With that in mind, here is just a small collection of some of the best and most important images taken by the Hubble Space Telescope. All images courtesy of NASA and ESA. This is a 1.5 billion pixel image of our nearest neighbor in the universe: M31, otherwise known as the Andromeda galaxy. Published at the beginning of 2015, it is the biggest Hubble image ever released, and it shows a 40,000 light-year section of Andromeda that contains over 100 million stars. Be sure to check out the interactive version (click here).  Let your eyes scan the edges of this image first, because dozens of galaxies dot the background. Then look at the tiny bright center of the image — that's a galaxy known as Hercules A, the home of a supermassive black hole. The purple jets and the red plumes on either side are actually invisible to our eyes because they are made of high-energy plasma beams, subatomic particles and magnetic fields. That material — illuminated here with help from the Very Large Array radio telescope — was ejected outward by the powerful black hole, accelerated to near the speed of light. The resulting structure measures more than one million light-years wide. Hubble was instrumental in advancing our knowledge of the nature and frequency of black holes.  Since the beginning of time, stars have been created from clouds of gas and dust like we see here in this beautiful closeup image of the Lagoon Nebula. In these stellar factories, the radiation of young stars illuminate the different elements in the surrounding clouds.  Eta Carinae is one of the first interstellar objects that the Hubble Space Telescope imaged. It has also been imaged many times over the years. The first image seen here was taken in 1991, just a year after Hubble launched, and the subsequent images were taken in 1994, 1996, and 2012. We have no way of seeing our own Milky Way galaxy from the outside — it would take tens of thousands of years to reach the edge of it traveling at light speed — so we instead use Hubble to study galaxies similar to ours, like this one. Hubble has been used to find some of the most recognizable shapes in the universe, and — like with the constellations in our night sky — familiar names are given to familiar shapes. One of the best-known cases is with NGC 6543, known as the Cat's Eye Nebula.    Hubble has taken many images of the Horsehead Nebula over the years, but this most recent one (published on Hubble's 23rd anniversary) is probably the most spectacular. The infrared view finally let us peer at the clouds of gas and dust that make up the nebula in a way we never had, and it offers us a taste of the kinds of images we might get when Hubble's successor — the infrared-only James Webb Space Telescope — launches in a few years. Another example of this is IRAS 20324+4057, or ""The Caterpillar."" Set against a backdrop of amber-colored stars, this massive formation can be found in the Large Magellanic Cloud, one of the small satellite galaxies that orbits our own Milky Way. The version seen above was created with images from the 20-person team behind the Hubble Tarantula Treasury Project, which used 60 of Hubble's orbits to closely study the star formation happening deep inside the Tarantula nebula.  If this edge-on galaxy view looks at all familiar, it's because it bears a striking resemblance to the view we have of our own Milky Way galaxy when we look up at the night sky. This is actually NGC 4631, or the ""Whale Galaxy."" Galaxies may be like snowflakes — no two are the same — but the Whale Galaxy is a reminder of how uniform our universe is at the largest scales. (As an aside, if you have never seen the Milky Way shine in the night sky in person, you should check out the International Dark Sky Association or r/darksky to find out more about the best observation locations in the US.  Stars are being born 10 times faster in the massive and awe-inspiring M82, known as the Cigar Galaxy, than they are in our own Milky Way.  You can find multiple galaxies in almost any image taken with Hubble, but you're hard-pressed to find a better view than this one. Hickson Compact Group 92 is more commonly known as ""Stephan's Quintet"" because of the five prominent galaxies. While you may only see four at first glance, the lower-right ""galaxy"" is actually two galaxies in the middle of a collision. This was the first compact group of galaxies ever discovered, and was originally spotted back in the 1800s. The spider-like NGC 6537 can be found in the constellation Sagittarius, and is ""only"" 6000 light-years away from us, a relatively close distance when compared to the scale of the cosmos.  A vast mosaic of star birth, the Carina Nebula is often referred to as the ""Grand"" or ""Great"" nebula. This particular image was originally released on Hubble's 17th anniversary, and if you look really close you can find a smaller nebula known as ""the finger of God,"" so named because of its resemblance to a common expression of vulgarity. This bizarre collection of stars and gas was the first thing the Hubble after a 1999 servicing mission was needed to fix the telescope's gyroscopes.  The best photos taken with Hubble are often the most unbelievable. This twist of blue is a filament on the outskirts of The Cygnus Loop nebula (the full view of which is equally spectacular). One of Hubble's most beautifully abstract images was actually an accident. The telescope typically locks on to what are known as ""guide stars"" to keep its aim true, but in this instance the telescope appeared to lock onto a not-so trustworthy guide star — likely a binary star system. The Hubble's alignment was off, and therefore it drifted ever so slightly while the camera made its exposure, resulting in these strange, striking streaks of starlight.   The gravitational forces at play are distorting the shapes of each galaxy, and billions of years from now they will have settled together as one. The telescope has given us our best look yet at massive galactic collisions, like this one known as the Antennae Galaxies. Since galaxies contain so much empty space, the stars don't actually impact each other, but many are flung out into space because of the immense forces involved. Sometimes, however, it is just an illusion. This looks like a collision at first glance, but the two galaxies — collectively called NGC 3314 — are nearly 30 million light years apart. Filters of different colors block or allow different light to be seen. This makes it easier to understand the behavior of cosmic objects. Even though Hubble spent its first few years taking fuzzy images, we still learned a great deal about some of the most famous parts of the sky. This image, for example, gives us a close look at just one small section of the the Orion nebula, located just 1500 light-years away from us. This image might not immediately grab your attention as much as the others, but it tells perhaps the most important story about our universe. It's called the ""extreme deep field,"" named after the ""deep field"" images before it. Every so often, Hubble is pointed away from known targets to a particular and completely black patch in the sky, and scientists keep it trained on that spot for days. Slowly, it collects light from the faintest galaxies at the farthest reaches of the universe. (This video will give you a better sense of just how small a patch of the sky we're talking about here.)There are more than 5000 galaxies in this image alone, and uses 10 years of data collected for the other deep field images.  See that near perfect circle around the bright spot on the right? That's actually the light from a galaxy that's behind the massive, yellowish galaxy in the center. When galaxies align like this, massive ones in the foreground can warp the light of what's behind them. That process is called ""gravitational lensing,"" and this particular version of it is referred to as an ""Einstein ring."" In the right circumstances, gravitational lensing can actually show us a decent view of what's behind certain galaxies, essentially increasing how far Hubble can see into the past. If this galaxy looks more massive than others, that's because it is. From end to end it measures 500,000 light-years across, five times the size of our own galaxy. Its distorted shape can be attributed to the gravity of the smaller galaxy seen above it.",0.7732833823609173,0.22671661763908268,0.14870476685708175,2143,4.6938870741950538,885,6.1864406779661021,0,62,"Science, Photo Essay"

New CEO Steve Huffman announced today that Reddit has adopted an expanded content policy, proposed in July, and has banned a number of communities — including r/coontown, Reddit's notoriously hateful white supremacist community. The ban is particularly notable since Reddit has consistently avoided banning various hate communities on the grounds that, while distasteful, they did not violate the site's official rules. Reddit has been slow to address some of its most toxic communities, and last month the company's proposal for new rules appeared to protect much of the site's hate speech. Originally, the plan was to ""quarantine"" communities like r/coontown, removing them from search and preventing them from generating revenue for the company. Instead, Reddit banned that subreddit along with five other similar communities.  ""We are banning a handful of communities that exist solely to annoy."" ""Today, in addition to applying quarantines, we are banning a handful of communities that exist solely to annoy other Redditors, prevent us from improving Reddit, and generally make Reddit worse for everyone else,"" Huffman wrote. ""Our most important policy over the last 10 years has been to allow just about anything so long as it does not prevent others from enjoying Reddit for what it is: the best place online to have truly authentic conversations."" Reddit still plans to quarantine other parts of its site, but it's not clear yet which subreddits will be affected; Huffman only noted that moderators of those subreddits would receive a message. There are, however, some more details about how the system will work. Reddit says communities will be quarantined when administrators ""deem its content to be extremely offensive or upsetting to the average Redditor."" Reddit users will need to have an account with a verified email address to gain access, and will need to explicitly opt in to view them. Additionally, the site will prohibit quarantined communities from displaying custom banners. Today's bans may not go over well with the site's highly vocal user base, who protested earlier this year when several subreddits were banned for violating the site's new anti-harassment policy. At the time, interim Reddit CEO Ellen Pao became the subject of vicious attacks for the bans, which intensified when the company later fired a key staff member. In response to the firing, Reddit's most powerful moderators briefly held the site hostage — but protests haven't seemed to cause any lasting damage to the site. While the bans are a step in the right direction, it's likely that Reddit's administrators haven't made anything easier, or clearer to users. Some of the site's key rules are open to interpretation, including things like ""inciting harm."" The new content policy doesn't seem to clear any of that ambiguity up, asking users to ""keep in mind the spirit in which [the rules] were written."" It's also not clear yet if today's bans will be an exception to the rule. Last month, Huffman said that ""banning is like capital punishment,"" and he seems to still feel the same way. ""We take banning very seriously, which is why it takes so long for us to do it,"" Huffman wrote today.

That gap of familiarity is gradually being bridged, however, as carmakers embrace electric motors and produce more powerful and beautiful electric cars than ever before. There are more battery-powered headliners this year than ever, and one of them is Audi's R8 sports car, which now includes an e-tron option. Instead of the V10 petrol engine that can take the R8 to 100kmh in 3.2 seconds, the e-tron model uses only electric power to achieve a 3.9-second 0-to-100 time. That's still some pretty awesome acceleration, but the real innovation of this new electric car is in the density of its battery. Audi has almost doubled energy storage — from 49kWh on its first electric platform to the current 92kWh — and done so without requiring any extra space. Energy density has, as a result, grown from 84Wh/kg to 154Wh/kg. With a few modifications made to the electric version of the car — such as the crazy-looking wheels that appear specifically designed to minimize drag — this combines for a claimed range in excess of 450km / 279.6 miles. That's more than the Tesla Model S's reported 270 miles according to American standards, but less than the 310-mile range that the S is advertised with in Europe. In any case, Audi's new car will last for a good long while before needing a recharge, plus the German carmaker promises extremely quick charging when it's needed. Audi's R8 e-tron is far from a mass market commercial product, with the company admitting that it ""uses the electrical high-performance sports car primarily as a mobile high-tech laboratory."" Nonetheless, requests from interested buyers will be honored with a ""hand-built quality"" when the R8 e-tron becomes available to order later in the year.

Ultra-luxe touches come easy at the hands of Bentley designers, but the Speed 6 is next-level: take the gear selector, for instance, which features a solid metal ""B"" peeking out of the sides from beneath a matte-finished wooden handle. The doors — which just look like normal doors when closed — actually open up at an angle, a little like the scissor doors found on some exotics. The leather that's touching virtually every surface of the car looks like it's from bespoke cows sourced from some supernaturally serene pasture on another planet. There's quite a bit of technology here, too, which is not traditionally one of Bentley's strong suits. Circular LCDs poke out from behind the analog gauges in front of the driver, a lovely combination of old and new. (Presumably, the digital gauges would be configurable in a production version of the car.) The centerpiece, though, has to be the curved touchscreen running between the driver and passenger — curved displays are everywhere in the consumer electronics industry these days, and it was only a matter of time before they made the jump to automotive. Everything about the Speed 6 seems production-ready — there are a few things like the ultra-ornate headlamps and the subtle ""6"" behind the front grille that might not make it to a real car, but it's certainly well beyond the vaporware stage. Indeed, Bentley is taking a very nudge-nudge, wink-wink attitude with the car: although it's technically a concept, company officials are very clear about the fact that it could foreshadow a production model. As with many concept cars, the company is probably using Geneva as a litmus test to gauge just how many well-heeled automobile enthusiasts start drooling at the Speed 6's sight.

The burgundy Grand Sport Vitesse “La Finale,"" chassis number 450, sits directly opposite the red-and-blue Veyron number one. The differences between the two cars, separated by a decade of development and refinement, appear minor. That's because of a deliberate effort from Bugatti to design the last Veyron as a homage to the original car. One thing the two bookend Veyrons will certainly share is the added appeal of being the ones that started and finished this wild Bugatti adventure. The last Veyron has already been sold to a customer from the Middle East, and though its price hasn't been disclosed, the average selling price of the most recent Veyrons has been just over $2.5 million. All 450 cars — 300 coupes and 150 open-tops — have already been sold, so any future collectors will have to pry one away from the hands of the high-net-worth individuals currently possessing them.

Oh, and the very last Bugatti Veyron was shown here after a ten-year run. Here are some of the highlights. There's a great irony about the Geneva Motor Show. It's full of super expensive, scarcely attainable cars, but just getting there is enough to bankrupt you (now that the Swiss franc has shot up in value).

You don't have to be a gearhead to appreciate the beauty and timeless elegance of Italian car design. Whether it's Alfa Romeo, Ferrari, Maserati, Lamborghini, or even Fiat with its diminutive 500, there's a flair and a flamboyance to this nation's vehicles that is rarely surpassed by others. This year's Geneva Motor Show kept up that legacy with the official introduction of two mid-engine supercars from the two racing heavyweights. In the red corner is Ferrari's 488 GTB, a smooth, curvaceous... You'd think triangles and hexagons would be tired by now. Every gaming PC manufacturer has by now ripped off Lamborghini's violently sharp lines and exaggerated air intakes. The Lambo has become a cliché of design by virtue of how often and how widely it has been copied. And yet, seeing the real thing in its carbon fiber flesh is still a uniquely thrilling experience. Unveiled at the 2015 Geneva Motor Show, the Quant F is an electric car with a difference. It draws its energy from two tanks of differently ionized liquids, relying on the chemical reaction between them to power an electric motor system capable of reaching speeds in excess of 300kmh. These so-called flow cell batteries are so critical to the operation and purpose of the Quant F that they make up the name of its maker: nanoFlowcell AG. The Ferrari 488 GTB is predictable. More power, more speed, more aggressive lines, and even more curves. It's a flowing, organic, aerodynamic shape that seems to have been hewn from some scarlet-red meteor landed near Maranello. It goes from 0 to 100kmh in 3 seconds flat. It has a track-ready 0.06-second response time to the accelerator. Predictable, yes. But boring? Never. Apart from fashion, I'm not sure that there's any industry that's as insatiably hungry for newness than the automotive world. It's a devastatingly design-focused business, endlessly devouring itself in the name of creating something unique, something you haven't seen before. Even the notoriously iterative smartphone market is cut more slack: Apple can effortlessly get away with slapping an ""S"" on an iPhone's name and using the body for another year. Cars are different.

A South Korean couple has built a cafe that looks like a classic Rolleiflex twin-lens camera, and they would love to hear your story as you sip down a cup of coffee. Park Sung-hwan dreamed of becoming a military pilot ever since he was a boy in elementary school. When he informed his family of this ambition, they told him that serving in the armed forces wasn't worth pursuing. Park persevered, joining the army in 2000 and eventually becoming a helicopter pilot. But now he has another, more unusual passion; the Dreamy Camera Cafe that he runs with his wife Kwak Myung-hee, herself a retired army pilot, in Yangpyeong county — about 40 miles outside of Seoul. ""In Korea, it's likely that you'll face a problem in realizing and shaping your own path,"" said Park. ""My wife and I wanted to build a place where anyone could share their stories and help out those who are struggling to discover or achieve their dreams. The idea for a camera-themed cafe came later.""   The Rolleiflex 2.8F camera that inspired the cafe's design. Park first got into photography 12 years ago and his interest in collecting cameras naturally progressed over the years. The couple initially pictured a building shaped like a Leica rangefinder, but subsequently opted for a Rolleiflex design due to technical challenges. In 2009, Kwak sketched a concept for the cafe on a piece of cardboard. It was just a matter of time until the pair could turn their dream into a reality. ""We sent out a picture of the Rolleiflex to several contractors and two companies replied back saying they could build it,"" said Kwak. Construction began in 2012 and the cafe finally opened last year. ""We were excited to learn other people's dreams, and hopefully inspire them to execute their plans by sharing our experience of planning the cafe."" Influenced by several Korean artists who create visualizations of people's dreams, the couple realized that their love for photography could play an integral role in achieving their goal. The cafe's current method of visualization is as simple as taking a photo of visitors, printing it out on instant film, and encouraging them to record their dreams in a few words on the picture's border. Kwak and her husband are both committed to the ""dream visualization"" route they've taken — Park takes a photography class after work, and they are actively looking for new ways to motivate the customers to join the movement while managing the day-to-day operations. But they admit that the majority of customers were only interested in the camera theme. ""Roughly 10 percent understand our intention and openly share their stories. We would be thrilled if more people could see the cafe the way we see it — a space for dreamers,"" said Kwak. ""We occasionally worry that we've done something wrong whenever someone stays for 30 minutes or less just for a quick look at the cameras or a quick drink of coffee. It's not meant to function like an average cafe."" After a picture of the cafe went viral, the couple found themselves in an unfamiliar situation. Their Facebook page went from 150 to more than 3,000 likes within two weeks, and they were bombarded with messages from multinational news sites. The couple said they were surprised, but added that they're not making a big deal out of the attention — they have already turned down local TV networks' requests for interviews. The cafe owners made it clear that they weren't after money or fame. ""The recent spike in interest is only temporary. Besides, the number of Facebook likes probably represents the number of people who would like to visit, but can't in reality,"" said Park. ""Our success isn't defined by how much money we make. If someone walks through the door and talks about their dream, that would make our day. That's what the Dreamy Camera Cafe is for."" Sam Byford contributed to this report. The cafe is two stories high and 30 feet tall. A customer looks at the cameras the owner has collected over the years. The Kodak Retina I, from 1948, is one of the vintage cameras on display. “We made each little interior design decision by ourselves,"" says Kwak. ""I’m pleased with the outcome.” On each table is a set of color pencils, a menu inside a photo album, and a film roll-style paper towel dispenser.

The floating barge first captures the trash in a large net, before it's then sucked inside and processed and separated by type of plastic. It's just a concept right now, but Dyson is hopeful that it could be turned into a useful tool for keeping waters clean. It may not be designed for oceans, but by sifting through rivers it could help reduce the amount of plastic that's fed into our oceans to create problems like the Great Pacific garbage patch.

That could soon be a reality if Volvo's new concept rear-facing child restraint makes it into production. The Swedish carmaker's concept seat has a built-in pump that can inflate it in just 40 seconds, and deflated, the whole package is about 18 x 20 x 8 inches (45 x 50 x 20cm) — portable enough to fit into some luggage or a large bag. It weighs just over 11 pounds (5kg). This isn't the first time that a manufacturer has experimented with inflatables for a car seat, but this appears to be the first rear-facing inflatable child seat. Some others on the market are booster seats, which are designed for older children and use the car's built-in seatbelts. Volvo's rear-facing seat concept has a five-point harness and it's designed for children up to three years old. To offer that kind of restraint, Volvo's using drop-stitch fabric, which is employed in applications such as inflatable boats. To boot, it's an attractive seat that looks like it'd be at home in a leather-clad Scandinavian vehicle. Unfortunately, Volvo isn't offering any more details about the concept, like whether it plans to bring it into production, but at least it shows that there is a better way.

The collection includes illustrations of autumnal gardens and Christmas scenes, but it's Laaksonen's three drawings — with their trademark musclebound men and leather — that are most eye-catching. According to Itella Posti, the stamps embody the ""confident and proud homoeroticism"" that lies at the heart of Laaksonen's work.

An excerpt from Samsung's Design Philosophy. Despite Samsung's smartphones often being accused of showing a lack of imagination, Samsung Electronics as a whole frequently surprises with bold designs, and in particular its large-screen TVs are clearly crafted by very talented individuals. A series of galleries and videos highlights some of Samsung's finer moments, along with popular products like the Galaxy S4. In the near future, Samsung will use the site to host the ""design stories"" behind its new Galaxy S5 smartphone and Gear Fit smartwatch. The timing is no coincidence The timing of Samsung's new design site is unlikely to be coincidental. The company is currently arguing that it didn't copy Apple's work in a court case worth billions, and has also recently released perhaps its most important product of the year, the Galaxy S5, to less-than-enthusiastic reviews. As Samsung expands its Gear line of wearables, it'll need to shake its current reputation as a money-oriented purveyor of everything.

It’s a mess. And of all the incompatibility hells we deal with on a daily basis, the sad state of audio affairs can be particularly tragic: nothing kills a party faster than 60 seconds of awkward silence. All it takes is one would-be DJ with a Galaxy Note trying to connect through an Apple TV to crush the vibe.  Gramofon wants to solve that. The plastic box, no bigger than a few ice cubes, is a Wi-Fi router that has built-in support for music services (beginning with Spotify at launch, and more to come) and connects to a sound system over a standard 3.5-mm jack. It's made by Fon with help from serial entrepreneur Amol Sarva, perhaps best known for creating Peek, a one-trick pony of a wireless device that did email (that’s it) and offered an unusual lifetime service plan. Fon, meanwhile, boasts that it offers the largest footprint of Wi-Fi hotspots in the world by selling cheap, special routers to individuals that expose a sliver of bandwidth to the public in exchange for access to Fon’s global network.   It’s not that there’s a shortage of products that can stream music, of course; even a cursory visit to a local Best Buy will uncover shelf after shelf of wireless speakers. But stereo Bluetooth, the standard used by the overwhelming majority of them, is a low-fidelity compromise that has limited functionality and poor range. ""Your friends can’t control it. You go to the bathroom or get a phone call, the whole thing breaks,"" Sarva notes. ""Your friends can’t control it. You go to the bathroom or get a phone call, the whole thing breaks.""  Then there’s Wi-Fi, most notably AirPlay. In fact, Gramofon is roughly the size of an AirPort Express — but the AirPort's problem is that compatibility stops when you leave Apple’s front door. Gramofon works with both custom apps and Spotify on Android and iOS, and anyone who is connected to the Gramofon network can add songs to the queue or control the current song using their mobile device. Whoever owns the Gramofon can sync it with their Facebook account, after which Facebook friends can connect without a password. And because it pulls media directly from the cloud to the device — much like Google’s Chromecast — the music won’t stop if your mobile device wanders out of range or you receive a call. ""We want to make music social again,"" Sarva says. It’s certainly not the first time music has been ""social"" (remember iTunes DJ?), but at $30 to $60 for the first batch of orders, it might just be the cheapest and the most compatible. Facebook friends can connect without a passwordGramofon faces varied competition — everything from AirPlay, to set-top boxes that support music apps like Roku and Fire TV, to the lauded Sonos system, to music-focused gadgets new and old. There’s Beep, which is still in preorder and bills itself as a Sonos-style multiroom music synchronization system, but so far it only offers your own music library plus Pandora. It’s also an idea Google played with on the short-lived Nexus Q. Fon and Sarva are banking on Gramofon’s impressive price combined with the fact that it grants users access to Fon’s Wi-Fi network to set it apart. The device can function as a full-fledged Wi-Fi router, too, which is a nice bonus. Could Gramofon become the Roku of streaming music? Maybe — its makers claim they’ll be adding support for a wide variety of other services including SoundCloud, Google Play Music, Rdio, and Pandora, making it the cheapest way to turn any speaker into an all-purpose cloud player. The caveat, of course, is that these are still just promises: right now, Gramofon is an unfunded Kickstarter that hopes to send out its first units this July.",0.6172736289550735,0.38272637104492646,0.8493421667765748,693,4.8398268398268396,400,5.8425000000000002,0,0,"Design, Home, Tech, Report"

The studio, known for Shrek and the Madagascar series, has struggled at the box office in recent years despite finally finding some critical success with How to Train Your Dragon. Continued box office misses have put DreamWorks Animation in a tough place. Twice this year, other companies have considered buying it, though neither purchase — from SoftBank or Hasbro — panned out.  ""Great films, better box office results, and growing profitability"" ""The number one priority for DreamWorks Animation’s core film business is to deliver consistent creative and financial success,"" Jeffrey Katzenberg, CEO of DreamWorks Animation, says in a letter to investors. ""I am confident that this strategic plan will deliver great films, better box office results, and growing profitability across our complementary businesses."" DreamWorks previously laid off 350 employees after a big loss at the end of 2012. This year, it's fluctuated between mild profits and big losses. In part, that's been because of original films failing to live up to its expectations. The studio's current schedule may resolve that, with plans to release one sequel and one original film each year. Sequels typically perform well and often do quite a bit better than the original film they're based on, so this is a logical — if staid — strategy for DreamWorks Animation to take up. It just means the studio will have to ensure that some of its originals are good enough to keep building on. The studio's 500 layoffs will come from ""all locations and all divisions"" of the company. However, Variety editor Marc Graser says that this will include the closure of the studio's location in Northern California, where How to Train Your Dragon came out of. Staff from that location will have the option of moving south to DreamWorks Animations' main campus, but it's likely to mean that the studio will lose some of the artists responsible for its best work in the process. That's bad news given that Dragon has been the force behind DreamWorks Animation's recent acclaim — but, on the other hand, that hasn't done enough to help the studio out monetarily, which is ultimately what matters.",0.6275778021401166,0.3724221978598834,0.7850850174323464,387,5.054263565891473,243,5.7325102880658436,0,0,"Business, Culture, Entertainment"

Uber was valued at $40 billion this past December when it raised $1.2 billion in venture capital. The folks backing this loan believe it will be worth many times that at its inevitable IPO.

To that end, it's announcing the formal launch of what it's calling the Creatrs Network, a curated group of artists who excel on Tumblr and can help brands make ads that people actually like. Tumblr says that it's been running tests with this network for the past year and has already used it to run successful campaigns with Axe, Gap, and Olay, among others.  If ads look good, people may even share them Rather than running ads that look like they could be plastered up on a billboard, Tumblr is hoping that brands will tap its network to find someone who actually knows what works on Tumblr. That's probably going to be GIFs, but it's also going to be GIFs that are composed in a way that they feel like something you'd want to share. Tumblr really wants the ads to fit in as though they were any of piece of art — it even says that artists will receive credit and links back to their page (in addition to actual payment for their work). Tumblr is working with hundreds of artists as part of the Network. It also has a far smaller group, simply called Creatrs, who work on Tumblr-specific events like GIFing major events. So far there's no way for artists to apply to be part of either network — right now, Tumblr is just finding them — but that may change as it grows more mature. Even though the network is only being made public today, Tumblr says that it's already paid out around $250,000 to its Creatrs. This may just be the start of Tumblr's work with artists on its platform. David Hayes, Tubmlr's head of creative strategy, suggested that over the next year we'll see more products roll out that are meant to give creators more power. In particular, he spoke to the number of Tumblr blogs that have turned into books, suggesting that Tumblr may be able to do more to enable that transition. Ads may be one of the less-exciting places to start, but it's also one of the most important for Tumblr. That's how it makes money, but with ugly, intrusive ads, it would end up driving users away.

During an interview at the TechCrunch Disrupt conference, Wheeler discussed what have arguably been the two biggest issues facing the FCC this year, and its two biggest victories. Wheeler has already said that letting Comcast merge with Time Warner Cable would have posed an ""unacceptable risk"" to competition, and at Disrupt, he made it even clearer that the companies wouldn't have had an easy time getting past regulators. ""I think it was a pretty responsible decision by [Comcast CEO] Brian Roberts"" to drop the plan, says Wheeler.

""You're talking about something very personal to people.""The Comcast debate might be over, but the FCC's fight to protect its net neutrality rules is still going. Wheeler calls his policies, which were approved earlier this year, ""the most stringent and expansive open internet rules in history."" (For reference, open internet rules have been around for roughly 10 years.) It's also, based on the record 3.7 million public comments, the most heavily scrutinized decision in history. ""That’s why this decision was so damn important,"" he says, whether those comments were for or against the net neutrality rules. ""I think that the bulk of the comments indicated how when you’re talking about the internet, you’re talking about something very personal to people. And they then used that personal medium of theirs to express themselves. That was what was significant."" Like many people, he's unsurprised by the lawsuits that broadband trade groups and companies like AT&T have filed. Wheeler noted that the FCC is facing two distinct battles. First, opponents will ask the court to delay the rules while their lawsuits are considered; right now, they're set to take effect June 12th. ""I’m confident that we’ll do well in that situation for a multitude of reasons,"" says Wheeler; among other things, companies will have to argue that the rules would cause harm and be unlikely to stand up in court. ""I think we’ll be good there."" As for the merits of the case itself, Wheeler says that the FCC has solved the classification problem that sunk its last rules. ""That issue’s gone. That was the big issue last time,"" he says. ""So I feel pretty confident on the outcome of the court cases."" Does Wheeler have a strategy if the rules don't stand up? ""Not to lose.

Under the new system, a nine-person committee will oversee the surveillance operations, which are led by the prime minister, but the committee only has the power to advise the prime minister, not to overrule him. As a result, many privacy groups say surveillance power will be dangerously centralized in the wake of the new law. In 2013, Le Monde reported on a number of similar programs, described as akin to the NSA's PRISM program. The systems reportedly collected bulk telephone metadata along with private traffic from Google, Microsoft, and others. Officials denied any illegal or improper activity, saying, ""French citizens are not subject to massive and permanent spying outside of all control."" France is not a member of the US-led Five Eyes intelligence-sharing group, and the Snowden leaks turned up little evidence of the country collaborating with US or UK intelligence-gathering efforts. Still, the new bill shows a number of tactics that seem cribbed from the NSA, including bulk collection of internet metadata, which would allow the government to track French citizens from site to site. Prime Minister Manuel Valls has denied the similarities — stating plainly, ""This is not a French Patriot Act,"" but privacy groups disagree, saying the bill would give too much power to the intelligence services. ""Suddenly, you're in a system where the government has full power, full control over intelligence services,"" the non-profit group Privacy International told The Verge in April. ""If we learn anything from history it's that giving full power to governments on surveilling citizens is really not a good idea.""",0.4881848100630484,0.5118151899369516,0.8482065864676128,305,5.3114754098360653,199,6.2361809045226133,0,0,"US & World, National Security"

The most obvious restriction is simple: Internet.org gets to manage and approve apps, akin to the Apple App Store. If you want to build an app that reaches Internet.org users, you'll have build it according to Facebook's rules, utilizing as little data as possible and staying away from bandwidth-intensive services like VOIP. But some of the new platform rules go far beyond the previous net neutrality concerns, including technical measures that rule out encryption like HTTPS for users connecting over the web. Unfortunately for users, the HTTPS issues seem to be baked into the core of how Internet.org is designed. The service works as a proxy, directly managing all traffic to and from the user. According to the developer guidelines, the proxy is designed ""to create a standard traffic flow so that operators can properly identify and zero rate your service"" — but it also gives Internet.org a clear view of all the traffic on the network. Low-bandwidth services like Twitter routinely require HTTPS as a way to secure the connection between the user and the service, but that security would be impossible under Internet.org's current web proxy setup, creating real concerns for banking or private messaging apps.  An Internet.org graphic describing the proxy setup Reached for comment by The Verge, Facebook said Internet.org would address the problem through an HTTPS-enabled Android app, to be released in June. ""Starting with the Android app, we are working to support the type of encrypted services that we know people want with the right protections in place,"" a company representative said. ""We’re also investigating ways that we could provide the same security for web-based access to Internet.org, but currently we don’t have a solution that avoids 'man-in-the-middle' techniques."" ""We are dependent on existing browsers."" In the meantime, web access to Internet.org will represent a real problem for secure services attempting to take root on the service. Any web-based traffic to Internet.org will be visible not just to the Internet.org proxy but to all the intermediaries between Internet.org and the remote server, a necessity of the current proxy setup. ""We are dependent on existing browsers on people’s phones that are not aware of the Internet.org proxy,"" the representative said. Beyond security concerns, the platform continues to draw fire from net neutrality advocates in India, with MediaNama describing it as ""a fundamental, permanent change in the way the internet works."" In response, Mark Zuckerberg has insisted that neutrality principles could coexist with a zero-rated platform.

According to the report, the Justice Department is in the midst of a full review of how law enforcement agencies use the devices, and may be about to reveal significant details about how and where the devices are typically deployed. For more than a decade, Stingrays have been shrouded in intense secrecy, and criminal prosecutions are often abandoned rather risking having to admit in court that the devices were used. Stingrays are typically used to locate a specific phone in a crowd, sometimes even from a plane flying overhead, although they can also be configured to pull more comprehensive data from the phone. The system works by impersonating a 2G cell tower, which doesn't require any authentication to connect to a phone. As long as the Stingray is the strongest signal in the area, phones will automatically connect to the device, giving away their location and basic identification data. Since no larger network data can be received through that connection, the devices often result in significant service disruptions in the areas where they are used. Stingrays are also notable for how far they've reached into the law enforcement world. A number of Justice Department agencies are known to have access to the devices, including the US Marshals, but the signal interceptors are also increasingly common in local law enforcement. The EFF has compiled legal evidence of Stingray use by local departments in Baltimore, Sarasota, and Tacoma, and it's likely there are many more departments that simply haven't referred to their devices in court.

And for the people who live in the hillside village, the proximity makes their situation all the more frustrating. Though the villagers are just a short drive from their country’s seat of power, nobody from the government has contacted them about receiving aid, and it’s been more than a week since Nepal suffered a magnitude 7.8 earthquake responsible for the deaths of at least 7,200 people. A lot of press has been generated in the past few days by the inability of Nepal’s government to deliver earthquake relief to the country’s remote regions, but a visit to some of the rural areas less than an hour’s drive from Kathmandu shows that those living in the city’s backyard haven’t fared much better. In visits to places like Nagarjun and Chobhar, which is about 7 kilometers southwest of Kathmandu, I found that people aren’t putting much stock in government promises of assistance or international aid. It’s barely been a week since many of these individuals saw their homes damaged or destroyed or loved ones killed, and already they’re scavenging for building materials, laying down brick, and seeking loans.   Bai Lal Maharjan, in black, surveys the bricks he and has family salvaged from his home, which buckled during Nepal's earthquake. (Greg Sandoval) ""We haven’t seen anyone [from the government], and we really don’t expect to,"" said Radme Shyam Lama, 46, a businessman who lives in Nagarjun. ""We hope they help us with money, but we must act as if we are on our own."" Many Nepalese must now labor under unthinkable circumstances. The impact from the loss of life can’t be overstated: on one block in Chobar, for example, 10 people lost their lives, including a 12-year-old girl. Whatever else happens to Nepal in coming days, some of the people here will provide the world with a lesson in resilience. ""We haven’t seen anyone [from the government], and we really don’t expect to."" They have little choice but to move fast, says Lama. The monsoon season starts in less than a month, and the flimsy tents that many Nepalese are living under won’t protect them from the heavy rains, he said. Lama’s family want out of the tents as soon as possible and have set to work building more stable temporary shelters, using corrugated tin and bamboo poles stripped from irreparable structures. On Friday, Lama also put his nephew and another man to work repairing his parents' home. Lama has repaired septic tanks and water-filtration systems in the area, skills he also put to use in 2005 working for companies providing support to US troops in Iraq. The same day, some of the women from the village anxiously accompanied a representative from an Italian non-governmental organization, which focuses on supporting Nepal’s schools, as he assessed damage to a local campus. The women are hoping to get the school reopened soon. The same sort of activity could be found in Chobar on Saturday. Bai Lal Maharjan, 59, had already made plans to build a new home using salvaged bricks from the house he lived in for decades, which collapsed around him as he stood safely in a doorway during the quake. On Saturday, he and his family were crouched near a waist-high pile of bricks using hammers and chisels to chip off old cement. They tossed the broken and cracked bricks away. While watching Bai Lal work, it was hard to fathom that just a few days before, he watched as his younger brother’s lifeless body was pulled from the rubble of his home. The same goes for Bishnu Maharjan, a relative of Bai Lal who lived nearby. Bishnu, 31, is the father of the 12-year-old girl who died. A week after her death, Bishnu could barely discuss the girl as he tried to clean up some of the debris at his home and quickly find suitable shelter for his wife and son. In a few weeks, he is due to leave for Kuwait for his job as a security guard. Bishnu is among the more than 4 million people from Nepal, mostly men, who leave to work abroad every year, according to the Overseas Development Institute, a think tank focused on humanitarian issues.  ""We were living in bombs,"" said one resident of a village near Kathmandu where 10 people lost their lives. (Greg Sandoval) That’s just one of the challenges some people face here when trying to patch their lives. All the people I spoke with who say they planned on applying for a bank loan acknowledge that obtaining one is typically very difficult in Nepal. And even if they do, interests rates are high. What’s more, people like Lama are still paying off loans for their now-destroyed houses. ""We’re back in huts. This is natural. This is the natural way of things."" Few people in Nepal appear to have even heard of homeowner’s insurance — there just isn’t that kind of of safety net available here to most Nepalis. The good news is that the government has promised to compensate the family members of those who died, but the government has a terrible record of making good on these kinds of death benefits, according to reports. Nevermind the money, says Koman Singh Lama (no relation to Radme), who is from Kavre. He said, while attending the cremation of an 83-year-old neighbor killed in the temblor, that he and his village would be happy if someone from the government just returned his calls. He said they have made ""countless"" requests for tents but have yet to receive a response. Said Radme Shyam Lama, the businessman from Nagarjun: ""We started out in huts and then moved to bigger, more modern homes. We’re back in huts. This is natural. This is the natural way of things.""",0.38411134559763915,0.6158886544023608,0.8613062550386493,979,4.7957099080694583,514,5.9513618677042803,0,4,"US & World, Report"

By then, we’d watched him binge on drugs, alcohol, and self-loathing. He burned bridges and all but ended his career. But at least he could finally admit his failings, right? No answer came, and no answer would come by season’s end. Series creator Raphael Bob-Waksberg would probably tell you that’s the point. There are no easy answers, just the hard work of living life from day to day. So BoJack enters the second season bent on trying to be a good horse (or at the very least a better one), and it’s literally an uphill battle. In a world inhabited by talking animals living in Hollywood, things certainly lean toward the zany. Dogs hosting game shows! Owls voiced by Lisa Kudrow! But at the show’s core, there’s a heartfelt and often arresting meditation on depression and self-improvement that Bob-Waksberg and his team have married to the silliness, making the show unlike any other cartoon on TV. BoJack Horseman just got renewed for a third season, so it’s reasonable to assume Bob-Waksberg will keep injecting his particular brand of comedy into the show for next year. That’s the kind of writer and person he is — someone who loves juxtaposing the bleak with the bright and hopeful. We spoke this week about the show, his inspiration for it, and where things can go from here. Kwame Opam: By now BoJack Horseman has gone through a long spate of depression and, as of this season, a barely successful self-improvement arc. Why does the show end up being so unrelentingly dark? Raphael Bob-Waksberg: Oh, is it unrelenting? I wasn't trying to be so unrelenting about it! I think it relents occasionally. I think to me, I wanted to tell a [story] that I felt was honest, and I think a lot of shows that I see are not honest about sadness. I wanted to talk about it, and how hard it is to not be sad for some people. So I think the best way to do that was a wacky cartoon starring a talking horse. I'm really interested in this idea of the very dark and the very wacky kind of rubbing up against each other. And that contrast to me feels very fresh and interesting. I really like the idea of going to really wacky places but also to really dark places and kind of pushing on both sides of ""What is the spectrum that this show can be?"" I think we've found so far that it's a very wide spectrum, and I'm looking forward to pushing the edges of that further in the next season and hopefully beyond. BoJack digs pretty deeply into Hollywood personalities and the ruts that people get themselves into. What was the inspiration specifically into getting into this kind of material? Well, I think the beginning inspiration of the show came from, when I was living in Hollywood, in Laurel Canyon, in a house not that different from BoJack's. I was staying with like friends of friends of friends in this super fancy house. I had like a tiny half-bedroom off to the side, and I [had just] moved to Los Angeles, and I didn't know anybody, and I remember looking out over Hollywood and feeling simultaneously on top of the world, but also never more alone or isolated. And that contrast was really interesting to me. So the first kernel of the idea came from the story of a guy who's had every opportunity imaginable, but still can't find a way to be happy, and what is that about for him? And I think one of the realizations he comes to at the end of the first season is ""I haven't been good to the people in my life, and maybe that's the reason I'm not happy."" So, a big part of season two was him trying to change his ways — ""Can I be a better person, and is that going to lead me to feeling better about myself?"" And the answer to that question is very complicated. And it took us 12 episodes to dive into. Are some of these darker places places you’ve been to before? I can say, for the record, that I've never attempted to sleep with the daughter of an old flame of mine from 30 years ago. That was created out of whole cloth for the characters on our show. But I think the outlook is something that I can relate to. It's that general feeling of ""I don't belong here."" I don't know if it's completely universal, but I hope that's a little more universal than just me. One of the ways I would describe his character when I first was pitching my show is he's someone who looks around at everyone at a party and simultaneously feels smarter and stupider then everybody there. He thinks he's the best person in the room, but he also thinks he's the worst. And that idea that ""I am smarter then all these people, so why can't I figure out a way to be happy like them?"" was one I was always very interested in exploring. In my most misanthropic, narcissistic moments, how I would look around a room of people and feel that way about myself. What goes into making these complex and often damaged characters funny? You often go from very human (for lack of a better word) moments like the interplay between BoJack and Diane to bits with ridiculous characters like Vincent Adultman. I think a lot of it is what was going to be fun for us to watch. And as writers, sometimes that's ""Let's go really real with this moment and play it really real,"" and sometimes it’s ""let's see how wacky we can go with this Todd subplot"". And it's just a matter of feeling it out on our own. But we're always interested in getting to the truth. And we're interested in story first and characters first — I guess we can't be interested in both those things first, but they're kind of related — and comedy second. My thought was that I'm going to assemble a room of very funny comedy writers, and we're not gonna talk about jokes as much. We’re going to talk about story, and I'm thinking that in the writing it'll be funny, because we've worked those muscles. We know how to be funny, we know how to punch up a script, we know how to add jokes. But I'm not interested in being funny for the sake of funny. We're not just making jokes so that we can make jokes. I'm more interested in what are the characters going through. Ultimately it seems like the overall message of this season is life is about hard work. There are no lessons, no happy ending to be had necessarily. Well, I don't believe in endings. I think you can fall in love and get married and you can have a wonderful wedding, but then you still have to wake up the next morning and you're still you. Like, you can have the worst day of your life, but then the next day won't be the worst day of your life. And I think it works in a positive and a negative, that all these things that happen are moments in time. And that because of the narrative we've experienced, we've kind of internalized this idea that we're working toward some great ending, and that if we put all our ducks in a row we'll be rewarded, and everything will finally make sense. But the answer is that everything doesn't make sense, at least as far as I’ve found. Maybe you'll interview someone else today who's like ""I've figured it out, here's the answer!"" But I don't know the answer, and so I think it would be disingenuous to tell our audience ""Here's the answer!"" It's a struggle, and we're all trying to figure it out, and these characters are trying to figure it out for themselves. Do you think some people are better equipped at finding moment-to-moment happiness? Are people like Todd and Mr. Peanutbutter just better at being happy? Yeah, I think some people have different temperaments and some people are, their base level is happier than anyone else. But Todd also has moments of sadness, and so does Mr. Peanutbutter. These moments of darkness. And they are struggling like anybody else, and that perhaps part of their struggles are a little easier in certain ways but maybe harder in other ways. Do you get frustrated with narratives that tend toward ""Ross and Rachel get together"" neatness? Are you railing against shows like Friends? I love Friends! Friends is a great show! I'm not going to take a stand against Friends! One thing that I found — and it was a struggle for me as a writer for awhile — [was] I can only write the kinds of shows that I write or tell the kinds of stories that I tell, and that I couldn't do Friends. I think it's wonderful that Marta Kauffman and her team could for so many years, but I've tried to write other kinds of things and I always end up writing the things that I write. I've tried to write things that were my [version of] It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia, that were really acerbic and didn't have any feelings and was all about people being assholes. But then I couldn't help but like get some sentimentality in there, and I think that's kind of landed on my style, and this is the kind of show that I want to make. I think BoJack is really the purest expression of the stories that I am interested in exploring as a writer and as a viewer, but to me it's not a rebuke against other shows at all. This season felt bigger than last season, with each character dealing with their own arcs and, as a result, their own hardships. Will upcoming seasons expand even more? I don't know. I can't predict it, but my answer is probably no. I think we have our tight, five [character] ensemble and that's who the show is about, and one of the joys of season two was making more room for an amazing cast. And yeah, season one was all about BoJack's story and all the other characters kind of served to help him tell his story. Season two I was like ""Let's give everybody a story,"" and sometimes those stories will interact with each other, but sometimes they won't. And that felt pretty good. I think we're going to keep exploring more ways to do that in season three, but I'm not making The Simpsons here. I'm not interested in going for 25 seasons and just expanding outwards and outwards and outwards. I want to tell our characters’ stories, and I don't want that to diffuse to the point where you can't keep track of anything anymore. I'm a very big fan of our Sloth Lawyer and our Pig Doctor and all the people who work at Vincent Adultman's Business Factory, but I don't want to sacrifice the time of our main characters to focus on them.",0.4592519398980548,0.5407480601019452,0.14211902826845355,1937,4.449664429530201,730,5.9301369863013695,0,8,"Culture, Entertainment, Interview, TV"

It's also the band's first bit of new material after Four, the album they released last November. The single is arriving two days after Malik announced that he had signed a solo deal with RCA, one that will give him the opportunity to show you who he really is. ""Drag Me Down"" is a slight departure from the music the band was making with Malik in tow, which tended toward power-pop and classic rock on their later records. There's a bit of The Police in the loping, reggae-lite bass line and guitar riffs, and the song's structure is cribbed from the last few years' finest EDM-pop crossovers. This might be the closest a One Direction song comes to having a ""drop."" When you fold in the melody, the whole package reminds me of Taylor Swift's ""I Knew You Were Trouble,"" and that qualifies as praise in this space.   Malik's departure from the band has come with its fair share of Twitter tomfoolery and acrimony, most of it involving British producer Naughty Boy. He tweeted pictures with Malik and leaked demos of their work together just weeks after he broke off from the band. This raised the ire of current 1D member Louis Tomlinson, who dissed Naughty Boy until Malik felt compelled to directly respond: @Louis_Tomlinson remember when you had a life and stopped making bitchy comments about mine ? Malik and Naughty Boy's tentative alliance didn't last long, either. Within a few months, Malik was denouncing the producer thanks to another set of leaked solo material. @NaughtyBoyMusic you fat joke stop pretending we're friends no one knows you .

Beats of No Nation is about a boy in West Africa who's forced to become a child solider, and this first trailer shows just what a gut-wrenching look the film is taking at that gruesome world. Idris Elba stars and Cary Fukunaga, of True Detective season one fame, directs. It'll be on Netflix starting October 16th.   Here's a first look at the documentary that has Apple pretty upset. Steve Jobs: The Man in the Machine focuses at Jobs' role as a hero figure and how he was often anything but. It's supposed to be a powerful look at the man behind Apple, and that's no surprise given that this documentary comes from the director of Going Clear, the documentary that shook Scientology earlier this year. The Man in the Machine comes out September 4th.   I don't even know where to start with this. The Night Before is the latest ludicrous manchild comedy from Seth Rogen and crew, this time with Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Anthony Mackie as his costars. It seems like the exact type of loud, crude, and energetic comedy that people love to see from Rogen's movies, so you should already know whether you're going to be into this or not. (For me, this trailer is basically just a reminder of how powerful Kanye's ""Runaway"" is.) The film comes out on November 25th.   The 33 is a dramatization of the mine collapse that buried 33 people deep underground in Chile back in 2010. It should be no surprise that the film is shot as one seriously inspirational story, and it's certainly one that people are going to be interested in seeing. It heads to theaters on November 13th.   This looks totally haunting and insane. Room is about a woman and her son who've been locked up in a shed for years — seemingly for the son's entire life — and their eventual escape. Watch the trailer. It's some wonderful filmmaking. The movie comes out widely in the US on November 6th.

I really can't imagine what the final picture looks like, but I'll definitely watch another trailer. We Are Your Friends comes out August 28th.   I don't have the slightest idea what to make of this trailer. But if you like weird things and comedians, maybe you should watch it. It's out November 13th   The Young and Prodigious T.S. Spivet seems to have popped out of nowhere and is landing in US theaters today, which doesn't suggest there's much studio confidence behind it. But hey, it's the second English-language film from Amélie director Jean-Pierre Jeunet, and it's a children's story with all of the whimsical attitude you'd expect from him.     Steven Soderbergh's early 1900s medical drama is coming back for a second season, and it appears to be moving to... San Francisco? This first teaser doesn't make it entirely clear what we're in store for, but we're interested to see what Soderbergh is doing next — he's once again directing the entire 10-episode run. The new season starts October 16th.   I don't like this trailer because it plays like the most confused music video ever made, rather than like, I dunno, a trailer for a sweet gangster film. Still, every peek at Johnny Depp explains why people are going to want to see this movie: even though it's easy to get sick of Depp, transformative roles like this remind you why he can be so great to watch. The film comes out September 18th. HBO seems to really be digging the fake sports documentary. Ferrell Takes the Field is its second this summer, and it appears to be about Will Ferrell having a bizarre career in baseball.

Crack had found its way to the inner city and burrowed itself there, as did the gang violence that followed it. President Ronald Reagan was leading a belligerent and misguided charge in the War on Drugs. The Los Angeles Police Department made up for recent budget and staff cuts with near-constant aggression in predominantly black neighborhoods like Compton. The department even had a special unit known as CRASH, which stood for Community Resources Against Street Hoodlums (really) that encouraged police to use widespread force to combat gang violence in the city. One of the unit’s missions was known as Operation Hammer, a no-tolerance approach that really just meant arrest everyone. Police drove tanks with battering rams through the streets, crashing into homes they suspected were dope houses. The cops were quite literally destroying the city.    This is the world N.W.A was born out of, and this is where Straight Outta Compton — named after N.W.A’s seminal debut album — begins. Given its historical context, as well as our current cultural climate, Straight Outta Compton could’ve played it completely straight. The story, like so many music biopics before it, has already been written. But in the case of N.W.A, parts of it are still being written to this day. N.W.A was the product of two big cultural shifts: one of music (funk and pop paved the way for the birth of hip-hop) and one of politics (exhaustion from police brutality that ultimately led to the 1992 LA riots). The movie doesn’t let us rest on either element for very long, juxtaposing the two at a dizzying pace. Scenes of N.W.A’s small recording triumphs are bookended by scenes of piggish white cops roughing up the members for the crime of standing too long in one place. Director F. Gary Gray favors up-close shots that move quickly in a way that’s both intimate and disorienting. Scenes of bloody skulls at the hands of police move sharply to lazy low-riders and glitzy clubs in a way that’s both menacing and winking: Hey, just making sure you’re paying attention. The movie’s Compton backdrop gives it a heavy atmosphere, but one in which levity can still be found, and when its jokes land — which is often — relief rushes in with the laughter. The relatively unknown cast rises to the incredible challenge of portraying some of the most recognizable people in the music industry. As Eazy-E, Jason Mitchell is by turns thick-headed, cunning, kind, infuriating, and fragile. Corey Hawkins plays Dr. Dre with an easy intelligence that would’ve made him look like an undoubtable force even if we didn’t already know the man he would turn out to be  (He cries twice during the movie; so did I). O’Shea Jackson Jr. (Ice Cube's real life son, who looks almost exactly like his dad on screen) plays Cube with a humanity that makes him seem both familiar and untouchable. Even Paul Giamatti, who plays N.W.A’s nerdy and possibly evil manager Jerry Heller, is sufficiently cringey. Straight Outta Compton shows us how N.W.A protected themselves from a frequently hostile world by creating their own self-contained ecosystem. But it also lets us inside that ecosystem, turning biographical facts into genuinely affecting dramatic moments. Every N.W.A fan already knows that Eazy-E didn’t know how to rap at first. He was a drug dealer who had the money to help Dre launch Ruthless Records. It’s also common knowledge that Ice Cube originally wrote ""Boyz-N-The-Hood"" for a New York rap group to perform, but when the New Yorkers didn’t understand the West Coast slang, Dre asked E to rap it. But despite what we already know, there’s something completely new about actually seeing Eazy-E in the studio, sunglasses on, fumbling his way through his first verse. He can’t stay on the beat; he sounds like an audio book narrator. So when we finally hear the recorded version of the song, the transition is miraculous. Before, ""Boyz-N-The-Hood"" was just a good song. In Straight Outta Compton, it becomes a song that solidifies the intimacy of E and Dre’s friendship. It took nine hours to record, line by line. That’s the best part about music movies. If they’re done right, they make fans feel a little more connected to musicians they grew up with, or wish they grew up with. They tell old stories in ways that seem new. And they shamelessly play to their built-in audience in a way that almost always works. Raucous N.W.A concerts in front of wild crowds are catnip for superfans; the soundtrack lines up lazy boom-bap and funk against N.W.A’s gangsta rap to near-perfect effect (except for the risk of the people sitting next to you in the theater singing along). Small moments — a billboard for The Chronic, a Bone Thugs N Harmony cassette tape — help build the story of  N.W.A’s empire, a formidable but ultimately unstable structure. Here’s the thing about the story of N.W.A: it’s long. It’s not just about Eazy-E, Ice Cube, Dr. Dre, MC Ren, and DJ Yella; N.W.A’s strong, willowy tentacles have an impressive reach, intersecting  with Suge Knight’s story, with Snoop Dogg’s story, with Tupac’s story. There are so many musical beginnings linked to N.W.A that even just six degrees of separation would’ve made this movie 12 hours long. As it stands, it’s two and a half hours long. And it does feel that long. The edit room balance seems off at times: the Rodney King beating and trial gets a mere two half-scenes, but several meaningless fights and one too-long chase scene were left in. If 2015 needed a movie about one musical group, it’s N.W.A Still, if 2015 needed a movie about one musical group, it’s N.W.A. In their time, they were the biggest hip-hop group in the world, and they managed to say what millions of kids in inner cities wished they could. Their music predicted what would happen if nothing was done about the tension between underserved communities and a too-aggressive police force. And those predictions are still coming true, which says a lot about N.W.A’s foresight, but not a lot about how much we listened. Straight Outta Compton opens in US theaters on August 14th, 2015.

The first week of September marks a revival in activity among electronics manufacturers, as they vie to position their new products for the back-to-school shopping season and the winter holidays beyond it. And the place where that annual contest begins is the IFA trade show in Berlin. IFA is Europe's biggest exhibition of new consumer electronics, and it's previously served as the launch platform for major new devices like Samsung's Galaxy Note series. But this will be the first year in a long time where Samsung won't be taking over the show with a new Note, leaving room for others to grab the limelight — so what can we expect to be the highlights of IFA 2015?  Just because the 2015 Note is already out and available doesn't mean that Samsung will cede its IFA crown without a fight. At the same August event where Samsung launched its new phablets for this year, it teased the launch of its next smartwatch, the Gear S2. The software and specs are still a mystery, but it looks mighty promising already. Like last year's IFA debutant, the Gear S, the S2 will probably be running Samsung's Tizen OS, though unlike its bulky predecessor, the new watch's emphasis appears to be on a sleeker, more refined look. Because, as every electronics manufacturer likes to remind us, watches are as much jewelry as they are utility items.    Announced at Computex and promised for this fall, the ZenWatch 2 is likely to finally receive its price and release date at IFA. It embodies exactly the same philosophy as Samsung is pursuing: fashion and aesthetics first, technology second. Asus was already on this path with the original ZenWatch, and now it's expanding the options on offer with up to 18 different combinations of color, materials, and design. The Taiwanese company promises ""dramatically improved"" recharging times with a new magnetic connector, and it's also layering on a few extra watch faces atop the standard Android Wear interface. Asus wouldn't dream of coming to a big trade show with just one new product, though, and we can probably look forward to updates to the company's laptop, hybrid, and tablet lines, especially now that Intel's Skylake processor is making its way into the market.   The other near-certainty in terms of big smartwatch news is Motorola's expected launch of a new Moto 360 at IFA. Leaked images have been flooding in from a variety of sources this month, revealing a subtly updated look that nevertheless retains the ""flat tyre"" black bar at the bottom of the circular watch. The side button looks to have shifted up to the 2 o'clock position, and indications are that — like the Asus ZenWatch 2 and the Apple Watch — this year's Moto 360 will come in two different sizes. The biggest upgrade we can expect in Moto's smartwatch will likely be to its chipset, which was outdated even when the watch was first introduced and has been lagging behind the Android Wear crowd. Catching up with the internal hardware while expanding the variety of exterior options should set Motorola up in a good position to compete in the increasingly competitive smartwatch market.   Sony is one of the few companies left that still makes IFA its showpiece event for launching new phones. Having spent the first half of this year struggling to decide whether to call its new phone the Xperia Z3+ or Xperia Z4, it's now wiping away all the confusion with a new handset expected to be called the Xperia Z5. Well, technically, it's a new family of handsets, as recent leaks have revealed a 5.5-inch Z5 Premium model that would likely join the Z5 and Z5 Compact. Knowing how good last year's Z3 phones were, this certainly sounds like a formidable new set of smartphones, but Sony's biggest achievement this year might be to actually find a serious distribution channel for them in the United States. There's absolutely no reason why Sony should keep making such excellent smartphones that are not available in the US. There's been an unusual silence around Sony's other product ranges, so maybe this is one year that we won't get a new SmartWatch model at IFA. Still, the Japanese company has a growing range of wearable devices and an expanding set of 4K cameras and TVs, all of which could do with an update for the holiday season.   LG is spending this year's IFA fleshing out its OLED TV offerings and adding more audio gear, both for the home and on the move. The company's focus will be on evangelizing the benefits of HDR (high dynamic range) content, with its TV and monitor chief claiming that ""Anyone who sees our newest TVs at this year’s IFA will walk away without a shred of doubt that HDR and OLED complement each other perfectly."" In keeping with the trend of turning smartwatches and smartphones into jewelry items, LG's new Bluetooth speakers are also going for more colorful and fashionable designs, including a strap to let you casually toss your wireless speaker over one shoulder like a handbag. A new generation of G Pads is the only significant move expected from LG in terms of new Android devices. The Korean company typically avoids launching new phones at IFA, and the lack of any smartwatch leaks suggests it will also be a quiet show for its wearable gear. There may be an iterative update to its Android Wear range, but the most notable wearable is likely to be this new pair of neck buds. The one thing we can't wait to try out at IFA, though, is the LG Rolly portable keyboard, which could be either a genius idea or a woeful gimmick.  Huawei is teasing a new smartphone for IFA that is all about touch. Rumors have circulated suggesting that the Chinese company would implement its own version of the Force Touch technology that is present in the Apple Watch and rumored for the next iPhone. There's precedent for Huawei attempting to preempt rumored Apple tech at IFA, with last year's Ascend P7 Sapphire being among the first to offer a sapphire crystal display. Then again, those same Force Touch rumors have been subject to counter-rumors about the feature being pulled, so everything is still very much in the air. What's for sure is that Huawei will try to make a splash with something unique at IFA 2015. It's also expected to give an update on the pricing and release date of the Android Wear-running Huawei Watch, which was introduced at MWC in March.   Motorola's parent company should probably be higher on this list — if it were measured in terms of importance, it would be — but unlike the preceding manufacturers, Lenovo seems to have kept most of its IFA plans under wraps. As the world's biggest PC vendor, Lenovo is likely to be one of the highlights of the show with its refreshed lineup of Windows machines. The company's Yoga line of convertible devices could see updates to coincide with the availability of Windows 10 and the new Skylake chips from Intel, along with its consumer laptop lineup. It will also be interesting to see what smartphones, if any, Lenovo chooses to introduce at IFA. Rumors have been numerous if inconclusive, though the most interesting among them is for a 5.5-inch Vibe P1 Android handset that would purportedly come with a 5,000mAh battery. That would be fun to see.   IFA won't be the venue for unveiling Microsoft's new flagship Lumia smartphones, but it will still be a significant show for the Windows maker. With Windows 10 now out, everyone is gearing up to introduce new PCs to capture renewed interest and potential upgraders, and if Intel is able to bring its Skylake processors to market quickly enough, the old Wintel combination could spur a whole host of new machine sales. So consider this a universal prediction for every PC maker at IFA: there will be new stuff, and there'll be more of it than usual in order to sate every sort of demand out there. It's rare to see new processors and a new version of Windows lining up as perfectly as this year, so interest in Skylake computers running Windows 10 is likely to be high.   As with smartphone sales, the ""Other"" category at IFA is almost as significant as the big headliners. Just as electronics companies are branching out and attempting to build fashionable devices, so it is that companies from other industries are entering the electronics sphere. The most intriguing and outlandish designs at IFA are likely to come from those smaller players. And let's not forget the thriving accessories industry. USB Type-C peripherals are likely to start showing up, from the humble USB drive that can plug into both old and new slots to USB Type-C hubs that make it easier to use the new MacBook and Chromebook Pixel. IFA is a show about every kind of electronic device, and there's now scarcely a piece of human technology that isn't electronic in some way. So if you want to know what the latest state of the art is with toasters, washing machines, fridges, food processors, air humidifiers, and dehumidifiers, this is certainly the place to be. We can't promise that we'll write about them all, but if we find a rice cooker with a quad-core CPU inside it, we'll be sure to let you know.",0.6210611153089612,0.37893888469103876,0.18155588321695834,1605,4.7127725856697822,731,6.1367989056087549,0,28,"Google, Microsoft, Mobile, Tech, Preview"

It’s a device we can’t live without, but often feels like an arcane relic from an era when boxy tube monitors and dial-up modems ruled. The router is the gateway to high-speed internet in our homes, and it enables us to wirelessly connect countless gadgets — smartphones, laptops, TVs, thermostats, speakers, coffee makers, game consoles, the list goes on — to the internet. It’s only going to get more important as more and more appliances rely on Wi-Fi connectivity for modern conveniences.As important as they are, routers are equally notorious for being unattractive, difficult to set up, unreliable, and generally unpleasant to use. Most people use the router provided to them by their internet service provider (ISP), which may have terrible wireless range and a ridiculously complex setup process. Aftermarket routers, whether it be a model from Netgear, Asus, or even Apple, can provide better coverage and wireless range, but even those aren’t the easiest things to set up or manage.Google is attempting to flip that paradigm on its head with its new line of OnHub Wi-Fi routers. The first OnHub router is a $199 model manufactured by TP-Link to Google’s design and specifications. It's shipping this week and doesn’t look anything like a traditional router. A sleek cylinder with a matte blue or black finish, the OnHub ditches the traditional array of blinking lights for a single glowing status ring, and is something you could put anywhere in your house without much embarrassment. And the OnHub doesn’t just look good: it’s packed with powerful antennas to ensure optimal wireless coverage and throughput throughout your home. It’s all controlled with an easy-to-use app, making setup and troubleshooting much easier than with traditional routers.With the OnHub, Google is trying to solve the three biggest pain points of routers — setup, coverage, and troubleshooting — and build a wireless portal for the future. Did it also happen to create the perfect router? After switching out my current router and using the OnHub for the past few days in my own home, I want to say that Google has come awfully close, with just a couple of downsides that may or may not matter to you. Google is spending a lot of its marketing efforts around the OnHub talking about its design, and rightly so. The OnHub doesn’t look like any traditional router, save for perhaps Apple’s AirPort Extreme. It’s a sleek cylinder with no protruding antennas, lighting arrays, or ISP logos. All of that is for a reason: Google wants you to place the OnHub centrally in your home, which is the most ideal position for wireless coverage and range. To get most people to do that, it can’t look like something that dropped out of an alien spacecraft. Google’s point of centrally locating the OnHub in your home is valid: if it’s the same distance from every room in the house, wireless coverage is maximized to its full potential. Walls, furniture, appliances, and all of the normal stuff people have in their homes can block Wi-Fi signals, so having fewer of those in the way makes for a better experience. But the problem with this ideal concept is that most people’s broadband modem often isn’t in the center of the home. The OnHub has to be plugged into the modem in order to access the internet, making it extremely difficult to put it in a different physical location than your modem. Fortunately, the OnHub’s powerful wireless range made this a non-issue: I put it upstairs in my home office next to my cable modem, where my prior router was located. (More on wireless coverage later.) Setting up the OnHub in my home was painless: I plugged it in, downloaded the app to my smartphone (OnHub has apps for Android and iOS), and went through the setup process. That involves holding my phone near the router to pair it via audio signal and start the initial configuration, which is a lot easier than trying to directly connect my phone to a temporary wireless network or pair it over Bluetooth. All in all, I was up and running in less than five minutes, including naming my network and picking a password that I could easily remember. Even after you’ve set it up, you still might actually find yourself opening the OnHub’s mobile app. It makes it incredibly easy to see what devices are connected to your network and which ones are using the most bandwidth. You can prioritize bandwidth to specific devices, so if you’re having an online gaming session or want to stream 4K content to your TV, you can allocate the most bandwidth to those tasks. Rebooting the router is also done right from the app, as is updating its firmware, which Google says happens automatically. You can also share the network’s password with a friend just by showing them a screen from the app. It also lets you run speed tests — both from your ISP to your modem and from the OnHub to your wireless devices — making it easy to identify where a bottleneck might be occurring. The app even tells you what your speed enables you to do: whether that’s stream ultra HD 4K content or something less bandwidth-intensive, giving actual meaning to the upload and download numbers. One last thing: Google stridently denies that it’s tracking any of your activity on the internet with this router. It also says that the OnHub will work with any ISP, though your ISP might try to convince you that only its router works with its service. Prior to the OnHub, I had been using an Asus RT-AC66U dual-band wireless router in my modest, two-story, four-bedroom home. The Asus cost me about $200 and is a highly rated router, with configurable antennas, 2.4GHz and 5GHz network support, and lots of settings and options. At any given time, I would have a dozen or more devices connected to it, including smartphones, tablets, speakers, set top boxes, laptops, lightbulbs, and smoke detectors. But despite its cost and feature set, the Asus still needed the help of a wireless repeater to provide coverage in my downstairs bedroom. Other parts of the home had dead or extremely slow zones, and the video monitor we use for watching our infant would completely interfere with the 2.4GHz network, rendering it unusable. My expectations for the OnHub were thusly set: I was sure that placing it in my office would result in a similar experience I had with the Asus (and I wasn’t interested in piping Ethernet wires throughout my home to put it in a different spot). But I’ve had zero issues with the OnHub: coverage has been shockingly good, I haven’t needed to use the wireless repeater at all, and the interference I saw with the baby monitor has disappeared. In areas that were formerly dead zones, the OnHub has given me enough bandwidth and throughput to stream 4K video, even in my basement, a full two stories below my office. This is despite putting the router in a less-than-ideal location: upstairs, in my office, far from our general living areas. To make that happen, the OnHub employs a total of 13 internal antennas: six for its 2.4GHz network, six for 5GHz, and one to monitor the network and automatically tune the radios to the best settings. Google says the antennas are arranged within the OnHub for the best possible coverage regardless of how the router itself is positioned. The front-facing 2.4GHz antenna has also been custom designed with a special reflector to boost coverage in that direction. All of that means I didn’t have to do anything to optimize the radio coverage (nor could I, really). I just put the OnHub in my office, set it up, and went about my life. Unlike a lot of routers, the OnHub doesn’t broadcast separate 2.4GHz and 5GHz networks. Instead, the same network name (or SSID) covers both frequencies, and the OnHub will dynamically adjust network depending on which frequency offers the best blend of coverage, speed, and minimal interference. (Typically, 2.4GHz networks have broader range, while 5GHz ones have higher throughput and less interference from other devices, such as my baby monitor.) That makes it easy when adding a device to the network: there’s only one option to choose from and one password you need to input. There are a couple of things that make the OnHub less than perfect, and they center around Google’s oversimplified design. The OnHub only has one Ethernet LAN port, which was quickly filled by my Philips Hue, leaving me no other ports to plug in any other smart home gadget that requires a dedicated hub or use a wired connection with my desktop computer. To get more ports, I’d have to purchase and use a network hub, which adds another level of cost and complexity that the OnHub was designed to eliminate. There’s also only one USB port on the OnHub and it's not even active at the moment, making it impossible to use both a media server and a backup hard drive at the same time even when it is enabled. Most of those complaints are power-user issues, I admit, but they are features that buyers of $200 routers have come to expect. Google says this OnHub is only the first in a line, however. Future models from other manufacturers, including Asus, are coming later on. It’s certainly possible that those models could include more USB and Ethernet ports, though there’s no guarantee that they will or how much they might cost if they do. Google also says the OnHub is set up for future smart home products, including its own forthcoming Weave platform, and it has built-in Bluetooth and Zigbee radios that are not currently enabled. The company claims that it will be improving the OnHub over time with more features and capabilities via firmware updates, but beyond adding the aforementioned smart home and USB support, it’s not clear what exactly those upgrades will offer. One thing that doesn’t seem possible with this model is Amazon Echo-like functionality: the OnHub has a speaker, but lacks a microphone, making it unable to respond to voice controls. Of course, the million-dollar (or $199) question here is: do you really need to spend this much on a wireless router when you can get one for free from your ISP or choose a basic third-party option for as little as $50? Many of my colleagues balked at the price of the OnHub when it was announced a couple of weeks ago, but as someone who’s already been down the road of buying a high-end router to cover my home, I can easily see its value. If you live in a small apartment, chances are you don’t need the power the OnHub offers (though perhaps you could benefit from its simplicity and app-based control). But for any modest sized or larger home, the benefits of the OnHub are readily apparent: it just works better than any other router I’ve used, whether that was provided by my ISP or purchased separately. The humble router has been important for years and will be increasingly important as more and more products add Wi-Fi features. A few years from now, things such as a Wi-Fi-enabled toaster, washing machine, door bell, or garage door opener won’t be the domain of early adopters, they will be commonplace. All of them require a solid Wi-Fi network and strong router powering that network. The OnHub may not be the first router designed specifically with that future in mind, but it’s by far the best option right now. Like most appliances, the router is supposed to be invisible, do its job, and stay out of your way. For the first time, I can say my router does just that — I don’t have to worry about whether or not my Wi-Fi is working with the OnHub because it just does. Google has a grander ambition for the OnHub and its followup products, but even if that never comes to fruition, having usable Wi-Fi anywhere in my home is worth the $199 to me. Update: This article has been clarified to note that the USB port is not currently active on the OnHub.",0.6363533549399991,0.3636466450600009,0.16219801950837698,2054,4.8023369036027264,845,6.3562130177514797,0,28,"Google, Home, Tech, Review"

The ""Chronograph"" model tells time with three separate hands and dials for hours, minutes, and seconds, while the ""Three Hands"" model just has a regular watch face. Both models are 42mm across; the Three Hands watch itself is expected to run for three years, while Chronograph should last for five. The band, however, is rated for a week before it needs to be charged via a cradle. The Wena Wrist is expected to ship in March and April next year. Prices range from ¥34,800 ($287) for a silver Three Hands model up to ¥69,800 ($576) for the Chronograph in black.

In a post on T-Mobile's blog, CEO John Legere has publicly called out ""a fraction of a percent"" of users who've been sucking down hundreds or even thousands of gigabytes of data each month. But these customers aren't using all of that data on their smartphones alone; instead, T-Mobile claims they've come up with ways to conceal mobile tethering and hotspot usage. Tethering allows customers to get other devices (PCs, tablets, etc.) online using their smartphone data plan. ""I won't let a few thieves ruin things for anyone else."" With its $80 unlimited data plan, T-Mobile already offers a generous 7GB limit for tethering purposes. Once customers exceed that, their hotspot speeds are slowed down considerably. But there are many apps — particularly on Android — that promise to hide tethering activity from wireless carriers, making it hard to distinguish what data is actually being used for. By going this route, T-Mobile's hungriest data users can blow past the 7GB ceiling and keep tethering at full speed. Legere claims some people are doing exactly that, and he's not happy about it. In the most extreme cases, these customers are eating up as much as 2TB (yes, terabytes) per month, so they're using T-Mobile's network for way more than checking Facebook or streaming Spotify.

Starting today, those users will receive a warning from the Uncarrier imploring them to stop immediately.

Today, however, it's a big challenge. Researchers find themselves staring at piles of bones, often unable to tell whether they're looking at multiple animals, different species, or one individual with a number of variations. Because of that, researchers seem to agree that there's been no convincing evidence so far for sex-based differences — like the mane on a male lion, a phenomenon scientists call ""sexual dimorphism"" — in any dinosaur, despite those differences being common among modern animals.  ""It's a feature we'd expect to see."" Despite those difficulties, a researcher at the University of Bristol now says that he's found the ""best evidence yet"" for sexual dimorphism in one species of Stegosaurus. In a paper published this afternoon in PLOS One, Evan Saitta describes differences in the plates running along the spine of the Stegosaurus mjosi that may differentiate the species' males and females. ""There's simply no other explanation"" for the different plates, Saitta tells The Verge. In the work, performed while he was an undergraduate at Princeton University, Saitta identified two types of plates: one that was narrow and tall and another that was shorter but much wider. ""By ruling out other possible explanations, I can say with some confidence that I think it is sexual dimorphism that's causing the two distinct types of plates,"" he says. The males, he posits, likely had the wider plates, potentially as a way to attract mates.     To land on sexual dimorphism, Saitta first had to rule out quite a few other alternate possibilities — possibilities that papers in the past have failed to address. Those include whether these plates could have come from Stegosaurus of different ages, from different species of Stegosaurus, or from common variations within the species that would occur regardless of sex. Having eliminated those possibilities using aging techniques and observations of multiple specimens, Saitta settled on sexual dimorphism as the reason for the differences. ""Male and female sexual dimorphism is the only thing that's left,"" he says. ""It makes sense, too. It's a feature we'd expect to see."" ""I would not accept this as evidence of sexual dimorphism."" While sexual dimorphism is certainly a possible explanation, other researchers aren't quite as convinced as Saitta. Kevin Padian, a paleontologist and professor of integrative biology at University of California, Berkeley who wasn't involved in the study, says that he sees ""no evidence"" of a distinction between the two plate types that Saitta identifies. ""Without better association documented, or better skeletochronology, you can’t tell,"" Padian writes in an email to The Verge. ""At any rate I would not accept this as evidence of sexual dimorphism, or of dimorphism at all."" Basically, Padian sees Saitta's study as falling victim to the same gaps in research as prior reports on sexual dimorphism in dinosaurs. He doesn't see the study as being able to rule out the many alternate possibilities for why these differences exist. ""There is no convincing evidence of how many animals are present, how the bones and plates may be associated, whether the animal(s) in question may be fully grown, or what the absolute age of any specimen is,"" Padian writes. Another paleontologist contacted by The Verge, who was not involved in the study and did not want to publicly criticize the work, agreed that there were issues with the findings. He said that the study presents a good case for dimorphism, but that it isn't necessarily sexual — it could still turn out to represent other differences, such as distinctions between species. If dimorphism is present, it could be for other purposes Saitta disagrees with their conclusions, writing in an email to The Verge that it sounded like Padian ""looked for anything that might counter my claims without actually reading through the whole of the evidence."" (Padian says that the study's supplemental material doesn't change the story.) ""Determining sexual dimorphism is about ruling out other possibilities,"" Saitta writes. ""I stand by my statement that these stegosaurs represent the best evidence yet for sexual dimorphism, as did my peer reviewers, since other possibilities have been tested for."" Albert Prieto-Marquez, an evolutionary biology researcher who is also at the University of Bristol but was not involved in the study, reiterates that idea in an email to The Verge. ""This is a rare case among dinosaurs in which sexual dimorphism could be shown to be the hypothesis that best fits the morphological data in the fossils,"" he writes. Concerns with the paper only underscore how difficult it remains to identify sexual dimorphism in dinosaurs. That is — if it existed at all. It's possible that dinosaurs' ornamentation, like the plates on the back of a Stegosaurus, were actually used for other purposes, such as identifying separate species, rather than identifying males and females within a species. ""Some people were suggesting that maybe it was for species recognition and all that,"" Saitta says. ""I think that's a generalization. Simply looking at living animals today, the presence of sexual dimorphism is so widespread ... that it's unbelievable to think that no dinosaurs were sexually dimorphic. I just don't see how that's possible.""",0.5656980654810639,0.43430193451893606,0.15732638926111833,890,5.2089887640449435,424,6.4174528301886795,0,2,Science

These chemicals are often applied to seeds before planting, so that the poison permeates the entire plant as it grows, including its pollen and nectar. The European Union placed a moratorium on the chemicals even as research results were mixed: at the doses honey bees might experience on a farm, neonicotinoids seemed to cause disorientation and a weakening of the immune system, but nothing to explain the die-offs. Now, two studies published in Nature indicate the neonicotinoids are a problem for pollinators, though not in the way many first assumed. In the first study, researchers at Lund University looked at 16 fields of oilseed rape, a major source of vegetable oil, in southern Sweden. Half were planted with seeds coated in a neonicotinoid and a fungicide; the other half, the control, had seeds coated with only fungicide. The researchers found that placing bumblebees near the neonicotinoid-treated fields impeded the ability of colonies to grow and reproduce. Solitary bees also failed to reproduce near treated fields. The honey bee colonies, however, showed no signs of negative effects from the insecticide.  ""We saw significant influence from treatments on wild bees,"" Maj Rundlof, the lead author on the study, said at a press briefing. The population density of wild bees — that is, bumblebees and the solitary Osmia bicornis bee — fell by about half near the fields treated with neonicotinoids. Bumblebee colonies near the treated fields grew more slowly and produced fewer queens than colonies near the control fields. At six of the eight control fields, Osmia bees built brood cells to hatch the next generation, but they failed to do so at any of the treated fields. ""To some extent it’s not surprising that an insecticide has negative consequences on insects,"" said Henrik Smith, another author on the paper. It’s unclear exactly how the neonicotinoids — or neonics, as they’re often called — harmed the bees, but past studies offer clues. Maybe the treatments impaired the Osmia bees’ ability to navigate, the researchers speculate, an effect seen in previous studies of neonicotinoids. The insecticide could also impair the bumblebees’ ability to forage for pollen and care for their brood. ""This is certainly the most decisive work we’ve seen on neonics."" The finding that honey bees didn’t show signs of harm shouldn’t be a complete surprise either. Honey bees live in such large colonies and regenerate so quickly that thousands of bees can die without significantly effecting the hive. Their resilience is part of the reason they’re used for migratory crop pollination, rather than bumblebees, which live in colonies of tens or hundreds, or solitary bees. Previous work suggests honey bees may also be better at detoxifying after neonicotinoid exposure than bumblebees. The researchers also caution that their study shouldn’t be taken as a sign that honey bees aren’t harmed at all: because so much can vary in a field study, anything less than a 20 percent decline in colony size wouldn’t be detected, and there could be longer-term effects. The density of wild bees fell by half ""This is certainly the most decisive work we’ve seen on neonics at field-relevant doses,"" says Dennis vanEngelsdorp, an entomologist at the University of Maryland bee laboratory. Van Engelsdorp was also one of the first researchers to study Colony Collapse Disorder after it emerged in 2006, and when neonics were a prime suspect. Honey bees have continued to die at higher than normal rates since then — about a third of the managed colonies in the country each year — though the mass vanishing symptomatic of CCD is less common. (The total bee population has stayed about the same, a testament to both the resilience of honey bee colonies and to beekeepers’ efforts.) Researchers now believe that a mix of factors are combining to kill the bees, namely a lack of flowering plants due to monocrop agriculture, disease, parasites, and exposure to pesticides. If neonicotinoids are playing a role, in that mix, vanEngelsdorp says, the study suggests that it’s probably minimal. ""The really important finding is that levels that aren’t affecting honey bees are affecting native bees."" This finding is troubling in its own right, especially given that honey bees are the model species for measuring potential impacts of new pesticides on pollinators. Neonics represent more than one-fifth of the world’s insecticide market and are common on crops like corn, canola, cotton, and soy. If honey bees are better able to handle pesticide exposure, there’s a risk that bumblebees and other native bees have been dying undetected.   There’s no comprehensive record of non-honey bee populations, but what studies exist show disturbing declines. Nearly a third of the bumblebee species in the United States are declining, according to the Xerces Society. As with the honey bees, it’s not just pesticides: disease and habitat loss also likely play major roles. These bees also pollinate crops and native plants, often more efficiently than honey bees, having evolved in tandem with them. The second study looks at whether bees can detect, and therefore avoid, neonicotinoid-treated plants. It turns out the bees appear to prefer treated plants. ""We were both a bit shocked."" The study came out of an earlier experiment by Erin Jo Tiedeken at Trinity College, Dublin, designed to measure whether bumblebees can detect toxins in sucrose syrup, a stand-in for nectar. She placed a bumblebee in a plastic box along with two tubes of sucrose syrup, one of which was laced with a neonicotinoid. After waiting 24 hours, the researchers weighed the tubes to see which the bees had eaten from, expecting to find either no difference, if the bees couldn’t detect the toxin, or a preference for the pure syrup, if they could. Instead they found the bee preferred the toxic syrup. ""We were both a bit shocked,"" said Geraldine Wright, another author on the study. As part of the more comprehensive experiment, the researchers presented the bees with neonicotinoid-laced syrup and found that the neurons on their proboscises didn’t  respond as they would if presented with other types of toxins. ""I don’t think they can taste it at all,"" Wright said. Yet the second experiment found that both bumblebees and honey bees prefer syrup with levels of neonicotinoids comparable to what they’d experience in a seed-treated field. It could be having a pharmacological effect It’s unclear why bees would prefer neonics, especially if they don't seem to taste it, but vanEnglesdorp cautions that it could be dilution itself that creates the attraction, because natural nectar isn’t 100 percent pure sucrose. He agrees that the study shows bees aren’t deterred from consuming neonics. Another possible explanation for their preference is neurological: maybe, Wright reasoned at the briefing, bees are experiencing low doses of neonicotinoids as rewarding on some level and returning to the toxic food tube.  ""A little bit is medicine, a lot’s a toxin,"" Wright said, comparing the insecticide-laced syrup to cigarettes. After all, nicotine is produced by plants as a defense against insects, and neonicotinoids are derived from that; maybe small doses of neonicotinoids function similarly to nicotine in humans, with low doses having a pharmacological effect. Wright said that further research would be needed to find out whether bees actually get addicted to the insecticide.",0.2686144367797768,0.7313855632202232,0.48609624335666163,1238,5.2067851373182554,596,6.474832214765101,0,2,"Science, Report"

Their weapon of choice: all 163 pages of On Immunity: An Inoculation by Eula Biss, read aloud without interruption, a kind of incantation against misinformation and pseudoscience. Four rows of wooden pews were set up to seat readers and visitors, who also scattered along the high concrete steps lining the back of the store. On the bottom step sat a giant golden teddy bear.  At 6PM, after some brief opening remarks, organizer Maris Kreizman launched into the first lines of the book, which recall the myth of Achilles, ""whose mother tried to make him immortal."" (She missed a crucial spot on his heel.) Over the next four and a half hours, fiction writers, journalists, comic artists, poets, and essayists took turns at the microphone, each reading a single short chapter from the book. A kind of incantation against misinformation and pseudoscience Kreizman, who is the creator of literary and pop culture blog Slaughterhouse 90210, first proposed the On Immunity marathon reading idea on Twitter back in early February to raise awareness about the importance of vaccination. In January, an outbreak of the measles linked to Disneyland had spread to 84 cases in 14 states, and in 2014 the US reported 600 cases of the once-eradicated disease, the highest number in 20 years. The Disneyland outbreak resulted in a backlash against an increasingly vocal anti-vaccination fringe: one scientist was quoted calling parents of unvaccinated children ""selfish"" and ""dumb,"" while Los Angeles Times columnist Michael Hiltzik labeled antivaxxers ""public enemies."" When California legislators proposed legislation to kill vaccination exemptions based upon personal belief, the pendulum quickly swung in the other direction, with anti-vaccine leader Robert F. Kennedy calling vaccines a Holocaust. ""A few months ago, when things were really heating up and the anti-vax movement got a whole bunch of new spokesmen...I tweeted that I wished I could do a marathon reading of On Immunity, and the response was overwhelming,"" explained Kreizman, in an email. She quickly won the support of the book’s indie publisher Graywolf Press, gathered volunteer readers on Twitter, and called on writers she admired. Kreizman says she was inspired by Biss’ artful and relatable approach to a polarizing topic and came away from the book feeling smarter and more compassionate for those who oppose vaccination. A clear-eyed empathy for the fearful that has become rare in the hyperbolic vaccination ""debates"" Published at the end of September, On Immunity is the third book of nonfiction for Biss, who is known for her thorough research and lyrical style. The book takes us on a tour of the science, philosophy, myth, and literature that influence our thinking about immunity, inoculation, and disease, with stops along the way for Dracula, Susan Sontag, smallpox, H1N1, and witches. It asks readers to side with the science, even as it expresses a clear-eyed empathy for the fearful that has become rare in the hyperbolic vaccination ""debates."" Unfortunately, the vitriol typical of vaccination fights actually makes perfect sense, say some scientists and researchers. ""There is a whole domain within the field of social psychology re: 'attitude polarization' that describes how, in some cases, information contrary to our attitudes and opinions can make those attitudes more extreme and compel us to hold onto them even more strongly and confidently,"" wrote Kristin Hendrix, Psychology PhD and Assistant Professor of Pediatrics at Indiana University School of Medicine, in an email. Attempts to convince anti-vaxxers often backfire According to recent research in the journal Pediatrics by Brendan Nyhan, political blogger and assistant professor in the department of government at Dartmouth College, almost any direct challenge to anti-vaccination beliefs may cause parents to become even less willing to vaccinate. Nhyan found that whether you used dramatic narratives or horrible images of children suffering from vaccine-preventable disease, or offered scientific information that either emphasized the risks of going unvaccinated or debunked the dangers of vaccination, the result was a backfire effect. So far no one has figured out what does work to change minds intent on ignoring overwhelming and unanimous scientific consensus, but Hendrix is betting it needs start with empathy and respect. ""I think all of us who do research in this area advocate for respectful conversations and avoiding adversarial or confrontational communications,"" wrote Hendrix. ""When we’re talking about parents vaccinating their children, at the end of the day, everyone is just trying to do right by his/her child and do what they feel is in the best interest of their family. I think communication strategies that are predicated on empathy and respect are the ones that are, ultimately, the most successful."" If Hendrix is right, Kreizman’s low-key, understated event may have hit the mark. The audience was almost uniformly hushed and attentive, hovering around 20 as people came and went. Though some readers were more animated than others, the most dramatic moments occurred when someone stumbled over a difficult scientific term. By the time the readers finished, it was late and the store had closed. Given that there were almost no off-the-cuff speeches or deviations from the text, it did little to excite tempers in a way that could have generated a social media firestorm. Kreizman’s understated event may have hit the mark On the other hand, perhaps because of the lack of sensation (no food or alcohol was served, no loud celebrities attended, no gigantic sums of money were raised), news of the marathon is unlikely to reach the minority in the anti-vaccination camp, or even many pro-vaccine groups outside of the literary community. That’s too bad, because the message the event offered is one anti-vaxxers might actually be able to hear and pro-vaccine campaigners might want to heed. It’s impossible to know, of course, how things might have turned out if anti-vaxxers had gotten wind of the event and shown up. Would tempers have flared? Everyone there was pretty much in agreement that you should vaccinate your kids. The good news is, even if they didn’t hear about the event, maybe anti-vaxxers and pro-vaccine groups will hear about On Immunity itself. Though there are only 30,000 copies in circulation, the book recently got a little bump when it was chosen by Mark Zuckerberg for Facebook’s book club. (It landed on The New York Times Book Review’s list of best nonfiction books of 2014.) At least one of the marathon readers said the book made her rethink her own formerly aggressive approach to the subject. ""When I was asked to be part of the marathon reading of On Immunity, I said yes instantly, because that was the book that made me tone it down, for crying out loud,"" wrote Amy Brill, author of the novel The Movement of Stars and a mother of two girls, in an email.

The finding bodes well for a human drug trial that’s already underway in Sierra Leone — a country were nine cases of Ebola were reported just last week. The Ebola epidemic in West Africa is slowing down. A virus that used to infect hundreds of people every week now infects less than 50 a week worldwide. But for countries where Ebola is still present, the fight is far from over. The total number of infections since the outbreak started has reached 25,900, and more than 10,700 people have died. That’s why figuring out a way to prevent the infection via vaccines and to treat the infection via drugs is so important; Ebola is still a matter of life and death.  Monkeys that got the drug ""really didn’t get that sick."" In the study, researchers gave a lethal dose of the Ebola virus to six rhesus monkeys. Then, 72 hours later, the researchers administered an Ebola drug, called TKM-Ebola, to three of those monkeys intravenously. Nine days after being dosed, all the chimps that have been treated with the drug were still alive; those that hadn’t were dead. ""All three control animals developed classic hemorrhagic fever and succumbed to the disease,"" says Thomas Geisbert, an Ebola researcher at the University of Texas and a co-author of the study published in Nature today. The monkeys that got the drug, however, ""really didn’t get that sick."" ""Any treatment for Ebola that works in a time period where you can actually detect the virus already is something that’s potentially clinically promising — and that’s what you have here,"" says Darryl Falzarano, a virologist at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada who didn’t participate in this study. ""All the treatment animals survived. That sets the stage for a potentially useful clinical treatment."" The monkey trial ""sets the stage for a potentially useful clinical treatment."" The drug was originally created to fight the Kikwit Ebola strain — a strain that’s different from the one that spread in West Africa last year. Despite not being tailored for the current Makona strain, TKM-Ebola was given to a handful of patients in the US last year, Geisbert says. All the patients survived, but because these patients received a number of other drugs as well, it’s hard to tell whether the drug helped. TKM-Ebola, developed by the Vancouver-based Tekmira, works by stopping the production of specific Ebola proteins. If you don’t have that virus protein, you can’t make a functioning Ebola virus, Geisbert says. Moreover, one of these proteins interferes with the immune system of those who are infected. That means that preventing it from being produced indirectly helps infected monkeys battle Ebola. ""Not only are you slowing the virus’s growth, but you’re wrecking its ability to interfere with the host’s immune response,"" he says. The drug is promising, but it's an intravenous drug, which means it won't be easy to administer in the field. Moreover, it still needs to be tested on humans. That’s happening right now in Sierra Leone, but results aren’t yet available. In the meantime, Geisbert says that he would like to find out if the drug is effective four or five days after infection, instead of after only three. ""There’s a point when someone is so sick that no drug in the world is going to save their life,"" Geisbert says. ""But we want to know how far you can push all of these different technologies and still get some level of protection.""",0.3572250812649479,0.6427749187350521,0.8574869839394147,607,4.9588138385502472,324,5.9320987654320989,0,0,"Science, US & World"

Scientists believe that they can harness this phenomenon, using a network of incredibly accurate clocks spread across the surface of the Earth to measure its shape — a concept given the fantastic name of ""relativistic geodesy."" Currently though, not even the strontium clock is accurate enough to beat conventional methods of measuring the shape of the Earth (scientists suggest it would need to measure an elevational difference of just one centimeter to be useful).

While I do own DEET-based repellant, my main trick for avoiding bites is inviting my friend Allie along on hikes or camping trips — when we return, she's covered in mosquito bites, and I'm scot-free. Yes, mosquitoes really do like some people better than others, and a new paper from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine suggests there's a genetic component to that preference. In the study, scientists compared how attractive sets of twins were to mosquitoes, using groups of identical and fraternal twins. The identical twins were more similarly attractive to mosquitoes than the fraternal twins, according to the study, published in PLOS One. That's probably due to genetics — identical twins share more genes than fraternal ones. Those genes are important for determining body odor, which is part of how mosquitoes seek targets. Granted, it's a pretty small study — just 18 identical twins and 19 fraternal ones. The researchers chose twins because they're ""a good way to discover if a trait is heritable,"" study author James Logan, a senior lecturer at the London School, writes in an email. Scientists spend a lot of time thinking about what makes people attractive to biting insects Scientists spend a lot of time thinking about what makes people attractive to biting insects, since those insects can spread diseases like malaria, West Nile virus, chikungunya, and dengue, says Anandasankar Ray, an assistant professor of entomology at the University of California-Riverside. It's helpful to know how female mosquitoes — only females hunt, and only if they've mated — go about selecting their targets, so that better repellants can be designed. The system by which mosquitoes find a meal is fairly complex, Ray says (he wasn't involved in today's study). ""Mosquito navigation is a very sophisticated series of maneuvers,"" he says. ""When you think of a space shuttle being launched toward the ISS, you have phases: launch, the rocket disengaging, stage separation, then docking. In the same manner, a mosquito flying toward a human has stages."" Mosquitoes taste skin using hairs on their feet Flying upwind requires energy; the only time a female mosquito will do it is if she detects a plume of carbon dioxide — humans exhale about two liters of breath every minute, Ray says, and 4 percent of it is carbon dioxide. This activates the mosquito, making the insect more sensitive to skin odor. When mosquitoes are only a few meters away from a potential meal, they switch from navigating by carbon dioxide to skin odor — that's generally when they make a beeline for exposed skin, Ray says. Humidity and body temperature may play a role as well. Once the pest lands, it tastes the skin of its next meal using hairs on its feet. That gives scientists a lot of places to mess up mosquitoes' abilities to find their meals. Much of what we know about mosquito attraction has to do with carbon dioxide. People who exhale more of it tend to be more attractive to mosquitoes — so people who've been exercising or have larger body masses are pretty appealing targets. That's not all that drives mosquitoes, though. People who are infected with malaria are also more appealing to them, and some previous research suggests that skin bacteria — which produce some components of body odor — may also play a role. But some of a person's individual smell is pure genetics, and that's what today's study was meant to test.   The mosquito testing device (Logan et al.)  Scientists placed participants in pairs, then used a tube with a Y-shaped design. At the top two points of the Y was tasty, tasty skin — a hand from each of the two participants — and at the bottom point was the mosquito. The scientists measured how often mosquitoes picked each person to feed on, in order to get a sense of who was most attractive to the bugs, and who was least. They then compared attractiveness between sets of twins, and found the identical twins were closer in attractiveness levels — suggesting that the genes that control body odor may indeed play a role. The heritability values they found suggest similar levels to height and IQ, Logan and his team write in the paper, though the small sample size means they must be cautious about the comparison. It's also not clear from the study design whether the variation is due to attractive or repellant chemicals on the participants' skin. Future studies may focus on trying to link specific attractive or repellant odors — Logan's group has already discovered a few — to genetics. A major place to start searching is the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), a set of genes that code for proteins on the surfaces of cells. Linking odors from the MHC to mosquitoes' behavioral responses could lead to new mosquito repellants. ""Why am I more attractive than my wife?""And that's pretty important, Ray says. Right now, the major ways to avoid being bitten are DEET, a chemical that repels insects, and mosquito bed nets. New methods are needed, as some mosquitoes are now resistant to DEET. Ray's lab is developing new ways to try to keep the bugs from biting, and they're not the only ones working on the problem. ""With my mosquito work, I always get this question: why am I more attractive than my wife?"" Ray says. ""That’s one of the most interesting questions."" Today's work on body odor may help provide clues, so scientists can finally answer it.",0.6489682709567924,0.35103172904320756,0.7905632878355674,934,4.9047109207708779,489,5.9018404907975457,0,2,"Science, Report"

Besides carrying your DNA imprint for another generation, they’ll usually stick around long enough to ease you gently into that good night. But they can also be disruptive as hell, especially if you’re a woman working in the US tech industry — an industry that heavily skews male in a country with the worst family leave protections in the entire developed world.   Although it sounds like a paradox, giving men more time off actually benefits women in the workplace. See, paid maternity leave is often measured in weeks or months, while paid paternity can be as little as a few days — or nothing. Companies that offer family leave allowances to both parents equally set the expectation that fathers will take off just as much time as their child-bearing peers. A 2014 study already showed that if paternity time is paid, men will take it. The result is greater gender equality at work. Hiring managers and project leads won’t be inclined to discriminate against women out of fear they’ll eventually request maternity leave because both sexes risk abandoning the company during a crucial product delivery phase. That’s what makes the announcement of Netflix’s unlimited (for the first year) paid maternity and paternity policy (for birth and adoption) so significant. It's equal, it's generous, and it's easy: ""We want employees to have the flexibility and confidence to balance the needs of their growing families without worrying about work or finances. Parents can return part-time, full-time, or return and then go back out as needed. We’ll just keep paying them normally, eliminating the headache of switching to state or disability pay. Each employee gets to figure out what’s best for them and their family, and then works with their managers for coverage during their absences."" Tech companies already promote some of the most progressive parental leave policies in the US. The Netflix announcement raises the bar for Google, Facebook, Apple and others to match. Because some deliveries are more precious than others.  Last month I spent my Independence Day weekend in Cubelles, Spain — a town about an hour away from Barcelona — invited by Lexus to try out the hoverboard that it had been teasing in video spots since June. As with any hoverboard claim, I was skeptical going in: we knew that Lexus built an entire skatepark for it, but it wasn’t completely clear how it worked (if at all) and why they were going to all the trouble in the first place. Was it even remotely possible that Lexus — of all companies — was going to make the dream of the commercialized, go-anywhere hoverboard come true? Had they really done it? Pierce Brosnan, no-one's favorite James Bond apart from a few people who played too much Goldeneye 007 on the N64 as kids, has been stopped at an airport in Vermont for carrying a knife. A Burlington police lieutenant tells the AP that Brosnan was ""encountered by TSA at one of their checkpoints"" because of the knife, and eventually boarded the plane without further incident. The game promises to take players through the origin story of courier-slash-revolutionary Faith, described by senior EA producer Sara Jansson at Gamescom as ""a hero who is truly unique — dare I say the most unique hero in video games."" If you enjoyed the first Mirror's Edge then the new footage is pretty much everything you could hope for: there's free-running combat, an expansive (and disquietingly clean) city to explore, and, best of all, no guns. After some in-character teasing from Ryan Reynolds himself, the full-length Deadpool trailer is officially here.

The ultra-aggressive lines and massive rear wing of the all-new Vulcan make its purpose immediately obvious: this car has been designed for track use and track use only. In presenting it at the Geneva Motor Show this morning, Aston Martin CEO Andy Palmer described the Vulcan as the company's most extreme supercar ever. Powered by ""the most potent iteration yet"" of Aston Martin's 7-liter V12 engine, the Vulcan can produce more than 800bhp. Full performance details will be disclosed when the new car makes its track debut later in the year, but we already know that its body is made primarily out of carbon fiber and that it has a better power-to-weight ratio than cars competing in the FIA’s annual World Endurance Championship. More than just speed, Aston Martin promises the Vulcan will ""deliver a genuinely bespoke driving experience."" That starts with track training for new buyers, who'll get to race around in cars like the V12 Vantage S as they build up a familiarity with Aston Martin's finest. Even more enticing, this training will be conducted ""on some of the world’s most famous and glamorous race circuits.” Only 24 Vulcans will ever be produced, underlining the vehicle's exclusivity and Aston Martin's ambition to set ""a whole new standard in the ultra-high luxury supercar class."" At the other end of the (narrow) luxury spectrum, Aston Martin is introducing the more understated DBX concept, an electric all-wheel drive GT model that's packed full of electronic gizmos. The wing mirrors aren't mirrors, but cameras, channeling video to small displays on the inside of each door. At the center of the steering wheel resides a touchscreen. There are two arrays of solar panels at the rear. And the leather seats look like works of minimalist art. The DBX is Aston Martin's effort to appeal to a wider demographic. Women, younger people, and anyone else who might not have previously considered by an Aston Martin — the grand old marque wants to renew and expand its customer base, and it's doing it with a futuristic approach. The exterior of the car features milled aluminum elements and a special ""micro-fine layer of chrome to deliver a level of reflectivity that cannot be obtained through normal paint finishes."" Seeing it in person, all I could notice was the abundance of dust that gathered quickly and obviously atop the DBX's hood. Still, it has a luxuriously spacious interior, and it shows a 102-year-old institution of the car industry on a quest to embrace future technology. Just to avoid any confusion with the pictures below: the Vulcan is the crazy seafoam-green beast with an airplane-sized wing on its back, and the DBX is the excessively shiny silvery number that follows.",0.5231385468154008,0.47686145318459916,0.1704333262281135,486,4.9814814814814818,303,6.0363036303630366,0,78,"Transportation, Photo Essay, Videos"

Ford envisions the two bikes as part of a broader mobility system that integrates cars, bikes, and various other forms of transportation into a seamless, networked whole. Ford has been promoting alternate transportation research projects for a while, most notably at its most recent CES keynote, but these prototypes offer a more concrete look at the company's ambitions. Notably, some of the bike's most impressive features rely on connecting to other devices. An integrated iOS navigation app would direct users to the fastest route, potentially a mix of car, bike, and public transit. (The bike also has a built-in charging dock, in case batteries run low.) The most impressive feature is a No Sweat mode, which automatically activates the motor when the rider's heart rate climbs above a certain point, as measured by a bluetooth-connected health tracker.  A Detroit automaker might seem like an unlikely origin for a smartbike, but this isn't the first time Ford has experimented with pedal power.

In its two decades of existence, this car company has pushed more boundaries and designed more outlandish automobiles than most others can accomplish in a century. The latest Regera is no different. Debuting here at the Geneva Motor Show, it ratchets up the insanity a few notches yet again, this time starting with the utterly unreasonable headline number of 1,500bhp. The Regera is a hybrid (a plug-in hybrid, no less!) that combines the output of three electric motors (700bhp) with the power of a twin-turbo V8 gasoline engine (1,000bhp) to produce unspeakable amounts of speed. Combined, the drivetrain will propel all 3,131 dry pounds of the Regera from 0 to 400kmh — that's nearly 250mph — in under 20 seconds. Again, for emphasis: that's roughly Mach 0.33 in a third of a minute. It's not just about power, though — there's some tech, too. Koenigsegg advertises the Regera as ""the first fully robotized car,"" which is to say that everything that can open, close, or otherwise move around is electronically controlled. Using either a remote or a smartphone app, you'll be able to open the butterfly doors or adjust the front and rear wings. The rear wing is pretty cool, folding down into the car's construction for a perfectly streamlined shape when you don't need its active downforce. The rearview mirrors fold in automatically when the doors open through their 90-degree turn, adding ""practicality and visual drama"" to a typically mundane action. You can always do things the old-fashioned way, of course: with your hands. That was the only option available when I came around to gawk at Koenigsegg's new car, but the experience still had its charm. The carbon fiber doors are featherlight, and their alien feel seemed to match the uniqueness of the vehicle before me. There will be just 80 Koenigsegg Regeras ever made, which, for the sort of car that this is, actually sounds like quite an ambitious number. When you think of plug-in hybrids, Toyota's staid Prius is typically the first thing that comes to mind. And yet, here I am, standing next to a car that has both an electric-only mode for perfect silence and a full-power insanity mode that goes from 0 to 100kmh in 2.8 seconds. And it has CarPlay! All that incredible value can be yours for a price of $1.89 million plus taxes, with the first cars being delivered to their lucky owners in 2016. Regera is Swedish for the verb ""to reign"" — not kidding this time — and my brief encounter with the car that bears that name suggests that it's deserved. If the thing drives the way that it looks, it'll certainly live up to its proud title.

Sure, why not? Anyway, have a peek here at a few of the announcements ahead of press days — and get ready, because we'll be reporting from the show floor tomorrow and Wednesday.  Audi R8. The next generation of Audi's supercar doesn't look much different than the model it replaces, but make no mistake — there's a thoroughly new car underneath. Most interesting is the bespoke R8 e-tron, an all-electric version that has greater capacity and range than the Tesla Model S. Lamborghini Aventador LP750-4 Superveloce. Take the Aventador — already one of the most beautiful and outrageous production cars on the road today — add 50 horsepower, and remove over 100 pounds of fat. That's this. Bugatti Veyron Grand Sport Vitesse La Finale. After a ten-year run, Bugatti is writing its legendary hypercar's final chapter with the appropriately named La Finale. Bentley EXP 10 Speed 6. Bentley points to its EXP 10 Speed 6 as a new direction in styling for the luxury marque, and it's clearly more swoopy and svelte than anything the company currently offers. It's a concept car, but it hints at a possible new model line — a sports car that would fit alongside the Continental GT coupe rather than replace it. Aston Martin Vulcan. There will only be 24 of these track-only beasts offered, featuring a V12 engine good for over 800 horsepower. It looks like nothing else Aston Martin has ever made. Lexus LF-SA. Don't be fooled by the name: leaks suggest that the LF-SA has absolutely nothing to do with Lexus' LFA supercar. Instead, the LF-SA is a compact hatch that previews new styling elements for the brand. Mercedes-Benz G 500 4x42.  The 4x42 is designed to be the baddest-ass four-wheeler that Mercedes has ever offered, and judging from this picture, I see no reason to believe otherwise. NanoFlowCell Quant F. This is a follow-up to the Quant E shown at last year's Geneva show from NanoFlowCell, a Liechtenstein-based start-up that's working on flow battery drivetrains. It promises a 0-60 run in just 2.8 seconds, but the science behind the car is still under development — and the infrastructure to refuel it doesn't exist.

In agreeing to back the plan after a three-month consultation period, the government also narrowed the list of potential locations for construction to five — Campbeltown, Glasgow Prestwick, and Stornoway in Scotland, Newquay in England; and Llanbedr in Wales. A Royal Air Force base is also under consideration as a temporary location. Plans to build a spaceport in the country were first announced last July, when the British Civil Aviation Authority named eight sites as potential locations for construction. The government has supported the scheme as part of its aims to push Britain as a world leader in commercial space travel. ""I want Britain to lead the way in commercial spaceflight,"" said Robert Goodwill, the UK's aviation minster. ""Establishing a spaceport will ensure we are at the forefront of this exciting new technology."" The government will aim to attract the likes of SpaceX and Virgin Galactic to launch from the facility once it's closer to completion.   In addition to space travel, it's hoped the facility would drastically cut down on international travel times — companies involved in the construction of the spaceport say that the travel time from the UK to Australia could be slashed from 14 hours to two. But that's still a long way off. First, the Department for Transport will put together a specification of the spaceport's requirements, before asking outside companies to tender their proposals.

It's one of Britain's most recognizable buildings, but it will soon share its site with 1,300 homes and a hotel designed by architects Frank Gehry and Norman Foster. The architects showed their vision to the public yesterday, after winning the chance to work on 42-acre site in September 2013. A set of new buildings will be erected to the south, while the iconic station itself will be maintained. A decommissioned coal-fired power station, the Battersea plant was built in two stages: construction began on its first substation in 1929, before another substation was added in the 1950s. The building, with its four vast chimneys, now has a place on Britain's list of buildings of Special Architectural or Historic Interest. The architects had to preserve the power station in their designs Gehry and Foster's buildings will make up the third phase of new construction on the Battersea site. Five of the new structures are to be built by Gehry's firm. They have the architect's distinct take on deconstructivism. Their shape is almost organic, with flowing lines and asymmetrical designs that make the outer walls of the buildings appear to undulate and ripple. They're designed to house ground-level stores that open out onto a new shopping street, termed the ""Electric Boulevard."" Across that street will sit another building, designed by Foster's firm. The larger structure is architecturally different to the cluster of towers — it's sharper in aesthetic than Gehry's buildings — but its sinuous shape and curved design give it a similarly organic finish. That effect is set to be topped off by one of London's largest rooftop gardens. Both Gehry and Foster are internationally renowned for their craft. Gehry's works include the much-admired Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao and the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles, while Foster designed New York's Hearst Tower and London's 30 St Mary Axe (more commonly known as ""the Gherkin""). Their designs for the Battersea station will benefit from expanded travel links to the area. The power station is located on the banks of the river Thames, but at more than a mile from the nearest subway station, it's something of an inconvenient location. A new subway extension on the Northern line should make it simpler to see some of the UK's most memorable architecture — both old and new — in the same place when the project is complete.

Zuta Labs, which recently launched the Pocket Printer on Kickstarter, hopes so. The Pocket Printer, fundamentally, is a robotic Ouija planchette containing an inkjet printer head. Place it on a piece of paper, and it will slowly roll across it with an omnidirectional wheel system, printing as it goes. Currently, it can sync with computers, and the team is working on an Android and iOS app; it's supposed to be a printer you can take anywhere, although most people would probably just leave it on a desk in lieu of the standard box.  Unsurprisingly, its convenience comes with some limitations. The estimated print speed is about 1.2 pages per minute, compared to 10 or more pages per minute for a desktop inkjet printer, and its resolution is currently an unimpressive 96 x 192 dpi. It runs on a rechargeable battery that gives you about an hour of print time, and one cartridge is good for 1,000 standard pages; that's not the greatest yield you'll find for a printer, but it's several times higher than some standard desktop inkjet cartridges. The pointed end is designed to tell you where to set it on the page, but the obvious worry is that unless you have a perfectly flat surface, correctly align the arrow, and avoid any bumps or tilts, you'll get a crooked print job. For multiple pages, the printer will stop at the end of one, then wait for you to pick it up and put it down on the next.   Adorable experiments like the Little Printer aside, home printers are loathsome and frustrating beasts, so Zuta Labs can go far simply by offering something different. It can be configured to print for any size of paper, and in theory it can even print on other kinds of surfaces, which makes it a lot more flexible than the standard inkjet, assuming it actually works. In its promotional video, the team shows off a prototype without the roughly four-inch-tall polycarbonate shell, successfully printing a message to Kickstarter backers. For now, it's grayscale only, but a color version is planned for the future. The final question is whether the Pocket Printer can actually make its hefty $400,000 goal; right now, it's sitting at around $10,000 with 29 days to go. To get a printer as part of the campaign, you'll have to pay at least $180, which makes it a bit more than an impulse buy.

True to his roots though, the drones were armed with cans of spray paint, which KATSU used to create abstract works over blank canvases.  KATSU initially wanted the drones to write graffiti According to The Hole gallery, which will be hosting the works at the first Silicon Valley Contemporary art fair, KATSU spent several months experimenting with different weights of paint and different methods for activating the spray cans. Alongside the paintings, the gallery will show a video of how the works were made and the technology that KATSU used to create them. The full fair runs from April 10th through the 13th and includes a body of contemporary works, including video art, multimedia presentations, and digital installations. KATSU apparently began work on the drones with the intention of programming them to write graffiti. In the end, it seems that their results became too imperfect: the force of their twirling propellers would whip the paint around, and the force of the paint would cause the drone to wobble as it attempted to stabilize itself. While that creates a decidedly abstract result, it was still created by KATSU's hand — just a few steps removed and distinctly colored by the drone.

The ash-covered landscapes, the crashing waves of a turbulent sea, the smoky, toxic air — it's all make-believe. Forge is a series of works from British artist Luke Evans that turns the ordinary into the unforgettable. Using a mixture of common materials, Evans crafts intricate landscapes in miniature on his kitchen table. The image above takes self-raising flour, paint, fragments of brick, and heated glycerine (a simple $1 throat medicine), and arranges them into an otherworldly scene. The objects pictured measure just a few inches across, so to achieve the grand sense of scale Evans flipped a popular photographic technique on its head. Tilt-shift photography has been around for a long time, but it's not often used like this. While regular lenses are always placed directly in front of a sensor at 90 degrees, tilt-shift lenses can either tilt or slide away from the sensor, granting a photographer control over the focal plane in a way that's impossible with other lenses. The most-common use for this technique is to make large objects look small. Tilt-shifting a cityscape can make the objects in focus appear more like a model village than real life. With the rise of Instagram, users have been able to replicate this effect to some extent by controlling exactly what's in focus. For Forge, Evans connected one of the lenses to a Phase One IQ180 medium format camera, but instead of restricting the focal plane to just one object or area, he used the lens to get almost the entirety of each scene in focus. To complete the illusion, he then used a single light source with no reflectors to mimic sunlight, and created ""fog"" by heating glycerine in a frying pan and waving it over the scene. It's this innovative use of the tilt-shift lens, coupled with lighting and a clever use of perspective, that makes these tiny piles of brick and flour seem like full-sized landscapes.  The idea for Forge literally came by accident. ""I was breaking bread one day and I knocked flour all over the worktop,"" Evans tells The Verge, ""it looked like some strange martian landscape; I took some quick photos and the idea was born."" The artist decided to experiment with the idea of creating miniature landscapes, but as he was on a tight budget (Evans is a full-time student), he had to limit himself to random materials he could find in his house. Each image presented its own challenge, but none was more challenging than the ""sea spray"" image below. ""I had to wave fog over the set, fling salt at the rock, and press the shutter all in succession to get the final image. It took weeks to get it just right."" For Evans, his meticulous work has paid off. Although he's yet to complete his final year of a Design and Photography degree at Kingston University, Forge has been selected for an upcoming exhibition at London's world-renowned Saatchi Gallery.  Waves crash against sea rocks in this image, created using salt, heated glycerine, brick, shaving foam, paint, saran wrap, and paper.

Because it stems from “retrospective,” says the Danish designer, “it means you’re looking in the wrong direction.” He prefers to think of heritage instead, a concept that simultaneously acknowledges where a design comes from and looks to where it needs to be going.  Lenovo’s Arimasa Naitoh thinks along similar lines. He has led the ThinkPad laptop team ever since its inception in 1992 and remains conscious of the need for “commonality and consistency” between models, so that familiarity with one ThinkPad would make people comfortable with the company’s entire line. That’s why ThinkPads are always black and will, as long as Naitoh is around, continue to punctuate their keyboards with the signature red TrackPoint nub.  Whether explicitly hearkening back to a bygone era or simply maintaining an unaltered design for so long that it gets classified as retro, Warming and Naitoh face a similar challenge: how do you evolve a classic design? The same qualities that make a particular product compelling — whether it evokes a sense of nostalgia or offers superior usability — are the ones that militate against changing it. Lenovo and Mini are hardly alone in that respect, either, with everyone from sports shoe manufacturers to camera makers coming up against the ghost of achievements past. Mini’s solution to balancing the conflicting demands of heritage and innovation has been to give equal weight to both. The company’s latest Mini Cooper model retains familiar design motifs, but augments them with modern technologies and sensibilities. The chrome rings around the headlights are still present, but you can now choose LED lights instead of halogens. A consistent theme of ""accelerated"" elliptical shapes permeates the interior, but the round center console that inspired it has evolved into a color display that speaks to your smartphone and helps park the car. The genesis of the original 1959 Mini can be found in simple pragmatism. A shortage of oil supply in the late '50s made frugal cars more appealing, which spawned the distinctly utilitarian first Mini. It had four seats, four wheels, an engine, and a trunk. Every design decision was driven by the need to cut costs and maximize the efficient use of space. Warming tells The Verge that, even though the 2014 Cooper is longer, taller, and wider than its forefather, it remains faithful to that philosophy of efficiency. There’s an improved three-cylinder engine, a new suspension system, and a much more generous trunk than even the outgoing Mini was able to offer. The car remains focused on practicality, but it's using more space to give its user more — staying true to the spirit, if not the boundaries, of its original concept. While Mini can be said to be responding to the perceived expectations of a more demanding consumer, Nikon takes a more literal approach. The Japanese camera company has one overarching principle guiding its product development decisions: ""You listen to the customer."" Hiro Sebata, product manager for the Nikon Df, explains that the retro-styled camera’s introduction was a direct response to consumer demand. Camera enthusiasts have been pestering Nikon to recreate its iconic designs from the 1970s and ‘80s, and after four years of development, the Df emerged as the answer. Nikon didn't replicate any one particular camera, picking and choosing elements from its early F and FM series and combining them with its latest digital imaging sensor. The ""f"" in the Df's name stands for the aim of ""fusion:"" a marriage of the tactile joys of yesteryear and the convenience of modern electronics. That's precisely the goal every retro design aspires to, and the Nikon Df is an instructive example of how most end up. While it has components of both past and present, it fails to combine them in a coherent way and feels like a mismatched pair of cameras forced to behave as one. In failing to produce an exact facsimile of its established designs, Nikon may have disappointed its fans, but it also took the risk of trying something new. The Df's shortcomings today can inform the company about how to keep iterating into future, as its mantra remains unaltered. Nikon believes that even beloved designs can be improved upon, and the surest way to find out how is to heed the feedback of those for whom you are designing. Lenovo’s ThinkPads are among the best examples of how a company can keep improving a design without ever straying too far from its roots. Black, austere, functional, and reliable, ThinkPad laptops seem to have never felt the need to evolve, but a closer inspection reveals that’s exactly what they’ve been doing over the two decades of their existence. ThinkPads have grown slimmer, adopted exotic new materials like carbon fiber, and introduced fresh thinking with technologies like the Owl Wing cooling system and slice batteries. Today’s laptops are quieter, more powerful, and longer-lasting than their predecessors. What hasn’t changed is the aesthetic and the user experience. The original ThinkPad 700c had an excellent keyboard and that pedigree is carried on through the latest X and T series laptops. Though the new keyboard’s concave keys and short travel are far removed from those used by the ThinkPad’s earliest adopters, it maintains the same emphasis on tactility. Lenovo’s design chief David Hill puts it bluntly: ""If you have square fingers, type on a square keyboard. Otherwise type on a ThinkPad."" Having recently celebrated its 20th anniversary, the ThinkPad can look back on a history of gradual evolution — one that integrates the latest functional upgrades like touchscreens and new processors without sacrificing the look and feel that made it a success in the first place. Inevitably, there are exceptions to the rule of incremental evolution, such as the stark choice of opting not to change anything at all. Sony, a company that prides itself on forward-looking and experimental design, has a product in its portfolio that’s been left unchanged since 1985. The MDR-V6 professional studio headphones continue to be sold in their original form to this day, withstanding nearly 30 years of fads and fashions. A 1991 successor dubbed the MDR-7506 only changed some of the V6’s internal wiring and remains just as venerated. With the convenience of a folding design and an exceptionally neutral sound response, the V6 was an instant hit with sound engineers and DJs, giving them most of what they wanted and little of what they didn’t. Sony recognized the popularity and success of its design and simply let it stand. The V6’s spartan appearance and coiled cable have been around long enough to now evoke a bygone era, showing how a product can slip into the retro category by virtue of great longevity alone. Unlike Sony, LG lacks a gloried product history of its own, but that hasn’t left the company tone-deaf to consumers’ nostalgic needs. ""We are all surrounded by digital products which are mostly ‘cold’ emotionally,"" says Patricke Shim from LG’s TV design team. To counter that, the company’s Retro TV set is designed to deliver an ""analog emotion"" such as your parents might have felt when adjusting the rotary dials of their television back in the 1970s. Surrounded by wooden panels and styled to look like an artifact from times past, the Retro TV aims to recreate the appeal of yesteryear without any of its downsides. That means it’s much more compact than the CRTs it’s imitating and you do get a remote control in the box. As electronic devices become further commodified, more and more of them are seeking to stand out with quirky and unusual designs. TEAC follows a similar path to LG with its retro-styled Bluetooth radio, whose chrome-laced aesthetic is derived from the styling of 1950s American automobiles. Or, if you’re a fan of Super 8mm film, you can buy a conventional digital camcorder that’s styled exactly like the pistol-grip cameras of the ‘60s. From the moustachioed hipster wearing Chuck Taylors at your local cafe to the diehard photographer rationing out his last rolls of film, there’s no escaping the infectious passion for all things retro. For some, the motivation may be wistful nostalgia, while for others it represents a physical means to connect with a past they may not have been around to experience. Whatever the cause, the desire for vintage gear is as strong as it’s ever been. Retro is in, but retro is also hard. When companies revive winning designs from their past, the choice between what to keep and what to modernize becomes paramount. Is the TrackPoint truly the red beating heart of a ThinkPad? Can Sony's V6 headphones actually stand to be improved? BMW, Mini's parent company, proudly proclaims that ""design classics don't become older. They become more timeless."" But it's the exact quality of timelessness that makes successful retro designs so rare. Explicitly retro designs don’t aim for perfect historic reproductions but rather a recreation of the visual and tactile appeal of times past. Oddly, even though most iconic products gain their notoriety because of their mechanics, materials, and dimensions, those are actually the first things that their designers look to change and update. It's the aesthetic and superficial quality that companies and consumers alike seem unwilling to sacrifice. The end result is a core of modern technology wrapped up in a classic look and feel. The designers who succeed are those that can bring back the essence of retro without losing the comforts of modernity.",0.6417296933932649,0.3582703066067351,0.18680444310654631,1617,5.1298701298701301,835,6.5844311377245512,0,0,

Funding expected to be used for internet satellites The Information first reported the funding on Monday, saying that the financing round was meant to bolster the development of SpaceX satellites that could be used to send internet to areas where it isn't currently accessible across the globe. Spreading internet access has been an ongoing goal for Google, so this investment fits in nicely with other projects that it's been working on. Musk described the satellite internet initiative to Bloomberg last week, saying that it would both speed up the internet as we know it and bring internet access to 3 billion people who currently have only poor access. Musk says that sending data over satellites will be far faster than having it sent over wires that have to jump from router to router until it arrives at its destination. Naturally, that isn't ambitious enough for Musk, so he's also hoping that it'll be the start of a SpaceX internet connection to Mars. ""People should not expect this to be active sooner than five years,"" Musk tells Bloomberg. He expects the project to cost around $10 billion, so while Google and Fidelity's funding will help, it may just be enough to get the first satellites off the ground.

It was initially speculated that  SpaceX's chief executive Elon Musk would be the one to partner with OneWeb, but Branson, along with the telecommunications company Qualcomm, has beat him to it. OneWeb, previously called WorldVu, aims to bring internet access to those without it, including third world countries, rural areas in developed countries like the US, and airlines. The service will be powered by a constellation of 648 satellites. The service will be powered by a constellation of 648 satellites OneWeb will launch the 250-pound satellites with the help of Virgin Galactic's LauncherOne, a rocket created to launch cargo into orbit. Branson told CNBC, ""We believe this is a very efficient way of getting satellites into space. It's much more efficient than the big rockets of the past. We can literally take off every three or four hours."" At an altitude of around 1,200 kilometers (745 miles), the satellites should reach a throughput capacity of 8 gigabits per second. If the initial launch is successful, Branson said the company could launch up to 2,400 satellites. In a post on the Virgin website, Branson said, ""By the time our second constellation is developed, the company will have launched more satellites than there currently are in the sky."" Currently based in Britain's Channel Islands, OneWeb is in the process of creating small user terminals which will provide internet access at a rate of 50 megabits per second. Price estimates for the construction of the initial constellation hover around $2 billion. The launch could happen as early as 2017 This isn't the first attempt we've seen at space-based internet. Last year, Facebook and its nonprofit organization Internet.org shared plans of Boeing-sized, solar-powered internet connectivity drones, then Google nabbed commercial drone company Titan Aerospace out from under Facebook's fingers to work with its fleet of giant internet-beaming balloons, Project Loon. Some airlines, like United, are already using satellite-powered internet.

The announcement comes more than three months after the European Commission opened an investigation into Amazon's tax deal in Luxembourg, where a 2003 ruling has allowed the US retailer to operate nearly tax-free in Europe. The EC, which handles antitrust cases, published the preliminary findings of its investigation today, concluding that the 2003 ruling falls under the category of government aid. ""The Commission's preliminary view is that the tax ruling of 5 November 2003 by Luxembourg in favor of Amazon constitutes state aid... and the Commission has doubts at this stage as to that ruling's compatibility with the internal market,"" the report reads. Both sides have denied wrongdoing European antitrust regulators have opened similar investigations into Apple, Starbucks, and other multinational companies that are accused of exploiting loopholes to save billions in taxes. In September the EC said in a preliminary ruling that Ireland's tax policy for multinationals may constitute illegal state aid, and the Irish government announced plans to close its so-called ""double Irish"" loophole late last year. The crackdown comes as many cash-strapped European governments are looking to boost their budgets. In today's preliminary decision, the EC said Amazon's tax arrangement, whereby a Luxembourg subsidiary pays an internal royalty fee on intellectual property to another Amazon subsidiary, doesn't seem to fall within international guidelines. The arrangement reduces Amazon's tax liability in Europe, and ""is not related to output, sales, or to profit,"" the Commission said. It also raised concerns over the fact that the policy was hastily passed and has remained in place for more than 10 years ""without any revision."" Both Amazon and the Luxembourg government had previously denied any wrongdoing.

Intel's latest earnings report demonstrates that the IoT age is already upon us, accounting for $2.1 billion in revenue in 2014. That's 10 times as much as Intel generated from its Mobile and Communications division, which, in spite of its importance to the company, actually shrank in revenue over the course of the year. Setting new records for full-year revenue and shipments, Intel saw small increases in its income from the core PC Client Group (up 4 percent) and related software and services section (up 1 percent), but they were dwarfed by the 19 percent growth of the chipmaker's IoT division. The only thing coming close to matching that expansion is the 18 percent increase in revenue from the Data Center Group, which benefits from taking on the business of connecting, managing, and analyzing all the smart things that Intel's now involved in powering.  PCs are doing well, but connected things are growing five times as quickly Though inherently nebulous in its definition, the Internet of Things that Intel is selling is characterized by a diversity of sensors, wireless radios, and truly miniature processors that enhance what devices around us can sense and do. Perhaps the best embodiment of what that means for the future is the company's new Curie module, which fits a sensor hub, a Quark processor, and a Bluetooth connection inside the space of a button. Intel's robust earnings, even in spite of the delayed launch of its new Broadwell processor, also convey a resurgence in PC sales that has been forecasted to continue into 2015. Broadwell and the new USB Type-C standard are certainly making for a very appealing new year of laptops and other traditional computers, though the biggest growth is likely to once again be in the business of connecting things that were never smart or networked before.",0.3394398146831405,0.6605601853168594,0.18659308040528677,350,4.9171428571428573,214,5.8878504672897201,0,0,"Business, Tech"

The catalyst for that rollercoaster ride was a Reuters report alleging Samsung was courting BlackBerry with a $7.5 billion takeover bid, which was quickly refuted by officials from both Waterloo and Seoul. Though it’s now apparent that no imminent acquisition is in the offing, the mere rumor of Samsung buying BlackBerry proved appealing enough to get people to invest real money in it. Setting aside the credulity of overeager investors, there are three big reasons that can justify BlackBerry’s price and they all relate to its potential value to a global giant like Samsung. BlackBerry’s well-documented struggles as a smartphone maker tend to obscure the strength of its enterprise business. BlackBerry Enterprise Server (BES) is the gold standard for securing and managing mobile business communications, having been deployed by thousands of private and public organizations around the world. This market is unglamorous but reliably profitable, and Samsung has already demonstrated an appetite for it with its own Knox initiative on Android. Knox showed early momentum with approval for use by the US Department of Defense in 2013, however its security has since been called into question by a series of discovered vulnerabilities. Samsung’s response has been to integrate BlackBerry’s end-to-end encryption into Knox starting this year, but that solves only half the problem. Even under a best case scenario, Knox will take a long time to just get Samsung in through the office door, whereas the Korean company is looking to be a corporate player right away. Big businesses have an ingrained reluctance to changing established practices, which makes the incumbent BES unlikely to be ousted from its leading position any time soon. Acquiring ownership of it would solve two problems at once for Samsung: the Korean company would immediately become a major presence in offices everywhere and its revenue sheet would add a consistent source of income. That’s particularly salient to Samsung as it tries to overhaul its all-important mobile devices division and revive flagging sales, but there’s pretty much no big tech company that wouldn’t benefit from the addition of BES. Together with BlackBerry Messenger — which is also cross-platform, usable on iPhones and Android handsets as well as BlackBerrys — BES marks a spectacular upgrade over Samsung’s in-house Knox and recently cancelled ChatOn efforts. The crown jewel, in the words of CEO John Chen, of BlackBerry’s remaining assets is the QNX software platform. Noted for its security and flexibility, QNX is the predominant software used in modern car infotainment systems, even providing the basis for Apple’s CarPlay and recently supplanting Microsoft in Ford’s Sync 3. Samsung is going after the connected car and QNX is already there. Instead of fighting an uphill battle against the better software designers at Apple and Google, Samsung can establish a strong position for itself in smart vehicles by providing the platform underpinning middleware like CarPlay and Android Auto. Besides smarter cars, the other big theme of the Consumer Electronics Show that just wrapped up in Las Vegas was the Internet of Things (IoT), where Samsung has again expressed a desire to be a leader. As it happens, QNX has a number of IoT-related use cases — covering diverse industries like aerospace, defense, security systems, and medical devices — that would help Samsung’s plans for future growth. Those capabilities could be expanded more readily with Samsung’s depth of resources and breadth of operations, making QNX one of the top reasons Samsung would desire BlackBerry. The third pillar of BlackBerry’s enduring value is its patent portfolio. Decades of research and development into wireless systems and devices have built up an enviably deep pool of intellectual property. Valuations vary, but the patents by themselves would be worth billions of dollars, and Reuters’ source actually names them as the key attraction for Samsung. Through its subsidiary, Certicom, BlackBerry owns 130 highly regarded encryption patents — some of which are used by the NSA — that could come into play as more companies and services better secure their software and seek licensing to utilize those patents. We’ve already seen Google spend significantly more on acquiring Motorola’s library of patents, and BlackBerry’s might be the last appealing bundle of intellectual property left on the market. If Samsung doesn’t go aggressively after it, odds are that someone else will. Decoupling BlackBerry’s smartphone production from the rest of its operations helps to illuminate the company’s strengths, but any takeover would have to account for BlackBerry’s still significant hardware business. It continues to lag badly behind Android and the iPhone, and though BlackBerry OS is improving, the ecosystem gap is so vast that there’s little hope of it ever catching up. If there’s any ray of sunshine, it would come from a giant of Samsung’s stature putting its marketing and manufacturing muscle behind BB OS. For Samsung, the motivation would be the same as the one driving it to persist with its unloved Tizen OS in spite of little external support: avoiding an all-out reliance on Google and its Android platform. Still, with Samsung unlikely to shift its smartphone production or design, taking over BlackBerry phones would be accepting a liability rather than gaining an asset. In an overheated tech market where unprofitable social apps fetch valuations in the tens of billions of dollars, BlackBerry’s rumored $7.5 billion price feels almost quaint. Yes, the smartphone division is an unholy mess, but BlackBerry is rich on unique advantages whose value would be greatly amplified by being integrated into a larger company with broader operations. Imagine BBM preloaded on every Galaxy device, Blackberry Bridge on every Ativ laptop, BES on every corporate server, and QNX on literally everything. Samsung is the world’s most diverse manufacturer of things and BlackBerry has the pieces to make those things smarter, better connected, and more secure.",0.5608463666144582,0.4391536333855418,0.5196610193626269,997,5.4082246740220663,553,6.5533453887884265,0,0,"Business, Tech, BlackBerry, Report"

I've downloaded Pocket and the Kindle app, but anything longer than a quick news article just doesn't work for me on mobile. It's not the small screen, it's all of the distractions; with Twitter, email, and Puzzles & Dragons just a tap away, it's hard to concentrate on just one thing. That's why I have a Kindle Paperwhite and shelves full of actual, paper books: they only have one purpose, but they do it really well. When I want to read, I don't want to be distracted, and a multipurpose smartphone or tablet has too many temptations. It turns out the same is true for video games. With the continued growth of mobile games, many have predicted the eventual death of dedicated handheld gaming devices. And in some ways it's already happening: the 3DS isn't the dominant force it used to be, while the Vita is essentially on life support, with few notable games on the horizon. Why would anyone want to play a $40 game on a device that can only play video games, when you can grab a free game on your phone and also watch Netflix and read comic books? It's for the same reason I'm glad that the web browser on my Kindle is terrible: with a dedicated handheld, I can actually focus on only one thing. An unforgiving, immensely rewarding quest I realized this as I've been playing Etrian Odyssey 2 Untold: The Fafnir Knight on my 3DS. The upcoming game, which launches on August 4th, is the kind of deep, involved role playing experience that I just can't imagine playing on a phone. It's actually a remake of the original Etrian Odyssey II, and like the rest of the series it's an unforgiving, immensely rewarding quest that requires dedication. Unlike most RPGs, which send you out on a grand quest to save the world, Etrian Odyssey is almost entirely about exploring. You're presented with a massive, intimidating labyrinth made up of twisted paths and multiple floors, and the challenge is figuring out how to survive while still making your way through to see the end. The games barely even have a story (though the remakes add an optional story mode that includes a charming cast of characters to explore with); instead, the thrill is simply in exploring and seeing what surprises await you on the next floor.  Staying alive means being cautious — push too far without rest and you might not make it out — and mastering complex systems. You can harvest resources in the labyrinth, which can be used to cook helpful meals in town, or forge new items or gear. The Fafnir Knight even features a town-building aspect, where you can help improve businesses around town to earn more money, which can in turn be used to buy better weapons and armor. I've played for more than a dozen hours, and I'm still learning how many of these aspects work. I'm still learning how many of these aspects work Etrian Odyssey's defining characteristic is its maps. When you first venture into the labyrinth, it's undocumented territory; the only way to remember the layout is to actually draw a map using the bottom screen. Without that information, you will almost definitely find yourself lost and, eventually, dead. The labyrinth is full of short cuts and spots to rest and recharge, and if you don't know where they are you'll have a tough time advancing. It's also just incredibly satisfying to sketch the world as you explore; it's almost like a part of the world wouldn't exist if you didn't document it. This game could probably technically work on an iPad, but it wouldn't be the same. Much of the appeal of an Etrian Odyssey game, at least for me, is that it's completely absorbing, forcing me to pay attention to everything I do if I want any chance at success. I've probably spent more time reading the in-game bestiary than I have playing mobile games these past few weeks. And it's not just Etrian Odyssey: the games I'm finding myself drawn to on the 3DS the most are big, sprawling games that wouldn't feel right on a phone. When I pick up Xenoblade Chronicles 3D, I know I can settle in for the night in the same way as when I pick up a big book, and I'm looking forward to doing the same with Yo-kai Watch. The only real distraction is if I decide to play another game instead; just like the Kindle, the 3DS is built for a specific purpose, and playing games on it just feels right. Dedicated gaming handhelds have become a niche, but one that I hope stays around. I've got maps to draw.",0.3111638050112998,0.6888361949887002,0.16168410316776835,802,4.5598503740648377,411,5.7469586374695867,0,0,"Culture, Entertainment, Gaming, Essay"

You step on a subway platform, and you see them. You go to the gym, and you see them. You pass your mail carrier on your street, and you see them. Even in the face of that ubiquity, I'm still not sure what to call them — and I'm not alone. When we recently polled Verge readers on what to call these Bluetooth fashion crimes, the winning name was: ""I just like clicking buttons!"" (Thanks, Ross.) ""Neckbuds"" was a close second, and it's fun, so let's go with that. I wanted to hate neckbuds from the moment I saw them. Not just because of how they look, but because they’re a clumsy stopgap on the path to what I consider the ""real"" future: actual wireless earbuds. A handful of companies showed these off at CES in January, and I was so convinced that they would come to market this year that I wrote that on this website. (As of this post, I'm still waiting.) So when I first noticed a handful of people wearing neckbuds in the wild, two thoughts kept crossing my mind: ""These will never be popular,"" and ""I will never wear those."" I was wrong. In both ways, I completely missed the mark. I let cosmetic fear cloud my judgement about what wound up being a not-so-ludicrous and surprisingly pleasant product. But this is not because I've found myself suddenly okay with the idea of wearing a futuristic prison collar made by LG. It's because Samsung made the Level U, which is the best pair of neckbuds yet. They're not perfect, but they're worth the hassle The experience with Samsung's Level U, which is available for around $70, is far from perfect. None of the included earbuds fit comfortably in my ears, a problem I always seem to have. (I've made do with the ""active"" option — the ones with the extra rubber that pushes up against one of the folds in your ear.) Worse are the moments when the Bluetooth signal cuts out when my iPhone is deep in my pocket. But in a handful of situations, these are completely worth the hassle. The battery life is excellent, hovering somewhere around the advertised 10 hours. They pair quickly and easily with my phone. And considering my daily headphones are usually a pair of Sony MDR7506 studio headphones, the Level U neckbuds are an attractive option in the oppressive summer heat of New York City. They're great for working out because of how light they are, and I don't have to worry about tangling myself in a cord. More specifically, I love wearing them on my bike. I can load up Google Maps and a little bit of music, put these on, and go. Since I can never get a good seal with them, I can hear cars and other bikes around me while still listening to directions. They also don't make me work up any extra sweat, so I can just about forget that they're there. That's probably the best thing about the Level U neckbuds: you don't need to worry about how you look. The small, plastic horseshoe that you sling around your neck slips so comfortably under a shirt collar that, on a number of occasions, I forgot I had the whole thing on in the first place. And even if you don't have a collar to tuck them in, the Level U is by far the nicest pair of neckbuds that any company has made.   I know I shouldn't care about what people think of my appearance, and neither should you. But wearing a pair of neckbuds without worrying how you look doesn't get any easier just because that's true. For now, Samsung's made a pair that I really, truly like, and one that I will think twice about chucking in the garbage when I finally get my wireless earbuds.",0.644816393304924,0.355183606695076,0.16350542485962263,668,4.408682634730539,346,5.4132947976878611,0,0,"Tech, Editorial"

Now Verizon is clearing all of that up with a new blog post discussing what existing contract customers will and won't be able to do. Perhaps of greatest interest: Verizon says that these customers will still be able to renew their contracts and buy phones at subsidized prices. This means, for instance, that when a new iPhone comes out next month, Verizon customers who are eligible for a renewal will be able to buy it for $200.  Existing contract customers can basically keep doing their thing It's possible that Verizon will stop offering certain smartphones as part of its subsidy scheme in the future, therefore encouraging people to move over to its new off-contract plans, but it doesn't sound like that's happening for now. Verizon says that it'll let existing customers remain on their contract plans with the same terms for as long as they'd like — they can even add new lines — but once they switch to an off-contract plan, there's no going back. It's likely that existing customers won't be able to change their current plans very much either, although the blog doesn't comment beyond adding new lines. What all that adds up to is: existing contract customers can basically keep doing their thing; when they finally want to change something, they'll probably have to hop on over to one of Verizon's new off-contract plans. For the most part, that's nothing to fear. Though they have different pricing structures, there's probably even some benefit to going off-contract — not the least of which being that you can just stop paying Verizon whenever you want and move over to another carrier.

Razer is rolling out the new Nabu smartband, a $100 activity tracker with an OLED display. The ""Nabu"" name might not sound familiar to you — it doesn't have nearly the brand awareness that Fitbit or Jawbone do. If you do recognize it, you might be thinking, ""I thought the Nabu came out last year."" And you would be right: Razer announced the first Nabu band at CES 2014, and then later shipped the Nabu X, which we reviewed here. In the end, maybe the only thing the Nabu has to set itself apart from the Fitbits and Jawbones of the world is marketing. So Razer put together this video, which uses the Zombieland joke about rules for the zombie apocalypse. Honestly, it might be the best thing about the Nabu:  But back to the specs of the Nabu itself. The newest Nabu has been redesigned so that the main button is in a more intuitive place — next to the display instead of being integrated into it. The clasp is now magnetic and opens from the side, and the charging port has been moved. It has a rechargeable lithium-polymer battery that can last up to six days and is splashproof (not waterproof). Perhaps most interestingly, the new Nabu a contact sharing feature that lets you share your contact information with other Nabu and Nabu X wearers just by bumping wrists, something that a couple thousand gamers will get to try out for themselves this week at PAX Prime in Seattle. But the Nabu X also has that feature — so it's probably not worth the upgrade. As with many other activity-tracking wearables, the Nabu band syncs to a Nabu companion app that runs on both iOS and Android devices. This companion app shows daily activity logs as well as sleep patterns; the band itself will show notifications when paired via Bluetooth with your smartphone. Both the Nabu and the Nabu X will receive ""major updates"" through the app, the company says. Could this catch on with gamers? Sure. But it looks super similar to other wearables, aside from a couple things. And as wearables become commodities, incremental changes (like the placement of a button) and one stand-out feature might not be enough.

New York Supreme Court Justice Barbara Jaffe said that the apes, held at Stony Brook University for research purposes, are covered by a writ of habeas corpus — a basic legal principle that lets people challenge the validity of their detention. However, hours later, Jaffe amended her court order to remove the habeas corpus language, essentially reversing the earlier decision. The non-decision comes two years after the Nonhuman Rights Project, an animal rights group, brought legal cases in a bid to free four chimpanzees. The group said the animals — Hercules and Leo at Stony Brook university, and two others on private property — were being unlawfully imprisoned, and should be relocated to a sanctuary. Three lower court judges dismissed the cases as they were raised in 2013, but the Nonhuman Rights Project appealed, eventually convincing Jaffe that the animals were sufficiently intelligent to grant them what amounts to basic human rights — but only temporarily. The animal rights group wants the apes moved to a sanctuary Jaffe has ordered a Stony Brook representative to appear in court on May 6th to reply to the Nonhuman Rights Project's petition that the animals are being held unlawfully. It could be that the judge organized the hearing to listen to both sides of the case before making a decision, and will ultimately decide that Stony Brook can keep the apes — Richard Cupp, a law professor at California's Pepperdine University told Science it would be ""quite surprising"" if the judge made ""a momentous substantive finding"" that chimps were legally people without both parties being able to have their say. But Natalie Prosin, the Nonhuman Rights Project's executive director, said after the original decision that regardless of whether Hercules and Leo are afforded legal personhood after the hearing, the group intends to use the judge's ruling in future cases. ""We have scientific evidence to prove in a court of law that elephants, great apes, and whales and dolphins are autonomous beings and deserve the right to bodily liberty,"" she said.

Sometimes the two tenants have joint happy hours and the Burners help out with costumes. It's ""a good cultural match for us,"" Sarah Richardson, Pax's director of communications said during a recent visit to the company. ""They make us look conservative."" Richardson was sitting at a conference table puffing on Pax's newest product: a slim, rectangular e-cigarette called Juul. Seated around the table were the mechanical and electrical engineers behind Juul, including Pax's research scientist Chenyue Xing, who has a PhD in chemical engineering and experience with inhalation products. The key to smoker satisfaction is hitting peak nicotine five minutes in The small team has helped create what Pax Labs (formerly known as Ploom) is calling ""an intelligently engineered and intensely satisfying new vapor experience."" What makes it intelligent? ""That’s up for personal interpretation isn’t it? Just kidding,"" CEO James Monsees told me later, by phone.   In Monsees' interpretation, Juul is smarter than the competition because of its ability to mimic the satisfaction of smoking a regular ""combustion"" cigarette. The key to that buzz is a sharp peak of nicotine in the consumer's blood profile about five minutes after she takes her first puff. To recreate that spike, the team started with the chemistry of its liquid-nicotine cartridges, or ""Juulpods,"" which use nicotine salts, rather than ""free-base nicotine."" Using salts allowed Pax to increase the nicotine concentration from two percent to five percent without being unpalatable. Adding organic acids were also a key part to make inhaling smoother. It's not delivering more nicotine overall, it's delivering it in a more satisfying way, the team told me. ""Juulpods"" just rolls off the tongue The other differentiator that makes Juul smarter is temperature control, using what they called a precision resistance measurement circuit to figure out the ideal temperature for vaporization. ""When you’re able to control the temperature really well,"" said Monsees, the flavor doesn't change and you don't create degradation compounds that you don't want to inhale. Although tank-based e-cigarettes allow users to adjust the temperature, it's less controlled because the liquids and device are from different companies and changes depending on whether the user puffs faster or slower. To demonstrate Juul's precision in this area Ari Atkins, an R&D engineer, connected Juul to his Macbook, started inhaling, and the graph below appeared on the conference room screen.   Juul is definitely not for the keep vaping weird crowd, who care about customization, but I found Juul's design simple and intuitive. The disposable cartridges easily popped into the device. Each puff did seem standardized. Sure, I felt a little like an alien whipping it out at a bar, but a really minimalist alien. The device comes with a one-year warranty and uses a magnetic USB deck to recharge. It takes one hour to charge and that will last you for about one pod or 200 ""puffs per charge,"" the company says. To figure out whether it needs to be charged, you gently tap the device twice and a little light on the front glows red, yellow, or green. A really minimalist alien Consumers can purchase Juul starting June, 2015. Pax is selling the starter kit (the device, a multi-pack of Juulpods in four flavors, and a USB charger) for $49.99 and the 4-packs of the pods for $15.99. For novices or fans of clean design, it's less clunky than skeuomorphic devices like Njoys, which are built to look like a cigarette, and involves fewer parts than Blu's rechargeable model. Plus, there's no glowing light or specter of Jenny McCarthy.   Pax Labs recently released a new model of its vaporizer (happy belated 4/20, buddies). But it's a dicey time to get into the e-cig business. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) formally proposed regulations for e-cigarettes last April. According to The Hill, the FDA is unlikely to act before June, but academics and researchers aren't waiting around. In February, a study was published showing that exposing mice to e-cigarette vapor for just two weeks had damaged their immune system. For the study, they tested Njoy, one of the biggest brands in the market. The most alarming report came from a survey published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention last week, which found that e-cigarette usage was now more popular than cigarettes in middle and high schools. However as The New York Times pointed out, the shift could also suggest ""that some teenage smokers may be using e-cigarettes to quit."" E-cigarettes are more popular than cigarettes in high school While the data is being debated, officials like the California Department of Public Health, which put out the video below, are already campaigning over advertising e-cigarettes to kids.  Pax Labs is very careful not to make any claims about health or smoking cessation. Monsees is the first to acknowledge that his company has ""a vested interest"" in calling itself a healthier cigarette, and therefore should not be the one to analyze its own risks. E-cigs have been popular for the past five years, but the industry still doesn't have the kind of ""conclusive studies"" the agency requires for over-the-counter medications, food, or cosmetics, he said. ""All I can do is encourage regulators."" When I pressed Monsees about how Pax thinks of the issue, he called combustion cigarettes ""the most popular consumer product of all time that has known issues."" Pax's goal is to make ""compellingly better products."" ""The most popular consumer product of all time that has known issues""  Atkins, the R&D engineer, was a less diplomatic. ""We don’t think a lot about addiction here because we’re not trying to design a cessation product at all,"" he said, later noting ""anything about health is not on our mind,"" before his colleagues collectively winced. Atkins, who used to smoke close to half a pack of Marlborough Reds a day, may make a good poster boy for Juul regardless. While developing the product, ""I just realized one day that I hadn’t smoked cigarettes in a month,"" he said. Atkins didn’t think of it as quitting smoking, ""I just like it better.""     Addiction and obligation are issues that Silicon Valley would rather avoid. Filings with the Security and Exchange Commission from earlier this month show that Pax has been trying to raise $25 million in funding, but has only sold investors on $6.5 million so far. Companies sometimes file Form D's before the round has closed and Monsees would not disclose anything about ongoing funding efforts, but he did acknowledge that Sand Hill Road hasn’t welcomed him with open wallets. ""Venture firms are generally set up to invest in innovation, but the kind of innovation that comes out of the Valley, and we’re not exactly that."" Although he declined to share revenue, Monsees said Pax was in a ""growth phase"" and now ""well beyond"" the milestone of selling half a million Pax devices, which the company announced in February. Juul's name is supposed to be a play on the word jewel because Pax wanted to create something more lasting and precious than throwaway cigarettes. ""We didn't want to spell it the same because we like being different,"" said Monsees.

Since 1958, scientists have tracked the ebbing wolf population on Michigan's Isle Royale, an island in Lake Superior. Now the study is down to only three predators, and that number may reach zero by as early as next year, according to a report in Nature. When the study first began, the Isle Royale wolf population neared 50, but it has been declining for some time now. A decade ago there were just 30 wolves on the island, and a Nature report last year had that number down to ten. The last male wolf joined the pack in 1997 In the 1940s, three Canadian gray wolves walked across the ice on Lake Superior and found a home on Isle Royale, according to the National Parks Conservation Association. The population of moose already on the island made the animals' prey / predator relationship enticing to scientists. The last male wolf to join the pack was in 1997, and the researchers say the inbreeding has created problems, Nature reports. Originally, Rolf Peterson and John Vucetich, ecologists at Michigan Technological University, hoped to save the population by bringing new wolves onto the island whose dominant genes would mask faulty recessive genes. But Peterson and Vucetich say the National Parks Service dragged its heels when the researchers asked to introduce new wolves, and the period for ""genetic rescue"" has closed. ""We have science coming out our ears and it wasn’t enough to carry the day against an entrenched bureaucracy with a culture of non-intervention,"" Peterson told Nature.

""We’ve made real progress in reducing the impact of the things we control directly — our offices, retail stores, and products,"" Apple writes. ""But there’s still a lot of work to be done to reduce the carbon footprint of our supply chain. And it’s our responsibility to lead that effort."" The 2015 report, which covers Apple's 2014 fiscal year, shows Apple continuing to move closer to its goal of using entirely renewable energy to power its operations. All of Apple's US operations are now powered with renewable energy, and 87 percent of its global operations are now renewable. The weak link appears to be Apple's retail stores, as it says that all data centers and offices are already on renewable power.  Apple intends to get all of its paper from sustainable sources The other highlight in Apple's 2015 report is its new focus on reducing harmful usage of paper. It's working with The Conservation Fund, an environmental nonprofit, to begin sourcing product packaging from forests certified as being sustainably managed or controlled wood sources. In 2014, Apple says that 80 percent of the paper and cardboard used for packaging iPhones, iPads, iPods, Macs, and the Apple TV was sourced from responsible forests. Its goal is to reach 100 percent. Apple announced its partnership with The Conservation Fund last week, saying then that they were working together to protect ""over 36,000 acres of working forest."" Paper will still be sourced from those forests, but the intention is to do so in a way that allows the environment to thrive nonetheless — Apple says that it amounts to providing ""permanent environmental protection"" for those forests. ""For Apple, this is the beginning of a worldwide effort, one that represents a new approach as it reassesses its impact on the world’s paper supply chain,"" Lisa Jackson, Apple's environmental chief, wrote. The environmental impact report was released alongside a new video this morning, also speaking to Apple's commitments and progress on sustainability. Minimizing Apple's negative impacts on the environment has been an increasingly prominent goal under CEO Tim Cook, and videos like these show how Apple is packaging that focus into a product as much as anything that the company would sell. That's nothing to complain about: Apple's outspoken stance on climate change makes it a potentially strong ally for environmentalists to have on their side.

Unlike consumer-oriented genetic testing offered by 23andMe, Color  Genomics' test will be available only through health care providers. And  the company has genetic counselors available to help patients interpret  their results. It's a major challenge to Myriad's BRCA empire, at a  fraction of the cost, just as insurers begin to shy away from the bills for genetic testing. The gene variants BRCA1 and BRCA2 are among the best-known risk factors. Carriers of BRCA1 have an 80 percent risk of developing breast cancer and a 50 percent risk of ovarian cancer before the age of 80. Women with family histories of cancer — including, most publicly, Angelina Jolie and Masha Gessen — have written about taking the test, and choosing to receive preventive mastectomies, to dodge their genetic risks. The Supreme Court ruled two years ago that human genes can't be patentedMyriad has faced widespread criticism over the cost of its tests, though the company says that insurers typically pay the bulk of the expense. Color Genomics' test isn't going to be reimbursed by insurers, says Elad Gil, a co-founder of Color Genomics. That's why its price is so much lower — people have to be willing to pay for it on their own. Gil says that Color Genomics has lowered the costs by automating more processes, like taking a family history and working with variant interpretation. Color Genomics' test complies with the standards used by most makers of genetic tests. Color's test wouldn't be possible if the Supreme Court  hadn't ruled two years ago that Myriad couldn't hold exclusive rights to  BRCA testing because human genes can't be patented.

The primary method is still lethal injection Fallin and other supporters of the procedure say it's pain-free and effective, noting that the nitrogen would render inmates unconscious within ten seconds and kill them in minutes. It's also cheap: state representatives say the method only requires a nitrogen tank and a gas mask, but financial analysts say its impossible to give precise figures, the Post reports. Oklahoma's primary execution method is still lethal injection, but the state's procedure is currently under review by the Supreme Court. Earlier this week, Tennessee suspended executions statewide following challenges to its own lethal injection protocol. The new bill accounts for the possibility that, even if lethal injection is ruled constitutional, the drugs necessary to perform the procedure may still be unavailable. Ohio recently suspended all of its 2015 executions while it attempts to restock its supply of lethal injection drugs. Last month, the largest group of pharmacists in the US urged its members to refrain from providing prisons with the chemicals used in lethal injections. If Oklahoma cannot use lethal injection for capital punishment, it will turn to the nitrogen method, followed by the electric chair and finally a firing squad if the previous options fail. There are no previous records of a formal nitrogen gas execution, the Post reports. Opponents of the nitrogen hypoxia bill say no execution is truly painless, and that this decision was rushed through in an effort to pass a law before the Supreme Court's ruling later this month.

Drive an hour in another direction, and you can pay for sex, legally. But if what helps you relax is a prescribed dose of medicinal marijuana, you’re out of luck.  Despite being legalized over 15 years ago in Nevada, medicinal marijuana is still largely unavailable. There’s plenty of demand; the issue is supply. Opening a medical marijuana dispensary in Las Vegas is nearly as difficult as breaking ground on a new casino. Applicants need to attend countless hearings and have enough money to prove opening a storefront to be viable, a powerful attorney, state and city approvals, and zero demerits that could compromise their perceived integrity. A couple city council connections help, too.  The five women who are now establishing Desert Aire Wellness — what could be the first all-women-run marijuana dispensary in the state — had none of that. They met less than a year ago at City Hall public forums, each driven to launch the business for their own personal reasons. In order to compete for a highly coveted license,  they needed a seat at the table, and to do that, they needed to come together and put down all their chips.    Jay Brown, on the other hand, was less convinced. Susan Lera, one of the company’s founders, recently recalled Brown’s final words before they handed him the check: ""He looked at us and said, ‘Ladies, you have a snowball’s chance in hell to get a dispensary.’"" Susan Lera has a history in horticulture. Raised in Las Vegas, she cut her teeth as a landscape designer, which she says landed her appearances in a handful of magazines and on HGTV. Lera met Paula Newman, a fellow Desert Aire co-founder, roughly 15 years ago while landscaping her home. Lera and Newman have since changed careers a few times, occasionally working together. They identify as entrepreneurs, people open to opportunity when it presents itself.  Both women were in sales in January 2014, Lera at Hilton and Newman at a timeshare company, when they began to notice a surge of local news stories about the marijuana dispensary licenses that would be awarded later that year. Chewing on the possibility, the duo imagined a dispensary akin to an alternative medicine pharmacy, a place that would provide a safe and informative environment where the people who didn’t normally consider medicinal marijuana an option — parents, the elderly — could educate themselves on the substance’s properties. A marijuana dispensary for people unfamiliar with or scared of marijuana In themselves they saw the type of client they’d like to serve: Lera, whose eight-year-old son is autistic, is particularly interested in the health properties of cannabis, viewing it as a natural alternative to medicines like Ritalin that she doesn’t wish to give her child. Newman has hopes for the tinctures and oils helping her mother, who is in her 90s and suffers from glaucoma and its associated pains. Lera and Newman attended local meetings, originally out of curiosity. Was the plan viable? What would it cost? Where could they open? After one of these meetings, they met Brenda Gunsallus, who’d flown in from North Carolina. They found in her a kindred spirit and new business partner, another entrepreneur with limited wealth and contacts, but a surplus of hope and passion. Gunsallus invited two more friends from her home state, Darlene Davis and Stacey Huffman, rounding out the group. Pursuing a dispensary license, of which only 18 would be given for the initial round of openings in Clark County, would pit them in competition against dozens of wealthy, high-powered, politically established applicants — mostly men — not just from Las Vegas, but the entire country. They decided that being a group entirely comprised of women would work to their advantage. ""Honestly,"" says Lera, ""we were thinking maybe, heck, that can help [put us] at the top — being all women. We were doing research and found out women were uncomfortable going to the dispensaries, either because of the location, or that they were intimidating. We thought [we] could gear [our company] towards women and make it more comfortable for [them]."" ""I think if a person walks into a place run by women,"" says Newman, ""I’m hoping our gentler side, our maternal side, our sister side, and our auntie side will be able to sit down with people who are afraid… and to be able to choose an oil or a tincture, not roll a doobie and get high."" Legal marijuana has floundered in Las Vegas despite the city’s reputation as a libertarian playground. Despite medical marijuana being legalized by the public vote in 1998 and amended into the state constitution in 2000, the city and the state have been slow to take measures that would allow the sale and possession of the drug. Medicinal legalization took effect in October 2001, but was immediately crippled. For over a decade, qualifying patients were limited to possession of 2.5 ounces and 12 plants. Dispensaries were forbidden, so card holders had to cultivate their own supply. To this day, a first offense possession of up to an ounce of marijuana — without a medical license — warrants a $600 fine and the label misdemeanor. Get caught carrying over 2 ounces on a second offense, and face up to four years of jail time. With progress came setbacks. In October 2009, the Justice Department announced that people who use or distribute marijuana for medical purposes should not face federal prosecution, spurring a number of dispensaries to open in Nevada in 2010. They were subsequently raided by federal agents. For every step forward, marijuana leniency took two steps back   Not until 2012 did a Clark County district judge declare Nevada’s prevention of marijuana dispensaries unconstitutional. But that same year, state police arrested or gave citations for 8,500 marijuana-related crimes. According to the Marijuana Policy Project, 85 percent of those incidents were for marijuana possession. Remember, the state’s citizens voted the legalization of possession and sale of medical marijuana into their own state constitution, not once, but twice over a decade prior. For comparison’s sake, consider that the state of Colorado approved medical marijuana at the same time as Nevada. Colorado has since legalized recreational pot, and last year made $53 million in tax revenue, part of which is now being used to build public schools and staff health and wellness professionals. With the marijuana industry making positive inroads in other states, now, 15 years after the state’s original legalization amendment, marijuana is coming to  Nevada — and rapidly. In 2015, after 14 years of politicking, marijuana dispensaries will finally open across the state. Opening Desert Aire Wellness is a risky venture: the blunt cost to open a shop is staggering. According to Lera, the earliest budget estimates — including licensing, floor plan, and a full remodel — would cost over $300,000, not including purchases from vendors, payroll, and other minor costs. Nor did it include legal fees. That’s where Jay Brown, the initial $100,000 fee, and the snowball melting in hell enter the scene. The $100,000 fee, delivered in full to a single attorney, reads like a red flag, and with reason. Jay Brown has a reputation in Las Vegas. A former co-worker of ex-Vegas Mayor Oscar Goodman, Brown is best known for his capabilities as a lobbyist. When the women met in his office, Brown encouraged them to think seriously about not pursuing the dispensary. He said he discouraged them on their second visit. And their third visit. Brown explained that he had already signed as council for at least one other client hoping to win a dispensary license. (According to a report by The Las Vegas Sun, Brown represented seven different clients in the matter.) At best, he told them, they would get a license to cultivate marijuana — plenty of applications do. The shop alone would cost $300,000 The group  reconsidered taking Brown on time and again, but there was no way around the truth. They needed Brown’s political connections and affiliation with the gaming or liquor businesses. Brown was the closest they had. And his price was fixed. After their fifth visit with Brown, they knew what they had to do. ""I was physically ill,"" says Paula Newman, ""but the reason we went to him is because we know for a fact that he’s a good lobbyist. And he’s a person that’s been in this town for many, many years. You get what you pay for, and I’ve always been a believer of that. I figured the only chance we were going to have was to start with someone who has the best angles, and the best reputation of talking us up. Because we’re nobodies. We’re the peons. And I’m not ashamed to say it."" ""Talk about Vegas,"" says Lera, ""it was the biggest gamble for all of us. We took so many notes from everybody. We were like, well, we’re already in it, let’s go forward and do the best application we can do.""   Desert Aire’s application was its best weapon — other than its high-powered lawyer. When  state requirements mention an employee manual to be created in the future, the group wrote the entire employee manual in advance, including it with their submission. The final application spanned thousands of pages, requiring multiple 4-inch binders. Eighteen slots were open for Vegas-area dispensaries in theory, but many would immediately be claimed by shoe-ins: the Nevada Wellness Center was founded by Frank Hawkins, a former NFL running back, Las Vegas city council member, and board member of the Las Vegas Housing Authority (Hawkins is also currently the president of Las Vegas’ NAACP branch, and develops housing in low-income neighborhoods). Other winning applicants at the state approval level include the Irvine, California-based CEO of Terra Tech, an established member of the medical marijuana industry, and NuLeaf, a company whose investors include local legislative lobbyist, John Sande III. According to a June 2014 report by The Las Vegas Sun, after the Clark County Commissioners signaled  medical marijuana dispensaries would open in March of the same year, three of those commissioners received campaign contributions ""22 times for a total of $56,900. Nearly 40 percent of that came from investors in a single venture, CW Nevada."" In a report by The Las Vegas Sun, commissioners claimed contributions would have no impact on their decision. It’s unclear if CW Nevada secured a license, as the company has not consented to have its identity released on the list of provisional license holders. Desert Aire Wellness didn't have famous athletes or politicians on its side Without political cache or cash to compete, in October 2014, Desert Aire Wellness, under the advice of their councilman, Bob Coffin, and their attorney, Jay Brown, pulled it’s application. By pulling the application without prejudice, Coffin explained, they would have a better chance at a dispensary license in the next round of applications — whenever that might happen. For a week, it seemed they’d rolled snake eyes and lost big time. Then the unexpected happened. Days after resigning from Clark County’s application process, the state of Nevada awarded its own approval for dispensary licenses — and Desert Aire Wellness was among them. On December 17th, Desert Aire Wellness, allowed to resubmit their local application, finally received approval from Clark County, clearing the final hurdle to opening the business. Lera remembers calling their lawyer: ""I said Jay, hell just called and said the snowball arrived."" A short drive off the strip, near the Las Vegas Convention Center — where each January the tech community meets for CES — sits a small shop that will be transformed into Desert Aire Wellness. The roof needs replacement, and the facade begs for fresh paint, but soon locals and tourists, with the right prescription, will be able to visit 420 E. Sahara Ave — yes, 420 — and purchase legal medicinal marijuana. They break ground today, on April 20th — yes, 420 again. Breaking ground on 4/20 at 420 E. Sahara Avenue Foot traffic will be a trickle, at first. As of a year ago, only 3,473 people carried medical marijuana cards in Clark County, with roughly 5,000 in the entirety of Nevada. The hope among Desert Aire’s owners is that the number of cardholders will increase as more dispensaries open, and will radically surge if recreational marijuana is legalized in the state in 2016. In December 2014, Nevada’s Secretary of State Ross Miller announced the Initiative to Tax and Regulate Marijuana had received enough signatures from Nevada citizens to appear on the ballot in November 2016. This month, the Nevada legislature also has the choice to adopt the measure into law. Opening a dispensary is expensive and not immediately lucrative, but the long-term play is undeniable. The people who open medical pot shops this year will have a head start on a market that will almost certainly skyrocket within the decade. The odds are greater than anything offered in the casinos just down the street.    ""[The elderly] grew up in a culture back then where marijuana was bad,"" says Newman. ""It was devil weed back then. My job is not to shove anything down anyone's throat, but it’s to empower them with knowledge. At least they know they have something in their arsenal that they can try that might be able to alleviate some of their suffering and enrich their lives. ""It’s about teaching people, and then after they’re taught, they can make an informed decision as to what they think would be best for them, their family, their children, their parents."" Lera says Desert Aire Wellness should open in late June, around the time the state has finished the legal work that will allow for a steady supplied stock of medical marijuana at local shops. If their shop improves the lives of local families, the company’s big bet will have paid off.",0.6357138562188254,0.36428614378117463,0.8772047598134555,2371,4.9881906368620834,1072,6.3759328358208958,0,10,"Culture, Policy & Law, Science, US & World, Features"

Prior to 2000, examiners gave flawed testimony that may have helped prosecutors in more than 95 percent of 268 trials, according to the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers and the Innocence Project, both of which have been helping the government conduct the largest review of post-conviction forensic evidence in the US to date. Flawed testimony in 95 percent of cases ""The FBI’s three-decade use of microscopic hair analysis to incriminate defendants was a complete disaster,"" Peter Neufeld, co-founder of the Innocence Project, told The Washington Post. ""We need an exhaustive investigation that looks at how the FBI, state governments that relied on examiners trained by the FBI, and the courts allowed this to happen and why it wasn’t stopped much sooner."" FBI examiners systematically told the court that the visual hair matches made in their labs were near-certain, according to The Washington Post. Moreover, they used misleading statistics to support their testimonies, despite the fact that there is no research that shows how often hair from different people can look the same. Today, forensic scientists tend to use visual hair comparison to rule out possible suspects instead of using it as evidence for guilt. And when they do use it as evidence for guilt, they combine it with genetic testing. The FBI's admission doesn't mean that there was no other evidence supporting the convictions, but it does raise questions about whether some people have been wrongfully incarcerated. After all, this has happened before. In 2002, the FBI reported that more than 11 percent of hair matches made by its examiners were false. As a result, five defendants have been exonerated since 2009; they had all served 20 to 30 years in prison for murder or rape. No written standards explaining how examiners should define results The announcement highlights a massive failure of forensic science — a science that, in some cases, has had to battle claims that it's no more than ""junk science."" But a lot of questions remain. We still don't know why these errors occurred because the FBI wants to complete all the reviews before assessing the causes. Still, the agency has admitted that examiners in this unit didn't have written standards explaining exactly how they should define forensic match results in court until 2012. And the microscopic hair comparison unit is actually ahead of the curve. Nineteen other forensic disciplines lack these standards, according to the FBI. The agency plans to change that this year.",0.3487663346095683,0.6512336653904317,0.8558170161180136,445,5.2179775280898877,254,5.9448818897637796,0,0,"Policy & Law, Science, US & World"

Building off Elon Musk's freely available designs, the crowdfunded company has staked out a five-mile stretch of Quay Valley adjacent to California's Interstate 5 freeway as a place where the innovative transportation system can be deployed. If successful, it would be the first full-size implementation of Musk's ideas, published in August 2013.

Musk is already building his own Hyperloop test track in Texas, but HTT says Musk's track is a scaled-down model, allowing for easier testing of the physics involved. HTT's track will be designed for human passengers, testing the passenger systems, but will come with other limitations. With only five miles of track, the craft will top out at just 200mph rather than the 760mph predicted in Musk's initial documents. ""It's not about speed,"" Ahlborn told The Verge. ""There are a lot of other things that need to be optimized.""  The proposed route in Quay Valley. Quay Valley is an unusual home for the project.

The current plans project 25,000 housing units alongside hotels, restaurants, and a business park, spread across 7,500 acres in California's central valley. The proposed Hyperloop would be designed as a functioning (albeit limited) mass transit system for the town, charging residents for rides and providing a revenue stream for HTT. The other big question is funding. HTT is looking to raise $100 million to build the test track (the full version is projected to cost between $7 and $16 billion), and the company is exploring unconventional fundraising methods to do so. Thus far, all of HTT's funding has come from equity-backed crowdfunding on JumpStartFund, enticing early backers with a share in future revenues. But $100 million is out of the reach of JumpStartFund, and the same structure rules out VC funding, so for this round, Ahlborn is planning an IPO under an open auction model — a bold move for a company with no revenue stream as yet.

These vehicles are pretty much running throughout the day, says Wright, burning up fuel and money. Converting them means that any savings on running costs and maintenance provided by electric innards are recouped much quicker than with regular cars. A family car burns 600 gallons of fuel a year — a garbage truck uses 14,000 gallons ""Consumer automobiles don’t burn enough fuel,"" Wright explains to Quartz. ""Family cars burn about 600 gallons a year. If you make that [car] electric you are going to add $15,000, at least, to the cost of that car and maybe only save $1,500 [in fuel]. So maybe a 10-year payback. If you go to garbage trucks they are burning maybe 14,000 gallons a year, so you can save $35,000 in fuel and $20,000 in maintenance."" Wrightspeed's pitch is already attracting business, with the company securing its first significant deal with FedEx last year to convert 25 delivery trucks. Wright has said that both delivery trucks and garbage trucks make ideal candidates for his powertrains as not only are the vehicles in constant use, but their frequent braking can be used to generate more power for the electric batteries. An additional onboard microturbine that runs on diesel or different types of gas means the trucks will never run out of juice. Wright says that what Tesla has done to improve the public image of the electric vehicle is ""totally awesome,"" but he thinks that it's his technology that will actually lead to the adoption of more electric vehicles. ""The systems are not cheap,"" he tells Fast Company, ""but we save enough fuel and enough maintenance that they pay for themselves in a short enough time that it becomes a no brainer.

The course itself is almost rectangular in nature and rings the outskirts of Battersea Park on the River Thames. The action on the course's many high-speed straightaways and bends will be routinely interrupted by a number of chicanes and braking zones. Though the layouts have varied, each race in Formula E's first season has taken place on a street course like this. These types of courses are typically shorter than an official race track, and tend to offer closer (and therefore more thrilling) racing.   Formula E is a unique series in a number of ways. It's the first major motorsport run completely on electric engines, which means the cars produce little more than a high-pitched whine as they zip around the street courses. (That's a major point of contention for long-time motorsport fans, for whom the roar of combustion engines is held in holy regard.) It also features a ""fan boost"" component, where votes cast online give three drivers a momentary horsepower boost each race. The series is a testing ground for electric vehicles Formula E is just as much an electric vehicle testing ground as it is a racing series, and is especially focused on the development of better battery technology. The high-performance cars can make it through about half a race (25-30 minutes) on one battery, and instead of swapping in a new one the drivers have to pull into the pits and jump into a second car to finish the race. The scheduling change is far from the first that Formula E has endured in its debut season. Earlier this month, a race in Moscow was announced for the first week of June, replacing Rio de Janeiro on the schedule. That race, along with a proposed event in Hong Kong, was called off due to hesitance from the local governments.

The race circuit Martens mentions is a reference to Audi's high-speed autonomous run at Hockenheimring last year in a specially-equipped RS7; the ""living room on four wheels"" refers to the self-driving F 015 concept that Mercedes unveiled at CES in January. Neither company has specifically committed to a real-world test of a fully autonomous car by end users, however. Volvo is working with the city of Gothenburg for the 2017 pilot program, and therein lies one of the biggest challenges that self-driving cars face: the development of the underlying technology is at serious risk of outpacing government regulation to manage it.

Swiss photographer Daniel Boschung created the series Face Cartography by using a robot to take high-megapixel pictures of peoples' faces, blowing up their features to striking detail. While macro photography like this isn't new, Boschung is slightly more removed from the process because he uses an ABB industrial robot with an attached Canon EOS Mark ll camera and a 180mm macro lens to capture hundreds of single shots of each subject. The final images are composites of those single shots, creating stunning photos with 900 million pixels. While facial details are heightened, emotions are noticeably lacking from the images. ""Emotions show up only briefly while macro photography takes half an hour,"" Boschung explains on his website. ""The person has to stay motionless while being photographed by the robot."" The photos break down each face, turning wrinkles, eyebrows, beards, and other features into removed, almost unrecognizable objects. Boschung seems to have an affinity for macro photography, using similar methods to take detailed photos of insects and paintings.

No, not the rock and roll machine hugging the wall at your local dive bar, but the digital music players we all used to manage MP3s back in the late 2000s. There was Winamp, Musicmatch Jukebox, and later iTunes. These apps listed your library of songs track by track and often featured big, visible play / pause / forward buttons that emulated the look of a car dashboard. They all seemed to agree that this is how your music should look. In the age of streaming music, meanwhile, Spotify has seemingly taken the lead. Part of its appeal has always been in its no-frills, familiar jukebox interface which made streaming music as easy as using iTunes. But as of late, Spotify has looked a bit archaic, a relic of the post-Napster era where ""click to play"" was a killer feature. Today, Spotify is rolling out perhaps its biggest design update ever for web, iPhone, Android, and Mac — a revamp which draws liberally from competitors like Rdio while establishing one identity across platforms for the first time. Spotify is finally moving beyond the jukebox.   The update adds handsome Proxima Nova type, rounded iconography and buttons to reflect the company's new-ish logo, large photos on artist pages, and a dark color scheme that accentuates important areas (like play buttons) with Spotify's trademark green. The service also now uses circular avatars to represent people and square avatars to represent albums. No longer is every Spotify page just a list of tracks. ""This is the first redesign this big that we've done,"" says Michelle Kadir, Spotify's director of product development. ""We've done bits and pieces along the way and launched on new platforms, but this is the first we've done of the whole service since the beginning."" Spotify's new design uses circles to denote artists and squares to denote albums If Spotify's new design looks familiar, that's probably because the company publicly tests most of the software and visual updates in its desktop apps before rolling them out to the masses. Today's update brings Spotify's new design to everyone, and more importantly to mobile — a domain where Spotify has traditionally iterated slowly. Spotify's new mobile app looks nothing like the old one with its dark new color scheme, Rdio-esque frosted glass, and an emboldened free shuffle feature which the company introduced last January to reel in new users. New Spotify for iPhone and desktop screenshotsPreviousNextView full GalleryPreviousNext Perhaps more importantly, Spotify's latest visual redesign brings with it one of the company's most requested features: a ""collection"" view to manage your music. The company in fact announced such a feature back in December 2012, but had failed to come through on delivering it. Now called ""Your Music,"" the new section inside the Spotify sidebar lets you save albums, songs, and artists without needing to create playlists. The feature is particularly useful on mobile, where navigating an epic list of playlists can get tiring. You can now choose to save specific artists or albums for offline listening. Spotify looks more than ever like a darker shade of chief competitor Rdio Today's update has notably killed Spotify's popular ""star"" buttons, which let you instantly save tracks to your Starred playlist. ""We no longer want to promote Starred for quick-saving but rather transition its usage to curation of your favorite music,"" says Kadir. ""We'll do this by removing the Star action and treating Starred as a normal playlist — you add songs to it as you would with any other playlist."" Unfortunately, without its famous yellow stars (and with the addition of a few prominent design cues), the app looks more than ever like a darker shade of chief competitor Rdio — but that might not be such a bad thing for Spotify. The company has grown into an Apple-esque behemoth, sucking up the best ideas around it one by one. For Rdio, distinguishing itself from larger competitors like Spotify will seemingly get even harder. The site's ""Your Music"" view was one of its most valuable selling points — and now Spotify has grabbed the feature wholesale along with its name. Despite its various inspirations from Rdio to Android's ""Holo"" interface, the latest version of Spotify feels like the best Spotify ever. ""The Swedish word lagom doesn't have a good equivalent in English, but it means 'perfect balance' — not too much not too little,"" says Spotify designer Andreas Holmström, ""and this is definitely reflected in the new Spotify.""

According to Washingtonian, Comcast previously kept a ""VIP"" list of customers in Montgomery County, Maryland, which borders DC. The list, made as late as 2005, reportedly included local government officials, business leaders, and a congressional field office — though no actual members of Congress. A separate list was made of the area's top-paying customers. Both lists were maintained by Comcast's Potomac office. It's unclear if the practice extended to other offices or continues today.  Comcast says it never gave special service to lawmakers In a statement to Washingtonian, Comcast once again denied that it has ever given special treatment to these VIPs. ""Comcast does not and has not offered special service, perks, or free upgrades to lawmakers or public officials,"" a spokesperson says. There's no proof that it has — Washingtonian reported last month that Comcast gives priority service to the elite, but that may be part of a broader program that incidentally helps, without explicitly targeting, officials and public figures. Still, the existence of a VIP list only emphasizes the general concern surrounding Comcast's interactions with lawmakers. The company has incredible power over how we access the internet and is currently trying to merge with Time Warner Cable, potentially creating a single giant towering over the entire industry. So why did Comcast keep a list of VIPs that happened to include government officials? Comcast would like us to think that it's all in the course of standard business, but it isn't saying much beyond that.

Level, an elegant but slow-growing app for tracking your spending, has been acquired by Capital One, the companies said today. The app, which was a favorite of ours when it launched in 2013, monitors your purchases and tells you how much you can spend each day without overdrawing your account. Capital One, which started as a credit-card company but has growing ambitions as a bank, says Level will help it build products geared toward a younger generation. (The deal price was not disclosed.) I’m a big fan of Level — I use it to track how much I spend on ride-sharing services every month, among other things. And it fills a niche: most official bank apps are ugly, hard to use, and siloed — they don’t give you a sense of your overall financial health. That’s why my visceral reaction to learning Level had been acquired was despair. Mint, the best-designed personal finance app of a previous generation, languished after being purchased by Intuit. Mint was fairly well established when it was bought; Level, by contrast, felt like it was only getting started. But Level, which had raised $5 million from Kleiner Perkins and others, likely wasn’t growing fast enough to remain independent: it had only 700,000 downloads to date, and no revenues. Level likely wasn't growing fast enough to stay independent  The good news is that, for now, Level will continue to be actively developed, and you can still sign in accounts with all the banks it currently supports. Capital One acquired the whole 11-person team and will allow them to remain working in San Francisco, where Capital One has an office with 100 people and plans to expand. ""The Level product will only get better,"" says Jake Fuentes, Level’s co-founder and CEO. ""We have a mandate from Capital One to build this into the next-generation banking experience we know it can be. We have access to resources at Capital One at a scale that we can really only dream of as a small company."" ""The Level product will only get better."" Level’s product roadmap includes letting users move money around inside the app, and creating new features to encourage saving, Fuentes says. But then, every startup is optimistic about the future on the day they’re acquired. Angie Moody, Capital One’s vice president for product development, says the company is making a big push into digital services. It bought the online bank ING Direct in 2012; more recently, it acquired the digital design and user experience firm Adaptive Path. The acquisitions ""have really positioned us to be more of a tech company than a traditional bank company,"" she says. I hope that’s true, because a traditional bank company would stifle any tech company it bought under crushing layers of bureaucracy, sending the founders scrambling for the exits as soon as their stock vests. Level is useful, well-designed, and has some good ideas for helping people manage their money. Here’s to hoping it’s the rare startup that thrives after being acquired.

Though the two-year-old company is profitable, it very much needs to take on the additional funding in order to expand its operations. Orders of Soylent have been subject to notoriously long delays, which is why the company plans ""first and foremost"" to use this money to improve its manufacturing. Soylent says that it's already making progress on that front, adding two new manufacturers that will allow it to produce 50 times more of its food powder than it currently has the capacity to. The goal is to eventually be able to ship out purchases immediately, but Soylent will have to get through its pending orders first.  ""In time Soylent will be synthesized directly from light, water, and air with designer microorganisms."" This is a long way to come for Soylent, which launched with a crowdfunding campaign nearly two years ago. The company makes a powder that you mix with oil to create a smoothie-like concoction that tastes a little bit like cake batter and is supposed to have all of the nutrients you need for a healthy diet. Soylent has made adjustments to its recipe since launch, most notably to reduce ""digestive issues"" that many initially complained of. Andreessen Horowitz led the funding round, which is the first in the multimillions for Soylent. Chris Dixon, a general partner at the firm, says that Soylent also plans to invest in further research and development, including working on improvements to the current formula and on new products. The plan is also to ""dramatically"" reduce the price of Soylent. It currently sells for $3 for a meal's worth of powder, but the company wants to get it down to ""a fraction of that."" As for why Dixon thinks Soylent will succeed, he points to the company's community — it supports a DIY forum of enthusiasts who make their own Soylent-like powders, and Dixon thinks that a community like that is difficult to replicate and will spread the word without requiring Soylent to spend money on marketing. Soylent CEO Rob Rhinehart doesn't elaborate much on the funding, but he has written a lengthy blog post / manifesto about the future of food. He says that the ""dream"" is for Soylent to eventually be ""so useful it is taken for granted, like tap water or climate control."" He imagines that kitchens will eventually disappear from the world as we improve automation and efficiency: The future of food is not the return to an agrarian society but the transcendence of it. In time Soylent will be synthesized directly from light, water, and air with designer microorganisms. Genetic engineering to enhance our microbiome, and eventually ourselves. I don’t know who was the first farmer, but I want to be the last. We will make food so cheap only the rich will cook. All of which will take more than $20 million and a weird smoothie, but that's where Soylent's trying to go.

Alibaba Pictures will use ""cloud computing and big data technologies"" to reach viewers Over the past year or so, traditional tech companies have been diving headfirst into the content game, trying to produce their own movies and TV shows to varying degrees of success. Watching a giant like Amazon flail about for a while has shown how difficult stepping into an established industry can be — but it's also shown how rewarding it can be for a company that's willing to invest in respected names. Netflix realized that first, finding big success with David Fincher and Kevin Spacey in House of Cards, and Amazon finally received some validation last night at the Golden Globes, when its series Transparent won best TV comedy or musical. Alibaba is very much playing the same game as Amazon: creating exclusive content that it already has the infrastructure to distribute and that it can simultaneously use to bolster its existing services. In a statement, Zhang Qiang, CEO of Alibaba Pictures, touts Alibaba's ability to take advantage of ""cloud computing and big data technologies"" to find viewers and put its creations in front of them. And like Amazon and Netflix, that tech is also going to be used to help Alibaba determine what types of entertainment is should make next. Alibaba's expansion into film is not as strange as it may first sound. Though the company may be known for e-commerce, it also has businesses in shipping, cloud services, payment processing, gaming, and more. Alibaba has already found that getting into film is not going to be cheap — but, if successful, it'll bring respectability and help it encroach on a lucrative industry that hasn't entirely figured out the internet yet.

This is his firsthand account of the enormous tragedy locals face after the devastating earthquake on April 25th. Pashupatinath Temple is a place connected to death and mourning in ways that are unlike anything in the Western world. Hindus have for years traveled to Pashupatinath to place their loved ones on funeral pyres and grieve in front of tourists and onlookers, a spectacle that couldn’t be any different from a funeral in the United States. The temple complex straddles both banks of the Bagmati River near the center of Kathmandu, Nepal’s capital. On one of its banks are the stone platforms where the funeral pyres burn; on the other is a viewing area. The 1,500-year-old temple complex is sacred to Nepal’s 23 million Hindus. It is one of the world’s best-known sites for cremations, performing them along the banks of the river. Now, as the death toll from Nepal’s earthquake continues to climb — estimated now to be near 5,000 — the temple is struggling to keep up with the surging number of bodies coming in.     As of Monday, Pashupatinath’s staff had performed 286 cremations since Saturday’s quake, and many more are scheduled, according to a report in The Washington Post. Because so many of the dead and bereaved are arriving at the temple from around the country, Pashupatinath has become a place where the enormity of the nation’s suffering and sense of loss is concentrated and in full public view. I’ve been traveling in Nepal as a tourist for more than a month. I first visited Pashupatinath in early April; during a second visit Tuesday, I noticed dramatic differences. On the first tour, I saw three cremations started over a period of 90 minutes, while onlookers snapped pictures from the viewing area and children played on the hills above. On Tuesday, I saw only anguish: all the platforms held burning bodies as dozens of women sobbed. Some were trying to hold a crying woman upright. Nearby, corpses swaddled in white cloth lie on the ground. Some people were even stacking wood to build their own fires downriver. ""We don’t know what to say about the world,"" said Harikrishna Thakuri, 31. ""We don’t know why God is cheating us, all the bad things happening in Nepal now."" Thakuri spoke as he stood just a few feet from where the body of Laxmi Thakuri, his aunt, was being consumed by flames. Laxmi, a housekeeper, was killed in Kathmandu’s Durbar Square area after being struck by falling debris on her way to work. Harikrishna says his aunt had departed the home of relatives only 10 minutes before the earthquake hit. On the viewing side of the river, I noticed a large crowd had gathered. When I crossed to take a look, I saw people trying to comprehend a cruel equation: one family, six bodies.     The bodies were lying side by side, covered by flower petals strung together. One of the victims' sons rested his forehead at the feet of his father. Even for a people who are familiar with civil war and have seen entire villages swept away in landslides and avalanches, the sight of a family's tragedy is overwhelming. Many weep. The six victims died when the earthquake toppled the 200-foot Dharahara Tower, among Kathmandu’s biggest tourist draws, according to Mohan Limbu, 30, one of the victims’ relatives. The tower has become a media symbol for the disaster. Among the dead was Limbu’s 23-year-old female cousin and an aunt and uncle who were both in their early 40s, he said. In a tragic twist, while the world was glued to TV video of the destroyed tower, Limbu and his surviving family members had no idea that the six were there. ""They went sightseeing, but we didn’t know where,"" said Limbu, a teacher. ""We called and called each of them, but nobody answered. Someone  picked up on Sunday, but it was a policeman."" I couldn’t help noticing that the bodies of the six victims seemed to be carefully prepared for cremation, but many others were not. During my first Pashupatinath tour, all three men were neatly covered; great care was spent on their religious rites. On Tuesday, limbs stuck out from under pyre logs. Flies swarmed. I saw trucks driving into one of the complex’s side entrances with bodies loaded on the roof. I wondered if these sorts of images were hard on relatives. And the work is far from done: four days after the quake, Nepal’s government has yet to recover corpses still buried in the rubble of collapsed buildings.     On Tuesday, I had to gird myself while watching the cremation of 15-year-old Milan Bhandari, who had dreams of becoming a doctor but was killed when his family home collapsed, according to relatives. It was hard to speak or make eye contact with the sons of Laxmi Thakuri, the woman who died in Durbar Square, while their mother’s body burned just a few feet away. The face of one of the boys appeared tear-stained; the expression on his face made me think he might be scared and confused. I wondered how many other of Nepal’s children were at the same moment trying to understand the concept of death. Fortunately, there are signs now that the government is moving in the right direction. One of the most encouraging developments came Tuesday night when the power returned. On Wednesday, the sound of merchants lifting metal shutters from their storefronts woke me up. People began shoveling debris. That’s when I remembered that the Nepalese are famous for their ability to endure. The Sherpa, the ethnic group from Nepal’s Himalayas region, are some of the world’s most famous mountaineers, celebrated for shouldering heavy loads as they scale the world’s highest peaks. Then there’s the Gurkhas, the legendary soldiers from Nepal’s hill tribes known for their stamina, discipline, and bravery. An Indian general once said: ""If a man says he is not afraid of dying, he is either lying or a Gurkha."" That’s good, because it’s going to require a lot of strength to get past the horrors that Nepal has endured in the last four days — and the hardships that are likely still ahead.

There's sadly nothing unusual about the rift between big American companies and the European regulators trying to keep them in check, but the tenor of this complaint is slightly different. Not merely bemoaning excess regulation, Facebook expresses unhappiness at the fragmented and inconsistent sets of requirements it has to abide by in each country. It's presently subject to various investigations in countries like the Netherlands and Germany, which Allan describes as ""overlapping"" and rehashing the ""months of demanding, technical audits"" that Facebook already underwent when it set itself up in Ireland. He believes that operating as a pan-European business should be done subject to one coherent set of pan-European rules instead of having to ""comply with 28 independently shifting national variants."" And you know what? He's absolutely right.  ""Tear down the barriers that keep people apart and you make life more fruitful."" There's some inevitable scaremongering and exaggeration in Allan's FT opinion piece, which claims national regulation ""could stop startups before they even really get started"" and force Facebook to roll out new features more slowly ""or not at all."" Still, the crux of Facebook's argument is indisputable and a chronic problem for Europe's common market: without a harmonized regulatory regime, businesses operating in Europe really do face extra expenses and difficulties than their American counterparts. European authorities aren't waiting for Facebook to tell them they're in need of greater harmonization, though. The first pillar of the EU's Digital Agenda for 2020 is titled the Single Digital Market, and the goal it embodies is precisely what Facebook is seeking: a consistent business environment across member states. That doesn't mean Facebook will be happy with the eventual outcome, as Europe might collectively agree to institute greater demands for user privacy and company transparency, but it would address the fragmentation issue that's the topic of today's complaint.",0.6392445628607708,0.3607554371392292,0.2333662720388888,352,5.5767045454545459,243,6.3744855967078191,0,0,"Policy & Law, US & World, Web"

First reported on Sunday, the attack causes sites using Facebook Login to redirect to a third-party page for many web users in China. ""This behavior is occurring locally and beyond the reach of our servers,"" a Facebook spokesperson told The Verge. ""We are investigating the situation."" Because the code is intercepted within China's national telecom infrastructure, only users located in China (and accessing the web without a VPN) will be affected. The attack can also be avoided by disabling Javascript, since the inserted code runs as a Javascript applet. Readers in China have confirmed to The Verge that the redirection attack was still under way as of this morning. Local media in Beijing has also reported on the problem. Researchers have named the capability ""The Great Cannon"" The Great Firewall began intercepting the Facebook Login applet on Sunday, replacing it with a new single-line redirection code from two third-party sites. The result is that, for non-VPN users in China, any page with a Facebook Login button has been redirecting to two sites: wpkg.org or ptraveler.com, an open-source software project and a personal travel blog respectively. It's unclear why the Chinese government would want to send users to these sites, although ptraveler.com seems to have been brought down by the flood of traffic. It's not the first time China has performed this kind of traffic interception. In March, a similar redirection was used to perform a denial-of-service attack on GitHub, apparently in retaliation for dissident content posted through the service. Since the new code is injected as content passes through China's national web filters, there's little doubt that the Chinese government is responsible for the attacks. The research group Citizen Lab has named the capability ""The Great Cannon,"" a play on the Great Firewall censorship filter. It's difficult to say why Facebook Login is being targeted, since the net effect for most users is simply to redirect the browser to an unrelated homepage. Facebook itself is officially blocked in China, although the block has been relaxed in recent years. Some have speculated that an injection attack like this could be used to spoof a Facebook login, but if such an attack is being carried out, it's likely targeted to only a handful of users and effectively invisible on the network scale. It's likely both sites have seen a huge uptick in traffic, but there's no clear reason why these sites would be targets for the Great Cannon, or why Facebook would be the conduit for that attack. 4/28 3:33pm ET: Updated with Facebook comment, and to clarify that Facebook Login is the name of the affected login service.

Police body cameras have become a common request in the wake of recent police killings, most notably Tamir Rice, Walter Scott, Eric Garner, and Eric Harris.

Clinton mentioned each of these cases in the speech, as part of larger concerns over national tensions.

The Orioles won, but no one was there to cheer. The head of Major League Baseball Robert D. Manfred decided this week that it would be safer for fans that the game proceed without spectators in the stands, and the game made history for being the first ever closed to the public. How did we get here? What does a baseball game say about the status quo in America? On April 12th, 25-year-old Freddie Gray was arrested by Baltimore police, allegedly for possession of a switchblade. He was handcuffed and put in the back of a police van. Within the next 45 minutes, his spine was almost completely severed at the neck, leaving him in a coma. He died a week later. The police department still has not been able to explain what happened. Baltimore's black residents, already beaten down by decades of police brutality, deserve answers. They had not received any by Monday — the day of Gray's funeral — when a violent riot erupted. Maryland Governor Larry Hogan declared a state of emergency, bringing the National Guard and police from neighboring counties and states onto the streets of Baltimore in a scene reminiscent of the events in Ferguson. A day at the ballpark against the backdrop of a battered city is surreal, but it’s also telling. Though people are dying on our streets, our institutions would rather have us cling to a fantasy of Americana that leaves them out.  Whatever good intent the MLB may have, the decision to hold the game at all was about money. Pennant races aside, the Orioles already stand to lose more than $300,000 in revenue on ticket sales alone, and would lose more if the game were canceled. But both the MLB commissioner and governor are only reacting to a flashpoint, not the actual problems afflicting communities in Baltimore. No one with a clear view of the issues can argue that financial losses at a ball game can compare to the loss of life and livelihood happening outside Camden Yards and across the country. ""Inconvenience at a ball game is irrelevant."" ""We need to keep in mind people are suffering and dying around the US,"" Orioles COO John Angelos tweeted. ""And while we are thankful no one was injured at Camden Yards, there is a far bigger picture for poor Americans in Baltimore and everywhere who don’t have jobs and are losing economic civil and legal rights. And this makes inconvenience at a ball game irrelevant in light of the needless suffering government is inflicting upon ordinary Americans."" Still, we had baseball. Men paid millions to hit a ball around a field still played, locked in a fortress, away from a calmed yet tense city still gripped by abiding desperation. There was even color commentary. But who was this game for? Certainly not for the fans — they were locked out. It wasn’t for the Baltimore just outside Camden Yards, which is currently occupied by soldiers. And it wasn’t for Freddie Gray or any one of the black and brown men and women brutalized by police, because they couldn’t watch.   In a speech at the White House on Tuesday, President Obama said that while we cannot excuse the criminal activities on the ground, to witness the unrest in Baltimore is to witness people rail against a system that disenfranchises them and their communities. Dismantling that system means not going back to business as usual. ""Everybody will feign concern until the riots go away."" ""If we think that we're just going to send the police to do the dirty work of containing the problems that arise there without, as a nation and as a society, saying, 'What can we do to change those communities, to help lift up those communities and give those kids opportunity,' then we're not going to solve this problem,"" Obama said. ""And we'll go through the same cycles of periodic conflicts between the police and communities, and the occasional riots in the streets, and everybody will feign concern until it goes away and we just go about our business as usual."" Business as usual is a baseball game on any other day.

Wallace was frustrated with the immense literary fame the book brought him. Lipsky was hunting for a Rolling Stone story, and an angle on this reclusive, difficult-to-crack author. And while the film parallels Infinite Jest thematically, and comes with its own high-flying vocabulary, it winds up just being about two men dueling for control and struggling with the attempt to express themselves, and to get what they each want out of an unnatural and only fitfully satisfying situation. It’s a powerful but surprisingly enjoyable and accessible film, a surprise Sundance hit.   Segel's performance is the biggest revelation in a revelatory movie Comic actor Jason Segel, best known for playing (and often scripting) hyperactive, sweet but stymied dorks in the likes of How I Met Your Mother, The Muppets, Freaks And Geeks, and Forgetting Sarah Marshall, wasn't an obvious choice to take on the complicated role of Wallace in the film. Early responses to set photos of him in Wallace regalia — the shaggy long hair, the scraggly stubble, the casual biker forehead-bandana — were harsh and dismissive. But he winds up being the biggest revelation in a revelatory movie. He's still distinctly Segel, in spite of taking on Wallace's rapidly shifting cadences and buck-a-word vocabulary, but he disappears into this role in a way he never has before, and he brings a strange inner intensity to a man mostly characterized by his laid-back surface and mild dubiousness about the entire interview process. Jesse Eisenberg, as Lipsky, pushes Wallace consistently throughout the film, but the burden of proof is on Segel, as he navigates Wallace's shifting feelings about Infinite Jest, about how he's living out the book's themes, and about whether he even wants the conversation to continue. I recently spoke to Segel about his anxiety over the role, and how life and art complicated each other significantly around the film. Tasha Robinson: You've said the test of this movie is going to be how well it connects with people. But given that it's about such a specific situation, between two very distinctive, idiosyncratic people, what do you see as the larger issues where people can see themselves in this story? Jason Segel: I think for me, it's the themes of two [books]: Infinite Jest and This Is Water. I think they tie together, and I think you can feel that in This Is Water, which was written 10 years later, David Foster Wallace had worked through these themes a little better. It's all about this scary moment where you realize that [you've done] what you've been told is going to make you feel satisfied. Everything goes the way it's supposed to. But you're left feeling empty. The itch is still there. That's the SOS that's being sent out in Infinite Jest, as I read it. I felt like I was listening to a guy say, ""Hey, I feel dissatisfied, does anyone else want to join me in this conversation?"" And then you read This Is Water, and I feel like it's a guy who's worked through that idea a little further, and is saying, ""Look, I'm no expert, and I'm still trying to figure this out myself, but it seems to me like maybe the solution is where we place our value. And as opposed to putting it in success, or money, or beauty, we should put it in connection. Connection with each other, connection with some sort of higher power."" But what I hope resonates with the movie is this conversation, which is, ""Maybe we need to refocus our energy if we want to feel satisfied."" You did a book club with Infinite Jest with some friends, studying it and discussing it together. What did you get out of that process, in terms of understanding these themes? What really was interesting to me was — the book is three prongs. There's a recovery house in Boston, so that one is endeavor. There's a tennis academy, and that's achievement. And then the third is about an entertainment that's so pleasurable, it zombifies the viewer. So you've got pleasure, achievement, and entertainment, and in all three of those pursuits, people are left feeling dissatisfied. Numb. Confused. And in reading it with three other guys around my age, it was interesting that different people strongly identify with one of those elements, because it's reflective of where they've placed their bets. And to have four grown men sit around on a Sunday and end up talking pretty candidly about feelings of dissatisfaction, I think really spoke to the kind of author David Foster Wallace is. I can't think of another experience I've had like that, except maybe Catcher In The Rye in high school. How do you use all these big ideas to find the character of the author — or at least, how he should play onscreen? I think especially in this circumstance, one of the big poles of the dynamic between Wallace and Lipsky is, Wallace is going through this moment in real time. The movie takes place over the last four days of the Infinite Jest book tour, so it is happening. Things have gone as well as they can possibly go, and Wallace still feels the same. He has very complicated feelings, but he doesn't feel the way he hoped and dreamed he would. And you get the sense that he would really like to talk about that with Lipsky. He keeps trying to open that conversation, and Lipsky is just so concerned with his own agenda that he can't see it. In effect, he calls Wallace a liar several times: ""Stop putting up this aw-shucks façade."" And Wallace is saying, ""If you would just listen to me, I have the real story for you right now, kid."" This is being heralded as a radically different role for you, a big career move in terms of depth and drama. Did it feel that different to you? Did you have to approach it differently from other roles? Yeah, if I'm to be perfectly honest about it — it sounds like a joke, but it's really true. I think having written a lot of what I've done before, I had never had to do prep the way I did prep for this. I'd never played a real person. I'd never had to sit and try to think about exactly what I meant by each thing I was saying, because normally, I had written it. And so honestly, what I tried to do was picture what an actor I admired would do, and I copied that. And that is the absolute truth. I imagined what somebody would do if they were given this part, and then I did all of those things. Who did you have in mind? Was this a ""What would Meryl Streep do?"" kind of process? It was all in that wheelhouse. But I think anyone I bring up would sound comparative, and that's the last thing I want to do. It's tough in print to get tone across. But all of the actors I admired growing up — there are some actors out there where you can't sense any self-satisfaction behind their acting, and that's what I really respond to. You've said the script was so good, it made you feel safe with the film but anxious about whether you were up to the material. Did that anxiety fade in prep? During filming? Was there a point where you came to a comfort with the material? I became comfortable on the second day of shooting. There was no way to feel comfortable in prep, because there was no rehearsal process. There just wasn't the opportunity for the real moment where I walked out in full costume, doing the full dialect, the speech pattern. And I hadn't acted against Jesse yet. So day one, I was scared. And luckily, that worked, because it was the scene where Jesse and I meet for the first time, and I think David Foster Wallace is anxious in that moment. I think that translates. Day two, we shot the final scenes in the house, between us. We shot the big [confrontation] scenes at the end. And so that was a real trial-by-fire day. By the time that was done, there was some feeling of, ""Well, you've shot the big scenes now. So if you messed those up, there's nothing you can do!"" So it got a little easier at that point, because I was just in the moment. Honestly, this whole movie is me trying to listen to Jesse. Like Lipsky and Wallace, the two of you didn't know each other at the beginning of production, and you shot largely in sequence. How did that play on your end? Did you avoid spending time together off set, to keep from getting out of sync with the material? No, quite the opposite, actually. It was a really unique experience. It was negative-15 degrees in Grand Rapids, Michigan. I don't know if you have experience with that kind of weather, but there's forced intimacy about it. Like, the windows are always rolled up in the car. You're really forced to talk to each other in a tight-space kind of way. So we drove to work together every morning, and would act together all day, and then drove home together at night, and we would talk about what we had shot, or basketball, or what was going on in our lives. The whole process, there was a life-imitating-art thing going on. I'm just a few years older than Jesse. We were both in big transition periods in our life and career. So we had a lot to talk about, and a lot of it circled these themes. How did you keep the dialogue loose and natural? You said James Ponsoldt didn't have a rehearsal process. Was that to keep the dialogue from getting too rote with repetition? It wasn't that he wasn't interested in rehearsal, it's just that scheduling made it impossible. I was doing [How I Met Your Mother] in Los Angeles up until the day before I started shooting. I wrapped the TV show on a Friday, and flew out and started my first day of shooting on Monday. So there just wasn't any time for rehearsal. But James said, ""If this was a movie about two roommates, or best friends, or brothers, it would be necessary."" But for this, it worked, because you can feel us sniffing each other out on camera. I think it works well. There's a Frost/Nixon element to this movie that's driving a lot of the tension. Marshall on How I Met Your Mother is a very different character from Wallace, but several of your best-known characters have this shared sense of a surface affability hiding a deep core of resentment or anger, and often the stories are about them figuring out how and when to access it. Do you feel any sense of connection there? I know what you're talking about, but I think in a lot of the characters I play, instead of anger bubbling beneath, it's sadness and insecurity. They never really get angry. Some of them have been about people dealing with deep-seated insecurity, which is an area that's always really interested me. But again, having written a lot of what I've done ... In my 30s, I'm just thinking about different stuff. I'm at a different place in my life. Where I was when we shot this was very similar to one of the lines Wallace says in the movie: ""I have to face the reality that right now, I'm 34 years old, alone in a room with a piece of paper."" And that's very much how I felt when we were shooting. The TV show had just ended after almost a decade. I was feeling like I wanted to do something other than what I was previously successful doing. So there was a big part of me that just felt like, ""What now?"" That I'm basically having to start from scratch. And I think that's how Wallace was feeling in that moment. He writes a thousand-page book, and... I know what a press tour is like, I've done a bunch of them. I guarantee you that on the Infinite Jest press tour, they're asking him, ""What's next?"" Would you say this kind of film is what you want out of the next phase of your career? Yeah, I think what I want out of the next phase of my career is to continue to do things that scare me. I don't feel limited by any genre, or anything like that. I just want to be constantly exploring my limits. What was the last role before this that scared you? Jeff Who Lives At Home, which was a few years ago. The Muppets scared me for other reasons, just because I love the Muppets so much, I really didn't want to mess it up. But Jeff Who Lives At Home was something where I was equally scared going in. ""I want to continue to do things that scare me."" Speaking of anxieties, the speculation about this film during its production was fairly negative, much of it to do with your casting as Wallace. There seemed to be a feeling that the image of you dressed in Wallace's idiosyncratic style was automatically comical. Were you concerned about that perception? No, I stopped looking at the internet a long time ago. Honestly, when I found out I was going to be playing this part, I had better uses of my time than to manage other people's fear about the movie. I had my own fear to deal with. I think the whole beginning process of digging into this was me figuring out how to proceed unapologetically. If you could sniff out that I wasn't sure, why should anyone else be sure? If I didn't believe it, why should anyone else believe it? So I spent a little time — I didn't overindulge in it, but I spent some time coming to believe I was the best person to do this. Or at the very least, that I was the one hired.

Here’s the shortest possible recap, just in case you haven’t been following every twist and turn: Meek Mill accused Drake of using a ghostwriter for “R.I.C.O.,” a track they recorded together for Meek’s new album Dreams Worth More Than Money. Drake stayed silent until Saturday night, when he released three new tracks during his OVO Sound radio show on Beats 1. One of them was “Charged Up,” a diss track aimed at Meek. Meek called the song “baby lotion soft.” He was supposed to premiere a rebuttal on New York's Hot 97 Monday night, but the evening came and went without a new track. Drake took the opportunity to go on the offensive and released another new track, “Back to Back,” on SoundCloud early Wednesday morning. That’s where we are now.  This may end up being nothing more than a fun summer diversion, but it feels like it’s gobbling up every spare molecule in the world of music right now. And since so many of us at The Verge are passionate and invested in the outcome of Drizzygate, we’ve decided to hash this beef out at the roundtable. Jamieson Cox: Say you’re a famous basketball player. You’re not just famous, you’re fantastic — it wouldn’t be a stretch to call you one of the best players of your generation. You can shoot, pass, and handle the ball; your defense isn’t bad. You get voted into the All-Star Game every year, and you’re beloved by fans. It’s hard to dispute your all-around basketball excellence. Children dunk on their siblings in his honor Let’s say you have an acquaintance. Your acquaintance's stats are much worse. He’s a rotation player, but a few steps below stardom, and you helped him gain his footing in the league when you played on the same team for a while. Your acquaintance has one specific skill that stands out: he might be the best dunker in the league. There isn’t anyone who can match his ferocity or ruthlessness — there's even a popular series of Vines in which adorable children dunk on their helpless siblings, and it was created in his honor.    You wake up one morning and learn something troubling: your acquaintance has taken to Twitter to talk smack about you. He’s talking about your creativity on the court. He’s telling people you haven’t come up with a single original move, and that you have someone working with you in the gym who invents your every flashy dribble, layup, and dunk. In short, he’s saying you’re a fraud. And to cap everything off, he challenges you to a dunk contest. If you want to prove to everyone that your former friend’s allegations are false, this is the place you’d do it. The benefits of participating in the contest are obvious. If you win, no one’s going to question your creativity again, and rising to the occasion will be considered a display of cojones on your part. But if you lose — and there’s a decent chance you lose, because you’re going against one of the best dunkers in the world — it’s going to linger for a long time. You could be inducted into the Hall of Fame one day, but a permanent record of your embarrassment will remain on YouTube: that one time you were challenged and ended up with your ass kicked. But there’s an alternative path. You can size up your acquaintance and his generally mediocre portfolio of skills, and you can tell him that you don’t need to dignify his challenge with a response. Let’s say that someone did help you come with your moves: who cares? You’re still the one who executed them, right? And they’re just one tiny part of your game, right? You’re one of the best players in the game with or without any kind of dunking panache, and agreeing to enter the contest is just validating your acquaintance. You have very little to gain and a lot more to lose, and dunking isn’t an integral part of your play style in the first place. So what are you going to do? Are you going to enter the contest, or are you going to brush the challenge away like a beetle on your sleeve? (Drake should’ve ignored this whole thing.) Kwame Opam: This shit is chess, it ain’t checkers. Meek started with the profound mistake of getting into his feelings and challenging Drake’s authenticity on Twitter. People went nuts. Drake responded to the whole thing like a PR professional, which is ultimately something he’s far better at. He waited for interest to reach a steady boil, and released ""Charged Up"" as if on a whim. The crowd cheered! He waited a little more, watched us all tweet up a storm when Meek failed to make a response on Hot 97, and released ""Back to Back."" The crowd is beside themselves right now. If there was any doubt that Aubrey knows how to work an audience even in the heat of a beef, it should be squashed. Those were just jabs, though. Drake is dancing. Meek by now has no choice but to come out with fire and brimstone to undo some of the damage he’s taken. So he’ll almost certainly come out with haymakers, aiming squarely at Drake’s softness: the mall performances, the Madonna fiasco, and the fact that Nicki was never on his arm. And those blows will land, since Meek is a ferocious technical lyricist. Drake Brought Meek's Career to New Heights But Drake isn’t stupid. The man’s ubiquitous for a reason. He gets compared to Kendrick for a reason. (I’m not saying those comparisons are valid. I’m just saying those are the kinds of conversations we have in 2015.) He probably knows Meek will tire himself out throwing punches. He also knows punches like that can’t truly harm him since he already owns up to being a singin’ ass rapper. In a market where Kanye long ago changed the landscape and someone like Future can sell records, Philly hardness isn’t enough to win beefs. It also takes savvy and knowing your enemy. So Drake will keep dancing. He’ll have to punch harder, yes, but he’s also better positioned to outlast Meek. And the killer move? All Drake has to say is Meek matters more now because of this beef. Drake brought your career to new heights, man. ""Realness"" didn’t. Good job! If you don't get better, you become irrelevant But if Meek comes out blazing (and he really has no choice but to), it’s good for everyone. Drake will continue to be one of the biggest hip-hop acts in the world, but Meek Mill will also be a known commodity. We'll forget this beef, but your friends might know his name when they might not have previously. That’s why people say beef is good for hip-hop. It forces everyone to be better or fall into irrelevance. Lizzie Plaugic: I think when the supercontinent Pangea started breaking up, it probably seemed apocalyptic. Land masses were colliding! Coastlines were cracking! An entire planet was trying to subtly readjust its junk. But in the end, we got the Earth as we know it (or something). On July 22nd, Philly rapper Meek Mill gave the Earth another gift. In the days that followed, the air felt lighter, a little more electric than usual. People started taking sides. We hunted down alleged ghostwriter Quentin Miller’s SoundCloud and mined it for anything that resembled a Drizzy flow. Drake released not one, but two comeback tracks. Elaborate conspiracies surfaced. Rick Ross messed up his mathematical symbols. We remembered past hip-hop beefs with nostalgia and reverence. Perhaps most importantly, we remembered Ja Rule. Meek activated a dormant hip-hop beef volcano Would it have been more mature of Drake to ignore the whole thing? Yeah. He’s the biggest name in rap right now, and a lot of people aren’t even sure who Meek Mill is. But I’m glad Drake didn’t ignore it. And I'm glad that Meek sent the tweet out into the world in the first place, because it became the rumble that activated a long-silent volcano of hip-hop beefs. Now, the world feels new. This, my friends, is our Pangea. So I’m Team Meek. Because Meek’s original diss was the 140-character plate-shift for two pretty good Drake tracks, some decent jokes, and a GoFundMe to help Meek pay for a diss track (which has since been deleted). For the last seven days, we’ve had an entire little world of Drake and Meek, and it’s been beautiful. This is an internet fight that you can watch from the outside; a spectator sport for those of us who don’t like balls. Eventually, most of the world will forget about this fight, in the way that most of the world doesn’t think about plate tectonics on the daily. And if this Pangea analogy holds up, it leads to only one possible conclusion: Meek Mill is God, but Drake is Santa Claus. Micah Singleton: Let’s be honest: Drake is the easiest target in hip-hop. He sings, he’s emotional, he’s been chasing Rihanna and Nicki for years to no avail — people have been itching to go at him since he left Canada. Drake's main defense is that he knows his flaws and makes fun of them before anyone else can. He posts the memes and pokes fun at his DeGrassi past on SNL. So when Meek Mill came out with this ghostwriting claim, it became open season on Drake. And the only way to end hunting season is to take out the biggest hunter so viciously that everyone will know this Canadian forest is off-limits. Drake couldn’t sit this one out. He couldn’t hide out in the YOLO Estate with 40 and Oliver. He had to respond. What I didn’t see coming was this type of response. Drake has eschewed the classic knockout diss track in favor of a Mayweather-esque ""I’m going to jab you in the face until I win by decision"" fighting style. ""Charged Up"" was the most relaxed diss record in history, if it was even a diss record. It was like a diss preamble. It was a direct shot at Meek's rapping style, which is best described as yelling with purpose, while Drake sounded like he recorded the song in a library. It also carried a warning of what was to come: ""I stay silent ‘cause we at war and I’m very patient / 6 God is watching, I just hope you’re prepared to face him."" Drake didn't even wait for meek to respond The real flames from Drake came in ""Back to Back,"" which is just mean. Very, very mean. He didn’t even wait for Meek to respond with his own diss track. Drake just hit him again. Mean. Drake is up 2-0. Meek still hasn’t responded. And given his lackluster history of diss records (a history betraying his technical skill), it doesn’t look good for the Philly kid. At this point, there’s nothing left to say. Sorry, Nicki. Kaitlyn Tiffany: The game of The Hills was built around Lauren Conrad. Her first mixtape, Laguna Beach, dropped before the turn of the decade, and her charismatic aloofness carried her through and out of the TV circuit and into a successful career as an author, designer, and lifestyle brand mogul. She taught us to love ourselves but only if we had style, she passed down everything she knew about the Fame Game, and we embraced her as the wise but flawed (turning down a Parisian internship for a boy with frosted tips?) LC, Queen of the Hills. She was a new kind of celebrity, and some people thought she was boring, but that was fucking nonsense. For a while, she loved a man named Brody Jenner, and said that they were the same person, which was obviously only about 40 percent true. After LC was long gone from The Hills and its childish games, a bold newcomer made the ill-advised choice to step to her. The thinner, blonder, fiercer girl on the block was Kristen Cavallari, and there was something weirdly charming about the brazenness with which she sharpened her fangs. She swooped right in to stir shit up and to write a book with a slightly better title than any of LC’s books. She was about that money, and about Brody Jenner. She flirted, and oh, how Brody flirted back. LC said she was over it, but it’s hard to believe that people get over Brody Jenner.   Eventually the implied hostility between any two talented public personalities who do similar things as a career came to a head —  Kristen Cavallari implied that LC was a ""slutbag."" It was a roughly hewn diss, to say the least, but as Kristen so helpfully pointed out to LC (with the internet as an intermediary): ""No one remembers the nice girl."" So LC listened and spun a near-perfect diss track that went something like, ""If someone asked me to list three good things about you, I would say you are really good at losing baby weight."" At this point, nobody looked good. In this metaphor, Brody is the only winner. He has not one, but two happy endings — seeing Kristen’s limo off to the airport, and then coming home to LC, who has been holding a victorious still-the-Queen grin in her pocket all this time. He’s the one who didn’t get down and dirty, the one who faked it all — the one who got away. As Brody and Nicki Minaj know, sometimes it's good to be stuck in the middle.",0.41084171670122605,0.589158283298774,0.4896597491055976,2305,4.6255965292841648,1040,6.023076923076923,0,3,"Culture, Entertainment, Music"

""Greg and I have always respected each other and believed in the engagement and reach of mobile,"" Kim said in a statement. They join a quickly-growing team that includes recently hired former Xbox strategist Eric Doty; back in May, Mobcrush announced $4.9 million in funding to help the new company expand. Potential for big business Mobile game streaming isn't an entirely new frontier. Companies like Kamcord already exist, while Twitch has dabbled in mobile as well. None have really caught on in a big way, however, and it looks like Mobcrush is attempting to differentiate itself through ease of use. The company describes itself as ""the first one-click, multi-platform streaming solution that allows players to live stream gameplay sessions at the touch of a button"" on mobile; the service doesn't require a PC or any other extra hardware to work. And it appears that there may be a market for the service — during the closed beta period, a stream of Boom Beach saw more than 114,000 views, including a high of 20,000 concurrently. While mobile game streaming has yet to explode in popularity, it's clear why companies are testing the waters.

On September 11th, 2012, Islamic militants attacked two American compounds in Benghazi, Libya, killing two CIA contractors, a US foreign service information management officer, and a US ambassador — Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens became the first US ambassador to be killed in the line of duty since the late 1970s. Following the attack, State Department officials received continued criticism for failing to provide additional security support before the attack, with then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton still embroiled in controversy among some right-wing critics over unreleased internal emails. I'll let Vox explain the rest:      I'd like to highlight two things, even though I know they're plenty obvious. Stick with me. First thing: the director of the Transformers films, Armageddon, and Bad Boys and Bad Boys 2 is making a film about a real-life attack that resulted in the deaths of Americans. Let this sink in: the last time Bay made a movie inspired by real life, it was Pain & Gain; the time before that, Pearl Harbor. Bay is many things, but subtle is not one of them. Second thing: Jim Halpert, welcome back! I've really enjoyed your voice work in The Wind Rises, Monsters University, BoJack Horseman, and all those Esurance commercials. According to IMDb, you were in Aloha. How was Hawaii? I have to say 13 Hours feels like a strange choice, but maybe this will do for you what Zero Dark Thirty did for Chris Pratt. If this is what it takes to get Krasiniski a superhero movie, I'm okay with that. And what does Jim Halpert think of bulky John Krasinski?

Over the last few weeks, we've seen an increasing pace of leaked photos of Sony's next smartphone, the Xperia Z5. Actually, we're expecting three different models: the Z5, the Z5 Compact, and the Z5 Premium (or maybe Z5 Plus, depending on who's doing the leaking). All three will stick to Sony's tried and true design language, which is a spartan and squarish combination of metal rails and glass. It's not a flashy design anymore, but it does have a sort of reserved charm. You can get your best look at the new phones at the Xperia Blog (naturally), which uncovered some promotional images that Sony let slip. In the US, Sony's phones have had more of a cult following than a huge customer base — mostly because Sony hasn't been effective at getting the things into market here. We don't know whether that will change with the Z5, but we are beginning to get a sense of what the new features in the Z5 will be thanks to the leaks. The latest is that the camera will apparently include a 23-megapixel sensor. We've also seen evidence that the power button, seated on the righthand side, will integrate a fingerprint scanner.  Sony Z(TBC) and Compact #Z5 pic.twitter.com/j04UcGQNmk We can also break down the differences between the three models, thanks in part to a Facebook page that got a little overzealous (Sony has disavowed the page as unofficial). The Z5 Compact should have a 4.6-inch, 720p screen and the regular old Z5 should have a 5.2-inch 1080p screen. The Z5 Premium is expected to have a 5.5-inch screen, but the spec that will wow the cultists is the Ultra-HD 4K display. Sony might just want to suggest that this is the phone you'll want to drop into Google Cardboard for VR as well.

Already we've heard reports about a new remote with a touchpad and microphone, but now TechCrunch is reporting that it will do even more: the remote will supposedly be motion sensitive. The remote is said to likely include sensors that track it as it moves in multiple directions, allowing it to detect motion about as well as the Wii Remote. The Wii Remote also relies on an IR sensor, but it isn't stated whether this remote will require a similar accessory or work on its own.  This could be Apple's next step into gaming The implication, of course, is that the Apple TV could become a major new competitor in casual gaming. That's a likely trajectory for it even without a Wii-like remote: Apple is supposed to finally open up an app store for the Apple TV, and games are sure to follow quickly. The store would give Apple TV owners an easy way to start gaming on their TV and likely at a much lower cost than buying an Xbox or PlayStation. That'll require the Apple TV to get a lot more powerful, and it's supposed to. Reports have pegged it as including a version of the iPhone 6's A8 processor, which TechCrunch suggests could be running stronger than usual here since the Apple TV won't have to limit itself to conserve battery the way a phone would. Apple is also supposed to be making these changes to the remote simply to make the Apple TV easier to use. TechCrunch reports that the device's interface has been improved as well — right now it's literally just an endless grid of rectangles — apparently in a way that makes it easier to navigate through large libraries, which, as a streaming box, the Apple TV is kind of inherently composed of. One thing that the Apple TV is still not expected to include is access to an Apple-made streaming TV service. That's supposed to be because of a struggle to make content deals, and TechCrunch suggests that Apple is going ahead with the launch now to gain leverage. Should this new Apple TV — and, perhaps more importantly, the many video sources in its app store — begin to succeed in a big way, content partners may be a lot more eager to get on board.

The deal — which includes unlimited talk, text, and 2GB of data — is a direct shot across the bows of rival AT&T, which recently acquired the satellite TV provider for $49 billion. AT&T has been offering DirecTV customers up to $500 a line if they switch to its service, but Sprint is hoping to outbid them with its new deal (valid until September 30th). There are, of course, caveats. DirecTV customers tempted to switch will have to pay a $36 activation fee and buy or lease a new phone, and once their free year is up they'll automatically be moved to a $50 a month plan until they pay off their Sprint device. (DirecTV customers who are already with Sprint can also get in on the deal by adding a new line to their wireless plan.) Anyone who wants to take advantage of the offer will have to upload a copy of a recent DirecTV bill to Sprint's website or drop by a Sprint store with some form of proof. ""DirecTV customers [...] shouldn’t have to settle for AT&T wireless."" ""DirecTV customers love their TV service, but they shouldn’t have to settle for AT&T wireless,"" said Sprint's chief marketing officer Kevin Crull in a press statement. A spokesperson for AT&T, Brad Burns, replied: ""This ranks right up there with a desperate Hail Mary pass to a petite defensive lineman. With Sprint’s network and the many asterisks on this deal, we’re feeling good about our offers."" Giving away a year's worth of free service is certainly an extreme move, even in 2015's somewhat frenzied wireless market. Still, for consumers there's only one important question: do you save more money with AT&T or Sprint? The answer, unfortunately, depends on exactly what you're looking for in a wireless plan, although CNN Money pegs the upfront value of the deals as $900 from Sprint or $620 from AT&T.

Canada is still dealing with the Disneyland outbreak Although the outbreak is over in the US, the Canadian province of Quebec is still dealing with Disneyland-related cases. And the US isn't measles-free; the country is home to a number of other measles outbreaks, the Associated Press reports. The source of the Disneyland outbreak was an overseas visitor, according to the CDC. Measles is highly contagious and sometimes deadly. As a result, the outbreak caused a heated debate about vaccinations in the US; had kids been vaccinated against the disease, the outbreak would not have been so large, many reasoned. To ensure that this doesn't happen again, California legislators have introduced a bill called SB 277, which would make it necessary for kids to be vaccinated against measles and other diseases before enrolling in a school in the state, reports the LA Times. Exemptions based on medical reasons would still be possible under this new law. Right now, more than 13,000 children of kindergarden age are exempt from vaccinations because of their parents' beliefs.",0.5098603789025559,0.49013962109744413,0.8563947747031814,308,5.1006493506493502,186,5.693548387096774,0,0,"Science, US & World"

The number of students who had used an e-cigarette within a month of being surveyed tripled in 2014; 2.5 million total were using them. Use of e-cigarettes is more common among high school students, about 13.4 percent of whom had used an e-cigarette within 30 days of taking the survey.  ""What we've seen in marketing is Mad Men comes to e-cigarettes."" The results come from the 2014 National Youth Tobacco Survey and are being published today by the CDC. The CDC puts a lot of blame on advertising for the increase in usage, saying that e-cigarette manufacturers are using a mixture of ""sex, free samples, [and] flavors"" — the same things that were originally found to be problematic with cigarette ads. ""What we've seen in marketing is Mad Men comes to e-cigarettes,"" says Tom Skinner, a CDC spokesperson. Currently, there's little regulation of e-cigarettes. Though the FDA has indicated interest, it hasn't yet taken real action. Its initial proposals would ban sales to people under 18 and prohibit free samples. It wouldn't, however, address marketing or usage of flavors. Health warnings would also have to be included. The agency is expected to finalize its rules in June. Vaping among students is ""particularly worrisome"" since the brain is still developing in adolescents; smoking in that group has been linked to issues with memory and attention. Clearly, the CDC would like to see some more regulation here. Flavoring and advertising are obvious places to start, when considering marketing that appeals to children. After all, that's where cigarette marketing regulations started as well.

Despite belonging to entirely different species, we treat them like family, and they really do seem to love us. When they stare at us — and we’re not holding food — it feels real. It feels right. Now, we’re one step closer to figuring out why that is. As it turns out, when humans gaze into their dogs’ eyes, they experience a rise in oxytocin —  a hormone linked to human bonding and some other, less cuddly behavior. Moreover, when dogs stare back at their humans, they experience a similar rise in oxytocin. Taken together, the findings hint that the reaction may have evolved simultaneously in both humans and dogs, as these animals were domesticated. It may also explain why humans and their dogs bond so tightly. Affection ""similar to that felt toward human family members."" ""These results suggest that humans may feel affection for their companion dogs similar to that felt toward human family members,"" the researchers write in the study, published today in Science. That's because when dogs make eye contact with their owners, they trigger biological signals similar to the ones that are activated when a mother looks at her child. To figure out what role oxytocin plays in dog-human relationships, researchers conducted two experiments. In the first experiment, researchers compared oxytocin levels in urine belonging to 30 dogs and their owners before and after a 30-minute interaction. They also measured how long dogs and owners stared at each other, and how often they touched. Then, they did the same things with pairs of wolves and their owners; the wolves has been raised by humans their entire lives. The idea here was to see if undomesticated animals that are closely related to dogs would lead to the same result.  Credit: AAAS/Carla Schaffer  The researchers found that the dogs and their owners had increased levels of oxytocin in their urine after gazing into each other’s eyes. This didn’t occur in the wolves, or the humans who own them, however. Moreover, the owners whose dogs looked at them the most experienced the largest increase in oxytocin — an increase that their dogs mirrored. Female dogs were more affected by the drug To see if there was a causal relationship between the increase in oxytocin seen in the dogs and the increase seen in humans, the researchers conducted a second experiment. This time, they administered oxytocin — or a saline solution devoid of oxytocin — to the noses of a new group of 27 dogs. This didn't affect the male dogs. But in female dogs, researchers saw an increase in the amount of time they spent staring at their owners. Also, the dog owners experienced a larger-than-normal increase in their own oxytocin levels when they interacted with their doped-up female dogs. The researchers aren’t sure why female dogs were more affected by the oxytocin than the male dogs. This difference wasn’t observed in the first experiment, so it’s possible that female dogs are simply more sensitive to the artificial administration of the drug. There may also be some dog behaviors at work here that we don’t quite understand yet; scientists will have to conduct more experiments like these to figure that out. One thing to note, however, is that oxytocin hasn’t just been linked to caring, love, and trust. Some studies have linked it to increased envy in humans, and decreased cooperation. So, you probably shouldn’t refer to it as the ""love hormone"" — as many have in the past. That said, it does appear to play a role in human social interactions in general, regardless of whether the interactions are positive. And if this study stands the test of time, we’ll probably be able to add dog-human bonding to the ""love"" side of the oxytocin list — which is a pretty ingenious evolutionary phenomenon, when you think about it. When dogs look at us — and we're not holding food — it feels real After all, the rise in oxytocin seen in humans when they look at their dog is pretty similar to the rise in oxytocin seen in mothers when they look at their kids. And humans who report feeling very satisfied with their dog-human relationship tend to maintain a mutual gaze with their pet for longer periods. This means that dogs, through domestication, may have figured out a way to insert themselves in a hormonal pathway that was once exclusive to humans. It’s a neat biological and evolutionary trick — one that likely secured the dog’s spot as humanity’s ""best friend.""",0.7379176288284705,0.26208237117152955,0.18064747504404258,775,4.910967741935484,375,5.9039999999999999,1,0,

When a camera sensor is exposed to light, the pixels use photodiodes to generate an electric current. That helps the sensor measure the intensity of the light, and those measurements are used to produce images. Solar cells, on the other hand, take the light and convert it into electric power. The processes are similar enough that a team at Columbia University's School of Engineering and Applied Science created an image sensor with diodes that can alternate between performing both of these tasks. According to them, it's the first of its kind.The camera's sensor toggles between making images and harvesting power ""A few different designs for image sensors that can harvest energy have been proposed in the past,"" Shree K. Nayar, the professor who led the team, said in a release about the project. ""However, our prototype is the first demonstration of a fully self-powered video camera."" When exposed to light, the camera's sensor toggles between capturing an image and charging the power supply. It works well enough to capture one image per second, but it has a tiny resolution of just 30 pixels by 40 pixels (that's .0012 megapixels, for those of you keeping count). Nayar and his team built the camera with off-the-shelf components, and used a 3D printer to create the body.   While a prototype camera with such meager capabilities might not sound very practical, what the team at Columbia has accomplished could have vast implications. In the short term, the technology could be used in things like always-on security cameras, wearables, and other connected devices. But battery technology is a huge hurdle even for industry-leading camera makers, so it's easy to imagine their interest in research like this. GoPro's CEO Nick Woodman discussed his company's struggles during the company's quarterly earnings call earlier this year.

The chemicals making your e-cigarette taste like cotton candy may be harmful to your health, even when they're advertised as being safe. In a new study on the flavorings that go into e-cig liquids, researchers found that certain flavoring chemicals were present in quantities beyond what may be safe for inhalation. The study comes from Portland State University and is being published today in BMJ's Tobacco Control.  Food-grade flavoring isn't necessarily safe for inhalation The researchers looked at 30 e-cig liquids — the fluid that's heated into vapor — taken from a number of companies, including the major manufacturers Njoy and Blu. All of the liquids were flavored, with tested varieties including tobacco, menthol, cotton candy, bubble gum, chocolate, and fruit flavors. A number of chemicals were present in multiple flavorings, including two that the researchers say were present in high enough volumes to potentially cause harm. ""A lot of e-cigarette manufacturers are representing that the components are food grade and implying that these are safe for use in e-cigarettes,"" Jim Pankow, a Portland State University chemistry professor and corresponding author of the study, tells The Verge. ""But all of the safety studies"" that they point to, he says, ""have been for ingestion, not for inhalation."" Neither Njoy or Blu assert that their liquids are ""generally recognized as safe,"" but you'll quickly stumble across sellers who do if you're searching online for flavored liquids. The trouble is, there isn't a lot of data on what is safe for inhalation. Pankow and his team honed in on two specific chemicals, vanillin and benzaldehyde, that recurred in the liquids and do have prior standards on inhalation safety for people working with them in potentially large quantities. In both cases, the researchers calculated that e-cigs may deliver double the exposure limit over the course of a day. That could be a problem, as both chemicals are known irritants of the respiratory tract, which enables breathing. ""What is in the vapor can be different than what is in the liquid."" But ultimately, we still don't know exactly where the limit is before these chemicals cause harm. We don't know if someone would typically cross those limits while vaping, either: in these two cases, the calculated exposure is based on daily vaping projections, not measurements. The study also uses chemical measurements taken from the liquids — not from the vapor that they produce, which could make a difference. ""Several studies show that what is in the vapor can be different than what is in the liquid, ... and the vapor is what we primarily care about,"" Thomas Sussan, an e-cigarette researcher at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health who was not involved with the study, writes in an email to The Verge. Pankow says that this is a fair question, but that there's no reason to believe the quantities will differ dramatically. ""It's gonna be pretty similar. There's no reason to think that there would be a lot of destruction of the vanillin,"" he says. ""So to a first approximation, just looking at the liquid is going to be a good estimate of what the exposure is."" Because these chemicals haven't been analyzed directly against human subjects or cells, Sussan cautions that ""any implication regarding health is speculative and is based on projections of doses that may be achieved in a person."" For now, he agrees, ""the concentrations that are required to cause harm are largely unknown."" Still, there's at least one very obvious takeaway. ""Maybe there should be labelling requirements for e-cigarette fluids,"" Pankow says, ""that doesn't seem like a stretch.""

""Removing a human from the machine can open up room to experiment with more risk, improve systems faster, and get them to the fleet quicker."" To push the drone agenda, Mabus said he planned to create a new office for uncrewed technology in the Navy and appoint a deputy assistant director to champion the technology. ""Removing a human from the machine can open up room to experiment."" In addition to drones, the Navy is adopting other recent technological advances for its activities. The force has experimented with using 3D printers to construct vital parts and medical equipment as part of a ""print the fleet"" program, but Mabus said the use of the technology is to be expanded, and could soon be used to print swarms of vehicles such as the Close-In Autonomous Disposable Aircraft (CICADA). Other advances could help the Navy prototype these new vehicles, using simulations and modeling programs to try new concepts without, as Mabus called it, ""bending steel.""

They have no idea what they’re getting into if they get into that.""  ""We take steel, raw steel, and turn it into car."" Instead, Akerson says that Apple should focus on helping incumbent automakers with in-car electronics. (That's already happening with CarPlay, of course, but it's a drop in the bucket compared to the number of control systems inside a modern car, most of which are still designed by automakers and their suppliers.) Akerson also noted that margins on cars are typically razor-thin, while the iPhone practically prints money. I don't know whether Apple will end up building a car; no one outside Cupertino really does. And I believe Akerson wholeheartedly when he says that making cars is extraordinarily difficult — but I also know that if you are an executive or ex-executive of a company that is not Apple, explaining what Apple should, shouldn't, or can't do almost universally backfires. Let's look at some of the more memorable quotes. Dell made his now-infamous quip at a keynote address not long after Steve Jobs returned to Apple in 1997. At a market capitalization of $744 billion, Apple is currently the most valuable company in the world. Perhaps tied for infamy with Dell's remark, Palm CEO Ed Colligan didn't see the iPhone as a serious threat when it was introduced in 2007.

The two views of the design, front and back, should give fans something to both drool and argue over until the first race of the season next month in Australia.  2014 wasn't a banner year for Formula One racing. Ratings were down as fans were up in arms over the move from V8 to V6 engines and controversial changes to the cars' nose design — all while the brand new all-electric series Formula E saw a successful debut.       Perhaps it's a move meant to reclaim some favor from that slighted fanbase. The design could also be Ferrari's way of nudging the sport's directors as the league again stands on the precipice of change. While F1 is about to kick off the 2015 season, it is also nearing a vote on regulation changes for the 2016 season and beyond. Those could include anything from increasing the power of the engines to making the cars and tires wider. Maybe Ferrari's concept is a signpost of a radical new design direction.   While some comparisons could be drawn to the F1 cars of the mid-to-late 1970s, the concept design resembles the look of another flailing motorsport: IndyCar. The F1 concept sports a similar design to the chassis that IndyCar debuted a few years ago with its wide wheel base, low rear wing, and body paneling that runs almost flush to the rear wheels. (It's worth noting that IndyCar also just unveiled slight changes to this look for the 2015 season.) There are some wholly unique features, though. For one, the driver's helmet appears to connect right to the body of the car. Then there's the two-tiered nose and nose wing, which evokes the image of predator about to swallow its prey. And at the rear, the safety light sits in the center of a Batmobile-like oval.   Whatever Formula One decides to do about the look of its cars in 2016, it's unlikely that Ferrari's design will ever make it to the track as we see it here now.

Apple is working on a self-driving car, Reuters reports. An industry insider said Apple is gathering information and parts to make a prototype for a self-driving electric vehicle. Yesterday, a lead from the Wall Street Journal indicated Apple was working on an all-electric vehicle called Project Titan. That report explicitly stated a self-driving car was not part of Apple's plan.  The rumors have been getting stronger all week, and now they've come to a head: WSJ is reporting that Apple is indeed working on a car. ""Project Titan,"" as it's known internally, is an all-electric vehicle that apparently ""resembles a minivan"" in its current iteration and has a team of several hundred people working on it.  Apple is said to be hiring automative tech and vehicle design experts to work at a secret research facility in Silicon Valley, according to Financial Times. There are reportedly now dozens of employees working at the lab, which is said to have been set up some time late last year.

Yet there’s already a rift growing in this young rumor mill: will Cupertino’s take on the future of transportation be capable of driving itself? The Wall Street Journal says no; Reuters says yes. The truth is they’re both likely right.  The apparent disagreement in scoops from two of the world’s preeminent news sources speaks to a PR problem that has been plaguing the auto industry for years. ""Self-driving"" isn’t an atomic, yes-or-no feature; it’s a blanket phrase referring to an entire spectrum of capabilities. Some of those are on the road today and have been for years, others are still just a shade or two shy of science fiction. As Reuters notes, ""Autonomous driving is likely to emerge progressively as driver assistance systems become more sophisticated."" ""Self-driving"" isn’t a yes-or-no feature Even if an Apple car isn’t fully autonomous — something like Google’s vision, lacking even a steering wheel — it won’t ignore autonomous features wholesale. In fact, by the time such a car is on the road, it may not legally be able to ignore them. Some features that fall under the purview of ""self-driving"" are so well established that the federal government has started recommending that automakers include them as standard equipment. So-called crash-imminent braking (CIB) and dynamic braking support (DBS) monitor the road ahead for situations that could cause a collision, and either automatically slow the vehicle down or help the driver apply additional braking to minimize the severity of a crash or prevent it altogether. For a brief, terrifying moment, the car is taking control of a core driving function on the driver’s behalf. But beyond these pre-collision systems, convenience features on a wide variety of modern vehicles combine to closely resemble what you might consider to be ""a self-driving car."" A car with lane-keep and dynamic cruise control, for instance, can automatically stay in its highway lane and maintain a programmed distance behind the cars ahead of it, going all the way down to a standstill in the event of a traffic jam. Such systems are reliable enough nowadays that you can leave the driver’s seat altogether, as one YouTube poster did (unsafely and unwisely):  From there, it’s a small jump to a system that can safely change highway lanes without driver input. The Tesla Model S, with hardware enhancements included since late last year, can change lanes on its own by tapping the turn signal. Tesla has described its short-term goal for automated driving as ""on-ramp to off-ramp,"" meaning that the car takes care of everything while you’re on a highway — it’s only on surface streets that you need to drive on your own. Apple is notoriously deliberate about its approach to adding bells and whistles to its products; it’s rarely a first mover. (Just look at Apple Pay and Touch ID as recent examples — neither feature was first to market, but both are the best implementations in their class.) And no one is suggesting the Apple car is close to release — by all appearances, they just started working on it last year. That’s a blink of an eye on the glacial scale of automotive R&D. By the time an Apple car is on sale, it wouldn’t be viable in the marketplace without some manner of autonomous capability. It’d be akin to selling a car today without a USB port or Bluetooth connectivity, or selling a car in 2016 that doesn’t support either CarPlay or Android Auto. Yes, you might be able to do it, but unless you’re playing in the very bottom end of the market — a place Apple is not known to go — it won’t fly. It would be a shock if Apple aimed for full autonomy with version one Nor is  WSJ wrong when it writes that ""A self-driving car is not part of Apple’s current plan""; in all likelihood, it’s semantics. We’re still many years away from a production car that can reliably (and legally) navigate urban environments, crowded intersections, and complex city traffic patterns in all weather. It would be a shock if Apple aimed for that level of autonomy with version one, but it would be equally surprising if it came to market without the modern basics like pre-collision. Within a couple years, more advanced capabilities like dynamic cruise will become standard fare, too. So yes, paradoxically, an Apple car can be self-driving and be not self-driving at the same time. Reuters can be right, WSJ can be right, everyone wins — except incumbent automakers, perhaps.",0.5185178725802043,0.4814821274197957,0.1841197940227054,813,4.9188191881918817,445,6.1415730337078651,0,0,"Apple, Tech, Transportation, Report"

But budget cutbacks and delays grounded the project in 2012, and in 2013 it was bought back from the US by the original design firm, the UK-based Hybrid Air Vehicles (HAV). Now, a new £3.4 million grant from the UK government could help it off the ground next year, according to HAV. The Airlander can fly for up to five days at a time The UK government's investment in the Airlander appears to less about military surveillance and more about the airship's practicality. For one, it's an extremely green vehicle — it's estimated that it will cost just 10 to 20 percent of what it costs to operate a helicopter. The ship is also capable of carrying around 20,000 pounds of cargo for up to five days at a time without landing (though it was originally supposed to stay aloft for closer to three weeks with smaller cargo loads). Add in the potential for commercial flights, and the overall project could create over 1,800 jobs in the UK. Beyond the investment, the government's innovation agency (Innovate UK) has also helped HAV start a full engine test program. That agency, and specifically its LOCATE (Low Carbon Aircraft Technology Experimentation) program, has not only provided technological support but has helped HAV double its staff in 2014. The 300-foot-long airship is made of carbon fiber, kevlar, and mylar, and its massive frame is able to get off the ground thanks to the lift generated by its shape and the helium inside. Pressurized air pockets help regulate the release of that helium, though it still loses 10 percent of the gas each year. The airship uses diesel fuel to power propellers for steering, taking off, and landing, and each propeller is powered by a 325 hp V8 engine. While there's a wait before the aircraft takes flight once more, HAV has set up a supporters club where fans of the ship can follow its progress and even have their names emblazoned on the hull.

The handle itself is nondescript, but at the bottom there's a blue area where people can pump out hand sanitizer before opening the door. It's trying to tackle illnesses like stomach flu that spread easily on surfaces — ones that people can pick up without even realizing it.  The placement of the sanitizer inside the door handle is a clever design solution, however it could easily be ignored. But the device also comes with software called CountClean that monitors how often people sanitize their hands, and the amount of hand sanitizer in the handle. That lets staff know when sanitizer packs need to be replaced, and — in theory — keep an eye on the overall cleanliness of the facility. Agency of Design has already started trials in US hospitals, and it claims rates of hand sanitizing rose from 22 to 77 percent in those trials. It plans to sell the device for $200 later this year, so we'll have to wait to see if hospitals, schools, libraries, and other places believe that proper placement and monitoring is enough to make people consistently germ-free.

Using what's essentially a large-scale version of a desktop 3D printer, Dus Architects is building what will eventually be a 13-room Dutch canal house made of interlocking plastic parts. The project was announced earlier this year — part proof of concept, part art project. After about three weeks of work, The Guardian reports, one three-meter-high corner segment has been produced. The interior and facade are printed as part of the same brick, and spaces are left for wiring and pipes; for now, the walls are later filled with concrete for insulation and reinforcement. The entire process of printing and assembling the house is slated to take three years. The 3D Print Canal House, as it's called, is conceived as an improvement to current architectural practice on several levels. Designers at Dus say that by printing series of blocks instead of building with conventional materials, they can eliminate waste and reduce transportation costs; the plastic itself can be made with recycled materials. Individual rooms and design elements could be remixed and reordered by non-architects, allowing people to design their own ideal home and then hire a printing contractor to build it. And the rooms themselves can ""fairly easy be disconnected"" to move the house. The pieces are made with an oversized printer called the KamerMaker (or ""room builder""), designed specially for Dus. The site itself is open to tourists, who can visit on most weekdays; President Barack Obama paid a visit earlier this month.  Whether this will truly be the first 3D-printed house is debatable. Enrico Dini is known for building printers that can be used to create large sand structures, and in 2013, he announced that he had teamed up with Dutch architect Janjaap Ruijssenaars on a project called the ""Landscape House,"" a Möbius band-like building with a single surface. Regardless, it's another step towards 3D printing becoming a method for creating not just prototypes but final pieces of design that offer a flexibility traditional manufacturing can't match.

If VPN access shut down as a result, Hunt said, it was purely accidental. A number of VPN services saw a spike in Netflix error rates over the weekend, leading many users to believe the company was cracking down on users trying to hop between regions.

Pricing and purchasing went live today on PonoMusic World store and, as expected, the top of the line 24-bit 192kHz tracks (which Pono is referring to as ""album audio resolution""), can run about double their counterparts on other digital stores. That includes albums like the deluxe edition of Led Zeppelin IV, which goes for $27.49, as opposed to $13.99 on iTunes and $13.49 on Google Play. It's the same story for newer works like Taylor Swift's 1989, which costs $19.79 (versus $12.99 and $12.49 on Apple and Google's stores respectively), despite falling on the lower end of Pono's audio resolution spectrum. It's a little harder to swallow on individual song prices, which can run from $1.99 all the way up to $2.99 a pop, or what you'd pay to watch an hour-long TV program in high definition. And not all tracks can be purchased a la carte, including most of Neil Young's, which require buying the entire album.

A company called Google Compare Auto Insurance Services Inc. is already licensed to do business in more than 25 states, and licensed to sell on behalf of a handful of major insurers like Metlife, Dairyland, and Workmen's. Carney also notices that Compare's corporate treasurer is licensed to do business on behalf of a San Francisco-based insurance broker called Cardhound, which could be a sign that Google is getting ready to acquire the company outright.

In Europe, Google Compare goes beyond simple auto insurance, using the same technology to help users compare mortgage quotes and credit card offers.

O’Neal, who had flown in to reveal the secrets of his personal brand to a rapt audience of marketing executives, sat in the back of the ballroom while the presentation began. Ian Gomar, president of Shaquille O’Neal Consumer Properties, showed the first slide: SHAQUILLE O’NEAL BRAND UPDATE 2015. The state of the Shaquille O’Neal brand is strong. In 2013 O’Neal’s licensing deals brought in $21 million, thanks to a dizzying array of products that span jewelry shops, department stores, and 7-Elevens. He is the face of Buick, IcyHot, and Gold Bond. And 2015 will be even more ambitious: it is the year Shaq reps a new ""sprayable energy drink"" that purports to caffeinate you through skin contact. Countless other branding opportunities loom on the horizon. ""We’re looking at Shaq snacks,"" Gomar tells us. ""We’re obviously talking to Kraft about Shaq ’n’ Cheese."" ""We're obviously talking to Kraft about Shaq & Cheese."" Obviously. CES is first and foremost a convention about physical things: cars, TVs, laptops, accessories. But while products are made by companies, they get sold by brands — that chatty amalgam of ads, sponsored posts, and promoted tweets that blanket the internet. Brands, inarguably, have never been weirder. My favorite Twitter account in ages, Brands Saying Bae, records Taco Bell, Sonic Drive-In, and others mimicking teen speech on Twitter in the hopes that it will drive us to their garbage food. Few of us would ever willingly spray a nameless caffeinated energy drink all over our bodies. But if the drink has Shaq’s smiling face on it, who knows? For one day at CES, I wanted to stop thinking about products and consider instead how they’re sold to us. And so I was happy to learn that Brand Innovators, a community of 6,000 marketers and advertising professionals, were gathering this week to discuss the latest tactics for harvesting wallet-share from millennial trendfluencers like me. (Trendfluencers are a real thing now and there’s nothing you can do about it.) I'm at a conference about #brands and it is exceeding my highest expectations (Cc @ProfJeffJarvis) pic.twitter.com/D84okttHDk  The main thing you learn when you talk to marketers these days is that brands are weird because brands are scared. They’ve never had as much competition for our attention as they do today. A Taco Bell executive at the conference wistfully recalled the days when her team would put together a TV ad, ship it off for broadcast, and call it a day. Now the company’s social media team works around the clock flogging nachos on Twitter using the very best practices the industry has so far devised: Taco Bae.  But in panel after panel, marketers for companies like Walgreens and Coca-Cola admitted that they often don’t know what’s working on social media. A successful TV ad campaign has a clear effect on sales; the value of a viral ""bae"" tweet is much more in doubt. So how to move forward with what everyone in this room calls ""a content strategy""? Does Shaq need a content strategy, or is his celebrity enough?   ""If you get it right, it doesn’t compete with advertising — nuh-uh,"" says David Shing, AOL’s notorious digital prophet, who goes by Shingy. ""It competes with popular culture. That’s the thing we’re trying to win in this war."" Shingy delivers the keynote address at Brand Innovators, and the war metaphor is no joke. Distracting you from whatever you’re doing long enough for a company to make its impression on you has never required more brute force. ""You need to think about your brand as a hack,"" Shingy says. ""You need to think about your brand as a hack."" Shingy hacked his personal brand into our collective consciousness last year after a series of press stories about him played up the more comic aspects of his persona: the absurd job title; its ambiguous responsibilities; his oversized glasses and Troll Doll hair; and his penchant for marketing aphorisms that sound like self-parody. The New Yorker paraphrased a recent speech: ""Everyone is talking about SoLoMo — social, local, mobile — but they should be talking about HoMo: home/mobile, cell phones used on the couch."" I’m always down to talk about HoMo, but I was more curious what advice Shingy had for Shaq. In his keynote, Shingy has but 20 minutes, as he says, ""to ram 1,000 ideas at you."" It is not an understatement: Shingy talks incredibly fast, strafing the audience with word bullets on advertising trends, demographic changes, the growth of various social networks, and his favorite quote from Leonardo Da Vinci. (""Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication."") (It's not a real Da Vinci quote.) He paces back and forth in drop-crotch pants and a paint-splattered jacket; in most of my photographs, he appears as a blur. I make a futile effort to follow the thread of his logic for a few minutes before giving up, turning on my recorder, and deciding to listen to his presentation later at half speed.   When I do, I discover that Shingy is basically free-associating. A slide deck keeps him roughly tethered to his trend forecasting, but the leaps are hard to follow. Here’s about 10 seconds of his talk: ""It’s gonna converge in the home. The connected home’s gonna be this: it’s smart art objects. Beautification is right here, right now. It’s all about celebrating the beautification of objects. So the internet of things? Forget that. It’s the internet of everything. Because what’s gonna happen is the one problem which everyone’s gonna want to talk about here — standards. You’re gonna buy a Toshiba TV, and an LG fridge, and you’re gonna buy some other brands’ things. None of that shit can talk to each other. We need standards."" We need a nap. Shingy tells the audience that the most important medium of the day — ""the one thing that’s hot, hot, hot, if you want to talk about trends, dude"" — is the notification tray on his phone. ""It’s either a text from my babe, or it’s an update from someone I give a shit about,"" as Shingy puts it. He concludes by telling the audience to pursue sound, sight, motion, and ""feel"" in everything they do — both physical feel, like the vibration of a phone, and emotional feel. And then he showed some funny ads. Brands are weird because brands are scared When he took the stage, Shaq shared his own formula for brand success: 70 percent of posts should be funny; 20 percent should be inspiring; and 10 percent should sell things directly. It’s a formula that fits his personality, and he seems to pull it off effortlessly. I fully believe Shaq spends 70 percent of his real life enjoying himself and making jokes; he’s the same person online, and he’s paid handsomely for it. But then again Shaq is a human being, and not everyone in the room this day has that luxury. If you are the disembodied voice of a taco restaurant, or a Walgreens, all you can do is ape human speech and hope for enough Facebook shares to justify your marketing budget. And if everything goes wrong with your brand, consider becoming a digital prophet. I’ve seen the prophet’s work up close. There’s nothing to it.

The US company announced partnerships with eight European newspapers — including The Guardian and The Financial Times — as well as a $163 million pot (€150 million) to fund ""innovation in digital journalism"" over the next three years. The announcement comes at a time of heightened tensions between Google and European institutions, with the European Union formally accusing the company of monopolistic search practices earlier this month. Although the charges do not cover the news industry, publishers in Europe have been criticizing Google's business practices in the market for years — especially the company's habit of aggregating stories to appear in searches and Google News. ""We've made some mistakes along the way."" ""I firmly believe that Google has always wanted to be a friend and partner to the news industry, but I also accept we’ve made some mistakes along the way,"" said Carlo D'Asaro Biondo, Google's president of strategic partnerships in Europe, during an event in London transcribed in Google's European policy blog. ""We recognize that technology companies and news organizations are part of the same information ecosystem. We want to play our part in the common fight to find more sustainable models for news."" Creating these ""sustainable models"" is the challenge for both Google and publishers. Although, as Biondo notes, the digital business model of traffic, advertising, and subscriptions is working for some English-language papers (publications like The Guardian, The New York Times, and The Daily Mail have all been able to expand to new audiences), the battle is more difficult for smaller publishers whose audience is limited by their language. In some cases, Google might find that increasing traffic — and the advertising revenue that goes with it — can only help so much. ""We are cautiously optimistic,"" said Mathias Blumencron, digital editor at German paper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung — one of the partners in Google's new scheme. ""The main goal for publishers is this: can we find sustainable mechanisms that can finance quality journalism in the digital world? If we can, then the initiative is a success. If not, then we will leave."" Google claims ""publishers are in control."" However, although Google has a vested interest in helping news publications succeed (news is a staple product that draws users to its services), it's clear that underlying tensions remain. For example, Biondo claims that ""publishers are in control"" of Google News because they can opt out at any time. However, when German publishers did exactly that in November last year, traffic to their sites dropped so sharply they reversed their decision in two weeks. Similarly, when Spanish lawmakers attempted to charge Google for aggregating news stories, the US company simply stopped operating Google News in Spain. This new investment fund may show that Google is willing to work with European publishers, but the US company is not going to forget its own interests either.",0.6933258984702694,0.3066741015297306,0.9050090169716231,506,5.3181818181818183,298,6.325503355704698,0,0,"Google, Tech, US & World"

In many cases, the companies involved didn't know about the threat until it had been alive in their systems for months. For many industry observers, the most painful point is the timing: If the industry had raised the alarm when the first warning signs surfaced, the worst of the damage could have been averted. That idea seems to have gotten Washington's attention. In February, President Obama signed an executive order to promote information sharing on cyberthreats, and a new crop of information-sharing bills in Congress look to clear the path even further. Last week, the House of Representatives passed the Protecting Cyber Networks Act, which would establish new sharing guidelines and liability protections, and the Senate is expected to take up the bill in the coming weeks. At the same time, many see PCNA and other bills like it as an unprecedented intrusion into otherwise neutral networks — what Ron Wyden described as ""a surveillance bill by another name."" While most researchers still see themselves as engineers, there's a growing fear that these new measures will turn them into detectives. ""A surveillance bill by another name"" The result is one of the more puzzling privacy fights in recent memory, as Congress looks to legally authorize the information sharing that's already taking place, and privacy advocates say the bills in question aren't about sharing information at all. So what's wrong with the way data is shared, and how do the new bills plan to fix it? And more importantly, can they do it without turning network operators into spies? There's already a lot of information sharing in the cybersecurity world, but it tends to happen on an informal basis, and federal agencies like the FBI are often last on the list. Only a few attackers will be eye-catching enough for a public report, so the rest tend to travel through a patchwork of smaller listservs, each covering a specific issue like DNS security or DDoS mitigation. Rodney Joffe, a senior vice president at Neustar, says he works across dozens of such channels, and the result is effective but overwhelming. ""I'm continually dragging my deck chair from one campfire to another,"" Joffe says. What's appropriate in one channel might be too sensitive for another, and for many of the participants, the sharing ends up happening without official corporate approval. ""In many cases, the company doesn't know that there are these backchannels keeping the wheels on the bus,"" Joffe says. The information being shared is usually simple — a specific, easily defended attack, or the latest style of phishing email — but getting it to all the right people can be complex, particularly when trade secrets or breach disclosure laws are involved. At its least controversial, the new info-sharing bills are meant to solve that problem, cutting a legal path through the complex web of privacy and disclosure laws. ""The company doesn't know that there are these backchannels keeping the wheels on the bus."" But the bills also take a new approach to the people behind those attacks. For law enforcement agencies, the point of tracking a threat is to catch the criminals behind it, not just to fix the vulnerability that let them get in. If there's technical evidence in the wake of an attack like Target, agencies like the FBI want to use that evidence to find the parties responsible, and hopefully throw them in jail. That's a shift from the current research landscape, which generally sees attribution as secondary to patching vulnerabilities and identifying malicious code, but many in government see it as a necessary change. It's also a priority for President Obama, who laid out the plan in his 2009 Cyberspace Policy Review, a document that insiders say is still guiding the White House's agenda in the area. ""Key elements of the private sector have indicated a willingness to work toward a framework under which the government would pursue malicious actors,"" reads one passage from the review. That shift is reflected in the text of the bill itself. The bill requires reasonable measures to remove personal information, but only ""information identifying a specific person not directly related to a cybersecurity threat."" If you're related to the threat, then collecting your personal information is part of the point: how else will they figure out who's responsible? ""Waiving privacy rights will not make security sharing better."" At the same time, much of the security community sees the drive to catch criminals as a distraction from the more important work of securing systems. On April 16th, 67 different security researchers and technologists signed onto an open letter against the new bills, arguing the measures would do little to prevent attacks. ""Private information about individual users is often a detriment in developing threat signatures because we need to be able to identify an attack no matter where it comes from and no matter who the target is,"" the letter reads. ""Waiving privacy rights will not make security sharing better."" As long as point-of-sale terminals are vulnerable, someone will be there to exploit them; catch one group of online thieves, and another group will take their place. The only way to stop the thefts is to fix the vulnerability itself. The precise definition of ""cybersecurity threat"" has also caused concern among many privacy advocates. Fraud or terrorism suspects could also potentially be classified as threats, drawing network security workers into a much broader range of investigations. ""This is the heart of why it's a cybersurveillance bill,"" says Drew Mitnick, a cyberpolicy analyst at Access, an internet-rights advocacy group. ""We don't want businesses to feel like they need to investigate these crimes that are totally unrelated to the network security services they're providing."" It's still unclear whether those objections will be enough to sink the new legislation. Unlike CISPA, President Obama has publicly supported the new bill, and the recent string of high-profile hacks seems to have forged a rare bipartisan consensus on the issue. The House has already done its part, and the bills will be heading to the Senate in the weeks to come, where new privacy measures may be added. But it’s hard to say whether those measures will be enough, and it will be difficult for any info-sharing bill to split the difference between patching vulnerabilities and chasing criminals. Whatever happens in Congress, that larger split may be much harder to fix.",0.49004988731560917,0.5099501126843908,0.5088263442029011,1105,5.1321266968325796,578,6.3840830449826989,0,0,"Policy & Law, US & World, Report"

Although the overwhelming majority of PC gamers run Windows, it would be fair to say that their relationship with Microsoft has been fraught throughout the years. The disastrous Games for Windows Live initiative was a tone-deaf attempt to turn online gaming on Windows Vista into an Xbox-like experience. Windows 8, meanwhile, brought an unfriendly interface and a half-hearted App Store pricing model, which was met with a collective shrug by countless gamers worldwide who stuck with Windows 7. Valve CEO Gabe Newell told The Verge that “Windows 8 was like this giant sadness” that “just hurts everybody in the PC business.” Minecraft creator Notch said, “I’d rather have Minecraft not run on Windows 8 at all than play along” with Microsoft’s attempt to sell games itself. Now, Microsoft is making a fresh push into PC gaming with Windows 10, and it comes at an interesting time for the company’s Xbox ambitions. Following the troubled launch of Windows 8, Microsoft proceeded to torpedo Xbox’s reputation by making its new console less powerful than the PlayStation 4, more expensive due to a mandatory Kinect bundle of dubious value, and more focused on entertainment features to the detriment of gaming. “It was a tough time for the team, a tough time for what we were trying to do with Xbox,” says Microsoft’s Xbox chief Phil Spencer in an interview with The Verge. “Because a lot of the original ideas around Xbox One didn’t meet the expectations that Xbox fans have of what we should do with our product.” But after taking over from Don Mattrick, Spencer’s gamer-focused approach has started to pay off after hard decisions like unbundling Kinect; Microsoft’s E3 keynote last month was universally well received. So it’s on this tentative surge of momentum that Microsoft is putting the Xbox brand at the heart of Windows 10, with an expansive new Xbox app and a long list of gaming features. “We’re taking the Xbox team and really thinking about it as the gaming team in Microsoft,” says Spencer. “Where Xbox is our gaming brand and it’s less solely about the console itself and more about the gaming ecosystem all up — whether you’re playing on a PC, whether you’re playing on your phone, whether you’re playing on your console."" But, quite understandably, PC gamers might prove a hard bunch to convince. Every Windows 10 installation includes the Xbox app, a major attempt by Microsoft to put its stamp on the PC gaming experience. It has much in common with the basic Xbox One interface — in fact, if you have an Xbox One, almost everything you see will be pulled from there. Your friends list, software library, and achievements are accessible through the app, as are features like messaging and party chat. The middle of the app is dominated by an activity feed that shows what you and your friends have been up to in chronological order. You’re also able to connect to your Xbox One directly, control it from your PC, and stream games straight to your computer’s monitor. This is a cool feature that seems easy to set up, but I’ve been unable to get it to work — the Xbox app crashes every time I try to start a game. (Other Verge colleagues have had better luck.) It’s a shame, because I’ve gotten used to decoupling my Wii U and PlayStation 4 from the TV by beaming them to secondary screens. All of these features are potentially neat for Xbox One owners, but the problem is that the vast majority of PC gamers don’t own an Xbox One — and at this point, the Xbox app is only really useful if you do. Here’s an example: I own a Steam copy of Ori and the Blind Forest, a game that launched this year on Xbox One and PC with considerable backing from Microsoft. If I play Ori in Windows 10, there are some things I can do through the Xbox app; pressing Win-G or the Xbox home button on my controller to take screenshots or record footage, for instance. But attempting to share those images or videos from the Xbox app brings up an error message that the game hasn’t been recognized. ""Try making a capture from a newer game,"" says the optimistic pop-up. So the Xbox app only really works best, or at all, if you buy most of your games through Microsoft. But right now, the company isn’t making much of an effort to make that a possibility. There is a Store button in the Xbox app, but all it does is launch the Windows 8-era store and jump to the games section. Xbox Live-enabled games didn’t exactly take off on Windows 8; as of today the store is populated with little more than mobile ports and Microsoft’s new, social versions of games like Minesweeper and Mahjong. The one big Windows 10 game to hit the store today is a new version of Minecraft, ironically enough given Notch’s prior statements on the Windows Store. But Microsoft can do things like that when it buys a studio for $2 billion. The problem with trying to own a slice of the PC ecosystem is that there’s a de facto ruler already: Steam. The PC’s open nature is one of its biggest strengths — Spencer correctly points out that Minecraft’s success came down to ""a dude just creates a Java app, throws it up with a PayPal link, and all of a sudden it becomes massive."" But in practice, most PC gamers are so entrenched in their Steam libraries that almost anything else is an unwelcome distraction. You’d be hard pressed to find anyone who enjoys firing up EA’s Origin or Ubisoft’s Uplay just to launch games from each publisher. But Microsoft believes the Xbox ecosystem has something unique to add to Windows. ""Back in the day with Games for Windows [Live] when it was out, really there was a sentiment inside the Xbox group that if we could only get those Windows people to play games on the console, that would help us sell more Xboxes,"" says Spencer. ""I love selling more Xboxes. [But] more than selling more Xboxes, I love having people have fun on Xbox Live. I look at the opportunity on Windows to connect the ecosystems."" ""Five years from now I want Steam to be incredibly popular and successful."" For existing Steam users who don’t care about the Xbox One, it’s unlikely that Microsoft will be able to propel its Xbox-on-Windows initiative beyond an occasionally-opened annoyance. But it may be able to get a foothold through the tried and true method of exclusive content. Microsoft has indicated that it’ll bring upcoming Xbox One titles like Fable Legends, Gears of War: Ultimate Edition, and Gigantic to Windows 10, with features like cross-platform multiplayer and the integration into the Xbox app that Steam games will miss out on. Looking at that lineup, though, it’s hard not to get the feeling that Microsoft’s gaming ambitions remain centered around selling Xbox consoles. Why no Halo 5: Guardians? Why no Gears of War 4? Why no Forza Motorsport 6? Microsoft doesn’t seem too invested in the concept of a PC gaming store, let alone the prospect of taking on Steam. ""Steam is massive and they’ve been incredibly important to the Windows gaming ecosystem,"" says Spencer. ""Five years from now I want Steam to be incredibly popular and successful. We don’t have a strategy that Steam somehow takes anything from us. I look at the health of Steam as a harbinger of the health of Windows gaming."" But even if the Windows Store never takes off, that doesn’t mean there’s nothing in Windows 10 to interest PC gamers. DirectX 12 will be a big deal when it’s adopted fully; the latest version of Microsoft’s gaming API will take better advantage of multi-core processors and multiple GPUs to offer potentially much stronger performance. AMD, which makes the CPU and GPU inside the Xbox One and PlayStation 4, says its new R9 390 GPU could show up to 15 times the theoretical detail under DirectX 12 than 11 — though you won’t necessarily need new hardware to see the benefits. (I should also note that I haven’t had any problems getting existing PC games to run well on Windows 10, which was an issue for many when Windows 8 launched.) And for console gamers, some of the benefits of Windows 10 will also trickle down to the Xbox One. Spencer says that universal Windows apps will finally come to the Xbox this fall, and a unified store will follow. Shifting the underlying Xbox One operating system to Windows 10 — along with a dramatic UI overhaul — should improve performance, too. ""Sometimes we see spinning circles more often than we would like, when we’re navigating the Xbox,"" he says. ""There’s a lot of work that we’re doing to streamline — and we’re getting a lot of the usage data of really how an Xbox One is being used now — to streamline the UI. Windows 10 is making the Xbox UI faster, which is great."" It’s also worth noting, of course, that Windows 10 is the best-designed and most usable version of Windows in recent memory, and that if you do anything with your PC beyond gaming you’ll probably want to upgrade at some point anyway. It’s free, after all. But while Windows 10 itself seems likely to succeed, Microsoft’s gaming strategy remains harder to pin down. For Xbox One owners, Windows 10 comes with a bunch of neat features and integration. But if you’re a PC-only gamer, you may get more of a sense that Microsoft is trying to sell you an Xbox.",0.5337063183912455,0.4662936816087545,0.1567250128245078,1635,4.7467889908256877,713,6.1023842917251052,0,6,"Culture, Entertainment, Gaming, Microsoft, Tech, Report"

Where popcorn movies of previous eras installed Nazis, Soviets, space aliens, and zombies, we get a horde of tech CEOs. Today a press image revealed the new look of Lex Luthor in the upcoming Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice. In the still, one of comics' most iconic villains swaps his familiar bespoke suit for a sports jacket, T-shirt, and fitted jeans. Luthor is merely the latest troublemaker to wear the relaxed uniform and smarmy grin of startup founders. Kingsman: The Secret Service, a recent twist on the James Bond formula, featured Samuel L. Jackson as a Mark Zuckerberg-like megalomaniac with a strange lisp, an affinity for fresh baseball caps, and a plan to kill millions of people via free mobile internet service. In films like Ex Machina and video games like Grand Theft Auto V, antagonists were a smidgen subtler, given the boyish personalities, childish outfits, and futurist philosophies familiar to anyone who's waited in line for a San Francisco grilled cheese food truck. Prepare for battle with an army of disruptors DC Comics isn't even the first comic movie maker to capitalize on Silicon Valley angst. The nemeses of Marvel's Iron Man trilogy have skewed toward malicious technologists. And protagonist Tony Stark — ever his own worst enemy — is the quintessential example of Silicon Valley ambition snowballing into real-world problems. While he doesn't wear a business hoodie, he is a wealthy, famous tech industry CEO whose unflinching faith in technology ultimately leads to a sentient AI nearly destroying the world. What's jarring about the reimagined Lex Luthor is the filmmakers' decision to be so on the nose. Luthor is played by Jesse Eisenberg, who established himself by playing, who else, Zuckerberg in The Social Network. Whatever remains of the thinly veiled comparison is shredded by the costume and set departments: the ""I'm not The Man"" tennis shoes, the fussy hair, the warmly lit signage that would fit in Pinterest's headquarters. In terms of evildoers, we could do worse Zuckerberg is a better model for villains than the purely evil Nazis, or the singularly focused zombies that populated genre films in the past. His quirky, wunderkind personality and determination to save the world with an undiluted blend of capitalism and libertarian views, allows characters modeled in his image to be well-intentioned people who do wrong in the Machiavellian pursuit of greatness. Nor is it a surprise that tech leaders have taken the crown of default movie bad guy. Summer blockbusters, particularly grim superhero films, are determined to be more complex and realistic than action films of the past — but not so complex as to tackle the United States' enemies abroad, which aren't nearly as clear cut as they were in the 20th century. Plus, audiences can relate to the tech CEO: a young person with big ideas, who wants to change to the world, and who dresses like everybody else. And yet, the audience is giddy to turn on the tech CEO: impossibly wealthy, eager to shape the nation's politics, and maddeningly egotistical. They're built with the dramatic simplicity of Greek myths and the visual familiarity of a cartoon character. Just look at that picture of Lex Luthor; we don't need text to tell us who this guy is. When it comes to evildoers, we could do worse. Our villains could be xenophobic depictions of Middle Easterners from the early 1990s or the Native Americans of classic westerns. In fact, I'll go so far as to say we should be grateful for the villains of our time. Tech CEOs are less evil than Nazis, more human than zombies, more approachable than Soviet spies, and yet they very well could destroy this planet in the pursuit of a better IPO.",0.5806610013915928,0.4193389986084072,0.1784073289469069,631,4.9667194928684628,396,6.0909090909090908,0,0,

The original film has developed a cult status over the past 14 years, but another project featuring the film's creators and many of its stars has been overlooked. I hope to, in some small part, change that.  This is an introduction to Stella — a guide for people whose favorite part of Wet Hot American Summer is the drug-induced trip to town. What is Stella? A three-person comedy troupe consisting of David Wain, Michael Ian Black, and Michael Showalter.   Is Stella funny? I think so. The group's most accessible 5-minute short, which stars Paul Rudd, is a handy test. If the dick and shit jokes don't hit their mark, Stella probably isn't for you. If you're like, ""This was good, but would be better if they tripled down on the dick and shit stuff,"" then oh just you wait. Have a look for yourself:  Here's the rub. I love the dick and shit jokes — I really do — but I'm also a stickler for integrity in the media. Is there some sort of conflict of interest slushing beneath this piece, like a frozen river of bias? Yes. My wife has worked for Wain, Showalter, and Black at different points in her career.   They haven't, like, bought you a donut or anything, have they? Black once bought me a peanut butter and jelly donut, but then left the donut at his hotel, so I never ate the donut.   I appreciate your transparency, especially about that donut. Continue with the brass tacks. Thanks. Long before I met the trio, around 2003 or so, high school me discovered the raunchy Stella videos online. The sketches had been uploaded to Stella's site after they appeared in the troupe’s regular live show at Fez, one of countless Lower East Side clubs that no longer exists. Like Fez, Stella was of its time. Three young comedians fresh off a television contract, suddenly free of corporate guidelines, make absurd, spitfire, filthy comedy in a small club. They could get away with anything, so they did.  Anything? Like, they could build an entire sketch about David Wain having passionate sex with his cousin, and it wouldn't really become a thing on Twitter.   I see what you mean. I see. What. You. Mean.  Hey pal, any chance I know these guys from somewhere? Well pal, if you’re over 30, you probably remember all three from The State, the aforementioned sketch show, which ran on MTV in the early 1990s. Other members of The State include Ken Marino, Joe Lo Truglio, and Thomas Lennon.   Whatever happened to The State?  The State cast — 11 members large — couldn't remain a colossal sketch unit forever, not at that size. After The State went off the air, the comedians formed smaller sub-groups for projects like Reno 911, Viva Variety, and of course, Wet Hot American Summer, written by Wain and Showalter.   I love that movie! I can't wait for the Netflix show to premiere! Same here!  Wait a gosh darn minute. Is the episodic prequel to Wet Hot American Summer, premiering this week on Netflix, just a peg on which the author may hang his Stella fandom? Journalistically speaking, sure. Though this story will feature plenty of other pegs. Wink.   Why'd you just wink at me? Stella made a lot of pegging jokes before pegging was the material of brunch conversation.   You were making a pun. Mhmm.   Okay, let's say I'm younger than 30: how do I know these guys?  Wain was the director of Wanderlust, They Came Together, and Role Models. Showalter wrote the IFC film The Baxter, and co-wrote and starred in Michael and Michael Have Issues with Michael Ian Black. That show, which aired on Comedy Central, was also written by Kumail Nanjiani (Silicon Valley) and Jessi Klein (head writer and executive producer for Inside Amy Schumer). Black has written a number of books and films, including Run, Fatboy, Run, and is  currently a regular on The Jim Gaffigan Show and Another Period, which also stars Wain. Come on, you've watched at least one of those things on your laptop.   Who uses a laptop? I only use the mobile web. Truth.   I'm looking at these Stella videos on my phone and there's something weird going on. Did my contacts dry up? No, your contacts are perfectly moist. The bits are 15 years old, so my recommendation comes with some caveats. For one, Stella's entire web oeuvre was made before YouTube. The audio and video have a ""slightly better than a home movie"" quality.   Something else is off, and I just can't... quite... I don't know what it is about them, but I feel kind of guilty finding parts of this funny. That's the other issue: A handful of the bits that I loved in high school don't quite work today. Maybe I think they're too repellant. Or maybe I'm just old. I see why some people might take offense to some jokes. I think there's a value even in the most dated shorts. Stella's videos speak to their time and place in popular culture, anthropological evidence of how the rise of YouTube and its strict content policies, along with the surge of progressive culture — both for better and worse — have changed what we expect and accept from web comedy. Stella is an artifact from this brief window when the ease of web video production allowed comedians to make things too offensive to get past film and television ratings boards, and before a time when they would consider making different jokes all together, rather than including a throwaway gag at the expense of good taste or human decency.  Is Stella really that offensive? No, not really. Or at least, I don't think so. It's just that there's so much humor involving sex and gender, and I feel no way equipped to unpack it. I'll leave that criticism for someone else.   Why do you like Stella so much? If movies like Airplane and Top Secret are parodies of genre movies, Stella is a parody of middle-class life. The targets are as big and soft now as they were then: boring wine conversations, workspace chatter, empty referential humor. A recurring line is, ""I believe in God. I mean, I don’t know if he’s a guy with a long, white beard or anything, but I do believe there’s something out there."" I think I've heard someone say that near the end of every office holiday party.   They're poking fun at... Our need to constantly be saying something because we're terrified conversation will lull for even a second, and everyone will realize we're total frauds. The home video production quality adds to the effect. At the end of the first skit, you can hear the guys laughing off camera. In another skit, Showalter mugs right into the lens. Stella shorts play like inside joke videos you might have shot with friends in college, except outsiders don't have to be in on any secret backstory to enjoy the punchlines.   Isn't that too deep of a read? Aren't you doing the thing the videos are making fun of? Definitely. Is Stella like anything else I watch? Kind of, but not really. But kind of. But mostly not really. Like It's Always Sunny in Philedelphia, the leads are despicable monsters who do bad things, but you sort of love them for that. And tonally, the videos hits some of the same notes as Kids in the Hall. Stella is like a series of vaudeville comedy bits strung together by the thinnest excuse for a plot. Take for example the first episode: the gang goes hunting, but really that's just one long series of goofs that set up an extended corpse-humping joke.   That's what you meant by ""sex humor""? That's just the tip of the corpse-humping iceberg.   You mean someone humps a corpse again? Two episodes later a half-dozen men and women hump a dead man, recently struck by a car, while telling that dirty boy how much he likes it.   Does anybody hump an iceberg? No.   Say I'm the sort of person who wants something like that corpse-humping stuff, but even more alienating?  So, the most divisive Stella bit, by far, stars Zack Galifianakis as Santa Claus. You get to see his tushy. It's called ""Searching for Santa,"" and I'm not going to embed it, because I know someone will screencap a certain scene appearing on the site and that would be bad for everybody.   What's so bad about ""Searching for Santa""? Cannibalism, a Gaza joke, and also a lengthy scene in which all three members of Stella suck Mrs. Claus' fake penis on camera.   Follow-up question: What's the second most alienating sketch? Probably ""Thanksgiving 1621,"" because of some Native American jokes and a scene in which Joe Lo Truglio (Brooklyn Nine-nine) gives A.D. Miles (head writer for The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon) a hand job under the table, and we see the hand job, except instead of a penis there’s a big, black dildo.   I'm noticing a theme. Yes, they're really into holidays. Is there a Stella sketch I can watch at work? ""A Day Off from Work"" is the least offensive Stella video. It’s just the guys playing with a dog in slow-motion for two and a half minutes.   That's it? Comedy Central produced one season of a Stella television show called Stella. Less crude, but for the most part, just as funny. The whole season is for sale on DVD on Amazon.   Will we ever see the original videos on DVD or Blu-ray? The Stella videos were collected about a decade ago for a now out-of-print DVD release called Stella Shorts 1998–2002. We probably won't see another run of that DVD, let alone a Blu-ray print. There’s rampant use of unlicensed music throughout the videos, including songs from Alanis Morissette, James Taylor, Toad the Wet Sprocket, and ""Seasons of Love"" from the musical Rent.   Then where can I watch everything? Currently, all 25 videos are available on their barebones website.   Perfect. I'll give them a watch when I'm not at the office. Good plan.   Hey, any chance you have a clipping from the July 1997 issue of New York Magazine promoting their weekly show?  Funny you should ask, because I do.

Phil Spencer, Microsoft's Xbox chief, took over the role around a year ago and he has re-centered the company's focus on gaming. In an interview with The Verge, Spencer has shared some of his vision around the future of the entertainment features in the Xbox One. While as much time is spent watching entertainment on an Xbox console as playing games, Microsoft appears to be looking at new ways to bring entertainment features to the Xbox. ""We probably have taken a little different approach than we did at launch,"" admits Spencer. ""We've been thinking a lot about over-the-top and over-the-air conent and how the aggregation of all your content in this un-bundled world that people seem to be living in."" Part of that has seen the company launch Xbox One digital TV tuners, and Spencer says the company will continue down that type of path. ""I'm not sure we have as much value to add there."" ""Whether I think I'm going to become an additive thing to your cable box... I'm not sure we have as much value to add there in the long run where I think about where the space is going."" That's not surprising. Almost every Xbox executive we profiled for its TV integration has left the company. While the Xbox One promised deep interactive TV integration, the result has been a mix of IR blasters and UI on top of cable boxes. Spencer now sees Xbox adding value in helping people find the right TV show or the ability to watch content streamed from an Xbox to other devices. ""We see what people do on the box and we know making advances in the entertainment space is important,"" he says. ""You'll hear more from us soon actually about that."" Rumors have suggested Microsoft is working on a DVR feature for the Xbox One to let you record TV shows. With Microsoft planning a bigger presence at the Gamescom event next week, it's possible we'll see some announcements around entertainment. ""I think there are natural features that you could see where an Xbox could do a god job helping, especially in a world where you have video sources from all over the place,"" teases Spencer.

Ouya's distinctive Android console wasn't part of the deal, but Razer is getting the rights to Ouya's software, as well as its technical and developer relations teams. It's a lifeline for Ouya, which will be spun into a publishing service for Razer's own Android console. It's a boon for Razer, which is getting access to 1,500 Android TV games and said publishing platform. But for some developers who bet on the console, it might be a disaster. Polygon and Motherboard have spoken to multiple developers who qualified for money from the Free the Games Fund, a $1 million initiative that supported Kickstarter-funded Ouya games. The fund was launched in 2013, and the money was supposed to be paid out after milestones that included releasing a beta, launching the game, and completing an exclusivity period of one to six months. Ouya is said to be invoking a recently added bankruptcy clause While Ouya hasn't spoken about the future of the fund, developers say they've been told that they won't receive any more money. That's reportedly because of a clause that lets Ouya or a studio break the contract if one of them goes bankrupt or dissolves. ""Claiming Ouya no longer exists as a company to get out of funding commitments, while continuing to use the name in the announcements today as if they still are a company that exists, just stinks,"" one developer told Polygon. According to Motherboard, the clause was added earlier this year; Ouya has reportedly been seeking a buyer since at least April. The Free the Games fund offered matching grants between $10,000 and $250,000, so losing even a quarter of a pledge could take a substantial chunk out of an indie studio's budget. The fund, which was meant to build out Ouya's catalog, has caused problems for the company before — developers allegedly started funding their own Kickstarter projects to game the matching system, causing them to overhaul the rules two months after launch. A Razer spokesperson told Motherboard that it had not acquired the Free the Games Fund in its deal with Ouya, declining to comment on the state of the grants. In a later comment to Polygon, however, Razer CEO Min-Liang Tan said that Razer would be picking up Ouya's tab. According to Razer, $620,000 of the original $1 million has still not been paid out, generally because developers hadn't yet hit milestones. The specifics have not been worked out, but Razer will honor a modified version of the deal with any developers still participating in the fund. While the Ouya agreement required a period of exclusivity, Razer will let developers sell their game on any platform. However, they'll also have to make up the funds by giving away games over Razer's Cortex store. (As Polygon explains it, if they receive $10,000 for a game that costs $10, they'd need to give away 1,000 copies.)

Direct Messenger is an unofficial Twitter app with a singular purpose — it lets you send and receive Direct Messages. Once you link Direct Messenger to your Twitter account, the home screen shows you a list of your previously exchanged Direct Messages. Clicking the compose message button pulls up a list of your Twitter followers, and the app gives you a number of ways to communicate with them, including text, emoji, images, location, and even a dedicated button that brings up a cute animated heart and causes it to float around the screen. Twitter doesn’t support these messaging formats But don't expect the target of your DM to see what you see — Twitter itself doesn’t support these messaging formats. When you try to send an image via Direct Messenger, the app converts the image into a link, meaning that unless the person you're messaging also has the app installed, all they see is a link with a message that reads ""Sent an image via Direct Messenger.""

The test interprets patients’ ""breath prints"" — unique patterns of molecules that we breathe in and out everyday and reflect conditions in the body. Similar tests have already been developed to detect other types of cancer, but scientists say the method is especially important for stomach or gastric cancer because of the disease’s relatively low profile in the West. The breath test was 92 percent accurate In a study published in the journal Gut, a group of scientists led by Hossam Haick tested breath samples from 484 Latvians. Close to a hundred of these people had been diagnosed with stomach cancer but hadn’t started treatment, while the rest were sorted into groups by their risk for developing the cancer. The breath test — known as a ""nanoarray analysis"" — was 92 percent accurate when it came to identifying patients with cancer among symptomatic and non-symptomatic patients. The scientists involved say it could replace the more invasive methods currently used to identify the disease. Stomach cancer can only be cured with invasive methods like surgery, and even then, only if doctors recognize it early. While stomach cancer is the fifth most common type of cancer globally, it’s only the 16th most common in the US. (This is due to a clutch of factors, including, but not limited to, diet and the presence of common bacteria named Helicobacter pylori.) Usually by the time it's identified, the cancer has already spread to other parts of the body. This means that in the US, for example, only 28 percent of individuals with the disease survive five years after diagnosis. Only two countries —Japan and South Korea — currently screen for stomach cancer, mostly because the disease isn’t as common in the West. The fifth most common cancer globally Approximately two-thirds of gastric cancer cases are diagnosed late, says Marcis Leja, one of the scientists behind the new screening method. Globally, he says, there are close to a million new cases every year, and that as cancers go, it's quite a ""neglected"" problem. Current screening methods involve inserting a camera down the throat into the stomach. However, if individuals don’t have any symptoms for the disease, then they’ll be unlikely to want to undergo these sorts of invasive examinations, says Leja. He adds that the new breath analysis method is cheaper, faster, and easier to perform than existing methods. To take the test, patients simply exhale into a tube, with this sample fed over a series of sensors. These sensors are made of two components — an organic film that reacts to the presence of certain molecules, and a second layer that converts this reaction into an electrical signal. In the future, say Haick and Leja, these sensors will be built directly into the breathing tube, allowing doctors to administer the test like a breathalyzer, with the procedure taking only minutes. Breath tests have been around since the Roman times Although this may sound like a roundabout way to examine what’s going on inside the body, these sorts of tests have actually been in use since Roman times. Liver failure, for example, meant the breath had a fishy odor, while diabetes was associated with a sweet, acetone smell. To test the new technology though, scientists were using more than just their sense of smell. To verify the findings of the nanoarray analysis, the breath samples were also examined using mass spectrometry. This process can accurately identify different chemicals, but is too expensive and time-consuming to be used to screen for cancer. Instead, the mass spectrometry allowed the scientists to create a template of what patterns of molecules the nanoarray analysis had to look for. ""The [breath test] doesn’t identify particular substances,"" Leja explains. ""Instead it allows us to identify the pattern. It’s taught to discriminate between disease and non-disease and other cases."" While the scientists involved described the test’s accuracy as ""excellent,"" the technology did have a 2 percent rate of false positives (that is, in 2 percent of cases it said the patient had cancer when they didn’t). However, the nanoarray analysis also proved adept at identifying precancerous stomach conditions. ""Identification of high-risk conditions is a secondary task, although from the clinical point could be even sometimes more important,"" Leja says. ""It has a lot of promise but it's very preliminary."" ""It has a lot of promise but it’s very preliminary,"" said Dr. Jean-Marie Houghton, a spokesperson for the American Gastroenterological Association from the University of Massachusetts Medical School. ""It needs to be tested out in larger and more diverse populations, but as an early go it’s very encouraging."" But breath analysis won’t become widespread unless it’s accurate among large portions of the population, Houghton says. It’s likelier that the test would become a supplementary tool, deployed in situations where patients’ environmental conditions or genetic disposition suggests they might be at risk of having stomach cancer,  but when they don’t actually show any symptoms. ""If you wouldn’t otherwise be doing an endoscopy, I can see this being very useful,"" says Houghton. Leja, Haick, and the rest of their team led by the doctorate student Haitham Amal are already working on the next generation of the device. ""Definitely we have to prove that the study works in other populations, and that will take a couple of years even in an optimistic scenario,"" says Leja. ""But in absolute figures, gastric cancer is not going to decline in the foreseeable future.""",0.41319734732384933,0.5868026526761507,0.4931254968142785,929,5.2228202368137779,472,6.4639830508474576,0,0,Science

That's why scientists are turning to another location sensor already widespread in many countries: the smartphone.  A single smartphone makes for a crappy earthquake sensor — but get enough of them reporting, and it won't matter. A new study, published today in Science Advances, says that the right network of cell phones might be able to substitute for modern seismograph arrays, providing a crucial early warning in the event of a quake. The study looks at historical earthquake data and modern smartphone hardware (based on the Nexus 5) and comes away with a map of how a smartphone-based earthquake detector might work. As it turns out, a phone's GPS is more powerful than you might think. A modern phone has almost everything you could want in an earthquake sensor Early warning systems are designed to pick up the first tremors of an earthquake, projecting where the incoming quake is centered and how strong it's likely to be. When they work, the systems are able to give citizens and first responders crucial time to prepare for the quake. There are already seismograph-based systems in place in California, Mexico, and Japan, but poorer countries often don't have the means to implement and maintain them. This new method wouldn’t be as good as most scientific earthquake sensors, but those can cost tens of thousands of dollars each, making a smartphone-based sensor a lot cheaper. For countries that can’t afford a seismograph-based system (which includes much of the Southern Hemisphere), it could make a crucial difference in catching quakes early. A modern phone has almost everything you could want in an earthquake sensor: specifically, a GPS-powered location sensor, an accelerometer, and multiple data connections. There are also a lot of them, even in poor countries, so a distributed system could count on getting data points from multiple angles. Of course, a phone moves around a lot more than a traditional earthquake sensor, but the hope is that what phones lose in quality, they can make up for in quantity. Given that there will likely be millions of phones in the vicinity of a quake, researchers hope there will be a few thousand that will be in a position to serve as earthquake sensors. Even with less accurate GPS sensors, those phones could still be very good at picking up geological shifts. ""People are used to thinking of GPS as location,"" Minson says, ""but it turns out that the change in position of your phone from [GPS] is very, very accurate."" What phones lose in quality, they can make up for in quantity So the researchers set out to see if it was possible to create the cell phone warning system. They  looked at two earthquakes: one real and one hypothetical. ""In an ideal world, we'd test it by looking at cellphone observations of earthquakes,"" says USGS researcher Sara Minson. ""Unfortunately, those data don't exist."" Instead, the team looked at early warning data from the 2011 Tohoku earthquake in Japan, which was detected by 462 GPS-based earthquake sensors in the surrounding area. Of course, those sensors were working with more sophisticated instruments than you'd find in a smartphone. So the researchers removed data until these sensors’ readings were as crude as those from smartphones’ GPS and accelerometers. The result was a noisier data set, but one that could still detect an earthquake just 77 seconds after the first tremors, using the right algorithms. That simulation still assumes those 462 phones are behaving like good earthquake detectors, lying flat on a surface in clear view of a GPS satellite. So the researchers simulated a Magnitude 7 earthquake on the Hayward Fault near San Francisco, similar to the quake that hit the region during the World Series in 1989. Researchers used population maps to project how many phones would be in range, and they compared that with how much data would be needed to sense the quake. If just under 4,700 phones — that is, 0.2 percent of the units in the Bay Area — were actively reporting data, the earthquake would be reported only five seconds after the initial tremor. ""We really want to prove this can be done with smartphones."" That's not necessarily good news, as researchers are quick to admit, since it’s still unclear how many phones would really participate. Even if an earthquake-sensing app became widely adopted, it's not obvious what percentage of phones would be actively reporting at a given time. Most phones only check GPS intermittently, usually when there’s a clear view of the sky, which helps conserve the battery while keeping the phone’s location roughly up to date. To work as an earthquake sensor, a phone would have to check GPS more frequently, which would drain the battery faster and could scare users off the app entirely. As a result, the percentage of actively reporting phones might easily be less than 0.2 percent of the total population. A bigger problem comes from how phones typically manage that data. When an Android or iOS app calls for the phone's location, the app gets a smoothed version of the GPS, which automatically combines GPS data with other inputs for a less jumpy estimate of where you are. USGS wants the raw data from the phone's GPS chip, but because of the way Android and iOS manage location data, there’s no clear way for an application to grab the raw data before it’s smoothed out. It might be possible with a jailbroken iPhone or a custom Android fork, but USGS is still muddling through the programming challenges involved. In the meantime, the easiest solution is simply bundling a new GPS chip alongside the phone. The team's next move is a pilot project in Chile, which will build an early warning system out of commercially available phones bundled with an external GPS chip. The country doesn’t have an early warning system, so a working system based on cell phones could serve a crucial purpose, even if it doesn’t work quite as well as the more expensive seismograph-based systems. Each phone will be entirely dedicated to earthquake sensing, so it won't face all of the challenges of an earthquake-sensing app, but the researchers hope it will help to solve a number of the intermediate challenges.

More than half of the children and adults treated with cannabidiol (CBD) experienced fewer seizures over the course of a 12-week trial. The medicinal benefits of marijuana are a topic of great debate in the United States at the moment, where a number of states have recently legalized its use. Anecdotal reports and small-scale studies have suggested that cannabis could help sufferers of treatment-resistant epilepsy by reducing the number of seizures they suffer. The debate arises from the lack of properly rigorous research exploring the hypothesis, and it won't be settled by today's findings, which have important limitations that prevent them from being conclusive. Still, they do offer some of the strongest support yet for the basic premise that cannabis extracts can help. You won't have to get high to get better CBD is a non-psychoactive compound derived from cannabis, meaning it can be administered to patients without getting them high. Nonetheless, side effects reported in the study included drowsiness for a fifth of the participants, as well as diarrhea, fatigue, and loss of appetite. So far, 213 patients between the ages of 2 and 42 have taken part, of whom 137 have completed the full 12-week course. Fifty-four percent of them have seen a reduction in epileptic seizures. Dr. Orrin Devinsky of the NYU Langone Comprehensive Epilepsy Center is the lead researcher for this study, which he will present to the American Academy of Neurology’s Annual Meeting later this month. He cautions that it's still only an early trial that could be subject to a placebo effect: knowing you're taking something that's supposed to make you better could be helping by simply fostering a more positive mindset. Devinsky plans to soon begin a randomized, placebo-controlled trial, where neither the doctors nor the patients know whether they're receiving CBD or a placebo. That should preclude any potential bias in the findings and help establish a scientific basis for the enthusiasm (or otherwise) for using marijuana as a healing agent. The study was supported by GW Pharmaceuticals, a UK company that provided the cannabidiol used for testing. Devinsky and GW presented similar findings at the end of last year, though the number of patients has now grown and progress is being made toward more rigorous trials. One of the main stumbling blocks, notes Devinsky, is that at least three US federal agencies have to provide clearance before a cannabis trial on human subjects can proceed: the Food and Drug Administration, the Drug Enforcement Agency, and the Bureau of Narcotic Enforcement.

Researchers said today that the Curiosity rover has detected salts on Mars capable of significantly lowering the freezing point of water. This would allow water, which is typically frozen on Mars, to take up a liquid state even in spite of the planet's frigid temperatures. The researchers' analysis leads them to believe that liquid water may exist in Mars' soil at night before evaporating again during the day. The results are being published today in the the journal Nature Geoscience.  ""These conditions exist at night and just after sunrise in the winter."" ""We have discovered the substance calcium perchlorate in the soil and, under the right conditions, it absorbs water vapor from the atmosphere,"" Morten Bo Madsen, a University of Copenhagen researcher and co-author of the paper, says in a statement. ""Our measurements from the Curiosity rover’s weather monitoring station show that these conditions exist at night and just after sunrise in the winter.""   The process would begin with water vapor in the air each night. After it condenses on Mars' surface, the salts — in the form of calcium perchlorate — then saturate the water, lowering its freezing point. The water should then be able to turn into a liquid and be absorbed by the soil. The researchers found these conditions in the Gale Crater, but they believe that the same conditions likely exist across Mars. Researchers have already determined that Mars once held large quantities of liquid water, but that was quite some time ago. Signs of liquid water existing on other planets today are always exciting because, on Earth, water is a requirement for life. But the researchers of this paper suggest that just because Mars may have water, it isn't necessarily hospitable.

These data breaches involved unencrypted information that could be identified and tied back to individuals. And what's worse is that the study indicates that these data breaches are on the rise. ""The personal health information of patients in the United States is not safe."" ""The personal health information of patients in the United States is not safe,"" write Commonwealth Fund physician David Blumenthal and health care lawyer Deven McGraw, in an editorial published alongside the study today. ""And it needs to be."" Overall, 58 percent of the data breaches occurred via theft. The other 42 percent had to do with loss or improper disposal of data, unauthorized access or disclosure of health information, and hacking or information technology incidents. In 67 percent of cases, data breaches involved health information stored electronically. And most of the time, these breaches were connected to laptop computers and portable electronic devices, like cell phones and tablets. But the frequency of these data breaches might actually be the most worrisome aspect of this study. In 2013, the frequency of breaches that occurred through hacking, unauthorized access, or unauthorized disclosure increased to 27 percent, from 12 percent just three years prior. And the frequency could increase further still, the researchers say. ""Given the rapid expansion in electronic health record deployment since 2012, as well as the expected increase in cloud-based services… the frequency and scope of electronic health care data breaches are likely to increase,"" the researchers write in the study. These security breaches could involve everything from health sensors and gene sequencing technology, to predictive analytics and personal health records. To get these numbers, the researchers sifted through a government database containing information about data breaches involving unencrypted health information reported by clinicians and health plans. They analyzed reports of data breaches involving 500 individuals or more — about 82 percent of reports, or 949 breaches total. All the health information was protected by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), an act designed to protect the confidentiality and security of health care information. Some individuals may have been hit more than once The fact that 29 million electronic health records were exposed through data breaches between 2010 and 2013 doesn’t mean that 29 million individual Americans suffered a data breach of this sort during those three years. It’s entirely possible that certain individuals were hit more than once, or that some of the health information was duplicated elsewhere. Still, it looks like millions of people in the US have been victims of an invasion of privacy. Moreover, because the researchers only analyzed data breaches involving 500 people or more, the ""29 million electronic health records"" they report is definitely an underestimation. Overall, the study paints a pretty depressing picture for those who think electronic records could reduce the cost of health care as whole, while improving its accuracy and speed. If these data breaches persist, Blumenthal and McGraw write, it's possible that people will start to resist the idea of sharing their health information via electronic means, which could reduce its value for individual care and its availability for research.

The new features, available as part of an in-app update, allow users to share details of their rides with up to five contacts, and to call the police using a new SOS button in case of an emergency. The new ""Send Status"" feature is an enhanced version of the ShareMyETA option that has been available for over a year. After ordering a car, users can choose to share details of their ride — including the driver's photo, license plate number, and live GPS tracking — with up to five pre-selected contacts. Those contacts can then track the ride in real-time from start to finish, and the customer won't face any SMS charges.   The SOS button, located in the top right of the screen, is designed to let users quickly contact local authorities in the case of an emergency. After tapping it, the rider will be prompted to confirm the call before placing it. Uber hinted at these changes late last year, after the company vowed to deploy a ""local team of specially-trained safety experts"" to strengthen background checks of its driver. It was later reported that the driver accused of raping the female passenger near Delhi also faced rape charges in 2011.   Last year's incident in Delhi sparked widespread controversy in India, where services like Uber are generally seen as a safer alternative for female passengers. According to recent government statistics, 585 women were raped in Delhi in 2012, more than any other Indian city. That's likely a lower bound, as well, since the figure doesn't include the rape and sexual assault cases that go unreported. Delhi officials responded by banning Uber from operating in the city, but the company last month resumed operations after applying for a taxi license — a distinction that has been central to ongoing protests against the service across the globe. The new features are currently available as an update for Android users, and an iOS version will be released soon.

That's backed up by reports earlier this week from Business Insider and The Mac Observer, both of which point toward Apple working on a car. That said, these conclusions appear to be based in part on the type of experts that Apple has been hiring and not actual intel on its plans.  Google and Uber want to make cars. Why not Apple? Stepping into the auto industry would be a difficult move for Apple, which at this point doesn't have the manufacturing capabilities to back that up. Alternatively, it's possible that Apple is working on vehicle-related projects, such as self-driving technology, street-mapping equipment, or control systems to extend CarPlay. At this point, it's likely that any product that comes from this lab is still years out. It's also worth remembering that Apple frequently researches new technologies and tests new products that it never releases publicly. Apple's automotive research lab is said to be run by managers who used to work on the iPhone, according to FT. Apple is also reported to have hired the head of Mercedes-Benz's Silicon Valley research unit. Apple designers are said to have been meeting with auto execs in recent months, though it's not clear if this is related to the new lab or its existing work on CarPlay. Business Insider also reports that Apple has been hiring away talent from Tesla.

The decision comes after a six-month review of the country's suitability for driverless tech, with the government confirming that current laws are no barrier to testing, and that £19 million ($29 million) in funding will be handed out to four pilot schemes across the country.  However, this doesn't mean that UK residents can expect to see empty hatchbacks roaming the streets anytime soon. In terms of actual utility the projects scheduled for trials later this year are more like localized shuttles than actual cars: they'll operate in limited numbers, mostly in pedestrianised areas, they won't be available for public use, and they'll always have a licensed driver behind the wheel. THESE AREN'T CARS — THEY'RE SHUTTLES The government plans to introduce a new ""code of practice"" to regulate the trials, a non-legislative approach that it says will be ""more flexible and less onerous ... than the regulatory approach being followed in other countries, notably in the US."" No doubt this refers to the fact that although America was the first country to introduce laws covering driverless cars the vehicles are only currently legal in four states. In Europe, only Germany and Sweden have carried out similar legal reviews. The UK government also announced that it does plan to introduce actual legislation in 2017 that would cover more complex issues — such as liability in the case of a crash. The Uk wants the law to be ""more flexible and less onerous"" than in America The schemes currently planned for the UK aren't likely to cause any pile-ups however — two of them use electrical vehicles that can't travel much faster than a run, while the third only includes a single vehicle. The two projects using electric cars are scheduled to begin testing later this year: that's the Lutz Pathfinder Pod in Milton Keynes and Coventry, and the Meridian shuttle in the southern London borough of Greenwich. The final project is run by Venturer and will be operating out of Bristol, but only consists of single, repurposed military jeep, and won't hit the streets until 2016. Of the more immediate projects, the Lutz is the more futuristic looking of the two, with angular wheel caps and a windscreen that arches over the top of the two-seater cab. The Meridian is bigger but looks more like a double-ended golf cart, with a sort of circular seating pit that fits ten and looks fit for shuttling tourists around at Disney World. Neither are particularly fast (the Lutz has a top speed of 15mph while the Meridian can't go faster than 12mph) and both will stick to primarily pedestrianized areas. It's a small step for now, but the UK government obviously has big plans to open up development as fast possible. Who knows what might grow out of these little pods?

There's no guarantee it'll make it to production That's not to say that there'll ever be an Apple car on the road, necessarily. WSJ hedges its report, noting that it'd be several years at least before Titan could be ready for production, and that's assuming Cook and company decide to go through with the project. It could also end up being more of a platform for testing other products and technologies related to mobility that Apple is working on — things like CarPlay, for instance. Apple has apparently had this in the hopper for a while: the report claims that Tim Cook signed off on Titan nearly a year ago, giving ex-Ford engineer and current Apple exec Steve Zadesky a team of 1,000 staff from across a variety of departments in the company. In recent months, company staff have visited contract manufacturers that could potentially build a car (or components of a car) on Apple's behalf; one company that WSJ names is Magna Steyr, which has built cars for Mercedes and BMW in the past, among others. It's not totally clear why Apple would be looking to make such an enormous leap from its core competency — building great consumer electronics — but there might be a simple explanation: the company's explosive growth will eventually peter out unless it expands to new markets, and there's no question that transportation would fall into that category.",0.46620057441537877,0.5337994255846212,0.5465554665468332,291,4.8178694158075599,192,5.6875,0,0,"Apple, Tech, Transportation"

Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic just completed a deal to build a facility for the design and manufacturing of LauncherOne, a two-stage orbital launch vehicle that can carry satellites weighing up to 500 pounds. The 150,000-square-foot facility will be built at the Long Beach Airport in a spot formerly occupied by Boeing. There is at least one mission already on the books for LauncherOne. A company called OneWeb is trying to create a satellite-based internet by launching a network of 648 of them into orbit. Branson announced a deal with the company last month. Instead of using launchpads like SpaceX, LauncherOne is designed to be released mid-flight from Virgin's WhiteKnightTwo aircraft. (Orbital's Pegasus I rocket works in a similar way but is designed to carry heavier satellites, and the company's working on a ""Pegasus II"" project that echoes Virgin's current setup.) Virgin Galactic claims this method allows it offer a launch price that is the ""lowest in the nation or perhaps the world."" Launches every three or four hours, instead of twice a month This method could also make it easier for companies to place their satellites in the desired orbit since the launch doesn't have to take place from a fixed position. Branson told CNBC last month that the LauncherOne and WhiteKnightTwo combination could allow the company to ""literally take off every three or four hours.""

That inevitably sets the imagination running wild: how can a company that makes most of its money from a pocket-sized chunk of aluminum and circuitry make the transition into transportation — a brutal industry that has claimed hundreds of companies over the last century? At a high level, I'd suggest that reinventing the automobile today is no more audacious than reinventing the cellphone in 2007, as Apple did — and it might even be easier, considering Apple's historic brand power and market position. But that doesn't mean it'd be a walk in the park, nor does it mean that it's the only thing Apple could be working on. Let's have a look at a few projects that Tim Cook, Jony Ive, and team could be cooking at their rumored transportation research lab.  CarPlay, like Android Auto, has a fairly substantial flaw: it's limited in scope. It doesn't control car functions, per se — climate control, AM / FM radio, settings for your daytime running lamps, so on. That means that any time you need to do something outside the scope of CarPlay, you need to exit out of it and deal with a different user experience controlled by the automaker. Nine times out of 10, that experience won't be as good. Apple could offer to work hand-in-hand with a car company to do something far grander in scale. Imagine Apple's software and hardware design sensibilities scaled up for a complete takeover of a car's cabin: the instrument cluster, the seat heaters, and everything in between. Alternatively, Apple could be going head-to-head with suppliers like BlackBerry's QNX division, which basically offers turnkey operating systems for the dashboard. If you're Ford, GM, Volkswagen, Toyota, or another major automaker and Apple approached you about a partnership of that magnitude, you'd have to at least consider it, right? (Notably, Apple was said to have worked with Jaguar on the controls of the XF sedan several years ago.)     The lack of street view has been an enormous blind spot for Apple Maps since it launched several years ago. The company has filled the gap with its stunning three-dimensional overhead view — courtesy of mapping firm C3 Technologies, which it acquired in 2011 — but it's no substitute for Google Maps, which lets you get an eye-level view of a neighborhood so you can actually see what you're looking for when you're navigating to a destination. The vans belonging to Apple that have been spotted with racks full of cameras mounted on their roofs could certainly suggest that they're testing their own street view solution — but those same racks could just as easily be used in a computer vision system for self-driving technology. Taking pictures of street corners and autonomous driving are, needless to say, two very different things. I get the sense that demand for CarPlay and Android Auto — especially once drivers start using it — will be extremely high. Soon, you won't want to buy a car without it. Apple could be getting that same impression, so it's scaling its research into driver-car interfaces way, way up. As it stands, CarPlay is little more than a tweaked iPhone / iPad user interface with a bunch of capabilities locked out to reduce driver distraction; imagine how much smarter it could get over the next few years.   I'm immediately reminded of Gogoro, the recently introduced scooter and battery swapping system whose CEO is a longtime designer — one who takes his work very seriously. And when you look at the rise of ""rideables"" — electric skateboards, bicycles, so on — there's lots of hunger for innovation in personal mobility lately. Sure, the Segway was a complete disaster, but that was a long time ago. Urbanization is on the rise; so is global warming. A one- or two-place Apple transporter could be a huge deal. This is the improbable conclusion that's being bandied about more than any other right now. The rumors and reporting from FT and Business Insider suggest that Apple is indeed hiring the kinds of people that it would take to make a car — a real, road-going car to compete with the world's auto giants. Five years ago, I would've laughed it off. I still think it's an outside chance — there are dozens of lower-hanging fruits where Apple could spend its billions blowing up entire industries, and easier ways to have a dramatic impact on mobility — but it's now impossible to write off completely. Tesla is the test case here: a startup is now the hottest name in electric cars, and perhaps the hottest name in the automotive world, period. It's not profitable (in fact, it just had a pretty disastrous quarter), but there's enough momentum behind Musk's various initiatives that his company is very unlikely to go away. And let's not forget that the Model S isn't just passable — it's a legitimately fantastic (and terrifyingly fast) car. A decade ago, Tesla had no more experience building world-class cars than Apple does today. Oh, and Apple is starting with $180 billion in the bank. (That's just slightly less than the market capitalizations of GM, Ford, and Volkswagen combined.)",0.6121722637102416,0.3878277362897584,0.17753405022146532,893,4.8577827547592385,504,6.0694444444444446,0,4,"Apple, Tech, Transportation, Report"

Biomimicry draws inspiration from the ocean, with reptilian-like scaly skin and embedded lights to channel the ""bioluminescent qualities"" of deep sea fish. Technology focuses on function, incorporating collapsing pleats for increased mobility and abrasion resistant panels on the torso. Trends in Society is based off of everyday apparel, looking like a cloth cover for the internal suit that has electroluminescent wire and patches across the body. NASA has set up a website with the three designs and the public can vote until April 15. But unfortunately the crowd favorite won't even make it into space: according to NASA, it'll be used on Earth for things like ground-based training and vacuum chamber tests. For now, we'll just have to keep dreaming for stylish space travel.",0.561843748371485,0.438156251628515,0.8692399568065308,225,5.0711111111111107,159,5.949685534591195,0,0,"Design, Science"

According to the project's technology video, the entire piece is basically ""a distributed website on the sculpture,"" or a bunch of web browsers working together to manipulate light, sound, and movement. The physical net is made from a material similar to fishing line that's 15 times stronger than steel, and five projectors map a screen and lights onto the sculpture from below. Spectators connect to the project's Wi-Fi and a browser will open on their smartphones that lets them draw art that will appear on the sculpture. They can control colored lights to move them around the ropes, and ambient sounds will come out of each smartphone's speakers, creating a visual and audible show.

Today at CES it showed off its newest concept for enhancing your car's smarts, the very industrial sounding RNB6, which will no doubt be replaced when its ready to go on sale. This is unit meant to upgrade a dumb car into a smart one, a fresh take on the Asteroid Parrot has been selling for years. The company says the new system is compatible with 90 percent of the cars on the road today, anything that can fit a double DIN sized CD player. but the big selling point they pushed was that it makes it effortless to switch back and forth between the competing operating systems coming to market: Google's Android Auto and Apple's Carplay. Just connect your phone, push a button, and all your apps are pushed to the dashboard, where you can interact with them using voice controls and generally stay a little safer on the road. Parrot also has its own services available on the device, and some of what we saw was pretty cool. The interface is definitely faster, smoother, and more intuitive than many modern smartcar dashboards we played with. The RNB6 comes with a dashcam that can provide time lapse video, lane assist, and braking alerts based on the video feed from your dash cam. If your car has a rear facing camera the Parrot system offers parking assist based on that video feed. Another nice feature of the unit is that is interacts with the OBD port in your car. It works like systems from Dash or Automatic. You can then see a detailed readout on your recent gas mileage and driving habits. If you get a check engine light, the system will be able to tell you what's wrong, so you can scope out how much the repair should cost before you get to the mechanic. h2.ces-promo a{  background: #fa4b2a;  border-radius: 3px;  padding: 5px 14px 0px;  font-family: ff-din-web-condensed,Helvetica,sans-serif;  text-transform: uppercase;  font-weight: normal;  font-size: 30px;  text-align:center;  display:inline-block;  margin:0px auto;  color: #fff;}  h2.ces-promo a:hover {      background:#bf2a0d;      color:#fff;      text-decoration:none;    }}",0.8770201430687978,0.12297985693120217,0.20010981973596478,435,4.5862068965517242,269,5.8178438661710041,0,0,"Business, CES 2015, Tech, Hands-on"

Shatner also noted that blocking the offending accounts would remove them from a user's ""following"" list, and indeed it seems that Shatner has cleaned up his list accordingly, as have the other people who've seen this happen.

The case is being brought by three death row inmates who are arguing for the discontinued use of midazolam, the first drug in Oklahoma's three-drug execution cocktail. The motion was initially filed by four inmates, but one, Charles Warner, was executed in January despite requesting a stay. Oklahoma currently uses midazolam as a sedative, despite its questionable effectiveness as one. A petition filed by the inmates at the start of this year argued that midazolam ""cannot maintain a deep, coma-like unconsciousness"" necessary to prevent the prisoner from feeling excessive pain. Last year, after a botched execution that lasted an agonizing 43 minutes, Oklahoma temporarily halted all executions in the state. Oklahoma just approved the use of nitrogen gas Just last week, Oklahoma Governor Mary Fallin signed into law a bill that approved the use of nitrogen gas for executions in the state. The method, which will go into effect this November, is meant to be a backup to lethal injections, presumably in preparation for the court's decision this week. Even if the justices decide Oklahoma's lethal injection process is unconstitutional, the state can now move to nitrogen gas, followed by electrocution and finally, firing squad. In 2008, the Supreme Court ruled in Kentucky's Baze v. Rees that a three-drug execution was constitutional. Those three drugs were sodium thiopental (an anesthetic), pancuronium bromide (a paralytic) and potassium chloride, which ultimately stops the heart. But midazolam is a benzodiazepine that has no pain-relieving properties. Florida is the only other state to use midazolam as the first drug in its three-drug cocktail. Ohio and Arizona have both used it in a two-drug cocktail. The Supreme Court hasn't stepped in to examine the lethal injection procedure since 2008.

Comcast and Time Warner Cable, the two largest cable and broadband  companies in the US, announced the merger last February. Despite their  size, Comcast argued that the two served different enough markets that  customers would not notice a drop in competition. It also agreed to spin  off some Time Warner Cable subscribers, keeping its ownership of the US  cable TV market under 30 percent. Nonetheless, the resulting company  was likely to control a significant portion of the US broadband market.  The proposal was rumored to have died earlier this week after the companies met with the FCC and Justice Department, both of  whom expressed concerns about the power of a combined Comcast  and Time Warner Cable. On Wednesday, the FCC apparently suggested a  ""hearing designation order"" that could delay or kill the deal, and  Comcast's stake in Hulu (acquired through its merger with NBC Universal in 2011) reportedly concerned the Justice Department. ""The proposed merger would have posed an unacceptable risk to competition and innovation."" FCC chair Tom Wheeler has since issued a statement about the decision: ""Comcast and Time Warner Cable's decision to end Comcast's proposed acquisition of Time Warner Cable is in the best interests of consumers. The proposed transaction would have created a company with the most broadband and the video subscribers in the nation alongside the ownership of significant programming interests. Today, an online video market is emerging that offers new business models and greater consumer choice.

That review was inspired by the unsettling news that has come out in the wake of the Snowden leaks, including the news that the US had been monitoring German Chancellor Angela Merkel's cell phone. In response to the news, the parliament is now looking to narrow the selector terms allowed by the NSA, a meager but tangible pushback that would mean information sharing is no longer the blank check it once was. The selector terms also show real overreach on the NSA's part.

This will be the first traditional numbered Dragon Quest game to hit a home console in some time. Dragon Quest VIII for the PlayStation 2 was a massive hit in 2004, but follow-up IX surprised many when it was announced as a Nintendo DS release, and X is an MMO for the Wii, Wii U, and 3DS. The series has a long history with both Nintendo and Sony, bouncing between the two as their popularity rises and falls, so for this release Square Enix will get to have it both ways.

The motion-tracking work is impressive: look for all the detail work done to change the Tannen museum into a Trump museum. The similarities between Biff Tannen and Donald Trump are well documented, but for those new to the national conversation, Marty McFly's nemesis Biff Tannen makes his fortune in the 1980s off a casino, a hotel, and real estate — along with a sports almanac from the future.

That's a major milestone for any American pop culture icon, putting him on a plane right beside the likes of Superman in terms of sheer longevity. As a cartoon character, he's a legend; many of us, along with our parents, grew up with him. He even has his own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. But if anyone asked you who the single greatest cartoon character ever created was, you might waffle. It's really not that hard. Bugs is GOAT. Let's start with the cartoons themselves. If you want a semi-formal study on why Bugs and his Looney Tunes brethren are so great, you should probably start with Chuck Jones. Jones was one of the most important animators of the last century (he won three Oscars for his work, not that that really matters) and understanding him is to better understand what made Bugs so irresistible:  Jones gave us the classic ""Hunting Season Trilogy"" along with what What's Opera, Doc?, which is widely considered one of the finest cartoons ever made. But he was just one artist who touched on Bugs as a character. Others like Friz Freleng and Bob McKimson also directed classics like Knighty Knight Bugs and Devil May Hare, respectively, that expanded on Bugs' character. Each one built on the myth. Bugs, minding his own business, would run into some adversary who wanted his hide. Faced with a challenge, Bugs would inevitably triumph with wit and grace.  And the myth is everything. As a character, Bugs Bunny is king, and he's as close to an animated culture hero as we're going to get. Think about it. He's the person you want to be — the smartest one in the room who's still effortlessly cool. He's quick-witted, funny, and even a little cruel, but only to his tormenters. He could hang with Wagner and Rossini, but you never forgot he was from Brooklyn. And he's the guy you want in your corner when the bullies come calling, because he didn't need brawn to win. In effect, Bugs embodies a kind of American icon that's simultaneously exceptional but still the underdog. You can't help but root for him even if you know he's going to win. Bugs is an American icon, at once exceptional but ever the underdog  And he can even do it in a dress. Bugs' love of drag lends credence to the idea that he is possibly one of the most progressive cartoon characters ever created. Dresses don't make him weak. He's somehow even more powerful when dressed as Scarlett O'Hara, and manages to break down our assumptions about the gender binary because he never needs to pass. To borrow from Hedwig and the Angry Inch, put a wig on his head, and suddenly he's Miss Midwest. And it always works flawlessly.  Other characters certainly come close to this kind of power. Homer Simpson is the quintessential everyman, and is able to bend the world around him with sheer joy and stupidity. Meanwhile, The Simpsons is one of the most influential cartoons ever made. Still, you probably wouldn't want to be him. Mickey Mouse is perhaps an even bigger icon since he represents one of the biggest companies in the world. Nevertheless, his identity has faded into his logo. What is Mickey Mouse even about if not a massive corporation bent on swallowing civilization? Homer Simpson and Mickey Mouse fall short of Bugs' greatness Bug Bunny is those things and more. He's a company mascot, but you know his voice. He's what Americans are but also what they wish they could be. He's truly aspirational. Is there any wonder why he could take on Jordan in his prime?

""Ecce Homo"" streaming from open car windows, ""Titus Andronicus"" blaring from arena monitors at the pivotal moments of sports games, breathless coverage of every new tweet from the band's account: it makes for a fun thought, albeit one that’s going to remain a fantasy. It’s not controversial to state that rock is a genre pinned to the margins of today’s musical climate. Hip-hop and electronic music have more commercial potency and more social and cultural relevance; they’re younger and more volatile. Rock isn’t dead, but it’s increasingly a niche concern. Bands like Mumford & Sons and songs like ""Take Me to Church,"" managing to grab casual ears through mercenary songcraft and bombast, are exceptions rather than the rule; strong albums from the likes of Sleater-Kinney and Courtney Barnett, taut and tuneful and rich in personality, strike the charts with glancing blows before slinking off to decent positions on year-end lists. For a band like Titus Andronicus — one that’s closer to Infinite Jest than 50 Shades of Grey — this means their prominence is destined to lag behind their intensity, their ambition, and their effort. This is a five-act rock opera about manic depression and self-improvement The Most Lamentable Tragedy, their daring and relentless fourth studio album, isn’t going to change their fate. It’s the longest entry in their discography by a wide margin, and it’s the most narratively complex. This is a five-act rock opera about manic depression and working towards self-improvement with the help of an alternate self, and it's stuffed with references to the band’s earlier work, their predecessors, and the world around them. (If you want to know more — like, a lot more — I recommend perusing frontman Patrick Stickles’ insanely detailed annotations on the album’s lyrics over at Genius.) The album’s running time and intricacy aren’t much of a surprise: this is a band named after a Shakespearean tragedy that broke out with an hour-plus concept record about the Civil War, a band that’s stretched a song series called ""No Future"" out over three albums and seven years. They’re no strangers to complication. All of this makes for an imposing listen, even for people who are ostensibly paid to take imposing listens and render them less so. Hitting play on TMLT is a little like sitting down to watch The Wire for the first time, or eyeing that paperback copy of Anna Karenina tucked into your bookshelf. You know you’re going to enjoy yourself, but you have to jump a few mental hurdles before making that commitment. I cannot emphasize this enough: make the commitment. If you never feel the need to revisit the album’s narrative components, short interstitial tracks, pseudo Celtic dirges, and gorgeous hymns for Egyptian sun gods after your first pass, feel free to do so. Even then, you’ll still be left with some of the best music this band has ever made: colorful, concise flamethrowers, dreamy pieces of ambient punk, songs that sound like Bruce Springsteen distilled until the result could burn a hole in your floor. (That’s how it works, of course: their greatest displays of brevity, tucked within their most sprawling and unwieldy document.) Until TMLT, I’d never associated listening to Titus Andronicus with anything like fun. Admiration and respect, sure, or maybe the feeling you get when you finish something that’s difficult but necessary; fun, definitely not. It’s everywhere you turn on TMLT. The first Titus Andronicus song one could describe as ""romantic"" The album’s finest moments seem to come in pairs, twin blasts scattered throughout its almost 30 tracks. The bluesy, swaggering ""Lonely Boy"" prefaces the tight harmonies of the Daniel Johnston quasi-cover ""I Lost My Mind."" A drunken, uproarious romp through The Pogues’ ""A Pair of Brown Eyes"" is married to the sweet, pining ""Come On, Siobhán,"" which is both the first Titus Andronicus song one could describe as ""romantic"" and the first one that sounds like both Thin Lizzy and The Verve. (Making Stickles’ stubbly yawp the center of a lovesick, string-flecked piece of radio rock might be this album’s greatest achievement.) Topping them all is the central twosome of ""Fired Up"" and ""Dimed Out,"" twin joyrides through the New Jersey wetlands in a roadster without working brakes. This is vital music in the truest sense of the word: you can’t help but feel like Stickles needs to make it to live. It’s still hard to imagine a Titus Andronicus song slotting into Beats 1 alongside ""Cha Cha"" and Drake’s radio show, and I’m probably not going to hear it from any cars on the street below me this summer. But this is big music, and if you submit to The Most Lamentable Tragedy, you’ll come out the other side changed: wowed by the sheer scale of it, exhausted by its breadth, maybe even inspired by its reach. In a strong year for music like it, it’s carved out a spot near the top of its field, no small feat. And though the title of ""biggest band in the world"" is an anachronism at this point — a title linking The Beatles and Led Zeppelin and U2 and Nirvana and… Coldplay? — TMLT captures a band worthy of holding the belt, even if only in your dreams.",0.7001461559622395,0.2998538440377605,0.18114724084635028,928,4.9838362068965516,537,6.0093109869646186,0,0,"Culture, Entertainment, Music, Music Review"

Here's something you might not know about Roker: he's a contemporary Renaissance man, a media personality who also happens to be an author, a cooking enthusiast, and the head of a TV production company. And through Roker Labs, the new innovation-centric arm of Al Roker Entertainment, he's trying to add a new title to his crowded résumé: live streaming pioneer. Roker's company is bringing three new pieces of original content to live streaming app Meerkat this week, all of which are about food. The first episode, which ran this afternoon at 1:00PM ET, featured Roker interviewing executives from food delivery startup Plated in the company's New York test kitchen. Future episodes are scheduled to air tomorrow afternoon at 4:00PM ET and Wednesday afternoon at 1:00PM ET. Roker was an early Meerkat adopter, broadcasting live from New York as the app gained steam in Austin during this year's SXSW festivities. He's also a published cookbook author, with his byline on collections like Al Roker's Hassle-Free Holiday Cookbook. That's all fine, but this still makes for a strange pairing: a television mainstay, partnering with an app that exploded into the public consciousness only to crater a few weeks later. To Roker's credit, he seems to be approaching this with the right level of enthusiasm. ""You don’t know where it’s going to go, but I think it’s going to be fun to be the first out there.

In an announcement today, CEO John Legere announced he was adding Apple Music to the carrier's free music-streaming program, joining Spotify, Google Play Music, Soundcloud, Tidal, and dozens of other services. Apple Music support will replace iTunes Radio, which had previously been supported. As a result, T-Mobile users will be able to stream endless quantities from Apple Music without counting against their data caps. In the weeks since the service launched, Legere says Apple Music has accounted for 80 percent of the requests made to Music Freedom. The move is also likely to infuriate net neutrality advocates, who have objected to the Music Freedom program from the beginning as a prime example of zero-rating. While customers get to dodge charges, Music Freedom necessarily means discriminating against services that aren't part of the deal. The service puts video services like Vevo or even smaller music services like Pono at a huge disadvantage, since users will face now-unnecessary data charges any time they venture outside of a Music Freedom-approved service. Still, those lingering concerns don't seem to have stopped companies from signing on to Music Freedom, or customers from taking advantage of it. According to Legere, the services on Music Freedom now represent 95 percent of the music streamed in the United States, streaming 131 million songs per day and incurring what could otherwise be billions of dollars in data charges on a capped plan. 7/28 12:03PM ET: Updated to clarify that Apple Music participlation replaces iTunes Radio rather than supplementing it.",0.34911433209811504,0.650885667901885,0.8045268654046676,260,5.384615384615385,179,6.0558659217877091,0,0,"Culture, Entertainment, Mobile, Tech"

I blame a combination of factors, really. For one, the platforming game, which launches today on the PlayStation 4, is absolutely huge; I’ve made my way through hundreds of levels so far, but thousands remain,  including the player-created stages that will begin popping up once the game is out. N++ is also like its predecessors N and N+: incredibly, impossibly hard. Jumps — the heart of the game — require machine-like precision, and you’ll be dealing with homing missiles, targeted laser beams, and all kinds of other deadly obstacles as you glide through the air. Sometimes I just sit and stare at a level, wondering how the hell I’m even supposed to start. The thing is, even though I’m sure I won’t ever finish the game, I’m just as sure that I won’t stop trying anytime soon. N++’s unusual name is a part of its legacy. It’s an evolution of sorts: Toronto-based studio Metanet Software first released the browser game N in 2004, and followed it up with an improved version for the Xbox 360, called N+. N++ builds on the original premise even further. At its core the game is exceedingly simple; you play as a nimble ninja, jumping through a futuristic, minimalist world. Each level takes place on a single screen, and contains both a switch and a locked door (there are also optional gold pieces to collect). To escape you’ll need to flip the switch then reach the unlocked exit door.  Platformers might be the most oversaturated genre in video games, but there’s still nothing that feels quite like an N game — even now, more than a decade after the series debuted. It all comes down to the sense of movement. The tiny ninja — who has been streamlined to be even more stick-like this time around — moves deliberately. She floats through the air slowly, as if the gravity has been turned down a few notches, and you can alter her movement mid-air or while she slides down a wall. It takes some getting used to, but once you get the hang of it there’s no going back. N++’s deliberate pace and controls gives you much more control over your character than in comparable games. And you’ll definitely need it. It can be incredibly hard to outrun your past There’s a sound you’ll hear a lot in the game: a bloody splat. You’ll hear it when you get zapped by a laser, or when you hit a wall of spikes, or when a huge fall proves too much for your little ninja to handle. The level design of N++ seems to delight in masochism, and the bloody splat is the sound of the game mocking you. Levels are bundled together in groups of five, called episodes, and while each episode starts out relatively easy, they tend to ramp up the challenge considerably. I’ve spent hours trying to complete single jumps, ones that require absolute precision and timing to get around the insane number of obstacles plotted in your way. One of the new additions to N++, for example, is the evil ninja, and I absolutely hate them. When you hit a switch, it will spawn a clone who will replicate everything you do. If you touch it, you die, and just like in life it can be incredibly hard to outrun your past. In one stage — a narrow tunnel with four ledges to jump on — I had to contend with a total of five ninjas chasing me, while also navigating a maze of explosive mines. Over the hour or so it took me to finish it I heard a lot of splats. When I finally completed the level it felt like I had just pulled off an elaborate heist; my heart was racing, and I was breathing heavily. I had to take a break to calm down before I started up the next episode. And that’s the thing about this game: even as you swear at it, cursing its murderous difficulty, you’re having fun. I learned to love the splat. I learned to love the splat The precise controls and brutally difficult level design were true of the previous games, but N++ feels more refined. There are new enemies and obstacles, but they all fit into the game seamlessly, without making the progression feel bloated or overly complex (the same goes for the co-operative and competitive multiplayer modes, which can get incredibly heated). And even though there are thousands of levels, each one — even the rare ones that will take you just a few seconds to finish — feel crafted with love. They work both aesthetically and from a gameplay perspective; a snapshot of a level often looks like page from a book on graphic design. As you make your way through the game you’ll unlock different color schemes — which you can switch between at any point — and they breathe new life into the game. Sometimes when I’m stuck I switch up the colors in the hopes that my brain will see the level in a new way. Sometimes it actually works.  And despite being so plentiful, the levels are incredibly varied; some stages will test your patience, forcing you to slowly make your way through a winding maze, while others will test your endurance, as you make a series of challenging, precise jumps without being able to take a breath in between. Still others will try to overwhelm you with the sheer number of enemies thrown your way. Each episode feels like it gives you something different, and the game is structured in a way that minimizes frustration. Even if you find yourself stuck on a level, you can just leave it and come back later. There are always plenty of episodes to take on at any given time. N++ is the result of a long, gruelling quest to create the ultimate version of N, and it feels like a game that was made with heart and passion. When I wasn’t dying, I was marvelling over the meticulous attention to detail; everything in the game just feels right, from the amazing, six-hour-long soundtrack to the smooth animations. I love watching the swirling trail of a homing missile on its way to kill me. It’s a game where death is just a tool that pushes you to try harder, to take a different path. I almost wish N++ would tell you how many times you died, because over the course of playing my ninja has come to her demise at least a thousand times. And here I am excited about the thousand yet to come. N++ is available today on the PS4.

Launched in 2011, the iOS (and later Android) app was a food-focused complement to Evernote's main note-clipping service. It was billed as a combination of scrapbook, cookbook, and Instagram feed, with some bells and whistles that ranged from redundant to forgettable. But beneath that, it gave structure to the one thing I'd actually done with Evernote up until that point: clip recipes from websites and save them to cook later. Evernote Food probably wasn't the single best recipe management tool, but unlike other dedicated cooking apps, it was built on the agnostic and flexible Evernote base service, and it let you search a selection of surprisingly good recipe blogs straight from the app. I'd guess over half the meals I've cooked in the past year were originally found through Evernote Food.

Even after Instagram began letting you shoot in landscape mode, you could still only share your work as a square. That all changes today: Instagram is updating its Android and iOS apps to enable native support for full-size landscape and portrait photos and video inside the app. They'll run alongside the traditional square photos, which will remain the default for photos shared on Instagram. When you access your photo gallery from within the updated app, you’ll now see a format button above the camera roll. You can use this button to toggle between square and full-size images. From there, you can zoom in and out to choose the best crop for your photos. Instagram used square photos to distinguish itself Initially, Instagram adopted square photos as a way of distinguishing itself from other photo-sharing apps. But they were also a practical choice. They helped provide a more consistent look as you scrolled down the feed, and they also looked better on smaller phone screens.   But as screen sizes have increased, and the platform has evolved to host more serious photography, the restrictive format has left many of the app’s 300 million monthly users frustrated. According to Instagram’s own research, 20 percent of uploaded photos have been modified to fit into the square frame, often using a third-party app that adds a ""letterbox"" effect to enable the sharing of landscape pictures. ""For the average person, one in every five stories in their feed looks like it's natively supported in our app,"" says Ashley Yuki, an Instagram product manager. ""Which is not great."" Even as third-party apps like Square Sized and Squaready have gained popularity, they leave dead space on the edges of photos, making them smaller and harder to see. It can also be annoying and time-consuming to have to use a separate app to prep your photos beforehand.

Mountain gorillas are among the world’s most endangered animals. But while they’ve captured both the public eye and the attention of primatologists, Dr. Chris Tyler-Smith of the Welcome Trust Sanger Institute says we’re just now figuring out how their unique position has shaped their genes. Tyler-Smith and a large team of other researchers have just published the results of a genome sequencing study, which sheds light on how gorillas developed, how to improve conservation, and how inbreeding works in some of humankind’s closest relatives. On a broad scale, humans are genetic outliers among the great apes — we’re a single species that lives in huge numbers all over the world. But mountain gorillas are at the very opposite end of the spectrum. This subspecies of gorilla was once reduced to a few hundred members, and even now, only about 800 are estimated to exist. In the 1980s, Dian Fossey’s book Gorillas in the Mist (and the Sigourney Weaver film adaptation) helped draw attention to their rapidly dwindling numbers, and conservation efforts pulled them back from the brink of extinction. Mountain gorilla populations have probably been small for thousands of years For a study published in Science today, the team sequenced the genomes of seven mountain gorillas and six eastern lowland gorillas — two divisions of the same eastern gorilla species. They compared them against genomes from the far more numerous western gorilla species. Unsurprisingly, there was less genetic diversity and more inbreeding. Less predictably, though, this wasn’t because humans had pushed them towards extinction. ""I had thought beforehand that it was probably modern human influence in the last centuries that had really decimated the mountain gorillas,"" says Tyler-Smith. ""But we see from the genetics that they've been very small in number for much longer than that."" Specifically, the team believes mountain gorilla populations have been in the hundreds for ""many thousands of years."" By comparing the mother and father’s contributions to a gorilla’s genome, they could roughly predict a common ancestor for specific sequences, then use that to estimate the population size over time. They could also look for genetic similarities with other gorilla communities, which would indicate cross-breeding. The genomes actually suggest that western and eastern gorillas completely separated 20,000 years ago, after drifting apart for 150,000 years. It’s possible to take these results and speculate about what finally drove them into separate species — the researchers point to the last Ice Age, which radically changed their environment. Eastern gorillas’ tiny numbers also produced some unusual results — in short, a lot of inbreeding. In a western lowland gorilla, around 14 percent of the genome length will be homozygous, meaning that the mother and father passed down identical genes. In mountain and eastern lowland gorillas, though, the number is closer to 35 percent. ""That is the most extreme inbreeding reported in any of the great apes,"" says Tyler-Smith, ""far more extreme than in any human population. So that very large amount of inbreeding was a surprise."" Inbreeding can increase the chance of getting rare genetic diseases, since it’s more likely that both parents will have a copy of a harmful gene. In the case of the mountain gorillas, though, the population was so small that the process appeared to purge the most harmful variations altogether. Geneticists have predicted this effect, Tyler-Smith says, but until now, it’s never been found in great apes. ""You can't just go up to a gorilla and take a blood sample from it."" Genome sequencing is a well-tested technology, but this study could suffer from the fact that a fairly small number of gorillas were involved. Mountain gorillas live in two separate groups, and all seven were from one place, says Tyler-Smith. ""So we'd definitely like to sequence some mountain gorillas from the other area where they live to compare them."" One major barrier is that it’s not exactly easy to recruit participants. For samples, the team relied on Gorilla Doctors, a veterinary program inspired by Fossey’s fight against the poaching, diseases, and injuries that were killing gorillas. ""You can't just go up to a gorilla and take a blood sample from it,"" says Tyler-Smith. ""You can only do that if a gorilla is anesthetized, and you don't anesthetize a gorilla just for research or for interest. You only do that when the gorilla's life is in danger."" Ultimately, Tyler-Smith says there are firm practical reasons to sequence as many gorillas as possible. ""We have the technology to do it, it's not that expensive, and that will give us the best genetic basis for understanding their populations,"" he says. ""It's only a small part of conservation, but it's still a useful part."" Populations are distinct enough that it might be possible, for example, to trace a captured gorilla’s lineage and return it to the right place, or to figure out where a poacher killed one and bring charges. Or genome sequences could be used by zoos for optimal breeding. This study doesn’t change the fact that mountain gorillas’ survival is still precarious. But Tyler-Smith thinks that what the team has learned about their genetics should make conservationists hopeful. ""The [population] size has been small for thousands of years,"" he says. ""So there's no reason it shouldn't continue this way for thousands more.""",0.6257120919627223,0.37428790803727774,0.5638337753435128,890,5.2550561797752806,456,6.2785087719298245,0,0,"Science, Report"

She stands a leggy 5 feet tall, weighs a trim 11 pounds, and sports a set of wings like you’ve never seen. Walnut the white-naped crane is the most genetically distinct endangered crane on the block — which means she needs to have been making babies, like, yesterday.  Walnut was raised by humans at a zoo, and as a result, she recognizes and trusts humans — and is deeply hostile to other cranes. How hostile? She killed the two male cranes that her former keepers attempted to pair with her. ""I like to jokingly tell people that Walnut ‘allegedly’ killed two male cranes,"" Crowe says. ""It’s not like she was tried and convicted. We don’t know her side of the story.""   Following the incidents, Walnut was transferred to the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute in Front Royal, Virginia, where she met Chris. Her new keepers were eager to see her mate with somebody. Anybody. So when she lifted her wings in a mating dance and let fly the sensual woo-wooooo that can only mean one thing, her keepers were inclined to give her what she wanted. Namely, Chris. And because cranes can live up to 60 years in captivity, Chris isn’t getting out of this anytime soon. Walnut could have chosen worse: her guy has always had a soft spot for animals, particularly endangered species. In the past, his conservation work sent him into the field, where he worked with California condors, red wolves, and black-footed ferrets. Now, he cares for 24 cranes. ""I like getting to know these animals individually and giving them the best captive life they can have,"" he says. Chris and Walnut’s pairing is an odd one: her species has every reason to mistrust ours. Our agriculture, dams, and pollution have ravaged the wetlands where cranes breed and feed. Walnut is part of what is called a security population, maintained to keep the species going if ever the wild population were to suddenly disappear. ""She is an excellent ambassador for her species,"" Crowe says. ""People always remember her story, and if they remember her, hopefully they’ll also remember that habitat loss is driving cranes to extinction."" With only 5,000 members left in her species worldwide, Walnut’s celibacy represents a shirking of civic duty. A crane who has not yet mated can contribute new traits to the species’ gene pool, so Walnut is a primo listing in the Studbook, a directory used by zoos to find mates for members of endangered species. ""It’s basically eHarmony for cranes,"" says Crowe. Because Walnut has imprinted on humans, however, she is simply never going to get with a crane — that’s how two male cranes ended up dead, after all.   Chris, on the other hand, she seemed to like. ""Pairing in the wild consists of elaborate courtship displays and vocalizations that can only progress to actual pairing if there is mutual interest,"" says Crowe. ""If birds are uninterested, they communicate it through visual and vocal threats or fly away."" Chris did not fly away. Each day he greeted her warmly, called her a pretty girl, asked about her day, brought her mice. He joined her in picking up objects and tossing them synchronously into the air. When Walnut said dance, he danced. When she said bob your head, he asked how hard. When she made her unison call, ululating into the wind, he echoed. ""I sounded like Homer Simpson. You know….woo hoo!"" Crowe says. ""I actually make a lousy crane, but she likes me anyway."" Eventually it was time to get down to business: artificial insemination. Normally, cranes must be restrained for artificial insemination, which can stress an animal enough to hurt the chances of pregnancy. But if birds have a mate, the companionship makes them calmer, more resilient to stress — and they also avoid artificial insemination, or AI, altogether. So Chris wanted to give Walnut a true boyfriend experience. ""Given Walnut’s imprinted nature and apparent attraction to me it seemed like it might be possible to train her to accept the AI without restraint,"" he says. ""I didn’t know if it would work, but I thought I owed it to her to try."" Two months before breeding season began, Chris began to make his move. He was careful and patient: ""She set the pace for the training, it only occurred if she approached me, and would stop if she walked away,"" he says. ""Eventually she would stay still and let me pet her. As soon as breeding season began, she started soliciting me to mate by turning her back, opening and trembling her wings, and lowering her head."" But she still had to be trained to accept Chris’s touch without restraints. By reaching toward her and saying ""touch"" as many times as it took, he taught Walnut to associate the word with sweet, non-threatening caresses. Eventually, Chris won her trust and got the job done.     Chris’ relationship with Walnut has lasted 10 years, longer than any of his human relationships thus far. He and Walnut now have six children and three grandchildren together. At 35 and 38 years young, respectively, Walnut and Chris look forward to many happy years ahead. He visits Walnut three times a day and has no plans for a career change. ""I like to joke that our relationship gives me great job security, but she would eventually bond with another keeper provided they were male and took the time to court her,"" he says. Like that just comes along every day, Chris. ",0.41665390490445786,0.5833460950955421,0.8232330616029917,932,4.780042918454936,508,5.9074803149606296,0,12,"Science, Report"

But with a new ""camera sensor"" designed by CalTech researchers under electrical engineer Ali Hajimiri, you may one day be able to record a 3D scan with nothing other than your smartphone. The tiny chip, called a nanophotonic coherent imager, uses a form of LIDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) technology to capture height, width, and depth information from each pixel. LIDAR, which shines a laser on the target and then analyzes the light waves that are reflected back to the sensor, are best known for their use in precision-guided missile systems and self-driving cars. Each ""pixel"" is a tiny LIDAR While LIDAR itself isn't new, Hajimiri explains that ""by having an array of tiny LIDARs on our coherent imager, we can simultaneously image different parts of an object or a scene without the need for any mechanical movements within the imager."" Each ""pixel"" on the new sensor can individually analyze the phase, frequency, and intensity of the reflected waves, producing a single piece of 3D data. The data from all of the pixels combined can produce a full 3D scan. In addition, the researchers' implementation allows for an incredibly tiny and low-cost scanner, all while maintaining accuracy. According to the researchers, the chip can produce scans that are within microns of the original. The chip produced by the lab currently only has 16 pixels on it — not enough to capture a scan of any real objects without moving it slightly after taking each ""picture."" (That's how they took the scan of the penny above).

By injecting people infected with HIV with a single dose of antibodies, researchers were able to reduce the presence of the virus in the blood of study participants — for 28 days.  This unprecedented result means that it might one day be possible to reduce the frequency of HIV drug intake, or suppress the virus for extended periods of time, following the use of antiretrovirals. Only 1 percent of people who have HIV produce this antibody naturally ""We were able, with the antibodies, to suppress the viral loads of viremic patients — patients that are HIV infected, but that aren’t treated,"" says Florian Klein, co-author of the study published in Nature today, and an immunologist at Rockefeller University in New York. There are more than 1.2 million people living with HIV in the US, according to the CDC. In 2013,  47,300 people living in the country were diagnosed with HIV. For people who know of their condition — and can afford treatment — taking antiretroviral drugs is usually the only option. These drugs are designed to control the infection by preventing the growth of the virus and reducing its presence in the blood of those who are infected. Unfortunately, they need to be taken every day for the rest of a person's life. They can also be pretty harsh on the body; some people experience nerve damage, for instance. To address this issue, researchers have been looking at the antibodies that HIV patients produce naturally to fight the disease upon infection. And one antibody, in particular, stands out. Its name is 3BNC117. It’s ""highly potent,"" and ""very rare,"" Klein says. Only 1 percent of people who have HIV produce this antibody. In the study, the researchers injected 29 people with various doses of the antibody. Of those study participants, 17 were HIV-positive, whereas 12 didn’t have HIV at all. This was the first time that this drug has ever been used in humans, so including people who don’t have HIV in the study helped the researchers determine if the drug is safe. ""a dramatic effect that lasted several weeks."" ""We didn’t see any severe adverse events, only minor ones,"" like headaches, which are hard to link with the drug, Klein says.  Moreover, the researchers were able to reduce the viral loads of the HIV infected patients who weren’t taking antiretrovirals. ""For 28 days, we saw a significant reduction [of the virus in the blood]."" That ""significant reduction"" part is important; it means that although the drug reduced the presence of the virus in the participant’s blood, it wasn’t able to completely suppress the virus — an effect that many people experience when they take antiretrovirals on a daily basis. ""There, virus was still detectable, but it was lower than the amount seen [prior to the treatment],"" Klein says. ""In my view this is the first step in a process to make anti-HIV antibodies into a treatment for HIV/AIDS,"" says Geoffrey Stone, an immunologist at the University of Miami who didn’t work on the study. ""This is a very exciting finding that suggests a new generation of broadly neutralizing antibodies discovered over the last six years can help defeat the virus, says David Montessori, an HIV vaccine researcher at Duke University who also didn’t work on the study. A single dose of the antibodies ""had a dramatic effect that lasted several weeks in patients who were chronically infected with HIV."" However, it’s still unclear if the antibodies will be able to initiate long-term remission with continued drug use, he says. Developing a new kind of HIV drug What’s interesting about this antibody is that although it was able to lower the viral load of study participants for 28 days, it doesn’t actually make a big difference for people who produce it naturally. ""People have looked at whether patients who develop a very good antibody response against HIV if they do better, and that seems to not be the case,"" Klein says. This problem probably has to do with the fact that antibodies develop slowly and start out a very low concentrations. This allows the virus to mutate fairly quickly and avoid being attacked by the antibodies. ""The virus is able to change the sequence of its envelope protein"" — the part of the virus that the antibody detects — ""quite rapidly,"" Klein says. The virus changes its shape, so the antibody can’t bind to it anymore. When you inject a high concentration of the rare antibody into the bodies of people infected with HIV, however, the virus does appear to be affected. Unfortunately, it’s unclear what exactly is going in the body after the injection. ""It’s a work in progress to really understand what the virus is doing,"" Klein says. The antibody treatment is promising, but that’s really all it is. This isn’t the first time that researchers have looked at antibody-based HIV treatments. But Klein says that previous attempts — attempts involving different antibodies — weren’t very successful. ""The effects that were detected weren’t as good and rather not very encouraging,"" he says. This largely has to do with the fact that this antibody is more potent that the ones that have been studied in the past. That ""means that you need more antibodies to neutralize the virus,"" Klein says. Overall, the antibody treatment is promising — but that’s really all it is. The study is very small, so the drug will need to be tested on a lot more people, and for far longer periods of time, before scientists can draw any solid conclusions about its effectiveness. Still, the study may end up leading us down an entirely new avenue for HIV drugs, Klein says. A drug based on this antibody could be used in combination with antiretrovirals, reducing the frequency with which patients might need to take antiretrovirals, Klein says. It’s also possible that it might be able to maintain HIV suppression in someone who has been taking antiretrovirals. Let’s say ""you have a patient that is on antiretrovirals and has no measurable virus in the blood,"" he says. If you then give them an antibody and stop the antiretroviral therapy, the drug might be able to prevent the virus’s return in the blood. That approach would essentially allow patients to go on a ""drug holiday,"" Klein says — at least for a short while. A patient might go on a ""drug holiday"" Finally, an antibody-based drug might one day lead to a new type of HIV preventative. ""These kind of antibodies can protect against infection [in primates],"" Klein says. That application is a long way off in humans, however. To figure out if it can prevent HIV infection in humans, researchers will have to first gain approval for the drug as an HIV treatment. Then, they will have to run a number of large drug trials in an area where the risk of HIV infection is high. This has been done before — an HIV preventative, called Truvada, is recommended by the FDA for anyone who is at risk for infection — but getting that recommendation took a very long time. Still, the possibility of such a preventative is interesting because, unlike Truvada, it probably wouldn’t have to be taken every day. This is only the beginning, Klein says. As the research moves ahead, scientists might be able to modify the antibodies to make them even more potent. ""And with the clinical data that we gain over the next few years, we will hopefully be able to use this method to the benefit of HIV-infected patients,"" Klein says. So ""it’s not ready to go on the market or anything… but we have very promising results.""",0.5060884697503351,0.49391153024966494,0.48768556675378444,1302,4.876344086021505,536,6.2108208955223878,0,0,"Science, Report"

Although the first Brontosaurus was classified in 1879 by famed paleontologist Othniel Charles Marsh, later evaluations in 1903 by one Elmer Riggs suggested that the dinosaur was actually just a younger specimen of the closely related Apatosaurus. The confusion, claimed Riggs, was in the number of bones attaching the tail to the spinal cord. But a new analysis shows that this correction was probably incorrect. brontosaurus means ""thunder lizard"" Using computer algorithms to compare hundreds of anatomical characteristics, an international team of paleontologists carried out the largest-ever analysis of the Diplodocidae family — the family to which both the Brontosaurus and Apatosaurus belong.

However, they're confident their work is exhaustive enough to stand up to the criticism.

IUDs and hormonal implants don't require any effort to use Although the number of teen births in the US has declined by 60 percent since 1991, the adolescent birth rate is still double that of Canada; children aged 15 to 19 gave birth to about 273,000 babies in 2013. But about 90 percent of teens who are sexually active say they use birth control. That's why the new report from the CDC about the best contraception for teenagers is so important: it's meant to ensure that teens don't have children at a time when childbearing carries important economic, health, and social costs for young mothers — and their kids. Most teenagers use condoms and birth control pills, which are only effective when used correctly. IUDs and hormonal implants don't require any effort to use once implanted. About 18 percent of women who use condoms and 9 percent of women who use birth control pills will become pregnant during the first year of use; only 1 percent of women using IUDs and hormonal implants become pregnant the first year they use the contraception. But less than 5 percent of teenagers are using these more-effective methods. To further reduce the number of teen births in the US, the CDC recommends that health care professionals increase access IUDs and hormonal implants. They are ""safe and appropriate for teens,"" said Ileana Arias, CDC Principal Deputy Director, during a press briefing earlier today. And health care professionals play an important role in getting this message across. Hormonal implants and IUDs fall into the ""Long-Acting Reversible Contraception"" (LARC) category of birth control. IUDs — also known as intrauterine devices — are implanted in the uterus, whereas implants are placed in the arm, under the skin, where they provide users with a contraceptive drug. Once in place, these contraceptive methods can be used for a period of three to 10 years without having to be removed.  A lower failure rate than condoms and birth control pills There have been some improvements regarding IUD and implant use over the last 10 years. In 2013, the use of LARCs among female adolescents who sought contraceptive services at federally funded Family Planning centers was a little over 7 percent, compared with 0.4 percent in 2005. ""The use of implants, rather than IUDs accounted for most of the increase in LARC use,"" Arias said. This might have something to do with the perception that a hormonal implant inserted under the skin is less invasive than an IUD. ""Health professionals can encourage teens to not have sex,"" Arias said. But they should also ""recognize LARC as a safe, effective choice of birth control for teens.""  That means speaking with teenagers about the advantages and downsides of LARC use, seeking training in LARC insertion and removal, and having supplies of LARC available. Health care professionals should also ""explore some of the options that exist to cover costs,"" Arias said. Cost is a pretty large barrier to LARC use among teens. An IUD can costs between $500 and $900, and implants cost up to $800. ""Although the costs are high, we are working with our [federally funded] services providers to work with this barrier,"" Arias said. IUDs and implants are expensive, however The cost of implants and IUDs isn't the only barrier, however — geography also appears to play a role. Colorado has the highest teen use of LARC in the country, with 26 percent of female teenagers relying on that method, according to the CDC's study. Yet less than 1 percent of female teenagers in Mississippi use IUDs and implants. This may be because health practitioners in states like Colorado appear to push LARC as a first option more often than other states, said Lee Warner, Associate Director for Science with CDC's Division of Reproductive Health. Colorado has also worked to ensure that doctors and nurses are trained in LARC insertion and removal. That’s why it’s important to get health practitioners in other states on board, Arias said. The CDC isn't alone in its promotion of IUDs and implants among teens. Both the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists have endorsed their use among adolescents. That said, IUDs and implants don't protect against STIs — teenagers and adults alike still need to use a condom for that.",0.42141057256163894,0.5785894274383611,0.8381817244986496,792,4.9987373737373737,375,5.9626666666666663,1,0,"Science, Report"

Generally speaking, high-performance models are differentiated from their tamer stablemates with an outlandish color scheme or aerodynamic enhancements — bigger rims, a splitter here, a scoop there — but not the P85D. I’m told the reason is that adding any parts to the slippery exterior of the Model S would simply slow it down and reduce its range. The only real differentiator (besides the badge) is the understated carbon spoiler brought over from the P85, which makes this car one of the most potent sleepers on the road. On the interior, though, the car makes no effort to hide its own absurdity: in the settings menu, there’s an acceleration option that allows you to toggle quite literally between ""Sport"" and ""Insane"" modes. (For the sake of the demonstration, it was left on ""Insane,"" of course.) The track began at the start of the longest straightaway, where Tesla advised me to take my foot off the brake and slam the accelerator to the floor as quickly as possible, without hesitation, without finesse, without caution or regard for my own life or the lives of those around me. I’m paraphrasing, but that was the gist: there’s no trick to turning the P85D into a guided missile. You just punch it. And so I did. You know that feeling of sheer terror you get as you go over the first crest of a roller coaster? That nauseating mix of inevitability, velocity, and unnatural force being exerted on your body? I got that right here, in those few fleeting moments of unchecked acceleration before the course’s ""BRAKE"" flags whizzed by. I’ve never felt that exact sensation in a car before, and certainly not in a family sedan in a baseball stadium parking lot. As I mentioned in my 2013 review of the single-motor P85, that maxed-out (and now discontinued) model was already something of a monster, delivering linear, face-melting performance at every speed. Well, take the P85 and multiply it a few times over. Empirically, that’s an exaggeration — the D has about 65 percent more horsepower than a P85, 55 percent more torque, and does 0-60 in 3.2 seconds, a second quicker — but somewhere in those numbers lies the terrifying gap between ""very fast car"" and ""I think I’ve wet myself."" While the P85D’s ridiculous performance envelope consumed my senses, I found myself wondering, ""Do we really need to terrify ourselves and our passengers with bursts of acceleration that defy the natural order of the universe?"" No, we don’t. To satisfy the needs of the all-wheel-drive clientele, Tesla could’ve chosen to offer only its lower-performance option, the 376-horsepower 85D — which runs from 0 to 60 in a respectable 5.2 seconds — and call it a day. But let’s be real: I’m awfully glad this car exists. If you love performance cars or spectacular demonstrations of electric powertrains as viable replacements for internal combustion, you should be happy about it, too. There are other cars on the market that are faster from 0 to 60, but because they have to shift gears, they offer you a few milliseconds of respite during hard acceleration. (They also generally cost a lot more.) An all-electric car like the Model S doesn’t have a geared transmission, so those brief opportunities to catch a break from having your body pinned to your seat are mercilessly stolen from you. The P85D is a precision instrument of relentless performance unlike any other car on the road, regardless of price. And again, this car is really just supposed to be about all-wheel drive, not performance. (Imagine if Tesla put its mind to building a true sports car.) To that end, it handled just fine on the course’s snowy section, seamlessly keeping my stupidity in check when I got too friendly with the accelerator. I can’t say it did better than any other car on the market with all-wheel drive and modern accoutrements like traction and stability control, but it performed admirably. Notably, Tesla’s dual-motor system can’t vector torque between the left and right sides the way something like Acura’s SH-AWD can, but that won’t have a noticeable effect on dealing with inclement weather. There’s the Model S’ recently added autonomous driving hardware, too. A parking lot is no place to put something like that to the test, but the company had set up a 25 mph speed limit sign just to show that the car can read it and warn you that you’re going too fast. As CEO Elon Musk said at the P85D’s introduction last year, the hardware’s all there, but the software has to catch up — dynamic cruise control was recently rolled out as an over-the-air update, for instance. The eventual goal is what Tesla calls ""on-ramp to off-ramp"" autonomous driving, meaning you basically never need to touch the steering wheel while you’re on a highway. It’s a hell of a car, but at a base price of over $100,000 and something in the range of $140,000 fully loaded, the P85D is very much the one-percenter’s Tesla. (The spread between a base Model S and a top-of-the-line one is around $70,000.) Most of us will never own one. If, like me, you’re in the 99 percent, take some minor comfort in knowing that the P85D may be too perfect: it’s perfectly balanced, perfectly fast, perfectly planted on the road. Perfection begets sterility, and a sterile car lacks character. Top Gear’s Jeremy Clarkson famously waged a similar complaint against the devastatingly good Nissan GT-R several years ago.

The bike's frame and rims are coated with ""hundreds of thousands"" of retroreflective spheres, which send light that hits them directly back to where they came from. The reflection is apparently visible up to 1,000 feet away. Mission Bicycle believes that Lumen will be the first commercially available retroreflective bike, and it plans to start shipping some of them out as rewards beginning in July. It's looking to raise $15,000 for the project, and it's already almost two-thirds of the way there. Backers can receive a single-speed city bike for $1,245 or an eight speed for $1,595. Those who know their way around a bike may instead want to opt for a less expensive option, receiving just a frame and fork for $499. It's a surprisingly stylish bike for how functional its coating is, and it's a smart way to address a recurring problem. Still, it wouldn't hurt to put a light on it too.

Earlier today, it gave a first peek at Android Wear, a version of its mobile operating system designed specifically for wearable devices. So far, Google has shown quite a bit of what shape the OS will take when it comes to watches in particular: it imagines Android Wear running on both square and circular displays, and it relies heavily on Google Now to augment the simple swipes that control it. In Google's vision, a smartwatch is focused on a single task at once, but is often displaying two different things. Critical information is placed on the bottom of the screen, while a contextual background usually appears above it. In some cases, rich information appears in the background too: when using a map, Google Maps will appear in the background while route information is shown on the larger bottom portion of the display. While Google has only shown Android Wear on concept devices, Motorola and LG both showed off what they say their first Android smartwatches will actually look like too. Altogether, it's a dramatically different look from recent smartwatches — even powerful ones like Samsung's Android-powered Galaxy Gear. And it's a huge shift from what we saw on earlier smartwatches like the Pebble. This is what Google wants the smartwatch to look like, and if hardware manufacturers can keep up with its ambitious vision, anyone who isn't making a watch this capable is going to have a lot to contend with.

The ride-sharing service faced anger from local taxi drivers, upset that amateur drivers were undercutting their fares. Where Uber doesn't require that its UberX drivers have any special licenses, private Seoul taxi drivers can reportedly expect to pay around 70 million won ($63,477) for the proper documentation. The service also faced staunch opposition from local authorities: Korea's Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport declared that the ride-sharing app was illegal before it officially launched, and other branches of the administration made it clear that Uber would not be welcome in the country. ""As soon as testing phases are over,"" a spokesperson for the Seoul city government said in September, ""our dedicated squad will begin clamping down on Uber drivers.""

The new legislation — known as Directive 2008/8/EC — comes into force on January 1st and is intended to shut down a tax loophole being used by big firms to charge less VAT (value added tax) on digital goods. Although not many individuals will be happy about the prospect of paying more for their games and movies, proponents of the bill say it will level the playing field between small and large companies and create a fairer market. Critics reply that the compliance costs will ruin small businesses.  Big internet firms currently book their sales from low-tax countries As the law currently stands, businesses selling digital goods in Europe only have to charge customers the VAT of the country the firms are based in. This allows companies like Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, and Google to set up small offices in countries with favorable VAT rates and register all their European sales there. Luxembourg, for example, is a tiny nation just 82 kilometers long, but its low VAT rates on ebooks (just 3 percent) mean that it’s home to Amazon’s European ""headquarters."" The company's 500 Luxembourg staff may pale in comparison to the size of its London operation (where it is currently building a 600,000 sq ft office with a planned capacity of 5,000) but all Amazon sales made in Europe are nonetheless routed through Luxembourg. By forcing the retailer to charge VAT on ebooks at local rates (20 percent in the UK for example), the EU says it's making it easier for smaller, local companies to compete with the American giant. It's expected that companies will simply pass the costs on to consumers Google Play, iTunes, and all of Amazon's digital stores will be affected by the changes, but it will be up to individual rights holders — that could be developers, music labels, or movie studios — to decide what to do with their prices. Although there's no consensus about what will happen, it's broadly expected that it's the customers that will have to absorb the new VAT rates. A cartoon appearing in the Financial Times in February summed up the business world's likely reaction: ""This is either going to cost us, or the consumer. Give me a nanosecond to decide which..."" An album download that currently costs £11.99 ($18.65) based on Luxembourg's 15 percent VAT rate will cost £13.78 ($21.44) when adjusted to the UK's local rate of 20 percent. This 5 percent increase is only slightly below the average. Only Malta, Cyprus, and Germany are lower (18 percent, 19 percent, and 19 percent respectively) and most countries charge nearer to 22 percent, with Hungary home to the highest rates (27 percent). Some shoppers however, might be in for a pleasant surprise: Google's digital stores are based in Ireland where VAT is 23 percent. Google Play might actually get cheaper for some shoppers — it's currently based in Ireland where VAT is 23 percent A multitude of rates is not going to affect consumers, but many small business owners and sole traders say that the costs and administrative burdens will be crippling, with some 34,000 businesses affected in the UK alone. However, the EU directive also stipulates that governments set up ""one-stop shops"" to deal with the admin for these companies. In the UK, micro-businesses have complained that this means losing their VAT-exempt status (applicable if they sell less than £81,000 annually) but the government has replied that they can avoid this if they split their businesses to EU and UK-only divisions. It seems that there is no way of avoiding some administrative burden for companies of all sizes — but at least it can be tackled in one go.

Co-workers are idly curious about which smartwatch or fitness band that is; my girlfriend asks why it’s so ugly and when I’ll take it off. A few, like the Moto 360, prompt strangers to stop me on the street or subway and ask if that’s what they think it is. (Yes, it is. Yeah it’s cool, I guess. No, sorry, I can’t let you wear it.)  No one asked about the Withings Activité. I don’t think anyone knows they should.  I’ve been wearing it for a week. It’s one part standard wristwatch, one part fitness tracker. It tracks your sleep, steps, and activity. It costs $450. It’s beautiful: made of carefully machined sapphire, calf leather, and stainless steel. It looks like a watch in the most traditional sense.  It’s exactly what you think it is, exactly what it should be. It’s not the future of smartwatches — it’s not even a smartwatch. It’s just a watch, with more in common with century-old chronographs and calculator watches than the Apple Watch. And the Activité, or something like it, is almost certainly the future of watches.  The Activité (pronounced Ac-ti-vi-TAY) is made in Switzerland. It’s Swiss Made. I know this because it’s written three times on the long, slender white box the watch comes in, and because it’s also written twice on the watch itself. Despite the in-your-face overpromotion, Swiss Made is actually a big deal. It’s a phrase carefully regulated by the Swiss government, one designed to make sure that the ""Swiss watch"" label is given only to timepieces of the highest quality. The Activité certainly earns its label. It’s beautiful, carefully assembled, and yet ruggedly ready for anything you throw at it. Its stainless-steel case is almost invisible from the front, which is given almost entirely to the dome-shaped sapphire glass above the dials. When I spoke to Withings CEO Cedric Hutchings in June, he raved about what he called the double-curved glass, saying it has ""a very tiny reflection."" There are moments, when the light catches on the glass just-so, when I get what he means. For the most part, though, the reflections on the domed glass just make it harder to tell the time unless I’m looking at the watch exactly head-on. I don’t mind the look, and I love the way the watch’s face feels to my fingers — smooth, sleek, organic. I’d just rather the Activité be a little thinner and a little flatter. One size doesn't quite fit all That’s my only real complaint about the Activité: it’s just thick enough to catch on my shirtsleeve, or my coat, or the headphone cord of the unlucky guy standing next to me on the subway. It’s not a big watch, just a tall one. Actually, at a decidedly unisex 36.3mm in diameter and 1.3 ounces, I suspect buyers are more likely to complain it’s too small. Ditto the brown leather strap that came with my review unit, which is thin, finely stitched, and measurably nicer than the leather band I bought for my Seiko last year. It’s also available in only one unisex size, for now, and my decidedly average-size wrists were just barely small enough to fit. Withings was actually surprisingly successful in making a single device that men or women can wear, but there are plenty of people for whom the small included strap just won’t work. On the Activité’s round face, which comes in either black or white, are two dials. The first does that ticking thing a watch does and tells the time (but not the date, which I wish it did). It’s beautifully simple, 12 silver dashes around the side, a Withings logo under the 12 and the words ""Swiss Made"" surrounding the 6. (Did you forget it was Swiss Made? How dare you!) Down in the bottom right, there’s another dial. It counts from 0 to 100, with marks at intervals of ten. It’s the Activité’s one and only clue as to the technology that lies inside, and it’s there that this becomes more than just a timepiece. If you have an iPhone, the Activité syncs its data via Bluetooth to Withings’ Health Mate app. (Android support is coming soon, I’m told.) That’s the highest-tech thing that it does. Then, whenever you’re wearing the watch, it tracks your activity: your steps, your sleep, your swimming. It’s not a particularly sophisticated workout device, just a simple activity tracker. It’s all but invisible as it works. The only indication is the hand on that second dial sweeping from 0 to 100, displaying the percentage of your step goal you’ve reached so far today. After a five-minute long set-up process — in which you use an included pin-like tool to turn the watch on, connect it to your phone, and set the time by spinning a dial on your phone — you never have to do anything on the watch itself again. Every setting, every feature exists only on your phone, and a lot of the Activité’s job happens automatically. Its algorithms figure out what you’re doing and track each activity differently. I actually wish there were more I could do on the timepiece itself, but I don't mind the way it works here. The watch is meant never to come off your wrist. Its battery (which is just a watch battery) lasts eight months, and there’s even a second one in the box. It’s water-resistant enough to wear in the shower, as long as you switch to the included silicone strap instead of the very much not-water-resistant leather. Its silent alarm buzzes your wrist to wake you up at the appointed time, so you’re even meant to wear it to sleep. Sleeping was the only time I didn’t wear it; having anything on my wrist, especially something as coldly metallic as the Activité, makes it hard to fall asleep. The alarm itself is annoying, too: you can’t turn it off, you just have to wait the 30 seconds or so while it buzzes on your wrist. I literally flung it across the room while it was still buzzing, one particularly early morning. The Health Mate app is fairly standard activity-tracking fare. There are lovely graphs of your activity and sleep over time, and badges for when you do things like meet your step goal or sleep particularly well. You can have Withings friends who you challenge to take more steps or lose more weight. If you use a Withings scale, a Pulse fitness band, or the Aura sleep tracker, they all funnel more and better data into the same place. It also collects data from RunKeeper and similar apps, and can send it to Apple Health. The more data you collect, the more useful Health Mate becomes: it can tell you that you took fewer steps today than on an average Wednesday, or that you need to be more active in order to sleep better. The app can also programmatically remind you to, say, drink more water or get to bed early. The reminders amount to basically having your mother around yelling ""Bedtime!"" at 11:15 every night, which I loved. Health Mate isn’t a terribly beautiful or intuitive app, but it does everything it needs to, and it’s getting better all the time. None of that, of course, has much to do with the Activité. All the watch does is feed data into that system. If you tap on the sapphire, the hands will quickly rearrange to show you what time your alarm will go off, but otherwise there’s no two-way interaction at all. In a way that’s frustrating, because you need your phone to do everything, including set the time, but it’s actually quite clever. Since the Activité is just a dumb data-collection device, you’ll never need to upgrade it to get new functionality. Withings can upgrade the Activité’s firmware to read more and more accurately, and it can update its app to do absolutely everything else. Most smartwatches, especially above a certain price, are going to run into an upgrade problem: why would I spend a thousand dollars on a watch I’m going to need to upgrade in a year? The Activité doesn’t have that problem, because it doesn’t try to do anything. You’ll upgrade your phone in a year, Withings will update its app far more frequently than that, and suddenly your watch will become even more useful. The lesson of the Activité is how trivially easy it is to add these data-collection tools to a wristwatch. Sure, it decreases the battery life, but certainly not enough to be an issue; it definitely doesn’t require any real design compromise. It’s an almost exclusively additive process, making the thing you wear on your wrist more than just a device for telling the time. Why can't every watch become a slightly smarter watch? If it’s a smartwatch, it’s the least capable smartwatch I’ve ever seen. What the Activité actually represents is the new table stakes for a watch, the new minimum for a device that looks like this and costs this much. Watches can already blare sound to wake you up in the morning, so why can’t they buzz quietly? Why can’t I swap bands before I get in the pool and have it track my splits? It’s all clearly possible, and I don’t think it’ll be long before those features are as commonplace as a sweeping second-hand. Rolex, Timex, and Bulgari have all already done the hard part: building a beautiful watch. So did Withings. And it proved that the other half, the technological half, doesn’t require sacrifice. The price alone will turn off a lot of people, but if you’re willing to spend for a good watch this is certainly a real option. But don’t spend $450 on the Withings Activité because it’s the latest and greatest, or because it offers some new or remarkable functionality, or because it’ll be the envy of your friends. It’s none of those things, and that may be the best thing about the Withings Activité. It’s both deeply technical and not at all so. It feels like a watch you’ll keep and care for, not a gadget you’ll throw by the wayside in a year or two. The only people who notice it will tell you it’s a nice watch, not inquire about that crazy bracelet or computer on your wrist. Smartwatches have a long way to go before they have mainstream appeal, but a slightly smarter watch? I’m in.

And it's all over for the flagship #Samsung Experienced store in @westfieldstrat #signofthetimes pic.twitter.com/P03eNivsab  In a statement to The Verge, Samsung expressed regret at the store's closure, saying, ""We remain fully committed to the operation of the remaining nine Samsung Experience Stores across the UK, and wish to reassure our customers that those stores will not be affected by this decision."" Along with a centrally located Oxford Street shop, this was Samsung's biggest — and thus most expensive and ostentatious — exhibition space in London. Samsung made a big point of promoting its Experience Stores, making them the destination to get the very first Galaxy S4 and, later, S5 units sold in the UK, but excitement and sales have apparently petered out after a strong start. Now that Samsung no longer sells laptops in Europe, and with mobile sales shrinking, it's reasonable for the company to cut down on its retail costs, of which the marquee Westfield location would have been a major part. Though Samsung is no longer headlining one of Europe's biggest malls with its presence, the rest of its own-brand stores across the UK will persist as local hubs that can show off the Korean company's formidable product portfolio. Plans for future expansion, though, such as the 60 new retail spots across Europe that were announced at the start of this year, may have to be revised in light of Samsung's recent fortunes.",0.35079648982655987,0.6492035101734401,0.8479998919525245,338,5.1597633136094672,217,5.9631336405529956,0,0,"Business, Mobile, Tech"

Now it's also decided to try targeting the means of disseminating that information — Motherboard reports the company has promised to sue Twitter unless it bans accounts that are linking to the leaks. The threat was made in a letter sent by Sony lawyer David Boies to VIjaya Gadde, Twitter's general counsel, and conveyed that the company would ""hold Twitter responsible for any damage or loss arising"" from the use or continued dissemination of the stolen information. In the letter — which was similar to one sent to publications including The Verge last week — Boies said that his client ""does not consent to Twitter's or any Twitter account holder's possession, review, copying, dissemination, publication, uploading, downloading, or making any use of the Stolen Information,"" and that Sony requests Twitter's cooperation in suspending any accounts found to be sharing the leaked data. Sony asked that Twitter share the threat with one user who had been linking to the leaks The letter reportedly requests that Twitter share details of the threat with a specific user: musician Val Broeksmit. Broeksmit, who tweets as @bikinirobotarmy, previously received a direct message from Sony copyright expert Ellliot Ingram after he linked to emails obtained in the cyberattack. ""Rather than complaining to Twitter and risk them taking action against your account,"" the mail read, ""we thought we'd get in touch first and ask if you would remove the tweets that we've identified."" Broeksmit told Motherboard he didn't take the letter seriously, but that his Twitter account was temporarily suspended. Social networking site Reddit has taken to banning users who post links to Sony's stolen information, but Twitter has yet to adopt a formal stance to the issue. Under the service's rules, users are not allowed to post personal and private data in tweets themselves, but Twitter says it can't apply that rule to other sites and stop users linking to such information.

Keurig Green Mountain has announced a recall affecting roughly 7 million of its K10 Mini Plus Brewing Systems manufactured between 2009 and 2014. That's a long time, so if you already own one of the K10 units, you can see if you're part of the recall by checking out its serial number; if it starts with 31, you should probably request a repair kit and Starbucks handle your coffee needs for now.  If the number on this label starts with 31, you're at risk of getting burned. If you don't, you run the risk of being sprayed with scalding hot water — which is really the worst possible outcome of interacting with a coffee maker. Keurig's already received 90 burn-related injury reports, so it's a legitimate threat. The company says it's gotten over 200 reports from customers documenting hot liquid escaping from the K10, and the problem seems to occur most often when customers prepare more than two cups in quick succession.

From 8PM Wednesday until 3AM Thursday, you can get you to your destination at a cost that is likely less than its rivals.     There's fine print worth reading: the $10 fare is only good if your regular fare would have been less than $50; after the first $50, you have to pay the balance of the ride.

And while the flat rate is likely to increase demand on lesser-known Flywheel, the company says they're incentivizing drivers with a 100 percent tip on every ride, paid by Flywheel.

The online retailer also said that same-day delivery saw huge growth this year. Customers ordered ""10 times as many items"" with same-day delivery compared to 2013, but in typical Amazon fashion, we're left without any hard numbers. The company's quest to provide instant gratification to its customers will ramp up further in 2015, according to CEO Jeff Bezos.

Amazon said that 60 percent of customers placed an order from a smartphone or tablet over the holidays, with mobile purchases peaking on Cyber Monday. To get a sense of the frenzy, take this example: globally, Amazon customers ordered 18 toys per second using mobile devices on Cyber Monday. Clearly people have come to realize it's a better option than scratching and clawing over a Frozen Elsa doll at Toys 'R Us. As for what else consumers bought, Amazon is claiming victory for its own Fire devices in the ""most popular tablets"" category. The Fire TV Stick is ""Amazon's fastest-selling device ever."" Does that mean it's outpacing Chromecast? Again, Amazon doesn't say. Regular e-reader Kindles also sold in healthy numbers; Black Friday sales were four times higher than last year. Most of the big winners aren't altogether surprising. Chromebooks led laptop sales, with Acer's C720 taking top honors. Consumers flocked to the latest Call of Duty game. GoPro had another huge year in cameras. And just about everyone snatched up an Amazon Basics HDMI cable. Amazon's still a fan of converting its sales into fun facts, too.

The bill is meant to help network operators share information about possible threats more quickly and easily, making it easier to defend against any subsequent attacks. ""Our bill will ensure that we have the tools to address these attacks by enabling voluntary information sharing of cyber threats between and among the private and public sectors,"" Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) said in a statement. It's a crucial issue, particularly in the wake of ongoing criminal and state hacks like Home Depot, Target, and Sony Pictures, but many have criticized the new crop of info-sharing bills as opening the door to private sector surveillance. Ron Wyden criticized CISA, an earlier info-sharing bill, as ""a surveillance bill by another name."" Others have raised questions about how government agencies will use the threat information after it's been reported. ""Any company has to think at least twice about sharing how they are vulnerable with a government that hoards security vulnerabilities and exploits them to conduct massive surveillance,"" Stanford Law Professor Jennifer Granick wrote in a recent editorial. ""Congress must act to improve our cybersecurity."" For both advocates and critics, the biggest issue has been liability. Network operators want to ensure they can't be prosecuted for sharing threat data that might be seen as private or proprietary. At the same time, privacy advocates want to ensure that liability isn't taken as a blank check to spy on users. The new bill contains a number of scrubs of personal information, but it's still unclear if the measures will be enough to mollify critics. Still, the fact that the bill could pass such a divided House suggests strong support within Washington for the measures, and a number of members of Congress have already come forward with vocal support for the measure.

The document lists 32 ""online platforms"" — mostly US-based, among them Amazon, Google, and Etsy — that could exercise major power over the rest of the economy. The paper suggests the possibility of creating a new ""supervision framework"" to oversee such companies — new regulations could ban companies from, say, favoring their own services over another company's. (This has been a focus in the antitrust charges against Google.) The regulations could also prevent companies from using their power to keep sellers from offering goods for less money on other services. To make sure those regulations are enforced, the paper suggests a new ""EU-wide body"" could be created to oversee the companies, according to the Journal. That regulator would have the power to scrutinize information on how the companies use data, and to act as an intermediary in any disputes. The idea of a new regulator is a long way from becoming law. As the Journal points out, the ideas would have to be formally proposed and approved by European governments.

(The GameCube, Wii, and Wii U can't even play DVDs.) But TVii sought to change that — the second-screen app let users search through the catalogs of streaming video services and peruse the TV guide right from the Gamepad. It even had customized recommendations and an odd social aspect that let you discuss and vote on shows and sports matches with other Nintendo users through Miiverse. ""Every service has a life cycle, and it is time to focus our resources on other projects."" Nintendo removed the helpful universal search functionality last year, and now TVii is dead for good. In a FAQ, the company explains the decision to shutter TVii curtly: ""Every service has a life cycle, and it is time to focus our resources on other projects."" We wouldn't say that TV-viewing and second-screen apps are quite so passé, but it seems Nintendo decided it just wanted no part in your home theater stack. It never really tried in the first place, after all. TVii will disappear for good on August 11th, but you'll still be able to watch streaming video content from Netflix, Hulu, Amazon, and others even without the service. And that TV button on the GamePad? Well, you'll still be able to use it to change the volume and channel, if that's any consolation.",0.6238992324190072,0.37610076758099276,0.1836794148876171,303,4.7095709570957096,184,5.4021739130434785,0,0,"Culture, Entertainment, Gaming, Home, Tech"

Game consoles were first banned in 2000 due to fears that the devices — and the 3D worlds produced by them — had a negative effect on the mental and physical development of children. Last year, China eased those restrictions by letting game console-makers operate in an experimental 11-square-mile area in Shanghai, known as the free trade zone. China has a choice to make: PS4 or Xbox One But even those relaxed restrictions proved to be a major hurdle to console makers, which had to enter into contracts to build new manufacturing facilities in the area.

Those restrictions have now been tossed entirely, opening up a massive new market for game consoles.

""This framework would cut off every pathway that Iran could take to develop a nuclear weapon,"" Obama said. Final terms of the deal still have to be negotiated, which is scheduled to happen by the end of June.  ""This framework would cut off every pathway that Iran could take to develop a nuclear weapon."" Under terms of the deal's framework, Iran would have to dramatically reduce the number of centrifuges it has — cutting them by around two-thirds — because they can be used to create materials for a weapon. The remaining centrifuges would be older, less-advanced models. Among other limitations, the framework also has Iran agreeing to reduce uranium enrichment levels and maintaining far smaller stockpiles of enriched uranium, dropping from 10,000kg today to 300kg over the next 15 years. Vox reports that this structure will allow Iran to maintain nuclear power plans. The framework also allows Iran to convert one of its facilities into a research center studying nuclear science, physics, and technology. The center will not be able to investigate uranium enrichment for the next 15 years. Terms of the framework would also give UN inspectors ""regular access"" to Iran's facilities and supply chain. Most terms of the framework end after 10 or 15 years. The negotiations included the US, UK, France, Germany, Russia, China, and the European Union. Obama credits collaborative sanctions with convincing Iran to talk and ultimately move toward agreeing to a deal. While the framework would not result in all sanctions against Iran being lifted — such as those relating to terrorism and human rights abuses — sanctions relating to its nuclear program will be lifted.

""this vaccine could be further tested in large phase III studies in West Africa"" Since the beginning of the current outbreak, Ebola has infected over 25,000 people and claimed the lives of 10,000 people, most of whom reside in West Africa. Ebola isn't air borne; transmission can be controlled through routine hand-washing and by using barriers to prevent contact with infectious bodily fluids. Still, doctors don't have a cure for Ebola and the death toll continues to rise. This is why scientists are actively searching for a way to protect people who live in regions where the virus is present. In the study, researchers vaccinated 158 healthy volunteers in Kenya, Switzerland, and Germany with a placebo, or various doses of an Ebola vaccine called rVSV-ZEBOV. In the weeks that followed, the researchers measured the volunteers' immunological responses to the drug, and checked them for negative side effects. About 35 percent of the participants developed a fever following the vaccination. Another 22 percent developed arthritis in one to four joints, with pain lasting about eight days — a side-effect that still needs to be investigated. None of the study participants experienced serious vaccine-related side effects, however.

But until it's tested in an area where people are actually at risk for Ebola, we won't really know if it can protect people from the disease. Still, giving the vaccine to healthy volunteers helped the researchers determine which doses of the vaccines should be used on humans in future trials. This was a preliminary report, says study co-author and University of Geneva pathologist Claire-Anne Siegrist. The researchers haven't finished gathering data from the 158 study participants; they will find out more about the vaccine's effects as they continue to monitor them.

But there’s a lot of work between that and figuring out what our bodies are actually doing when we dream. Now, a group of researchers at UCBL in Lyon, France say they’ve found a link between REM sleep and a few specific areas of the brain — at least in rats. It hasn’t cracked the puzzle of dreams, but it might point the way towards some valuable clues. Humans (and rats) cycle through several stages of sleep every night, and dreaming is possible across multiple stages. But the vivid, elaborate dreams we tend to remember most clearly occur during REM (rapid eye movement) sleep. There's a lot of similarity between imagining doing something in this state and deciding to do it in real life — if our muscles weren't usually paralyzed, we'd start to act out our dreams. The brain activity that produces them, though, is quite different. This latest research found that in rats, REM sleep is associated with only a handful of substructures, which might ultimately be controlled by an even smaller set of structures. Past research has found that when humans enter REM sleep, there's unusually high activity in areas of the brain related to memory and learning. But Dr. Pierre-Hervé Luppi, a co-author on the study that was published today in Science Advances, says it’s been hard to pinpoint exactly how different this is to normal patterns. ""The previous theory was that waking and REM sleep were more similar states,"" he says. Now, he believes that this activity is limited to a select few areas, compared to our waking brains. ""The previous theory was that waking and REM sleep were more similar states."" Unlike humans, rats can be sacrificed in order to examine their brains in closer detail. At UCBL, the team focused on an indirect measurement of mental activity, checking the expression of specific genes in various parts of the brain. To figure out what expression was specific to REM sleep, they divided the rats into three groups: a control group that slept normally, a second group that had REM sleep disrupted for three days, and a third group that was also deprived of REM sleep but given time to recover. These hypersomniac rats, as they were called, spent significantly more time in REM sleep before being euthanized, and they showed significantly more gene expression in five particular structures — indicating that they play a role in dreams. The structures were part of the limbic system, which is linked with both emotion and memory. Human studies have already suggested that the limbic system is important to dreaming. Luppi says that his team’s research narrows that down further, to particular groups of neurons. ""In humans they knew, okay, it's around there, but now we have a good definition,"" he says. But the work goes further than that. As a next step, researchers looked for what might be ""turning on"" these neurons. By injecting tracers around them, they followed a path back to two structures. In theory, this path would work both ways: if you disabled these structures, known as the supramammillary nucleus and the claustrum, the activity would stop. This wasn't tested completely, but researchers did manage to find more evidence of a direct link. In a followup experiment, they created lesions on some rats’ supramammillary nuclei, then checked their brains against a control group. Activity, it turned out, had dropped in one key REM-related area. Two substructures might play a big role in how we dream The problem is that Luppi and his team don’t really know what any of these groups or pathways are doing during REM sleep. ""Really, what is the function of the activation of these neurons?"" he asks. Like other researchers, he believes that memory and emotion are involved, but that’s a fairly general statement, and more specific tests are needed. Fortunately, he says, these results will give them a place to start. Specifically, it’s possible to stop one of these structures from functioning during REM sleep and study the effect this has on an animal. ""Do they have problems with emotional behavior?"" he says. ""Do they have problems with learning? What type of learning?"" Researchers, of course, have been working for a long time on the toll that dream deprivation can take on humans and animals. Luppi points to research demonstrating that animals become less adept at learning if they’re denied REM sleep. ""There is already a link,"" he says. ""But we don't know exactly where in the brain, [or] what is happening exactly in the brain."" Luppi says that the team started applying its newly published research long ago. ""This article took us 11 years, to put everything together. So it's a huge work. But it means that also during the last two or three years, we already started the next step,"" he says. That said, don’t bank on anyone finding the true meaning of your dreams — or the precise role of anything in our extraordinarily complex brains — soon. A moment later, he's joking that it might take 10 more years to publish the team’s next big leap.",0.6148191498385176,0.3851808501614824,0.8616607892292721,865,4.9132947976878611,455,5.9824175824175825,0,0,Science

The drug-resistant bacteria that causes the illness has infected 243 people across 32 US states and Puerto Rico between May 2014 and February 2015. As a result, the CDC recommends decreasing the use of antibiotics to treat mild forms of Shigellosis. If health care providers fail to reduce the number of cases, we could end up seeing ""large, protracted outbreaks,"" the CDC report says. watery or bloody diarrhea, abdominal pain, and fever People infected with Shigellosis go through painful bouts of watery or bloody diarrhea, abdominal pain, and fever. It spreads quickly from person to person through food and recreational water, such as pools. It's usually resolved within a week, but it can be pretty painful. This is why the CDC is concerned about Shigellosis; until recently, drug-resistant forms of Shigella — the bacteria that causes Shigellosis — were very rare in the US. But over the last year, international travelers returning to the US have repeatedly introduced the pathogen into the country. When diarrhea arises, some travelers take antibiotics to make it stop more quickly. This isn't ideal because the antibiotic that people are typically given to treat diarrhea when they’re traveling abroad — ciprofloxacin — is becoming less effective, the CDC says. Moreover, most of the bacteria that causes Shigellosis is already resistant to a number of other antibiotics in the US. ""Drug-resistant infections are harder to treat and because Shigella spreads so easily between people, the potential for more — and larger — outbreaks is a real concern,"" CDC director Tom Frieden said in a statement. ""We’re moving quickly to implement a national strategy to curb antibiotic resistance because we can’t take for granted that we’ll always have the drugs we need to fight common infections."" ""Shigella spreads so easily between people."" Drug resistance develops when bacteria comes into contact with antibiotics at doses that are too low to kill them. When that happens, bacteria adapts to the drug and passes their newly developed resistance on to subsequent generations. It’s unclear exactly why drug-resistant Shigella has increased in the US, but it’s likely that this has something to do with people who don’t finish taking the antibiotics that have been prescribed to them. Large clusters of drug-resistant Shigellosis have been detected in Massachusetts, California, and Pennsylvania. Half of the cases identified by the CDC were linked to travelers who had been to India and the Dominican Republic. But some domestic clusters are beginning to emerge. So far, 95 drug-resistant cases have been recorded by the San Francisco Department Department of Public Health. And of those 95 cases, half were infections affecting people who are homeless and people living in single-room occupancy hotels. The US sees about 500,000 cases of diarrhea linked to Shigellosis every year — most of these cases aren't drug resistant, however. To prevent transmission of the drug-resistant bacteria, the CDC recommends washing your hands with soap and water. International travelers can prevent infection  by eating hot foods and drinking fluids directly from sealed containers.",0.561734069041609,0.43826593095839095,0.8214852437474303,537,5.3817504655493487,293,6.1467576791808876,1,0,"Science, US & World"

In the study, researchers sequenced the genomes of tumors belonging to three patients with stage III melanoma, as well as the patients’ own genomes. They used those sequenced genomes to identify ""neoantigens"" — proteins located on the surface of cancer cells — that are uniquely expressed by each patient’s melanoma tumor.  This was a challenge, says study co-author and oncologist Beatriz Carreno, because a patient with melanoma can have hundreds of neoantigens on her or his tumor. So, the researchers spent a lot of time trying to figure out which proteins ""were more likely to elicit a strong immune response against the tumor."" Eventually, the researchers selected seven neoantigens for each patient. Then, they produced patient-specific vaccines that contained these neoantigens. By including the neoantigens in the vaccine, the researchers sought to activate that immune system and increase the production of cancer-fighting cells. Finally, the researchers administered three doses of the vaccines to each patient over the course of 18 weeks. a rich pool of tumor-specific immune cells that stay dormant — unless activated by a vaccine The results are promising. For each patient, the immune system recognized three of the seven neoantigens contained in the vaccines. As a result, patients that received the vaccines produced more cancer-fighting T cells and, more importantly, produced more different kinds of T cells. This is kind of a big deal, the researchers say; it means that cancer patients have a potentially rich pool of tumor-specific immune cells that stay dormant — unless they're activated by a vaccine. ""Our team is very encouraged by the quality of the immune response directed against the melanoma neoantigens in all three patients,"" says Gerald Linette, a co-author of the study and an oncologist at Washington University. The vaccine appears to be safe; it didn’t cause any negative side-effects. But the technique isn't a cure for cancer. It's more like a cancer-fighting power-up for the human immune system. ""The one patient that began the study in remission remains in complete remission with no evidence of cancer,"" Linette says. ""In the other two patients, one had a two-month regression of lung metastases, while the other patient has had stable disease."" All the patients appear to be in stable condition at the moment, he added.  Because the study only included three patients, it really only serves to show that this technique is feasible. Researchers will have to conduct more studies in order to determine the treatment’s effectiveness. Still, the scientists are hopeful. The fact that the cells in the vaccine are patient-specific means cause the production of the immune cells that are very ""precise in their recognition and elimination of the patient’s own cancer,"" Linette told The Verge. He thinks the technique could also be used to treat lung cancer, bladder cancer, and colorectal cancer.  ""It opens the door to personalized immune-oncology."" The researchers will have to work on making vaccine production more efficient. It took the researchers four months to make these three vaccines. This could be a problem for patients who need a boost right away, so the researchers are working on cutting down the manufacturing time. Eventually, they might be able to make the personalized vaccines in a month. ""It opens the door to personalized immune-oncology,"" Linette says. The treatment won’t replace current therapies, but it might make fighting off cancer a bit easier. Combining this tailored therapy with other immunotherapies ""constitutes a natural progression — one that we will be pursuing in the near future.""",0.3534733285727689,0.6465266714272311,0.8139767029688957,731,5.3392612859097124,343,6.3994169096209914,0,0,"Science, Report"

The Large Hadron Collider is reborn — on Easter weekend, of course. After shutting it down for two years in February 2013, the world's biggest and most powerful particle accelerator is up and running again. That doesn't mean that it's going at full power though, says Paul Collier, head of beams at CERN. Getting it to the acceleration needed to collect collision data — and perform actual physics experiments — is going to take two months. ""It’s not like flipping a switch, that’s for sure."" ""It’s not like flipping a switch, that’s for sure,"" Collier says. CERN's physicists first have to increase the machine's energy over time. ""We’re talking early to mid-June, when we can take the first high energy data, [but] at this stage the collision rate will be fairly low,"" he says. ""The next stage, which is done in parallel with data taking, is to steadily increase the number of protons."" Increasing the number of protons means increasing the number of collisions inside the machine, and the temperature therein. By the end of 2015, the energy of the particle beams circulating inside the LHC will have reached their peak — an energy that has never before been achieved by a particle accelerator.  The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is a $10 billion particle accelerator in Geneva, Switzerland. Its operation led to the discovery of the Higgs Boson, an elementary particle, in 2012. The finding — which is still being debated — filled in the last major gap of a 40-year-long quest to complete the Standard Model of particle physics, one of physics' most important theories. Still, the Standard Model is an incomplete theory. Another theory, called supersymmetry, suggests there is an undiscovered partner particle for each one in the Standard Model. Those proposed particles are among those that scientists at CERN hope to detect now that the LHC has been rebooted. One predicted particle is called a ""dark matter particle."" Dark matter is a mysterious and invisible substance — it doesn't absorb, emit or reflect light — that physicists say makes up 26 percent of our universe. Because of the changes that were made at the LHC, researchers now think that it might be possible to create the particle that constitutes dark matter, and infer its presence from the amount of energy that's ""missing"" after a particle collision occurs. Particles aren't all, though: LHC scientists will also be looking out for evidence of exotic phenomena like rolled-up dimensions and tiny black holes. the LHC is now 60 percent more powerful than it was in 2012 The LHC was shut down in 2013 because 10,000 electrical interconnections between the machine's supercooled magnets needed to be reinforced. ""We basically spent two years reinforcing these junctions, such that they can withstand anything that we can throw at them in terms of the energy of the machine,"" Collier says. The last few months have been spent cooling the machine down — the LHC operates at 1.9 Kelvin, or -456 Fahrenheit  — and checking all the electrical circuits to make sure that there aren't any issues. The LHC's reboot was actually planned for earlier in the year, but a short circuit affecting one of the magnets delayed the activation. ""We hope it’s a minor problem with one of the circuits,"" Collier told The Verge last week, before the issue was resolved on March 31st. ""What we’ve put together is almost a new machine,"" Collier says. ""And, of course, we’re also booting it into a new regime in terms of the power of the machine — the energy at which the beams collide."" Because of the changes that the scientists made, the LHC is now 60 percent more powerful than it was in 2012.

As far as USDOT secretary Anthony Foxx is concerned, pretty much everything is in bad shape and getting worse: roadways, railways, waterways, the whole nine yards. The problems are endless: ancient infrastructure is crumbling without the money to repair or replace it. Renewable energy strategies aren't materializing quickly enough. Rapidly growing urban centers are buckling under the weight of the commuting residents that occupy them. And all the while, the specter of global warming threatens to quite literally sink everything. In a perfect world, the DOT would be coming to the table with a slate of solutions — not problems — but it's not. Instead, it's calling Beyond Traffic ""an invitation to a conversation"" about how to fix things. ""Everyone uses our transportation system, which means anyone can help build its future,"" a slide deck highlighting the study reads. Here are some of the major takeaways. ""America's transportation system is a fossil in 2045,"" reads the slide deck. That's not wrong: even today, American bridges are regularly cited as being structurally deficient with no replacements in sight. It warns about the rise of new urban centers — ""Omaha is the new LA"" in the DOT's dystopian vision of the future — and rail systems so overcrowded that trains never actually stop to pick anyone up. No one can get to work. The study makes reference to several trends unique to younger people — a downturn in driving paired with a huge uptick in the acceptance of technology. ""Data enables innovative transportation options, such as car-sharing, ride-sharing, and pop-up bus services, and more rapid delivery of goods,"" the presentation notes. (Notably, Ford announced at CES this year that it's testing practically all of these things.) This might ultimately be terrible news for car lovers, but great news for the environment, infrastructure budgeting, and just about everything else. It's widely understood that the biggest hurdle to getting self-driving cars on the roads over the next couple decades won't be a technological one — it's regulatory. Lawmaking is almost always a bureaucratic nightmare, with special interests pulling strings and naysayers gumming up the works. For companies like Google and major automakers pursuing their own self-driving projects, though, this is probably good news: Beyond Traffic makes reference to the advent of driverless tech. ""Imagine eliminating 9 out of every 10 car crashes. That's the bright promise driverless technology holds over the next 30 years,"" the presentation reads. A three-decade time horizon probably isn't what Google has in mind, but at least they've got the Department of Transportation talking about it in a sharply positive light.  People like stuff, it turns out — and that stuff has to move around the globe. It's got to get built, get distributed, and get delivered. All of that takes energy and space on the road, the rail, and the water. Obviously, that's a particularly thorny problem to solve, because in a healthy economy, you still want stuff moving from producer to consumer. There aren't any good answers in the study, but part of the solution could simply come from more efficient routing of cargo traffic: there's the FAA's NextGen air traffic control, for instance, which the report calls out by name. It routes aircraft in and out of busy airports more efficiently. ""Imagine your plane never has to circle the airport again, because flights are perfectly timed and the skies are clear of congestion."" Radically increased storm frequency, rising sea levels, and higher average temperatures will all wreak havoc on nearly every aspect of the US' transportation infrastructure — a particularly telling graphic shows how New Orleans' Louis Armstrong airport will be several feet underwater by 2045, and even deeper by 2100. Ft. Lauderdale, San Francisco, Oakland, New York's LaGuardia, and a host of other major airline hubs aren't far behind. And for the USDOT, the worst part of all of this is that transportation systems are among the biggest contributors to the greenhouse gases that cause climate change. Tighter regulations on auto fuel economy help, but they probably don't go far enough. It'd be one thing if the money existed to solve all of these problems and government agencies just needed to figure out how and where to spend it. But it's actually much worse: Beyond Traffic notes that the government is spending less on infrastructure when adjusted to inflation, in part because the federal gas tax of 18.4 cents per gallon has remained constant over over 20 years. The study says that the trust fund tasked with repairing federal transportation infrastructure will have a shortfall of $12 billion for highway maintenance alone. All of this comes as 65 percent of American roads are graded as being in ""less than good condition,"" and 25 percent of bridges are in bad shape.",0.2870267118057151,0.712973288194285,0.2452851160173133,828,5.1714975845410631,490,6.1367346938775507,1,24,Transportation

The company added that a formal event for the project will occur in Pittsburgh the coming weeks. The center will focus on maps, safety, and autonomy Rumblings of the project were reported earlier today by TechCrunch. The move shouldn't come as too much of a surprise. Last May, Uber CEO Travis Kalanick said that self-driving cars were an inevitability for the company's business. ""The reason Uber could be expensive is because you're not just paying for the car — you're paying for the other dude in the car,"" he said during an interview at the Code Conference. ""When there's no other dude in the car, the cost of taking an Uber anywhere becomes cheaper than owning a vehicle. So the magic there is, you basically bring the cost below the cost of ownership for everybody, and then car ownership goes away."" While accurate, Kalanick's statement didn't exactly jibe with the company's line that drivers can get rich. It has fiercely attempted to recruit taxi drivers, as well as drivers for other car services with promises of earning more. Kalanick combated that by saying it would be a ""multi-decade"" transition. Drivers on @uber_nyc making $90k/yr Driverless car is a multi-decade transition. Let's take a breath and I'll see you in the year 2035  Uber is one of several companies racing to figure out a way to make driving autonomous.

All the while, inoffensive jams waft from your speakers. There's no narration or graphic overlay, because you wouldn't actually want to know anything about the car.  How do you sell a vanilla car with mint chocolate chip technology? The ad is indicative of a larger problem for Chevrolet: the Volt has to look and act like a normal, mass-market vehicle with vanilla styling and performance to match. Ergo, you end up with a vanilla ad like this one. But the car's high-tech underpinnings — the extended-range electric drivetrain that promises 50 miles on battery power alone — drive up the cost. So you have something that looks like a bit like a Honda Civic for many thousands of dollars more, paired with an ad that makes no attempt to explain the difference. GM has plenty of time between now and the Volt's on-sale date to explain why everyday drivers should shell out for one of these, but this sleep aid (like Samsung's for the Gear VR) isn't the campaign to do it.

But this is no ordinary furniture collection: it doesn't contain any ""core"" pieces like beds or sofas. Instead, it seems to be an amalgam of quirky accessories designed specifically to be cheap and consume minimal floor space. Other than showing many unrealistically happy individuals lugging large pieces of furniture around on the streets, the video provides only a glimpse into PS 2014; the ladder-like shelving unit with hooks at the top could prove useful in tiny kitchens or hallways, and the narrow bench meant for quick stops to put on or take off your shoes could turn an entryway into a makeshift mudroom. But then there are pieces — like a lamp that explodes into a Death Star-esque orb — that don't seem to serve any practical purpose other than simply being a conversation starter.   An exploding lamp, or an ultra-narrow bench? In the teaser's details, PS collection project manager Peter Klinkert emphasizes the importance of functionality and good design in places where people have little to spend and little space to spare.

Movies like Star Wars and Raiders of the Lost Ark were once the gold standard, artists like Drew Struzan capturing the essence of a film in a beautifully composed painting. That’s mostly been replaced by posters consisting of the bare essentials: the photographed faces of the actors the studio wants you to see, the branded title, and a release date.  But over the past 10 years, a small company in Austin has been fighting that trend, creating some of the most gorgeous original movie posters you’ve ever seen. Mondo is an offshoot of the Alamo Drafthouse Cinema, a chain of speciality movie theaters that cater primarily to film aficionados in places like Texas and New York. Back in 2004 Mondo mostly dealt in T-shirts, but Drafthouse head Tim League brought in artist Rob Jones — now one of Mondo’s art directors — to create a poster for Rolling Roadshow, the Drafthouse’s traveling film series. “That’s when I suggested, ‘You know what? I can probably get other guys to make posters for each movie rather than try to do just one poster for the entire event,’” Jones says. Mondo started to bring in more artists, produced more limited-run posters, and in 2012 relocated to a new gallery where it could show off the artwork in a more appropriate setting.   Last week that space was home to a show devoted entirely to Disney films, dubbed ""Nothing’s Impossible!"" Artists like Mike Mitchell and Olly Moss created alternative posters for everything from Alice in Wonderland to Wall-E, and like most Mondo shows it was an immediate success: fans lined up for blocks to buy the silk screen prints, with many posters selling out before they even had the chance to hit Mondo’s online store. This Friday, a new exhibit debuts, highlighting science fiction and fantasy work from popular Mondo artists Kevin Tong and Martin Ansin. With stunning posters for Psycho, Alien, and Flash Gordon amongst many others, the collection is a genre fan’s dream, and a reminder that posters can be much more than a mere promotional tool. Today Mondo averages a new gallery show about once every six weeks, and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences archives new Mondo posters for posterity. The styles range based on the artist, with Mondo posters consisting of everything from character portraits to surreal, abstract pieces. Whether it’s a new take on an old classic or a poster for an upcoming film, however, two thing are always the same: the art is inventive, and demand is rabid. Tong says they’re an important way for fans to express themselves — something that’s disappeared as we’ve shifted towards digital media. ""You used to be able to have a wall of CDs, and people would just come into your living room, and look at it and talk to you about music,"" he says. ""I think the same thing is happening for movies. Because what are you going to do, just sit there and say, ‘Would you like to look at my iTunes library?’""   Mondo’s brain trust — creative director Justin Ishmael, Jones, and fellow art director Mitch Putnam — decide which artists and movies are selected for new posters. ""Each one of us, under the umbrella of having good taste, has different interests and we like different styles of stuff,"" explains Ishmael. If one curator is obsessed with Italian horror films but doesn’t care about ‘80s action, Jones says somebody else on the team will bring those ideas to the table because of their own personal interests. And as both Ansin and Tong testify, the company gives the artists room to do the best work they can do, without creative interference. In the process, film fans of all types find something to like. Its creative and artistic edge helps Mondo’s posters stand out as true objects of art, a perception that’s only enhanced by their limited nature (some sold-out posters go for thousands of dollars on eBay). ""We don’t reprint posters at all,"" Jones explains. ""I came from the gig poster world, and in the gig poster world things have to be silk-screened to be taken seriously. So that’s why everything was silk-screened. And then two: you don’t reprint."" ""If it wasn’t limited, it wouldn’t be precious,"" he says. ""It wouldn’t be worth your time and care.""

Despite disrupting nature in the short term, the plan is actually a national research and conservation effort, and architect and engineering firm Samoo recently unveiled its winning designs for the project, the National Research Center for Endangered Species, to be built there. Most eye catching are the giant glass biodomes that will be build along the hillside. According to FastCo Exist, these closed-off ecosystems will be used to breed and raise endangered birds before releasing them back into the wild. The domes' looming height is apparently a necessity to allow the birds to adapt. Another group of buildings will reportedly focus on breeding and studying other endangered species, including certain fish, frogs, tortoises, foxes, and deer. Beyond that, World Architecture News reports that there will be two additional regions of the center. One will hold a visitor's center and administrative offices, and the other will have guesthouses for select visitors and researchers. The center will also allow for the study of rare plants. While a design this ambitious may seem like it could never leave the concept stage, there's good reason to believe Samoo will follow through: in collaboration with another design firm, it recently saw through the construction of another ambitious conservation project in South Korea — the snaking National Ecology Center.

Top speed of 73 miles per hour The new design makes use of three engines instead of two, and fly-by-wire flight controls that give it handling like a helicopter. The end result is a blimp that's 50 feet longer, carry a dozen people (compared to seven), and hit speeds of 73 miles per hour (up from 54), according to CNET.

As usual for these sorts of negotiations, both were quick to blame each other for causing the channels to go off air. Dish, in a press release, said that Fox ""blocked customer access ... as the media conglomerate introduced other channels into negotiations despite those channels not being included in the contract up for renewal."" It's not clear which channels, if any, Fox sought to bundle with the negotiations, but Fox Sports 1 and FXX are likely candidates. Dish was also quick to note that the company offered ""a short-term contract extension that would preserve the channels as the two parties continue to negotiate,"" but Fox apparently rejected that offer. Fox and Dish can't agree on basic facts Fox counters that narrative. In a statement, Tim Carry, a Fox News Channel vice president, said, ""It is disappointing that, after nearly two decades without a blackout, Fox News Channel has been blocked by Dish."" He continued, ""This is the third time in as many months that Dish customers have suffered through a blackout due to Dish's intransigence.

The BBC found that the factory, Pegatron in Shanghai, exhausted its workers with long shifts, didn't allow them to take time off, gave them cramped dorms to live in, and did not pay them for their time attending mandatory meetings. Apple is said to strongly disagree with the BBC's findings. It says that the dorm issue has been resolved and that suppliers are required to pay their employees for meetings.  ""We know our work is never done."" ""We are aware of no other company doing as much as Apple to ensure fair and safe working conditions,"" Apple tells the BBC. ""We work with suppliers to address shortfalls, and we see continuous and significant improvement, but we know our work is never done."" You can view the hour-long video component of the BBC's report, which includes undercover footage inside of Pegatron, over at its iPlayer website if you're within the UK. Apple's suppliers have been accused of maintaining poor working conditions on several occasions over the last few years, with its other Chinese supplier, Foxconn, being the center of attention. In response, Apple began working with Foxconn to make changes back in 2012, including setting up a number of worker protection standards for all of its suppliers. Apple publishes data on how well it finds those standards are being held to, but the BBC makes it sound like there are still significant issues for some workers at Pegatron. The BBC says that it found Pegatron violating Apple's standards for juvenile workers, though it does not elaborate on what those violations are. The BBC also found that Pegatron employees are being forced to work overtime, rather than having it presented as an option like it's supposed to be. One of its undercover reporters says that their longest shift was 16 hours. Another reporter says that they were required to work 18 days in a row. Apple tells the BBC that it montors more than 1 million Pegatron employees' working hours and that they average out to around 55 per week. The average in 2013, for employees working at least 40 hours each week, was a 54-hour week. ""Worker safety and well-being are our top priorities,"" Pegatron says in a statement to the BBC. ""We set very high standards, conduct rigorous training for managers and workers, and have external auditors regularly visiting our facilities to find areas for improvement."" Pegatron also says that it is investigating the BBC's claims and will take corrective action if necessary. In addition to investigating Apple's factory, the BBC also looked into one of its mineral suppliers in Indonesia. Apple says that it is ""driving responsible sourcing of minerals,"" but the BBC found that tin from illegal mines — including some with child workers and unsafe conditions — may be making their way into its supply chain. That's not an issue that's unique to Apple, however, and it can be seen as a difficult one to solve because of how many mines the material is ultimately sourced from. Apple stands by its decision to use suppliers that may not be totally ethical, saying that it can push for improvement that way. ""The simplest course of action would be for Apple to unilaterally refuse any tin from Indonesian mines. That would be easy for us to do and would certainly shield us from criticism,"" it tells the BBC. ""But that would also be the lazy and cowardly path, since it would do nothing to improve the situation. We have chosen to stay engaged and attempt to drive changes on the ground."" Apple's suppliers were previously said to have shown signs of progress in improving working conditions, but by no means has it been said that the situation is improved entirely. Labor watchdogs have been keeping a close eye on Apple and its suppliers because of continued reports of bad practices, and this investigation from the BBC is likely to stoke that even further.",0.41170319215878515,0.5882968078412149,0.8240225632102165,688,4.8735465116279073,352,5.8835227272727275,0,0,"Apple, Business, US & World"

CNN reports that top Sony executives received an email from the hacking group last night with a message saying that it would withhold further data, but only if the studio never let anyone see The Interview or pretty much any sign that The Interview ever existed.  ""Now we want you never let the movie released, distributed or leaked in any form."" ""It's very wise that you have made the decision to cancel the release of The Interview. It will be very useful for you,"" CNN reports the message as reading. The email concludes, ""We will ensure the security of your data unless you make additional trouble."" Unfortunately for Sony, that ""trouble"" includes a laundry list of perceived issues: ""Now we want you never let the movie released, distributed or leaked in any form of, for instance, DVD or piracy,"" the message reportedly says. It also says, ""And we want everything related to the movie, including its trailers, as well as its full version down from any website hosting them immediately."" That's both good and bad news for Sony. It is likely relieved that, for now, it has stopped the publication of damaging stolen data, such as executives' emails. But removing ""everything related to the movie"" from the internet is an impossible task. And even if the hackers don't follow through with their threat and continue to withhold the data because the film isn't being released, Sony will effectively be blackmailed into censoring itself indefinitely so that it can keep this data away from the public. The fact that giving into hacker demands is seemingly effective will also not please critics of Sony, who say that it was cowardly to have cancelled The Interview's release, even in spite of threatened attacks on moviegoers. US officials are expected to say later today that North Korea is behind the hack. It is unclear what response the United States will take, but the White House press secretary already began setting expectations yesterday, suggesting that whatever the US does will be ""proportional."" The press secretary said that the attackers may be looking for a specific response, and the US will be mindful of that in its reaction. Sony was hacked at the end of November. Over the past two weeks, the hackers have been releasing stolen data to the public, creating some huge issues for Sony that range from deeply embarrassing to highly damaging.

One of the features generated a temporary number that you could share on social media so anyone could reach you. They jokingly called it the Burner feature, an homage to the throwaway phones made famous by drug dealers on HBO’s The Wire. But they quickly realized that this feature was far and away the most popular part of their service, so they focused on that. They created an app called Burner that allows users to quickly and easily create new numbers, which they can use to send and receive calls and text messages, then destroy them at any time. ""It’s not a one time, one and done thing."" While the initial thesis was that people would want to create and quickly dispose of these numbers, over the last two years Burner’s internal data has told a very different story. ""It’s not a one time, one and done thing,"" says Cohn. Instead of drug dealers looking to hide their activity, many of their customers were lawyers, cops, teachers, and taxi drivers looking to create some separation between their personal and professional lives without the hassle or expense of having a second phone. Solving that problem has become a big business for Burner. Over the last year the startup has been among the top grossing apps in the utility category for for both Android and iOS, bringing in a solid six figures in monthly revenue and millions on an annual basis. Jeremy, a sheriff’s deputy in West Virginia, started using Burner to get around budget shortfalls. ""I currently work patrol division so I come in contact with different civilians every day,"" he explained. ""My department does not issue cellular phones to patrol deputies so I use the app to be able to give people a direct contact without compromising the privacy of my personal number."" The rise of the contract economy, with people renting their apartment on Airbnb and driving their personal car for Lyft or Uber, has also driven demand for a personal and professional phone number. ""Users are seeing the need for more than one phone number: one personal and one public,"" says Cohn. ""We see a lot of people who are using Burner as a substitute for carrying two devices, because it’s cheaper and more flexible."" ""A substitute for carrying two devices, because it’s cheaper and more flexible."" The idea of a software service that lets callers mask their identity isn’t new. Starting in 2005, web apps like Jangl and Jaxtr appeared, allowing consumers to exchange text messages and phone calls without sharing their real numbers. The best known attempt was probably Grand Central, which let users create a single number that rang multiple phones. It was eventually acquired and turned into Google Voice. But in an age of ubiquitous mobile internet and increasing privacy concerns, Burner feels like a service whose time has come. ""Most of the ‘version one virtual number companies’ were part of an era of web apps that were dying, right on the cusp of the mobile revolution,"" says Cohn. The Burner experience is quite different. Unlike the multistep process of creating a Gmail account and then a Google voice number, or logging onto a web app to augment a phone number, Burner users can create and delete new phone numbers almost instantly from within a mobile app. The company has a stockpile of unused numbers, which they can assign and activate to users on demand. Calls are routed through their servers and connect with the telephone network thanks to APIs from companies like Bandwith.com and Twilio. The explosion of mobile devices has also altered people’s needs. When Grand Central and Google Voice were formed, most people had a cell phone, work phone, and landline at home. The pain point was connecting all those phones to a single number. Today, many people have a single smartphone for those three uses. ""What people are trying to solve for now is, how can I have one device, but multiple numbers,"" argues Cohn. Multiple numbers, but a unified inbox Last month the company released a major update, Burner 3.0, adding photo messaging and bringing its design in line with the way its customers have actually been using it. Early version of Burner were built around making each new number an in-depth experience separate from all other numbers. ""What we realized was that people want multiple numbers, multiple ways to manage identity and privacy, but that they want to do it through a single, unified inbox,"" says Cohn.  The inspiration behind Burner was to make identity on your phone as flexible as it is on the web. ""With the internet, people have become accustomed to having multiple names, pseudonymous characters, and multiple points of contact they can distribute and eliminate as needed,"" says Cohn. ""But with phones most people are still stuck with this monolithic number they need to use for work, family, and recreation. It doesn’t make any sense."" ""To be honest, I was in an off-again-on-again relationship with a somewhat crazy girl."" Jeffrey, a teacher and self-professed gadget head, always looks for high tech solutions to his problems. ""To be honest, I was in an off-again-on-again relationship with a somewhat crazy girl,"" he explains. ""We decided we would keep in touch, but I didn’t really want her to have my personal line."" He considered buying two separate phones and checked out some wacky Japanese models with dual sim card slots. ""Then I came across Burner."" ""It worked really well,"" says Jeffrey. ""I actually started using it for other things, like giving my students a way to stay in touch without having to worry about them crank calling me or there being some idea of us having a personal relationship that was inappropriate."" Not everyone thinks Burner's approach makes sense Not everyone agrees that Burner’s approach makes sense. ""We did a ton of testing before launching Google Voice, and what we found is that most people don’t want the hassle of handling multiple numbers,"" says Grand Central founder Craig Walker. ""Imagine you create one number for your online dating and another for your students. Not something you want to mix up."" Walker says a more sensible approach would be to create a single Google Voice number and then simply screen your calls. ""You can set up your account to have some people ring you directly, some go straight to voicemail, and some get a message saying the number is no longer in service."" This requires, of course, that you know the inbound number, something which might not always be the case. If you’re making a spur of the moment decision to give your number to a stranger at a bar or a salesman you just met, creating a unique Burner number will let you know for sure who is calling. In a bit of aggressive marketing, Burner created this infographic, laying out exactly how complex it is to send a single picture message using Google Voice. Burner is available on iOS and Android, and comes with a free trial that lasts seven days, 20 minutes, or 60 messages. You can get unlimited voice minutes and texts in the area code of the user's choice for 8 credits, which costs from about $4 to $4.99, depending on whether you buy credits in bulk. If you want to pay as you go, the standard Burner is 30 days / 50 minutes / 150 texts for 5 credits.). In our testing, it took between 10 and 15 seconds to set up a new number. ""What consenting adults do with our service is not for me to judge."" While the app’s name conjures images of drug dealers trying to evade detection, Cohn feels confident they can build a trusted brand without changing. ""Certainly people always ask us about the potential for illicit uses. To the degree that someone might have an affair and use Burner, what consenting adults do with our service is not for me to judge. We think the majority of use cases are wholesome and in fact users protecting themselves and their privacy."" Anonymous and ephemeral chat apps have been garnering a lot of press and some massive valuations, while Burner has largely flown under the radar. Cohn, commenting on the hype surrounding services like Snapchat, YikYak, and Whisper, believes Burner fits into the same evolution. But while consumers have a bevy of options for messaging, however, almost all have just one number they regularly use. ""The phone number as most people know it today is fundamentally broken,"" says Cohn. ""It’s not smart enough, social enough, and it’s definitely not privacy-aware enough.""",0.6824955873712253,0.3175044126287747,0.8585872967533069,1484,4.8342318059299192,705,5.9730496453900708,0,0,"Business, Tech, Report"

Companies like Skycatch are currently developing drones that could act as automated guard dogs. When a motion detector is triggered, the drone would take flight and check out the scene, beaming back a live video feed so you can decide whether to follow up with a call to the police or even an onboard weapon.   The Supreme Court has ruled that citizens have no expectation of privacy when it comes to aerial filming — so for the time being, camera drones are fair game. It’s easy to imagine tabloids using them as propeller-powered paparazzi, tasked to follow a celebrity’s every move around town.   Things really get wild when you start to combine drones with virtual reality. Add an Oculus Rift to a quadcopter with an HDMI output and you can experience a drone’s-eye-view of a race over a raging river or inside an active volcano.",0.6818999358402402,0.3181000641597598,0.7401462747869241,206,4.6941747572815533,149,5.5436241610738257,1,6,"Business, The Big Future"

""We respect and understand our partners’ decision and, of course, completely share their paramount interest in the safety of employees and theater-goers.""  ""We stand by our filmmakers and their right to free expression."" The hackers who stole data from Sony threatened attacks on screenings of The Interview yesterday afternoon. In the time since, around half of all movie screens in the US declined to show the film. Sony's statement continues: ""Sony Pictures has been the victim of an unprecedented criminal assault against our employees, our customers, and our business. Those who attacked us stole our intellectual property, private emails, and sensitive and proprietary material, and sought to destroy our spirit and our morale – all apparently to thwart the release of a movie they did not like. We are deeply saddened at this brazen effort to suppress the distribution of a movie, and in the process do damage to our company, our employees, and the American public. We stand by our filmmakers and their right to free expression and are extremely disappointed by this outcome."" The decision is likely to account for a significant financial loss for Sony, which was in line to see a nice return on its Christmas-day comedy. Many are already criticizing the move by theater owners, worrying that this will set a precedent for how the film industry responds to threats. The theater owners stated that they felt this was a necessary decision to ensure their patrons' safety and comfort — and, in effect, they've also basically forced Sony's hand. That's a win for theaters, which may get to show this film at a later date, but it's not great news for Sony after all of the promotion it's done ahead of the 25th. The film, which stars Seth Rogen and James Franco, has raised some controversy because of its subject matter: an assassination attempt on North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, who is graphically killed at the end. North Korea is widely suspected to be behind the cyberattack on Sony, though it has denied any involvement. While not releasing the film at all would be a major financial hit, that does appear to be Sony's strategy, with Deadline reporting that a studio spokesperson has clarified that the studio ""has no further release plans for the film."" That means no DVD, Blu-ray, or online release — even though putting The Interview online is arguably the best strategy for the studio at this point.

For example, of the 77 percent of Americans who don't generally trust the federal government, only 38 percent said that opening up government data to the public would result in better decisions by officials. (For the 23 percent of Americans who do generally trust the government this figure was 71 percent.) These attitudes towards the benefits of open data also broadly follow individuals' political alignment. Democrats are more likely to believe that open data makes government officials more accountable (60 percent agreed) and helps journalists cover government activities (58 percent agreed), Republicans are less likely to think that open data helps how the government functions.   This is despite the fact that the survey found no significant differences between how frequently Republicans and Democrats actually use existing online government services. Fifty-six percent of Republicans said they had used any of six digital services listed by Pew (these included paying a fine or renewing a drivers' license online), while 54 percent of Democrats had done the same. Americans are unaware of links between government data and commercial apps The report also found that many citizens in the US are unaware of how government data can be integral to digital products like apps. For example, 84 percent of those surveyed had used weather apps on their smartphones and 81 percent had used maps — both of which rely on government data to function.

The small drone, reportedly some 50 centimeters long, was discovered on the roof on Wednesday morning at around 10:20AM local time. Abe himself is currently out of the country. According to The Guardian, the drone was carrying a small camera, a water bottle, and a flare. The Asahi Shimbun says the vehicle was also fitted with a small canister. Aerial footage from the scene appeared to show the device, first covered by a small piece of cardboard, before being obscured by a large blue tent erected by officials. Japan's NHK News says police analyzed the drone and detected extremely low levels of radiation, but that it would not be sufficient to affect the human body. A Japanese court today approved the restart of nuclear power plants It's not yet clear what the purpose of the drone was, but it appears likely, given the radiation symbol on its chassis, that the stunt was designed to protest Japan's restart of its nuclear power facilities. All 48 of the country's facilities are currently offline, having been slowly shut down in the wake of 2011's Fukushima disaster. Abe's government has pushed for them to be brought back online, but has faced opposition from citizens, thousands of whom have turned out to rally against the plans. Despite the protests, Japan appears to be close to restarting its nuclear power program.

There's a new flag, a national anthem, and a provisional government, although it's still not clear whether it's a real country, or how it might become one. It's all pretty confusing, so we've put together a quick guide to the story so far. What is Liberland? It's a new country, occupying 7 square kilometers of no man's land in southeastern Europe. There are no taxes and no governmental services. The country's president described Liberland as a country as a way to ""find out the minimum amount of taxes and regulation needed to live."" So this is a weird libertarian thing? Yes! The country has minimal-to-nonexistent government by necessity, but it's also planning to provision basic needs on an entirely voluntarist basis. They're already collecting donations to assist in the drafting of the constitution. (And yes, they accept bitcoin.) Any services or civic institutions — firefighters, banks, cell phone service — will be provided on a strictly volunteer basis. If you were going to sketch out a libertarian paradise, this is basically what it would look like.   Who's behind it? The founder and president of Liberland is a 31-year-old Czech politician named Vít Jedlička, who is also regional party leader of one of the Czech Republic's northern districts. He's part of the Free Citizens Party, a party with libertarian views. He has retained his Czech citizenship and seems to have remained in the Czech Republic throughout the historic founding of the world's newest nation. Is this a joke? Maybe! Jedlička has a history of outspoken anti-EU activism, so a lot of Europeans have assumed this is an unusually committed stunt. A simpler objection is that Liberland simply isn't a country — it's just a website that Jedlička made. At this point, it's very difficult to tell the difference. Earlier this week, Wikipedia had a vicious disagreement over whether the country merited its own page. (The page was built, but is currently flagged for deletion.) A group of Czech journalists visited the actual territory last week, but they couldn't get inside. The Liberland flag was raised over the territory after the founding, but the journalists reported it had since been taken down. Otherwise, the results were inconclusive.   Where did they get the land for this? Liberland is sandwiched between Serbia and Croatia, on the western bank of the Danube. The Serbo-Croatian border roughly follows the Danube, but certain territories have been disputed since Yugoslavia was first formed nearly 70 years ago, and it's left this particular patch of land in an uncertain position. It’s 7 square kilometers, which would make it the third-smallest nation in the world, after Vatican City and Monaco. The land is effectively under Croatian control, but Croatia doesn't claim it as part of the country — they're just holding it to use as leverage in an eventual treaty agreement. In 2000, a commission was set up to resolve the border dispute, but they haven't made much progress in the last 15 years. The result is a long-standing no man's land. It's not Serbia, and it's not Croatia. So now it's Liberland. So it's a real country? Not really. The Croatian border patrol still decides who can enter Liberland, and they've been turning away journalists who want to enter the country. The president and most of the current self-proclaimed citizens seem to be living in the Czech Republic. Thousands of others have already applying for citizenship (which you can do online), but it's not clear what that actually means. Since the country aims for minimal government, it's hard to tell if it's not doing anything because it's so libertarian or because it simply doesn't exist.  Is this the first time someone's made up a country? Not even close. The most similar case is Sealand, an abandoned oil platform off the coast of England that declared independence in 1967. It's never been formally recognized as a country, but it has its own flag, a soccer team, and a population of roughly two. Seasteading projects generally hinge entirely on the idea of made-up countries, although the ideas have rarely been put into practice. How do we tell if a country is real? It's surprisingly difficult. There's a question of whether other countries recognize it — particularly Croatia, since Liberlanders will have a hard time entering the country without Croatian permission. But that's just an issue of diplomacy, and it hasn't stopped Sealand from carrying on for decades. At the same time, America was once a made-up country, too. Maybe all countries are fake, and the only borders are the ones in our hearts. Having said that, Liberland pretty clearly doesn't pass the basic sovereignty test. It can't stop the Croatian Border Patrol (or any other paramilitary force) from doing whatever they want on its territory. So if it is a country, it's a failed state that's being occupied by a foreign nation. So how can I join? You can register for citizenship here, although there's currently a backlog of thousands.

His political opponents paint him as weak or weird, and he's been subjected to a barrage of unflattering headlines and articles in tabloid papers controlled by Rupert Murdoch.

Are they joking? It's hard to say — teenagers are better at irony than pretty much everyone, and this is doubly true for teenagers on social media. The digital media scene in the UK is fairly close-knit however, and more than a few definitely-not-teenagers have jumped on the bandwagon. However, the meme's unofficial spokesperson Abby seems to genuinely support of Miliband's Labour Party, and tweets as much praise about his political policies as she does fandom-themed messages. Teenagers are better at irony than everyone In an interview with The Guardian, she insisted that the whole thing is not ""tongue-in-cheek"" and that the meme is simply a result of young people's anger and frustration at the political situation in the UK. ""It is just young people angry that they can’t vote. [Conservative prime minister] David Cameron won’t give us a voice, so we are having our say anyway."" As a 17-year-old, Abby is too young to vote, although Miliband himself has stepped into the fray to thank her for her support.  @elliegalaxies same tho pic.twitter.com/scsSZwJZLN However, the whole political-fandom-meme looks close to being over just days after it began. This morning, the Conservative-supporting newspaper The Telegraph wrote up a supposed rival-fandom called the #cameronettes.

Its first trailer has famous faces, moving speeches, incredible outfits, and basically everything else you could ask for from a Hunger Games movie. It's a suitably epic look at the final film, which comes out on November 20th.   James Bond's next adventure is appropriately action packed... but also surprisingly calm? This trailer is actually kind of quiet and carefully paced. Sure, it's throwing in what I have to imagine is a shot from literally every action scene in the movie — cars, helicopters, explosions, gunshots, et cetera — but it all moves along at a pace that lets you see it unfold. And, more importantly, it gives some impression that Spectre will be about interesting people and events, and not just big explosions. It's scheduled for release on November 6th.   Pixar's second movie of the year is The Good Dinosaur, and it looks like it should be as charming of a film as we're used to seeing Pixar put out. That said, I have some initial reservations from this trailer, mostly related to the soaring, overly emotional Of Monsters and Men soundtrack. If this movie is really using the same careful, dialogue-free interactions as Wall-E, why not play those up rather than hiding it behind music? Presumably, we'll get a better look at that soon. The film comes out on November 25th.   This new trailer for Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials makes the film seem like one massive chase and escape sequence. That's probably at least somewhat accurate, given the series' conceit, but you may find the nonstop action a bit overwhelming. Clearly, this is going to be a lot more expansive than the first film. It's out September 18th.   I'm already sold. The Revenant is Alejandro González Iñárritu's followup to the brilliant and Oscar-winning Birdman, and it looks like his new film will be just as gorgeous and dreamy but in an entirely different way. It stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Tom Hardy in a story that's seemingly about surviving in brutally beautiful tundras. It's out on Christmas.   Of the crime anthologies to debut last year, Fargo certainly came up short when it came to grabbing the public's attention. But its first season was still a hit with critics, and its second season looks like it's on the right path. This first trailer has plenty of small-town charm and a 1970s energy that it seems to thrive off of. The show starts up again sometime in October.   I don't know, maybe this will actually be amazing. Jesse Eisenberg's constant sense of wonder at what he's capable of in American Ultra basically mirrors what we're all feeling, and that could make for some ridiculous comedy. Kristen Stewart seems to be doing just the same. It's out August 21st.   Perhaps this is the inevitable conclusion of our love for long takes: Victoria is supposed to be entirely shot in a single continuous take running over two hours long. It's a heist thriller, and really, who cares how good it is? You're kinda just going to watch it for the spectacle. It's supposed to come out in the US either later this summer or in early fall.   Peter Sarsgaard plays Stanley Milgram in this take on his infamous experiments on obedience. The trailer opens on his shock experiments, and even this fictional version is hard to watch. Sarsgaard plays his character as smooth and smug as ever — it looks like it should be a compelling watch. The film is out October 16th.   One of the most important and influential works in cinema history is returning to theaters after being restored in 2K. This new version of Man with a Movie Camera is supposed to be sourced from one of the only — if not the only — remaining full prints of the film, which has become famous for its innovative editing and frenetic portrayal of a city in motion. Screenings begin in the UK on July 31st.",0.7714815649986507,0.22851843500134927,0.15269879868645767,778,4.533419023136247,421,5.8479809976247035,0,0,"Culture, Entertainment, Film"

In less than two weeks, we’ve seen the release of Ernest Cline’s book Armada and the Adam Sandler movie Pixels, two different pieces of fiction with the same weirdly specific premise: aliens are here to kill us all, and only gamers obsessed with the 1980s can save us. Armada and Pixels are both stories for tribes, not readers or viewers. Their characters exist to string together references, their plots to affirm that a certain group’s shared cultural ephemera is actually a matter of life and death. Arriving after a year-long geek culture war that’s touched almost every fictional medium, both stories have been accused of embodying the dark side of that culture — slavish repetition, shameless pandering, and regressive politics. But they’re also two very distinct paths forward. And one, for all its flaws, could at least help kill the very worst trait of all: the persecution complex. As critic Laura Hudson noted in her review of Armada, geek love letters are ""designed entirely around getting the reference — high-fiving the readers who recognize its shoutouts while leaving everyone else trapped behind a nerd-culture velvet rope of catchphrases and codes."" The ultimate revenge for being ostracized is getting to ostracize someone else. This arguably describes Ernest Cline’s first novel Ready Player One, where ‘80s trivia is weaponized in a cutthroat worldwide competition. Its characters seem incapable of forming new ideas, constantly attempt to one-up each other with obscure knowledge, and are primarily interested in culture as a currency. Armada is like Ernest Cline knocking on your door to share the good news about Gary Gygax But it doesn’t quite capture the spirit of Armada. Armada is practically evangelical in its approach to nerd culture — Ernest Cline knocking on your door and asking if you’ve heard the good news about Gary Gygax. It’s arguably less compelling fiction because it tries so hard to be inclusive and explanatory. Almost every character is either a geek or a geek in training, and if geeks are united by the things they love, then every enemy is just one Star Wars reference away from being a friend. When the protagonist tells his Doctor Who-watching, Gandalf-quoting mother, ""All those years I spent playing video games weren’t wasted after all,"" he’s talking to a woman who already suggested he make or test video games for a living. You can’t play out a revenge of the nerds when everybody is on the same side. Even the over-the-top pop culture references can be redeemed. They’re so omnipresent that it’s almost like watching a new language develop. Intentionally or not, Cline hits on something fundamental: sci-fi and superheroes are becoming to us what the Bible or Greek myths were to past centuries. At a certain point, references stop being either special or exclusionary and turn into shorthand — like mentioning Icarus and Eve to invoke hubris and temptation. (This gets even more explicit when Cline’s characters start quoting the Bible alongside They Live.) Armada isn’t a coded message, it’s a phrasebook.   The problem with Pixels — a much more mainstream piece of culture — is that it demonstrates the opposite tendency. Its entire plot is a parade of ugly, nonsensical ego-stroking, based on the idea that ubiquitous trivia (like how to play Pac-Man) is actually rarefied and unique knowledge. Nerdiness isn’t a common language here, it’s the last status marker that underemployed middle-aged men can lay claim to. Pixels would fall apart if it allowed even a hint of Cline’s universality. If Adam Sandler’s character weren’t best friends with the president, if aliens weren’t mimicking a very specific set of games in versions that only he knows, if a conspiracy-minded friend didn’t randomly discover their message in the first place, he’d have to develop some redeeming quality beyond just showing up. For a movie whose characters spend a lot of time decrying snobbishness, it manages to be elitist at almost every turn. Pixels demonstrates why ""gatekeeping"" might not be the right word to describe people who consider geek culture their personal clubhouse. It implies that they’re trying to keep hold of something exclusive, instead of just pretending that their supposedly niche hobby isn’t already shared by almost everyone. As in Pixels, they’re forced to construct more and more arbitrarily restrictive rules: You make games, but they’re the wrong games. You write fantasy, but it’s pretentious fantasy. You learn every detail about a superhero, but it’s for cosplay, so it doesn’t count. Pixels' nostalgia isn't a common language, it's the last status marker of underemployed middle-aged men These rules are ultimately more regressive than the obsessive nostalgia of Armada. One of Hudson’s contentions about the book — that women don’t get much time in the spotlight — is technically accurate. But the book is still notably more progressive than any of the fiction it’s copying, from Ender’s Game to The Last Starfighter. Its love interest certainly falls into the ""scrappy girl geek"" trap, but it’s much easier to take when she’s one of multiple girl geeks. If the protagonist’s other female teammates are flat, they’re flat in almost the exact same way as the male ones. Armada’s references are so abstracted from their source material that they end up dropping a surprising amount of its nasty baggage. The broad paint-by-numbers writing of Pixels, by contrast, can’t support anybody stepping outside heavily gendered movie archetypes like ""creepy manchild,"" ""uptight professional woman,"" or ""Adam Sandler."" Maybe the most telling difference between the two is what gaming itself symbolizes. Pixels repeats, over and over, that arcade success is about following patterns; Sandler’s character is totally confused when enemies spawn randomly in a modern zombie game. To Armada’s protagonist, patterns are suspect. Anything too conveniently predictable, too much like a movie or a video game, must have something bigger going on. In theory, at least, Armada’s characters learn about tropes to subvert them — not to repeat them. It’s the difference between worshipping a piece of media and dissecting it, the difference between ripping off a story and building on one. It’s ironic that Armada can’t actually follow through with this premise, mostly settling for quotes and wish-fulfillment instead of ideas. And radical geek inclusivity has its own set of problems, particularly when it treats its culture as the only valid culture. But for something so backwards-looking, it at least gestures at a way forwards. If you have to pick, it’s better to think that everyone is like you than to base your identity on the idea that you stand alone.",0.3857653335751563,0.6142346664248437,0.1860046799967208,1117,5.2578334825425248,614,6.4234527687296419,0,2,"Culture, Entertainment, Editorial"

It isn’t subtle. The whole scene plays out as a meta discussion on Mission: Impossible itself, a 19-year-old, high-thrill film franchise (its roots as a TV series are moot at this point) that has long served as a tentpole for Tom Cruise: Action Hero. It’s a series that waits years between installments and purposely brings in a new director every time to add their own spin to a well-worn format (past helmers include Brian De Palma, John Woo, J.J. Abrams, and Brad Bird). Director and frequent Cruise collaborator Christopher McQuarrie (The Usual Suspects, Jack Reacher) has a lot of history to live up to, but more importantly, he also has to make Mission: Impossible exciting in a post-Avengers, post-Fast Five, post-Snowden world.  So Baldwin’s meta-question is very relevant: can Mission: Impossible stay relevant in this new era of popcorn film? The answer is decidedly maybe. Definitely maybe. Rogue Nation opens on Ethan Hunt (Cruise) tracking down The Syndicate, a group of evil agents (""the anti-IMF,"" as Simon Pegg puts it) that no one seems to believe exists, led by the anti-Hunt (a surprisingly beard-and-emotion-free Sean Harris). Why is The Syndicate so bad? Because we’re told they’re bad; aside from one (relatively) minor act of espionage, the movie fills in pieces with several lines of exposition. We’re supposed to hate them because of their ideals and capabilities — because Hunt hates them — not because of anything we really get to see. At the same time, the IMF is dissolved, leaving Hunt with few resources outside his own (admittedly impressive) arsenal of wits, safe house gadgetry, and obsessive sense of right and wrong. Mission: Impossible isn’t exactly known for taut storytelling, but the problem here is that there’s very little emotional investment offered for the audience. Of course, the throughline is just an excuse to tie together a series of action sequences, which for the most part shine brightly — chief among them is Cruise hanging off the side of a plane, which has been played up during the marketing campaign as this movie’s holy-shit-Tom-Cruise-actually-did-that moment. Unlike the time Cruise actually climbed the Burj Khalifa in Ghost Protocol, though, this scene doesn’t quite elicit the same visceral feelings as the tower climb. It's also much shorter — if you've seen any of the trailers, you’ve pretty much seen the whole scene. The other sequences are impressive, a mixed bag of the great (one prolonged scene at an opera house shines as the film’s best) and the maybe all too familiar (a pretty by-the-numbers car chase). That said, even the most rote sequence is exciting, thanks in large part to Cruise himself. Ethan Hunt is reckless and risk-taking; he rarely comes away from a fight without a few bruises, cuts, bullet wounds, or various near-death experiences. There’s an air of levity interspersed between the scuffles — a self-awareness that made Brad Bird’s entry (2011’s Ghost Protocol) so compelling — which carries over for the most part here. Cruise nails these moments, projecting at times both confidence and incredulity that he survived yet another precarious situation. Joining Cruise is computer whiz Benji Dunn (the always-talented Simon Pegg) and de facto femme fatale Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson), who is without question the best part of the film as a fully-realized, very capable, complicated foil to Hunt (note: not a love interest). The few remaining speaking roles — including older computer whiz Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames), secret agent project manager William Brandt (Jeremy Renner), and Alec Baldwin — are woefully underused but make the most of their screentime with wit instead of weaponry. Not that anyone else in this movie matters except Tom Cruise. Mission: Impossible is and has always been about Cruise wanting to push the limits of what an action star can do for the camera. But for all its style — and there is a lot of style, not to mention more than a little luck at some precarious moments — Rogue Nation feels lacking in substance. With Skyfall, Sam Mendes gave us a reason to care about James Bond, a flawed killer. The Fast & Furious franchise, which at this point is just pretty much a good vs. evil thriller with cars, has turned into the new high point for ridiculous stunts (some practical, some CG) and yet still manages to tug on our heartstrings every time Vin Diesel says the word ""family."" There’s no reason we can’t be blown away by big explosions and strong emotional choices, and Cruise is more than capable at delivering such a nuanced performance. Maybe next time. See you in four to six about two years, Ethan.

I'm Jamieson, I'm still your host, and I'm ready to spend this weekend floating in a kiddie pool. I can't believe July is almost over. This was a great week for new music, and I'm psyched to share all of these tracks with you. I hope you'll think about listening to this playlist while floating in your own kiddie pool (or real pool, or community pool, I don't want to make any assumptions about your pool situation). There's a Spotify playlist at the end for your listening convenience, and feel free to share your own favorite cuts /  compliments / complaints from this week in the comments. Let's go: The Chemical Brothers, ""Wide Open"": The Chemical Brothers are over 20 years into their career at this point, and they're still churning out vital, emotive electronic music with ease. That's quite an accomplishment given the genre's tendency to mutate. The Beck feature ""Wide Open"" closes Born in the Echoes, their first full-length in half a decade, and it's exactly the kind of song you'd expect given the veteran status of the artists involved: still propulsive, but rendered soft and reflective by time.     Empress Of, ""Kitty Kat"": I hadn't spent much time with the music of Lorely Rodriguez, the woman who records as Empress Of, before ""Kitty Kat"" knocked me on my butt. This is an intense piece of songwriting, dense with brutal, gritty synth blasts and a pleading, desperate vocal take from Rodriguez — and it's a far cry from the glittering chillwave she was making a few years ago. It's also the lead single from her debut album, Me, which is due for release September 11th. I'm keeping my ears out for that record after hearing this.     Future ft. Drake, ""Where Ya At"": Our own Micah Singleton reviewed Future's monstrous DS2 earlier this week, and this is my favorite song on it: no frills, no gurgled alien croaks or lovelorn hooting, no spikes protruding from the beat, just two skilled and charismatic rappers asking where the hell you were before they were famous. Have you forgotten? No new friends! I love when Drake hops on tracks and tries to mirror the parent artist's flow; it was entertaining on ""Versace,"" it was entertaining on ""My Way,"" it's entertaining here. (And yes, Drake is on this list every other week, I know — that's because he's one of the biggest stars in the world and worms his way into a disproportionate amount of good music. I will not apologize.)     Jason Isbell, ""Flagship"": It's time for something a little more sentimental. I love this cut from Isbell's fine new record Something More than Free, and I think of it as a cousin to a song I highlighted a few weeks ago, Kacey Musgraves' wonderful ""Late to the Party"": simple and sweet, drunk on love and companionship, committed to keeping a flame alive. Isbell is an incredible lyricist, spinning out small, gorgeous pieces of imagery and heartfelt bits of dialogue in equal measure.     Kurt Vile, ""Pretty Pimpin'"": The patron saint of rooftop barbecues and hammock naps has returned! Vile's new album b'lieve i'm goin down... is set for release on September 25th, and this is the first single. It's not much of a sonic departure for him — expect loping guitar lines, shambling percussion, lyrics drawled off the back of a napkin at your local diner — but it's more surreal than much of his earlier work. Vile wakes up and looks in the mirror, only to find a stranger staring back at him, and he has to keep yanking himself back into reality with routine tasks. When he catches the stranger-Vile wearing his clothes, he can't help but acknowledge he looks ""pretty pimpin'."" Just typing that plot summary made me feel more relaxed.     Ratatat, ""Abrasive"": This single from the new Magnifique is rich in melody and synth frippery, almost to the point of decadence — spending a few minutes with it feels like eating multiple desserts in one sitting. Ratatat is a Brooklyn band, but ""Abrasive"" feels like some lost B-side from Daft Punk's Alive 2007 or a track on a rare Justice EP. The mix of sounds, the playfulness, the generosity: it all scans as part of the French electronic school to me, which is a real compliment from this listener.     Rustie, ""Big Catzz"": A piece of behind-the-scenes insight for you: I was thinking about putting a different Chemical Brothers song on here, one called ""Just Bang,"" for the sole purpose of making a long and terrible joke about how sometimes you need a song that... just... bangs. And then I heard ""Big Catzz"" and realized I could express a similar sentiment in writing about this song, which is going to spit stompy, synthy hellfire out of your speakers as soon as you click play. For someone who thinks ""Slasherr"" is the high water mark of Rustie's career to date, this is catnip. Play this one loud.     Steve Hauschildt, ""Where All Is Fled"": Is it just me, or are there more major shifts between songs than usual in this week's column? We've veered from nihilistic, moody rap to lovestruck country and from relaxed, genial rock to gaudy electro-funk — let's change course once more. Steve Hauschildt used to be part of Emeralds, an American trio that made gorgeous, minimal ambient / electronic music. Working on his own since the band's split, he's released two strong LPs and a lengthy compilation, all of which look to the stars and the earth for inspiration. ""Where All Is Fled"" is the title track from his upcoming fifth full-length, and it's a nice introduction to his cosmic, contemplative work.     Wilco, ""Random Name Generator"": These alt-rock titans plopped their new album, Star Wars — and that's funnier than any dad joke any of us are ever going to make, so let's not even bother — on the internet last week without any notice whatsoever. I saw them play the whole thing live last Friday night in Chicago, and this song was a clear standout: a little glammy, caught between the band's jammier instincts and Jeff Tweedy's natural, nervous energy, packing teeth in those guitar leads. There's still plenty of life left in Wilco.     2 Chainz, ""Watch Out"": 2 Chainz has one of the best voices in rap, and here he's coasting over a beat that knows to stay out of his way. He's effortlessly stunting on ""Watch Out,"" rolling out quality punchlines faster than you can say ""incremental Chrome updates."" (The Verge is a tech site.) With that said, I would listen to 2 Chainz rapping a month's worth of detailed patch notes over this beat. There are some musical ideas that are pleasurable to their core, and this person on this kind of track is one of them.

We had fun discussing the topic, but we didn’t manage to come to any sort of consensus. There were songs we both liked that didn’t have the commercial firepower to capture the nation; there were songs that ruled the charts but left us both feeling flat. Neither of us left the exercise feeling like our thorough search had found us a real match. Perhaps we should’ve known better: a true Song of the Summer isn’t something you pick up scouring the charts or assessing a song’s merit. You feel it in your heart, and it slowly blooms within you. I’m here to tell you today that I’ve found my Song of the Summer, my sonic OTP for 2015. Say it with me, everyone: I’M A CLASSIC MAN.   You might have a few questions right now: Who is Jidenna? What is a ""classic man""? How can you become one? Why does this guy look like one of steampunk Sherlock Holmes’ sidekicks? Allow me to help. Jidenna is a rapper born in Wisconsin and raised in Nigeria. He’s signed to Janelle Monáe’s record label, Wondaland Records, and he’s only released two singles to date: the searing ""Long Live the Chief"" and the aforementioned ""Classic Man."" He also guests on Monáe’s playful, poppy ""Yoga,"" where you may have heard him first. (That song, and ""Classic Man,"" will be included on Wondaland’s collaborative EP The Eephus, which is due out August 14th.) He dresses like Jay Gatsby after one too many cocktails and serves face like a very dapper leprechaun, all of which makes him a very fun person to watch in a video or live setting. And he’s stumbled on a mixture of goofiness, elegance, and smart pop decision-making, a mixture that makes ""Classic Man"" one of the best things you’ll hear at a party or bar this summer.     The song has been around for a while; it was originally released in February, has been lurking on the Billboard charts since May, and was given a little boost by the release of the above Kendrick Lamar remix this month. People have been talking about it for a while, and it’s probably not going to make a sudden leap into the top 10 on the Hot 100 this late in its lifespan. Why bother bringing it up now? We all agreed ""Classic Man"" was both fun and dope I was in Chicago last weekend for a music festival, one I attend every summer to see a few bands and even more friends who live around the continent. There was plenty of great music on hand, and plenty of people interested in talking about it and enjoying it, and one song came to dominate the weekend: ""I’m a classic man!"" You heard it everywhere you went, from both speakers and the mouths of drunk festival attendees. I was hanging out in a bubble, sure, but in that bubble it felt like something we could all agree on: ""Classic Man"" was both fun and dope, and we should listen to it and make jokes about it as much as possible. If you want to dismiss this enthusiasm as the product of both inebriation and reaching critical music nerd mass, I totally get it — but give me a chance to convince you of the merit of ""Classic Man,"" both musical and otherwise. It goes down easy, and that’s because it’s familiar: ""Classic Man"" actually samples last year’s Song of the Summer, Iggy Azalea’s mind-numbing ""Fancy,"" for its fourth-gen Costco DJ Mustard sound. The beat isn’t compelling or groundbreaking, but it’s catchy, and we’ve all heard it before. That allows ""Classic Man"" to slide right into your ears — and before you know it, Jidenna is fitting you for a three-piece suit and pocket chain and telling you to put it on your credit card. Speaking of Jidenna, let’s talk about his vocals: he sounds a lot like a hitmaker of years gone by, one who was vying for his own Song of the Summer titles just a decade ago. Remember ""Smack That?"" What about ""I Wanna Love You?"" Akon and Jidenna both have a whiny, sharp tone to their voices, and an easy way with melody. It took me a while to place it, but everything clicked once I figured it out. Jidenna sounded instantly familiar because he was pulling from songs I loved hearing at high school dances a decade ago. Jidenna is a professor, a chess master, and a black belt in karate Beyond its sound, ""Classic Man"" has some specific qualities that render it appealing to almost everyone under the sun. It’s the silliest song of the year, and not just because of Jidenna’s face work: this is a song with a video where the protagonist saves a pair of youths from potential prosecution at the hands of the police through pure style and charm and teaches them a) chemistry b) chess and c) karate, all in the span of about 30 seconds. (And this is all intercut with scenes from the club, of course.) To be clear, if there’s anything off about Jidenna, it’s encapsulated by this sequence — the whole ""you can escape police brutality and systemic racism by dressing very well and acquiring skills"" thing plays into complicated ideas about respectability politics that don’t fall within the purview of this piece. (If you’re interested in reading more, this is a decent starting point, one with plenty of history with quotes from Jidenna himself.) And yet: watching Jidenna fashion himself a chemistry professor, grand master, and savvy hand-to-hand combatant faster than you can say ""elegant, old-fashioned man"" is objectively funny. Those are very hard skills to master, even for a classic man like him! Beyond that basic hilarity, my favorite thing about the song is its inclusivity. Here’s what I mean: if you listen to the chorus, Jidenna isn’t telling you he’s a classic man and you’re not. He’s proud of his status, sure, but he worked to get there — and he’s willing to offer you a helping hand if you want to do the same. ""You can be me when you look this clean,"" he says. Becoming a classic man doesn’t have anything to do with gender, or birthright, or how much money you have: it’s about the pursuit of an ideal. And if that ideal happens to be having an awesome time with all of your friends while listening to Jidenna, then you can be a classic man, too. Yes, you! If you’re still not interested in accepting ""Classic Man"" into your life as your sonic summer savior, that’s okay. (I appreciate you letting me make the case.) The most important thing I’ve learned from this protracted search for a Song of the Summer is that you can’t force a fit. It has to dawn on you one day like an epiphany; after that, it’s all gravy. This one is mine. I hope you find yours soon.",0.6559392683653106,0.3440607316346894,0.16665266119836783,1203,4.5619285120532007,611,5.7528641571194763,0,0,"Culture, Entertainment, Music"

Taylor Swift misread Nicki Minaj and tested the limits of Girl Squad Feminism in the process. Katy Perry snuck her paw in with a tweet people had a lot of trouble parsing. Just after that, Minaj beau Meek Mill accused Drake of using a ghostwriter and forced our Micah Singleton into a spiralling existential crisis. Everyone seems to be finding their chill as we roll into the weekend, but we're not finished with Drizzygate just yet: Quentin Miller, the rapper Meek named as the true lyrical force behind Drake's raps, has taken to Tumblr to dispute that claim. In a post published this afternoon, Miller wrote about his life before and after working with Drake. He says that Drake plucked him from a job at a bakery to work on If You're Reading This It's Too Late, his celebrated February mixtape. (Miller ended up being credited on five of the tape's tracks.) Miller also details watching Drake write and record the album. He specifically mentions watching him work on songs like ""6PM in New York"" and ""Madonna,"" both of which ended up included on the album.  Finally, Miller notes that calling someone a ""ghostwriter"" when they're credited in an album's liner notes doesn't make much sense. The concept of ghostwriting is grounded in someone not receiving credit for their work; if Miller had given Drake a bunch of verses for the album without receiving any mention in the packaging or credits, the accusation would make more sense. ""I am not and never will be a 'ghostwriter' for Drake.. I'm proud to say that we've collaborated.. but I could never take credit for anything other than the few songs we worked on together,"" writes Miller. Drake has mostly chosen to stay above the fray I suppose you could argue that Miller's doing this a) out of gratitude for Drake for jumpstarting his career and b) to preserve his relationship with the most popular rapper in the world, but this is a pretty strong move on his part, one I think exceeds mere glad-handing. Drake's been letting people comment on his behalf, choosing to stay above the fray excepting some Instagram DMs and likes. I wouldn't be surprised if he continued to stay quiet — until his next album comes out, of course.",0.48332196998406235,0.5166780300159377,0.8254625395072218,398,4.733668341708543,257,5.5330739299610894,0,0,"Culture, Entertainment, Music"

Even if you're not, you probably understand the trope I'm getting at — that the future of gaming is hyper-immersive virtual reality simulation. If you like war games, the ultimate goal is one where you're literally on the battlefield. If you're a role-playing game fan, you'd rather be exploring a real dungeon with your party. But this weekend, VR social network Altspace is launching a charmingly meta take on the genre: a virtual simulation of sitting around a table playing Dungeons & Dragons. Altspace, which opened to public beta testing earlier this year, invites obvious comparisons to Second Life. But unlike Second Life, it's built specifically for VR, and it's less about customizing an avatar than conveying simple body language. The result is a series of ""rooms"" in which stylized robots can stand around talking, playing chess on a sandbox-sized board, or watching TV together — the day I came to check out the Altspace tabletop room, somebody was streaming the Evo fighting game championships. The ideal Altspace setup seems to be a headset and multiple motion trackers, which let other people see your head and arm gestures, but it can also be played with a flat screen and a game controller or mouse. Once you get over the virtual reality elements, everything is pretty analog Technically, what I saw wasn't D&D but ""V20,"" an open-ended fantasy gaming setup in Altspace's new virtual tavern. To run a session, a game master builds a board out of pre-made tiles and monsters, and players pick virtual figurines that they can physically drag and drop around the map. Everyone rolls dice by tapping oversized polyhedrons that hover around eye level. Unlike some group role-playing games, V20 is relatively analog — game masters pick their own rule sets, and players fill out online character sheets that they can refer to using a built-in web browser. Other people can show up and watch, or they can switch to a new instance of the room to start another game. Altspace is celebrating the official opening of the tavern with two days' worth of VR gaming sessions, which are taking signups here.   Virtual reality social networks still aren't the easiest places to visit, especially if you have a subpar setup like mine. Between the Oculus development kit's blurriness and my Xbox controller's imprecise controls, moving a figurine became a calculated and daunting task, and that was before my finicky PC decided that it was done with all this VR business and crashed Altspace altogether. Few people are going to be able to take full advantage of the system, especially months before the launch of any high-end headset (Altspace isn't currently on Gear VR.) But it's interesting to see virtual reality gaming that's focused so specifically on social, instead of fictional, immersion. It's also not every day you see a version of tabletop role-playing that's even nerdier than larping. The only thing that might be nerdier still is a fusion of the two: apparently the first thing players ask is whether they can shrink into the map and play as their avatars during turns.",0.5732381692610444,0.42676183073895557,0.1842669408763515,561,4.953654188948307,341,5.8621700879765397,0,2,"Culture, Entertainment, Gaming"

But for most of 2015, the M3 has only been available in the UK, Japan, and Australia. While it seemed the camera would make its way to the United States eventually, now we know it will for sure: the Canon EOS M3 is will be sold in the US this fall. If you're unfamiliar with the M3, the mirrorless camera has a 24.2-megapixel APS-C sensor (the size found in most entry-level DSLRs), Wi-Fi and NFC connectivity, and 49-point hybrid phase-detection autofocus. It shoots 1080p video at 30 frames per second, and 720p video at 60 frames per second. There are video and menu controls on the back next to the tilting, 3-inch touchscreen, and three dials on the top of the camera let you cycle through the still shooting modes, shutter speed, and aperture. The M3 is only Canon's third mirrorless camera There's no built-in electronic viewfinder, so if you're looking to use one you'll have to buy the rather bulky option that Canon makes and attach it to the camera's hot shoe. The M3 also doesn't play nicely out of the box with Canon's deep well of EF and EF-S lenses — you have to buy an adapter to use any of those. In the meantime, you're left with just a handful of lenses to choose from in Canon's ""EF-M"" series, which the company created specifically for its mirrorless cameras. Canon is still a giant in the DLSR market, but it has fallen way behind the trend of the lighter, more compact mirrorless cameras. Companies like Olympus, Fujifilm, and Sony have spent the last few years debuting and refining some really great mirrorless cameras at relatively affordable price points, something photographers have jumped all over. The M3 may not change that, but at least Canon is finally in the game. The Canon EOS M3 will be available in black or white in early October. It will be sold alone for $679, with an EF-M 18-55mm kit lens for $799, or with a two lens kit (that same 18-55mm plus a telephoto EF-M 55-200mm) for $1,049.00. The availability is being announced alongside the introduction of Canon's newest lens, the EF 35mm f/1.4L II USM.

Announced last month, the Tab S2 is the first ""premium"" Android tablet we've seen in some time. And with a 4:3 screen ratio, this is Samsung's closest direct match for the iPad yet — at least in terms of design. The front in particular resembles Apple's tablet, mostly thanks to the chamfered edges. Around back the Tab S2 isn't nearly as much of a clone and feels pretty nice in the hand.  Despite a metal frame (the actual back has a soft-touch feel), it's also impressively thin and light compared to last year's model, measuring 5.6-millimeters (noticeably thinner than my Galaxy Note 5) and weighing 9.4 ounces (8.0-inch model) or 13.8 ounces (9.7-inch model). Samsung has sought to address one of the glaring issues of this tablet's predecessor: performance. The Tab S2 is powered by the same octa-core chipset that went into the Galaxy Note 4. And while that's not quite as powerful as what's inside the S6 and Note 5, the faster chip helped features like multi-window and split-screen zip along in our initial hands-on time. Last year, those often lagged or stuttered. So performance seems satisfactory. Samsung also says the Super AMOLED QXGA (2048 x 1536) display has been improved over the previous hardware, though wouldn't specify exactly how.  As for software, well, it's TouchWiz, and Samsung criminally hasn't (yet) brought over the theme store from its latest smartphones. Being able to mask the default icons and other user interface elements was enough to sway me into buying a Note 5, so it's a shame not to see it on tablets. The company told me themes may show up in the future, however. Samsung is also pushing its SideSync feature, which lets you mirror your Samsung phone on the tablet screen and use apps, send texts, or receive calls. And there's also tablet-to-TV (and vice versa) functionality built in, though you'll need a recent Samsung-branded TV to make the most of it.

Its unveiling may have been sudden, but the $200 router, called the OnHub, has actually been in the works for a couple years now. We've already laid out some of the features of the OnHub: it's configurable through an app; promises better signal throughout your house than your current router; and looks nice enough that you'll actually place it where you're supposed to place a router, prominently in the center of your house. All of which may or may not answer the question: why should I spend $200 on a Google router? Regardless of whether or not Google's feature list is enough to justify that price, you have to admit it looks better than most routers. We got a closer look at the router earlier today, and it's evident that it was designed with simplicity in mind. In short, this is not your ISP's router. Firstly, the whole set-up process is done through a dedicated OnHub mobile app (iOS or Android); SSID and password can be retrieved and/or shared with others at any point by simply tapping on ""reveal password."" The OnHub app also tells you how many devices are connected to the Wi-Fi at any given time, and how much data each device is using. Oh, and you can restart the router from the mobile app, which means no more crawling on the floor / moving entertainment consoles / throwing your back out to reboot a router. Since Google is hyperaware that people tend to believe the company knows everything they do on the internet, it says right inside the app's privacy settings that the router is not tracking the websites you visit. Speed tests can be conducted within the app, which will also give real-life examples of what types of internet activities are optimal, like ""You can stream Ultra HD video at this speed."" Maybe more interesting is what's inside the thing. There are 13 different antennas, including three pairs of 2.4Ghz frequency bands and three pairs of 5Ghz frequency bands. Each set of antennae is paired orthogonally, and are positioned 120 degrees apart, to get a solid signal even if your router isn't optimally oriented, Google says. And, that metallic-looking thing you see in the router shell below is a custom reflector for the front-facing 2.4Ghz router, meant to boost the usable range in that direction. There are also Bluetooth and ZigBee radios, although Google hasn't enabled those — yet. It will support Google Weave, the company's Internet of Things platform. There's also 4GB of internal storage, but Google didn't specify exactly what that storage might be used for beyond the basics of running the software on a smart router. Granted, the built-in speaker is only a 3-watt speaker, and it doesn’t have a microphone — so you won’t be able to bark Google Now questions at it. But you can see the potential for connecting other types of devices to it in the future. The exterior shell of the router is removable and, Google says, will be customizable in the future. (Right now, it comes in blue and black.) The OnHub goes on sale on August 31st. We'll have a full review soon, but in the meantime here's a peek at the innards of Google's router.

Sculley was forced out of the company in 1993 after a series of missteps, but he never left the world of tech. He helped found the company that became MetroPCS Wireless, which was later acquired by the parent of T-Mobile. More recently, he co-founded Misfit Wearables, which makes activity trackers, a sleep monitor, and a color-changing lightbulb.  Sculley’s latest venture is Obi Worldphone, a new mobile device manufacturer attempting to take advantage of the billion people expected to upgrade over the next three years from low-end ""starter"" smartphones to more full-featured models. Obi released five smartphones made with off-the-shelf parts in the United Arab Emirates last year as a kind of test, and the company says it has already climbed to 5 percent market share there. Tonight Obi is announcing its first two phones it designed itself: the SF1, a 4G/LTE phone with a 5-inch display that will sell for $199 unlocked, and the SJ1.5, a 3G phone that will sell for $129. Both will become available starting in October, with the goal of being in 50 markets by 2017. The phones were designed by Ammunition, the high-powered San Francisco design firm whose previous credits include the original designs for Beats headphones. Robert Brunner, a partner at Ammunition who previously collaborated with Sculley on devices including Apple’s PowerBook and Newton PDA, led the effort.  Sculley says Obi will distinguish itself from competitors with eye-catching design details and better components than its target customers are used to. ""Our differentiation is no-compromise, beautiful design,"" says Sculley, 76, who greeted me in an Ammunition conference room this week along with Diane, his wife of two and a half years, and their dog, Cinnamon. ""What is unique about Obi Worldphones is the role that Robert and his team play. We said, the only way we’ll go into this business is if we’re convinced we can build products with no compromise. They have to not just look cool, but be perfect in terms of fit and finish."" The result is a pair of phones whose most distinctive feature is their slightly raised 5-inch screens — Ammunition’s Robert Brunner calls it ""extruded"" — that offer a bit of protection from drops, the company says. The flagship SF1 has a 1080 x 1920 pixel display; the less expensive SJ1.5 is 720 x 1280. The SJ1.5 has the more striking form of the two: the device is flat on top but round at the bottom, to make it easier for holding. All of this is subtle stuff — at a distance of more than a few feet, either phone is all but indistinguishable from any number of Android smartphones. Sculley says the design makes no compromises despite its low price. And there’s a lot to like here. The SF1 features a Qualcomm Snapdragon 615 processor, 2GB or 3GB of RAM, and 16 or 32 GB of internal storage, expandable up to an additional 64GB with a micro SD card. (The higher-end model costs $249.) The back-facing camera has a 13-megapixel camera with automatic focus, powered by Sony’s IMX214 Exmor sensor, and allows for geotagging, touch focus, face and smile detection, panoramas, and 1080p video at 30 fps. The front camera has a 5-megapixel camera and LED flash. The SF1 also features Dolby Audio with 7.1 channels of high-fidelity sound, along with dual microphones for noise cancellation. The battery is a more than respectable 3,000 milliamps. Both phones run a slightly modified version of Android Lollipop the company calls Lifespeed. At this point, there’s not much to Lifespeed — it’s essentially a custom lock screen with some original background wallpaper. But it will evolve over time, Obi says. So will it work? Obi isn’t the only company coming for the low-end smartphone market. OnePlus has seen significant interest for its first two efforts. Huawei has been on a tear lately. And the Obi team has closely watched the success of Xiaomi, the Chinese electronics company that started by selling low-end smartphones at cost and turned it into a platform for selling higher-margin accessories and services. (It also apparently does a mean business selling costumed bunnies.) Obi believes there’s room for others to play. He’s seen it before. ""Everyone thinks the industry is crowded, no one can make money,"" he says. ""All of a sudden someone comes in"" — and changes the game in their favor. Sculley says he and his partners have a strong background in device manufacturing and supply chain management through some of their previous businesses, notably Misift. Xiaomi’s strategy has been to sell its products via flash sales that create buzz around the devices when, inevitably, they sell out. Obi plans to bring the SF1 and SJ1.5 via a more traditional route, selling them via a mix of retail and online stores. Will it work? I have no idea. On one hand, there’s clearly a large appetite for low-cost smartphones in developing markets, and millions of people are going to make that switch in coming years. On the other hand, making commodity smartphones is a brutal business that has brought giants to their knees. Apple still earns a ludicrous 92 percent of all profits in the smartphone business, and Android-based rivals have struggled to make inroads. HTC, to name but one, has watched its market share slip from 10 percent in 2011 to less 2 percent today. But older players often find themselves in a more difficult position than the young and nimble. ""It would be a lot harder if you asked me to fix HTC. I wouldn’t have a clue!"" Sculley says, his eyes twinkling. ""But if you look at a clean sheet of paper — it’s amazing how interesting it can be.""",0.5115155761879338,0.48848442381206625,0.841554848954848,990,4.9101010101010099,552,6.0887681159420293,0,3,"Mobile, Tech, Report"

Investigating the veracity of that cliched phrase was done in the humorous spirit of April Fools' Day, but the data and findings are no spoofs. Studying the eating habits of 8,399 Americans, the researchers separated out a group of 753 who ate at least one small apple every day. These apple eaters were generally healthier and better educated than the general populace, but once the effects of such confounding factors were accounted for, there was no statistical difference to be found. Apple eaters were just as likely to visit the doctor or have an overnight hospital stay as everyone else.  On the plus side, eating apples seems to be helping people cut down prescription meds This analysis, led by University of Michigan assistant professor Matthew Davis, has a number of important limitations. While its subjects are nationally representative for the US, the data is based on their recall of food consumption over a period of 24 hours, which they assert to be representative of their usual diet. That's then compared against their hospital or doctor visits over the previous month, which are again self-reported, and the metric for ""keeping the doctor away"" is to have no more than one meeting with a medical professional during that period. That leaves the nuance of why people might need treatment unaddressed. There is, nonetheless, some good news for the dedicated apple devourers in the study.

A boot-like exoskeleton that fits into a regular running shoe reduces the energetic costs of walking by about 7 percent. In short, it makes walking less tiring without resorting to a battery pack or a motor — something that could really come in handy for people who have trouble walking, or military personnel in remote areas. They improved human walking — without a power source ""Our study shows that walking, a highly evolved human task, can be improved by manmade technology and engineering,"" says Gregory Sawicki, a co-author of the study and a physiologist at North Carolina State University. ""That’s what’s so exciting for us."" A 7 percent reduction in the energy cost of walking isn’t entirely new: researchers have achieved similar gains in the past. In 2013, a group of researchers achieved a 6 percent reduction in energy costs thanks to an air compression system. Others have worked on exoskeletons that are powered by motors and battery packs. But the device that Sawicki and his team came up with doesn’t need any of that; it's unpowered. It makes walking less tiring by rerouting the energy that normally goes through your calf muscles and tendons into carbon fibre, metal — and a very basic spring.    ""It’s sort of been a grand challenge in the field,"" Sawicki says. ""All the way back to graduate school, we had our eyes on this — and whether or not this was even possible."" ""It’s sort of been a grand challenge in the field.""  Unlike most muscles, the calf muscle doesn’t ""turn on"" by shortening itself and contracting. Instead, is provides a rigid link upon which the Achilles tendon can stretch and recoil. This is what the exoskeleton is replicating thanks to a system of springs and clutches. When the heel strikes the ground — a time when the Achilles tendon would normally hold onto the calf muscle with a high force — the clutch holds on to the spring of the exoskeleton. ""From that point on, the forward momentum of your body is exchanged with the stretch of the spring; the spring kind of catches your forward movements,"" Sawicki says. This means that when the spring stretches, some of the energy of the human body is transferred into it.   Collins, et al (2015)  The device is also super light weight. That means that the there’s no significant mass penalty that needs to be factored into the energy gains you get from wearing the exoskeleton on both legs. ""The device weighs between 300 and 500 grams, which is a little heavier than your really lightweight running shoes,"" Sawicki says. ""It’s about the weight of a normal dress loafer."" ""The reported savings are impressive,"" says Heike Vallery, a biomechanical engineer at the Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands who didn't take part in the study. Art Kuo, a University of Michigan biomechanical engineer, also thinks that the findings are sound, but cautions that this is only a first step — medical applications are still far away, he says. Others wonder how the device will fair with everyday use. ""It isn't clear how the device would respond to non-rhythmical cyclic tasks,"" says Daniel Ferris, a biomedical engineer, also at the University of Michigan. Energy savings might not occur during tasks like standing, turning maneuvers, sit-to-stand and stand-to-sit motions. Still, Ferris thinks that the exoskeleton could prove useful for people who have reduced ankle strength — people with incomplete spinal cord injuries, the elderly, and people who suffer from multiple sclerosis, for instance. Using the boot isn’t very hard, Sawicki says. ""After 20 minutes or so, most people aren’t conscious of it; it gets integrated into their being."" The only time users notice it is when they take it off. ""There’s this heavy leg feeling after, that lasts for up to five minutes for some people,"" he says. ""You feel like your leg is collapsing under you."" When you take it off, ""you feel like your leg is collapsing under you."" This hints at something that researchers will undoubtedly have to investigate: what are the effects of wearing the exoskeleton for long periods of time, on a regular basis? Given what happens when people spend a lot of time in wheelchairs, it’s possible that a user's leg muscles would become weak with extended use. ""My instinct is to say that if you wore it all the time, the body would recognize the parallel pathway, and the morphology of your leg would change,"" Sawicki says. But ""we just don’t know yet."" It took over five years to come up with this design. And the fact that they were able to do this at all has a lot to do with advancements in medical imaging techniques. ""That whole 'clutch-holding and Achilles-stretching' thing — we didn’t know about that until the late 2000s, when people were started using ultrasound imaging to look at what muscles were doing,"" Sawicki says. Thanks to these techniques, researchers were able to see that the calf muscle and the Achilles tendon were acting like the clutch and spring in the exoskeleton. ""It changed the way we look at exoskeletons.""  There’s a lot that the exoskeleton can’t do right now; it really only works at certain speeds. ""The device in the paper will break during running,"" Sawicki says. The researchers still have to find a way to make a sturdier (and bulkier) device that can withstand harder impacts. Different materials, like electroactive polymers, might help them do that. ""We need to build a device that can do it all."" Still, if all you want to do is go for a walk, the exoskeleton can help. People who like to go hiking might want to wear it, Sawicki says. The exoskeleton might also prove useful for military personnel. But what the team is really interested in are the medical applications. ""It could be a mobility aid for people who have had a stroke,"" Sawicki says. Given the regulations surrounding medical devices, the exoskeleton might end up making it to market as a recreational device first, however. Sawicki thinks that the final product would cost a little under $1,000. ""Even if we could build Ironman, how practical would it be for regular use?"" But before the researchers can think of marketing the exoskeleton to hikers, Sawicki and his team will have to come up with a name. They’re open to suggestions, he told The Verge. You might want to stay away from superhero references, however. ""I love science fiction and stuff — I think it has provided a lot of motivation for our field — but it’s so far removed from where we are in the field in terms of capability,"" Sawicki says. Moreover, making a superhero suit doesn't align very well with what the researchers are trying to achieve. ""Even if we could build Ironman, how practical would it be for regular use? People wouldn’t be able to afford it. We want to make things that are simple and accessible to a large amount of people.""",0.513850550406821,0.48614944959317896,0.516443985983405,1210,4.8371900826446277,554,6.0649819494584838,0,2,"Science, Tech, Report"

Mars is what NASA calls a tricky ""in-between"" environment: unlike the Moon, its atmosphere is too thick to land with rockets alone, but it's too thin for even a huge parachute to gain much traction. Its missions so far have used a combination of the two, along with other means of slowing a lander. But the larger and more ambitious the craft, the more difficult this becomes. To address this problem, NASA is trying to develop alternatives with the Low-Density Supersonic Decelerator (LDSD) program, and it's looking at what is basically a high-tech combination of a balloon and a flying saucer. The saucer, which will come in 6-meter and 8-meter versions, creates huge amounts of drag with an inflatable donut, slowing a payload down enough for a 30.5-meter parachute to take over. The system was tested over Hawaii last summer — NASA even put up a video of the craft falling from near-space. It's going back for another test flight in June, but at 2:30PM ET, you can watch NASA give it a preliminary test and answer questions about the mission.   This afternoon, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California will be putting the saucer on a spin table to make sure it's balanced properly for flight. LDSD team members will also be around to answer questions submitted by viewers. There's more information about the craft on the project home page, including a fact sheet and a gallery of photos from its last outing. If everything goes right, we could see the drag system in action on Mars by 2020.

In a submission to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, the United States says that it will use executive actions, largely under the Clean Air Act, to cut carbon pollution from new and existing power plants, improve fuel economy standards, and limit methane emissions from landfills and the oil and gas sectors. The submission comes ahead of a UN climate conference in Paris meant to coordinate a global response to climate change and prevent the Earth from warming more than 2 degrees Celsius, a widely accepted target for limiting the effects of warming.     ""We have the tools we need to reach it."" ""The United States’ target is ambitious and achievable, and we have the tools we need to reach it,"" Brian Deese, a senior advisor to President Obama, writes in a blog post. ""The goal will roughly double the pace at which we’re reducing carbon pollution through cost-effective measures using laws already on the books."" The United States' emissions targets are based on 2005 measurements. The US says that it's already on target to reduce emissions 17 percent by 2020. Reaching 28 percent by 2025, it says, will require a ""substantial acceleration"" of the current pace of reductions. The US says that it's going to ""make best efforts"" to reach the 28 percent goal — it is otherwise committed to reaching at least a 26 percent reduction. The Obama administration wants to have new carbon limits on power plants by this summer and new fuel emissions standards for heavy-duty vehicles after 2018. Another contribution to this plan came last week, when the administration mandated that federal government operations reduce emissions 40 percent by 2025 — they have already been reduced by 17 percent.   The administration intends to implement these changes in ways that will not be easy for Republicans to later reverse, should they take control of the White House. ""The undoing of the kind of regulations that we are putting in place is something that is very tough to do,"" says Todd Stern, a State Department climate change representative, according to The Guardian. ""The kind of regulation we are putting in place does not get easily undone."" Naturally, these changes are being made through executive action, since the Republican-controlled Congress is highly unlikely to pass legislation meant to combat climate change. The New York Times reports that Secretary of State John Kerry is going so far as to make sure that the Paris agreement does not qualify as a treaty, which would require ratification in the Senate. Republicans are, unsurprisingly, opposed to the plan, calling it potentially illegal and likely to kill jobs. Immediate action on climate change has become critical. Over the past two years, UN scientists have issued a series of devastating reports basically saying that the world will be in very bad shape if dramatic greenhouse gas reductions are not made immediately. One report warned of severe food shortages. Another report said that potentially irreversible damage would be felt globally, hurting infrastructure and economies. Basically: meaningful action is incredibly important. Most countries involved in the UN agreement have not yet submitted outlines, despite an end-of-March deadline. The administration is still touting its success, however, noting that countries representing 58 percent of global carbon emissions have announced their post-2020 reduction goals. Notably, that includes China, which plans to reach peak carbon emission levels by 2030. The Times reports that other countries may deliver their plans in June, if not later. Specifics of the climate change agreement will be made in Paris this December.",0.5087693604929632,0.4912306395070368,0.8395716944507661,619,5.1486268174474956,338,6.2603550295857993,1,2,"Policy & Law, Science, US & World"

And geopolitics Astronauts leave nothing to chance, and alongside the checks and double-checks carried out before a rocket launches, there's a clutch of rituals that have taken root in the world of space travel. Perhaps the oddest of these (at least visually) is the official blessing dished out by a priest from the Russian Orthodox Church. American astronauts, Russian cosmonauts, and even rockets all go through this, with photos from NASA's official photographer showing that the same bearded and gowned official has been carrying out the ritual with gusto for a few years now.   He clearly gets a kick out of it.   For the cosmonauts it's a bit of a scrub-up before space.   And even the photographers get in on the action: ""You get a blessing, and you get a blessing, and you get a blessing!""   Now, it's not quite clear when this particular tradition began. It certainly wouldn't have taken place under the officially atheist Soviet state, but Russians have embraced religion in recent years (not least of all thanks to Vladimir Putin, who benefits from the support of the Moscow Patriarchate), and it seems at some point, the Church got invited to the space party. It may seem a little at odds with the whole science-and-logic scene, but it's better safe than sorry, right? Some patriotic Americans might object to the practice but for the US, there's not much choice. Ever since the Space Shuttle was retired in 2011, NASA has relied upon Russia's Soyuz rockets and its Baikonur Cosmodrome to transport men and women up to the International Space Station — and a bit of holy water is a small price to pay. Other space rituals include planting trees and (possibly) urinating on a tire And blessings are far from the only ritual to take place at Baikonur. After all, this is the place that launched both the first artificial satellite (Sputnik 1) and the first human to travel to outer space (Yuri Gagarin). As well as getting a visit from a priest, cosmonauts and astronauts contribute to an avenue of trees planted before each mission, and watch the same pre-flight movie before takeoff (a cult Russian ""Western"" from 1969). The Russian cosmonauts also reportedly urinate on the back right-hand wheel of the bus that takes them to the launch pad — a tradition started by Gagarin himself before his first flight. Thankfully, this (possibly apocryphal) ritual is less well documented than the blessings.",0.6205012888619572,0.3794987111380428,0.8879813454454144,417,4.8345323741007196,254,5.8661417322834648,1,8,

The goal is to prevent the proliferation of aggressive bacteria responsible for 23,000 deaths and 2 million illnesses every year, the Associated Press reports. The five-year plan is a response to the country's growing reliance on antibiotics for medicinal purposes and in the food industry. It outlines several goals, which include slowing the emergence of superbugs, strengthening surveillance and tracking efforts of such germs, accelerating scientific research, and improving international collaboration and communication. Eliminate serious threats by 2020 ""Studies have consistently shown that a lot of America's antibiotic use is unnecessary,"" President Obama said in an interview with WebMD. ""If we can see where these drugs are being over-prescribed, we can target our interventions where they're needed most."" Critics of the plan say it doesn't do enough to challenge the use of antibiotics in livestock, The Washington Post reports. In 2013, the FDA created guidelines for farms aiming to phase out the use of certain antibiotics in food production, but the guidelines were suggestions rather than rules. The plan announced today says the FDA and USDA will create ""educational outreach materials"" and test and validate ""alternatives to traditional uses of antibiotics in agriculture."" The requested budget for the plan is $1.2 billion — nearly double the current federal budget dedicated to fighting superbugs, the AP reports. The Obama administration expressed concern that, if nothing is done, these strains of bacteria could eventually render life-saving antibiotics useless.

In 2011, Europe began halting shipments of lethal injection drugs to the US, and states — which have now seen a series of botched executions — have turned to domestic pharmacists to make up the difference. But there may be a hitch in that plan, as a leading pharmacists association is now discouraging its members from providing drugs used in executions. The pharmacists' decision places the association on the side of the American Medical Association, which, like other medical groups, discourages physicians from participating in executions. The International Academy of Compounding Pharmacists took on a similar policy last week. States have been taking extreme measures in an attempt to make up for the drugs.

The German auto giants are working with ChargePoint, which already operates a network of card-operated chargers that can be installed by companies and individuals on their premises. Construction is already way, starting in San Diego. What makes the announcement significant is that these units are a cut above the 240-volt Level 2 chargers found scattered throughout the country: they use 500-volt DC Fast Charge, which are capable of recharging both the BMW i3 and the Volkswagen e-Golf to 80 percent in 20 minutes. That compares to 40 minutes to reach 80 percent in an 85 kWh Model S using Tesla's proprietary Supercharger network, though the battery capacity of the Model S is significantly larger: on a dual-motor 85D model, that would work out to around 216 miles of range. By contrast, neither the i3 nor the e-Golf will reach 90 miles on a completely full charge.  Too bad there's a standards war This isn't the first time BMW has put up a challenge to the Supercharger: it announced a partnership with eVgo last year to deploy at least 100 fast chargers throughout 2015 in California. It'd be nice if there was a single standard that everyone was using to charge electric vehicles quickly, but we're currently mired in a standards battle that has Tesla competing with CHAdeMO — most notably used by the Nissan Leaf — and SAE CCS, which is the standard in use by BMW and Volkswagen, among others. Some adapters exist to allow certain cars to charge on different networks, but it's scattershot; Tesla, for instance, has been promising a CHAdeMO adapter for a while. On the east coast, the new network will run from Boston to Washington, DC. On the West Coast, they'll run from Portland to San Diego. In both cases, there'll be no gaps greater than 50 miles, allowing EVs with relatively low range (like the i3 and e-Golf) to make it from station to station and take a 20-minute charge before continuing on.",0.3329359178508411,0.6670640821491589,0.5820523349983154,363,4.8126721763085403,232,5.6681034482758621,0,0,Transportation

On January 20th, I witnessed my very first rocket launch — an Atlas V rocket punching into space to drop a communications satellite for the US Navy into orbit 22,000 miles above Earth. That required about 2.5 million pounds of thrust: a very large explosion that must be precisely controlled in order to be successful. It’s not as ambitious as the things that are coming next, but I found it awe-inspiring all the same. For the last several years, the space program has been in a bit of a lull. The last time NASA sent humans beyond low-Earth orbit was the Apollo program in the 1970s. Since then, the US space agency has focused on sending people to the International Space Station and probes beyond. Actually, the US hasn’t ferried its own astronauts to the ISS since 2011; we’ve hitched rides with Russian cosmonauts aboard the Soyuz. But last April, NASA announced it would begin launching US astronauts itself starting in 2017, and it awarded contracts to Boeing and SpaceX to do just that.   NASA itself is looking more ambitious since the test launch of Orion, an Apollo look-alike designed to carry humans beyond the ISS — perhaps even as far as Mars. In fact, the agency’s goal is to get to Mars in the 2030s. The agency has been working with new technology, including Microsoft’s Windows Holographic and helicopter drones for Mars; recently, NASA began 3-D printing objects in space. Recently, the agency suggested sending humans to airships floating in Venus’ atmosphere. Obviously, more than a few people are dreaming big. And it’s not just dreams, either. NASA’s budget rose by 2 percent to $18 billion this year — more than the agency asked for. Almost $3 billion has been allocated to support NASA’s human spaceflight endeavors. It’s not all rosy. Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) is overseeing the Senate subcommittee on Space, Science, and Communication. He doesn’t believe in human-caused climate change, which could potentially jeopardize some of NASA’s environmental research. But space is important to his constituency. Private companies including Boeing and SpaceX have operations in Texas, and NASA’s Johnson Space Center is located in Houston. Even if NASA’s missions face an uphill battle, more countries than ever are participating in space programs; ESA’s nail-biter of a landing on a comet last year suggested that NASA isn’t alone in its audacious goals. Meanwhile, SpaceX, the Sierra Nevada Corporation, Orbital Sciences, Virgin Galactic, and a handful of others have announced their own ambitions for commercial spaceflight. In other words: Space exploration is back in a very big way.   The biggest explosion I've seen in person   At first, I was worried the Atlas rocket wouldn't launch at all — wind and interference created delays. But then, a little after 8PM, the hold ended. I was almost queasy from excitement. I wasn't ready for how bright the Atlas launch would be. For a few moments, it was daylight again — even though I was four miles away from the rocket. After the light came the roar: not deafening, but loud. That launch was probably the biggest explosion I've ever seen in person,  and it was definitely cooler than the ones I've seen in the movies. I watched the sky until the bright dot faded from view. One thing was very clear to me: I need to go to more rocket launches, because I definitely want to see that again. I'm a simple woman. Huge, planned explosions make me very happy. Space is difficult. That’s exactly why I think it’s exciting. It was astonishing to watch the Atlas rocket leave Earth. I can hardly wait to see what will happen next.",0.6464828682551154,0.35351713174488464,0.48426044107042826,626,4.9025559105431311,367,5.961852861035422,0,12,"Science, Transportation, US & World, Report, Videos"

As The New York Times reports, Mad Men creator Matthew Weiner enlisted the help of acclaimed 84-year-old graphic designer Milton Glaser (the creator of the ""I ♥ NY"" logo and a co-founder of New York Magazine) to channel the season's late 1960s setting. Weiner was coy about whether the poster gives away any plot teasers, telling the newspaper: ""This is related to the late ’60s, which is all I will say about it...It maintains the idea that this is somehow going on in Don Draper’s mind, which is what the story is always about — and what the back of his head is about, on some level.""

Smartwatches, for the most part, can be divided into two categories: vague approximations of the future like the Pebble, Gear, and Gear Fit, or conventionally styled watches from companies like Citizen and Cookoo that offer far less functionality. While it's true the Pebble Steel is making inroads in the aesthetic department, its blocky construction and oversized buttons aren't likely to appeal to the masses. Gábor Balogh is a freelance designer from Hungary who, like many of us, wants an attractive, watch-like watch that just happens to be smart. The difference between Balogh and the rest of us is he went ahead and designed an interface he believes could enable regular watch designs to include a full bevy of smart features. After posting his concept for a smartwatch on Behance, Balogh took some time to talk through his interface ideas with The Verge. The actual watch pictured in the mockups is almost incidental, as the concept simply takes the Swedish watchmaker Triwa's Havana timepiece (with the company's permission) and replaces its face with a circular display. This proposal is about interface paradigms, not product design. ""In this concept the UI does not have a predefined style,"" says Balogh, ""but it would match the housing. Only the navigational patterns have to be taken into consideration."" Although the interface itself will be down to watch and phone companies to decide, Balogh offers up some simple but polished ideas that go very well with Triwa's design. Pairing your smartphone to its watch will make the appropriate app icons appear on the display, with notifications, maps, and music information streamed from the device itself. When you don't want it to be a smartwatch, it mostly looks and behaves like a regular watch.  ""I like products with discreet technology,"" explains Balogh, ""when they serve me, my real needs, and make my life easier rather than simply changing my days."" He calls out the Nest thermostat and Apple's Airport Express as prime examples of technology being applied discretely without obscuring functionality. ""They're just ticking away in the background, making your life easier."" In an attempt to avoid obfuscation, Balogh's concept doesn't utilize a touchscreen or voice control. Instead, the interface uses the buttons and bezel found on most watches. The bezel is key to this interface. It can rotate to, for example, scroll through a long message or switch functions in an app, or be clicked to make a selection. The rotation element doesn't necessarily need to be physical — Balogh says he could imagine a more classical watch going with a physical dial, or a sporty design opting for an iPod-esque click wheel. Using the bezel for controlling apps and other smartphone-related tasks frees up the three side-mounted buttons to control  ""native"" functions like time, date, and alarms, as well as switching between modes. This clear separation of native and app functions should make the interface easily accessible to users familiar with how a regular watch works, while the lack of a touchscreen will stop the display from picking up smudges and grime from your fingers, and also stop your fingers from obscuring the display. ""The size of the watch is a very limiting factor, so we don't have to make it very smart. I see the watch as a piece of jewelry, and wanted to add an interface that would be familiar on a classic watch."" Of course, Balogh is a designer, not an engineer, and there are technological issues that will need to be overcome before we can hope to wear something like his concept on our wrists. Circular screens, although not impossible, are a rarity, and squeezing a battery and the necessary circuitry into the tiny space that usually contains mechanical watchworks would be difficult. That said, the guts of a Pebble are actually fairly small, and  larger watches may be able to contain them. As a busy freelance designer, it's unlikely Balogh will be able to muster the time or funds to assemble a team and make his concept a reality. But as technology advances it's easy to see a future where tech giants like Samsung rein in their ""futuristic"" designs and attempt to take on the Breitlings and Tag Heuers of the world with something like Balogh's idea.

""It’s an argument that’s happening — a tug of war,"" an unnamed ""industry source"" told Adweek. Twitter is said to be ""cautious"" about implementing autoplay, but the service already makes heavy use of video. In June, the company acquired SnappyTV, a tool that lets broadcasters easily share snippets of network programming, live sports, and other content immediately after it airs on television. Twitter's stuck numerous deals with ESPN and other ""multi-screen"" partners, many of whom have been running in-tweet video clips for over a year now.

AMC, the second-largest movie theater chain in North America, will pilot a partnership with MoviePass in two cities. Beginning in January, select theaters in Boston and Denver will offer MoviePass subscriptions priced between $35 and $45. The more expensive package will allow customers to see films in more immersive formats like IMAX and 3D, whereas the default option will be limited to regular screenings. AMC says the partnership will expand to include other cities, but isn't making any promises about where or when. ""The data will determine how fast we go,"" a spokesperson told The New York Times.  Two cities to start, and more if the pilot goes well For MoviePass, the AMC deal represents a huge step forward. In most theaters, the service is based around a somewhat complicated system that pairs MoviePass' smartphone app with a custom debit card used to cover the price of tickets. It works, but it's not exactly what you'd call a streamlined process. Previous talks with theaters weren't very productive, since many larger chains were reluctant to let MoviePass interfere with existing arrangements involving Fandango and other digital ticket sellers. Would you pay $45 to watch an IMAX movie every day of the month? Interestingly, AMC and MoviePass initially butted heads over the subscription approach to moviegoing. AMC was angry that it wasn't consulted during the service's development and instructed its theaters to refuse MoviePass beta participants. But apparently it's now sold on the idea — especially if MoviePass can help bring up attendance numbers. ""This pilot will provide more convenience for our guests, and responds to the preference of many consumers for monthly entertainment subscriptions such as music and magazines, which we believe will increase the frequency of movie going."" MoviePass wants to be the Spotify of movie theaters, but there's not much solid proof that consumers want that sort of thing. Either way, AMC doesn't need to worry about the subscription model upending its business; theaters will still take in the regular per-ticket rate on every MoviePass customer. AMC has conducted its own experiments to gauge consumer interest in new business models. Last month, it offered unlimited viewings of Interstellar to AMC Stubs members for $19.99 and above, depending on market. For MoviePass's approach to be profitable, the company has to hope that subscribers won't take it up on the movie-a-day offer. It's basically like a gym membership; you can choose to not go, but you'll still be paying the same every month.

""People don't realize yet how much Buzzfeed is doing.""

""And part of it is also, people don't realize yet how much Buzzfeed is doing."" Peretti says that it's ""starting to make a lot of sense for"" BuzzFeed to differentiate each vertical as a way to better service new business models and readers, particularly as it expands internationally and increases its focus on video. Native apps typically provide a better mobile experience than a website because of their enhanced speed, but this focus on native isn't strictly meant to improve the experience for BuzzFeed's readers. Rather, BuzzFeed is just as — if not more — interested in the richer data that native apps can gather about how people are reading, sharing, and interacting with content. ""That helps us make better stuff and learn and be engaged with our audience,"" Peretti says. He also sees native app users as readers who are going to visit and share more often, making it a compelling area for his company to invest in. That's particularly important today, as media companies try to figure out where readers are going for news as the spread of information moves away from specific home pages and over to social platforms like Facebook and Twitter. That's why BuzzFeed is willing to make such a significant investment on native apps.

Over the last twelve months the value of the ruble has plunged more than 50 percent against the dollar, destabilizing the Russian economy. That drop was already making it difficult for ordinary Russian citizens to purchase imported goods, but Apple's move shows things may get far worse, as foreign companies decide to stop accepting a currency that has been rapidly shedding value with each passing week. There are three major factors contributing to the broader collapse of the Russian economy, which in turn is hurting the ruble. The drop in the price of oil has hurt it badly, as the energy sector was the biggest driver of foreign capital into Russia. Western economic sanctions applied in response to the invasion of Crimea and dispute over Eastern Ukraine have also done damage. Finally, many Russian citizens, especially those with wealth, have lost confidence in the country's future. $100 billion in capital is expected to leave the country this year.   In recent weeks, Russian President Vladimir Putin has taken drastic action to try and reverse the economy's course. He pumped money from the country's sovereign wealth fund into banks to help them avoid default on loans that, with the collapse of the ruble, have become increasingly expensive to repay. And last night Russia instituted a dramatic interest rate hike, a last ditch effort that seems to have done little to prop up its ailing currency. The departure of Apple, an extremely high profile global brand, will no doubt add more fuel to the fire. ""We are seeing an economic crisis,"" Natalia V. Akindinova, a professor at the Higher School of Economics, told The New York Times. ""We are seeing a sharp devaluation of the ruble at a time when the central bank doesn’t have the reserves to influence the market, as it did in the past crises.""

It reaches the same young, hip demographic that labels are interested in, its ephemeral snaps make piracy a non-issue, and the company's LA origins give it a natural entry point into the industry. The company has already experimented with promoting specific bands in promotional snaps; the only question is how to turn it into a business. Snapchat considered starting a music label Leaked emails show that Snapchat CEO Evan Spiegel has considered a range of ideas for integrating music into Snapchat, including starting a music label and using the app to promote up-and-coming acts. But it's unclear how those projects might fit into the current product, and leaked emails also show a disconnect between Snapchat and the music industry that presents major problems to the project as currently conceived. The emails come from Sony Pictures CEO Michael Lynton, who's also an investor and member of Snapchat's board. (Snapchat declined to comment on the leaks.) Messages from early this summer show Spiegel taking meetings with Sony Music executives and industry luminaries like LA Reid, helped along by Lynton’s ample industry connections. Spiegel mused openly about the advantages of starting a music label, which would allow Snapchat to capture some of the financial benefits of the acts it promotes. The only missing piece was a music service — someone to sell the music Snapchat was creating buzz for. Spiegel was gun-shy about starting his own music service, so he set out to find a partner that could play a part in Snapchat's evolving plans. ""I think it will be challenging for them to sign up a lot of premium video partners with this particular stance."" In July, Spiegel wrote to Lynton looking for an introduction to Vevo executives. ""We're working on a new product and I think Vevo would be a great fit,"" he tells Lynton. But by August, the deal seemed to have collapsed. Vevo CEO Rio Caraeff writes back to Lynton saying the deal has hit a snag, which appears to be over the amount of advertising revenue that Snapchat would share with Vevo. ""They want 40 percent of gross [revenue], which is just not workable for us,"" Caraeff writes. ""We've proposed other percentage shares but they've all been rejected."" In short, Snapchat is driving a hard bargain, and is willing to wait for music video services to come around. ""Not asking you to do anything,"" Caraeff continues, ""just keeping you appraised as I think it will be challenging for them to sign up a lot of premium video partners with this particular stance."" ""We'd be losing money."" The biggest problem is the stark difference between the economics of the music industry and the tech world. A 40-percent revenue share isn't unheard of for app stores or platforms like YouTube, which typically takes 45 percent of ad revenue. Vevo itself has to share revenues with artists and labels, and negotiated a special deal with YouTube as a result. Snapchat's proposal comes out looking impossible by comparison. ""We'd be losing money,"" one Vevo executive said in an email, offering a blunt take on Snapchat's proposal. ""As discussed, our margins are fairly challenged."" The result is a stalemate not just with Vevo, but the industry at large. Services like iTunes and Google Music are in the same position as Vevo, without the profit margins to accommodate Snapchat's ambitions. If Snapchat gave in, lowering the revenue share to the standards of the music industry, it would likely find the result too meager to impress software-minded tech investors. The result is a standoff, with Snapchat expecting the same profit margins as platforms like YouTube and the industry seeing Snapchat as one more marketing channel. As long as neither side budges, we're unlikely to see a partnership any time soon.",0.49197404732426137,0.5080259526757387,0.8364820245289245,640,5.0374999999999996,353,6.0424929178470252,0,0,"Business, Report"

That’s a big tech story, and I spent an hour talking to BuzzFeed CEO Jonah Peretti about the media business, what technology actually helps BuzzFeed do, and what’s next for a company he says was a “cat site” three years ago. Nilay Patel: It sounds like you have some pretty exciting tech news going on. Jonah Peretti: I think that one of the interesting things about all the stuff we do in tech is that in general technology is harder for people to understand. Some of the stuff that I'm most excited about I don't get a chance to talk about as much. It seems exciting to me and is probably interesting to readers of The Verge, but there are a lot of people who love BuzzFeed for entertainment and news and how it gets to them isn't really as exciting as what is getting to them. Obviously we have a very big tech audience at The Verge, but I spent six months earlier this year working on the Vox.com team, and it was actually really interesting for me to step back and watch how our publishing platform helped that team scale so fast and hit a different big audience. We think about our platform so much that it almost circles back around to taking it for granted, and I suspect that that is true at BuzzFeed as well. Well, there's certain technology that you want to have disappear so it makes things faster and easier. Ev Williams likes to talk about technology that lets you skip a step — something took five steps now takes four steps. The benefit is something that isn't there. Then there also are other things where technology doesn't recede to the background, like a lot of the stuff we do with new post formats or slide-y things or quizzes or rubable GIFs. That’s all more in the category of fun technology that you get to play with. And now you’re buying a company to help you build native apps? Yes. Hyper IQ is based in Minneapolis, and it's a pretty exciting opportunity for us to continue to expand our tech team. As we get bigger, we've expanded the company to a lot of different cities around the world now. There was a period where that was frustrating, because we had everyone all in one office, and then we didn't, and now it's moved to another mode. We have a network forming, we have offices with critical mass that can build parts of what we're doing. We're doing so much more than we've ever done before, and there's nice big meaty things for people to work on. We'll grow to 30 people in Minneapolis, and this acquisition is the first step. How many other cities are you in? We're in, let's see… we're in London and Berlin, and Sydney, and DC. We're opening up in San Francisco right now. Sao Paulo, in Brazil. It's getting up there. Hyper IQ has been building your app thus far? We have a larger team in New York that's working on the apps, but [Hyper IQ] has been working with us. Part of the reason we wanted to acquire the company is that they've done such great work. Maybe this is a question that only a media nerd asks a media nerd, but it seems like a great deal of your investment in technology so far has been at the platform level and for content creation, while distribution has all been about making things really sharable and really great so people will share them. But buying a company to make a native app is a distribution side move. A native app puts your icon next to the Facebook icon on my phone. How do you think about that relationship? I think that things have really evolved fairly quickly. I think the classic model of a media company is that you have content and you have distribution, and usually they're pretty separate. One company makes content, another company does distribution, and they often have a deal, a partnership, to distribute the content. BuzzFeed has invested in a model that's more vertically integrated. We're building the technology and the site and the CMS, and also the brand and the content, and building this full-stack startup. What we're seeing now is that's become more complicated. You're starting to see more network-integrated companies — we have teams that are making great news, and entertainment, and lifestyle content. We break that up into News, Buzz, Life, and then video. That content is part of a vertically integrated site that lives on the web. And that same content is going to an app. And to native content formats on Facebook, on YouTube, on other platforms. And technology — I'm sort of describing a diagram in my head — technology is important at every single level. Technology is important for how you create the content: do you have tools to build games or quizzes or beautifully laid out longform articles or breaking news? The way the CMS works and the way that the format works is driven by technology, so having great technology for making content is important. Then having great technology for distributing content on your own site matters. How do you recommend articles? What you show in the thumbnails, what kind of recommendation system do you have? Then technology really adds to distribution on the other side — do you have a good way of tracking which of your YouTube videos are getting lots of views, and using that data to inspire teams to make things that will connect with the audience? So I think that when you look at the role of technology it's everywhere in this network-integrated model. You have content creation requiring or benefiting from technology, you have content on your own site and owned and operated properties, apps, and websites that benefit from technology, and then you have technology that is even really important when you're publishing to other platforms because there's APIs and ways of tracking what's happening to other platforms and understanding what that means on other platforms. That makes sense, but let me pull this out. This sounds like ‘BuzzFeed Everywhere.' You're pushing BuzzFeed content into every platform and you're making kind of every bet. You're making a web bet, you're making a ‘social-content-driving-back-to-your-website' bet, you're making a ‘we're putting an app on your homescreen' bet. Where does BuzzFeed live? Where do you think of as BuzzFeed's canonical home? I think it's becoming much more distributed. And people are still figuring out what that means. I think mobile apps are increasingly important to us. We care most about what’s best for consumers, so it's not like we have an ideological or religious view on where content should live. Should it be a native app, or on the web, or mobile web? It really should be dictated by what's best for the consumer and what's best long-term for building a media company that can thrive with how people are consuming media today instead of how they consumed media 10 years ago. When you think through that lens, things are becoming much more distributed. Our video business was over 800 million video views last month, we're on pace to do even more this month, and it's very distributed across other platforms. Our videos are on Facebook, on YouTube, on AOL, and on Yahoo. But we're able to use one dashboard to track how those videos are doing on all different platforms, and Ze Frank's video team in LA is able to learn from all of that data. So the key for us is publishing to wherever consumers really want to engage with our content — but can we get data and knowledge back so we can learn and get better? Also we should get money back, which allows us to fund doing more of it. If you have that, it doesn't matter where the content lives, but it does matter that you're able to get some knowledge and learning from it. That's the thing that traditional media sort of lacks. It’s a huge advantage for a tech-oriented media company that’s on a digital platform. If you're a traditional production company and you make a television show, you sell it to a network, and you get Nielsen ratings back. You don't really know much about which parts of your show people liked or didn't like, or what people thought about it. It's really hard to link producing content to a real relationship with your audience. I think with the technology base underneath everything we do, we're able to get knowledge back and have a closer relationship with our audience and serve the consumer better. That matters to us more than asking if the content is on mobile web or in a native app, or if it lives on our own properties or on some other property. So the news here is Hyper IQ. When you're thinking about BuzzFeed as distributed on every platform, what led you to actually buy the shop that's helping you build the native app? Native apps are extremely fast, and they are a great way to get to news and entertainment and video. Native apps can be a really great experience. The other reason we're really excited about native apps is that you can get data back in a really rich way about how people are engaging with your content. So that helps us make better stuff and be engaged with our audience. So that's a big reason. [Hyper IQ] has really talented engineers who are doing great work, located in a city where there’s a lot of great engineering talent. We think that we can provide really great opportunities for them to do really interesting work that they might not be able to do or find elsewhere. I think Minneapolis is an underrated tech town. There's a lot of really great engineers there. The other thing we see, and lots of publishers see, is that the users of our mobile apps share at a higher rate. They visit more frequently and read more. It's also a place where it makes lots of sense for us to invest. The Verge used to have an app, and we actually just shut it down in favor of responsive web. One of the reasons was that we weren't able to innovate as fast as we were on the web. How are you going to manage that as you're more native? So this is a real challenge. If you come up with web development as your core, you get used to the ability to deploy multiple times a day, to test features with 5 percent of your audience, and only rolling out to your audience once you see that it works well. A lot of agile development and flexible testing is much harder to do in an app environment. It's harder to do for technical reasons, it's harder to do because of app store approval, and pushing your app is really a big deal. Pushing a deploy to the Buzzfeed.com website is a trivial thing that really any engineer is able to do because we've built all kinds of tools to make deployment easier on web.  That's great, because you can do more faster and have shorter loops and shorter cycles of development. But mobile apps are somewhere between the web and old-school desktop software development, where there’s the big release once a year and the patch to fix bugs. So it is a challenge, and that's primarily why we wanted to hire 30 people in Minneapolis and many more than that in New York and LA and San Francisco and other places. The tech team is over 110 people now, and we want to go to 250 people by the end of next year. It's a big investment to develop for all the different platforms that are out there. We feel that it's worth it. We won't be able to develop as quickly as we do on the web and have as short a dev cycle, but you can start to figure out ways. It's a kind of different mindset of how you build things — if you have a big enough team you can start to really push features that aren't even possible to the web, because they're native. When you look at our app now, we spent really a year working on underlying architecture and making sure that it loaded quickly, it didn't crash, and it was designed in such a way that we could build some cool features. It would seem crazy to spend that amount of time on the web. Now we're ready to start building some of the cool features that will be more noticeable. We went from having an app that crashed a lot at the beginning of the year to having an app that was in the Best Apps of the Year on the Android and iOS App Stores. So it is a challenging thing, and my natural impatience which stems from being used to the web is definitely [tried] sometimes. Sometime I want to be able to think of an idea, test it a week later with a small percentage of the users, see if it works, and then roll it out. And [with an app] you have to think much more strategically and build things on longer cycles that you know or hope will have a bigger impact. So you're doing things, you're taking longer strides, which can be frustrating or scary. Let me get back to the idea of putting an icon on the home screen. It's something I think about a lot. You’re putting an icon next to Facebook. Once you start delivering better and better experiences in your native app, especially for something like video where the best experience is native, how do you think about competing with Facebook which drives all of the traffic to your other media types? Well, it's really similar to BuzzFeed's homepage. It's not that it's competing with Facebook, it's that we have a dedicated audience that comes to BuzzFeed. Whether they come to our app or our homepage, they're the ones who initially share things to Facebook. Our content wouldn't even be on Facebook if it wasn't for people who thought it was worth sharing with their friends. The app really will be a smaller number of visitors, but they'll be the ones with the biggest influence on what BuzzFeed stories initially are getting shared. I see it as part of a larger ecosystem of content discovery, where apps created by media companies are actually pretty important because there's a place people can discover content they think is worth spreading across a social network. So in a way our app is a service to allow people to find stuff that they want to share into other services. I spend a lot of time thinking about homepages, because we have a big one. The Verge is older in that way. How big is the BuzzFeed homepage? Do you guys spend a lot of time thinking about it? How do you think about programming the first screen of the app? So we're actually kind of deep in this right now. Part of adding additional tech resources is really building collaboration between engineers and editorial people. That practice is core to what we do on the web — there's folks on the engineering team working closely with editorial people, and they go back and forth, and they develop ideas. It's kind of a rare thing to have a tech team at our scale that also gets to work with the people making the content. We can point out a new format that inspires an editor to make something, or an editor has an idea that's inspired by new technology, or there are new ways to display content. That's something that we want to also do with apps. And we haven't done it on the same level with apps. Sometimes the app is getting programmed by what's happening on the web, and that doesn't really make sense. People visit the BuzzFeed app many times a day more than the average person is looking at the homepage of the site. So it’s something that we're pretty excited about. We've got some star editors and star developers working together to define how to program the front page of an app, and how much personalization to have, and how to say this is important news. All that has to be a real partnership between great editors and great developers. So there’s personalization that happens in your app? There is some light personalization that we played with in an earlier version of the app, where you would choose what you liked and didn't like. Now we're working on some subtler, more automatic personalization. Apps definitely lend themselves to personalization in a way that is easier than the web — even if you don't have a logged-in user, if they're using the app, you have a sense of the person. But I don't think we want necessarily want [the app] personalized. You probably do if you’re Facebook or Twitter, but if you're a news organization, you also want to sometimes take an editorial stance where you tell people something because it's important. Once you go down the road of having a native app, having the content right there, having some offline capability, and then doing some algorithmic personalization based on interests, you’re basically creating the next news feed, right? I hate to keep hammering in the idea that you're competing with Facebook, but it's an easy thing to draw the broad strokes of. We don't really have any plans to do personalization on that level. We will always have a weird, eclectic mix of things that we're creating. We don't have a universe of a kajillion stories to personalize for each individual person. We have the stuff we're making, and even though we have a large editorial team and reporters around the world, and all kinds of great content, it's still content being made by one organization, and not the entire world. The primary way that people get a personalized content experience with BuzzFeed content is the Facebook newsfeed or their Twitter feed or Pinterest or YouTube. But when you come to BuzzFeed, directly to our homepage or our app, the kind of personalization we would want is much lighter than that. It’s like, say you hate cute kittens because you're a monster with no empathy. So you don't see any cute animal content. Or you don't like sports, or you love sports, you have a certain category. Some people really care about what's up with Taylor Swift and the latest in celebrity stuff. Other people find celebrity news enraging. We realize that there are some people who may want a hard news experience and some people who may want mostly video and love all the stuff we're doing with video, and there's some people who will like the mix of stuff but they don't want X, Y, or Z, or they want a little more of A, B, or C. That's the kind of personalization that makes sense for us. The heavyweight personalization that social networks do either through something like the follow graph on Twitter or through more algorithmic approach on Facebook is designed to give people the stuff that they want. What we're focused on is giving people stuff that they think is worth sharing with other people. We want the stories we're doing to have the biggest possible impact. So if we do personalization, it would be more of a personalization about what you’re most likely to share or discuss with your friends. You can do video much better in the native app. Is that going to be an immediate focus, or is that going to be something that you build towards? Well, our video business is pretty distributed. We’re getting the native video viewing experience by distributing our video into other native players. So we could have said we're really investing heavily in video, let's put this all in our own player, and let’s make people use that player. The problem is that even if we had an iOS native player and experience in our app, our video wouldn’t be be native in Facebook's app. Right? We want our video to be native when people open in Facebook's app, because it will have the silent autoplay and all those things that are native to that environment. So, it's not this crucial, pressing thing where people will not be able to watch BuzzFeed video or that people won't have a good experience watching BuzzFeed video because it's mobile web, because most of the views now aren't happening in mobile web. They're happening in native players of other sites where we take our video, or other services where we take our video. Sure, but I mean, that raises a pretty obvious question of how well can you monetize your video when you're distributing views across a million different players? I mean, our video business is in the hyper-growth stage. There's about 150 people in a four-acre studio lot in Los Angeles that Ze Frank runs. We've built it essentially as a break-even business while in hyper-growth mode. So, we probably should be investing more in it, but we make branded video. Things like Dear Kitten, which we made for Purina, is a great piece of content that’s also an advertisement for cat food. It works as content and also has amazing effects on purchase intent. And we can take what we know about making great video and make a branded version of that video, and use that as a way of monetizing. And then we also have all of the monetization that is part of YouTube, which is kind of light monetization but with the amount of views we have, it can actually add up to something pretty significant. Video is really interesting to me. One thing I think about the multiplier effect of technology. The way you scale and the way we scale is that our platforms allow us to scale for cheap or free. You can add one more reader for free. And if you're really good, the platforms enable you to create content at a lower cost as well, because it's easier to make one more quiz or the format lends itself to something more popular. You can get more efficiency out of one more employee. That is not true right now with our platform, I’ll be honest, or I'm guessing your platform when it comes to video creation. Because you make a CMS that enables you to write or publish a quiz really fast, but you don't make a video editing software that allows you to make animated explainers for YouTube the way that After Effects lets you do it. So you are constrained by the old way, and technology doesn't provide nearly as much of a multiple in video. How are you attacking that problem? I see that as a big problem for every technology company that wants to go into video, and I say that as a man who works at a technology company that invests in video. I'm very curious about this answer. Well, some of it is the reason we have that LA campus is that it allows us to build a set, and we have green screens and facilities. All of that is an upfront cost, and then the variable cost of making a video is actually very low because we have all of that in place. So it's not really of what you would think of as technology, but it's partly why the old studio lot model makes sense — you end up having the ability to make video at a lower cost because you have resources and facilities and talent all together in one place. Then all the data that you get back helps you learn which formats work, which actors work, which topics are people interested in, and that furthers creative development. You're not just outsourcing it to a production company — you actually have the people making the videos learning based on how the videos are being distributed. Then I think there are some technology factors where you build technology to help you syndicate video, to help you track it, help you understand potential technology benefits to make workflow faster, better, make it easier to translate videos. I think that usually there's ways to generate some advantages from technology or from organizational or operational initiatives, but it's more expensive to make video, and the cost of failure is higher, and the way video is shared is different, and it's all these things that make it challenging. It isn't it just any improvement based on technology and operations. I read a couple days ago Ben Smith saying that in three years he doesn't think BuzzFeed will exist in its current form. Can you tell me what Ben was talking about and what you think that means? He was talking about all the stuff we've been talking about. It's hard to predict three years out, so part of it was saying, ""Who knows what'll happen in three years, what the web will be like in three years?"" We've been based on a model of continual change. Three years ago, BuzzFeed had no reporters. Two years ago we had no video. One year ago we didn't have foreign correspondents around the world or an investigative team. Three years ago we were a cat site, an internet meme site. So a lot has changed in three years. It's an out-of-context quote — Ben was talking about the changes that have happened in three years. We went from the traditional media model of content and distribution to the vertically-integrated model of content distribution technology to the network-integrated model of technology helping at every level. Technology helping with content creation and then that content going on our platforms, distributed across the web, potentially going to traditional platforms like television or print. We don't really have plans to do any print. But there's a possibility of having something that you look at and think that this isn't a site, this is a global media company. It's not just a site, it's a whole process for distributing news, buzz, life, on the web, mobile, native apps, and it looks very different than it looks today. When you think about that process of going from one stage to another to landing at the network-distributed model, in terms of consumer experience, where does the technology have the most impact? Where's the place that you're delivering to them the best experience? So the media bundle, if it’s the newspaper, it lands on your doorstep, you go through it, and see all the different sections, and it’s the complete, canonical version. And I think what you see now is technology and engineering is having a bigger impact on what the bundle is. Instead of one bundle, we ended up with lots of bundles. We're some percentage of a Facebook newsfeed bundle, we're some percentage of Twitter's bundle, we're some percentage of Pinterest's bundle, and so there's all these personalized bundles that are being delivered by technology, and we're a part of it. And then when it comes to our app, and to our homepage and to our properties that we're developing, most of that is our content, so then the app becomes a bundle that is 80 percent BuzzFeed content. Maybe there's some other links or other content, but it's mostly our content. And so you end up with multiple bundles. Depending on who you ask you'll get a very different view of what BuzzFeed is. We’re moving a world where there will be multiple bundles, and that's why technology is so important, because engineers are able to understand this dynamic bundling, which is a different way of thinking about the media industry. They’re able to build better bundles. And brands will matter across this distributed landscape. BuzzFeed needs to stand for a certain kind of quality and sensibility — we need to make things that deserve to be in other people's bundles, and we'll have our own bundles that we create. Which is part of what the team in Minneapolis will build with the app they'll work on. Most of the media industry regards BuzzFeed's technology advantage as some sort of dark magic — a mixture of platform and social prowess that's terrifying for an older generation of media companies. And for good reason: they likely can't change their culture or develop their platforms fast enough to compete. But what scares BuzzFeed in the same way? What don't you guys understand? I don't understand the traditional media business, so the feeling is mutual! And it is still huge and powerful, in scale and especially revenue. We are very small compared to Disney, Viacom, Time Warner, and the other big guys. BuzzFeed excels when we can combine art and science. This is why we focus on platforms where creative people can try ideas, get feedback from the world, and use it to learn and get better everyday. This is why developing the technology for our own site and apps is so important to us and why we invest so much in data science. And it is also why we invest in platforms like Facebook and YouTube that give us data back to incorporate into our creative process. This isn't possible in print, broadcast, or traditional films which may be why the media industry is such a dysfunctional place. Executives make huge bets based on gut, it’s hugely expensive to take risks, and most projects fail. It’s enough to drive anyone a little crazy. I don't understand that world, and it scares me. And I also get scared whenever a tech platform wants to evolve to be more like cable TV or more like the media industry, by locking up the data and tightly controlling media consumption. In the long run, I think the platforms that share data with creators will win and so will the media companies that hire lots of great engineers to help make sense of that data and put it into action.",0.6517307606653574,0.3482692393346426,0.14346285076658405,5091,4.5963464938126108,1338,6.3781763826606879,0,0,"Business, Tech, Exclusive, Interview"

CEO Evan Spiegel regularly trades emails with Sony Pictures CEO Michael Lynton, who sits on Snapchat's board, and the revelations from the pair's emails have been spilling out all week. Among them: the company secretly bought a company that makes a Google Glass-like product; it's actively pursuing plans to insert music into the app; and the company turned down a bigger offer from Facebook than the $3 billion originally reported. But there are other revelations in there, too: that Chinese internet company Tencent felt insulted by him during fundraising negotiations, for example, and that he and his co-founder sought to take $40 million for themselves during a fundraising round. Today Spiegel addressed the revelations in a letter to his employees that he later shared on Twitter. It's a personal, powerful note about the importance of keeping secrets — a theme consistent with his company's app, which famously enables a more private kind of sharing. ""We keep secrets because we love surprising people,"" he wrote. ""We keep secrets because we get to do our work free from judgment — until we're ready to share it. We keep secrets because keeping secrets gives you space to change your mind."" ""We're going to change the world because this is not the one we want to live in."" Spiegel said the revelations have been personally upsetting — ""I felt like I was going to cry all morning,"" he says. But he said that after giving everyone on his team some time to be upset, that everyone would ""keep doing exactly what we were doing. And then we're going to do it 10 times better.""

According to Business Insider, the round could include investment from Peter Thiel's Founders Fund. The budding marijuana moguls behind Privateer used to be known for their ""straight, corporate image"" and their Ivy League pedigrees. That is until they roused the ghost of Bob Marley and turned him into a brand. Last month, Privateer launched Marley Natural, a global pot line ""based on the legacy of Bob Marley.""  Marley Natural,"" as the brand is called, unrolled with the family of Bob Marley fully on board and granting interviews. The announcement arrived with a slick promotional video, featuring misty mountains and the late reggae singer’s classic ""Could You Be Loved,"" as well as a lion-centered logo designed by upmarket Seattle branding company Heckler Associates, also responsible for the Starbucks mermaid.   Just wait until Privateer gets its hand on the Tupac hologram. Business Insider, which first reported Thiel's potential involvement, says investors behind the $75 million round assume Privateer is already worth $425 million, however the deal is not finalized, so the numbers could change. A filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission shows that Privateer was hoping to raise $75 million and secured $18.6 million towards that goal by mid-July. Privateer is trying to professionalize the cannabis industry through the legitimizing powers of capitalism The economy around legalized marijuana has been hampered by concerns about federal regulation. When I went to a demo day last year, for example, none of the weed startups dealt directly with the plant. But if venture capital dollars can help professionalize Bitcoin, perhaps Privateer can do the same for pot. Since launching in 2011, Business Insider says Privateer has made strategic investments along ""the weed supply chain"": Privateer quietly bought up another startup in the space, Leafly, which is like Yelp for weed products. In 2013, Privateer launched Lafitte Ventures, which focuses on medical marijuana, and Tilray, which mails medical weed to users and generated nearly $200,000 in revenue last year. Privateer is also exploring a testing facility (Arbormain) in Washington state. The founders may launch their own weed-focused investment fund, too, so Privateer can pour money into external cannabis companies. These diversified initiatives are not yet profitable, but revenue is growing. According to Business Insider, Privateer generated $1.2 million in net revenue in 2013 and expects nearly $11 million this year. Up to 70 percent of the money comes from Lafitte Ventures, a company based in Canada that delivers ""premium-quality medical cannabis."" Privateer thinks it will be profitable by next year, projecting $111 million in net revenue in 2015 and $440 million in 2016. A libertarian like Thiel seems like a natural choice for a financier. He donates to fringe groups dedicated to the Singularity and seasteading. Meanwhile Founders Fund was once synonymous with the motto: ""We wanted flying cars, instead we got 140 characters"" and likes to think of itself as a bunch of free-thinking futurists. During his book tour, Thiel took another jab at those 140 characters, maligning marijuana in the process: ""Twitter is hard to evaluate,"" Mr. Thiel said in an interview on CNBC on Wednesday. ""They have a lot of potential. It’s a horribly mismanaged company — probably a lot of pot-smoking going on there."" That's the nice thing about stylizing yourself as a contrarian, though.

The three largest chains in the US — AMC, Regal, and Cinemark — are reported to have called off screenings for the movie, as has Cineplex, the largest chain in Canada. While Sony has not officially cancelled release of The Interview, its availability only at small theater chains means that it will be unwatchable for many potential viewers.  Sony chose not to delay the film These cancellations are likely to account for a significant monetary loss for Sony, which has been gearing up to release the film on Christmas. Sony could always choose to release the film online and on-demand, which has become an increasingly popular practice for helping smaller films gain buzz, but that would hardly bring in the type of money it expected to make on a widely released Christmas-day comedy. In light of the cancellations, Deadline reports that Sony is also ending all TV advertising for the film. Counting just AMC, Regal, Cinemark, and Carmike — which cancelled plans to screen the film yesterday — Sony can rule out having The Interview shown on nearly half of movie screens in the US. According to The Wall Street Journal, there are around 40,000 screens in total, and those four chains account for 18,000 alone. Those theaters have reportedly decided that they will not screen the film at least until a federal investigation into the threats and cyberattack is closed. Theater chains asked Sony to delay the film's release, but it chose not to, the Journal reports. Instead, Sony said that it would not penalize theaters for choosing not to screen the film, despite prior commitments to do so. The decision for the biggest chains to not show The Interview was reportedly made on a conference call this morning with their trade group, the National Association of Theatre Owners. ""The ability of our guests to enjoy the entertainment they choose in safety and comfort is and will continue to be a priority for theater owners,"" NATO says in a statement. The group also said that ""individual cinema operators may decide to delay exhibition of the movie so that our guests may enjoy a safe holiday movie season experiencing the many other exciting films we have to offer."" Regal and Cineplex suggest they could still play The Interview at a later date Regal and Cineplex have released statements as well, with both chains suggesting that they could still screen The Interview in the future. ""Due to the wavering support of the film The Interview by Sony Pictures, as well as the ambiguous nature of any real or perceived security threats, Regal Entertainment Group has decided to delay the opening of the film in our theaters,"" Regal says, according to Deadline. ""After careful consideration of this unprecedented and complex situation, Cineplex Entertainment will postpone presentation of the Sony Pictures movie, The Interview,"" Cineplex executive Pat Marshall says in a statement. ""Cineplex takes seriously its commitment to the freedom of artistic expression, but we want to reassure our guests and staff that their safety and security is our number one priority. We look forward to a time when this situation is resolved and those responsible are apprehended."" This threat has put theater owners and Sony in a tough spot. While Homeland Security says that it has no evidence that this is a legitimate threat, the threat was made by the hackers who broke into Sony, showing that they are at least a technologically capable crew. Choosing as a group to not show the film seemingly ensures safety for those theaters' patrons, while also making sure those theaters don't miss out on a significant share of profits. The threats were made yesterday by the Sony hacking group, which calls itself ""Guardians of Peace."" The group referenced 9/11 and said that they ""recommend you to keep yourself distant"" from movie theaters screening the film. The film's stars, James Franco and Seth Rogen, subsequently cancelled press appearances while smaller theater chains began to pull out of screenings. The Sony hack began in late November when its computer systems were brought down worldwide. Over the past week, information stolen from its systems — such as executives' emails and employees' social security numbers — have been published online, including a release yesterday that came along with the threat on theaters. North Korea is widely suspected to be involved with the hack, though it has denied involvement. The Interview focuses on the assassination of its leader, Kim Jong-un, and ends with his graphic death. That choice has seemingly upset the country's government.

Last week, two companies withdrew from Facebook's Internet.org project, citing neutrality concerns, and the remaining companies are facing mounting pressure to bail out. But while Internet.org has drawn most of the headlines in the US, it's just one part of a much larger struggle in India, and one that could have serious consequences for the developing world at large. ""My first reaction when I saw the consultation paper was, we're fucked."" The most recent outcry started not with Facebook, but with the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (also known as TRAI). On March 30th, TRAI issued a white paper on internet regulation and asked for reactions from the public. The call for responses is part of the process for new telecom rules in India, akin to the FCC's calls for comment, but this paper seemed designed to scare people off, stretching over 118 pages with confusing language and ominous suggestions for how telecoms might tame the web. The backlash was immediate. ""The TRAI paper is suggesting that each and every one of [the apps on your phone] needs to get a license to be used in India,"" one site wrote, as part of a summary of the paper. For others, like Nikhil Pahwa, the message was even worse: ""My first reaction when I saw the consultation paper was, we're fucked."" Pahwa helps run a website covering Indian startups, and he’s now a volunteer organizer with Savetheinternet.in, one of the central hubs for the latest surge of net neutrality organizing. The first thing he did was put out a call for volunteers on Twitter. Together, Pahwa and the volunteers worked to simplify the paper, boiling it down to a few key points that casual readers could understand, and providing an easy portal for citizens who wanted to respond. The site started climbing /r/india and circulating in other forums. The popular YouTube comedy group All India Bakchod made a video called ""Save The Internet,"" which racked up 2.5 million views in less than a week, driving even more people to the site. Before the TRAI paper, the neutrality issue hadn’t hit home Indian blogs had raised similar concerns when Internet.org launched in India back in February, but before the TRAI paper, the issue hadn’t fully hit home. Internet.org was pitched as an accessibility effort, connecting the vast portions of the Indian population that still can’t afford web access. Internet.org offers free access to specific sites, including Facebook and specific partners for weather and news. The hope is that Internet.org's limited web will be better than nothing, but startups are already worried about the program setting up an uneven playing field. Mark Zuckerberg still denies that the program violates net neutrality, but most observers say that it does. If Indians can access certain apps without paying for a data plan — also known as ""zero-rating"" — it will make it hard for apps and service outside of Internet.org to break into the market, particularly when those decisions are being made a continent away. But for Indian activists, the fire didn’t catch on until the TRAI paper gave web-goers something to respond to. There's a lot in TRAI’s white paper that would be objectionable on basic web freedom grounds, including a proposal that would require services to register with telecoms in advance. While the backlash was in full swing, the Indian telecom Airtel announced a new platform called ""Airtel Zero"" that would offer free access to specific apps — similar to AT&T's now-endangered Sponsored Data program. That created an even larger backlash among Indian startups, who were worried about being priced out by wealthier American competitors. The collective outcry led to Indian partners pulling out of both Airtel Zero and Internet.org, preferring data charges over bad publicity. ""India is essentially ground-zero for zero-rating globally."" But while Airtel might be a more immediate threat than Internet.org, the movement isn't sparing any punches for Mark Zuckerberg's zero-rating program. Like Airtel, Internet.org is offering a zero-rated version of the internet — one that offers free access to certain sites, but makes users pay for the rest of the web. Airtel wanted sites to pay for that preferential access, while Internet.org is offering it as a kind of charity, but the net effect is the same: poor web users will be effectively confined to the free section of the web, and smaller sites will have a much harder time breaking in. Zuckerberg defended the program in a series of statements last week: ""The internet is one of the most powerful tools for economic and social progress,"" he wrote in a post. ""I believe everyone in the world deserves access to these opportunities."" The organizers at SaveTheInternet.in haven't been impressed. ""Internet.org isn't increasing internet access,"" Pahwa told me. ""It's increasing Facebook access."" Whoever wins the fight, the consequences could reach far beyond India. The Internet.org app is already available in Zambia, Ghana, Kenya, Tanzania, and Colombia. With a massive population and a thriving tech sector, India might be the most attractive country for subsidized web access, but it's far from the only one. If the system works there, it will be easy to apply the same playbook in low-connectivity countries across the world. As Pahwa puts it, ""India is essentially ground-zero for zero-rating globally.""",0.4199235996111407,0.5800764003888593,0.5244786069875845,884,5.1425339366515841,470,6.2127659574468082,0,0,"US & World, Report"

""Since they don’t make spectrum anymore, and since spectrum is the pathway of the 21st century, we have to figure out how we’re going to live with a fixed amount,"" said FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler said during Friday's session. ""Sharing is key to that."" The Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) plan — yes, that's a mouthful — will open frequencies from 3550MHz to 3700MHz to commercial companies; right now, they're mostly being used by radar systems belonging to the US Army and Navy. These airwaves don't travel very fall or provide strong wall penetration, and it'll likely be years before your smartphone can harness them. But eventually, they could be used to bolster small cell deployments, LTE hotspots, and other applications that companies haven't figured out yet. Wheeler spoke of the benefits of the FCC's ""historic"" shared approach last month in a blog post. At that time, he said: The 3.5 GHz band is an innovation band. As a result of technological innovations and new focus on spectrum sharing, we can combine it with adjacent spectrum to create a 150 megahertz contiguous band previously unavailable for commercial uses. It provides an opportunity to try new innovations in spectrum licensing and access schemes to meet the needs of a multiplicity of users, simultaneously. And, crucially, we can do all of this in a way that does not harm important federal missions. The military won't have to worry about interference So how does the FCC intend to prevent interference in those frequencies? It's got a plan. The proposal calls for a three-tiered system; at the top is the federal government along with other users already running satellite and radar services on the 3.5GHz band. They're guaranteed protection from interference caused by those operating in the lower two tiers. (The Defense Department can also establish exclusion zones around the coasts where commercial users aren't allowed.) One step below that, the FCC will auction off short-duration licenses that are also shielded from interference from the lowest tier, which is called the General Authorized Access tier. This is most similar to unlicensed spectrum in that any company with an FCC-certified device won't need additional approval from the commission to start using the shared spectrum. Nothing's happening yet, though; in approving the proposal, the FCC also said it will open up another public comment period to address the many complexities of shared spectrum. But tech companies and the FCC's own commissioners are excited. ""This is big,"" said Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel, describing the FCC's move as ""a paradigm shift that paves the way for new services, new technologies, and more mobile broadband.""",0.5422331445906665,0.4577668554093335,0.8611521160553779,467,5.1948608137044969,301,6.0764119601328908,0,0,"Mobile, Policy & Law, Tech, US & World"

A statement released this week by the Ministry of Culture confirms a switch-off date that was proposed by the Norwegian government back in 2011. The government has concluded that the country is capable of meeting all the requirements necessary for a smooth transition to digital. FM is eight times more expensive than DAB ""Listeners will have access to more diverse and pluralistic radio-content, and enjoy better sound quality and new functionality,"" Minister of Culture Thorhild Widvey said in a statement.

The Sun originally reported that Stingrays had been used more than 25,000 times, but has since adjusted the figure to 4,300, as previously reported. The Baltimore Police Department is starting to come clean about its use of cell phone signal interceptors — commonly known as Stingrays — and the numbers are alarming. According to recent court testimony reported by The Baltimore Sun, the city's police have used Stingray devices with a court order more than 4,300 times. That number doesn't include any emergency uses of the device, which would have proceeded without a court order. Stingrays work by mimicking cell towers, sniffing out phones and triangulating their location once the phones start to transmit. Because the Stingray is masquerading as a conventional cell tower, it disrupts any cell traffic in the vicinity of the target as well, often cutting out service for other devices in the area. A number of projects have attempted to build Stingray detectors, but those devices have often been accused of excessive false positives, effectively overstating the spread of Stingrays. In one recent test in Washington, DC, a detector found 18 different Stingray-like disturbances over less than two days, suggesting that either the detector is faulty or the devices are far more widespread than previously believed. If the numbers are true, they suggest aggressive and sustained use of a technology that is still largely undisclosed by civilian police departments. Police departments still routinely drop cases rather than reveal the use of Stingrays in court, most recently in a robbery case in St. Louis. The devices have been defended as measures for emergency-use only — often in the case of a cell phone-triggered bomb. But using the device nine times a day would mean it has become a routine part of police work in Baltimore, and potentially other US cities as well.",0.4384873902751637,0.5615126097248363,0.8190578749087439,323,5.1764705882352944,197,6.126903553299492,0,0,"US & World, National Security"

Joining the iconic children's book series we grew up with ""The Star Wars franchise has woven itself into the hearts and minds of generations of fans, many of whom read Little Golden Books as children,"" said Jeanne Mosure of Disney Publishing Worldwide in the official release. ""We’re very excited to be incorporating Little Golden Books into our overarching strategy so parents can now introduce their own children to the wonders of the galaxy through this classic format."" The books will be available on July 28th, with a complete boxed set seeing release on September 1st. We have just one question, though: how can anyone make the birth of Darth Vader look cute?

BitSummit 2015 was over by the time Nintendo made its tragic announcement, and countless developers and attendees would have been leaving Kyoto with a pretty positive impression of the future of Japanese games. Now in its third year, BitSummit is solidified as an essential event for anyone in the region interested in indie games — a growing number, despite the Japanese indie scene getting off to a slow start. The show was bigger than ever in 2015, with a much-improved layout where games were arranged around a circular stage. The stage hosted talks from industry luminaries like Shuhei Yoshida, Tetsuya Mizuguchi, and Koji Igarashi, and this year it was easy to pay attention to them while checking out the games on show. Which is, of course, the most important thing about BitSummit — the games on the floor. Here are the best we saw. It’s hard to talk about Vane without discussing its provenance. Tokyo indie studio Friend and Foe was formed by people that were working on The Last Guardian, the third game from director Fumito Ueda that spent years in development hell before Sony resurrected it at E3 last month. And on the face of Vane’s BitSummit showing, Friend and Foe has learned a few things from Ueda’s Ico and Shadow of the Colossus; the new game takes place in a dreamy, minimalist world that you learn about through exploration and puzzle-solving. But there’s enough on show to suggest that Vane could escape its own shadow. The mysterious lead character can turn into a crow, for instance, which mixes things up considerably. And the gorgeous art style, which won Vane the BitSummit Visual Excellence award, is already a head-turner at this early stage. The indoor environments combine flat-shaded polygons with some subtle lighting techniques, resulting in a game that really looks like no other. Do you yearn for the days of horror games with snail-paced combat, tank-style controls, and low-polygon characters? Or at least have some degree of pained nostalgia? Well, does Takaaki Ichijo ever have the game for you. His Back in 1995 is a throwback to a time when clunky survival horror games like Resident Evil could shock the gaming world and sell millions of copies all at once. In a neat touch, the game is actually set in 1995, lending an extra air of authenticity to the janky proceedings. Back in 1995 is not, it has to be said, a great deal of fun to actually play in its present state. But it’s more performance art than video game, a work made with attention to detail and genuine love from its creator. In its obsessive recreation of an era most players would prefer to forget, it’s a little like a video game equivalent of a Tarantino throwback movie. The difference is that even Death Proof is easier to get through. Action Button Entertainment's Videoball isn’t a Japanese game, but I’m including it here because it was the most fun I had on the BitSummit show floor. It’s a four-player virtual sport with simple rules and retro-futuristic pastel presentation, and it’s a total blast. As with last year’s Sportsfriends collection, it captures why sports games are perfect for same-room competition while casting aside all the trappings of real-life sports. Like current PS4 talk-of-the-town Rocket League, Videoball involves piloting your ship / car / character into balls to score goals. Unlike Rocket League, Videoball’s top-down 2D perspective, one-button control scheme, and ultra-clean, legible visuals make it a much more immediate and strategic experience, even if you’re picking up the game for the first time. I played a few raucous rounds with three Japanese strangers, and by the end I felt like my teammate and I would be comrades for life. (He got up at the end, said ""thank you,"" and walked away, but that’s not the point.) Videoball is due out this summer on PS4, Xbox One, and PC, and it will probably be worth holding a house party for. Drunk Room is a room-escape game that’s already out on iOS and Android in Japan, but was lent a new level of absurdity in its VR-powered BitSummit showing. The premise: you wake up on your wedding day to a trashed apartment, with beer cans stacked everywhere, graffiti on the wall, and important items locked in cabinets. The base game is pretty unremarkable for what it is, but the Oculus Rift elevates it to hilarity. VR is still new enough technology to make me feel a little light-headed every time I try it, which Drunk Room manages to turn to its advantage. The simple, blocky visuals, with their Katamari Damacy color palette, only add to the surreal vibe as you frantically try to piece together your night and save your impending marriage. Although it wasn’t playable on the show floor, Muse: Together is the New Alone still managed to be one of the more intriguing games at BitSummit. It’s directed by Baiyon, the musician and visual artist who collaborated with Q-Games on the excellent PS3 indie hit PixelJunk Eden, and it has a striking visual style that blends vivid watercolor paintings with EarthBound-esque minimalist pixel art. The game is described as a ""nostalgic adventure"" and is set to see release on PlayStation 4 and Vita, though there’s no date yet. While indie developers in the West often cut their teeth on retro platformers and text adventures, a lot of Japanese designers are starting with room-escape games as a simple way to get a story out there. And Magniflop’s Strange Telephone has a neat spin on the concept, mixing pixel-art with J-horror and rendering the game as a 2D sidescroller. The result, at least in its BitSummit showing, is a little linear and easy. It could be hard for Strange Telephone’s 2D puzzles to match the complexity of first-person room-escape games, although some light action elements may add variety in the long run. Still, if it all comes together Strange Telephone looks like a good example of a Japanese indie game that executes on a solid, simple idea with style — something we could do with more of. It’ll be out this year on PC, iOS, and Android. The pragmatically titled 木造校舎を歩く (A Walk in a Wooden Schoolhouse) is a short virtual reality experience that comes in two flavors. Both are set in the same old school, but where one version is bathed in golden sunlight and underscored by cheerful music, the other is cast in gloom and home to some serious paranormal activity. The over-saturation of Japanese schoolgirls in horror movies should have diluted their impact as a vector for scares, but when one appeared in the dark classroom’s mirror, my very physical reaction nearly jerked the game developer’s laptop clean off its display table. Nearby, a 10-yen piece slid across a Kokkuri-san board — Japan’s answer to ouija boards — seemingly of its own accord. Built by two hobbyist game designers in their spare time and less a game than a vignette, A Walk in a Wooden Schoolhouse nonetheless manages to quickly cultivate a sense of foreboding, thanks in part to the economy of scares — the short demonstration only showed the ""monster"" for a minute — and to the Oculus Rift I had strapped to my face. Even standing in the middle of a crowd of people, the VR headset amplified the frights — where normally I’d have been able to look away, pause the action, or simply take a breather during scary sections, the Rift made hiding my eyes behind my hands impossible. Minimalist puzzle game Torquel needs only to be seen to be understood, but I’ll try using words. You control a square. From the square sprout four rectangular ""legs,"" each color-coded to match the buttons on a PS4 controller. Press X and a strut will shoot from below; Triangle, and one will extend from above. Torque is about using these legs, plus the powers of momentum, physics, and sheer bloody-mindedness, to propel your square to each stage’s exit. It’s a neat, satisfying mechanic, but where Torquel really succeeds is in the way it occasionally rewards moments of brute force alongside precision and finesse. After 10 attempts at a particularly fiendish stage, with a line of interested players forming behind me for their own session, I started slapping buttons at random. Somehow in my frustration I managed to slingshot myself past the spike traps and lethal lava that had killed me on my previous attempts, the game’s physics engine finally taking pity on me for my misunderstanding of fundamental forces. I landed unceremoniously next to the goal like an apologetic canonball and rolled on to the next level. It was much harder. Hidden underneath Forget Me Not: My Organic Garden’s anime-ish aesthetic is a dark heart. And a kidney, and a colon, and a stomach, and something that was maybe a spleen. The player harvests the eponymous organ from a strange garden, using water to make human body parts grow on trees, and plucking them off to earn points. For a game about yanking great globs of viscera as fast as possible, Forget Me Not looks surprisingly clean and clear, making it easy for players to work out when the body parts are ready for harvest by giving them a twinkling effect. More points are earned the faster you work, but Forget Me Not is about resource management as much as it is frantic clicking — your watering can can only be used on a few plants at a time, and shiny bugs, birds, and frogs will come to suck the lifeblood from your otherworldly garden. Once successfully collected, the organs go out front for sale at a strange store, a second side of the game that tracks a relationship between the staff, but doesn’t openly explain why a shop is selling jar after jar of human innards. Developer Cavy House also showed off This Starry Midnight We Make, which uses Japanese esoteric cosmology as a basis for a slow-paced semi-puzzle game. Where Forget Me Not’s garden has players growing lungs and livers, This Starry Midnight We Make entices players to put points of light in a ""basin"" of constellations. Yoshino, director, programmer, and artist at Cavy House, said that the intention was for players to explore the game — which launched on Steam in May — to understand how to play it. Daruma Soul takes Japan’s delightfully grumpy looking Daruma dolls and turns them into health indicators for a frantic vertical shoot-’em-up. You’ll need them, too. You play as a dumpy little ninja, sprinting through haunted forests and along pixelated highways, chucking an endless stream of shurikens at wave after wave of enemies. For enemies that can’t be killed by spinning metal disc — mustachioed tanks carrying sheets of steel, or blank-faced box men with helicopter heads that manage to work their way behind you — a flick of your iPhone’s screen will turn your ninja into a lethal wrecking ball. The touchscreen controls make Daruma Soul feel responsive and precise, making it easy to duck in and out of danger as waves of bullets, rockets, and other projectiles fill the screen. It’s a shame you have to cover a portion of it with your thumb — Daruma Soul is relentlessly characterful and obscenely detailed, blessed with standout pixel art and the kind of buttery smooth animations that are required for such a fast-paced shooter.  The iOS game is the work of Tengu Boys, a duo of developers who call Tokyo home. Unlike a lot of the Japanese developers at Bitsummit, for whom indie games are still a side-project, the boys of Tengu have quit their regular jobs to work full-time on the game. ""It’s slowly becoming easier to become an indie developer in Japan,"" Tengu Boys’ Guuten told me, saying that he hopes to remain independent after Daruma Soul’s release this fall. Where the Tengu Boys were bullish on the everyday realities of life for indies in Japan, the creators of side-scrolling Minecraft-a-like Airship Q were a little more unsure. Kengo Nakajima, Airship Q’s lead programmer and designer, tells me he thinks it’ll be a few years before indies will be able to consistently support themselves in Japan. His game is one of the most polished on the show floor — a block-bashing PlayStation Vita platformer that plays like fellow indie hit Terraria — but Nakajima says he still has to hold down another job, working at Square Enix’s cloud gaming-focused offshoot, Shinra Technologies. The sandbox Airship Q first appealed for money on Japanese crowdfunding site Makuake, before scoring a $680,000 investment from Cygames. The result fuses the kind of mechanics laid down by Minecraft — destroy a block, pick it up, craft things so you can destroy better blocks — with role-playing elements. Players quickly get their hands on their titular airship, and can add various armaments, components, and cabins onto it, building a free-floating vessel ready for a war in the sky. While the game launched in Japan last September, it’s yet to see a release in Europe or North America. The connections to Minecraft and Terraria are obvious, but Nakajima arguably has a claim to be one of this new block-busting genre’s creators — in 2004, he coded Gumonji, a semi-simulation that looked like a proto-Minecraft interbred with online world Second Life. Move or Die feels like a spiritual successor to Nintendo’s party game classic Wario Ware, developed just down the road from Bitsummit itself. The game, built by Romanian developer Those Awesome Guys, offers repeat bursts of short, sharp, and silly action, in which players are given a short countdown and a quick instruction on what to do — pass the bomb; wear the hat, jump on their heads. I joined a group of three strangers already into their first match. We were split by native language and general unfamiliarity, with the game and each other, but two minutes into the experience, we were all audibly groaning or broadly grinning as we traded victories back and forth. Rules are quickly understood and the controls are — a few months from launch — already perfect, offering just the right amount of precision so that your failure feels like it comes at the hands of more skillful opponents. The game's developer is adding an online mode, but as with recent four-player classics like Towerfall, Move or Die will be best enjoyed with three friends crowded around the same PC screen. You’re not the hero in A Healer Only Lives Twice. At least, you’re not the guy with the sword, killing cutesy monsters in a dark dungeon. You’re the guy standing just behind him, offering healing potions and spells to keep him alive as goblins, ghouls, and other blobby monsters take it in turns to strike at various parts of his body. Available on PS Vita and Windows, AHOLT starts slow, giving you ample time to repair your charge’s broken arms and busted-open head before the enemies overwhelm, but it’s not long before huge waves of enemies threaten to kill your friend in a few swipes. To keep my pal healthy, I had to help him out with a few of the tougher monsters. You can’t control your warrior directly, but you can tell him to target specific columns of enemies. I whittled down one goblin who was standing in front of a power-up first, a red bauble that, once collected, let me cast a spell that cleared the board of enemies. At other times, AHOLT demands careful management and forethought. I wasted precious seconds trying to work out if I had the mana to repair my friend’s leg before it snapped — by the time I’d decided, he’d been overwhelmed by the forces of the dark.",0.6286373494526425,0.3713626505473575,0.19183453121310792,2655,4.8809792843691149,1286,6.4712286158631418,0,40,"Culture, Entertainment, Gaming, Report"

Numerous Tweets! Three and a half celebrities! Ed Sheeran doing something stupid!) was many things. One of those things, of course, is ""over."" But we may also eventually look back on it as the event that defined exactly where Girl Squad Feminism falls short. The basics of the exchange (or ""spat,"" or ""feud,"" or ""catfight,"" or whatever dogwhistle language you employ to convey that some hysterical ladies are getting in a tizzy about their feelings) are now the stuff of Internet History. But here's the recap: Minaj felt understandably slighted when her video for ""Anaconda"" — which broke the VEVO record for most views in a single day, and was unavoidable in the fall of 2014 — didn't get a Video of the Year nomination at the VMAs. And, in an error common to any woman with a Twitter account and too much faith in humanity, she took time to explain the problem. ""If I was a different ‘kind' of artist, Anaconda would be nominated for best choreo and vid of the year as well,"" she tweeted. ""When the ‘other' girls drop a video that breaks records and impacts culture they get that nomination."" A ""spat,"" ""feud,"" ""catfight,"" or any other synonym for hysterical ladies in a tizzy ""Other"" means white, of course, and Minaj is not wrong. Out of the five times ""Video of the Year"" has been awarded in this decade, four of the winners have been white: Lady Gaga (2010), Katy Perry (2011), Justin Timberlake (2013), and Miley Cyrus (2014). Twenty-seven acts have been nominated for the award since 2010; two of those nominees have been black women. Minaj could have been talking about Perry, Gaga, Cyrus; hell, she could have been talking about Iggy Azalea, who is white, is not fond of Minaj, and was a 2014 nominee. But, more to the point, she was talking about a pattern of discrimination. Unless, of course, you were Video of the Year nominee Taylor Swift. In that case, Minaj was obviously talking about Video of the Year nominee Taylor Swift. And thus, it began: The accusations of betrayal (""I've done nothing but love & support you""). The allegations that Minaj had broken the compact of sisterhood (""It's unlike you to pit women against each other""). The offer to throw Minaj a bone (""If I win, please come up with me!! You're invited to any stage I'm ever on""). The response came fast and hard, and in its wake, a lot of salient points got drowned in trivialization. (Who unfollowed who? Are we in the midst of a Taylor Swift Backlash? Is Nicki Minaj too angry? Which one is prettier? Fav for ""Minaj,"" RT for ""Swift,"" log off Twitter and go outside for human dignity.) If it wasn't about Swift before she spoke, it was afterward. And there's still something telling about Swift's proposed solution: Taylor gets the award, and Nicki gets to stand next to her, on her stage. Swift's idea of generosity was to offer another woman second place. If it wasn't about Swift before she responded, it is now The image is a familiar one. Swift has positioned herself as a champion for girl power, and a lot of it centers around demonstrating that famous women are friends with Taylor Swift: she brings them on stage at concerts, puts them in videos, and posts their pictures on Instagram, and they receive substantial exposure. She's essentially offering Minaj the same service she's given to Emma Stone and/or the US Women's National Soccer Team. But that solution doesn't work if the problem is that you're tired of being pushed to the sidelines. The message being affirmed, in every photo of Swift's squad, is the centrality of Taylor Swift. The Taylor Swift brand, for all its strengths, has always had an uncomfortable insistence that Swift is, in fact, the Best Girl In The World. Before the days of Squad Goals, feminists were criticizing her for glorifying herself by denigrating women — framing herself as the pure, innocent woman wronged by an overtly sexual, low-class tart, as in ""Better Than Revenge,"" or else setting herself up as an ideal girlfriend, unjustly overlooked in favor of some vapid bimbo, as in ""You Belong With Me."" (Or ""Speak Now,"" or ""Invisible,"" or... you know, pick your song, this was a common theme.) The tone has shifted, but the problem isn't over. The racial appropriation and objectification of black women in the ""Shake It Off"" video is still fresh in our memory, but it's also notable that half the video was Swift mocking other female pop stars. Tina Fey and Amy Poehler have been advocating feminism for two-thirds of Taylor Swift's lifetime, but if they make a joke Swift doesn't like, they're bringing women down. And, as Katy Perry knows, there's a rich vein of irony in the fact that Swift is calling for women to stop fighting, when the very video she's nominated for is entirely about her elaborate preparations to punch another woman in the face. ""Bad Blood"" is reportedly directed at Perry, who brought this on by giving Swift's back-up dancers a better job offer, and who is now clearly having the time of her life with this, as anyone would. ""Better Than Revenge"" subject Camilla Belle also chimed in, and was told to drink bleach for her troubles. And Nicki Minaj very nearly made the hit list by daring to suggest she deserved an award Swift might get. It's not entirely Swift's fault that she's disproportionately hyped: she's white, blonde, thin, was born rich, and has fine, upper-crust manners — all qualities that mainstream America instinctively likes and praises. We refer to a girl like her as ""classy,"" which is really just shorthand for upper-class. We also penalize every girl who doesn't possess these rare, privileged traits — whether she's Beyoncé, Rihanna, Nicki Minaj, or even Katy Perry, who may lack Swift's Emily Post polish, but who also grew up a minister's daughter on food stamps. Swift didn't choose her privileges. But she doesn't have to lean into them, either. Whether intentionally or not, she's set forth a vision of ""feminism"" that can only be enacted by Taylor Swift being the most successful woman in the room, and other women agreeing to play supporting roles in her story — a world where your feminist credentials can be yanked if you differ from her, criticize her, or even seem to value your own career more than hers. Women have meaningful, substantive conflicts, which deserve to be taken seriously I'm acutely aware that I'm a white woman who can be clueless — let she who has not #WhiteFeminist-ed cast the first stone. And, for the record, I think Taylor Swift has said some smart and interesting things in her time, and I'm very aware that some people in this world (sexists) really would like nothing better than an excuse to take her down a peg or demonize her for her success. As you would expect from a star uniquely skilled at being likable, she got the crisis PR right and got it out quick: ""I thought I was being called out. I missed the point, I misunderstood, then misspoke. I'm sorry, Nicki."" Nicki Minaj, who'd been nothing but civil in her interactions with Swift, accepted quickly and graciously. It was all very... friendly.   But not every bad interaction between women is a ""catfight,"" and not every woman is a traitor for not agreeing with everyone she shares a gender with. Women have meaningful, substantive conflicts, which deserve to be taken seriously. The problem Nicki Minaj pointed out is not an opinion, or a complaint: it's a matter of numbers. It's one in five and two in 27. For feminism to move ahead, those numbers need to change — which they cannot do, if we have only one Best Girl.",0.5049429540656354,0.4950570459343646,0.1655420306024157,1331,4.7535687453042827,675,5.9703703703703708,0,0,"Culture, Entertainment, Essay, Music"

The show's second season is set to take place in Sydney, a major shift from the first season's rural New Zealand setting. Campion will be writing and directing the show in conjunction with writer Gerard Lee and a co-director who hasn't been named yet. It wasn't always clear that Top of the Lake would have a second season at all, much less one with Moss at its front. Speaking to Newsweek in 2013, a few days before the first season's premiere, Campion said there wouldn't be another season whatsoever. Her writing pen backed that sentiment up: Top of the Lake's first run more or less resolved its plot, which centered around the disappearance of a 12-year-old girl from a small, troubled community. A year and a half later, it was announced that Campion and Lee were putting together another bundle of episodes. It's hard to say whether the heaps of recognition the series received — five Emmy nominations and a win at the Golden Globes for Moss' work — had any impact on Campion's decision to run it back. Either way, Moss' return to Campion's world is just another reason to get excited for one of TV's most precise, idiosyncratic young series.

The film, First They Killed My Father, will be released in late 2016 in both English and Khmer. Jolie will direct and produce the movie, based on a script she co-wrote with Loung Ung, author of the book First They Killed My Father: A Daughter of Cambodia Remembers. Loung was a child when the Khmer Rouge came to power in Cambodia, where nearly two million people were killed during the four-year regime. Loung was sent to train as a child soldier at a work camp for orphans, while her siblings were sent to labor camps. ""hard to watch but important to see."" Loung met Jolie in 2001, one year after the writer's memoir was published.

Coin, the buzzy but troubled company whose signature product seeks to replace your credit cards with a single piece of plastic, will begin shipping the second version of its card today. Coin 2.0 includes an NFC chip to enable contactless payments. It has newly refined refined sensors for improved swiping, particularly outdoors, where variations in temperature and humidity often caused the card to fail. The card is thinner than its predecessor at 0.8 millimeters, and allows you to create short nicknames for your cards. And for the early buyers of the card, who waited nearly a year and a half to start receiving their devices after a successful crowdfunding campaign, there’s a bonus: everyone who has ever purchased a Coin gets version 2.0 for free. (If you’ve bought yours and it hasn’t shipped yet, this means you, too.) ""We’re working really hard to reinforce how important our users are to us,"" says Kanishk Parashar, the company’s founder and CEO. ""We’re trying to ship more and more valuable functionality to them as soon as we can."" ""We're working really hard to reinforce how important our users are to us."" ""As soon we can"" has often proved to be later than Coin’s backers hoped. The card was met with great enthusiasm when it was announced in November 2013, with more than 20,000 people pre-ordering Coin at a discounted price of $55. At the time, the company said the device would ship in the summer of 2014. But when the summer came, Coin said the device would only be available in a limited beta — and that anyone who opted in to the beta would have to buy a new Coin when it came out for real the following spring.   The company backtracked two days later, apologizing for attempting to change the terms of its deal with crowdfunders. It finally began shipping version 1.0 this spring, but has continued to be dogged by criticisms that it simply doesn’t work as advertised. In 2014, the company said Coin worked in 85 percent of US locations. A year later, the company says it works in … 85 percent of US locations. More delays ahead And there are more delays to be found in the 2.0 update. The company says it will take until the first quarter of next year before it ships upgraded cards to all of the original buyers. And the NFC chip is in ""early access mode,"" with Coin declining to specify which or how cards might work with the feature when it ships. Coin has shipped more than 80,000 devices to date, and inspired a raft of similar would-be universal credit cards: Swyp, Plastc, and Stratos are among the best known. There’s clearly an appetite for a universal card, at least among early adopters. But I’m still not convinced a universal card is worth the $100 or so it will cost you, even at version 2.0. A debit card works almost anywhere, requires no battery, and will be replaced by most banks for free. And if you’re looking for a device that stores multiple cards and has NFC that already works with most major credit cards, check your existing smartphone: Apple Pay has you covered; Samsung Pay is coming next month; and Android Pay is expected to launch soon to cover other Android devices.  Coin and its rivals have gotten a long way thanks to their sleek plastics and flashy marketing videos. But it’s hard not to feel like they’ve been built for a present day that is receding rapidly into the past. Parashar says banks are eager to work with Coin because they want their payment network to power a broad ecosystem of devices. (Better that than see a single new solution, such as Apple Pay, come to dominate transactions — and reduce their negotiating power.) But until banks start subsidizing the cost of Coin for customers — heck, until Coin enables NFC payments for all the major banks — it’s all just talk. And if you’ve been following Coin’s story for this long, you could be forgiven for deciding that you’ve heard enough.",0.6082362582759154,0.39176374172408457,0.21898074937244635,695,4.6992805755395679,363,5.8126721763085403,0,2,"Mobile, Tech, Report"

Underground gathers and displays apps and games that are ""actually free"" as Amazon calls it — with no hidden costs like in-app purchases. Amazon says users of Underground have access to over $10,000 in free apps and in-app purchases through Underground that would normally cost them if purchased through Amazon's regular Appstore. But unless you are one of the hundreds of people still using the Fire Phone, it's still a pain for most people to install any apps from the Amazon Appstore on an Android device.   To keep you from paying the in-app fees some of the apps and games in Underground routinely charge, Amazon has worked out a deal with developers where it pays them on a per-minute played basis. Apps like Star Wars Rebels: Recon Missions and Angry Birds Slingshot Stella are now totally free in Amazon Underground. The success of Amazon Underground depends entirely on the quality of the free apps it will offer Due to Google Play Store rules, you can't download Amazon Underground through the app store, so you must head to Amazon's website if you want the new app, and jump through a few hoops to get it installed on your Android device. This has been the biggest hindrance (besides a lack of content in comparison to Google Play) to success for Amazon's Appstore — very few people want to deal with he hassle of changing security settings and installing an .apk to access content that is largely available in the Google Play Store already. Whether Amazon Underground can change that mentality will largely depend on the quality of content it offers for free in its Appstore. Amazon also got rid of its Free App of the Day, according to Gadgtspot, which is likely related to the launch of Underground. With an entire section dedicated to promoting completely free apps, it looks like Amazon has found a nice way to drop its daily free app program.

On mobile, it's closer to an afterthought. Adobe has been trying to change that over the past couple years as it rolls out more and more free mobile apps that break out some of its most impressive desktop features. Now, it's taking another crack at bringing a single powerful editing tool to mobile. Adobe intends to make it powerful but easy to use According to CNET, Adobe is working on a new Photoshop-branded app for the iPhone and iPad that'll be introduced as a free app this October, with an Android version coming later. The app should include many powerful and commonly used features from desktop Photoshop — like content-aware fill and spot healing — but it's supposed to make them much more accessible, so that people just getting into image editing can start to use them. In part, that's about figuring out how to bring these tools to a touch interface, but it's also as simple as renaming tools like ""dodge"" and ""burn"" to ""lighten"" and ""darken."" Adobe actually previewed some of these tools back in May:  There will also be a lot going on under the hood. CNET reports that Adobe is bringing a face recognition tool to this mobile app — something that isn't in desktop Photoshop — that'll allow people to quickly adjust different facial features. And while the app may treat edited photos like a flat image, it'll apparently be saving edits into separate layers that can be synced back to the desktop. That could let existing Photoshop users do a bit of work on the go, while giving people who get hooked on this new app a reason to subscribe to Creative Cloud. Adobe has tried its hand at a mobile Photoshop before, with Photoshop Touch, but that app was recently discontinued. CNET's report makes it sound like this new tool could take its place as Adobe's mobile star. That said, Adobe has acknowledged that most people use focused, single-purpose apps on mobile — it's much easier to pop into an app dedicated to applying filters or framing photos than digging for those tools in a giant editor — so this app may still be positioned as a step up for people who are looking to do a bit more with photo editing than they're used to.",0.6551841698248106,0.34481583017518935,0.16777236319921118,398,4.6155778894472359,218,5.4954128440366974,0,0,"Apple, Mobile, Photography, Tech"

Because of the technology and wireless frequencies that Verizon uses, devices that are designed for other carriers may not work as well when hooked up to Verizon.

To prevent automated errors, a team of Facebook's own contractors, known as M Trainers, are responsible for pushing M's most powerful features through and booking actual reservations, buying products, and so on. But the artificial intelligence at play seems significant, with M responding to your initial queries with follow-up questions and updates as tasks move towards completion. And if you're worried about privacy or creepy factor, for now M isn't pulling from your Facebook history to complete any of its functions. This might eventually change though — with permission.

By detecting the location and movement of your fingers in space — right on down to using the doppler effect to detect speed — you can enable rich interactions. If the science works, it becomes a problem of defining the ""vocabulary"" of movements. Sliding your thumb against your finger could scroll, tapping them together could select, a flick could dismiss. ATAP is also approaching the problem of interaction bandwidth by providing a larger surface area using touch-sensitive fabric.

While it's difficult to compare exact figures between Windows 10 and Windows 8, Microsoft ""sold"" 40 million licenses of Windows 8 a month after its debut. It took Microsoft six months to get to 100 million licenses of Windows 8, and it's clear the free aspect of Windows 10 is obviously driving higher adoption rates.

Parents who were physically abused as kids aren’t more likely to be violent with their own kids, according to the first large-scale, long-term study of child abuse published in Science yesterday. The finding contradicts aspects of the ""cycle of violence"" theory, which suggests that children who endure physical violence as children go on to perpetrate those same behaviors on their own children. That said, parents who had experienced neglect or sexual abuse as kids were more likely to have kids who experienced the same problems, according to the study. Trigger warning: childhood sexual abuse, neglect, physical abuse ""People shouldn’t assume that all parents with histories of abuse and neglect will abuse their kids,"" says Cathy Widom, a psychologist at City University of New York. ""It’s not inevitable."" The majority of people who have histories of physical abuse don't replicate these behaviors with their own kids. ""People shouldn’t assume that all parents with histories of abuse and neglect will abuse their kids."" The study is more comprehensive than its predecessors; gathering the data took close to 30 years. ""I began research on what is now referred to as ‘the cycle of violence’ in the late 1980s,"" Widom says. In 1986, she launched a study that asked if childhood abuse lead to an increase in risk for delinquency, crime, and violence. ""I decided that I would get documented cases of abuse and neglect — court cases for children between the ages of zero and 11 — so I could establish the temporal relationship between abuse and neglect and these outcomes."" She ended up recruiting 900 kids through these court cases, which took place between 1967 and 1971. Then, Widom matched these kids with 600 other children who weren’t documented victims of abuse, but who lived in the same neighborhoods and went to same schools. To find out whether abuse is transmitted through generations, the researchers interviewed these children, now adults, when they were about 29 years old. Widom and her team contacted them again when they turned 47. By then, about half of the participants decided that they didn’t want to take part in the study anymore. During that second round of interviews, the researchers also got in touch with their kids — adults in their early 20s — and used Child Protective Services reports to fill in the gaps. The findings indicate that parents who suffered physical abuse during their childhoods aren't more likely to be violent toward their children, compared with the parents who hadn't been physically abused as kids. That doesn't mean that abuse isn't transmitted at all, however. Parents who had experienced neglect or sexual abuse  as kids were more likely to have kids who experienced the same problems, according to the study. ""increased risk for sexual abuse and neglect, not physical abuse."" ""Child Protective Service reports show that the offspring of parents with histories of abuse and neglect are at increased risk for sexual abuse and neglect, but not physical abuse,"" Widow said. And the offspring reports — reports from the second generation of kids involved in the study — were consistent with that finding. It's still an open question who was responsible for the neglect or sexual abuse — the study didn't examine that. What it does show is a general increase in risk for the children of victims. ""We, as researchers, need to do more work as to why,"" Widom says. ""And practitioners need to consider that it’s not necessarily people with histories of physical abuse that are passing abuse onto their kids."" ""bias when families are previously known to the system.""  The study also provides evidence for a child abuse reporting bias. Parents who were abused as children were two and a half times as likely to be reported to child protective services for physical violence compared with parents in the comparison group who admitted to physically abusing their kids, or whose children said they had suffered physical abuse. ""This does suggest that there is in fact some type of bias when families are previously known to the system,"" Patricia Kohl, a social scientist at Washington University in St. Louis, told Science Magazine. Of course, it’s also possible that parents who were physically abused as kids are harder on their kids, making the maltreatment easier to detect — but that question is beyond the scope of the study. The fact that this study spans 30 years is unusual. Instead of asking young adults and parents about their abuse histories during a single interview, the researchers checked in with the first generation of study participants more than once over the course of three decades. Moreover, the study didn’t rely solely on what the parents and kids were willing to talk about. ""We have clear cases of abuse and neglect in the parent generation not just based on self-report,"" Widom says. Despite these improvements, the study doesn’t give a complete picture of child abuse in the US. For example, the majority of kids that Widom recruited in the late '80s came from low-income households. This is unfortunately pretty typical for these kind of studies. Because recruitment tends to rely court cases and child protective services reports, higher-income households — households that don't come into contact with social workers very often — are rarely included. In addition, the kids that Widom studied in the '80s all grew up in the Midwest, so the population isn't representative of the entire country. They moved around a lot as they grew up — ""the people are now in over 40 states,"" Widom says —  but that isn't enough to make up for the geographical sampling effect. Finally, children who were adopted were excluded from the study altogether. ""This was the hardest thing that I’ve ever done."" ""There are things that I wished that we could have done better, but the reality is that this is just very difficult. That’s why nobody has ever done it before,"" Widom says. ""This was the hardest thing that I’ve ever done."" Wisdom and her team aren’t done working on the data they’ve gathered. ""We know from my earlier work that people who were physically abused as a child go on to have a higher likelihood of being violent when they get older,"" Widom says, ""but we don’t know why they do not appear to be violent toward their own offspring."" Evolutionary biologists might suggest that this has something to do with wanting to protect a child with whom you share your genes, Widom says. But if that were the case, one might expect the protection imparted by shared genes to extend to neglect and sexual abuse as well. The researchers also plan to look at other factors that might be involved in the intergenerational transmission of abuse, like genetics, drug use, alcohol abuse, social isolation, and mental health disorders. Even though the study took three decades to complete, it's just a starting point, Widom says.  ""We can ask all those other questions now; everyone in my team is sort of chomping at the bit to do that.""",0.346652569041235,0.653347430958765,0.8307691465270204,1180,4.9974576271186439,501,6.1776447105788419,0,0,"Science, Report"

The company's vice president of engineering, Jay Parikh, told The Wall Street Journal that Facebook is planning ""a real test flight"" of its solar-powered internet drone this summer. A smaller version of the drone, one tenth the size of the planned product, was tested earlier this month. The scheduled test flight would be the first time the full-sized internet drone — called Aquila — will take to the skies. Facebook says the vehicle will have the wingspan of a commercial passenger jet and the length of ""six or seven [Toyota] Priuses,"" but will only weigh as much as four car tires. The lightweight build should help the craft stay flying for weeks, months, or years at a time, using solar energy to keep itself aloft. Google, also in the process of developing its own internet-proliferation project, is using a different approach. The company's Project Loon uses a swarm of balloons to disseminate broadband to unconnected portions of the world. The technology to build the Aquila drone didn't exist a year ago Parikh said the solar and battery technology used to power the drone has only just been developed, telling The Wall Street Journal that the hardware available a year ago when the project was announced ""wasn't good enough for what we're trying to do with this plane."" Facebook is also yet to secure deals with internet carriers to beam signal to the 1.1 to 2.8 billion people without internet today. When asked if Facebook would develop its own service to compete with global wireless carriers, Parikh said it would go against the company's ""core mission.""I think it would take a lot longer if we were going to do it all by ourselves,"" he told The Wall Street Journal. ""It would take a lot of money and I don't think it's sustainable long-term."" Private companies such as Facebook are at the bleeding edge of drone research, but regulations aren't keeping pace with the speed of development. Facebook executives have warned that the project is unlikely to be finalized any time soon, specifying that the firm needed to ensure the safety of the drones while also locking down relationships with carriers.

Last year, a single 55-gallon drum of waste material was found to have burst its seams at the New Mexico Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP), dispersing radioactive material throughout the underground facility. The drum had been packed with organic rather than inorganic kitty litter, which led to ""a series of ever-increasing heat releasing reactions"" that breached the drum. Although this scenario sounds far-fetched, kitty litter has been used to stabilize certain types of nuclear waste for decades. However, only inorganic litter contains the mineral silicates needed for the job. The substance itself is not used to ""dry out"" the waste, but actually stabilizes it before it dries out. As WIPP geologist Jim Conca explained last year: ""‘Green’ cat litter [is] made with materials like wheat or corn. These organic litters do not have the silicate properties needed to chemically stabilize nitrate the correct way."" the incorrect use of ""swheat scoop"" kitty litter has led to $243 million in damages According to the report, the ""Swheat Scoop"" brand of organic kitty litter was used to package drum 68660. As a result of the ensuing breach, 21 workers were contaminated with low-level doses of radiation and WIPP itself was completely shut down. The White House has requested $243 million in its 2016 budget to bring the plant back into operation, with US energy secretary Ernest Moniz commenting: ""Bringing this facility back online is a very high priority and we believe we are on schedule to resume operations in about a year."" Speaking to The Verge about the incident last year, Conca commented: ""Everything nuclear is proceduralized. It’s well laid out and everything everyone does is supposed to go up and down the chain of command.

Interviews with scientists, historians, and people battling disease bring the viewer into a world of scientific triumphs, and devastating failures — all of which are punctuated with colorful animations, and archival photographs that help Siddhartha Mukherjee's Pulitzer-winning book come alive.  We spoke with the documentary's director, Barak Goodman, about the making of the PBS documentary, which will air in three parts, starting Monday. The following is a lightly edited transcript of that conversation.  How much did you know about cancer before starting this documentary? I knew very little. I knew what most people know, that it is a disease of unrestrained growth of cells, and I had the feeling that very little progress had been made in the fight against cancer, and that it was still nearly as deadly or as deadly a disease as it had been — all of which are wrong. Cancer is ""our Malevolent evil twin."" So it looks like your perception of cancer changed. How exactly did it change? Well, in every way. First of all, I learned that it is many diseases, not one disease. It's a family of diseases, and not all are nearly as fearsome as the rest. There are many kinds of cancers that are now highly treatable, and many others that will be treatable and containable within the forceable future. So, in general I think it became much less scary than it had been. I think, also, as I learned about the science of cancer — Sid talks about this in the book — [I realized that] it's really our malevolent evil twin. It's so much ""us,"" and not ""other."" It's not a pathogen that comes from the outside. In a twisted way, cancer is a perfection of our own drive to survive and to live. That was a very big surprise to me. It explains why it's so difficult to treat. It's so close to who we are. The final thing is about progress. Contrary to what I thought,  there has been incredible progress made against cancer, especially in the last 10 years. That was a real surprise to me, and something that I hope we can get across to our viewers. One of the big differences between the book and the documentary is the importance of contemporary cancer stories. Why did you decide to emphasize people's experiences with cancer in the 21st century? Well, it's partly about the difference between television and books. What Sid has the ability to do in his book is write himself in and out of stories and take large digressions into other stories. A book allows you to do things that television, within the confines of time, doesn't allow you to do. On the other hand, what television can do that books don't do as well is press your face right against the glass of cancer. I wanted to avail myself of the power of television, to put people right into these stories. We knew how challenging this would be, trying to interweave history, contemporary stories, and the science — nothing like this had ever been really tried before. And it really ended up working so much better than I imagined. A big chunk of the documentary is spent telling stories about families battling cancer, and to do that, you had to follow them around for quite some time. How did that play out? We made a decision right upfront that we wanted the film to invest heavily in contemporary cases studies, more so than in Sid's book. And we decided that rather than going around the country cherry-picking stories here and there, we would imbed ourselves in two hospitals and really become a part of the ecosystem of these hospitals, so that we could get very close to the doctors and nurses on the front line, and through them, to their patients. We thought that this was the only way that we would get close enough to get beyond the surface of these stories. ""our camera was like the IV pump next to them, and the machine in the corner. It was just another feature of their world there."" So, we got wonderful cooperation from two hospitals, Johns Hopkins in Baltimore and The Charleston Area Medical Center in West Virginia. We sent field producers down to live in those places, and to be in the hospital hallways every single day. And that really paid off hugely. When we did meet families, those families knew that the doctors and nurses approved of us, that we had been there for a long time, and it just made everyone much more comfortable with the whole thing, and I think you see that with the final product.  You see how intimate these stories are, how close we got to our subjects, and how unguarded they are in front of the camera. And that's because our camera was like the IV pump next to them, and the machine in the corner. It was just another feature of their world there.   Did you encounter any problems with families saying, ""hey we don't want to participate anymore?"" Inevitably. There is always that moment where the sort of initial rush of it has worn off, and sometimes it happens when things in their lives aren't going well. That presents a dilemma for us as filmmakers because we want to respect the wishes of our subjects. On the other hand, sometimes these things pass very quickly. So, it requires a lot of tact.  There was precisely one moment — the story of Lucas, the boy we were following who gets very sick — where we struggled with whether or not to follow him as he got sicker and sicker. We discussed the possibility of him dying and [whether we] would be there. Ultimately, we decided that wasn't a line that we wanted to cross. I had seen other films that had those kinds of scenes, and I always found them incredibly distasteful and over the line. And, you know, we knew that the family was uncomfortable at that point, but we didn't even need to know that. We ourselves were uncomfortable intruding on those kinds of moments. So, we took it to a point where we saw Lucas when he was seriously ill, but we did not film any of the last several months of his life, when he got sicker and sicker. That was a very conscious choice on our part. ""We discussed the possibility of him dying and [whether we] would be there."" In the first episode, the documentary recounts the first time researchers realized that you could use a chemical to treat cancer. The treatment was used in a three-year-old boy with Leukemia, and you got the boy's twin brother, Elliott, to talk about that experience. How do you make that story as vivid as possible? Well, fortunately he made it quite vivid. The fact that he could remember with such clarity events that happened so long ago... I guess it's evidence of how scalding they were. So the first thing is just to use Elliot's own memories, which were so powerful. But then we brought in every other technique. We had wonderful archival [materials] of the young [scientist] Robert Sandler, and then we availed ourselves of certain animation techniques. We created a sort of whimsical animation to capture their childlike view of their childhood in Dorchester, Massachusetts. Then we kind of turned that on its head, when Elliot describes the corridors where his brother laid ill. Instead of the colorful whimsy of the first part, you have this cold black and white, with these ghostly images of the hallway, of parents and of doctors. ""The basic research dollars have to come from the Federal government and they're not."" That was very consciously the before and after of a child getting sick. And then we turned to animation again to show [the boy's] death. We used every tool in the tool shed. What do you hope viewers will get from this documentary? I hope that they will get exactly what I got in making it. First of all, a more nuanced understanding of what these diseases really are. And how the word isn't as terrifying anymore. It may be as terrifying, but it shouldn't be. Something like 60 percent of newly diagnosed cases will be ""cured"" or ""contained,"" and people will live a normal live. That's a pretty encouraging statistic, and it's getting better every year. So first and foremost hope is what we hope will happen. And secondly, we hope that the film will help to galvanize a national conversation about cancer, so that the federal government, which has cut funding for basic research in the last few years, will restore it. Because until the last few years there was a bipartisan consensus that basic research for cancer should be funded fully. And that has stopped for the first time as we've gotten involved in these budget wars in Washington. It's really so tragic because it is the moment in time right now when we need funding for basic research. We are right on the cusp of many breakthroughs, and what we need is just to get over the hump, and that requires the partnership of the federal government. No one else will do it. Pharmaceutical companies won't do it. Private philanthropy tends to focus on results, so they tend to focus on therapies. The basic research dollars have to come from the Federal government, and they're not. So we hope that this will help people get on their politicians and correct that problem.

Robotic surgery can refer to machines that act autonomously, but it frequently means tools that surgeons can ""pilot"" from a computer screen. It can also significantly add to the cost of surgery, and one of the most popular surgical robots has been accused of underreporting accidents to the FDA, which launched an investigation in 2013. But ideally, it can provide fine-grained controls in hard-to-reach areas, especially as technology advances. Here, Johnson & Johnson describes it as ""a type of minimally invasive surgery that uses technology to give surgeons greater control, access and accuracy during the surgical procedure while benefitting patients by minimizing trauma and scarring."" This partnership is a new development for Google, but the company has previously shown interest in medical initiatives. Besides launching its Google Fit health data service last year, it partnered with the pharmaceutical company AbbVie to help develop new drugs for cancer and other age-related diseases — all part of its ultimate moonshot goal of ""curing death."" Its wearable platform and web services give it access to huge amounts of health data; competitor Apple recently started using similar resources for medical testing.

However, when they tipped the animal out onto a sheet of plastic the next morning to be photographed, they saw that its skin was entirely smooth. They were disappointed, and assumed they'd picked up the wrong frog by mistake. ""I then put the frog back in the cup and added some moss,"" says Katherine, a PhD student at Case Western Reserve University in Ohio. ""The spines came back... we simply couldn't believe our eyes, our frog changed skin texture! I put the frog back on the smooth white background [and] its skin became smooth.""  Pristimantis mutabilis before and after its transformation. (ASA) The Krynaks had discovered what is believed to be the first known amphibian with ability to change the texture of its skin. The frog has been named Pristimantis mutabilis or the mutable rainfrog, and is described for the first time as a new species in the most recent issue of the Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society. It takes just five minutes for its skin to change texture, and Katherine says the unusual ability probably helps the frog hide from birds and predators in Reserva Las Gralarias, the Ecaudorian nature reserve where the frog was found and where the Krynaks both volunteer. ""the spines and coloration help them blend in."" ""The spines and coloration help them blend into mossy habitats, making it hard for us to see them,"" said Katherine in a press release from Case Western University. ""But whether the texture really helps them elude predators still needs to be tested."" It's also not clear how exactly mutabilis changes its skin texture. Pristimantis mutabilis isn't a lone mutant though. After the frog was documented back in 2009, researchers working at the same reserve discovered that Prismantis sobetes, a previously known species and a relative of mutabilis, had the same ability. A spiny member of the species was observed turning smooth when placed on a sheet to be photographed, and researchers are now wondering how many frog species have been wrongly classified thanks to this shape-shifting ability. The Pristimantis genus, for example, contains over 470 species. It's possible that some of these are actually the same frog discovered twice.",0.38448938524134646,0.6155106147586535,0.8767116324186434,448,4.9620535714285712,257,5.6809338521400781,0,2,Science

The findings provide a more comprehensive perspective on how warming oceans have reduced ice volume, though it's difficult to say how soon sea levels could rise as a result. The study, published in the journal Science, measures the thickness of Antarctica's ice shelves — floating sheets of ice that extend from glaciers out into the ocean. Using satellite radar data collected from 1994 to 2012, the authors found that ice shelves melted steadily in West Antarctica over the 18-year period, with losses accelerating by 70 percent after 2003. That’s significant because ice shelves play an important role in limiting how fast Antarctica’s glaciers melt, thereby limiting the rate at which sea levels rise. ""The ice shelf acts like a plug at the end of the glacier,"" says Laurie Padman, senior scientist at the Earth and Space Research institute and one of the study’s co-authors. ""like a plug at the end of the glacier."" Melting ice shelves alone don’t significantly contribute to rising sea levels, since they’re already floating, but it’s the land ice behind them that pose the greatest danger. ""If you thin those ice shelves or remove that ice completely, then the glaciers behind them can lose ice more quickly than they are now,"" Padman says. Previous studies have shown that ice shelf volume in West Antarctica has declined in recent years, and that shrinking ice shelves can speed up glacier melting on the continent. But most cover large regions and relatively short time periods. Experts describe today’s study as the most comprehensive yet. ""We knew that things were accelerating in Antarctica,"" says Ted Scambos, lead scientist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center, who was not involved in the study. ""What it’s done, thoroughly and accurately, is to merge all of the useful data together so we have a much better picture of the time scale that certain areas respond to changes in the ocean… It gives us a better picture, but it's not a brand new picture.""  The study, co-authored by researchers from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, also sheds light on important regional variations across Antarctica. For the first 10 years, West Antarctica’s losses were largely offset by gains in East Antarctica, which is less exposed to warm ocean waters and saw increased snowfall over that period. But the eastern region stopped gaining ice after 2003, speeding overall loss of Antarctic ice. Some ice shelves lost as much as 18 percent of their volume over the 18-year period, suggesting that they would completely disappear within this century, if current trends continue. Rising sea levels would be the most immediate result of any rapid decline in ice shelf volume, though it's too soon to say when or how that would happen. Under certain scenarios, global sea levels could rise by several meters, but Scambos says further satellite data and ocean measurements are needed to get a fuller picture. ""The real question is not whether sea level is going to rise,"" he says. ""It’s what rate sea level is going to rise at."" ""the last 20 years... is not a guarantee of future changes."" Padman and his co-authors caution that their findings shouldn’t be extrapolated too far into the future. To do so would require reliable climate models to predict changes in the ocean and atmosphere around Antarctica, and a greater understanding of what’s driving the decline in ice shelf volume. They suggest that some of the most rapid ice loss is due to stronger winds that blow warm water into the western part of the continent, but it’s not clear why that’s happening. Without knowing the cause for these trends, forecasting the next 100 years remains a daunting task. ""It all really depends on how the ocean and the atmosphere around Antarctica changes during that time,"" Padman says. ""So the last 20 years of performance is not a guarantee of future changes.""",0.6841135655214039,0.3158864344785961,0.6292775974546142,680,5.0117647058823529,380,5.9500000000000002,0,0,"Science, Report"

You get into a real (but stationary) car, put on a head-mounted display, and steer your way down a virtual highway. Slowly, irritations build up: loud music, ringing phones, your friend trying to make you read a text message. Look away, and you crash.  Driving simulators are increasingly common, and like flight sims before them, they can train people to make split-second decisions without the heavy consequences of failure. Usually, this involves flat screens that simulate car windows. The Rift's head tracking makes it an inspired choice here, since Toyota can actually tell if you're not paying attention to the road. The immersion reduces distractions from the outside and can create a sense of urgency — even, in a crash, fear.

The legal notice names Rasier LLC, which is a subsidiary of Uber and operates its UberX service, saying that the company's drivers simply don't have the right credentials to be picking people up and taking them places for money.

Uber's been in South Carolina for nearly seven months Uber has been operating its UberX service in the state since July of last year. Local regulators have been contemplating a special new classification for Uber and other services like it. A hearing to discuss the matter was originally set for later this month, but was halted after Uber surprised officials by filing to have its service certified to operate like other taxi and limousine services. ""Despite working closely with the PSC for the past several months on a permanent solution for Uber in South Carolina, today’s actions are unexpected and not reflective of the progress made thus far,"" an Uber spokesperson said in a statement.

Robert Fischer, Metro’s systems project manager, told the Daily News the project's contract was awarded nearly two years ago, but security fears and concerns about interfering with radio communication among first-responders delayed the project. Metro’s contractor, InSite Wireless, LLC, will bring Wi-Fi and cell service to four Red Line stations — Westlake, Wilshire / Western, Wilshire / Vermont, and Vermont / Sunset — before extending service to North Hollywood, and then to Pasadena and East LA on the Gold Line. The project will take an estimated $800,000 and two years to complete. The small, much-maligned Metro is the most recent US city subway system to offer Wi-Fi and cell service.

Italian design firm T°RED in collaboration with the energy research institution Ricerca Sistema Energetico created e-QBO, a customizable, modular cube that collects energy from the sun to provide power to public spaces. During the day, the panels soak up sunlight and store energy in battery packs, which can then be used by anyone to charge electronic devices and provide Wi-Fi.   e-QBO powers public spaces and expands upon them The design is essentially a square made from wood and steel with solar panels and LED lights on the exterior, but it can be expanded or minimized depending on how many solar panels are used to make it. Each PV panel is one square meter, so the block can be made small enough for people to sit on, or large enough to become an inhabitable space. Creatively applying solar panels isn't new — designers have found ways to stick panels on nearly any surface and make beautiful objects that harvest solar energy. But e-QBO does something different by creating a new public space while powering the one it already sits in. And Erica Marson, vice president and general manager at T°RED, told The Atlantic Cities that it takes little effort to install one just about anywhere. This means an e-QBO could be installed for a few weeks for a specific event and the dismantled and move somewhere else. With a 5 x 5 cube costing $150,000, it might be a bit steep for one-time use, but cities could potentially invest in one and move it from place to place.  Since the first e-QBO prototype was built last year, T°RED has installed others in various locations like Piazza San Fedele in Milan and an archaeological site in Sicily. The design got a lot of attention at last month's World Future Energy Summit in Abu Dhabi, and the Italian city of Piacenza has ordered an e-QBO to potentially use as an information hub for its Expo 2015.

For over a year, Whyte has been shooting what he calls the ""Legography"" series, starring a Lego minifig with a bulky black camera and a penchant for exploration. The minifig travels with Whyte, waiting to be posed scaling a fence, watching the sunrise, or playing tourist in London. In order to allow for some portability and spontaneity, the Legography series is shot on an iPhone, initially the 4S and now the 5S. Whyte uses the app 645 Pro to get more manual control over his shots than the default camera software would allow, then processes them in Snapseed before uploading them to the Legography Facebook page. ""As an exploration of mobile photography, the project was very enlightening and quite liberating — to know I could be just about anywhere and still keep on top of things,"" says Whyte. The rest of his photography can be found at Long Exposures.  ""Having reviewed my archives, this took 19 attempts to capture the camera drop in the right position.""

That's the question that was posed to architects and artists as part of a competition for a dual-site memorial commemorating the attacks in Norway on July 22nd, 2011. On that day, 77 people were killed, eight by an Oslo car bomb and 69 in a massacre at a youth event on the island of Utøya. After holding an open competition, Norway has decided to install a pair of memorials designed by Swedish artist Jonas Dahlberg to pay tribute to those who lost their lives in the attacks. As Bustler reports, Dahlberg's proposal for an Utøya memorial is at once simple and striking. An 11-foot (3.5 meter) cut will be made in the nearby headland at Tyrifjorden, forever separating it from the mainland with the water that now surrounds it. This cut represents the loss of life caused by the attack by literally removing a chunk of the country's land and figuratively carving an unhealable wound into its landscape. Visitors to the memorial, which is titled Memory Wound, will by guided down a pathway through the island's forest into a tunnel that leads to the wound. The tunnel ends abruptly at the cut, where visitors will be able to see to the other side. Opposite this viewing window will be the names of all those who lost their lives on July 22nd. ""The names will be close enough to see and read clearly,"" explains Dahlberg, ""yet ultimately out of reach. This cut is an acknowledgement of what is forever irreplaceable."" The earth, plants, and trees removed through excavating the cut will be transferred to Oslo, where it will act as the foundation for the city's memorial. The Oslo tribute comprises a contemplative path situated alongside an existing busy walkway. The memorial will take visitors off their regular path but ultimately lead them in the right direction. It speaks to the massive impact the attacks had on the everyday lives of Norwegians, but concludes that although we should take time to remember what happened, life must carry on. Memory Wound will be an 11-foot wide cut through headland near the island of Utøya. Visitors to the memorial will be able to walk inside the headland through a short tunnel. Opposite the viewing area, the victims' names will be viewable, but out of reach. Earth and trees from the cut will be transported to Oslo to form the foundation of a separate monument.

Perhaps not, but the company is betting that at least some people will. Its Apple Watch Edition is made from 18-karat gold and will likely be very expensive — think thousands of dollars expensive — despite offering little to no extra functionality over the aluminum and steel models. Who would pay for such a thing? Well, just ask Vertu.  A British manufacturer of ultra-premium phones, Vertu is the first nominally ""tech"" company to acknowledge the market for luxury electronics. It’s one of the first tech companies to understand that people don’t buy $4,000 Hermès handbags to improve their ability to carry things. (Leica is another.) Apple may have the high end of the conventional smartphone market almost to itself, but the Apple Watch Edition will be marketed to a well-heeled demographic of technology users that Vertu understands all too well. ""These are people that will never even consider a watch that uses aluminum,"" says creative director Ignacio Germade of Vertu’s clientele. ""Our customers aren’t satisfied with plastic or aluminum or a product that has Gorilla Glass. They want something that matches the rest of the products that they own. If they have sapphire on their watch, they want to have sapphire on their phone."" Vertu was founded as Nokia’s luxury arm but is now an independent venture after being spun off in 2012. The company makes several-thousand-dollar phones from lavish materials, each hand-assembled by a single worker who engraves their signature on every device. And by all accounts, Vertu turns a profit on these phones. Often a laughing stock of the technology industry, which finds it hard to comprehend any purchasing decision that isn’t based on the price-to-performance ratio, Vertu is actually well ahead of its time. As technology gets commoditized year on year, and brands like Samsung find it harder to stand out against the onslaught of cheaper products that offer most of the same experience, it’s the high end of the market with the most potential to thrive and differentiate. Despite the high-profile hiring of fashion industry figures such as Angela Ahrendts and Paul Deneve, the iPhone 5S tie-up with Burberry last year, and the Apple Watch’s presence on the cover of Vogue China along with its preview event at the Colette boutique in Paris, Tim Cook spoke in October of the Watch’s warm reception from ""people who know a lot about fashion and style."" To read the subtext, Apple still doesn’t consider itself among those people. Just this week 9to5Mac reported that the company is actively attempting to hire fashion-conscious employees for its retail stores. Apple might not ""know a lot about fashion"" just yet, but it desperately wants to be stylish, because it knows that the high-end market is its best long-term — and most lucrative — bet. Of course, Apple is closer to credibility in this space than any of its competitors. ""It's the only tech company that ‘gets’ branding,"" says Martin Webb of Communion, a Tokyo fashion PR agency he founded after heading Marc Jacobs’ marketing in Japan. ""Fashion people use Apple products because there are few stylish alternatives."" Users of rival devices may bristle, but there’s undeniable truth to Webb’s words; walk into a Marc Jacobs store and you're unlikely to find many HTC One M8s. As far as phones go, at least, Apple has the casual fashion customer more or less wrapped up. But with the Watch Edition, the company will dive headfirst into the luxury market. Some commentators believe that the luxury pricing model doesn’t make sense for consumer electronics — particularly wearable gadgets, for which the technology is so nascent that anything released today could be obsolete within a few years. Noted Apple blogger John Gruber, for instance, wrote that the Apple Watch Edition will likely be expensive enough to blow the minds of spec-obsessed tech-heads, but nevertheless wondered if Apple might offer a trade-in program or make the watch’s internals upgradable so as to make it seem a more rational purchase or investment. Gruber’s thoughts are insightful, but on this point don’t go far enough — the Apple Watch Edition will never be a rational purchase or investment. It’ll be an emotional purchase made by the kind of person who wants the most luxurious experience possible in the here and now. ""No one needs a Rolls-Royce — we are very open about that,"" the esteemed British carmaker told The Verge this year. ""These are purchases of the heart."" ""These are purchases of the heart."" ""A phone is more, in a way, like a car,"" says Germade, when asked whether Vertu customers are concerned with technical obsolescence. ""You don’t buy a luxury car because you want to buy it for the next 10 years or 20 years or 100 years; you buy a luxury car because even if you use it for two hours every three days, you want to have the best experience that you can have. If you look at the difference between when you buy a car and when you sell a car, you will realize that it’s actually a huge investment for a product that you use a few times a week."" In other words, the kind of person willing to drop thousands of dollars on an 18-karat gold Apple Watch that performs the same as a $350 aluminum version is the kind of person willing to do that every couple of years as necessary. ""Take it to the next level, think about luxury travel,"" adds Germade. ""You fly from London to Hong Kong first-class with your wife; that’s going to cost you more perhaps than one of our phones. And it only lasts 14 hours — why does it make sense? Because the experience of flying first-class is how you feel when you’re flying first-class. It’s not about ‘Oh my God I’m paying this money and it’s going to last me 20 years;’ it’s 14 hours and it still makes sense because of the intensity of the experience."" The technology industry is resistant to the idea of price being connected to anything other than technical performance, after decades of racing to the bottom in an attempt to attain mainstream acceptance. But these principles avoid the truth that well-made electronic products could be perfectly suited to a luxury audience. Mobile devices are the most important and personal item each of us carry every day, and wearable technology has the potential to skyrocket the intimacy we feel toward our gadgets. So why shouldn’t they be more personal, luxurious, and — yes — expensive? ""The amount of usage you have with a mobile phone is nothing compared to any other product,"" points out Germade. ""So do not try to do this comparison with purchasing a [traditional] watch and purchasing a mobile phone. You have to compare it to purchasing luxury experiences like hotels, like restaurants, like traveling, like cars. This is where you realize that it makes all the sense in the world."" If Apple’s promise of ""the most personal device we’ve ever made"" comes to pass, and consumers start to see it as an essential part of their lives, an expensive Apple Watch targeted at the luxury market could make just as much sense as a Vertu phone. But it’s unclear whether the Edition will be enough. It is, after all, almost exactly the same product as the $349 versions of the watch, materials aside. ""I don't know what the price point is for the Edition, but I doubt it's going to qualify as a ‘luxury’ watch,"" says Webb.  ""Remember that high-end customers in the watch world are paying $75,000 to $250,000 or more,"" says Gene Stone, author of The Watch. ""My sense is that the extra money people would pay would go more toward functionality than looks, i.e. ‘My watch can do things your watch can’t.’"" With the same screen and form factor as the cheaper models, the Apple Watch Edition could struggle to gain credibility with luxury consumers. Even if the watch itself is attractive, it’s hard to imagine many walking into a crowded Apple Store and making a multi-thousand-dollar purchase on the sales floor. Customer support is a big part of the Vertu offering, including 24-hour concierge services and personal contact with the manager of each boutique before the phone is even bought. ""Of course the quality of the product matters, but the key point will be sales strategy, which is very different for luxury goods,"" says Webb. ""[Apple] will have to build a team that can execute sales operations suited to HNWIs [high-net-worth individuals] in tandem with a sustained and sophisticated below-the-line marketing campaign."" To put it another way, Apple’s knack for catchy TV ads isn’t going to help much with the type of customer it’s aiming to attract. It may need to rethink its retail experience altogether. As the Apple Watch represents a new product category for the company, the Edition will be a tentative step into a whole new category of consumer. And even for Apple, which has better brand cachet in fashion circles than any technology company, it’s not clear whether wearable devices will take off with anyone outside the early-adopter gadget set. ""If it’s not meaningful for people, it’s just a gadget,"" says Vertu’s Germade. ""I’m personally not interested in gadgets and neither are our customers."" While the Watch’s design is broadly appealing and the straps offer some level of customization, it might not be enough to overcome the fundamental fashion problem posed by everyone wearing the same thing on their wrist. ""The straps are fun but they’re not going to give people that strange and somehow satisfying sense of owning something different from someone else,"" says Stone. As with the iPhone, then, Apple’s first challenge with the Watch is to demonstrate how it will become an essential part of mainstream, modern life. That’s how Vertu can justify its prices to its customers — your phone is the most important object you own, in many ways, so why not make it as personal and special as possible? Apple would arguably be better off addressing the luxury market with the iPhone, a product that defined a category and changed the world. But as for the Watch? The jury is still out on whether regular people will want it, never mind whether others will spend thousands of dollars on it.",0.6408921380973881,0.3591078619026119,0.16550329654508134,1745,4.9329512893982805,777,6.3050193050193046,0,16,"Apple, Apple's Spring Forward Event, Business, Mobile, Tech, Report"

That doesn't mean Google intends to start opening warehouse and stocking products — the sales would continue to be made through third-party sites. But Google's plan apparently has another component to battle Amazon: the company is considering its own Amazon Prime-like plan with selected retailers that would offer free two-day shipping for an annual fee. According to the WSJ, neither of these plans are confirmed to be moving ahead, but there's a lot of logic behind such a move.

Amazon tells USA Today that by adding fulfillment and sorting centers and expanding its relationship with Fedex, UPS, and USPS over the last year, it's been able to guarantee these additional ordering days. Of course, that's still only so long as the packages don't get held up elsewhere along the line. Last year, Amazon wasn't the only culprit in the package delays. Other retailers were seeing delays too, and package carriers appeared to be one possible reason behind that — UPS even said that its air packages exceeded capacity at one point because it underestimated demand. All of that is because online shopping is growing in popularity, with its percentage of total shopping sales going way up around the holidays. That trend isn't likely to reverse, but it at least sounds like Amazon and the big package carriers have been able to predict and prepare for it this time around.",0.3364052721828954,0.6635947278171046,0.17854493801128,258,4.7054263565891477,157,5.3821656050955413,0,0,Business

The point of that piece was that Bitcoin was suffering from massive swings in price, a volatility driven by speculators trying to get rich investing in Bitcoin, and bad press that would cause the price to plummet. In the year that followed Bitcoin has seen some big swings in price, but the general trend has been down from its highs of last winter. As Matt Phillips points at over at Quartz, viewed against other investments, bitcoin has been the ""worst"" performer of 2014, declining a whopping 52 percent against the US dollar. That drop is actually not the worst performance of the year, as noted by the investor Paul Kedrofsky. If you were hoping to pocket a big profit buying bitcoin, however, it was still terrible news. But if you're more interested in the disruptive innovation that the blockchain technology behind bitcoin might enable, the price of each coin is actually immaterial. What matters most is that the currency stabilizes, avoiding massive changes in value that might scare off the merchants and consumers who have yet to adopt it. So the less attractive of an investment, the better. And as 2014 progressed, bitcoin has actually seen far fewer rapid, massive swings in price.   Bitcoin, in the minds of many smart folks, is not a currency, but a protocol, more like TCP/IP, the bedrock of the internet. It enables an entirely new kind of interaction, a mechanism that is both centralized and decentralized at the same time, a platform that is completely anonymous and yet extremely rich in trust. For folks like that, who are building bitcoin startups or investing in them, the issue that was holding back the adoption of Bitcoin was volatility driven by speculators and the financial press. It could continue to be the worst performing investment class, and it's likely bitcoin will still boom as a sector for venture capital investment. What matter to them is that the number of transactions using bitcoin keep rising, and when viewed through that lens, 2014 was very healthy year.",0.4308493273098789,0.5691506726901211,0.1396163765395381,380,4.8052631578947365,225,5.6888888888888891,0,2,"Business, Tech"

Mashable reports that the minimum price for an Uber ride was raised to $100 at one point, after the service's ""surge pricing"" was activated in response to the high demand. Uber automatically activates surge pricing as demand rises, thus offering rides to those truly willing to pay for them and encouraging more drivers to get on the roads to pick people up. But the practice has frequently irritated consumers, particularly when it's been activated amid crises like this one. Following Mashable's publication of the surge pricing rates, Uber dramatically reversed course. It now says that it will refund any passenger who emails them about using the higher rate to leave the CBD, and it's continuing to offer free rides to anyone leaving the area. ""We are all concerned with the events happening in Sydney,"" Uber says in a blog post. Its response will certainly be helpful to anyone trying to leave Sydney's CBD, but it's hard to ignore that Uber seems to only be offering this in response to the negative attention around its initial surge pricing. Uber initially tweeted about the hostage situation at 9:35PM ET, saying that surge pricing had been activated to get more drivers out. At 10:15 PM ET, it changed course and stated that rides out of the area were free. It's no secret that surge pricing isn't well received, but with an automated system in play, it's bound to keep kicking in at inappropriate times.  We are all concerned with events in CBD.

The law's backers describe it as a necessary measure to thwart terrorist attacks, and it has strong support on both sides of the aisle. But the bill has drawn sharp criticism from French internet companies over fears that it could harm business, and from privacy advocates who say it would severely curtail civil liberties. The proposed law, introduced in Parliament on Monday, would allow the government to monitor emails and phone calls of suspected terrorists and their contacts, without seeking authorization from a judge. Telecommunications and internet companies would be forced to automatically filter vast amounts of metadata to flag suspicious patterns, and would have to make that data freely available to intelligence services. Agents would also be able to plant cameras and bugs in the homes of suspected terrorists, as well as keyloggers to track their online behavior. ""This is not a French Patriot Act."" This week's debate comes more than three months after gunmen killed 17 people in a string of attacks that began at the Paris office of the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo. Following the attacks, Prime Minister Manuel Valls called for stronger surveillance of social media websites and digital communications, raising fears that the government would respond with its own version of the Patriot Act — the sweeping anti-terror legislation that the US passed following the September 11th terrorist attacks. Valls sought to quell those concerns when he announced the bill last month, telling reporters that surveillance operations would only be carried out on suspected terrorists, and that controls would be put in place to prevent abuse. ""This is by no means an implementation of exceptional measures, nor the widespread surveillance of citizens,"" he said. ""The bill makes clear that this enhanced monitoring will only concern terrorist communications, it demonstrates that there will be no mass surveillance... this is not a French Patriot Act."" In a speech to Parliament on Monday, he added that the bill ""has nothing to do with the practices revealed by Edward Snowden,"" referring to the widespread surveillance conducted by the US National Security Agency. But critics say the law gives disproportionate power to the office of the prime minister, and that the proposed controls don't go far enough. The bill calls for the creation of a nine-person commission to conduct oversight of surveillance operations, but it is only authorized to advise the prime minister's office, not override it. Civil rights groups also say the bill's language is dangerously broad in defining legitimate targets, potentially implicating civilians as well as suspected terrorists. ""Suddenly, you're in a system where the government has full power, full control over intelligence services,"" says Eva Blum-Dumontet, an advocacy officer at the London-based watchdog Privacy International. ""If we learn anything from history it's that giving full power to governments on surveilling citizens is really not a good idea.""  Prime Minister Manuel Valls has been the most prominent champion of the bill, which he says is definitely not a ""French Patriot Act."" (Photo by Thierry Chesnot/Getty Images) Privacy International, Amnesty International, and other human rights organizations expressed alarm over the bill when it was announced last month, urging Parliament to give it careful scrutiny. It's also been criticized by the National Digital Council, which advises France's government on technological issues, and by several French web hosting companies, which say the threat of constant government intrusion would undermine their business. Of particular concern is the provision requiring telecoms to automatically filter internet traffic. Under the law, internet service providers would have to install monitoring mechanisms — referred to by the French media as ""black boxes"" — that would use algorithms to detect, in real time, suspicious behaviors in internet metadata. The bill's supporters stress that this metadata would remain anonymous and that content of communications would not be automatically swept up, but the behaviors that would constitute a ""terrorist-like"" pattern are still unclear. Critics say the measure effectively amounts to mass surveillance of web traffic on a disproportionately large scale. Under the bill, recordings could be stored for up to one month, and metadata for up to five years. France's current data protection laws date back to 1978, and are among the strongest in Europe. ""It's a comprehensive data protection framework that applies to both the public sector and all industries,"" Fabrice Naftalski, a data privacy attorney and partner at the legal firm EY in Paris, says of current French law. ""Protection of personal data is a fundamental right."" ""They don't seem to actually want to debate."" But the country's counter-terrorism laws haven't been revised since 1991, which was the original impetus behind drafting this bill last summer. The legislation took on a new sense of urgency following January's attacks, when Valls moved to fast-track it for passage by this summer. (A vote is expected early next month.) An alarmingly high number of French nationals have traveled to fight in Syria and Iraq, according to interior ministry figures, and the government has sought to combat jihadist propaganda on social media. Three weeks after the Charlie Hebdo attacks, the government released a highly stylized website to deter young people from joining radical movements. Last month, Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve traveled to the US to urge companies like Facebook and Google to play a more active role in turning over user information to French authorities. Blum-Dumontet welcomes stronger regulation of France's intelligence services, noting that the measures it aims to codify are things that ""are already happening in the dark."" But she fears that Valls' bill may be rushed through while the wounds of Charlie Hebdo are still fresh, and without the kind of careful deliberation it deserves. ""They don't seem to actually want to debate and have a roundtable about what the secret services should be entitled to do,"" Blum-Dumontet says. ""And I think that's a really problematic attitude.""",0.6757700118798585,0.3242299881201415,0.8603990023800074,1014,5.442800788954635,536,6.6791044776119399,1,2,"Policy & Law, US & World, National Security, Report"

""If someone can’t afford to pay for connectivity, it is always better to have some access than none at all,"" Zuckerberg writes in a Facebook post discussing the recent events. Zuckerberg argues that net neutrality is ""not in conflict"" with Internet.org — an app that offers free internet access but only to select websites — because the service does not throttle or block other websites (though you could fairly argue that it blocks every website that it doesn't grant access to).  ""It's too expensive to make the whole internet free."" Unlike in the United States, the primary net neutrality argument in India right now isn't about fast lanes — it's about what's known as ""zero rating."" Zero rating means that accessing some websites and apps doesn't eat into an internet subscriber's data allotment. In the case of Internet.org, access to zero-rated websites is given away for free with the goal of offering some internet connection to those who can't afford any. The side effect of this, however, is that people are much more likely to use free websites than any other websites, giving a distinct advantage to companies that are included in Internet.org. Some opponents have argued that Facebook's intention is to make people confuse the internet with Facebook itself. Zuckerberg says that net neutrality is compatible with Internet.org (by most definitions, it's not), but his primary argument doesn't really have to do with that. Instead, he's basically just saying that it's too important to get people online to worry about these things. That's not an altogether terrible argument: at least in its incarnation at launch, Internet.org provided access to Wikipedia, an HIV prevention and counseling service, a women's rights app, a job-finding service, and Google. It also included access to Facebook and Messenger, but it's hard to argue that it's wholly troubling when more people have access to these other websites. The issue is that more and more services are being added, and their competitors don't necessarily get a chance to be included, too. Zuckerberg says that Facebook doesn't pick what's included in Internet.org on its own — it apparently works with local carriers and governments to decide what makes sense for each country and area that it operates in. But by necessity, some websites are going to be left out. ""It's too expensive to make the whole internet free,"" Zuckerberg writes in reply to a question. ""But by offering some basic services, it's still affordable for [mobile operators], and it's valuable and free for everyone to use.""     Several selected services are now pulling out of Internet.org over concerns of what it'll mean for net neutrality and the internet at large. The Times Group, which operates The Times of India, withdrew involvement of a local paper and a job-finding website (it did not, however, remove free access to The Times of India, noting that it could not do so unless competitors like India Today and the BBC also pulled out). Another publisher, NDTV, also announced that it would be removing support. As did the travel service Cleartrip. Cleartrip wrote on its blog that, although no money was changing hands as part of its involvement in Internet.org, it ultimately doesn't like ""the idea of large corporations getting involved with picking and choosing who gets access to what and how fast."" Facebook says that 800 million people in nine countries are now using Internet.org. ""Arguments about net neutrality shouldn’t be used to prevent the most disadvantaged people in society from gaining access or to deprive people of opportunity,"" Zuckerberg writes. There's little arguing with the idea that spreading internet access is important, but it's worth remembering that alongside every other website on Internet.org is that little blue button to access Facebook.

""This archive shows the inner workings of an influential multinational corporation."" The data in question had already been obtained by a number of journalists, but it was not widely available to the public and technical issues made it unwieldy for casual searches. The data was initially released through torrent files, but the release was intermittent and the torrents have long since dropped off the web. The emails also arrived as server-side Outlook files, requiring significant unpacking before they could be browsed. Wikileaks' new database does away with many of those problems, with easy search of both documents and emails. It also raises many of the same ethical questions that publications grappled with surrounding the leaks. Sony Pictures executive Amy Pascal was fired in the wake of the leaks, due in large part to a published argument with Scott Rudin over Aaron Sorkin's upcoming Steve Jobs film. At the same time, many of the emails brought important news stories to light, including the MPAA's ongoing campaign against Google, a campaign the group referred to as ""Project Goliath."" The emails relating to Goliath have never been published in their entirety, but they are now available to be viewed here. The data also revealed details of Sony Pictures CEO Michael Lynton's activities on the Snapchat board, including the company's brief interest in launching a music label. At the same time, the motives behind the Sony Pictures hack have made many uncomfortable with the publication of the data. North Korea is widely believed to have been responsible for the attack, as retaliation for Sony Pictures' release of The Interview. President Obama called the attack an effort to ""intimidate US businesses and artists exercising their right of freedom of speech"" and placed sanctions on North Korea in the wake of the attack. Sony Pictures has already condemned the new archive in a statement obtained by the LA Times. ""The attackers used the dissemination of stolen information to try to harm SPE and its employees, and now WikiLeaks regrettably is assisting them in that effort,"" a spokesperson told the paper.

You can submit your thoughts on the sharing economy to the FTC until May 26th ""We are seeing a dramatic growth in products and services that are built on peer-to-peer platforms, such as ride-sharing and property rentals, as more entrepreneurs harness the power of technology to reach more consumers,"" FTC Chairwoman Edith Ramirez said in a statement. ""The resulting business models have great potential to benefit our economy and consumers. Through our workshop, we want to better understand the competitive impact of these new business models, as well as their interactions with existing regulatory frameworks."" But before the workshop begins on June 9th, the FTC would like to hear your thoughts on questions it has deemed relevant to the sharing economy. Do you think companies like Uber or Lyft should be responsible for any injuries sustained while riding in one of their cars? How reliable is Airbnb's rating system, and is it susceptible to bias? Should your score on one sharing platform affect another? You can submit all of your thoughts on the sharing economy to the FTC until May 26th right here.",0.6707476875814021,0.32925231241859787,0.7124689526115028,264,5.0265151515151514,165,5.9515151515151512,0,0,"Policy & Law, Tech, US & World"

New, completely original games came out so quickly that it was hard to keep up. Today the App Store is a far different place, dominated by me-too clones and free-to-play licensed games. But every so often, a game comes out that reminds you of those early, promised-filled years. They're rare — Alto's Adventure is arguably 2015's only such release so far — but you can add Prune to that short list. It's a simple interactive toy about trimming trees, but it's also the best mobile game I've played in quite a while. The premise is straightforward: a tree starts growing out of the ground, and in order to help it reach its full height, you'll need to carefully trim branches. When those branches hit sunlight they'll sprout flowers, and you'll need to sprout a certain number to finish the level. Naturally, things slowly get more complex. You'll come across obstacles that the tree will need to grow around, and giant red spheres will threaten to poison your tree, forcing you to start over. Later levels introduce the concept of pollination, so that you'll be using flowers to grow even more trees. The more complicated stages will have you growing massive, wonderfully twisted trees that seem to defy nature.  The ramp up is gradual, and even though Prune can get challenging, it always feels supremely relaxing. Much of this has to do with the chill soundtrack and beautiful, ink wash painting-inspired art, but it's also the gameplay itself. The trees grow at a measured pace, so you never feel rushed, and the controls are dead simple: swipe to start a tree growing, and swipe the branches to slice them off. There's no punishment for failure, you just start over, which encourages experimentation. And if you take too long on a level the game will simply let you skip ahead and come back later. For Joel McDonald, the game's designer, that laid-back gameplay is a direct result of his previous gig, spending the last seven years working on big-budget shooters at larger studios. ""Don't get me wrong, I love shooters, and grew up on Quake,"" he explains. ""But working on first-person shooters for so long is like only eating oatmeal for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Oatmeal can be pretty darn tasty, but sometimes you just want some huevos rancheros, y'know? Prune is my huevos rancheros."" Prune has been in development for around a year and a half, and during that time McDonald toyed with all kinds of ideas to flesh out the experience. There was a two-player option at one point and a mode that let you play endlessly, with no ultimate goal in mind. But the final product is much simpler, with just one mode and a number of different levels to play through. ""It took me awhile to realize that I needed to cut away all that other stuff and just focus on the heart and soul of the game, the expressiveness of cultivating and shaping trees,"" McDonald says. Just like some of the earliest iPhone games, Prune is unlike anything I've played before, an original and strange game that's both soothing and absorbing. It's the kind of experience I want to pull out to show my friends instead of a game to kill a few minutes while I'm in riding the subway. You can check it out now on iOS for $3.99.

Rather than delve deeply into policy, interviewer Ana Marie Cox presses the senator about who he is under that ""wacko bird"" exterior. As a youth, he was an unpopular nerd. He loved and still loves Spider-Man and Han Solo. He's a regular human being! However, there's just one thing about Cruz that will not stand: he is flat out wrong about Captain Jean-Luc Picard. Cruz sides with Captain James T. Kirk, the OG captain of the Enterprise, in this battle (which is perfectly fair!), but he puts his foot in his mouth again and again during the interview. Take this statement: No, sir. First of all, a better argument would be to say that Roddenberry inverted the dynamic Kirk had with Spock in TOS to serve as the blueprint for Picard's relationship with Riker in TNG. Picard is rational, diplomatic, and cool-headed in the same way that Spock always was. Meanwhile, Riker, like Kirk, is more dynamic and quicker to jump into bed with anything that moves. Second, none of this means Picard is somehow an incomplete captain, devoted to the mind while disregarding his heart. He was passionate, sometimes to a fault.  And he was absolutely a fighter for justice.  Ultimately, Picard is a different captain for a different time. Kirk is a cowboy where Picard is a diplomat. But Picard got his hands dirty for the sake of his crew. And you cannot tell me or any fan that a leader who came back from being assimilated by the Borg or got stabbed through the heart and laughed about it is unfit for command.  Of course, Cruz's statements can't really be taken seriously. He's clearly going too far in his allegiance to Captain Kirk: If anyone thinks a character created during the Civil Rights era by a humanist writer whose politics called for racial and gender equality is somehow a present-day Republican, it's obvious we were never watching the same show.

In the wake of an ongoing controversy surrounding the abuse of Adderall by e-sports players, the Electronic Sports League has said that it will introduce policies to keep drugs out of virtual sports. ""We were all on Adderall."" There are no details yet on how that might work, but the group tells Motherboard that it has ""taken steps to move forward with drugs policing, education, and prevention among participants of [its] competitions."" The ESL describes itself as the ""world's largest e-sports organization,"" though it's far from the only name in the business, and it doesn't cover some of the largest events, including the championships for Dota 2 and League of Legends. The news comes not long after Kory Friesen, a high-ranked Counter-Strike: GO player, not only admitted to using Aderrall, but also said that use of the drug was widespread. ""We were all on Adderall,"" Friesen said in an interview, referring to his team in the organization Cloud9. Adderall is used to treat ADHD and narcolepsy, but also has the side effect of making people more alert and improving reaction times, making it ideal for e-sports like Counter-Strike, where split-second reactions can mean the difference between winning and losing. While use of performance-enhancing drugs in e-sports has long been speculated — a lengthy Eurogamer report in August suggested that it was widespread — few players openly admitted to it before Friesen. While it's not clear what kind of punishments the ESL might enforce for those caught using such drugs, the group says that the enforcement won't be retroactive — so Friesen and his teammates won't be punished for the admission. ""We can't punish someone if we are not 100 percent sure he is guilty,"" the group says. The world's most famous e-sports tournament, The International, will be kicking off on August 3rd with a record-breaking $17.2 million prize pool. Update, 12:50PM: The ESL has since issued a press release, saying that it is still in the ""beginning stages"" of forming a plan for dealing with doping in e-sports, which will include issuing the first performance enhancing drug skin tests at an event in Germany next month. The organization has also partnered with some big names to help formulate its official policy, which is still in the works: In order to maintain the spirit of fair play within e-sports, ESL has partnered with NADA (the Nationale Anti Doping Agentur, which is headquartered in Bonn, Germany) to help create an anti-PED policy that is fair, feasible, and conclusive while also respecting the privacy of players. ESL will also be meeting with WADA (the World Anti Doping Agency, based in Montreal, Canada) so they can be actively involved in the making, enforcing, and dissemination of this policy to additional regions such as the US, Asia, and Australia. There's no timeline for when the official policy will be instated, but the ESL says that ""we will remain proactive in ensuring all professional players and organizations involved in ESL competitions will be kept informed of the initiative’s progress.""

Facebook's photo sharing app Moments, which launched in June, today added a video feature. With this update, Moments will automatically create a photo montage, complete with music, using any grouping of six or more pictures. Moments aims to rescue all those photos languishing on your phone, using face recognition to suggest tags, and letting you sync the selected photos with your Facebook friends. The app's new video feature is similar to other apps like Flipagram, which also lets you create photo stories set to music. But when you want to share your Flipagram creations with your friends, you still have to go through Instagram or Facebook. This is really the greatest advantage Moments seems to have, because it eliminates the extra step of syncing with Facebook when you want to share your collage. Moments' greatest advantage is that it is already synced with Facebook Once you give the app access to the photos on your phone, it takes a couple of seconds to identify your friends and suggest tags. You can create a group of photos that you want to share, and pick who you want to share them with. Moments then creates a collage with the selected photos, set to background music like Adventurous (reminiscent of what you’d hear while trekking across the Old West), Epic (an EDM-like jam), or any one of the 10 music themes.     You can edit the video by swapping out the photos you want to include, or change the background music, but that’s about it. So far, you don’t seem to be able to make any other changes, such as adding filters, or edit the photos from within the app. Another thing missing from the app is the lack of sharing options — you still can’t share your Moments with people who aren’t on Facebook, or through any other medium like email or Twitter. Once you’re done tweaking, one more tap will tag the friends with whom you’ve decided to share the photos, and then share the video to Facebook. In addition to the new video feature, Moments got some other minor updates. You can create now create your own Moments from scratch, see the progress of your photo uploads, and, according to Facebook, use the app in 34 different languages.

For the first time ever, a DNA analysis of Mycobacterium lepromatosis — a recently discovered bacteria that can cause a severe form of leprosy — reveals that the organism separated from its more common counterpart, Mycobacterium leprae, about 14 million years ago. The finding, published today in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, could lead to better diagnostic tests and a more accurate map of leprosy’s geographic distribution. But it’s also intriguing in its own right: it shows that despite having broken off into separate species long ago, two pathogens can continue to infect a host — humans — in very similar ways. about 200,000 new infections each year Leprosy is a rare and painful chronic infection that can lead to skin lesions, vision problems, and the loss of extremities. Doctors see about 200,000 new infections each year, in countries such as India, Mexico, Brazil, Indonesia, and the Philippines. The small number of cases may have contributed to our limited knowledge of the disease; until recently, researchers thought that a single organism — Mycobacterium leprae — was responsible for all those cases. But that changed eight years ago. ""There were some strong reactions from the leprosy community and disbelief,"" says Xiang-Yang Han, a microbiologist at The University of Texas who discovered that leprosy is caused by two bacterial species. ""I discovered [Mycobacterium lepromatosis] in 2007, and published the results 2008."" An analysis demonstrated that the organisms were very similar; the two species ""are cousins,"" Han says. Unfortunately, without a full DNA sequence, it was hard to know exactly what linked the two species together — or how long ago they went their separate ways. ""very similar sets of genes despite having diverged around 14 million years ago."" By analyzing human tissue infected with the bacteria, researchers were able to extract bacterial DNA and compare the genomes of both species. The comparison helped them pinpoint the timing of their separation, which the researchers say happened about 14 million years ago. ""The most surprising for us was the fact that the genomes of the two species had very similar sets of genes despite having diverged around 14 million years ago,"" says Andrej Benjak, a geneticist at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne, and one of the co-authors of the study. About 10 percent of their DNA sequence is different, which means that ""most of the genes present in one species are also present in the other."" Some changes did occur, however. Over 300,000 mutations differentiate the two species, Benjak says. These changes don't appear to have significantly altered the way the bacteria act on humans, however. This means that the two species probably evolved as ""leprosy-causing agents"" a long time ago, Benjak says. And after that, they didn’t deviate from their evolutionary path. After that, they didn’t deviate from their evolutionary path The study ""is pretty much as good as it gets,"" says Han, who didn't take part in this study. Because the species can’t be cultivated in a lab — the pathogens can only grow on living host organisms — ""we could only do a descriptive analysis of the genome sequence and deduce that M. leproamatosis has a similar biology as M. leprae,"" Benjak says. This is pretty standard; delving deeper into the physiological aspects of bacteria that can't survive on its own is very challenging, if not impossible, he says. Still, having a genetic blueprint like this one is just the first step, Han says. ""With this whole genome in hand we can develop more diagnostic tools."" And having better diagnostics will could lead to a more accurate map of M. lepromatosis' geographic distribution. Right now, ""it seems to be restricted to Mexico and probably the surrounding area, but it does not seem to be globally ubiquitous as M. leprae,"" Benjak says. But Han says that some cases have been observed Singapore as well. In an interesting twist, Han admits that his own team of researchers has also just sequenced the genome of M. lepromatosis, the species he discovered. They hope to publish an announcement to that effect in the coming weeks. ""It just took us a little longer,"" he says. ""We will learn from them.""",0.6221076325600594,0.3778923674399406,0.8222673675975204,723,5.1161825726141075,371,6.1509433962264151,0,0,"Science, Report"

""insight into the sequence of the genome of an entire nation."" ""What we have is a fairly detailed insight into the sequence of the genome of an entire nation,"" says Kari Stefansson, a neurologist and co-author of four studies published in Nature Genetics today. He's also the CEO of biopharmaceutical company deCode, which partly funded the work. ""This is a reasonably large step toward understanding how human diversity is dictated by diversity in the sequence of DNA."" The estimate for the most recent common male ancestor contradicts some past findings. A 2013 study from the University of Arizona estimated that the age of the father of all humans is about 340,000 years old. But the Icelandic analysis indicates he probably lived about 239,000 years ago — a number that’s much closer to the estimate for humanity’s most recent common female ancestor, who lived about 200,000 years ago. ""[Humans] are curious about where we came from, and how we became the way we are,"" says Agnar Helgason, a genetic anthropologist at the University of Iceland and a co-author of the common ancestor study published today. ""And this gives us a bit more information about when."" From an evolutionary standpoint, older species have more time to develop mutations that differentiate individuals, or populations, from one another. That means the age of the human species is also related to how diverse humans are as a whole.  8,000 Icelanders who have a least one gene that’s completely mute Scientists also used the Icelandic data to identify 8,000 Icelanders who have a least one gene that’s completely mute, meaning that it doesn’t function at all. Genes associated with people's sense of smell were muted most often, but the researchers found 1,171 silenced genes overall. ""We now have an insight into [human silenced genes] — how frequently do you encounter individuals who have all variants of a gene knocked out."" That number is about 7.7 percent of Icelanders, Stefansson says. The size of these studies is impressive. But that doesn’t mean that they were perfectly designed. The people whose genomes were used in the muted gene paper, for instance, were taken from past disease studies, says Andrew Allen, a geneticist at Duke University who didn’t take part in the studies. This means that the ""sample studied is not exactly healthy, is somewhat opportunistic, and probably doesn’t correspond to any ‘real’ population."" Sample studied ""probably doesn’t correspond to any ‘real’ population."" Moreover, the ""Icelandic population has a rather unusual demographic history,"" Allen says. The country is relatively isolated, with just 320,000 inhabitants. Their ancestors had little contact with outsiders until recently. This makes it hard to evaluate whether the findings are related to some kind of selection process for genes that enhanced human survival over time, or something else, like the size of the Icelandic population. Stefansson says that the results should still be representative of people in other areas, however. ""The Icelandic population doesn’t meet any of the criteria for inbreeding,"" he says. ""The 7.7 percent is likely to be similar in other populations."" Still, the study could yield helpful information about the location of genes that might be less susceptible to this loss of function, Allen says. And even larger studies of this type will go a long way toward figuring out the genetic patterns at finer scales and validating the findings. Now that the studies have been published, the scientists must decide whether they will provide the study participants with information about their genomes and their genetic risk for various diseases. ""When we started our work, the whole world was convinced that these results should not be returned to the participants.""  Stefansson says. But ""in Iceland, just like everywhere else, people have been developing ideas about what is right and what is wrong."" Those views have been changing, even though the goal of making discoveries for science haven't. ""I’m convinced that the Icelandic society will begin to use our data, together with the health care system,"" he says. ""I think it is the view of most people that it is the only ethical thing to do.""

While the findings aren't perfectly representative of the nation as a whole, they indicate that a wealth of minerals are being pooped out on a daily basis. The surprising wealth of minerals is most likely the result of compounds in common consumer products, said the researchers, who presented their findings today at the  National Meeting & Exposition of the American Chemical Society.

Only half of all treated sewage is viable as fertilizer, and Smith hopes that metal removal could increase that percentage.

Nitrogen is required for all life on Earth, but it has to be in a certain ""fixed"" state before it's accessible to many forms of life, like plants. That's the way researchers found it in samples collected on Mars. The finding suggests that Mars could have supported a nitrogen cycle, which on Earth involves bacteria creating fixed nitrogen, which then works its way into plants, and eventually back into the soil, where the cycle repeats. In Mars' case, the found nitrogen likely arose from lightning strikes or heat from an impact. But the researchers say that it's enough to warrant continued research into evidence for an ancient nitrogen cycle on Mars.  ""Life runs on nitrogen as much as it runs on carbon."" ""People want to follow the carbon, but in many ways nitrogen is just as important a nutrient for life,"" Jennifer Stern, who led the research at NASA, tells the Los Angeles Times. ""Life runs on nitrogen as much as it runs on carbon."" The report points out that critical elements of life, including RNA and DNA, require nitrogen. The research was published Monday in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The presence of nitrogen, detected as nitric oxide coming from nitrates in the soil, was still fairly small. The researchers say that it was found in amounts an order of magnitude smaller than they would be found in Chile's Atacama Desert or the Dry Valleys of Antarctica. Those low levels, it suggests, are likely because we are now observing the remnants of ancient nitrogen fixation amid changed atmospheric conditions. In a separate paper, also published Monday in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, research from Louisiana State University points to potential source of energy for life on Mars: carbon monoxide. The paper suggests that carbon monoxide, which is found in ""relatively high concentrations"" in Mars' atmosphere, could be used as a ""significant energy source"" for microbes on or near the surface. ""Of course, it must be noted that the persistence of extant microbial populations, if any exist, or populations transplanted in the future, depends on factors other than energy substrates,"" the paper notes. Nonetheless, it suggests that additional work could be put into determining just how conducive Mars may have been to microbial growth in this manner at an earlier point in its history.

They can change their skin's patterns and colors to blend into their surroundings, hunt prey, and potentially communicate with other squid. For the past several years, researchers at UC Irvine have been trying to use these unique squid abilities to disguise soldiers on the battlefield. At a meeting of the American Chemical Society this week, Alon Gorodetsky of the school's Department of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science presented his team's latest research on harnessing the power of cephalopods for futuristic camouflage. The core of the project is reflectin, a protein that squid and other cephalopods can use to manipulate light and color. In the lab, Gorodetsky's team can manufacture large quantities of reflectin in E. coli bacteria. ""You could collect thousands and thousands of squid and extract the protein from them, but that might be animal cruelty on some level,"" he joked during a press conference. That reflectin gets painted onto an ordinary roll of tape, creating specific colors by varying how thickly it's applied. ""You could potentially shimmer."" By itself, that's not much better than existing camouflage. But once it's been painted on, changing the thickness will also change the color. Squid can do this by flexing to expand and contract small, reflectin-filled cells in their skin. Gorodetsky's team used a simpler version of this method: they stretched the tape to switch colors, then applied heat to pull it back into shape. With a lot more research, this could turn simple tape into versatile, flexible camouflage stickers. Soldiers would cover themselves in strips of reflectin, fine-tune it to a specific color or pattern, and be able to change it on the fly. By itself, this isn't a new idea either. Cephalopods' shifting skin has unsurprisingly proved fascinating to researchers. MIT scientists, for example, created squid-inspired color- and texture-changing panels last year. But Gorodetsky says his team is specifically interested in the colors humans can't see. ""Most people focus on the visible, we care about the infrared,"" he says. If they can create stickers that successfully reflect or obscure infrared light, the possibilities for camouflage are clear. A makeshift tape-suit might look almost transparent under normal light, but would shine under infrared — then, with a little stretch, the stickers would go dark. Just like traditional camouflage, this could break up the wearer's outline, letting them blend in with their surroundings. ""If you have these stickers all over you and you're moving around, you could potentially shimmer,"" Gorodetsky says. ""If you're in the forest, and everything's reflecting in the infrared, you'll be much, much harder to detect."" This reflectin-coated tape shines under infrared light. Stretched out, it goes dark. (Credit: Alon Gorodetsky) Fabric that can change how it reflects heat or light might also have applications outside the military. The Department of Energy's research wing recently awarded UC Irvine a grant to create ""tunable thermoregulatory fabric,"" which could help the residents of a large building ""harness their own individual radiant heat"" and let the managers keep a consistent, more energy-efficient single temperature. In practice, it ends up sounding like hyper-advanced sweater technology, where people could adjust their temperature with clothing that changes how much it reflects or absorbs heat. Right now, there's still a great deal of work to do. For one thing, stretching a whole uniform's worth of stickers into a consistent pattern isn't easy. ""You'd really need each one of them to be integrated with some sort of stretching device or electrical trigger,"" he says. ""Conceptually, given how modern electronics and networked control systems work, it's definitely feasible. The devil's in the details."" Turning a single set of clothing into its own little network would drive up costs and defeat the whole purpose of the stickers — that they can be quickly configured, used, and thrown away when needed. And there's another, more fundamental problem. In order to really thwart infrared cameras, the camouflage will have to hide body heat, something that Gorodetsky's latest strips can't do — they can only hit near-infrared wavelengths. He cautions against saying that his strips can defeat infrared cameras, at least right now. ""These probably aren't bright enough to be game-changing applications yet,"" he said at the conference. ""But it's a very, very nice demonstration of what you can do by drawing inspiration from these amazing animals.""",0.6094876506212292,0.3905123493787708,0.17047448329723405,726,5.4118457300275482,426,6.4460093896713619,0,2,"Science, Report"

A newly identified gene could change that, according to a study published in Nature today. The gene has been found to play a role in severe autism in women — as well as some men. The finding could motivate more researchers to study the disorder in families in which multiple women are affected by autism. studying autism in women is beneficial for autism research as a whole Women experience something called the ""female protective effect,"" which means they need either more severe mutations or many more than men to develop the disorder, says Tychele Turner, an autism researcher at The University of Washington and a co-author of the study. That also means that studying autism in women could be very beneficial for autism research as a whole: women might be more useful to reveal which mutations cause severe autism, Turner says. This is exactly what her research group achieved, after all. In the study, Turner and her team analyzed the genes of 13 unrelated women with severe autism, who also have relatives affected by the disorder. They found that a gene called CTNND2 has more mutations than one would expect to see in someone without autism, which led them to conclude that the gene probably played a role. ""We assessed thousands of additional patients to determine if the genetic signal we found was real."" A genetics study with only 13 participants isn’t all that convincing, though. So, the researchers sifted through genetic data from thousands of other people, gathered from past studies. ""We assessed thousands of additional patients to determine if the genetic signal we found was real,"" Turner says. The additional patients showed that, in general, people with autism tend to have mutations in this gene more often than people without.  ""There are a number of cases — more than we would have expected — that have a severe mutation in this gene."" Still, finding that these mutations occur more often in people with severe autism doesn’t mean the mutations cause the disorder or its symptoms. So, the researchers tinkered with the genes of zebrafish, to make the animals express the mutations. The researchers found that the mutations caused problems in a biological pathway —  a set of molecular changes that are linked in the body — that has previously been associated with autism. Researchers then moved to mice, where they muted the CTNND2 gene. As a result, neurons in the hippocampus, a sea horse-shaped area which is important for long-term memory, didn't ""talk"" to each other as much. ""The findings are very exciting,"" says Kevin Pelphrey, an autism researcher at Yale University who didn’t participate in the study. The fact that they looked at zebrafish and mice to see the effects of the gene, and modeled its role in neuron development is very novel, he says. ""They go well beyond finding this gene."" The overall approach employed by Turner’s team is ""groundbreaking in terms of the methods and the extent to which these researchers demonstrate how the gene can lead to autism."" ""underrepresented patients are very important, and we should study them."" Now that the study has been published, Turner has moved on to researching autism in a more commonly researched population: men. But she thinks her work might jump-start more research on women with autism. Families with multiple affected women are ""extremely rare and they have been underrepresented in previous large-scale genetic screens,"" Turner says. But ""underrepresented patients are very important, and we should study them — just because they are more rare doesn’t mean that they should be excluded from our study."" ""The finding will lead other researchers to adopt this ground-breaking approach,"" Pelphrey says. The implications for treatment aren’t immediate, however. Instead, the findings will serve as a basis for the study of mechanisms that lead to autism, especially autism in women. And further research on this gene and its function could eventually mean gene therapies or drug therapies down the line. ""It will take time to develop these therapies,"" Pelphrey says. ""But the findings in this paper pave a pathway forward.""",0.5712359648098977,0.4287640351901023,0.8289091199432699,720,5.1055555555555552,326,6.2208588957055211,0,0,"Science, Report"

I move on to Four Roses on the rocks, while Casey Newton gets started on Old Fashioneds. My notes indicate a long and serious discussion about the attractiveness of Jarvis Cocker at 10:30PM, followed by Casey stealing a colleague's drink at 10:43PM. ""I’m not leaving this bar until your handwriting looks like you’ve had a stroke,"" Casey informs me around 11:00PM. ""You’re just going to have to keep ordering those roses."" I order my fourth drink immediately. By 11:20PM, Casey and another colleague are deep in discussion regarding their romantic lives. Then the notes get sparse. At 12:47AM, I have the hiccups, but by 12:51AM, I’m cured. Shortly after that, Casey and I get in a cab headed back to our hotel. I suspect there was a minimum of 40 roses between Casey and me by the time the evening was out, plus another shot of Jameson to send us into the cab, and then beers with the video crew when we got back to the hotel. I meant to keep track of how much I was drinking, but then I got drunk. Ordinarily, I like a glass of wine with dinner, but that’s about it. That night, though, I was actually looking to get hungover. I’d heard about an IV hangover treatment and I wanted to see if it actually worked.       Even though about three-quarters of people who drink experience at least one hangover a year, we don’t really know how they work. Which is strange, because hangovers contribute to workplace absenteeism, worsen job performance (which matters a lot if you’re, say, operating heavy machinery while hungover), impair memory and learning, and lead to what researchers refer to as ""a feeling of general misery."" About 10 percent of adults in the US — 11.6 million workers — are hungover on the job, a 2006 study found. Here’s what we do know: If your BAC gets above .10, you’re probably going to be hungover. You’ll feel your worst when you get close to zero, about 12 to 16 hours later. The hangover happens when a person’s blood alcohol concentration falls sharply; the nadir of symptoms occurs when the BAC is close to zero. The symptoms that clinically signify a hangover will be familiar: thirst, dizziness, nausea, headache, concentration problems, and headache — and I would experience them all the following morning. But no model exists for why these things happen in the first place. Hangovers also affect the mood — they make people anxious and depressed. This is what Kingsley Amis called ""the metaphysical hangover"" in Everyday Drinking: ""When that ineffable compound of depression, sadness (these two are not the same), anxiety, self-hatred, sense of failure and fear for the future begins to steal over you, start telling yourself that what you have is a hangover,"" Amis writes. ""You are not sickening for anything, you have not suffered a minor brain lesion, you are not all that bad at your job, your family and friends are not leagued in a conspiracy of barely maintained silence about what a shit you are, you have not come at last to see life as it really is."" It is worth noting that Amis’ family and friends were leagued in a barely maintained silence about what a shit he was; Amis was an alcoholic. A lot of people think dehydration causes hangovers. Dehydration probably does have some effect — alcohol does affect the levels of a hormone called vasopressin that regulates how the body retains water (this is why people urinate more often while drinking). But the levels of minerals called electrolytes that help water function in the body don’t differ between the hungover and the un-hungover, which suggests dehydration isn’t the primary cause. Other theories for the origin of a hangover include low blood sugar and acetaldehyde, but there’s not great evidence for them, either. There are a few other things that may affect how serious a hangover is, without necessarily causing the condition. Sleeping badly probably doesn’t cause hangovers, but it certainly doesn’t help: alcohol messes up most people’s sleep patterns. There are also compounds called congeners, found in grains, wine skins, or casks used in making the beverages, that appear to make hangovers worse (I drank bourbon with Casey because it’s tasty, but also because it was likely to give me a bad hangover; whiskey has a lot of congeners). And while most booze we drink is composed of ethanol, traces of other kinds of alcohols slip into some drinks. One of those compounds, called methanol, metabolizes into formaldehyde and formic acid, neither of which are going to make someone feel good. The main suspect in causing a hangover is the immune system And the main suspect in causing a hangover is the immune system. Proteins called cytokines — part of how the immune system talks to itself — had already been identified as a likely cause by a 2000 overview paper on hangovers in The Annals of Internal Medicine. Cytokines also, as a special bonus, can make a person feel really bad. You know how miserable it is to have a cold? That’s not the virus’s fault — that’s your immune system. In a recent study of 20 men who got drunk and then had their blood tested while they were hungover, Korean scientists found higher levels of cytokines associated with autoimmune disease. These included tumor necrosis factor alpha, which is also responsible for rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease. Fortunately, if immune inflammation is the root cause of the hangover, the cure may be pretty simple: anti-inflammatories. Some anti-inflammatories are available over the counter, like aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil), or naproxen (Aleve). Upon discovering researchers had made this connection, writer Adam Rogers — whose excellent Proof is a must-read for alcohol-loving nerds — began dosing himself with ibuprofen after drinking, before going to bed. This is similar to what Casey did; he took Aleve before bedtime. So, we don’t know a lot about how hangovers work, which makes it very hard to design a good cure. There is no data on the usefulness of an IV in fixing a hangover. That’s not to say it won’t work; it might. But I have no way of knowing in advance whether I’ll be wasting my time and The Verge’s money at Hangover Heaven.     I wake up around 7AM after Casey’s and my rampage. It’s a bad scene. The hotel room is too bright and smells like stale beer. My head hurts. My tongue is the texture, approximately, of felt. My eyeballs feel as though they’d been pulled from my skull, rolled around in some grit, and ineptly replaced — even my eyelids hurt. I fumble for my sunglasses and discover that very small porcupines had apparently crept down my gullet in my sleep; they are now using my stomach as a bounce castle. I feel bad. I meet Casey for breakfast, in the sense that I watch him eat his. For me, hot coffee is untenable. Even the very bland oatmeal I’ve chosen is too much for me. Casey is in better shape, the shit. So then it’s time. I take a cab to Hangover Heaven. The driver accelerates and brakes so sharply I am in danger of puking. I also manage to leave my phone in the back seat while I pay for the cab — something I don’t realize until about half an hour later. Nausea, check. Concentration problems, check. i feel bad Hangover Heaven is located in an unpromising-looking strip mall; a van and what appears to be a decommissioned ambulance with the Hangover Heaven logo are parked outside. The clinic is run by Jason Burke, 44, an anesthesiologist who noticed that people who are recovering from anesthesia seem an awful lot like hungover people. ""Basically, this started when I was working in a recovery room,"" Burke says. ""I was seeing people in the recovery room with postoperative nausea and vomiting, headache, dizziness — that type of thing. They’re exactly the same ones people have with a hangover. So I thought, these same medications would work well for hangovers.""   When we arrive for my 10AM appointment, the place is mostly empty, and Burke greets us warmly; he speaks with a slight drawl. He has expensive-looking teeth, which I see often, since he smiles readily and widely. His shoulder-length brown hair is pulled into a ponytail. Burke, who favors Bordeaux and California cabernets, has the air of a surfer bro who just happens to have gone to medical school. I am steered into a dim room, where I sit down in a large leather recliner. I am asked to rate my symptoms — nausea, headache, anxiety, and overall hangover severity — on a scale from 1 to 10; the medics determine my hangover is severe enough to warrant the ""Rapture Package,"" the most expensive one on the menu. I am hooked up to an oxygen tank, and an IV is inserted into my right arm, where I receive an anti-emetic (to keep me from vomiting), an anti-inflammatory (ibuprofen in IV form), and heartburn medication. I’m also getting alpha-lipoic acid, an antioxidant that interacts with my blood sugar. The fluid from the IV makes my upper right arm cold. the medics determine my hangover is severe enough to warrant the ""rapture package"" After a trial run with volunteers, Burke purchased a bus as a kind of soft opening for his business. Real estate in Las Vegas often requires a five-year lease, he says — he didn’t know if the business was going to work, and he didn’t want to get stuck paying the lease if Hangover Heaven went bust. With a bus, if things didn’t work out, he could just sell it.  More than half of Burke's clients never enter the clinic at all Things worked out; Burke leased the site where I was treated. Hangover Heaven treats 10,000 people a year. But more than half of Burke’s clients never enter the clinic at all — for a $200 fee, a physician or nurse practitioner will come to your hotel room. His clientele generally stay at high-end casinos and are spending about $800 a day on their vacation (""To miss a day of their vacation is a big issue,"" Burke says). Hangover Heaven does its best business during convention season, March Madness, and Super Bowl Sunday. The treatments range in cost from $99 for an IV plus vitamins, to the Rapture package at $239. This seems expensive. On the other hand, I had actual drugs given to me by actual medical professionals. That’s pretty much always expensive. Burke views his work as a harm-reduction strategy; people are going to drink no matter what. He hopes to make them less miserable — and turn a profit doing it. ""It’s just the nature of Las Vegas,"" he says. ""People come here to drink. They want to blow off some steam. Alcohol is part of that."" The conference circuit can be particularly brutal; some of Burke’s clientele are performers and executives who are puking their guts out just hours before they’re due onstage for their keynote.     Partway through the interview with Burke, a female nurse comes over and interrupts — time for my vitamin B-12 shot. We retire to the restroom, for privacy-type reasons. As I slide my leggings down, I realize that getting a vitamin B shot in the ass is the closest I will ever come to being a Kennedy. The shot is basically painless. I return to the recliner, wheeling my IV with me. Burke chalks up some of the misery of hangovers to vitamin deficiency. From what I can tell in the research literature, a vitamin B-6 analog called pyritinol does have positive effects on hangovers. There doesn’t seem to be much else on the role of vitamins. Burke’s business hinges, in part, on selling vitamins — his supplements, $5 a packet of four, claim to prevent hangovers for ""one night of moderate drinking."" He clearly believes in what he’s selling, but the research I’ve seen doesn’t back it up. I email him after our meeting to ask if I’ve missed anything; he admits the science is scant. ""So little good science has been done on hangovers that extrapolation is necessary,"" he writes. By the end of the interview — about 45 minutes after I sit down — I’ve improved, though I’m still a little queasy. I had been wondering, given the relative emptiness of Hangover Heaven, how this was a viable business. But just as I’ve recovered, things start to get busy — of course, 10AM is a little early for the painfully hungover to heave themselves upright. Burke walks me to the counter as a group of 20-somethings come in. He greets them warmly; Hangover Heaven has frequent fliers, and this crew had been in the day before. Back at the hotel, the cabbie from the morning arrives to drop off my phone. I meet Casey. I feel great, and I am ready to gloat about it. How’s he doing? ""Oh, I feel fine,"" Casey says. ""I took more Aleve."" I wish hangovers were taken more seriously by the research community. They’re so common that knowing more about them would probably benefit most of the population. The relatively scant research into hangovers means that I can’t say, conclusively, whether Casey’s method of handling his hangover was better than mine. It means I also can’t tell whether Jason Burke is right about the role of vitamins and antioxidants in hangover recovery; though anti-hangover vitamin pills make me deeply suspicious. Vitamin studies are notorious among the research community for being inconclusive. Anyway, if you’ve got the money, getting an IV and medical care probably can’t hurt. But for the rest of us plebs, there’s always painkillers and water.

The statistics for registered nurses are particularly startling because, as the study points out, the field is dominated by women: in 2013, the US Census Bureau counted 3.5 million nurses, of which 3.2 million were women and 330,000 were men (only 78 percent of nurses were registered nurses). Despite that, the minority of men in the field — about one for every ten women — are still paid more. The pay gap has been closing in the US, albeit very slowly. According to The New York Times, the national pay gap is at a record low, but the US still hasn't closed even half of the gap present in 1960, when women earned 60 cents for every dollar a man earned.",0.45011466636274816,0.5498853336372518,0.8940502838772818,338,4.6065088757396451,193,5.5181347150259068,1,2,"Science, US & World"

NASA confirmed this week that the six-wheeled robot has now traveled more than 26.219 miles in 11 years and two months. ""This is the first time any human enterprise has exceeded the distance of a marathon on the surface of another world,"" said Opportunity's project manager John Callas. ""A first time happens only once."" Opportunity has already wildly exceeded expectations. The rover was originally scheduled to operate for only 90 Martian days (a Martian day or sol is around 40 minutes longer than an Earth day). And apart from exceeding its run-time by more than 10 years, it's also made numerous scientific discoveries, including examining the first meteorite found on another planet and finding evidence that water once flowed across Mars.

Its twin rover, Spirit, stopped moving in 2010 and became (rather euphemistically) a ""static research station."" And Opportunity is suffering from the gradual decay that affects all computer systems. Its flash memory has worn out out after numerous writes and re-writes, and as a consequence the rover is suffering from bouts of amnesia.  ""[Opportunity] has been amazingly healthy considering how much we’ve used it — we thought the mobility system would have worn out a long ago but it’s in great health,"" said Callas in December last year.

It's a sport that embraced advanced statistics alongside more ""old school"" scouting and basic counting stats like RBIs, but it's also one where the ""human element"" plays a huge role in almost every part of the game — specifically, the home plate umpire who calls either a ball or strike on every single pitch. With the advent of advanced technology like the Pitch F/X system that tracks the location of every pitch thrown in a game, fans have started wondering when the umpire might get put out to pasture — or at least get some assistance from this system that has been installed in all 30 major league stadiums. MLB might be an organization extremely resistant to change, but fortunately independent leagues like the Pacific Association are free to experiment. That's how a minor-league game between the San Rafael Pacifics and the visiting Vallejo Admirals had its balls and strikes called by the Pitch F/X system last night. Wired was on hand to check it out, and it sounds like it was a lot less drama than you'd expect — the home plate umpire was freed up to keep a closer eye on other parts of the game. The computer results of the ball and strike data were simply checked out by another umpire at a computer terminal; that ump then made the call over the loudspeaker. It's the first professional baseball game in which a computer had the final say on balls and strikes. The first game with a computer calling the plate, but probably not the last It seems like there were no issues to speak of throughout the game, but purist still may balk at such a system being rolled out in the big leagues for a variety of reasons. Not the least among those is that Pitch F/X doesn't actually track the ball all the way into the catcher's mitt — instead, the cameras stop tracking a few feet from home plate and algorithms predict the ball's final location. Those predictions are supposed to be accurate to within an inch, but for a pitcher trying to put the baseball exactly where he wants it to go, that margin of error could make a difference. Of course, we know umpires blow ball and strike calls multiple times throughout a game, so this is really just a different kind of inaccuracy.",0.37610324806354833,0.6238967519364517,0.19247253403662754,403,4.5905707196029777,242,5.446280991735537,0,0,"Culture, Tech"

His latest ideas have him experimenting with bioengineering to create hybrid leathers ""grown"" and ""printed"" in a laboratory. The hybrid leathers satisfy the science nerd in Levine, letting him make bags and vests with muscle-like striations as patterns. Levine says he sees it as part of his job to work with companies and figure out how to take their technologies and make them modern and sexy. It's part of a revolution in fashion that, while still in its infancy, is stepping away from classic styles and making a name for itself by being different, digital, and right now, a little weird. ""Fashion is still stuck in its archaic cycle — even with the way things are made,"" Levine says. ""Now it's important to be curious, and I translate my curiosity with the clothing into something that's utilitarian and sexy.""  Most of the designers featured in Tech In Motion's Wearable Tech Fashion Show are, like Levine, fighting against fashion's antiquated methods and aesthetics with new weapons. Mary Huang, founder of Continuum Fashion, focuses on 3D printing shoes that are both stunning and actually wearable. Many of her designs could only be produced with a 3D printer due to the fluidity of the designs, and while her work allows her to play with new forms, she says it's also an experiment to see how the medium can revolutionize the manufacturing of shoes. According to Huang, if fashion companies used 3D printing for more than just prototyping in the future, it could save the industry money by removing arduous and expensive production processes, like molding, for shoes. This could render everything based on digital documents, which could even be sold to people to print their own footwear. ""Sometimes I'll put the printer on overnight, and in the morning, there's a shoe,"" she says. ""I'm always trying to see how close I can get to just pulling a shoe off the printer.""  3D printing might be an obvious method for fashion designers to embrace, but technologies from all different fields are inspiring designers to rethink the way they see and do things. Take Sensoree's Mood Sweater — it uses sensors to detect a certain kind of sweat in the palms of your hands that varies depending on your emotional state, and then translates it into multicolored light emitted by LEDs. Kristin Neidlinger created the sweater for her MFA design research at the California College of the Arts, but mainly as a practical device. It was developed for people who have conditions like autism or sensory processing disorder as a way to help them see how they are feeling and project those feelings to others around them. While Neidlinger says she thought of it as strictly a therapeutic device, the fashion industry started to notice it for both its technical and stylistic creativity. While the Mood Sweater is a totally foreign-looking object, fashions like the classic businesswear from the MIT-born Ministry of Supply take a more conservative, utilitarian approach. Inspired by mountain-climbing gear, its dress shirts and pants use fabric with heat-mapping technology that acts like a battery to absorb excess heat from the body and release it when needed in cooler atmospheres. CEO Gihan Amarasiriwardena tells me the company wants to make really comfortable clothing that doesn't just function for an office environment. ""Clothing is a very intricate part of our day,"" Gihan says,"" and we often overlook how much its performances affects our abilities during the day. People don't just have a day life or a work life — you live one life, and these technologies allow you to interact with the different environments you're constantly moving in and out of every day."" Currently, technology for fashion is both a means to an end and the end itself. Redefining fashion is about doing things that haven't been done before, and technology gives designers the tools to do this. Things like Sensoree's Mood Sweaters are weird and functional in ways fashion currently isn't, and that's a huge step forward towards the future identity of the industry. But at the same time, ways of integrating technology into fashion that are less obvious, like special fabrics and modernized production methods, will drastically change the ways things are done as well as how they look. ""I'm curious about what isn't there,"" Levine says. ""And I think people should think about that — it could give them the inspiration to create what isn't there."" Creating something that's never existed is both difficult and exciting. The revolution is just beginning, but fashion has the tools to redesign not only clothing but the process of making it. The things that made fashion fashion until this point are fading, and while traditionally designers have been plagued with the age-old question of form versus function, the next generation of designers will be asking a whole new question: why not both?

""I started in 2009 and have watched the first part (and trailers) of at least 1,000 Warner Bros. movies since,"" he told The Verge. The result is a brilliant look at a piece of branding that — like Universal's spinning globe and the mountains below Paramount's logo — became deeply ingrained in the minds of American moviegoers. ""During 90 years the Warner Bros. shield has undergone a series of refinements,"" reads the project's introduction. Many of those alterations came when the company fell under new ownership, which has happened numerous times during its storied history. But as you'll see below, Warner Bros. ultimately wound up not far from where it began. Hundreds of other examples can be seen at Annyas' website. As for why he did it, Annyas told The Verge, ""There wasn't a good overview of Warner Bros. logos yet."" He added, ""I hate when the internet is incomplete."" Special thanks to Christian Annyas for providing these high-res images.  This logo was seen at the end of some of the earliest Warner Bros. films, including 1927's The Jazz Singer. Even back in 1938, the company was willing to modify its logo for artistic purposes. Here's the emblem as it appeared in The Adventures of Robin Hood. By 1942's Casablanca, the Warner Bros. logo wasn't far off from what we know today. The WB logo was displayed atop a curtain for 1962's Gypsy. Toy marching band statuettes carry the Warner Bros. Pictures flag in The Music Man. When control of Warner Bros. Pictures was sold to control of the studio and its music business to Seven Arts Inc. in 1966, the logo went through a major redesign. Here the Warner Bros.-Seven Arts logo appears stylized ahead of 1969's Wild Bunch. This bland logo resulted when Kinney Services bought Warner Bros. Pictures in 1970. It appears here before Dirty Harry. Saul Bass designed this logo — a favorite of many — which was used between 1972 and 1984. By 1984's Gremlins, order had been restored and the logo reverted back to its classic style. Some custom logos were better than others. This version, for 2002's Scooby Doo, looks like an amateur Photoshop job. Things got better (and much darker) for Christopher Nolan's first Batman film, 2005's Batman Begins. The custom logo used for 2008's The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. Christopher Nolan yet again favored dark (and grayscale) for Inception. The Losers may have been a mediocre film, but the WB emblem looked great in this comic styling.

Inside, the curators do their best to keep it equally weird, rotating through a cast of global exhibitions with no permanent collection to draw on. Since the museum’s competing with at least half a dozen other New York institutions, that also means staying ahead of the pack with digital art and ambitious open installations. But while the museum tries to keep pace with a frenetic art world, one of its most ambitious ideas has overflowed the boxes and ended up in a non-descript building just to the south. ""We think we've hit on something that is very meaningful."" The new space is called New Inc. It's the first museum-led incubator, designed and built by the New Museum and opening for applications today. Despite the name, it isn't strictly an incubator in the traditional tech startup sense. There's no equity involved, and the project is designed to be a standalone non-profit. Instead, New Inc wants to replicate the development programs of a startup incubator, bringing in speakers and events, letting tech, art and design cross-pollinate into something larger and stranger. And with a reported $2 million in funding behind it, the New Museum has plenty of muscle to make it happen.  According to the museum's leaders, the idea has been a long time coming. They've always been interested in community work, drawing in like-minded thinkers with symposiums and hackathons. Dreaming up plans for a building they had acquired next door, creating a workspace seemed like a natural next step. ""We noticed an emergent field here in New York City,"" says New Museum deputy director Karen Wong, ""with the acceleration of these co-working spaces, tech incubators, different tribes coming together to share experiences."" The result is a surprisingly natural movement from creating a scene of artists and designers and technologists to simply creating a place where they can work. If you build a cool enough office, maybe the scene will build itself. ""We think we've hit on something that is very meaningful,"" Wong says. ""Like an entrepreneur, we've just brought it to market first."" a place where weirder ideas can flourish The incubator tag is, in part, a feint. Without a business focus or an equity handoff, New Inc will have little in common with the Y Combinator crowd — but the feint is part of the point. The new space wants to capture some of the magic places like Y Combinator have come to stand for, a place where smart and powerful people gather in one building to create amazing things. Part of it is also a concrete financial calculation. New York graduates more designers than anywhere else in the country, and most of them plan to stay in the city. At the same time, there's no obvious place for them in between corporate practices and shaggy art projects. The hope is that New Inc will provide a place where weirder ideas can gravitate and flourish. ""Breaking it apart, putting it back together, subverting it..."" And to choose the applicants and build that scene, the museum brought in Julia Kaganskiy, founder of the Arts Tech Meetup and former director of Intel and Vice's Creators Project, where she oversaw similar cross-pollinations. She says the ideal New Inc candidate will be more off-kilter than traditional workspaces might allow. ""Their approach to technology might be different from someone who’s a traditional product designer,"" Kaginskiy told us. ""They’re maybe breaking it apart, putting it back together, subverting it, inverting it, seeing what comes out of that."" ""Can they be inventing things that have cultural impact?"" More surprising for what's ostensibly a design studio is an emphasis on hardware. The new space is still under construction, but they've already made room for a dedicated prototyping lab, designed for fabricating architectural models and fiddling with circuit boards. ""We wanted to support different kinds of making, and that might include people working with sensors and microprocessors for a more environmental experience,"" Kaginskiy says. ""Having that capability felt really important."" It's still unclear exactly where New Inc will land between a simple co-working space and Y Combinator-esque cultural hub, but with enough designers caught between the art world and the tech world, something interesting is bound to come out of the project. ""We're sort of fascinated by the idea of incubating new ideas,"" Wong says. ""Can this group of people through the shared space, through the professional development, through our ability to connect folks and build a collaborative space, can they be inventing things that have cultural impact?""",0.7726519779250726,0.22734802207492744,0.541786210184301,772,5.1139896373056999,418,6.3971291866028706,1,0,"Design, Report"

According to The Wall Street Journal, Amazon is staffing up to test a new delivery service for its products there by bicycle that promises to get orders delivered to buyers within the hour. The Journal says it could be called Amazon Prime Now, and be available in Manhattan to start. Presumably it will also cost more than the company's same-day delivery service, which runs $5.99 per order for Prime members and $8.99 for everyone else.  It might be called ""Amazon Prime Now"" Amazon's been on a quest to trim delivery times for orders, including the possibility of using aerial drones to make short haul trips with small packages. However that effort remains years out, and requires advances in both the technology and regulatory approvals. The company has also attempted to add incentives to people who are willing to wait an extra day or two, or pick up packages in lockers placed in other businesses versus their home or office addresses. But, as the Journal points out, a one-hour service would be the fastest delivery service for Amazon yet, and in an enormous market. It also puts it in fierce contention with the likes of eBay, which launched a delivery service in 2012 that briefly promised one-hour deliveries for a flat $5 fee. The company has since scaled it back to same- and next-day shipping. That kind of time makes some items an impulse purchase, and puts on Amazon on better footing with physical stores where people could venture to get a similar deal.  It's unclear exactly when the service is launching, or if Amazon's planning to extend it beyond Manhattan and into other areas. Amazon is said to be holding time trials with bicycle courier companies before choosing one that will run the orders, suggesting there's still work to be done. Update December 8th, 5:44PM: A person familiar with Amazon's plans tells The Verge that the company's internal beta test of the service currently runs $5 for a one-hour delivery, while those who can wait two hours or more for a delivery can get it for free, but are encouraged to tip their delivery person.

Faced with another quarter of disappointing financial earnings, McDonald's is fast-tracking plans to let customers build their own burgers at its fast food locations. The ""Create Your Taste"" effort has been running at a small subset of McDonald's restaurants in California, but today the company announced a significant expansion that will bring it to 2,000 McD's locations in 2015. That's approximately one in every seven, as USA Today notes. For the more immediate future, Create Your Taste will be made available in 30 restaurants across Georgia, Illinois, Missouri, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. Custom burgers cost more and take longer to make Thankfully, building your ""dream"" McDonald's burger doesn't involve relaying every ingredient to someone at the order counter — a measure that preserves the sanity of customers and employees alike. The company uses touchscreen kiosks to let customers pick every ingredient (including a choice of bun, number of patties, and topping sauces) that will make up their burger. Spicy mayo, jalapeños, and grilled mushrooms are just a tap away. McDonald's also lets you build your own chicken sandwich, which is something not many fast food competitors can lay claim to. But in exchange for that total control, you should throw out the typical serving time expectations you've come to expect from fast food chains. McDonald's takes around seven minutes to fully prepare and serve up Create Your Taste burgers. The end goal is to make customers think they're eating something a step or three above your everyday double cheeseburger. That mission extends to presentation; instead of coming in a cardboard box or wax paper, burgers are dressed up gourmet-style. Oh, and you'll be paying way more, too. USA Today notes that a custom burger, fries, and a soda can average more than $8. Ultimately McDonald's hopes this focus on choice and quality will help stem the exodus of customers to Chipotle, Panera Bread, and other businesses luring consumers away from McDonald's for ""healthier"" options. Just don't expect to make your own burger from the drive-thru, where is where McDonald's makes the majority of its transactions; creative freedom requires eating in. And at that point, any illusion of a premium meal could quickly be lost.  ",0.44067293715749845,0.5593270628425016,0.23691971830210887,378,5.2063492063492065,249,5.9357429718875503,1,0,Business

I've invested more time and money in Hearthstone than I can really afford, and today my addiction is going to get much worse. The first major expansion for the game, Goblins vs Gnomes, is being released in the US today, and I'm shamelessly writing this article so that I can play it for hours and call it ""research"". Why didn't Magic figure this out?  The game mechanics for Hearthstone are heavily in debt to Magic: the Gathering. In both you draw creatures and spells from a deck, and use resources to cast them into play. You use those cards to attack your enemy, and the first one to run out of life points loses. I fell head over heels for Magic back in elementary school, and I've since sampled some of the digital versions for desktop PC, iPad, and Xbox, hoping to rekindle that passion. But none of them stuck with me, which made me wonder, why has Hearthstone succeeded where Magic has failed? Magic: the Gathering continues to attract legions of fans, and is in fact one of the biggest drivers of revenue growth at its parent company, Hasbro. But as my colleague TC Sottek pointed out recently, Magic has never managed to release a compelling version for online play, one that struck the right balance for veterans and beginners. In startup speak, you might say Magic has the problems of many successful incumbents, too mired in the complexity and legacy of its original blockbuster business to move nimbly into the future, too attached to its golden goose to risk making major change. A great online collectible card game needed to start from scratch To extend that tech metaphor, you might say Magic: the Gathering is the Microsoft of collectible card games: a relentlessly profitable behemoth who seems to have missed the boat on the latest industry shifts. A company that can't bear the idea of not charging for its core product, hobbled by debts to older form factors and a community of power-users it doesn't want to anger. That leaves a massive opportunity for a new challenger willing to wipe the slate clean and start from scratch. Enter Hearthstone. A game of Magic can take just a few minutes, but it can also drag out to an hour or more. Hearthstone strips away a lot of that overhead by keeping the deck sizes smaller and turning resources into something that automatically accrue each turn. In Hearthstone, unlike Magic, you can't make new plays during your opponent's turn, a truly asynchronous structure that speeds things up greatly. Hearthstone passed 20 million players in its first year No doubt many experienced collectible card game players will say that Hearthstone's variation on the format removes an essential complexity and nuance. But in my year of playing, and watching many Magic devotees who have become Hearthstone fans, it seems the game has actually found just the right balance between accessibility and depth. It's that one-two punch that allowed Hearthstone to sign up over 20 million players in its first year, but also attracted lots of pro gamers, who helped make it one of the most watched titles on Twitch. The weight of history is hard to shedOf course some of the issues with Magic that Hearthstone avoids are simply the downside of of age and success. After decades of releasing new sets, there are more than 10,000 cards in the Magic universe, and a dizzying array of rules and rule-breaking-exceptions to learn along with them. That's very intimidating for new players, especially when you're asking people to learn online with strangers, not face-to-face with another human in the comfort of a local comic or gaming shop. Hearthstone by contrast, currently has 500-700 cards you can collect and play, depending on how you count. That makes it much easier for rookies to get their head around what they're playing, and narrows the possible gap between the haves and the have nots. With each new expansion that comes out, the entire universe of what's possible radically shifts. Today, as Hearthstone players across the country scramble like mad to obtain and test out the new Goblins vs Gnomes cards, the playing field will be momentarily leveled, and I can mix it up with the pros, knowing that they didn't have bigger monsters or better spells, that they to were still figuring out how all this new stuff worked too. Old enough to repaint, but young enough to sell With Magic, each new expansion adds more flavor, and there are certainly new ideas and play mechanics that have the power to shake up how the game is played. But like a downhill snowball gaining in size, each expansion has less effect on the overall trajectory, less ability to impact the direction after so much inertia has been built. The flip side, of course, is that Magic has stayed popular for 20 years, and continues to grow. It's too soon to judge, but I wonder how many free-to-play digital games will be able to maintain that build that kind of legacy. Maybe 10 years from now it's possible Hearthstone will be just as massive, that it will be frighteningly complex and too indebted to long time players like myself to make dramatic changes. By that time we'll probably be discussing how to build the best CCG for virtual reality, or neural computing, and we'll wonder why Hearthstone can't keep up with these advances. That perfect mix of forethought, tactics, and luck All of which is to say that it's been amazing playing a great CCG online for the last year, and watching Hearthstone become a competitive phenomenon at a global scale. Of all the video and board games I've played, CCG's have my perfect mix of forethought, tactics, and luck, with a dash of addictive collectibility thrown in to seal the deal. Magic: the Gathering lit a spark in me unlike any other game I've played. For the roughly seven years I played it as a kid — before I regrettably decided to discard it so I could ""be cool"" — it was one of my most abiding passions, and the source of many nights of incredible entertainment. Hearthstone has struck that same chord, but tuned in a new key, for the current era.",0.5438747832542631,0.4561252167457369,0.14821671017833826,1088,4.7637867647058822,548,5.9032846715328464,0,0,

Its elegant mobile app for iPhone was built to appeal to a younger generation of investors, who would never pick up the phone to call a broker but might happily buy stocks if it could be done in just a few taps. The pitch proved irresistible to the half a million people who signed up on Robinhood’s waiting list, and the company has raised $16 million from investors including Index Ventures, Google Ventures, and Andreessen Horowitz. Today, Robinhood is officially opening for business — the company is rolling out access to everyone who signs up over the next couple of weeks. Buy and sells stocks for free, with just a few taps I’m no stock trader, but there's plenty to like about Robinhood’s app. A dead-simple interface lets you buy and sell stocks with a minimum of taps, and no fees. Elegant charts show you a stock’s performance over time; in a nice touch; the color of the sparkline changes from red to green when the markets are open. The app’s home screen shows you the performance of your entire portfolio.   So now anyone can actively manage their own stock portfolio — but whether you should is another story. Most studies of investor performance suggest the average person is far better off investing in index funds, which tend to track the market’s overall performance, than in individual stocks. Most people can’t time their trades well enough to take advantage of a stock’s highs and lows; one oft-cited academic paper on the subject is titled ""Trading Can Be Hazardous to Your Wealth."" (Its study of 66,465 households found that heavy traders earned an annual return of 11.4 percent, compared to the market’s returns of 17.9 percent.)   An Android version is coming Robinhood’s founders say that one reason investors tend to underperform the market is that they pay substantial fees to brokerages, which Robinhood largely eliminates. Instead, the company charges for the ability to buy stocks on ""margin,"" or credit, and also makes money by collecting interest on users’ cash balances. It also plans to offer premium advisory services. The lack of transaction fees may tempt you to make a lot of trades, but Robinhood's founders say they don't encourage any particular strategy. ""We by no means promote just an active investing strategy, or just a passive one,"" says Baiju Bhatt, a Robinhood co-founder. ""I think the ideal strategy is to do a little bit of both."" Bhatt suggests investors consider putting 70 percent of their money into diversified securities like index funds and actively manage the rest. Actively managing a stock portfolio brings on some risk, but millions of Americans do it already. And much of the existing mobile software on the market falls somewhere in between hideous and unusable. An Android version of Robinhood is coming in the first half of next year, and the company is also working on an API that would bring its trading functionality to other apps. Meanwhile, if you’re already making stock trades on your iPhone, Robinhood is well worth a look. And if you’re not, it might just get you hooked. Robinhood can be downloaded here.

Today the city announced that it's filed a lawsuit against the company, saying it's in violation of its rules and regulations, and asking for the company to immediately cease and desist its operations there. ""Our main concern is public health and safety, because the state invested in the cities the responsibility to do that,"" Portland's mayor Charlie Hales said in a statement. ""Beyond that, though, is the issue of fairness. Taxi cab companies follow rules on public health and safety. So do hotels and restaurants and construction companies and scores of other service providers. Because everyone agrees: good regulations make for a safer community. Uber disagrees, so we're seeking a court injunction."" ""Good regulations make for a safer community. Uber disagrees, so we're seeking a court injunction."" In a statement, Uber would not say whether it was continuing operations, but said it ""has received a tremendously warm welcome from riders and drivers in and around Portland."" The company also noted that it received close to 7,000 signatures from people (though not necessarily Portland residents) to its online petition that asks the city to allow it to run there. Uber and city officials had been in talks about launching the service there for months, when the company went ahead with the launch last week. City transportation officials responded by threatening steep fines for both drivers and Uber, but not passengers. If caught, fines run $1,500 for the company (for the first offense) and up to $2,250 for the driver. That can climb up to $5,000 for additional violations, making it a potentially wildly expensive endeavor. In a statement, Uber spokesperson Eva Behrend said the company ""stands by every driver partner and will fight unjust citations."" Enforcement of those citations was complicated in no small part because of Portland's proximity to neighboring cities where Uber is allowed, including right across the bridge in Vancouver, Washington. Drivers in those places can pick passengers up and drop them off into Portland within minutes, meaning return trips to those areas requires riding without a paid passenger. As with other instances, officials had concerns about Uber's handling of insurance and background checks from drivers, which are required for city taxi cab drivers. Traditional taxi companies require drivers to have certain rates of commercial insurance and annual background checks, whereas there's been less of a guarantee among transportation startups like Uber and Lyft, that initially ran with lower coverage than some cities required.

US Capitol Police in Washington, DC have detained a man after he flew a personal gyrocopter through restricted airspace and landed it on the West Lawn of the Capitol building. The strange incident led authorities to close off nearby streets and briefly put the Capitol on lockdown. Reports indicate that police arrived immediately after the pilot, 61-year-old Doug Hughes, touched down. Hughes is a US postal worker from Ruskin, Florida, according to the Tampa Bay Times, and orchestrated the stunt as his own attempt to protest government corruption and urge lawmakers to advance campaign finance reform. My husband just got buzzed by this mini aircraft walking on the National Mall in #WashingtonDC. He saw it land down by the Capitol building. How crazy is that?! True story!

He's kept the Tampa Bay newspaper apprised of his secret plan leading up to today, but hid everything from his own family. ""We can have a government that works for the people, that answers to the people, that can only take money from the people in small amounts."" Hughes put these and similar thoughts in letters addressed to all 535 members of Congress — and yes, the mailman brought them all along on the gyrocopter trip in hopes they'd be delivered to lawmakers. He even bought $250 worth of stamps. ""I don't believe that the authorities are going to shoot down a 61-year-old mailman in a flying bicycle."" Before heading 300 feet in the air, Hughes told the Times that he was concerned about being injured or killed as a result of his defiant act. The US Secret Service was apparently tipped off that he was planning something like this last year; an agent questioned Hughes at his home (the agency knew about his gyrocopter) and also visited Hughes at the post office to talk with his co-workers. The Secret Service eventually backed off, presumably finding that Hughes wasn't any threat to national security.  But clearly he was very serious about making headlines in hopes of starting a conversation about corruption. Will one man's gyrocopter flight accomplish that? Unlikely. But at least no one got hurt or worse.

In a congressional briefing broadcast on Periscope, Quinn and her fellow speakers addressed the ongoing problems of cyberstalking, revenge porn, doxxing, and crowdsourced hate, while reiterating some solutions for solving them. Today's briefing was held by the National Task Force to End Sexual and Domestic Violence, the National Council of Women’s Organizations, and the National Organization for Women, in partnership with Massachusetts Representative Katherine Clark. Quinn, who has been outspoken in her criticism of GamerGate despite subsequent rape and death threats, spoke about how the difficulty that comes with speaking out against abuse. ""It’s difficult to speak out if you don’t have the support to speak out,"" she said. The developer has already pushed to make it easier for victims of abuse to press the issue, launching Crash Override, an anti-abuse task force, earlier this year. ""It's difficult to speak out if you don't have the support to speak out."" Quinn was joined by three other experts in the field: Michelle Garcia, director of the Stalking Resource Center; John Wilkinson, attorney advisor at AEquitas: The Prosecutors' Resource on Violence Against Women; and Danielle Keats Citron, author of Hate Crimes in Cyberspace. The conversation touched on a variety of topics, including the conviction of revenge porn site operator Kevin Bollaert earlier this month. Keats Citron, who in a Vox interview argued that the online harassment of women is now a civil rights issue, stated that she's looking for retooled laws that criminalize breaches of confidence, a much stronger charge than the breaches of copyright that forced Reddit to move against last summer's massive nude picture leak. Quinn, along with other prominent critics like Anita Sarkeesian and Brianna Wu, has helped push conversations about online harassment mainstream, forcing the GamerGate movement back to the fringes. Critics did manage to hijack the briefing's hashtag, #StopWebH8, but hopefully gaining the attention of lawmakers in Congress matters more than internet invective.",0.5995048980449217,0.4004951019550783,0.8331620806379788,348,5.5660919540229887,233,6.5107296137339059,0,0,"Culture, Gaming, Policy & Law, US & World"
