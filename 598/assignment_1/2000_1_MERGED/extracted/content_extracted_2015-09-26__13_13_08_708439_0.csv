By screening more than 2,500 existing drugs, scientists have identified 30 FDA-approved drugs that appeared to kill the Ebola virus in cultured cells. Among then, the antidepressant Zoloft and heart disease drug Vascor were able to stop the virus from reproducing in rodents as well. The findings, published today in Science Translation Medicine, are tentative but also encouraging. Developing new drugs takes a lot of time and money, and repurposing old ones that are already approved by the FDA could really speed things up. 70 percent of the mice on Zoloft survivedThe current epidemic in West Africa is the largest on record. Since its beginning, more than 27,100 people have been infected, causing about 11,100 deaths. There is no approved drug for Ebola right now, so researchers have tried to develop new treatments and vaccines to fight the outbreak — as well as future ones.  But some have turned to investigating older ones that are intended for other purposes. These drugs ""are ideal since they have known clinical data and safety profiles in humans,"" explains Gene Olinger, a virologist at the US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases, and a co-author of the study. To find out if existing drugs could be used against Ebola, Olinger and his team of researchers screened thousands of drugs against cells that had been infected with Ebola. Out of the lot, 30 drugs were able to kill the Ebola virus in a cell culture. But two drugs, drugs known as Zoloft and Vascor, were the most promising. They block the virus's ability to enter, replicate in, and exit infected cells. To further investigate the two drugs, researchers tested them in rodents. Both were able to protect mice from Ebola. About 70 percent of mice treated with Zoloft survived, whereas all the mice that were given Vascor survived. ""The findings are interesting, but without an evaluation of these most promising drugs in the nonhuman primate model it is hard to make much of it,"" says Thomas Geisbert, an immunologist at the University of Texas who didn’t participate in the work. The science behind the study is sound and the researchers are ""good scientists,"" he told The Verge in an email, but finding a drug that works against Ebola in humans is ""no small task."" ""The odds of finding anything as efficacious as ZMapp or TKM-Ebola are very remote.""""I and others have shelves and shelves full of things that show some in vitro activity against Ebola and of those, there are dozens or so that can protect mice,"" Geisbert says. Unfortunately, of all the drugs that protect rodents, ZMapp and TKM-Ebola are the only ones that work well in nonhuman primates so far. ""Given the number of drugs that have been screened for Ebola over the years, the odds of finding anything as efficacious as ZMapp or TKM-Ebola are very remote."" Olinger and his team already have plans to try the drugs in larger animals. They also want to try using Zoloft and Vascor in combination with other drugs. ""Viruses are often difficult to stop,"" so an approach that combines different drugs might be more effective, Olinger says. Drugs take 10 years and ""more than a billion dollars to develop.""Emerging pathogens, especially viruses, are a threat to humans and animals — and researchers have few drugs to offer the clinicians that treat them, Olinger says. Drugs that have already been approved for use in humans therefore present an opportunity. If they can be repurposed during emergencies, scientists might be able to tip the balance in our favor. ""This is especially important given that drugs typically take 10 years and more than a billion dollars to develop,"" Olinger says. It’s the kind of approach that can provide solutions while researchers work toward finding new, better drugs. ""We hope that [this study], including sharing our whole data set, will spur and incentivize our colleagues to consider these drugs"" so that they can be used in future outbreaks, Olinger says. Of course, governments and health organizations will have to invest in basic and applied research if they want that approach to work.

In an 18-6 vote, the committee decided to recommend that the FDA approve the drug, Flibanserin, given certain labeling and risk management conditions, The Washington Post reports. Flibanserin, developed by Sprout Pharmaceuticals, works by boosting the response of receptors in the brain to chemicals like serotonin and dopamine. It's suggested for women who suffer from Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder, a condition described at the advisory meeting as feeling like ""a switch had gone off."" ""A challenging risk / benefit assessment"" But there are concerns about the drug, which the FDA has described as having ""a challenging risk / benefit assessment."" Sprout Pharmaceuticals said that in a 24-week clinical trial, 46 to 60 percent of women benefitted from the treatment, but detractors argue that if the placebo effect is taken into consideration only 10 percent of women actually benefitted. Other trials saw a negligible increase in the amount of sex couples had while one partner was taking Flibanserin. One trial saw an increase from only two to three times per month, New Scientist reports. The FDA panel described the drug's benefit as ""moderate"" or ""marginal,"" the Post reports. There are risks beyond the fact that the drug might just not work. Flibanserin has been found to interact poorly with alcohol and birth control pills, leading to side-effects like fatigue, dizziness, and nausea. A two-year study of the drug found an increased breast cancer risk in mice who were given four times the therapeutic dose of 100 milligrams per day. Despite the fact that Flibanserin has not been proven to be wholly beneficial, some doctors who testified at the FDA committee hearing today argued it was better than nothing. One medical practitioner said when female patients come to her looking for help, she has no real solutions to offer them. ""This is all I can tell them,"" she said, according to the Post. The FDA approved the commercial use of Viagra in 1998, but it has yet to approve a similar libido booster for women. Viagra did try to expand its use to women in 1999, but it didn't work the same way it did for men. Some argue it's better than nothing Impotence in men is not the same thing as low sex drive in women. Though men and women can both see a decrease in sex drive due to a number of factors, low sex drive in women tends to be more closely related to stress and relationship issues, AP reports. And whereas Viagra increases blood flow to the genitals, Flibanserin alters chemical function in the brain. Unlike Viagra, Flibanserin would need to be taken daily, regardless of whether or not the woman taking it wanted to have sex that day. Flibanerin has been rejected by the FDA twice before, in 2010 and 2013, but Sprout Pharmaceuticals has continued to aggressively resubmit the drug. The advisory committee will now work on setting the conditions that will need to accompany FDA approval.",0.22362342544428587,0.7763765745557141,0.8552182634431181,522,4.9176245210727974,299,5.896321070234114,0,0,Science

But in its latest report, the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics sheds light on their male partners instead. And drawing on survey data from thousands of men, it concludes that unmarried fatherhood could be on the decline. Previous studies show that while the rate of out-of-wedlock births grew over the second half of the 20th century, it started dropping again in the early 21st. Currently, the CDC says that around 40 percent of all births in the US are to unmarried parents. But that doesn't tell us how many fathers are postponing or eschewing marriage, nor does tracking the demographics of single moms alone. ""You get a slightly different view of the story than when you just look at women's information,"" says study author Gladys Martinez. ""They do not marry men exactly their age. They do not have children exactly with men of their age.""   Instead, the NCHS looked at three decades' worth of records from the National Survey of Family Growth, which tracks things like pregnancy, contraceptive use, and men and women's health. It restricted its search to fathers between 15 and 44 years old and only looked at their first child, something Martinez says was done in order to eliminate extra variables like birth order. From 1980 to 1989, 42 percent of the fathers hadn't married when their first child was born. That number went down only slightly in the '90s, but over the next decade, it dipped to 36 percent. Unmarried fathers are more likely to be living with a partner""For women, we see that there's been a decline in the rate of non-marital childbearing, so [the numbers are] kind of comparable,"" says Martinez. That decline, though, is fairly recent — it peaked around 2008. ""I was actually very surprised,"" says Lenna Nepomnyaschy, an associate professor who works on family policy at Rutgers and was not involved in this study. ""Given the national figures for the proportion of all births that are to  non-married mothers — those have been going up over the last three  decades."" Both she and Martinez agree that it's difficult to draw direct comparisons with other studies, though. They might address the same questions, but they're looking at different kinds of data, especially because it only counts first births. It does reflect one major change that other studies have found: a slowly growing number of parents are choosing to live together without marrying. When people think of unmarried parents, ""they assume that most of that is the mother by herself,"" says Martinez. ""Looking at the increases at cohabitation, that shows you that that's not really true."" Nineteen percent of unwed fathers were living with their partners in the '80s, compared to 24 percent in the '00s. They're also getting older. Where less than a 10th of unmarried fathers (not fathers in general) were 25 or older at the start of the study, they now make up a third of the group. Martinez cautions that this could be the result of an aging population, not a fundamental change in how people think about marriage or reproduction, but more research would be required.   The survey found significant differences in race and ethnicity. For all three decades, over half of black and Hispanic fathers were unmarried, compared to between a third and a quarter of white ones. While the percentage of unmarried black fathers is still highest, though, it's actually dropped significantly, from 77 percent in the '80s to 66 percent by the '00s. Understanding the roots of these changes is the next stepIt will take more work to figure out what's caused these changes, but ultimately, Martinez hopes this study will help improve the lives of these fathers' children — other research suggests that whatever the cause, children born to unmarried parents can have a higher risk of health problems, at least in the US. ""There is no reason that children being raised by cohabiting parents should be any worse off than children being raised by married parents,"" says Nepomnyaschy, pointing to countries in Europe with extremely low marriage rates. ""The problem is that in the US, people who cohabit instead of getting married tend to be lower-educated, tend to have lower incomes, and those relationships tend to be less stable."" This increases financial pressure and, if the relationship breaks up, could leave one parent — usually the mother, even with single-father households getting more common — trying to take care of a child without support. Policies that promote paid parental leave, access to child care and health care, and access to higher education could all help alleviate these pressures, but they won't necessarily increase fathers' involvement. ""Few of the responsible fatherhood programs have made much of a  difference,"" says Nepomnyaschy.  ""It would be important to understand whether broad economic and social  policies (that are not specifically aimed at fathers) might have more  impact on getting men to get married or getting fathers to be more  involved with their children."" This could include reforming the prison  system and helping reintegrate men coming out of it, or increasing the  minimum wage overall. Even if the final policies don't focus directly on fathers, though, this survey is a step toward figuring out what works.",0.619603273659631,0.38039672634036903,0.5355752411238349,905,5.0011049723756908,486,6.1069958847736627,0,4,"Science, Report"

Wouldn’t it be nice if you could just find out? According to a new study in Science, researchers have devised a blood test that can do just that by identifying the viruses that your immune system has fought in the past. The test is in its infancy, but it’s already giving us some insight into just how similar people’s immune systems are — despite the large geographic distances that can separate them.  Humans have ""immunological memory""Humans have ""immunological memory,"" meaning that our immune cells remember all the viruses we’ve encountered in the past. It's a biological system that helps speed up our immune response during future encounters with the same virus. Researchers tapped this memory tool to figure out virus infection histories for over 500 people across four continents. First, researchers created a ""viral library"" from a public database of protein sequences belonging to all the viruses that are known to infect humans. The main step in this process was introducing lab-made pieces of virus DNA into ""bacteriophages,"" or viruses that infect bacteria. Thanks to this genetic engineering trick, the bacteriophages displayed a synthetic representation, or marker, of a given virus’s proteins on their surface — proteins that a person's immune system would only recognize if they had already encountered the virus. The researchers then mixed the bacteriophages with a sample of the participants’ blood. By identifying the virus markers that a participant’s antibodies stuck to, they were able to infer which viruses had previously infected them. ""We've created this huge pond full of all possible human viruses."" ""You could think of it as we're fishing with bait — the bait is the patient's antibodies — and we've created this huge pond full of all possible human viruses,"" says Benjamin Larman, an immunopathologist at Johns Hopkins University and a co-author of the study. ""We're using the patient's antibodies to pull out the viruses that they've been infected with."" On average, researchers detected immune system responses to 10 viral species per person, though two individuals displayed antibody responses to 84 species of viruses. Larman and his team also found that the number of viruses detected by a person's immune system varies according to age, HIV status, and geography. The virus that came up the most often was the Epstein-Barr virus, which is responsible for mononucleosis. Two individuals displayed antibody responses to 84 species of viruses At its heart, this study is a technology development paper, Larman says. Doing this a few years ago wouldn’t have been possible, but recent advances in DNA synthesis and sequencing have allowed researchers to create this new method, called ""VirScan."" The study is ""a great demonstration of the power of new DNA synthesis and sequencing technologies to address biological questions at a very large scale not previously possible,"" says Timothy Lu, a biological engineer at MIT, who didn’t participate in the study. The work also presents ""a powerful platform for studying the human antiviral repertoire,"" he says. The test is cheap — analyzing a blood sample costs $25 — and 100 samples  can be processed in a single week. But VirScan won’t be available to the public for a number of years; the FDA regulatory process requires validation through further experiments. And, in truth, this might not be  the type of test that gets used by doctors right away. For many,  knowing which viruses you’ve survived will be a novelty. That said, the test will certainly help researchers get a better understanding of ways in which humans respond to virus infection. And eventually, Larman and his  team would like to create a simpler test that could be used in a clinic to improve infection diagnosis. But again, that's a long way off — Larman estimates that general adoption of the technology is roughly five to 10 years out. ""[Can't] use the current library to identify new viruses."" The study was small, which means that some findings might change as more people take the test. In addition, as researchers discover new viruses, the library will grow and yield more data. This is a huge strength, but it also demonstrates one of the study's main limitations. ""We can only find responses to viruses that we already know about,"" Larman says. ""So we're not going to be able to use the current library to identify new viruses."" There's a lot to be learned from the library in its current form, however. Being able to look at infections from people around the world means that researchers could ask if geography has an impact on people's responses to various infections. For instance, a researcher could ask if antibodies belonging to people in Asia stick to the same markers on a virus’s surface compared with people in Canada. Researchers could also try to see if the occurrence of certain viruses correlate with other types of disease, Larman suggests. This geographical bent is what Larman finds most intriguing about the work. So far, the study shows that antibodies that humans generate operate ""in almost indistinguishable ways, on average"" in response to a virus. ""There are some exceptions but the similarity is really quite striking, whether they're in Africa, Thailand, or the United States,"" he says. ""People have seen glimpses of this in the past, but this is certainly the most comprehensive analysis of this phenomenon."" Correction: A previous version of this article stated that bacteriophages are bacteria that infect viruses. This is incorrect. Bacteriophages are viruses that infect bacteria. We regret the error.

It's a rat's forearm and hand, and it looks a little smaller than an adult human's thumb. Researchers are hopeful this could be the first step toward growing fully functional limbs in labs. ""We're focusing on the forearm and hand to use it as a model system and proof of principle,"" Harald Ott, the researcher who grew the limb, told New Scientist. ""But the techniques would apply equally to legs, arms, and other extremities."" There's still a long way to go Ott, a thoracic surgeon, used a process of decellularization and recellularization to grow the limb. First, he stripped living cells from the limbs of dead rats to expose their ""scaffolds,"" or inert protein collagen. The rat's forearm ""scaffold"" included the collagen structures that make up blood vessels, tendons, muscles, and bone, New Scientist reports. Then, for the recellularization process, Ott seeded those collagen structures with cells from the recipient. The seeded scaffolding was then nursed in a bioreactor and given nutrients, oxygen, and electrical stimulation, which allowed blood vessels and muscles to regenerate. After the limb was in the bioreactor for about two to three weeks, Ott coated the limb, which doesn't have bones or cartilage, with skin grafts.  Once the process is complete, none of the original donor's soft tissue remains. Because the limb is grown using only the recipient's cells, a biolimb would likely negate the need for immunosuppression, which prevents the body's rejection of an artificial limb. Although the biolimb is an encouraging first step towards growing fully functional human limbs, scientists note there is still a long way to go. ""It's a very exciting development, but the challenge will be to create a functioning limb,"" Daniel Weiss, a researcher at the University of Vermont College of Medicine, told New Scientist. The rat limb can respond to stimuli and circulate blood, but it's not clear yet if the muscle can function on its own. Using electrical pulses to activate the muscles, Ott found that the rat's hand could clench and unclench. He also attached the limb to anesthetized living rats and found it was able to circulate blood, but he didn't test for muscle movement. The limb still needs to be seeded with bone and cartilage to see if those cells can regenerate, and the researchers need to prove that a nervous system can develop around the biolimb. The muscle might not be able to function on its own Decellularization, or decel, has been used to grow hearts and lungs, and simpler structures like windpipes have been grown and used in human transplants. But a hand has many more cell types and nerves than something like a windpipe, making it much more difficult to grow in a lab.

In 2013, a landmark UN report on climate change described a strange contradiction: greenhouse gases were still on the rise, but Earth's surface temperatures hadn't increased as fast as expected. Researchers have spent years trying to explain this phenomenon, dubbed a ""global warming hiatus,"" while skeptics have seized upon it as evidence that warnings about human-driven climate change were overblown. But a new report suggests that there was no significant decrease in global warming over the last 15 years. In short, the hiatus never happened. This result directly challenges what the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) concluded in 2013, when it reported that global temperatures rose at a far lower rate between 1998 and 2012 than from 1951 to 2012 (0.05°C per decade compared to 0.12°C per decade). According to the authors of today's study, however, the IPCC's data was flawed. Using corrected measurements and more recent data, they find that temperatures rose at a rate of 0.106°C per decade between 1998 and 2014, more than twice the rate they reported with older data and without adjusting for biases. That's also on par with the 0.113°C rate they report for 1950 to 1999. ""There was never a hiatus to begin with."" ""Our analysis tells us that there was never a hiatus to begin with,"" says Russell Vose, head of climate science at the National Climatic Data Center at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and a co-author of today's study. In its 2013 report, the IPCC acknowledged that 15-year hiatuses are ""common"" in historical records, suggesting that the apparent decline may be due to natural weather variations. But the evidence was perplexing given the ongoing rise in heat-trapping greenhouse gases, and because it contradicted most computer projections. Several studies have suggested that the increased heat absorbed by deep oceans may be to blame, while others have pointed to volcanic activity, lower solar energy levels, or air pollution. The NOAA study would appear to undermine these hiatus studies, but Vose says that's not the case. ""If those various factors weren't operating during that period of time, we might actually have seen even more warming,"" he says.  (NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information) The results come as surface temperature datasets are expanding to cover more weather observation stations, resulting in more accurate readings. The authors analyzed more than double the amount of data previously compiled by the NOAA, from buoys and commercial ships as well as the land surface. In doing so, they took into account the variations on how ships and buoys collect ocean temperatures as well as the recent increase in land observation stations — factors that the IPCC did not consider. ""The fact that such small changes to the analysis make the difference between a hiatus or not merely underlines how fragile a concept it was in the first place,"" says Gavin Schmidt, a climate scientist at the Columbia University Earth Institute who was not involved in today's study. For some climate scientists, the notion of a recent hiatus was always tenuous, if not a red herring. As they have pointed out, overall temperatures still rose during the supposed hiatus period, and the 15-year time frame was too short to separate signal from noise. ""This paper will have very significant policy implications."" ""I think for scientists, the hiatus was not regarded as something that was fundamentally changing the picture of global warming,"" says Ronald Prinn, a professor of atmospheric science at MIT, who was not involved in the NOAA study. But he says it could have stronger repercussions at the political level, since climate change skeptics may no longer be able to point to the hiatus to make their case. ""I think that this paper will have very significant policy implications,"" he adds. But there are still some major gaps that remain to be filled. Experts say the relative lack of temperature data from the Arctic is most glaring, as the authors acknowledge, since that region has warmed much faster than the rest of the globe. Others argue that using 1950 as a baseline year is misleading, since global warming didn't accelerate until the 1970s. But for those who never bought into the hiatus to begin with, today's findings are a welcomed affirmation. ""I hope that this study helps to put this false idea of a hiatus to rest,"" says Stefan Rahmstorf, a professor of ocean physics at Germany's Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, who was not involved in the study. ""It didn't have any merit in the first place.""",0.36944563869641495,0.6305543613035851,0.20354872357475615,797,5.1041405269761606,416,6.2475961538461542,1,2,"Science, Report"

In the past year, half of American adults had their personal information exposed as a result of hacks, The New York Times reported last month. And yet while every hack produces anguished headlines and hand-wringing, the impact of the data breaches on average people is small. Hackers may gain access to your email address, or your phone number, or an encrypted password. But any financial losses are typically absorbed by your bank. We glance at the headlines, change our passwords, and await the next minor inconvenience. The apparent release last night of personal information for 32 million registered users of AshleyMadison.com, a website for connecting people who want to have affairs, is likely to have much more profound consequences. Impact Team, the group of anonymous hackers who are taking credit for the breach, sought to have Ashley Madison’s website taken down in protest of the company’s business practices and its encouragement of adultery. But the practical impact of the breach is likely to be much broader. There are a lot of threads here, and it’s worth sorting them out. The consequences for Ashley Madison are likely to be catastrophic The consequences for Ashley Madison are likely to be catastrophic. A CEO who routinely bragged about the company’s privacy features now seems likely to face a barrage of lawsuits from members who have found their information exposed. And a site that depends on privacy and security to earn members’ trust may find it impossible to win it back. The legal consequences are likely to extend beyond lawsuits. As The Washington Post noted, adultery is a crime in the military, and thousands of Ashley Madison users had email addresses from the .mil domain. It’s impossible to say how many of the addresses are valid — Ashley Madison did not require users to verify their email addresses. But under military rules, service members found guilty of philandering can be punished by a year of confinement. They’re also subject to a dishonorable discharge, which would mean losing their pension. For registered members of the site, the personal consequences could be dire. The data dump has already been turned into a searchable database, and the search results will be devastating. For some, it will confirm suspicions; for others who decide to check it on a lark, it may raise awful new questions. And that's true even though simply being registered for Ashley Madison tells you very little about a person. People have all sorts of arrangements in their relationships, and odds are they don't share that information with their friends and family. Put another way: plenty of people were using Ashley Madison with their partners' consent. It’s likely that millions more people who registered for Ashley Madison never consummated an affair — among other things, the ratio of men to women on the site was roughly six to one, according to an analysis of the Impact Team data. That said, millions of people likely did use the site to seek partners outside their relationships. The cheaters will despair; relationships will end; children’s lives could be affected for the worse. People could lose their jobs as a result And the pain won’t end there — certain employers will react negatively to the knowledge that their employees were using the site, and people could lose their jobs as a result. Government employees who could become subject to blackmail, schoolteachers in more conservative districts, elected officials, CEOs — all of these could face professional consequences, along with anyone else who has a morals clause in their employment contract. And the results could follow them — expect this data to become included as a part of pre-employment background checks for years to come. For those who never signed up for Ashley Madison, or had a partner who did, ethical questions will still come fast and furious. As John Herrman notes at The Awl, many of us will feel tempted to see which of our friends, family members, and coworkers may have registered for the site. When Target was hacked, few would have cared if it resulted in their purchase history being made searchable. Looking through the Ashley Madison data will be at least as tempting as looking through the leaked nude celebrity photos of last fall’s Celebgate hack. Only this time you’ll likely be looking not for a celebrity, but for someone you know. And what if you find something? How will you react? How will the person you’re snooping on? At various times, all of us are terrible in our own ways. What happens when those ways are easily searched on a public database? What if you find something? How will you react? The worst impact of the Ashley Madison breach will surely be personal: while incredibly common, cheating also upends people’s lives and can lead to personal and professional ruin. Hopefully it leads companies to adopt better privacy and security practices — Ashley Madison, for all its boasting, made several crucial errors in attempting to keep members’ information anonymous. But if we’ve learned anything from the never-ending series of data breaches, it’s that over a long enough time period, all sites are likely to fall victim to hackers. And this raises yet more questions. In a world where we expect more of our communications to eventually be made public, will we begin to abandon certain apps or services en masse? Is it truly our responsibility to act as if everything we say will eventually become public, or can we hold companies responsible when they fail to protect our data? Can we pressure companies to purge more of our data on a regular basis, limiting our exposure risk in the likelihood of an eventual hack? Or will we once again shrug our shoulders at the seeming hopelessness of it all? At this early stage, it’s impossible to say. And so we sit and stew about a future that could someday come to include a searchable online database of our emails, or our text messages, or our Tinder chats. We can hope that future never comes about, even though it seems to grow closer with every passing hack. In the meantime, two old adages would seem to apply. So prepare for the worst.

Daimler, which owns Freightliner, says it has done more than 10,000 miles of testing on the truck. And now it's street-legal, having been officially granted one of Nevada's ""Autonomous Vehicle"" license plates (the first for a commercial truck) by Nevada governor Brian Sandoval at a media event before the unveiling.  The Inspiration Truck and Daimler's underlying ""Highway Pilot"" technology isn't meant to replace truck drivers completely. Instead, it's meant to solve the problem of fatigued driving, something that plagues truck drivers who have to pull long shifts. According to Daimler, 90 percent of truck crashes result from driver error, and in one out of every eight of those cases driver fatigue plays a role.  Dr. Wolfgang Bernhard, Daimler AG's truck boss, says that the Inspiration Truck mitigates that problem significantly. At a media event before the unveiling, he spoke about how taking control away from drivers positively impacts their ability to focus for long periods of time. ""We measured brain activity with or without autonomous function, and it clearly shows that driver drowsiness decreases by about 25 percent when the truck is operating in autonomous mode,"" he said.   Daimler and Freightliner chose Nevada as the venue for the unveiling because the state was the first in the nation to put regulations in place that allow the testing of autonomous vehicles. (Three others and the District of Columbia have since followed.) Nevada is also home to some of the first university curriculums dealing with autonomous vehicles, like the Nevada Advanced Autonomous Innovations Center found at the University of Nevada, Reno. The Inspiration Truck is considered ""level 3"" on NHTSA's automation scale. That's the second-highest level of automation — the same that Google's self-driving cars currently operate on. It means that the vehicle is advanced enough to enable the driver to cede full control in certain traffic or environmental conditions. The driver can interrupt and regain control, but the vehicle should allow a ""comfortable transition time."" As with other self-driving cars, that level of automation brings up a number of issues, some of which were discussed earlier in the day. A big one is liability — if the driver is ceding control to an automated system, where does the blame get placed if something goes wrong? Bernhard compared it to the control a pilot has over a commercial airliner. ""Technically speaking these vehicles are operating 'partly automated,'"" he said. ""So [the driver] is still in charge of what happens. He’s responsible."" Martin Daum, the president and CEO of Daimler Trucks, hedged on that answer slightly more, saying that liability is not a question for today, but for the future. ""Certainly before it becomes mass production the liability question has to be discussed and has to be solved by the regulators,"" Daum said. ""Ultimately it’s the people — like with any law — it’s the people that decide and the industry has to follow.""   Another big issue is whether the Inspiration Truck will need any additional infrastructure as its production scales up. Bernhard said no, and he and the company plan to show us what he means at a much more hands-on event later today. The only thing that can assist them right now are the white guidelines painted onto the roads, which he claims are ""fully intact"" or can be repaired at a low cost in many states. While things like a broader infrastructure or vehicle-to-vehicle communication would bring additional benefits, the Inspiration Truck can operate at level 3 autonomy without any extra help. ""That vehicle does not need any support other than nice white stripes,"" he said. We saw another one of Daimler's divisions tease its own autonomous truck last October when Mercedes announced the ""Future Truck 2025."" According to Daimler, the ""Highway Pilot"" technology behind the Mercedes version is the same that powers the Inspiration Truck, though the designs are very different — the Future Truck 2025 is thoroughly conceptual and futuristic, while Freightliner's version looks like it could roll down the highway today. And, in fact, it did at the end of the media preview at Las Vegas Motor Speedway. With Bernhard at the wheel, he and Nevada's governor Brian Sandoval drove the truck right off the premises — though it's uncertain if they let the truck take over once they were on the road. ""Obviously there's some more testing we have to do,"" Bernhard said. ""We have to see how this thing performs in the rain, the sun, cold days, or at subzero."" That's something that Daimler will have to wait for, as other states could be slow to adapt the same self-driving-friendly regulation that Nevada already has. Bernhard also pointed out that just getting a ""patchwork of states"" on board won't help — particularly since big rigs often operate interstate — and as Daum sees it, state regulation is just the beginning. Federal regulation will be necessary before we see a fleet of Inspiration Trucks (or other trucks running Daimler's Highway Pilot technology) swarm the highways. The Freightliner Inspiration Truck is a modified version of the company's ""Cascadia Evolution"" model. Most of the truck is the same, with the exception of the Highway Pilot automation technology. Perhaps the most striking thing about the Inspiration Truck is how much it looks like Freightliner's non-autonomous offerings.  The non-autonomous version of Freightliner's truck is already the most fuel-efficient truck on the NAFTA market, according to Daimler. Radar and a stereo camera are used in conjunction with adaptive cruise control to guide the truck when the driver isn't at the wheel. Nevada has officially licensed two Inspiration Trucks for regular operation on public roads for now. Further adoption somewhat depends on how quickly other states loosen regulations on autonomous vehicles.   The Inspiration Trucks are “partly automated,” which means when the driver takes his hands off the steering wheel and feet of the pedals the vehicle takes over.  Similar to how the autopilot systems work on commercial airplanes, the driver still monitors what’s going on, and is considered in charge of what happens on the road. The initial unveiling happened in a lot adjacent to the Las Vegas Motor Speedway. ""We’re going to show you trucking can be just as exciting as racing,"" said Florian Martens, Daimler's director of global communications. ""And maybe even more so."" A large gathering of press members were on hand to see the initial unveiling at Las Vegas Motor Speedway. Nevada governor Brian Sandoval and Daimler's Wolfgang Bernhard climbed into the Inspiration Truck at the end of the press event and drove it out onto the streets of Las Vegas. Bernhard waves to the press as he drives the truck out of the makeshift pavilion. The truck was under a massive car cover before the press event began.  Governor Sandoval spoke before the initial unveiling. ""Thank you for looking at the impossible and finding a safe way to make it possible,"" he said.  Nevada is one of the pioneering states when it comes to autonomous driving. Governor Sandoval said that the Freightliner announcement will help his state ""sustain the impressive pace of this tech."" Daimler's Wolfgang Bernhard said he believes that autonomous capabilities will improve the job of a truck driver. ""It’s less fatiguing. It makes his life and his job much more attractive.""

The company has launched five of its Falcon 9 rockets — which matches the amount sent into space in all of 2014 — and it’s getting closer and closer to landing the first reusable rocket stage ever. The next test of that system won’t come until June, but today the company has an important test of a different kind. SpaceX will test its ""pad abort"" system, the company’s back-up plan in case of a launchpad emergency when it attempts to send astronauts to the International Space Station in a few years. The pad abort test will last just 107 seconds, and SpaceX will fire eight ""SuperDraco"" engines (which we saw the company test back in March) for just six of those seconds. NASA will provide live-streaming coverage of the test, which was originally scheduled to begin at 6:35AM ET but has now been pushed back to 9:00AM ET. During the test, the SuperDracos will propel the Dragon spacecraft more than one-third of a mile away from the Falcon 9 in just five seconds. After reaching a peak altitude of nearly a mile, the spacecraft will rotate until the heat shield points down, and small ""drogue"" parachutes will stabilize the craft. Those will give way to three main parachutes, and less than two minutes after the SuperDracos fire, the capsule should splash down in the Atlantic Ocean 1.4 miles from the Cape Canaveral launch pad.   The abort system works much like a fighter pilot's ejector seat, except the entire craft is ejected instead of just the crew. And while today's test will focus only on a launchpad abort, the system allows for an abort to be executed all the way until the craft is in orbit. (An in-flight abort test is scheduled for later this year.) The attempt is the most important milestone in the company's plan to send humans to space since it was awarded part of NASA’s Commercial Crew contract last fall. Back then, NASA chose designs from SpaceX and Boeing, and awarded the agency’s largest contracts ever — $2.6 billion and $4.2 billion, respectively — to have crewed capsules ready by 2017. For its entry, SpaceX decided to repurpose the design of its Dragon cargo capsule, which has already proven to be reliable after six successful missions to the space station. Boeing, on the other hand, is developing its spacecraft (called the CST-100) from the ground up. Hold down firing of Dragon 2 spacecraft at Cape Canaveral pic.twitter.com/2626wb8596  NASA is in the middle of developing its own crew capsule called Orion, which made its first successful test flight late in 2014. But that won’t resume testing until at least 2017, and crewed testing of Orion isn't expected for another five years after that. In the meantime, NASA still relies on Roscosmos, the Russian space agency, to bring its astronauts into orbit. Political tensions and sheer cost — Roscosmos charges NASA about $70 million per astronaut per launch — are why NASA wants to use SpaceX and Boeing to bring astronauts to the ISS instead. To do that safely, however, the agency has laid out a roadmap that requires these private space companies to test certain aspects of their systems before crewed tests can be attempted. If SpaceX is successful with today's milestone attempt, the company will unlock about $30 million of the money NASA has budgeted for the contract. A failure would mean the company faces a tighter schedule going forward.

It’s a journey that will take him across the most featureless, unforgiving expanse of saltwater on Earth. This is no sailboat, though: he’ll be 5 miles above the planet in a freezing, cramped capsule, without enough oxygen to even stay conscious. Solar Impulse 2 is one of the most ambitious aircraft ever built, because it’s powered by sunlight alone; there’s not a drop of gasoline spinning its four propeller engines. It’s a sprawling mass of carbon fiber and silicon with a wingspan 11 and a half feet longer than a Boeing 747-8 jumbo jet. It is legitimately enormous, projecting the unwieldy awkwardness of a growth-spurting teenager whose limbs aren’t quite the right size for their body. (It also looks a bit like a UFO when it’s airborne.) Accomplished endurance pilots André Borschberg and Bertrand Piccard are currently flying it around the world in 12 segments in a bid to raise global awareness about renewable energy.     That’s where this unprecedented flight from Nanjing, China to Hawaii comes into play — a flight that’s expected to last 120 hours, or five full days. If it’s successful, it would shatter the record for the duration of a solo aircraft flight: 67 hours and one minute, set by the late adventurer Steve Fossett in his Virgin Atlantic GlobalFlyer while circumnavigating the globe. The Solar Impulse 2 is much, much slower, which is why they will likely break the duration record over a much shorter distance. ""The plane itself flies between 25 and 30 knots, which is quite slow,"" Piccard says. ""And you have to add the speed of the wind. When I went to China, I started to fly backward, which is quite strange in an airplane."" To put that in perspective, a Boeing 737 cruises at over 440 knots. The Nanjing-to-Hawaii leg will be piloted by Borschberg, while Piccard monitors the aircraft and encourages him via satellite phone from mission control in Switzerland. ""We are supporting each other with our personal experience,"" says Piccard, who is scheduled to fly the aircraft’s subsequent leg from Hawaii to Arizona. ""So when I fly, he can give me some advice, support me, and so on, and that will be the case when I fly to Phoenix."" But with or without verbal encouragement, how does a single human being physically pilot an aircraft for that long? It’s not a simple matter of taking off, switching on the autopilot, and reading a book, as might be the case with an advanced airliner. ""Sleeping, we don’t exceed 20 minutes at a time because we can’t let the aircraft go longer without really taking care of it,"" says Borschberg. The plane’s gigantic wingspan and light weight make it far more subject to the whims of the atmosphere than a typical aircraft, and its autopilot system only works in reasonably calm conditions. Piccard notes that it’s not uncommon in turbulence for the pilot to need to take the ailerons, the devices on the wings that allow the aircraft to bank and turn, all the way to their limits until the pilot’s control stick won’t go any further.     Sleeping in 20-minute spurts sounds unpleasant, but there’s precedent for it: polyphasic sleep is the fairly well-established practice of disregarding the body’s natural desire to sleep once per day, and some have managed to keep it up for years on end. Borschberg will augment that meager sleep schedule with a regimen of stretching and yoga poses in his cramped cabin to stay alive, awake, and alert. ""In between [naps], we use all the techniques… yoga and meditation, and I’ve adapted these to the conditions of the airplane. So I will use these breathing techniques that you get from yoga to stimulate the mind, to keep the right mindset, to stimulate the body,"" he tells me. There’s no room to stand up, but the pilots can change positions, sit up, and lay down. He notes that I’m probably suffering the same fate in my line of work. ""If you work eight hours in front of a computer, you are in terrible shape. It’s the same here — if you fly all the time, you end up in terrible shape, so we need to find ways to get rid of these strains that you have on the body."" Furthermore, flying the Solar Impulse 2 long distances requires a daily routine that involves climbing to 28,000 feet in the morning to capture sunlight and descending to just 3,000 feet at night to conserve energy. There’s not much margin for error in keeping the batteries charged enough for flight, either. ""When you fly east, you have shorter nights. This is important for us, because if the night is too long, we don’t have enough energy storage for the entire night,"" Piccard says. It’s not just staying comfortable, awake, and fully charged that Borschberg needs to worry about, though. At Solar Impulse 2’s peak altitudes, the human body needs supplemental oxygen to survive, and the aircraft isn’t pressurized like an airliner cabin would be. That means oxygen masks, yet another complexity and inconvenience that the pilots must endure. What’s more, the deep-freeze temperatures at 28,000 feet require layered clothing in the unheated cockpit. (Pressurization and heating are energy-sapping luxuries that a solar aircraft simply can’t afford.)     There’s also a host of very practical matters to consider. ""We have a toilet on board, so we really try to have a sustainable life. I try to eat normally, I go to the toilet normally,"" Borschberg says. I asked if they were able to steal a lot of techniques from spaceflight, but not really: Solar Impulse has the benefit of gravity. That’s a game-changer for going to the bathroom. Should something go terribly wrong over the course of the five-day slog, Borschberg is equipped with a parachute and can bail out. Both pilots trained with naval teams to learn survival techniques. In the open waters of the Pacific, that kind of training could easily mean the difference between life and death. Of course, everyone is hoping for a smooth, uneventful flight, peppered with 20-minute naps and satellite phone chats with friends and support staff back in Switzerland. After arriving in Hawaii, Borschberg and Piccard will prepare for five more legs, finally arriving back in Abu Dhabi where the round-the-world trip first began in early March. The timeline is flexible, depending on when the team can get the calm, sunny weather that the aircraft needs. It’s a tremendous undertaking with no immediate impact on the aviation industry — giant, one-person airplanes that fly 30 miles per hour aren’t particularly practical — but Piccard says his goals are much bigger than the Solar Impulse 2’s giant, solar cell-cloaked wings. ""It’s really to show what we can do with renewable energies, and with key technologies that can save energy. This is really the vision I had in the beginning, to do something extremely difficult, something that people would consider impossible.""",0.6856781229941402,0.3143218770058598,0.8112274891831835,1205,4.8871369294605813,640,6.1203124999999998,0,12,"Transportation, Report"

Pet owners with multiple cats will recognize this scenario: you put food out for all your furry friends, and that one greedy tabby cheerfully trots up to gobble — and subsequently throw up — whatever its siblings' dishes contain. But a new Indiegogo campaign launched today by a Taiwanese company called 42ARK might have a high-tech solution for your feline feeding problems: a cat-feeding device that uses facial recognition technology to dispense a predetermined amount of kibble to the appropriate cat. ""If a human can recognize the facial differences [that distinguish one cat from another], than the machine can do it too,"" says 42ARK co-founder Mu-Chi Sung. ""And the platform that the cat sits on is actually a scale, so it can recognize cats by weight"" as well. facial recognition technology in a kibble dispenser Sung first came up with the idea for this kibble dispenser — called the Bistro smart cat feeder — after experiencing a scare with one of his pets, Momo. The white feline developed pancreatitis and subsequently stopped feeding, but Sung's other pets were eating her food, so he didn't notice right away. ""I have been raising so many cats and some passed away, but usually we didn't notice that they were sick,"" Sung explains. ""I should have noticed earlier, because it's often too late when they show serious symptoms."" Momo's brief but serious illness is what prompted Sung to think about integrating facial recognition technology in a kibble dispenser. But the Bistro smart cat feeder doesn't just hand out food to a specific animal: it also knows when to stop. By monitoring how much your cat has eaten and had to drink during each feeding session, the company says that the feeder can determine when your feline has had enough — or when it hasn't eaten at all. And users can set the food dispenser to only hand out small quantities of kibble at a time, so cats that tend to eat quickly and throw up are forced to pace themselves. quantifying your cat to avert throw-up Moreover, the device records your cat's feeding and weight information in the accompanying free Bistro app, which graphs your pet's food intake over time. ""I wanted to have a device to monitor their appetite and their weight changes"" Sung says, ""because these are early symptoms [of illness].""    And especially involved cat owners will be happy to learn that the camera that recognizes their cat can also be used to live stream their feeding sessions. All a user has to do is set up the Bistro app to notify them when an animal is feeding — thus allowing cat-lovers to watch their pets eat while at work, or on the go. ""It's also a social network,"" Sung explains. ""You can use this device to establish your cat's profile."" When you take a picture of your cat, you can post it to the profile, and your cat's feeding history can be posted as well, Sung says. ""It's basically a live stream of your cats' everyday moments."" ""It's basically a live stream of your cats' everyday moments."" The feeder isn't perfect though, because it won't prevent multiple cats from sticking their heads in there at once. To counter this, 42ARK suggests that users try different strategies like adjusting food quantities to ensure that nothing is left on the tray once a cat has finished eating, or by spacing out feeding times. And eventually, the founders say they will ""open up fully programmable feeder APIs for people / hackers to create new sharable feeding strategy to control [a cat's] daily intake"" using the Bistro app. For now, 42ARK has chosen to market the Bistro feeder solely as a cat-specific kibble dispenser because of the device's size. But Sung says that it might also work for small dogs, despite the fact that it's not optimized for canines. Early-bird Indiegogo backers can get a Bistro for $149 USD, but quantities are limited. The official Indiegogo price for the Bistro is $179. And once it hits the market, Sung expects that the price will rise to $249, so retailers can turn a profit. If the project is a success, 42ARK plans to ship the Bistros to backers by February 2015. As for Momo, Sung says she's doing well now. She lost two legs because of her illness, but ""she plays with the laser pointer every day."" And for $50, you might actually get to see her do this, since one of the Indiegogo rewards involves a video-chat session with Momo and the 42ARK founders.",0.4736555204395466,0.5263444795604534,0.8642871725085269,800,4.7324999999999999,408,5.6764705882352944,0,0,"Design, Tech"

""What makes Airbnb unique is its people, our hosts, and our guests"" The site looks great, but what's perhaps more important is Airbnb's new focus on ""belonging,"" a theme the company touts frequently on its new site and with its new logo. ""What makes Airbnb unique is its people, our hosts, and our guests, so we wanted to create a symbol of belonging,"" says Justin Santamaria, who led the project. Airbnb seems to be hoping that the sense of belonging its users and hosts cultivate is what distinguishes the company from competitors, where booking a room is arguably more transactional and less neighborly. Airbnb's new logo, called ""The Bélo,"" was crafted accordingly, and is a combination of a person's face, a place pin, and a heart. The logo is certainly cute, but has drawn early criticism for its uncanny likeness to the logo of Automation Anywhere, and also to some less savory body parts. Airbnb's old listing page Airbnb's new listing page The company's focus on belonging also manifests itself in some new features. A useful new section at the bottom of every listing shows nearby restaurants, bars, and points of interest that hosts have highlighted. ""You can not just get a sense of of listing, but also how you'd belong in the neighborhood you're staying in,"" says Santamaria. A neat grid of interesting places surround each listing's location pin, almost like a hyper-specific Foursquare. Airbnb is also offering a new ""Create"" page that lets you customize its new Bélo logo with hundreds of stickers, colors, and textures so you can display one on your front door, or on a T-shirt or mug. ""Create Airbnb is a recognition that our identity simply cannot be separated from all of you,"" writes CEO Brian Chesky in a blog post. ""This is a shared brand identity. It's something no company has ever done before."" The big idea, writes Chesky, is to make Airbnb guests feel at home in any of the 34,000 cities and 190 countries where the company has rooms. Most hotel chains have brands that span the width of the world — brands that customers might stay local to for years or even decades.

At a press conference in New York City this afternoon, Jay Z and a huge group of musical stars took the stage to officially relaunch TIDAL, the streaming music service he recently acquired as part of a $56 million deal. The rallying cry was a service that would ""turn the tide"" and restore the value to music by launching a service owned by artists. Coldplay, Rihanna, Daft Punk, Alicia Keys, Calvin Harris, Jack White, Madonna, Usher, Arcade Fire, Deadmau5, and Beyoncé joined Jay Z in the owners circle. He is reportedly offering millions of dollars and  an equity stake to artists who join him.  Turn the tide against what exactly? The unspoken enemies are services like Spotify that offer streaming music for free, supported by advertising. Many artists have accused it of paying only a pittance for the rights to stream their music. TIDAL, by contrast, has promised to pay double the standard streaming royalties, a promise it confirmed with The Verge this afternoon. It's framing itself as a sort of United Artists for the streaming era, a business built in opposition to tech companies that traffic in ads. That sounds like a huge difference, but of course there are some caveats. Before today, that premium tier was the only one TIDAL offered. This morning it introduced a $9.99 service with standard definition audio, which will pay just the standard royalty rates. The double royalties only get paid on streams for customers who sign up for the $19.99 plan, which promises higher quality audio files, but is twice the cost of a typical Spotify subscription. In other words TIDAL is bound by the same economics as its competitors, but it choose to move up the food chain, away from the free ad-supported tier that pay the least per stream. The larger argument is over what will be a better business in the long run. Spotify has always argued that offering a free tier helps to build the biggest audience, and that over time more of those people will switch to the paid version. It has gotten to more than 60 million customers this way, 15 million of whom pay. Tidal, by contrast, has only around 17,000 paying subscribers. It's easy to understand artists' frustration and skepticism. The US music industry generates roughly half the annual revenue it did back in 1999. And while there are tens of millions of people listening to Spotify, the revenue from ad supported streaming is smaller than that generated by sales of vinyl records. The simple truth remains, however, that streaming music is the industry's best bet for growth. Artists seem to grasp that, but want to make sure that it's paid streaming, where the economics are better for them. That business now generates more money than CDs. The battle over how best to build the music business — and best for whom — is going to get very heated over the next year. Taylor Swift's departure from Spotify was a big moment, and TIDAL's move to capture exclusives and better reward artists is another. And behind most of these artists are record labels who often negotiate the deals with streaming services and write the checks for the artists only after taking their cut. Where those power players fit into this new ""artist owned"" service isn't clear, but they often have control over where an artist's music can appear. In an interview with Billboard, Jay Z acknowledged that many label executives were suspicious of what he was attempting to do with TIDAL. The elephant in the room is Apple, which has plans to relaunch both its Beats streaming service and to integrate it with the iTunes music store. Apple reportedly also plans to eliminate the option of a free tier. If there is any company on earth that can afford to pay a premium to woo artists and win exclusives, it would be the world's richest and most profitable corporation.

They don’t have what has become a crucial service for participation in modern society: internet service at home. The proportion of households with internet service had been rising steadily for decades, according to the Pew Research Center, until the past few years when the adoption rate slowed. One reason? The high cost of broadband, and the lack of competition that leads to those high prices. This story was published by  The Center for Public Integrity, a nonprofit, nonpartisan investigative news organization in Washington, DC. A Center for Public Integrity analysis of internet prices in five US cities and five comparable French cities found that prices in the US were as much as 3.5 times higher than those in France for similar service. The analysis shows that consumers in France have a choice between a far greater number of providers — seven on average — than those in the US, where most residents can get service from no more than two companies. The Center’s analysis echoes the findings of several studies on internet pricing disparities worldwide. By mapping the service areas of US providers,  The Center for Public Integrity also found that telecommunications companies appear to carve up territory to avoid competing with more than one other provider. Higher broadband prices don’t just mean fewer dollars in Americans’ wallets at the end of every month. They make it difficult for low- to middle-income families to afford fast internet service, which has become a necessity for job training, education, health care. According to data in a report by the US National Technology and Information Administration, more than 8 percent of US households say they cannot afford broadband. President Barack Obama this year called for faster, more affordable internet service for everyone. ""Just like we today expect clean running water, sewage and electricity as essential, so is broadband necessary to partake in society, to interact with government, to learn, to inform and be informed, to be a fully functioning member of society,"" said Rudolf van der Berg, a telecommunications and broadband policy analyst who studies policy at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Many studies have been conducted looking at price and competition. The Center’s research isn’t as comprehensive. Rather, it’s a snapshot meant to show the state of broadband for some American cities. The high prices and lack of competition in towns like these — and there are many — add to a growing divide between the connected and unconnected. And for the unconnected, the increasing gap will be measured in fewer economic opportunities, less access to healthcare, and other inequities.   When it comes to shopping for internet service, most Americans don’t have much of a choice. Consider the Seattle, Washington, metropolitan area, which includes Bellevue, Tacoma, and Redmond. The area boasts three providers who offer residents internet service of more than 10 megabits per second: Comcast, CenturyLink and Frontier Communications. But no Seattle resident has a choice of all three. While Comcast serves 95 percent of the Seattle metro area, CenturyLink only offers service in a territory south of the city, to about 31 percent of the area’s residents, according to data compiled by the Federal Communications Commission and mapped by the Center for Public Integrity. Frontier Communications serves residents north of the city, and covers just 29 percent of the metro area. The two companies’ service areas rarely overlap. That leaves the vast majority of residents in the metropolitan area that's home to tech giant Microsoft Corp. with a choice of just two internet providers. Coverage areas in other US cities the Center mapped are similar. Most residents have to choose between one company that offers internet via cable and another via DSL, or a fast telephone line. In the five French cities that the Center studied, residents have a choice of at least six providers for high-speed internet access. This is made possible by a regulatory requirement called open access, which allows companies to share networks for a fee, said Roslyn Layton, a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute who studies broadband at Aalborg University in Copenhagen. The US internet system, where territory appears to be deliberately carved up to minimize competition, grew from the telephone and cable television system that was already in place. Most internet providers — including CenturyLink, Frontier, and AT&T — started out as, or bought, phone companies, giving them control of one of the only physical lines that serve each household. The second choice comes from the cable TV providers who in turn own the cables that enter almost every home. Wireless and satellite companies try to compete but those technologies still can’t reliably provide high speeds, and often cap the amount of data consumers can use. Some researchers argue that lower population density in the United States leads to higher prices. But van der Berg doesn’t see it that way. ""Population density is an important factor in the cost of broadband, when you compare Hong Kong to Sweden or the USA,"" van der Berg said in an email. ""However just as decisive is the amount of competition or the lack of it."" A choice of just two, even three, providers isn’t enough to create a competitive market that will keep a check on prices, said Nicholas Economides, an economics professor at New York University who studies telecommunications. ""The only competition that remains is between telephone internet service providers and cable internet service providers — if you have it,"" Economides said. ""That’s the real problem, and that’s why we don’t have enough competition and higher prices.""    If you live in Columbus, Ohio, and you want fast internet service, you have two choices: Time Warner Cable’s $70-per-month plan or AT&T’s $61-per-month package, after any discount expires. If you live in Nice, France, it’s a different story. You can choose service from six internet providers, and you’ll pay between $19 and $40 a month for a comparable, or even faster, service. Columbus and Nice aren’t atypical, according to the analysis by The Center for Public Integrity. US broadband providers charge more for high-speed internet connections in four other US cities when compared with cities in France that had similar population densities, the Center found. In some cases, prices in the French cities are nearly half those in the US for speeds that are up to 10 times faster. (Read an explanation of the center’s methodology.) American internet companies argue that they provide better service and that’s why they charge more. Most of the connections in the French cities the Center studied were sent over copper wires rather than cable or fiber. Unlike cable, which 96 percent of Americans have access to, speeds slow over copper the farther a customer is from the central office where the signal originates. DSL — as copper connections are called — is the primary reason European internet providers deliver just 74 percent of their advertised speeds, according to the European Commission. US providers give their users the speeds that they advertise, the Federal Communications Commission reported. ""Europeans pay less because they get less,"" Layton said in an email. Layton says competition in Europe depresses revenue and discourages investment in faster and better service. ""Americans may pay more, but we get more."" But even accounting for the slower speeds, internet packages in France are still a better deal. For example, in Nice, French provider OVh Telecom offers the most expensive service, at $35.28 per month for 19 megabits per second, or $1.86 per megabit. Reducing the speeds by the 74 percent of what European telecoms truly deliver increases the cost per megabit to $2.50. That’s still 28 percent less than the $3.50 per megabit Time Warner Cable charges for nearly the same speed, and 26 percent less than what AT&T charges. In all but two instances, all internet packages in the five French cities were a greater value. The findings ""are not surprising, unfortunately,"" said Danielle Kehl, a policy analyst at the Open Technology Institute in Washington, D.C., and one of the authors of a study that also found US broadband prices are higher than those in most other foreign cities. Other studies have come to similar conclusions. The US has the ninth most expensive broadband service among the 34 OECD countries, which are among the largest economies in the world. The comparison looked at 15 megabit-per-second downloads, a speed fast enough to conduct most of today’s routine internet applications with two devices running at the same time. The conservative American Enterprise Institute and a professor at the University of Pennsylvania Law School who supports fewer regulations for the telecom industry, have each concluded that US prices for broadband are higher than European countries for faster speeds, but lower for slower service. Internet providers in the five US cities studied defended their higher prices. Verizon Communications said its prices are ""very competitive"" and offer ""great value."" An AT&T official didn’t answer a question asking why their prices were higher, but referred the center — ""in an attempt to broaden your perspective,"" according to an email — to two studies that actually concluded US internet providers charge higher prices for faster connections than providers in the European Union. CenturyLink said in an email that it ""seriously questions whether these are appropriate comparisons to make"" because of differences in population densities, the kinds of services providers offer and different regulations that affect the operations of US and European companies. Time Warner Cable said in an email that comparing prices of stand-alone internet systems ""doesn’t reflect typical consumer behavior in the US and could well skew any price comparison to a different marketplace"" because the majority of their customers bundle internet with cable television. Cox Communications and Frontier Communications did not respond to questions.    The higher price Americans pay for fast internet leads many lower-income people to forego the service. The percentage of Americans with a home internet connection has steadily risen since 2000, leveling off over the past few years at 73 percent of all households in 2013, according to the latest figures from the Pew Research Center. A 2012 survey on internet use in Illinois conducted by John Horrigan, who studied internet adoption when working on the Obama administration’s 2010 National Broadband Plan, found that 29 percent of those who didn’t have internet service in their homes said the high cost, including the price of a computer, was the reason. The study showed a stronger link between price and adoption than previous and later studies, which didn’t specifically ask consumers if price affected their decision on whether to connect.  In a 2013 survey conducted by the US Economics and Statistics Administration, nearly half of those without a home connection said the internet was not relevant to their lives or they weren’t interested. Only 28 percent cited high costs as the reason for not buying an internet connection. Those findings have led some researchers such as Richard Bennett, a visiting fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, to argue that policies to teach computer skills are more important to increasing internet use than focusing on lowering prices or providing subsidies. Higher prices do have a secondary effect, he said. Horrigan, however, argues the earlier studies are flawed because of the way the questions were asked. In past surveys, those who said they didn’t have an in-home internet connection were asked to provide reasons why. Interviewers didn’t offer any reasons. Responses were then grouped into categories, with the most popular answer being the internet isn’t relevant. When surveyors offered specific reasons, including cost, that factor rose to the top. ""Based on years of studying this, I am convinced that price is clearly the main reason"" Americans don’t connect to the internet, Horrigan said. ""If you solve the price problem alone, we’re still going to have people not choosing to take the service. But you have to start with price.""

The ride-sharing company will pay the government fees for its drivers in the country to obtain commercial driver's licenses, according to a report in German business magazine Wirtschafts Woche. Uber's German chief, Fabien Nestmann, was quoted saying that the company will pay the €100 to €200 cost for a license. He added, ""We will also pay the €150 to €200 it would cost our partners to have the Chamber of Commerce license them as taxi companies."" The news comes just over a week after a Frankfurt district court banned the company's low-cost Uberpop service across the country. The court ruled that, per German law, Uber's drivers were required to obtain commercial licenses. In Nestmann's comments to Wirtschafts Woche, the executive explained that Uber would start a new low-cost service in Germany this summer, likely called Uber X, that would comply with the commercial license regulations. Uber has fought hard to avoid costly commercial licenses Uber has long maintained that drivers for its low-cost programs like Uber X and Uberpop don't require commercial licenses. These drivers typically use their own vehicles, unlike drivers in the standard Uber (or ""Uber Black"") service, who are professionals connected with taxi firms and commission-approved vehicles. Commercial licenses can be costly and difficult to obtain, and since Uber X drivers don't work for licensed taxi operators on the side, in regions like Germany they can also be required to register themselves as a private taxi company. Such companies have a whole host of complications, like expensive insurance obligations and complex regulations — that's why Uber has always called itself a technology company, not a taxi operation. In the past Uber has seen government efforts to mandate commercial licenses as a threat to its popular Uber X services. Earlier this year, both Uber and competitor Lyft vehemently opposed a California DMV ruling that mandated commercial plates. The DMV's decision was then quickly reversed. Meanwhile, just a few days ago, Uber's offices in Paris were raided by police following a ruling that its Uberpop service was illegal because its drivers didn't hold chauffeur licenses. In Germany, Uber has vowed to appeal the commercial license ruling that resulted in the ban, but today's report suggests the company is ready to swallow the license fees if it must in order to keep its low-cost service on the roads in Germany.

Or you go to reach under your sink to grab another roll of toilet paper only to discover you've forgotten to order more. And maybe you eat nothing but mac and cheese, and did not correctly calculate your stockpile, so that you’re stuck actually having to cook real food one night.  This is not the sad, black-and-white world of late-night infomercials, but real life, Amazon says. The company is rolling out new hardware today called the Dash button that promises to solve these scenarios. It’s a small physical button that you can stick wherever, and press when you want to order more of something. Need more diapers? Hit the diaper button. Need more toilet paper? Just hit the toilet paper button. Find yourself running low on mac and cheese, razor blades, Gatorade, or laundry detergent? There is now a button for each one of those things. The future where you can just be lazy and spend money with a push of a button from Amazon is here, and it’s very real.  The Dash button is not to be confused with a separate piece of food-ordering hardware called Dash, which scans product barcodes and lets people speak orders into Amazon Fresh. Instead, it’s a much smaller Wi-Fi-enabled button that will instantly order a predetermined product within seconds of pressing it. Amazon already has your credit card information on file, and knows what size and quantity you want, so two days later, that product shows up at your house. A little multi-colored LED on the front of it will blink after you press it, then turn green to let you know it worked. Dash buttons can be stuck just about anywhere with an adhesive strip that’s on the back, though they are not magnetic. Amazon also gives you a small bumper that can go around it and allow it to be hung up on hooks or on strings. Some smarts have been included in its programming, so that if you or someone else hits the button more than once, it won't reorder until that same product has been delivered to your house. You can also turn this feature off — at your own peril — in Amazon’s mobile phone app. Amazon is launching the Dash buttons with 18 different partners today, and they’re free if you’re a Prime Member. You don’t get to use it on just any product on Amazon.com though. Each button is tied to a brand, or to be more specific, a product from a brand. You can, for instance, get a button for diapers, but it’s only for Huggies. If you’re a Pampers person, you’ll still have to order the old-fashioned way. But it might not be that way forever. Along with buttons, Amazon is launching what it calls the Dash Replenishment Service, which is ultimately designed to do away with the buttons entirely. Companies that make products can bake this technology into their own hardware: things like coffeemakers, washer/dryers, printers, and pet food dispensers. It’s not so great for household goods like paper towels, but Amazon is betting that eventually these sensors will get so small and cheap to make, that you could have them in individual products too. In the meantime, a few of the first products to embed the replenishment service are ones that are not leaving your house. New York-based Quirky has designed a pour-over coffee maker (see the image to the right) that keeps track of both its bean reservoir and your filter supply. Get too low on beans, and you can have it set to automatically reorder for you. Coffee aficionados might scoff at that, but that system could be ideal in offices. Similarly, Quirky has come up with both pet food and baby formula dispensers that keep track of how much supply you have left and will reorder when it notices you’re low. These same ideas are being implemented in washers from Whirlpool, printers from Brother, and filtered water pitchers from Brita. Amazon’s new platform will also let other companies create similar types of products. It’s not supplying the sensors, but it is providing what it says is a very simple back end through Amazon Web Services that does the heavy lifting of taking the order, processing the payment, and fulfilling it. Amazon won’t say what the business arrangement is between it and companies that want to get in on this, though it’s clear that its pitch is repeated business from Amazon customers who might end up keeping these buttons and integrated devices in their homes for years to come. There are a few obvious gaps and shortcomings where Dash buttons are less than ideal, especially where the Dash replenishment system has been integrated into hardware. The coffeemaker is a good example. Coffee enthusiasts like to keep their beans as fresh as possible, and will often change the roast they’re buying between bags. They also buy from a variety of sources, making the Dash implementation less useful there. Another issue is that the size, price, and availability of Prime-eligible products can frequently change on Amazon. Sometimes that means a multi-pack of something can become markedly cheaper, or make the product you buy considerably more expensive. Longtime users of Amazon’s ""subscribe and save"" service also tend to get better deals on recurring purchases on the very same types of products where Dash buttons would make the most sense, but Dash isn’t able to optimize for price changes, at least not right now. Amazon is keen to note that you have some time after orders have been made to make adjustments, and that Dash button purchases can be more sporadic than ones made with its subscribe and save service. Amazon has been testing Dash buttons in hundreds of homes for the past year, about how long its Dash scanner hardware for Amazon Fresh has existed. The key difference is that this is open to a potentially much larger group than the food delivery service, which currently runs $299 a year and exists only in Seattle, parts of California, and New York. It also removes an entire step in the process by letting you buy things instantly, whereas Dash requires you to log into Amazon from your phone or computer to verify and order. That ease of spending money may be scary to some, but Amazon is betting that, for the types of people who buy the same things over and over again, this is exactly what they want. Taking a step back, Amazon Dash buttons and the service that powers them are perhaps the clearest example of where human ingenuity intersects with laziness. We used to have to hunt and kill our food, or at least walk to the store and buy it. Now we just need to fumble for a button in the dark.",0.5979762769986676,0.4020237230013324,0.4917679929992768,1159,4.7368421052631575,561,5.9554367201426022,0,6,"Business, Tech"

""We have 85 million Amazon customers who have shopped for products this past year that often require a service afterwards,"" said Peter Faricy, vice president for Amazon Marketplace. ""Things like TVs, toilets, and sinks."" Today, the company is launching a new section in the US, Home Services, where customers can shop for professional help. It's launching with 700 different services, from the ordinary to the esoteric, everything from installing a garbage disposal to renting you a goat herd that will graze away the unwanted vegetation on your property. 85 million potential customers a year A big part of the sales pitch from Amazon is that they are doing the hard work of figuring out who you can trust. ""We’re very excited to see if we can solve what today is a real pain point. It’s tough to quickly find someone who is qualified,"" says Faricy. Amazon says it accepts an average of three out of every 100 service professionals in each metro area. It makes sure each business is licensed, insured, and passes a five-point background check, with a further six-point background check for each technician. You will never need to worry about hiring a sub-par goat grazer again. The second half of Amazon's promise is speed and transparency. The marketing materials claim it takes 60 seconds to buy a service, regardless of whether that is deck repair, house cleaning, or hedge trimming. ""We really make something transparent for customers which is difficult today,"" says Faricy. ""We have standardized and prepackaged all of our service offerings. So you know exactly what is going to be done and how much it’s going to cost you, up front, no surprises."" Don't hire a sub par goat grazer That sounds nice, although it seems likely that many of these services won't be so easy to fit into just a few multiple choice questions. ""They’re shoehorning local services into the same way they treat other products,"" Thumbtack CEO Marco Zappacosta told Forbes.""But what about building a deck? Your deck is going to be different than my deck and your backyard is going to be different than my backyard.""   One thing that Home Services hopes to help customers avoid is the up-selling and haggling over price that can come with a lot of service work. Faricy says that all the billing will run through Amazon, and that the provider only gets paid after the finished job has been confirmed. During the beta test, there were reports of customers who had issues with a surprise charge on their bill, which Amazon eventually resolved after a lengthy back and forth. Amazon takes a cut of each service fee, and while they wouldn't share exactly what the split is, language from the beta version of the website shows Amazon taking 20 percent on standard services, 15 percent on custom, and 10 percent on recurring. Faricy says that the majority of the labor available on the market will be small, local providers, but Home Services is also integrating with startups like TaskRabbit as well as national chains like Pep Boys. Before today, Amazon was beta testing this offering in Seattle, New York, San Francisco, and Los Angeles. As of today, it will be available in 41 states, with the goal of providing strong coverage across the thirty biggest metro areas in the US. As for how big this business could be, Faricy points out that independent research shows consumers typically spend four times as much on services as physical goods, meaning a major new revenue stream for Amazon if Home Services is a success.

There are smaller spaces for private work as well, and employees can always head to the 9-acre park located on MPK20's roof, boasting a half-mile walking trail, over 400 trees, and areas to work in. There's also a conference room slash ball pit inside — although this was apparently just the temporary result of ""first day shenanigans.""  First day shenanigans #theaquarium A photo posted by Wei Jien (@wei.jien) on Mar 30, 2015 at 6:48pm PDT ""The building itself is pretty simple and isn’t fancy,"" wrote Zuckerberg on his Facebook page. ""That’s on purpose. We want our space to feel like a work in progress. When you enter our buildings, we want you to feel how much left there is to be done in our mission to connect the world."" ""unassuming, matter-of-fact and cost effective."" In an official statement regarding the project, Gehry said that Zuckerberg had wanted a space that was ""unassuming, matter-of-fact and cost effective."" The building, he said, was therefore not ""overly designed"" and has been kept ""flexible to respond to the ever-changing nature of [Zuckerberg's] business; one that facilitated collaboration and one that did not impose itself on their open and transparent culture. This is the building that we created for him."" These values — openness, lack of pretense — are also noticeable in how Facebook chose to publicize the site. Rather than releasing a bunch of official photographs to the press, the company invited its top Instagrammers to document the site before it opened up. Will Google have to beat this by organizing a Periscope party to look round their new, planned offices? Somehow, we doubt it. Yesterday, some other Instagrammers and I had the opportunity to visit @facebook HQ and take a first look at their new building: #MPK20. It's a huge, open floor plan space designed by Frank Gehry. It looks like a fun place to work, and it opens today! Fun fact: FB worked with 15 artists on the new artwork in the building. Every piece was created onsite and is meant to speak abstractly to what FB does—many of the pieces are a nod to connections, community, networks and systems. This particular hallway makes me want an orange dessert. More photos to come. #MPK20firstlook A photo posted by David E.

Previous documents have shown the NSA and GCHQ collecting data from undersea data cables, but this is the most comprehensive look at how the NSA uses that data to zero in on specific activities or actors on the web. According to the new documents, the scanning is enabled by broad legal powers, granted by the Department of Justice and FISA court in 2012. An initial Justice Department order (interpreting Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act) authorized the NSA to target data based on specific IP addresses or threat signatures that were linked to foreign nations. In addition to its surveillance operations, the NSA is tasked with defending official US networks from digital intrusions, a task that's grown increasingly difficult as states like China have grown more sophisticated. But according to the documents, limiting the scans to foreign states was too restrictive for the NSA. Over the course of 2012, NSA director Keith Alexander lobbied the Justice Department to extend the signature-based scans to malware that hadn't been linked to state actors, but his efforts were unsuccessful. Still, the agency  Specific malware programs are often reused, even between criminals and governments, so it's notoriously difficult for researchers to connect a tactic to a specific actor. Experts are comparing the resulting system to the network intrusion detection systems (or NIDS) that are deployed on many private networks. Given a top-down view of the network, NIDS systems monitor for malware traveling between points on the network, rather than catching the bad actors as they infect individual machines. Those systems have also been proposed at a national level, although they've rarely been deployed publicly due to the privacy issues involved. 6/4 4:07PM ET: An earlier version of this article stated that the Justice Department had authorized the NSA to collect signatures not linked to foreign actors.

Michael Fassbender. Ryan Gosling. Those are just a few of the actors that had been attached (or rumored) to star in the big-screen adaptation of the 1960s spy series The Man From UNCLE. It’s a varied but intriguing group, all from when Steven Soderbergh was set to direct the film as one of his last hurrah victory laps before he swore off movies altogether. But attachments are only as good as the trade magazine paper they’re announced on, and in 2011 Soderbergh ended up leaving the project over budget and casting issues.  And here we are, four years later, presented with the final product from Snatch and Sherlock Holmes director Guy Ritchie. If you’ve seen one Ritchie flick you know his style: outrageous violence and outrageous humor, matched with whiz-bang transitions and an assured sense of visual polish. They’re upper-class (or just more British) versions of what your dad might call “guy movies” — hyper-macho tales of posturing criminals and thugs, sure, but rendered with an effervescent flair, and usually held together by an incredibly charismatic lead actor.  But what happens when Ritchie doesn’t have a Brad Pitt (Snatch), Jason Statham (Revolver), or Robert Downey Jr. (Sherlock Holmes)? Well, then you get something like UNCLE, starring Henry Cavill and Armie Hammer. It’s clear what kind of movie it wants to be: a tongue-in-cheek throwback to classic spy movies, anchored by the Odd Couple dynamic of its two leads. There’s just one problem: this star vehicle doesn’t have any stars. The time is 1963, and Cavill plays Napoleon Solo, a former criminal turned US superspy. He’s in East Berlin to rescue an auto mechanic named Gaby (Ex Machina’s Alicia Vikander), whose father is at the heart of a plot to enrich uranium and build nuclear weapons. While trying to get her over the wall, Solo is interrupted by Illya Kuryakin (Hammer, taking his best Boris Badenov accent for a spin), a Russian spy with the same mission. Eventually the two men are forced by their respective bosses to team up to find Gaby’s father. With neither trusting the other — and the wild card of Gaby’s affections in play — the requisite hijinks ensue. Don’t worry if you don’t know the TV show; judging from the film, I’m not sure Ritchie or his writing partner did either. But from a production standpoint, the film is beautiful: the costume design evokes the idealized ‘60s perfectly, and the photography is so lush I found myself lost in the hazy glow of Cavill and Hammer’s chiseled visages (I’m joking, but only partly). Ritchie’s films have always had an undeniable, kinetic energy to them, and while the vibe feels a little forced this time around — slapping music on and turning it up to 11 only works the first four times, thank you — there are nevertheless hints of a fun, engaging movie here. I couldn’t help but wonder what it would have been like if it was Clooney’s scowl and charm wrapped up in Solo’s suit, pulling the audience along with sheer charismatic will. Instead… AGENT: Henry Cavill ALIAS: Napoleon Solo, Kal-El, Man of Steel, Theseus, The Bechinned Wonder SKILLS: Devastatingly earnest brow, hulking shoulders, genetically perfected skin laminate WEAKNESSES: Relatability, accessibility, genetically perfected skin laminate Henry Cavill’s been a bit of a wildcard. He’s clearly somebody audiences are going to get used to, just from the slate of upcoming DC films alone. The problem there is that he’s playing Superman, a character that’s already pretty boring, in an iteration that adds dour and self-serious to the mix. UNCLE is the best I’ve ever seen him; he summons an ingenious, overwrought American accent and milks it for all it’s worth, and if you squint, the performance almost plays. But there’s still an unshakably inert blandness to his presence. There’s simply no danger when Cavill is on screen, no sense that anything’s at stake. It might make him the perfect kind of presence for a studio to bet on, but it’s not very fun to watch. AGENT: Armie Hammer ALIAS: Illya Kuryakin, The Lone Ranger, The Winklevii, The Bechinned Marvel SKILLS: Ocular intensity, affability, communally agreed-upon status as Next Big Thing™ WEAKNESSES: Accents, low threat level, impossibly good teeth Hammer is another leading-man-in-waiting that’s never quite popped the way many have expected him to. The confounding thing here is that we have empirical proof he can be fantastic: his dual turn as Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss in The Social Network was a minor masterpiece of smarm, but ever since he’s been stuck in roles that are vanilla to the extreme, whether its The Lone Ranger or Mirror Mirror. Hollywood seems set on turning him into a caricature of a leading man; all perfect blue eyes and dazzling smile. Kuryakin may have a temper problem, sure, but it’s fleeting at best, and I never believed the character was ever in danger of losing real control. Both Cavill and Hammer are different versions of the same problem, one Ritchie has never had to contend with in quite this way. Whether it’s Downey, Jude Law, Statham — hell, even Gerard Butler — the director has always worked best with actors that seem perched on the edge of instability. It lends a vitality to the proceedings that matches up perfectly with his own, nearly out-of-control sensibilities — but more importantly, it’s a quality almost all of the best stars — the most memorable, the most beloved — have had. In a time when the film industry is relying on the safe, consistent box office of the comic book movie more than ever before, things like personality and voice — whether on the part of writers, directors, or actors — are more vital than ever. Iron Man isn’t huge simply because of Marvel Comics; it’s huge because of the undeniable draw of Robert Downey, Jr. Of course, that’s not really the way the game is played, is it? Actors have to struggle out of the straightjacket of typecasting to maintain any kind of diversity in their work — even more so if they want to attain that status of full-fledged movie star — even though that’s the very thing that gives their careers longevity and depth. Brad Pitt is now looked upon as a stalwart, but it wasn’t his golden-boy turns in Troy and Meet Joe Black that made it possible; it was a perfect mix of conventional roles ping-ponged with the weird (12 Monkeys), the horrifying (Se7en), and the outright ill-advised (Fight Club). The Man From UNCLE likely won’t pull in the kind of box office numbers to warrant the trilogy it’s hoping to start, and I can’t really say that audiences will be missing out on a whole lot. Hopefully it will encourage both of these actors to take some risks (Cavill certainly can’t be hurting for a payday). I’d like to see Hammer in his Se7en, Cavill in his American Beauty. I’d like to see them get the chance to step outside the magazine cover roles they seem to be continually steered toward, and for their directors to stop worrying about turning them into movie stars, and to see what they can really do.

VEGA INTL. Night School is the first Neon Indian album since 2011's glitchy, stargazing Era Extraña, and it's set for release on October 16th. Palomo has mostly kept quiet in the four years between full-lengths. He released a remix EP featuring tracks from Era Extraña in 2013, and contributed a new song to one of Grand Theft Auto V's in-game radio stations that same year. When the bouncy, Balearic ""Annie"" came out earlier this year, Palomo was still working on its parent album. Neon Indian was part of chillwave's Holy Trinity Neon Indian first became popular around the turn of the '00s as one of the standard-bearers for chillwave, a subgenre invented by Panda Bear's Person Pitch and given its magical name by Carles' Hipster Runoff. It wasn't much more than a specific strain of electro-pop, but the songs all sounded like they'd been recovered from half-melted cassette tapes; they tended towards the druggy, groggy, and reflective, and nodded toward dance music without actually becoming danceable. Neon Indian, Washed Out, and Toro y Moi became chillwave's Holy Trinity, the three projects that defined its limits and had the most potential for enduring careers (potential that's since been fulfilled). Of those three, Palomo was the weirdest and the funniest, and he had the most interesting set of influences. He sampled Todd Rundgren for his first big single, and he  turned the lament ""should have taken acid with you"" into a midnight pool party jam. By the time Era Extraña was released, he was pulling from The Flaming Lips, M83, and shoegaze in equal measure. ""Slumlord"" is a worthy comeback, like David Bowie's ""Let's Dance"" spit through a Super Nintendo and played under a spinning disco ball. It's dangerous, funky, and catchy as hell. ""Most of what I've learned about human nature in my 20s has happened after dark,"" said Palomo in a press release. ""People are just kind of more honest then. More deliberate.

I can't promise you'll like this week's playlist better than President Obama's collections of summer jams, but we certainly manage to cover a lot of ground between the two of us. Stick with Barry if you like the oldies, and come hang with me if you want something fresh. There's a Spotify playlist at the end for your listening convenience, and feel free to share your own favorite cuts / compliments / complaints from this week in the comments. Let's go: Carly Rae Jepsen, ""Your Type"":   I wrote about ""Warm Blood"" in this space a few weeks ago, and I try to spread the wealth when it comes to featuring artists here, but ""Your Type"" is too good to deny. The juxtaposition of those thudding, midnight highway synths and Carly's vocals — heavy with emotion and genuinely heartbroken, like something out of a John Hughes movie — is irresistible. A sign this song is truly great: it's hard to imagine it in the hands of any other pop star working without being diminished. Emotion is going to be a monster. Chvrches, ""Never Ending Circles"":   Can I interest you in a second straight piece of gleaming synth-pop? Chvrches don't have an immense discography — their second full-length, Every Open Eye, is due out in September — but they've managed to put their stamp on a specific sound. Sharp synths that rise and shine like balloons dipped in glitter, precise digital rhythms, Lauren Mayberry's unassuming confidence: they're the building blocks of every song the band makes, and the combination isn't getting old anytime soon. This isn't the sound usually associated with musical comfort food, but Chvrches' consistency and competence are reassuring to me. (Shout out to our dearly departed Nathan Ingraham, who is surely listening to this on repeat and refusing to speak to anyone and preparing pins for my voodoo doll should I fail to include this song this week.) Destroyer, ""Times Square"":   This song is poking and prodding all of my rock music hot spots: a horn line out of David Bowie's Young Americans, the swoon and sweep of Bruce Springsteen at his most love-drunk, piano chords that are heftier than beef stew. Let's acknowledge the tremendous feat Dan Bejar accomplishes here: he makes Times Square — to him, ""Tahhms Skwehhhh"" — sound like the pinnacle of romance and mystery. I don't live in New York, but I know enough to state with confidence that Times Square is breathtaking for five seconds and terrible forever. This is the sound of those first five seconds set to saxophone and put on loop. HEALTH, ""FLESH WORLD (UK)"":   Here's one of my favorite things about the vague and possibly useless art of music criticism: if you're feeling up to it, you could describe three of the first four songs in this roundup as ""synth-pop,"" which is a bit like taking a pine tree, a tulip, and a carrot and lumping them all together under ""plants."" HEALTH's probably the pine tree in that analogy: dense, thorny, open to beauty but not preoccupied with it. Liz Lopatto wrote a lot about the aggressive, intense sensuality of HEALTH's music in her review last week, and you can hear that loud and clear on ""FLESH WORLD."" It turns the inevitability of death into an enabling, freeing force. Joanna Newsom, ""Sapokanikan"":   It's been a half-decade since Newsom's last album, the mammoth Have One on Me, but she hasn't lost a step. ""Sapokanikam"" is jaunty and curious, and it would've slotted in nicely alongside songs like ""Good Intentions Paving Company"" and ""In California."" Maybe that's why it feels so surprising: all of Newsom's other albums have represented major shifts from their predecessors. Ys swallowed the quirky, precocious charm of The Milk-Eyed Mender in a swirl of obtuse lyricism and Van Dyke Parks arrangement, and Have One on Me stripped out that album's frippery and dense narrative for plainspoken, piercing writing. Change is a constant for Newsom, but Have One on Me remains one of the best albums of this decade — if she wants to hang out here a while, I won't begrudge her that. Lana Del Rey, ""High by the Beach"":   I feel like I've spent my whole week thinking about Lana: her impending album, her friendship with Elon Musk, her beef with helicopters, her worrying lack of furniture. Honeymoon is coming out on September 18th, and I'm sure it'll be stuffed with songs like this: languid, smoky, the slightest bit strange. Mac DeMarco, ""Another One"":   Mac DeMarco is one of the most charming artists working, a Canadian vagabond with an easy, toothy grin and a knack for simple, sweet songwriting. Another One is his new mini-LP, arriving a little more than a year after his sterling Salad Days, and this is the title track. It's one of his most elegant, poignant songs yet, flipping the LP's joke of a title into a piece of despondent counsel. This one might just be a little too sad for Animal Crossing. Majical Cloudz, ""Silver Car Crash"":   Listening to Montreal duo Majical Cloudz means steeling yourself for uncomfortable intimacy, whether in the face or transcendent joy or soul-splitting sadness. ""Silver Car Crash,"" the first single from their upcoming Are You Alone?, offers a little bit of both. It's a song about loving someone so much you're content to face death alongside them. That's a beautiful sentiment, but it's also bleak enough to send you staring into space at your keyboard — and it's that exact balance that makes this band so unique and compelling. Neon Indian, ""Slumlord"":   I wrote about this one in brief this morning, and I haven't stopped listening to it since. I love its slow acceleration, its careful construction, its seedy familiarity. It sounds like places I haven't had a chance to visit yet, and some I'll never get to visit: a Tokyo arcade; a crowded, neon-lit 1982 dancefloor; the inside of a complicated and dusty keyboard.

The medium is saturated with post-apocalyptic scenarios, from the nuclear wasteland of Fallout to Left 4 Dead’s zombie-ravaged rural hellscape. No matter the cause of the catastrophe, though, these games tend to have a lot in common: violent, action-packed affairs where you can’t go far before someone, or something, tries to kill you. But Everybody’s Gone to the Rapture envisions a different kind of doomsday. What if everybody just suddenly disappeared? And instead of trying to save what was left of the world, you were just trying to find out where everyone went?  “I really liked the idea of, well, what would normal people be doing if the world ended,” says Dan Pinchbeck, creative director at Rapture studio The Chinese Room. “Is there a game in that, rather than the same old kid of heroics?” Rapture takes place in a small English village in the 1980s, and at the outset you — whoever it is you play as — find yourself all alone, not long after the rest of the townsfolk have mysteriously vanished. Like the studio’s previous games, including Dear Esther, Rapture is an experience that plays with your expectations of what a game is: all you really do is walk around, looking for clues and listening to flashback sequences. From this simple base you’re able to slowly piece together not only the events leading to the end of the world, but also the lives of the town’s inhabitants. It’s an example of environmental storytelling, something that’s unique to games, where the world creates much of the narrative itself. But the game could’ve ended up very different. The initial prototype for Rapture had the same apocalyptic theme, but also gave players a time limit: at the beginning of the game you would have 60 minutes, after which point the world would end and so would the game. The idea was that you would replay that hour multiple times, exploring different characters and storylines each time. The concept was scrapped pretty early on — Pinchbeck likens it to a book that stops halfway through and tells you that you didn’t read fast enough — but not before the studio had become attached to the characters and location. And that location is a distinctly British one. The quiet town of Yaughton, in the Shropshire countryside, feels like a postcard that you can explore in three dimensions. The homes are full of cozy chairs and floral wallpaper, surrounded by peaceful gardens, and just about everywhere you go you’ll see cups of tea waiting patiently on a table or counter. It’s absolutely beautiful, but also haunting; when you remove people, things take on a whole new look. The local playground is especially creepy, devoid of children. Setting the game during the ‘80s, a time before the internet and cellphones became widespread, was also important for creating the sense of isolation that’s so key to the game. The picturesque town is much larger than games like Dear Esther, and that was one of the goals from the outset. ""We wanted to push further than we had done with Esther,"" says Pinchbeck. ""We wanted to see where the next place to go with it was. And I was playing a lot of open world games — Skyrim, Red Dead Redemption — at the time, and was thinking, we tend to make these things work in corridors, but could we do this if we went into an open world and did something that was fully non-linear."" You can go pretty much wherever you want in Yaughton, save for areas blocked by fences and locked doors, and the story unfolds differently depending on where you go and when. But that open nature also means that the world has to serve two purposes: it not only conveys the story, it also helps guide you. Rapture doesn’t provide you any overt instructions, but instead uses various techniques to highlight places of interest. The most obvious are the ghostly wisps, tiny balls of shimmering light that will fly around, sometimes impatiently, showing you places to check out. You’ll also hear things — radio static, a beeping phone — that will make you want to investigate a particular location. The world design is also often much more subtle, guiding you in ways you might not notice, according to Pinchbeck. He says that the team labored over specific details — the angle of a driveway, whether you could see an open door from the road — as a way of suggesting to players where they might want to go next without actually telling them. Even the power lines that run alongside the road serve as unconscious guides. These aspects are necessary so that players don’t get lost or frustrated. ""We really didn’t want the player to feel like they were being forced down a series of pipes in the world,"" he says. ""But also, you’re trying to make sure they’re not just completely lost. That balance between giving people enough clues and not lecturing on how to play the game is really hard."" According to Pinchbeck, one of the main goals of the studio was to never pull you out of the experience, and that’s part of the reason there’s no mini-map or typical on-screen instructions. Even the menus are styled and laid out as if they were part of the world, framed like a 1980s disaster preparedness pamphlet. ""It’s one of those things where, if you can, why wouldn’t you?"" he says of the menu design. ""It’s just better."" Equally important to the experience is the music and audio. You never see the former inhabitants of Yaughton — they appear as human silhouettes made of light — but you do hear them, and, much like in a book, you create your own vision in your mind for what they might look like. The wonderful music, meanwhile, imbues the otherwise quiet countryside with a real sense that something important is happening. The swelling score grows surprisingly loud during key moments, and often lingers afterwards to keep those events stuck in your head. Jessica Curry, Rapture’s composer, is also the co-studio head at The Chinese Room and served as director on the game — perhaps explaining why the music feels so integral to the experience. Rapture is part of a growing trend of narrative-focused, first-person games, which was largely spearheaded by the success of Dear Esther. Curiously, many of these games tackle a similar theme of disappearance; Gone Home is about exploring an empty home, trying to discover what happened to the family who lived there, while its successor Tacoma is about investigating an abandoned space station. Pinchbeck says that these thematic similarities are partially due to technical constraints of making a game with lots of people in it  — character animation and AI are a lot to take on for a small studio — but also because these games are essentially an offshoot of the first-person shooter, a genre that tends to explore themes of isolation. ""Right back to Doom, you’re the last one left on the moonbase,"" he explains. ""To me it was always just a sidestep from a long, proud history of first-person shooters."" For a new, growing genre of games, the question is what other kinds of stories it can tell. ""The next interesting step is thinking, how do these games become social?"" Everybody’s Gone to the Rapture is out now on PlayStation 4.

The wireless headphones’ plush exterior feels soft in your hand and fits snugly over your ears. Then Parrot’s new automatic noise canceling software kicks in and the outside world is muted before you start listening to whatever music you prefer. But in the same way that a treacherously squashy sofa can trap the unwary, the Zik 3 can be difficult to get full control over. Can too much comfort be a bad thing? Like previous Zik headphones, the Zik 3s have a capacitive panel on the right earpiece that allows you to control your music by swiping backwards and forward to skip tracks, up and down to change the volume, and tapping to play and pause. But these are gestures that work best with smooth glass, and controlling the Ziks can be frustrating. Compared to the Beats Solo, for example, which has tangible controls built into the earpiece, swiping feels a little sloppy. It's understandable that Parrot wouldn’t want to interrupt the clean, flowing Philippe Starck-design of the Zik 3s by incorporating buttons, but the company has sacrificed functionality for looks somewhat.   Parrot's smartwatch app for Apple Watch and Android Wear lets you control your music and tweak audio settings. But, of course, the headphones do have other options for playback, including new apps for both the Apple Watch and Android Wear. Like Parrot’s smartphone and tablet apps, this software allows you impressive control over the audio you’re listening to. You can recreate various acoustics, from a concert hall to a jazz club, and precisely tune the audio with a five-band, full-parametric equalizer. Parrot provides a wealth of presets for this, but users can also set their own. The company boasts that the new Ziks are entirely wireless. Not only can you listen to music via Bluetooth connection (alternatively, you can use a headphone jack or USB port), but you can also charge them wirelessly too. The company’s new Qi wireless charger is a slim oval that you sit an earpiece on ""like a pillow for your headphones."" Parrot says that other Qi wireless chargers will work just as well, with the Zik 3s running for six to seven hours on full whack, or up to 18 hours if you’re listening to music quietly or  just using the noise cancellation feature. However, the Zik 3’s 830 mAh battery is also removable, meaning users can carry spares. Testing out the full capacity of this battery life — as well as the extent of Parrot's 30 decibel noise-canceling tech — will have to wait for a full review. It's clear, though, that Parrot is continuing to evolve the Zik range, which it says has sold more than 250,000 units in the last three years. The first Zik headphones (unveiled in 2012) were massive, arty cans, while their successors introduced the slimmed down style seen in the Zik 3s. Although Parrot's headphones may have a reputation as specialist hardware, this latest pair could break into the mainstream. Consumers have warmed to the idea of headphones as statement accessories in recent years, and Parrot’s design and build quality is outstanding. Of course, quality doesn’t come cheap, and although there’s no exact information on availability or pricing (the company is still deciding whether or not to bundle in the wireless charger), you shouldn't expect to pay less than €299 ($333) for the Zik 3s.",0.635595364453553,0.364404635546447,0.1639205349022095,586,4.9488054607508536,331,6.0,0,34,"Tech, Hands-on, IFA 2015, Photo Essay"

And that's pretty much it as far as functionality goes. Alcatel's Go Play and Go Watch hands-on photosPreviousNextView full GalleryPreviousNext And just look at that bezel. Alcatel was clearly inspired by Casio's G-Shock with this design; calling it a blatant ripoff isn't entirely unfair. The bulky designs allow for a full-size microUSB port to fit on the watch, so at least charging it up should be pretty convenient. There's no proprietary charger to carry everywhere. The Go Watch also has a heart rate monitor and a bizarre feature the company calls its ""emotion pulse measurement."" I'll just let the press release explain this one: The Go Watch brings a unique experience and lets users hack their emotions. How? Press the Go button to trigger an emotionpulse measurement. An emotional graphic will be created based on the input from the gyroscope, heart rate sensor and accelerometer. Select a theme that matches your mood the best to create your personalized emotion pulse. You can instantly share your unique emotion pulse on social networks or even set it as the wallpaper of your Go Watch. Okay. Sure. Anyway, Alcatel says the watch is waterproof, dustproof, and will typically last between two and three days on a charge. And you can swap out that front casing for options with different colors; same goes for the bands. The company is also releasing a rugged, life-proof phone to go along with Go Watch. It's called the Go Play, and offers a ruggedized build that's waterproof (IP67), shockproof, and dust proof. Alcatel says that design allows users to shoot photos and video underwater with the phone's 8-megapixel camera. Fair enough. I guess that's something my Galaxy Note 5 can't do. The company notes that this thing also has a software feature that lets you ""record cool stuff playing on your mobile screen and add a voiceover"" with the Go Play's microphone. Look, it's plain to see no one will be buying these over today's Android flagships; they're clearly seated at the lower end of handsets. Our hands-on impressions left both the Go Watch and Go Play feeling a bit cheap, but at least they've got that durability thing going. Alcatel hasn't yet announced pricing or release date for either device. ",0.5705786531377637,0.4294213468622363,0.11950453161757345,447,4.9574944071588369,284,5.852112676056338,0,0,"Tech, IFA 2015"

Every electronics company was throwing a diversity of awkward smartwatches at the wall and waiting to see what stuck. Nothing did, because they were all too big, unwieldy, and compromised. This year, though, Samsung has launched a volley so powerful and immediately convincing that it might just break the wall down entirely. I’ve just worn the first smartwatch that I would actually consider buying. The slimmer, handsomer alternative to Android Wear Samsung’s Gear S2 is unlike any other smartwatch pretender I’ve yet seen. It is the size and weight of a regular watch. It also works like a watch by showing the time all the time. That’s the baseline I expect every smartwatch to be starting from, but none had fully reached it until today. Android Wear and Pebble watches have always-on screens, but they’re all in need of either a weight loss plan or a plastic surgeon appointment. Apple’s Watch is showing up on people’s arms everywhere, but its iconic appearance is that of a big, obsidian, information-less block on the wrist. More jewelry and mobile computer than a watch.   When you retain the basic fundamentals that make a regular watch useful to people — which I would define as unobtrusive utility, as measured by a comfortable fit and unnoticeably light weight —  there’s really only very little that you need to add to make your smartwatch appealing. That’s Samsung’s enviable position with the Gear S2. This is a handsome and light watch with a beautiful and bright display. The AMOLED screen is recessed slightly underneath the Gorilla Glass covering the front, which creates a really attractive halo effect as the light emanating from the display gently bounces off the internal walls of the watch. This is complemented neatly by some delightful glow animations that signal when you reach the end of a menu or a list of items. The austere dark background seems as natural a fit to the watch as its familiar round face. The rotating bezel is both sensible and satisfying Navigating the Gear S2’s interface is done by the most ingenious (and, in retrospect, obvious) method available: a rotating bezel. Watches have had rotating bezels for decades, but they’ve never been put to much use, other than as kinetically pleasing distractions. Samsung has basically added a free control dial to its watch, which dramatically improves usability. The Gear S2 only has a 1.2-inch screen, so anything that can be done to remove the user’s finger from the touchscreen while navigating is a big plus. The awesome thing is that Samsung has implemented the rotating bezel perfectly: it has just the right amount of resistance to make scrolling through the radial app menu a pleasure. It also helps that there’s hardly any lag in the Tizen-based UI. Some will prefer Apple’s digital crown, which performs a similar function of offloading controls away from the touchscreen and to a tactile input scheme. Samsung’s approach is more intuitive, as my colleague Dan Seifert has already pointed out, and somehow more satisfying, as my experience with the Gear S2 would suggest. There's instant synergy between the rotating app menu and the controlling bezel that wraps around it. I’ve only had a brief time with the Gear S2 in my hands and on my wrist, so I don’t want to overstate my impressions of this watch. They weren’t strictly positive, either, as apps can take a while to load and Samsung still has a lot to prove. I’m under no illusions that this company’s software expertise is anywhere near its engineering prowess. That being said, Samsung has laid down the framework of a user experience that is intelligent yet simple — a PIN code, for example, is required every time the watch is taken off the wrist, as with the Apple Watch — and it’s already recruited some big-name partners to provide apps for the S2. You can use this watch’s integrated 3G radio to order up an Uber without the help of a smartphone. You can plug into the Nike+ ecosystem too. Smartwatches should start with the watch first Despite the word order in their compound title, I fervently believe smartwatches should start with the watch first. Get that element right, then layer the smart functionality on top. I don’t personally care for all of Samsung’s integrated health tracking stuff, but I don’t have to. The Gear S2’s heart rate sensor doesn’t detract from the watch’s comfort and doesn’t get in my way. I want a watch that can do smart things, not a computer that can do watch things. Samsung has been an undeniable leader in smartwatches, having kicked off the category with its Galaxy Gear two years ago right here at IFA. That pioneering role has not been a prosperous one, however, and Samsung’s been leading us through a horrendous thicket of compromised design and ergonomics, appalling battery life, and smartphone-dependent software. Today, though, I see a brilliant, round ray of hope shining through. The Gear S2 and its Tizen operating system still have everything to prove, but the potential they’ve shown is undeniable and, for me at least, irresistible.",0.6799053963003753,0.3200946036996247,0.1507895959950846,880,4.9659090909090908,473,6.2727272727272725,0,2,"Tech, Editorial, Hands-on, IFA 2015"

About a week after its launch on May 20th, LightSail lost the ability to send data to the crew because of a software glitch. Efforts to reboot the spacecraft remotely failed, so the engineers hoped LightSail would perform a ""natural reboot,"" which would occur if the spacecraft collided with stray charged particles. In a statement released yesterday through his company Planetary Society, Nye said that's exactly what happened: Our LightSail called home! It’s alive! Our LightSail spacecraft has rebooted itself, just as our engineers predicted. Everyone is delighted. We were ready for three more weeks of anxiety. In this meantime, the team has coded a software patch ready to upload. After we are confident in the data packets regarding our orbit, we will make decisions about uploading the patch and deploying our sails— and we’ll make those decisions very soon. This has been a rollercoaster for us down here on Earth, all the while our capable little spacecraft has been on orbit going about its business. In the coming two days, we will have more news, and I am hopeful now that it will be very good. LightSail was inspired by Carl Sagan's idea of solar sailing, which imagined a spacecraft using the sun similar to the way a sailboat uses the wind. The craft is composed of a small satellite with four Mylar sails attached that allow LightSail to ride solar radiation. This month's test flight hopes to prove that LightSail can successfully unfurl its sails. If the test is successful, a second flight is planned for April of next year. The scientists behind the project hope to demonstrate that solar propulsion can eliminate the need for boosters or fuel reserves in spaceflight.

At 12:30PM ET on June 2nd, NASA’s low-density supersonic decelerator (LDSD) will be tested at the US Navy’s Pacific Missile Range Facility in Kauai, Hawaii. That test brings the technology a little closer to its ultimate destination: Mars. Humans have explored the Red Planet for four decades using robotic probes. In 1976, the twin Viking landers successfully touched down on the Martian surface — the first Mars landing. In 2012, NASA’s Curiosity rover survived the ""seven minutes of terror"" known as entry, descent, and landing to successfully touch down on the Martian surface with the help of that same Viking-era parachute. That system, though reliable, is limited: it can’t support a payload of more than a ton. The technology to launch crews is currently in development, but what happens when we arrive?NASA is planning increasingly ambitious robotic missions to Mars, gearing up to a human mission in the 2030s. In preparation, the agency is constructing its next big rocket — the Space Launch System (SLS), capable of propelling its Orion spacecraft further into space than ever before. The technology to launch crews is currently in development, but what happens when we arrive? The engineering challenges are significant. Landing on Mars isn’t the same as landing on Earth, or even on the Moon. Our atmosphere is very dense; the Moon has no atmosphere at all. The Martian atmosphere is somewhere in between. That thin atmosphere means any spacecraft would need more than a parachute to land. And Mars has just enough atmosphere to rule out landing via rocket motors alone, as is done on the Moon. In order to support an eventual human mission, NASA needs technologies capable of landing between 20 to 30 metric tons on the Martian surface. The LDSD is a step in that direction: it supports payloads of two to three tons, doubling the current capabilities. NASA is betting on atmospheric drag, better known as air resistance, as a solution. Using drag for deceleration saves engines and fuel. NASA’s future Mars missions require heavy-duty planetary landers capable of delivering larger payloads and maneuvering to higher elevations. Current technology coupled with the thin Martian atmosphere make mountaintops and the high-altitude southern plains inaccessible, limiting what areas of the Red Planet we can explore.   The LDSD features three different devices meant to address these problems. Two massive, donut-shaped airbags constructed out of kevlar — dubbed supersonic inflatable aerodynamic decelerators (SIADs) — will inflate around the vehicle. By increasing the surface area of a vehicle such as Orion, the amount of air resistance will also increase, decelerating the spacecraft. To design the technology needed for this task, NASA turned their attention to the Hawaiian pufferfish. When frightened, the puffer fish inflates itself, intimidating potential predators. Engineers thought this same technique could be used as a means of deceleration. Rapidly inflating the SIAD would increase the surface area of any spacecraft bound for the Red Planet, and dramatically reduce its speed. These SIADs come in two different versions: the SIAD-R, which is meant for robotic missions and is 6 meters in diameter when deployed; and the larger SIAD-E, meant for human missions, which expands to 8 meters in diameter once inflated. The SIAD-E is designed to slow surface-bound vehicles, like Orion, from upwards of 2,600 mph — about three and a half time the speed of sound — to 1,400 mph in under three minutes. It's not practical to test these new technologies on Mars The final part of the LDSD system is a parachute that’s 30.5 meters in diameter — twice the size of the Viking-era parachute. Once the SIAD deploys and slows the payload to roughly 1,400 mph (Mach 2), the parachute takes over. It’s tasked with slowing the vehicle to subsonic speeds. All three devices will be the largest of their kind ever flown at supersonic speeds. Since it’s not practical to test these new technologies on Mars, researchers use the next best thing: the thin layer of Earth’s upper atmosphere known as the stratosphere. The LDSD will be tested over the Pacific Ocean, since that’s where the atmosphere most closely resembles Mars. By simulating the supersonic entry and descent speeds Orion and other vehicles will experience on Mars, engineers will have an idea of how well the LDSD technology will perform on Mars. During the test, a high-altitude helium balloon will carry the test vehicle to an altitude of 120,000 feet above the Earth’s surface. The test vehicle will then be released from the balloon, dropping a few thousand feet. Four small rocket motors will ignite, stabilizing the test vehicle through a controlled spin, before an OrbitalATK Star 48 solid rocket motor ignites, propelling the craft to an altitude of 180,000 feet and speeds of 2,880 mph. The eight meter SIAD will deploy, decelerating the spacecraft to about 1,400 mph before the parachute takes over, slowing the spacecraft to a safe speed for a water landing. In the last test, the parachute failedThe first full-scale test of the LDSD system at supersonic speeds was conducted at the PMRF in Hawaii in June 2014 and featured the 6-meter SIAD-R together with the massive parachute. The parachute failed. Tomorrow’s test will feature an improved parachute design. Will the new design hold up to the initial rush of supersonic wind? Or will the team recover another shredded chute? Regardless of the results, we can expect some amazing views from the onboard cameras.",0.49152696491488346,0.5084730350851165,0.8754382387499237,933,5.152197213290461,482,6.1929460580912865,1,2,"Science, Report, Space"

At an event this past week, workers destroyed 662kg of confiscated ivory in a symbolic gesture of the country's commitment to fighting African elephant poaching. China hopes to eventually end the domestic manufacturing and sale of ivory in the country. ""We will strictly control ivory processing and trade until the commercial processing and sale of ivory and its products are eventually halted,"" Zhao Shucong, head of China’s State Forestry Administration, reportedly said at the event. China hasn't laid out a timeline yet This move follows China's decision earlier this year to impose a one-year ban on ivory imports in an effort to reduce illegal trading. Since 1989's international ivory trade ban, China has seized around 90,600 pounds of ivory, according to National Geographic. At the event, Zhao outlined a 10-point plan to fight poaching, including stricter policing of wildlife trade online and offline, and running campaigns to discourage public demand, The Guardian reports. A report this April found more than 500 instances of illegal ivory for sale online over a four-day period on Craigslist alone. As much as 70 percent of the world's illegal ivory goes to China, where it is seen as a status symbol for a rising middle class, according to a report in The New York Times. The demand for ivory in China is high, so part of phasing out the industry will have to include lowering consumer demand. A recent survey by the anti-trafficking group WildAid found 95 percent of respondents in China's three largest cities — Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou — support an end to the country's ivory industry. China hopes a reduction in the legal ivory market will also decrease black market demand. But John Scanlon, secretary general of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), said that while China's decision is promising, the black market still remains a big driver of elephant poaching, which he called ""one of the most destructive forms of wildlife crime.""

Depending on the drug that an expecting mother takes,  a fetus's chance of being born with a birth defect can increase. But a large study now suggests that the one of the defects — persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn, a life-threatening condition — is probably far lower than was previously suggested. The finding could help some women, namely women who suffer from severe depression and who don’t respond to other treatments, feel more secure about their decision to take antidepressants during a pregnancy; doing so might not be nearly as risky as some studies have suggested in the past. PPHN is life-threateningBabies who are born with persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn — or PPHN — have trouble transitioning from fetal blood circulation to newborn circulation, which decreases their supply of oxygen after birth. Among the general population, a child's risk of developing PPHN is low, but some studies have found that the risk increases if an expecting mother takes antidepressants during the last few months of pregnancy. As a result, the FDA issued a warning in 2006 that said that the most  common type of antidepressant — SSRIs— had been linked to the ailment (the FDA revised its position in 2011, stating that the link was ""unclear""). Yet about 14 percent of non-pregnant women in the US have current major or minor depression. If that depression occurs during a pregnancy, it can affect mother-infant attachment, as well as the behavior and development in infants and children. Taken together, it’s easy to see why doctors might want to make sure that the link between antidepressants and PPHN is one that warrants forgoing antidepressants. The risk increase disappearedIn the study, researchers used Medicaid data to extract information about 3.8 million women, some of whom had filled a prescription for an antidepressant 90 days before giving birth and who had received a depression diagnosis. They found that, indeed, PPHN was diagnosed more frequently in babies of women who took an antidepressant during pregnancy compared with the babies of women who did not. But when the researchers accounted for other risk factors that could contribute to this difference —  factors like drug abuse, missing prenatal visits, and smoking — the increase disappeared. ""There is basically no increase after the adjustment,"" says Krista Huybrechts, a pharmacoepidemiologist at Harvard University and a co-author of the study published today in JAMA. The results do not mean that antidepressant use during the last few months of a pregnancy definitely does not increase a fetus’s risk of being born with PPHN. It’s entirely possible that the drugs do contribute, but ""if the risk increase is at all present, it is much more modest than previous studies have suggested,"" Huybrechts says. ""The study is well done,"" says Jennifer Payne, director of the Women's Mood Disorders Center at Johns Hopkins University. ""We would all love to have a large study that was able to control for all the known risk factors, so we can determine if the association is due to the antidepressant use or the underlying characteristics of the population."" The authors of this study were able to control for several risk factors, she says — something that previous studies didn’t necessarily do. Hard to know if the women took the antidepressantsThe study has some limitations that are worth considering, however. For one thing, the researchers weren’t able to verify that the women who were filling prescriptions for antidepressants were actually taking the drugs. It’s possible that they weren’t. ""Filling a prescription for an antidepressant is not equivalent to taking an antidepressant,"" says Nancy Byatt, a psychiatrist who specializes in perinatal health at the University of Massachusetts.  But an additional analysis of women who had filled two prescriptions 90 days before delivery — an act that suggests that they were taking their drugs, Huybrechts says — didn’t change the study’s results. This suggests that using women who filled one prescription probably doesn’t weaken the results. The study may have also missed some women who's depression was undiagnosed, Byatt says. ""It is well known that depression during pregnancy is under-diagnosed and under-treated."" That said, Byatt also thinks the study was well conducted. Concerns about PPHN shouldn't factor ""majorly""The finding should be reassuring for women who suffer from very severe and debilitating depression and who don’t respond to other treatments. ""There is an abundance of studies that demonstrate that exposure to depression [in the womb] is associated with bad outcomes for the baby"" — outcomes that include low birth weight, preterm birth, ""as well as postpartum depression which is associated with slower language development and lower IQ in exposed children,"" Payne explains.

The project, called Im2Calories, uses technology from DeepMind, an AI startup Google acquired in 2014. Im2Calories is meant to measure the size of food, both in absolute terms and relative to the plate it's on, and can also identify condiments. And it doesn't even matter if the picture is high-resolution or not, according to the report. Right now, the technology is still inaccurate at estimating calorie counts. Kevin Murphy, a researcher at Google, admits as much to Popular Science. ""Okay fine, maybe we get the calories off by 20 percent,"" he says. ""It doesn't matter."" The goal for Google is to minimize those inaccuracies over time, Murphy claims. There's no questioning Google's ability to collect and process data from a large number of users, but the company would still have to solve one big problem for something like Im2Calories to work: calorie counting is unreliable. A major study published in The New England Journal of Medicine in 2011 found that quality of food is a more important contributing factor than quantity. ""Conventional wisdom — to eat everything in moderation, eat fewer calories, and avoid fatty foods — isn’t the best approach,"" Dr. Dariush Mozaffarian, the lead author of the study, told The New York Times. ""Just counting calories won’t matter much unless you look at the kinds of calories you’re eating."" But even if calories were a good measure for health, food labels — the source of Google's data — have also been shown to be inaccurate. There's so much uncertainty about calorie counting that in 2010 David Kirchhoff, then-CEO of the Weight Watchers, admitted ""calorie-counting has become unhelpful"" for people trying to lose weight. (The company has since abandoned its calorie-first approach.) Google has filed a patent for Im2Calories, but there's no word yet on when the service might be available.

It doesn't fully explain gravity, for example, or the existence of a hypothetical type of matter known as dark matter — which doesn't absorb, emit, or reflect light, but is thought to outweigh visible matter in the universe by a ratio of six to one. Dark matter, extra dimensions, and micro black holes Armed with the LHC's new operating energies, physicists want to push beyond the bounds of the Standard Model and hunt for these new, unknown particles. As well as dark matter, scientists at CERN will also be looking for ""partner particles"" — new particles that are predicted by a theory known as supersymmetry, a framework that many physicists think is the best way of overcoming the limitations of the Standard Model. It's not all about particles, though: the LHC could also provide evidence of more mysterious phenomena such as extra dimensions and micro black holes. All this is to come, however.

The system breaks down into two separate products: the Powerwall is a home battery system, that comes in a 10 kWh version for $3,500, or a 7 kWh model for $3,000, excluding installation and the inverter. The unit is about three feet by four feet in size and six inches thick, and comes with integrated heat management and can fit either on the inside or outside of the wall of your home. The system is connected to the internet — Elon Musk said that the system can be used to create ""smart microgrids"" — and can be used as a redundancy system, or potentially allow a home to go off the power grid entirely. ""The whole thing is a system that just works,"" Musk told reporters during a briefing this evening. The big brother of the Powerwall is what Musk and his team are calling Powerpack — and it's where things get really interesting. They describe it as an ""infinitely scalable system"" that can work for businesses, in industrial applications, and even public utility companies, that comes in 100 kWh battery blocks that can scale from 500 kWH all the way up to 10 MWh and higher. ""Our goal here is to change the way the world uses energy at an extreme scale.""   Musk's ambitions with the battery are tremendous. He opened the press event by invoking climate change, and saying that it's ""within the power of humanity"" to change the way we produce and use power. He went on to say that he sees the Gigafactory under construction in Nevada as a product, the first of many. With 160 million Powerpacks, we could power the United States, he said, and with 2 billion, the world. The entire presentation and party, Musk said, was powered by stored solar energy. While the system is being announced today, Powerwall has been testing for a year, and has already been on sale to select customers. For the Powerpack system, Tesla will start taking orders later this year and then really ramp up production as Tesla's battery-building Gigafactory comes online. Tesla has been teasing the new system for months now, with Elon Musk casually referencing it on a call with investors last February and then hyping the new product line directly on Twitter last month. Tesla's invite for today's event was entitled ""The Missing Piece,"" and in many ways that's what Tesla Energy is for the company's electric cars. Charging an electric vehicle at home can be expensive, and while solar power offers a way to reduce those costs when the sun goes down owners have had no choice to charge their vehicles with power from the grid. A robust home battery system like Powerwall could allow owners to store that solar-generated power during the day even if they're away, and then use it to charge their vehicle at night. Batteries can absorb surplus power and flow it back into the grid when needed, evening out supply and demand, something called load shifting. But the implications for Tesla's own cars is just the beginning. The event was powered by stored solar energy Right now most storage is being added at the utility level or to businesses, which are subject to higher prices when demand is high. But energy analyst GTM believes residential storage is about to boom as well, representing almost half of the storage market by 2019, and driving the transition to a more decentralized grid. Tesla and SolarCity, run by Musk's cousin Lyndon Rive, have been positioning themselves to take advantage of this space. SolarCity has been running a pilot program that pairs its panels with Tesla batteries, and Musk, who sits on SolarCity's board, says that every SolarCity unit will come with a battery within five to ten years, and that the combined systems will drive the price of solar below that of natural gas. While Musk has been known for pushing ideas that can seem very bleeding edge, in this case he underscored what a practical, immediate solution Tesla Energy can provide. ""This is a feasible thing,"" he said. ""It’s very important to appreciate that.""

Fossil fuel is a finite resource that makes the world a dirtier, hotter place — but are automakers ready to give it up? At an event at its Hawthorne, California, headquarters last night, Tesla announced the Powerwall and Powerpack, self-contained battery cabinets designed for homes and businesses that can store solar energy, recharge off the grid when rates are low, and power a home during an outage. The Powerpacks will use cells produced by Tesla’s Gigafactory, a Nevada plant currently under construction that the company expects to produce 35 GWh worth of battery cells every year by 2020 — greater than the entire world’s cell manufacturing capacity in 2013.  Trying to solve the chicken-and-egg problem It’s a lot of batteries — way more than Tesla needs for its growing car business. That’s because Tesla needs production to reach a scale so great that it can solve the electric car business’ chicken-and-egg problem: to lower the price of EVs, you need to mass produce batteries, the single most expensive component. But you can’t do that until more people buy EVs, which they can’t do until the price goes down. It risks leaving the industry in a stalemate. Tesla’s Elon Musk is clearly aiming to make Tesla a mass-market company, but he’s nowhere near that goal yet. The Model S, which can cost well over $100,000, remains a niche product, but the upcoming Model X and mass-market Model 3 are expected to significantly expand the company’s total footprint. By 2020, it hopes to be producing 500,000 cars per year, and ""a few million"" per year by 2025. (That compares to just 10,030 in the first quarter of 2015.) Much of that projected volume comes from economies of scale, which is where Musk and large portions of the remainder of the auto industry have fundamentally disagreed on strategy. Tesla wants to ramp scale as quickly as possible — both in batteries and in infrastructure — which helps explain why it opened its patent portfolio to competitors. At a talk during January’s Automotive News World Congress in Detroit, he doubled down on the Gigafactory, promising that it would have an enormous impact on battery costs. ""It will, guaranteed. If it doesn’t, I should be fired,"" he said. But some legacy automakers are focused on where the money is, and today — particularly with gasoline prices well below their historic peaks — buyers simply aren’t paying much attention to EVs and hybrids. ""There has to be customer demand for these vehicles."" ""There has to be customer demand for these vehicles,"" Ford CEO Mark Fields told The Verge during an interview this week. ""In 2010 or ‘11 there were probably 10 or 12 electrified vehicles, and either conventional or plug-in hybrids, and they made up about 2.5 percent of the total industry. Year to date, there are over 55 electrified vehicles in the industry, and year to date, through the first quarter, they take up… 2.5 percent of the industry."" Not only are automakers citing a lack of demand for EVs, some say that government initiatives designed to decrease reliance on fossil fuels should back off until demand materializes. A federal mandate that vehicle portfolios hit 54.5 miles per gallon on average by 2025 is up for ""midterm review"" in 2018, and Fields — along with the heads of several other major automakers — are hoping that the requirements will change in the face of weak EV and hybrid uptake. ""We need to check the feasibility of reaching those goals. We need to check the customer affordability, the customer acceptance of those technologies, the impact on jobs, those type of things,"" Fields says. The question is whether automakers and their battery suppliers are hindering adoption by failing to make Gigafactory-level investments that would spur lower costs, improved battery scale, and better ranges — the kinds of ranges that meet or exceed what comparable fossil fuel cars can offer. (Musk has challenged others to build Gigafactories, but no one has made any commitments yet.) There’s at least some cursory effort underway: Chevy just recently committed to manufacturing the Bolt, an all-electric concept that debuted at this year’s North American International Auto Show and promises over 200 miles on a charge for around $30,000. Even Elon Musk, ever an antagonist of the legacy auto industry, seemed to be impressed (""Sounds like they’re going to do something significant [with EVs] with the Bolt,"" he said) — but considering that battery and hybrid adoption remains in the single digits, the commitment to affordable, high-range full electrics will have to get much larger before the pendulum swings. Tesla still has a lot to prove Of course, Tesla has a lot to prove: the Gigafactory has yet to produce a single cell, the Model 3 hasn’t reached the assembly line, and its annual sales are a rounding error away from zero compared to global giants like Toyota, Volkswagen, and GM. But barring an enormous investment in hydrogen infrastructure and ultra-efficient hydrogen production, car companies are going to have to figure it out, one way or another — even if they ultimately twist the EPA’s arm into lowering 2025 mileage requirements at the 2018 review.

But the company has now released a video showing the successful launch from a base in Texas. Blue Origin's goal is to create a cheap means of private space flight, and earlier this month, the company's president announced that it was prepared for test flights of its New Shepard rocket this year. ""The engine is ready for flight... and ready for other commercial users,"" company president Rob Meyerson said. He didn't offer a timetable, but it appears the craft was closer to launch than most expected. ""Any astronauts on board would have had a very nice journey into space and a smooth return,"" Bezos writes in a note about the launch on Blue Origin's site. There was at least one hitch, however: ""Of course one of our goals is reusability, and unfortunately we didn’t get to recover the propulsion module because we lost pressure in our hydraulic system on descent,"" Bezos writes, adding that new versions of the propulsion module are already being made. The New Shepard is a suborbital craft that will be able to fly 62 miles above land, but it won't be able to make a full orbit of the planet. Although the craft can hold three people, Blue Origin previously said the first launch will be uncrewed, and it will stay that way for a while: the company says it wants to complete about a dozen tests before sending people aboard. Blue Origin also released a less polished tracking shot of the launch, which is available to watch below.

The message they were trying to deliver was clear: Ford isn't just a Detroit car company parachuting in to work with Silicon Valley talent, they want to be a legitimate member of the Valley community. The challenges aren't small: engineering Detroit steel isn't at the top of most Stanford grads' to-do lists, though there's a palpable sense that transportation is generally becoming one of the hottest fields on the planet. It's too early to judge whether Ford and its Big Three counterparts can latch onto that wave, but it's not for lack of trying. The Palo Alto facility doesn't look any different from any other Valley startup headquarters — an unassuming building in an office complex — apart from a driving simulation room, a specially fitted garage with a Ford GT sitting in it, and a bookshelf filled with steering wheels that I noticed as I walked by. But the work is pretty unique: this is where the company hastily built an Apple Watch app to demonstrate, for instance. In all likelihood, much of Ford's work in vehicle autonomy will happen here over the years to come, alongside coworkers in Dearborn, Michigan and elsewhere. Amid the PR tour, I had a chance to chat with Ford CEO Mark Fields. Fields has been in the job for a little less than a year, but he's not wasting any time trying to make a statement. Chris Ziegler: You’ve had some time to settle into your new role now, but you have huge shoes to fill, right? Because I think Alan [Mullaly] is widely viewed as one of the most effective automotive executives of the last several decades. So what unique challenges has that presented you? To what degree do you see yourself as a caretaker for Ford right now versus someone who’s trying to push the boundaries? Mark Fields: Well, I clearly don’t consider myself a caretaker, nor have I in any of my roles throughout my career. You know, the priorities, we’ve set three priorities for the company. The first one is the acceleration of our One Ford plan. And we’ve had that plan in place for six, seven years, and it was under Alan, but I had the opportunity to kind of co-develop that with him over the years and implement it. So I don’t see any reason, just because, oh, I’m the new CEO, we need to do a Student Body Left and a completely different strategy. But I think it was as relevant six, seven years ago as it is today. Although I think what will change is the pace of progress. Because we’ve had some learnings, and we can move ourselves even faster on a number of those things. Secondly is this product excellence, deliver with passion. We want to make sure that every product that we come out with — it’s not just about competing in the segment. You know, we shouldn’t expect our customers to be more excited about our products than we are. And that’s why you have products like the Ford GT, the new F series, the new Ford Explorer that’s coming. And that means keeping the organization focused on four elements: being the best in quality, safety, fuel efficiency, and smart technology. Because you can try and do 20 different things well, and you end up only doing a couple of them well, and it confuses the organization. Every day when our people come in the door, they know that from a product excellence standpoint, those are the things we want to differentiate ourselves on. And finally, a big priority for me and for the company is driving innovation into every part of our business. And it’s looking at innovation — it’s not showing the organization a 20-page PowerPoint presentation and saying ""here’s how you innovate."" Because as a company, innovation is in our DNA. It goes right back to our founder, and what Henry Ford did. And even recently for our company — Sync, EcoBoost engines, the aluminum F-150, the GT. So this is in our blood. So for us, it’s not about teaching the organization to innovate, it’s around allowing them to do it. No matter things big or small or complex or simple. So one of the things I’m focusing on with the organization is how do we question tradition and not follow custom, not take anything for granted, and use technology where we can to enhance that customer experience. Or even if you’re in the company, if you’re not doing something for the customer, you’re doing something for another part of the company, how do we make it more effective? So those are the things that we’re working on under this banner of looking at some of these trends in the industry and the enabling technologies that are allowing those trends around connected car and autonomous vehicles and mobility, you know, car sharing, ride sharing, and how technology is changing the retail experience, the ownership experience, not only just the purchasing experience. And how are we looking at that holistically as a company, and looking at that as an opportunity, and moving the company forward. And clearly the Ford GT and the GT before it are major sources for trickle-down technology through the mainstream product lineup. But do you see that as an occasional one-off opportunity — it was, what, 10 or 11 years between those two products — or do you see that as part of Ford’s broader philosophy — we are going to have a hero product that showcases the very best of what Ford can do, and over time that technology is going to sprinkle through the lineup? Well, our GT is really the culmination of a decade’s worth of work and innovation in those three areas of aerodynamics, lightweighting, and engine technology, EcoBoost engine technology. And that’s really kind of a showcase for a lot of this technology that we put in our products, plus a lot of technology — particularly around lightweighting that you’ll see in our products going forward. So we want to show with the GT how do you get performance through innovation. It’s just one element of our business. We don’t look at it saying, well, we need one halo product and eventually all that stuff will trickle down. We want every one of our vehicles to be a halo product, so, part of it as a company — again, it goes back to our ethos as a company — is for innovations, we want to make sure innovations are accessible for everyone and not just a specific portion of the population. So when you look at our semi-autonomous features on our vehicles, you can get them on a Focus all the way up to our Lincolns in varying degrees. So it’s not a hero car for hero car’s sake. It is a technology showcase, but it’s just kind of a culmination of a lot of things that we do already, all wrapped in a sexy product. The drivetrain is a really interesting choice, and I don’t want to belabor the point, but it seems like there was an opportunity to showcase some really wild drivetrain tech there. And I’m sure that there’s still a lot of drivetrain tech going into this, but if you look at a product like the 918 or the LaFerrari, I wouldn’t say that they made too many aerodynamic compromises to make those true hybrid products. So can you talk a little more about that decision and the logic that went into that choice? There were conversations. And clearly we want to be able to challenge custom and question tradition, and one of them is, in those kind of vehicles, big V-8s are important. Well, what about a V-6? And a V-6 that produces 600-plus horsepower and gives you the power and capability of a larger displacement engine in a smaller displacement engine that is more efficient and, as Raj [Nair] says, is packaged more efficiently so you can do a lot more things with the design. Better fuel economy, which is not the most important reason for a car like the GT, but it sure does help. So we’re changing the paradigm on that, and that’s the path that we took for this particular vehicle. You know, as you know, we offer a full lineup of powertrains in many of our vehicles, everything from full electrified to plug-ins to hybrids to conventional gas engines like we have with the GT. So we look across our product portfolio and we want to make sure we’re innovating a lot of those elements, and that’s why you see that power choice across our engine lineup. Actually, I had a good conversation with Mike Tinskey last week about some of that stuff when he was in New York. But what surprised me, what really surprised me was he mentioned that penetration of the hybrid and EV powertrains is only at 1, 2, 3 percent, somewhere in that range. And I would’ve, if I had to venture a guess I would’ve guessed it was somewhere between 10 and 20 percent. So it’s interesting just how far you have to go to get to that tipping point. Is that something that you think about a lot? Are you concerned with getting to that tipping point quickly? Well, we think about it a lot. And the first thing we think about is, again, having that choice for consumers. And I think we have one of the largest choices around for the powertrains that I mentioned. But we think about it a lot because at the end of the day, there has to be customer demand for these vehicles. And it’s incumbent upon us as a manufacturer to offer them, to make them compelling. But to put it into perspective, in 2010 or '11 there were probably 10 or 12 electrified vehicles, and either conventional or plug-in hybrids, and they made up about 2.5 percent of the total industry. Year to date, there are over 55 electrified vehicles in the industry, and year to date, through the first quarter, they take up… 2.5 percent of the industry. So the success of these has to be dependent on the customer’s adoption of these technologies, and for it to make sense for them economically, and that’s why it’s so important, you know, part of the one national standard, the fuel economy requirements by 2025, which we are supportive of, it’s going to depend on that customer acceptance. And that’s why [we have] the mid-term review, which is a review that we’ve agreed with the government in 2018 is so important, because we need to check the feasibility of reaching those goals. We need to check the customer affordability, the customer acceptance of those technologies, the impact on jobs, those type of things. But that’s the facts, and right now, the adoption is not where it needs to be to reach those goals. And to what extent do you think the onus is on automakers to drive that adoption, versus other market factors? Well, I think that from our standpoint, from Ford’s standpoint, our responsibility is to offer a compelling product, and we think we’re doing that. And continue to work on the cost to make it as affordable to the customer as possible. Beyond that, you gotta, at the end of the day, you gotta have a customer who’s going to want that kind of technology. So, you know, I think that’s why this review is so important. What would you identify as the biggest limiting factor right now? I know battery scale is an ongoing problem, but is there anything else? Well, yeah, the cost of the battery. That’s the biggest challenge on electrified vehicles. The range is also an opportunity and a challenge depending upon how you look at it, because lots of folks including ourselves are working on range. And there’s elements of range anxiety that the customer has, et cetera, so we’re working hard as well as the rest of the industry to include the range capability. There’s always the infrastructure piece of it, the charging infrastructure piece of it, that needs to be worked on. So there’s a whole host of things. I was talking to some of your staff out here. They were saying that at the graduate level, there’s still perhaps a bit of a stigma around the auto industry in maybe not being their first choice. And I’m wondering — obviously this office is a part of changing that, but what other ideas do you have to try to flip that script a little bit? A couple things. What’s really important to young people these days is, you’ve got to give them meaningful work. Meaningful and interesting work. And when you look at the auto industry, not only the type of product it is, in terms of folks to get excited about, but even for folks who aren’t excited about a vehicle, how would you like to be part of a company that’s trying to change yet again how the world moves? So that higher order of, do you relate to the mission of the company? And then secondly, from a career standpoint, you can have a great career at Ford. When I go out recruiting at some of the colleges, some of the students look at me and say, ""How long have worked at Ford?"" And I say 26 years, and they look at me like I have three heads: ""26 years, my goodness, I haven’t even been alive that long!"" And my point to them is, I’ve had multiple careers during my 26 years at Ford. I’ve had the opportunity to work in different parts of the business I never thought I would. I’ve had the opportunity to live in places I never thought I would visit, nevertheless live in. So that’s another piece of joining our company, and you can have a great career and a varied career as you go through your life, and personally develop and professionally develop, but also contribute to a company. So I think another thing I mentioned out there was that cars offer perhaps a bigger canvas for designers than anything else on the planet, especially now that smartphones are just glass rectangles, whereas cars take all shapes and sizes. Is there any sort of feedback loop between the designers inside the company and the technologists inside the company? Is that a two-way conversation, or are they culturally very different groups inside the company? More and more it’s a combination effort, because traditionally in the car business you would have the seat engineer work on the seat; you’d have the HVAC engineer work on the HVAC, and you’d optimize it for that. Sometimes the flow of that worked, and sometimes you thought to yourself, ""What?"" Design by committee, right? Yeah, or these knobs are square, and those are round, and that’s kinda weird. We want our — I want our engineers thinking about experiences. And then how does technology enable that experience, as opposed to just thinking about technology. So we’re spending a lot of time on that, for the lack of a better term, that user experience and that design experience. And that requires our designers to work very closely with our technologists to come up with ""wow"" kinds of experiences. An example is, when you approach our Lincolns, our Lincoln MKC and our new MKX which are coming out, as you approach the vehicle, the lights will come on, both exterior and interior, welcome you to the vehicle. That was getting our designers working our technologists particularly around lighting, and working around together to say, ""Gee, how do we make a warm and embracing experience as you get to the vehicle?"" As opposed to, ""Hey, there’s this cool technology that will make the lights come on, and maybe we’ll do it on the rear of the vehicle but not on the inside,"" so you just think differently. I do want to touch on Smart Mobility, because I know that’s a big push for you. It seems like a lot of this stuff — particularly something like the Ford GT, is in fundamental conflict with Smart Mobility and some of those initiatives, right? Because one is very much focused on the mass transit-style commuter, someone who doesn’t own a car and doesn’t necessarily want to own a car ever, and then you have something that’s for the pure enthusiast. And I wonder, looking 10 or 20 years into the future, how does Ford sort of preserve its DNA and also push into these segments that are frankly kind of anti-car? It’s a great question, because I think what you’re seeing just with the GT itself, we not only love driving, we love advanced technology. And advanced technology obviously applies to hardware but it also applies to some of these things that we’re doing with these mobility experiments. So we don’t view driving and mobility and autonomy as mutually exclusive, because we want to make progress on all those fronts. So, you know, as we think about our business, part of our strategy is being a full family of vehicles serving all markets, and one of the other important parts of our strategy is to make sure that we lead in innovative mobility solutions. So, you can do both. You just have to have a point of view as a company that has one foot in today, that says, ""Okay, what do you have to deliver today in terms of products, in terms of monthly sales, in terms of quarterly financials,"" all that kind of good stuff. And then one foot in the future that says, as a company, ""What do we view the world as in 10 or 15 years? What do we want to play and how do we want to play?"" And then rewind back to today and make the appropriate capital allocation decisions, resource decisions to set you up for that. And for us, that future is around — there’s going to be customers who want to own a vehicle and want that joy of driving, and we’re going to be there for them and we’re going to be there with a very compelling experience. There’s going to be other customers, particularly in major urban areas, who want access versus ownership. And that’s why, focusing on these mobility experiences and these experiments, we’re going to learn how do we solve some of these customer and societal issues, but are there business opportunities that are in there for us that will complement our traditional business?",0.6527038232289738,0.3472961767710262,0.14834422847976578,3150,4.6358730158730159,1041,6.4514889529298749,0,8,"Transportation, Interview"

Just take a look at the most popular films released then: Raiders of the Lost Ark, The Evil Dead, Escape from New York, Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior, to name a few. But often overlooked is the cult classic Scanners, gore-master David Cronenberg's breakout film about psychic warriors.  That shouldn't be the case anymore. Scanners is getting a beautiful new home edition (Blu-ray, DVD, and iTunes) from the Criterion Collection, complete with all new, mind-blowing box art from illustrator Connor Willumsen. Willumsen says that each illustration is a collage of several different pencil drawings. The artist was inspired by photography tropes, cubism, and the film itself. ""The movie's fundamental premise is that some people have the ability to overlap their nervous systems remotely and can therefore share all of their experience and feeling simultaneously,"" Willumsen explains. ""The idea seemed appropriate and natural."" The new Criterion Collection edition contains a restored 2K digital transfer of the film supervised by Cronenberg himself and is bursting with special features, including a special effects documentary, a new interview with lead villain Michael Ironside, and even a restored 2K edition of Cronenberg's first feature, Stereo. It's also available now for half-off at Barnes & Noble and iTunes. That should be enough to make any cinephile's brain...well, you get the picture.  Courtesy the Criterion Collection.

The Japanese fast-fashion behemoth bounces between tasteful minimalism and bland normcore that your dad would find suspicious for all the wrong reasons. But if there’s one thing just about everyone can agree on, it’s that Uniqlo is a pretty great place to go T-shirt shopping. The store produces new designs and collaborations at a dizzying pace, and earlier this year launched ""The New Model T"" — a redesign with stronger materials and no seams along the side. The new UT line is now under the creative direction of Nigo, who founded legendary Japanese streetware label A Bathing Ape, with Pharrell Williams on board as the public face of the brand. And now you can design your own Uniqlo tee straight from your smartphone.   The UTme service, which recently launched in Japan, is a simple app for iOS, Android, and web that gives you a reasonable degree of freedom to create, print, and buy your own designs. There are some major limitations — right now it only offers white shirts, and you're given a fairly small area on the chest to work with — but there's a lot to like about the app as well. Each shirt starts off as a blank canvas, giving you the option to add ""paint,"" type, or photos, and you can choose to upload your creation to the website for the world to see. There's nothing stopping you from creating a design in a more user-friendly app These interfaces have their quirks. The painting option is difficult to get solid results from, and much better suited to rough designs — there's no way to draw lines or shapes beside free-form finger painting, and your color palette is limited. Typographical functionality is very basic, too, only letting you use Uniqlo's trademark font with almost no freedom over placement. Still, the company has designed UTme! to be fun and creative even when you stick to the built-in tools. Drawing with your fingers results in realistic paint spatters across the T-shirt canvas, heightening the sense that your design is your own work. You can customize further by splashing and glitching your image after the fact, with unusually involving input methods; I achieved the glitching effect on the T-shirt above by shaking the phone to make the design flicker like a broken monitor. But while this functionality won't be for everyone, you can import your own photos or other images from the camera roll, so there's nothing stopping you from creating your design in a more user-friendly app. Nothing except Uniqlo's policies, that is — my first two attempts at ordering shirts were rebuffed within a couple of hours. The first design, a photo of our social media manager Sam Sheffer with a glitzy ""The Verge"" wordmark underneath, was rejected for no given reason, and the second, a simple hand-drawn Penrose triangle with the word ""Verge"" next to it, was turned down because it might have infringed on The Verge's intellectual property. Uniqlo clearly has human staff monitoring each submission and sending out rejection emails.  But I got my Verge T-shirt in the end without too much trouble — just removing the word ""Verge"" did the trick. I ordered it along with a design based on a photo I took on the Japanese island of Niijima, which I wrote across the top in white text. Each T-shirt cost ¥1,990 (about $20) and arrived lightning-fast; I ordered on a Tuesday night and took delivery Thursday morning. The quality of the inkjet print is decent, with the Verge logo printed in bold primary colors and the high-contrast Niijima photo turning out well enough, if not quite across the full spectrum of hues. Of course there's nothing new about ordering custom T-shirts online, but the design of the UTme app combined with Uniqlo's obvious cachet in the area makes it the most interesting option yet. There's no word on when or whether UTme will make it outside of Japan, however, so your dreams of quick, easy, and smartphone-powered T-shirt creation may have to be put on hold for the time being.",0.615893472280388,0.38410652771961196,0.15346011641315963,699,4.8240343347639483,399,5.844611528822055,0,0,"Design, Report"

That's just one foot shorter than One World Trade, if you count the spire. Without the spires, Nordstrom Tower will beat the symbolic office building: according to the plans, its roof (including the parapet) will reach 1,479 feet, 78 feet higher than 1 WTC. That mighty height will make Nordstrom Tower the tallest residential building in the world, beating out the current record holder, Dubai's Princess Tower (1,358 feet), as well as Mumbai's One World Tower (1,450 feet) and 432 Park Ave (1,398 feet) in Manhattan, both of which are under construction.

Those updated specifications also reduced the size of the building's distinctive — and hotly debated — cantilever, which extends almost thirty stories above a neighboring historic building for additional floor space.

Most are chintzy devices that can do little more than project endless slideshows and a visual aesthetic that would feel at home in the SkyMall catalog. What’s worse, many still require you to hassle with USB cords and SD cards to feed them images. Today a startup called Electric Objects is setting out to change that. It’s taken the basic concept of the digital picture frame and reimagined it as something bigger and more ambitious, a smart, internet-connected screen that was built as a platform for showcasing great art. Electric Objects is the brainchild of Jake Levine, a former Betaworks employee who helped lead the resurrection of Digg. Levine was inspired by thinkers from Xerox Parc, who predicted back in the 1990s that the PC era would be followed by an era of ""calm technology"" in which computing would happen at the periphery of our awareness. ""For the last 40 years computers have been about increasing our productivity or letting us play games,"" says Levine.  ""We’re building an ambient computer that contributes to your environment even if you don’t interact with it."" ""An ambient computer that contributes to your environment even if you don’t interact with it. After raising $1.7 million in venture capital to hire an initial team and putting the first hundred or so prototypes into the wild for testing, Electric Objects is launching a Kickstarter today to give anyone the chance to own a device called EO1. For $299, backers get a 23-inch, 1080p display with a white or black frame and a wall mount. The screen has no glass cover, an attempt to keep glare to an absolute minimum. Inside is a dual core processor with 2GB of RAM running a modified version of Android that does little more than launch a bare browser window to render images, animations, and web-based visualizations. Bill Cowles, who manages the hardware for Electric Objects, says the current prototype consumes as much electricity each day as the average light bulb, and that even if you leave a single image on for days, it won’t suffer from screen burn. The team is meeting with suppliers and manufacturing partners and will have to make some adjustments on the final parts and specs based on the final number of orders from the Kickstarter project.   The device will have an ambient light sensor, so it will become brighter when exposed to direct sunlight and dim so as not to overwhelm a dark room with its glow. It can be set to turn on and off at a certain time, and it has a few simple social features built in — you could set your screen to follow what’s displayed on a friend’s, for example. But overall it’s not a super smart box, and that is kind of the point. You set the artwork using the company’s website or mobile app and then, well, then you don’t do anything. The device is something more than a screen but less than a tablet: you can’t control it through touch, and while you could change the image as often as you like, the idea is to interject a little permanence into lives filled with far too many Twitter streams and browser tabs. ""The user should be able to keep their distance from it,"" explains Levine. ""Interaction turns it back into a computer. Distance helps preserve the kind of relationship we have with physical works of art."" For folks who can’t afford the real thing, EO1 is an easy way to get a nice variety of classic and contemporary art on your wall. At launch, a partnership with the New York Public Library will let users subscribe to packages of classical paintings and prints. But where the company really hopes the device will shine is displaying internet art, so it will also feature selections from the Museum of the Moving Image and the Betaworks startups Giphy and Digg that aim to showcase the best in highbrow animated GIFs. ""There is a lot of great art being created on the internet and for the internet today, but no way for people to really showcase and savor it,"" Levine says. ""Images are trapped on tiny phones or mixed in with a million tabs on your laptop. This device is purpose-built to make internet art look great.""   The team made sure the EO1 runs Javascript well so that artists could create works that aren’t just static images or looped animations, but dynamic internet artworks. ""There are sensors all over our home and in our devices that are constantly gathering data"" said Jacob Bijani, a former Tumblr developer who heads up Electric Objects’ software side. ""We wanted EO1 to be able to display art that changes in real-time based on that stimulus."" Imagine a painting that changes to reflect the upcoming weather, or melts at a certain rate based on the temperature outside. Since the idea is to have pieces remain on-screen for long periods of the time, the team recommends artworks that have subtle changes, like a gently shifting forest or endlessly shimmering sunset. The company is also trying to create its own community of creators who are making original works created just for Electric Objects, and has hired Zoë Salditch, formerly of the digital arts organization Rhizome, to manage relationships with independent artists and galleries. The EO1 will initially only be available in portrait orientation and a 16:9 aspect ratio, so that anyone creating for it won’t have to worry about multiple form factors. Levine and the Electric Object team have a running joke that any decision they make about the shape and size will ""act as a creative constraint to further inspire the artists."" ""The irony is not lost on me  —  that in 2014 our idea of an exploration is a return to what for centuries has been the norm."" The company says it will have its own app store of sorts, where it will showcase new offerings from artists for users to download. ""People can use this for family photos, of course, but based on what we feature, we’re going to be pushing to create a community that’s more focused on art,"" says Levine. In the app store vein, the company will also be launching with an open API that it hopes will ""inspire developers and artists to show us what they would do with a quiet, peripheral, ambient, always-on, connected screen."" Around 100 beta testers have been using the device, and Levine says many enjoy how little functionality it has compared to their phone or laptop. ""The participants in this experiment are a living lab, an exploration into a new form of attention, one that’s been neglected by our always-be-updating, permission-to-send-you-notifications connected world,"" Levine wrote in a blog post. ""The irony is not lost on me  —  that in 2014 our idea of an exploration is a return to what for centuries has been the norm: stillness, silence, contemplation.""",0.7332944054196714,0.2667055945803286,0.17809983384807773,1182,4.7969543147208125,584,6.1506849315068495,0,0,"Culture, Design, Tech, Web, Report"

In another, statuesque models lounge on a digital beach as a hurricane of golf balls storms overhead. Down the hall, a black reverend is reading the bible on the back of a centaur in an airport, waiting for a plane that’s buried in snow. As visitors to this museum in Switzerland shuffle from one space to the next, Tatiana Arzamasova looks on with regal dispassion, her hair a wild flame of red against cold white walls. It’s a sleepy Saturday afternoon in the idyllic city La Chaux-de-Fonds, and Arzamasova — dressed in a bright red dress with a huge matching bow across her chest — is here for the opening of the Liminal Space Trilogy: a series of stylized and often unsettling films about heaven, hell, and purgatory. The first installment, Last Riot, caused a stir in the art world when it debuted at the Venice Biennale in 2007, catapulting Arzamasova, 59, and her Moscow-based collective, AES+F, to new levels of international fame. The subsequent videos, Feast of Trimalchio (2009) and Allegoria Sacra (2011), have been met with similar acclaim, challenging viewers with their jarring visual effects, clashing symbolism, and opaque social commentary.  Saturday’s opening was held with much pomp, as visitors sipped cocktails and mingled with costumed models at the Musée des Beaux Arts, but Arzamasova has become comfortable with the attention. For nearly three decades, she and her partners — Evgeny Svyatsky, Vladimir Fridkes, and Lev Evzovitch (also her husband) — have been creating videos, sculptures, and digital projects together as AES+F, rising in tandem with Russia’s post-Soviet art boom during the late 1990s and early 2000s. Their work has been shown in scores of galleries and museums across the globe, often with provocative motifs. Their 1996 installation, The Islamic Project, features an image of the Statue of Liberty wearing a burqa. Europe-Europe, completed in 2007, includes a porcelain figurine of a neo-Nazi girl lovingly twirling the hair of a Hasidic Jewish boy. The imagery in the Liminal Space Trilogy isn’t as overtly political as some of their earlier work, but the project relies on many of the same clashes and collisions: East and West, antiquity and modernity, man and machine. The 39-minute Allegoria Sacra, based on an Italian Renaissance painting of the same name, opens at an airport — the contemporary version of purgatory — where Africans, Indians, and East Asians are waiting alongside a centaur, a skinhead, and a Christlike figure. The Feast of Trimalchio, inspired by an ancient Roman text, depicts ""paradise"" as a digitally rendered beach-ski resort, where power dynamics and relations appear to have blurred, if not dissolved completely. In one scene, the hotel’s Asian waitstaff lounge before a table full of fruit; in another, people dressed in tribal garb receive massages. The three films are all devoid of dialogue, relying instead on classical scores and the slow-motion movements of actors against a green-screen digital backdrop. At times, they seem balletic. More often than not, they’re profoundly creepy — especially in Last Riot and Trimalchio. In each film, the actors are ""animated"" by stitching together still photographs, resulting in characters that Evzovitch describes as ""a little bit robotic, a little bit alien."" Their movements are glitchy and uneven, their gazes cold and aloof. When displayed on giant screens, as the films were in Switzerland, the effect is downright chilling.  The artists see their work as a reflection of modern life — full of instability, vanity, and cultural collisions — which they cast in landscapes that are both digital and baroque. But the Trilogy makes obvious gestures toward the future, as well. Spaceships hover above an apocalyptic desert wasteland in Last Riot. Allegoria Sacra concludes with the birth of a baby with a reptilian tail, surrounded by women dressed in the white costumes from Stanley Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey. There are political allusions, to be sure; small American tanks roll through the desert, and an airplane morphs into an enormous Chinese dragon. But the Trilogy, like all of AES+F’s work, refrains from declarative statements or binaries. ""We never make direct conclusions and we never comment on things [that] are obvious,"" says Evzovitch, his long gray hair tied into a ponytail behind square shoulders. ""We never work with [Russian President Vladimir] Putin, for example, because he is obviously very bad, so it’s not interesting for us."" Arzamasova and Evzovitch met when they were students at the Moscow Architectural Institute during the late 1970s, and both went on to have successful careers as conceptual architects. (Evzovitch worked in animation and film art direction, as well.) But it wasn’t until a friend introduced them to Syvatsky, a graphic designer by trade, that they decided to work together. They first collaborated on a design project for Moscow’s School of Dramatic Arts, and soon embarked on their own art projects as AES, which they formed in 1987. The ""+F"" came in 1995 with the addition of Fridkes, a former journalist and prominent fashion photographer whose images have appeared in magazines like Vogue and Elle. All four grew up in Moscow, and have borne witness to the dramatic changes Russia saw during and after the Cold War. Although they acknowledge that art and information were filtered through Soviet censors when they were young, they say it wasn’t as repressive as many believe.  ""The image of the [Soviet Union] in the West was a little bit distorted by propaganda,"" Svyatsky says, his thick black eyebrows raising into an arch. ""People had an image of a country that was totally closed from any kind of information, cultural information. It wasn’t like that."" At first, they treated the collective as a side project, and continued taking commissions for commercial projects. That changed with Islamic Project, an installation that envisioned a future world dominated by Islam. Word of the project spread quickly throughout the media, and they eventually devoted themselves to AES+F full-time, buoyed by a Russian art market that was suddenly flush with cash from Moscow’s growing upper class. All four members still live in Moscow, but they’ve recently considered relocating to Berlin, in part because of what Evzovitch describes as a ""disgusting atmosphere"" for artists under Putin’s government. The Kremlin has cracked down on free speech in recent years as part of Putin’s ongoing efforts to promote ""traditional"" Russian values. AES+F haven’t been persecuted or censored, though they say authorities have inquired about their work, and they remain uncertain about their future. For now, though, AES+F is focused on their next project, Inverso Mundus, which they describe as a digital collage inspired by medieval engravings. They’ll also continue showing the Liminal Trilogy around the world, but Arzamasova says she’s only concerned with what comes next. ""I’m only in love with what I’m doing now,"" she said over dinner after Saturday’s opening in Switzerland. ""I have no nostalgia. Once the projects are done they’re not my children — they’re their own creatures, off into the world."" All images copyright and published with the permission of AES+F.

The commission has previously given the conditions that data should be sold among a larger group of assets, that the privacy policy should be maintained, and that the buyer be in the same general line of business.

I played hide and seek. They wouldn’t even look for me."" Like the late American comedian Rodney Dangerfield, HTC is a company suffering from a chronic lack of respect. The Taiwanese phone maker has a pedigree of mobile innovation rivaling that of Nokia and Apple, but last week it had to change its CEO amid ambivalent feedback to its latest smartphone and a struggle to generate consistent profits. There are many challenges for new CEO Cher Wang to overcome in the months ahead, but beside the technical issue of just building better cameras, probably the most critical among them will be to reestablish the company’s respectability. The invisible missing ingredient for HTC in the past few years has been the respect and cooperation of mobile carriers. It’s not a coincidence that the biggest successes of the smartphone era, Apple’s iPhone and Samsung’s Galaxy series, are available on every carrier in almost every country in the world. Those devices are prominently promoted and sold in their native state, exactly as their maker intended. There will never be an iDroid on Verizon, and Samsung’s vast scale has recently helped it escape the silly rebranding and redesign exercises enforced by the brain trusts at AT&T and Big Red. HTC is in precisely the opposite position. It needs carriers, carriers don’t feel like they need it.  The bloatware apps you can’t uninstall on your HTC One? Blame carrier deals. Delays in updating to the latest Android version? Carrier certification is usually what takes the longest (though Google isn’t helping matters, either, with HTC typically getting the latest Android code at roughly the same time as Google announces it). HTC is deeply aware of the things it needs to deliver to make its phones compelling, but it’s habitually tripped up by the partners who are supposed to aid it in that quest. Some of HTC's wounds have been self-inflicted The asymmetric relationship with carriers might be a vestige of HTC’s history as a white-label manufacturer whose devices once bore better-known brands. A more likely culprit, though, is the simple fact that the small and mighty HTC is now defined more by its smallness than its mightiness. It’s been a long time since HTC’s 2011 apogee of being the leading smartphone manufacturer in the US, and some of its wounds have been self-inflicted. Two years ago, the flagship One M7 smartphone was leaked by none other than HTC’s then-CEO, Peter Chou, who waved it excitedly on a stage in front of hundreds. A year later, a teenager on YouTube preempted the One M8 announcement with a 12-minute hands-on overview, and this year’s M9 has been the most comprehensive leak of them all. Pictures, promo videos, and even in-depth impressions of the new phone emerged in the days ahead of its big launch. HTC’s pursuit of the widest possible coverage — both in terms of press attention and store distribution — is costing it the quality and secrecy of its products. It’s noteworthy that the Vive virtual reality headset, which HTC didn’t have to distribute to carrier and retailer partners ahead of time, managed to remain completely secret until the moment of its announcement. It’s an odd situation, because the factors tripping up HTC tend to reside outside of its control, but it’s the company’s own decisions that have led to its present state of dependency. The Vive VR headset shows that HTC can still innovate in secret — so long as there are no mobile carriers involved HTC’s legacy of great design and bold risk taking feels like it’s worth more respect than the company is currently getting. Long before Apple could build an all-metal iPhone, HTC dared to encase an entire phone in aluminum with its 2010 Legend. Before Samsung made the large-screen smartphone category its own, it was the seminal HTC HD2 that had the first 4.3-inch touchscreen. HTC also built the first ever Android phone, the T-Mobile G1, and the first 4G smartphone in the USA, the EVO 4G. But not every risk taken by HTC has been a good one, with its investments in 3D imaging (a gimmick), UltraPixel and DuoCam camera technology (dual gimmicks), and Beats Audio (a branding gimmick) all undermining its status as a reliable technology leader. Respect is something to be earned rather than demanded. HTC's hardware design team has earned it. Now the rest of the company needs to step up to the same standard.

Scattered around the country are massive warehouses staffed by workers who spend their days picking objects off shelves and putting them in boxes. During the holiday season, the company calls on a huge reserve army of temporary laborers. The work is repetitive and physically demanding and can pay several dollars above minimum wage, yet Amazon is requiring these workers — even seasonal ones — to sign strict and far-reaching noncompete agreements. The Amazon contract, obtained by The Verge, requires employees to promise that they will not work at any company where they ""directly or indirectly"" support  any good or service that competes with those they helped support at Amazon, for a year and a half after their brief stints at Amazon end. Of course, the company’s warehouses are the beating heart of Amazon’s online shopping empire, the extraordinary breadth of which has earned it the title of ""the Everything Store,"" so Amazon appears to be requiring temp workers to foreswear a sizable portion of the global economy in exchange for a several-months-long hourly warehouse gig. The company has even required its permanent warehouse workers who get laid off to reaffirm their non-compete contracts as a condition of receiving severance pay. When Amazon shut down a massive warehouse in Coffeyville, Kansas, earlier this year, hundreds of employees lost work. One laid-off warehouse worker, who earned just over $12 an hour unloading inbound freight at the Coffeyville facility, showed The Verge a clause in her severance agreement that admonished her to ""fully comply"" with the noncompetition agreement. This worker wished to remain anonymous because of a non-disclosure agreement she signed with Amazon. ""It is quite broad in its scope,"" says Orly Lobel a professor of labor and employment law at University of San Diego, who has studied noncompetes extensively and reviewed the Amazon agreement. ""During employment and for 18 months after the Separation Date, Employee will not, directly or indirectly, whether on Employee’s own behalf or on behalf of any other entity (for example, as an employee, agent, partner, or consultant), engage in or support the development, manufacture, marketing, or sale of any product or service that competes or is intended to compete with any product or service sold, offered, or otherwise provided by Amazon (or intended to be sold, offered, or otherwise provided by Amazon in the future) that Employee worked on or supported, or about which Employee obtained or received Confidential Information."" Noncompete agreements have traditionally been associated with highly skilled, white collar jobs where, in exchange for signing a restrictive contract, employees might gain specialized training and learn trade secrets that enable professional advancement. More recently, such contracts have been seeping into low-skilled and low-wage occupations that require little on-the-job training. This trend is likely occurring at least in part because employers know they can get away with it in today’s economy, where jobs are scarce, says Charlotte Garden, a law professor at Seattle University School of Law. ""When you have a more vulnerable workforce applying for jobs,"" Garden says, ""they’re not going to attempt to negotiate the terms of the  contract they’re handed."" The expansion of noncompetes into low-wage work came to national attention last year, when the Huffington Post reported that Jimmy John’s had some of its permanent workers sign noncompete agreements that covered sandwich sellers within three miles of Jimmy John’s locations. US Congress members called for a federal investigation into the sandwich chain's use of the agreements. The Amazon contract appears more extreme: it is not only being pushed on temporary workers, who will have their opportunities inevitably constrained upon their planned dismissal, but it is also explicit in its potentially limitless geographic reach. ""Employee recognizes that the restrictions in this section 4 may significantly limit Employee’s future flexibility in many ways,"" the agreement asserts, referencing the section containing the noncompete agreement and three other clauses. ""Employee further recognizes that the geographic areas for many of Amazon’s products and services — and, by extension, the geographic areas applicable to certain restrictions in this Section 4 — are extremely broad and in many cases worldwide."" The contract — which was obtained through applying and being accepted to a seasonal Amazon warehouse position — even includes a provision that requires employees who sign it to ""disclose and provide a true and correct copy of this Agreement to any prospective new employer [...] BEFORE accepting employment[…]"" Laid-off employees were asked to reaffirm the noncompete contract as a condition of receiving severance: ""Employee understands and agrees that Employee has continuing obligations under the Nondisclosure and Noncompetition Agreement reaffirms those commitments in this Agreement, and agrees that, as part of this Agreement, Employee will comply fully with the terms of the Nondisclosure and Noncompetition Agreement."" It’s unclear whether Amazon has attempted to enforce its noncompete contracts with hourly warehouse workers, and Amazon did not respond when asked about this by The Verge. But the company does have a history of aggressively pursuing such cases against white collar workers. Last year, after a former Amazon marketing manager took a job at Google, Amazon leveled a suit against him that was said to test the limits of noncompete law. The willingness of courts to validate such agreements can vary dramatically across states. But regardless of whether courts are willing to enforce them, noncompetes can still affect workers’ behavior. Regina Lee, a seasonal Amazon worker who signed a noncompete, takes the agreement seriously. In recent years, as Lee has struggled to find decent-paying work, she has become a both loyal and grateful member of Amazon’s army of seasonal warehouse workers. ""Before I worked at Amazon, I applied to Walmart, and I didn't get anywhere, so I'm just happy to have a job,"" Lee says. ""Especially a job I can go back to every winter."" Lee says that, during last year’s pre-Christmas rush, Amazon’s human resources team in Coffeyville, Kansas, helped accommodate her when she suffered an allergic reaction that caused her to need to switch to a different job within the warehouse. ""It was above and beyond anything my previous employers would have done,"" Lee said. Lee wants to continue her seasonal work at Amazon, and because of the noncompete that she’s signed, she would be careful if she were to apply for a second job at an Amazon competitor like Sam’s Club, the wholesale subsidiary of Walmart. Lee says, in this hypothetical scenario, she would be clear with the hiring agents at Sam’s Club about the noncompete she’d signed at Amazon and would also contact Amazon to ask for permission for working at Sam’s Club. ""I’d send Amazon a thing and say: ‘I applied at Sam's Club. How do you feel?’"" Lee said. ""Then it would be up to Sam's Club to hire me and up to Amazon to say yes or no."" Lee’s husband, Ray, is also a seasonal Amazon worker and says that he believes the noncompete contract only applies to trade secrets: ""How technical is it to go and box stuff everyday and send it off?"" Apart from their Amazon work, the couple has sought work at theme parks and campgrounds and have not had their behavior affected by noncompete agreements. Several former Amazon workers in Kansas and Tennessee said that they had vague recollections of signing a noncompete agreement but did not give it much consideration. Two workers who had left Amazon warehouse jobs in 2012 and 2013 said they had no recollection of signing a non-compete agreement. It is unclear when Amazon began having warehouse workers sign this agreement, and the company did not respond to questions sent by The Verge about this. Two other Amazon workers approached by The Verge cited the nondisclosure agreement they had signed with the company in refusing to share their experiences for this story. Amazon did not respond to a question asking for examples of jobs the agreement would bar its former warehouse workers from taking. But it should be noted that some of America’s largest employers, retailers like Walmart and Target, have established across-the-board programs to match prices of goods sold on Amazon.com, bringing the products sold in thousands of retail stores across the country into even more direct competition with those sorted through Amazon warehouses across the country. Although companies may push noncompetes on low-wage workers to keep trade secrets from leaking, there’s also a more cynical explanation: to simply deprive competitors of employees to hire, according to Lobel. Noncompetes can also depress workers’ wages. Traditionally, a key strategy to keep employees from defecting to a competitor has been simply to offer competitive wages, but a company that uses non-compete agreements can feel less pressure to pay well. In this way, noncompetes can exacerbate structural inequalities in the current job market, inequalities which themselves make noncompetes easier for companies to demand. In America’s post-recession economy, job seekers continue to vastly outnumber openings for good jobs. In this setting, workers don’t have much leverage when haggling with employers over terms and conditions of work. One effect of this has been the expansion of the so-called ""gig economy"", where apps like Uber and TaskRabbit draw on a pool of freelancers ready to perform quick jobs that become available with no attendant promise of benefits or job security. Large numbers of unemployed and underemployed have also fueled the boom in temp-agency staffing that has accounted for significant portions of the country’s post-recession job gains. A lack of negotiating power can lead workers to sign noncompete contracts, Lobel says, and those contracts further erode their negotiating power. Because noncompetes make job loss more perilous by limiting post-employment opportunities, the agreements can tether workers to their current job, making them less likely to address grievances with management or attempt to look for better or more fitting work. ""The decisions of whether to leave or not become distorted by the fact that there's this stick over their heads in the post-employment phase,"" says Lobel, who examined the economic effects of noncompetes in her recent book titled Talent Wants to Be Free. ""People very well might decide that, despite their unhappiness with their job, despite the fact that they think they can do better with another employer, they might decide that it's just not worth the risk and that they should just lay low."" Courts are often reluctant to enforce noncompete agreements that cover the entire United States, let alone the whole world, according to Garden, who notes that the standard of ""reasonableness"" is the main legal test of the agreements. Yet different states have far different ideas of what counts as reasonable. (In an apparent nod to this, the Amazon contract stipulates that the signer consents that ""each and every covenant and restraint in this Agreement is reasonable."") California law bans the enforcement of noncompetes. Oregon, North Dakota, and Colorado have also enacted strict limits on noncompetes. ""Then there are states like Texas and Florida and a bunch of others that are on the other end of the spectrum,"" says Lobel, ""that think of it as a simple contract issue, and if you sign the contract and you breach it then, well, you've breached the contract, and they'll enforce it, and they'll give injunctions quite easily."" Such threats can have very concrete effects on workers. In the case of Jimmy John’s, a number of former workers have sued the company in part for what they call the ""oppressive"" effects of the sandwich chain’s noncompete clause. One former Jimmy John’s employee in the suit alleges that, after leaving the sandwich chain, she had taken a telemarketing job that paid less than she could have earned bartending — all because of the sandwich company’s noncompete. The AP recently found that Jimmy John’s workers are not alone in suffering real-life consequences of signing the agreements, which, according to court records, have also ensnared nail stylists, maids, and agricultural workers. In Massachusetts, a barbershop  forced one of its former hairdressers who had signed a noncompete into unemployment after he took a job at a competitor. The signing of noncompete agreements are more prevalent in states that are more willing to enforce the contracts, according to preliminary findings of a study conducted by scholars at University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign and the University of Michigan. The paper, which polled more than 10,000 workers across the country with an online survey, also indicates that noncompetes are prevalent in jobs that often require little training. The survey found that at least 12 percent of US workers, or at least 19 million Americans, are working under the agreements. The paper found that roughly 9 percent of transportation and warehousing workers who answered the survey were working under noncompete contracts. (This statistic is an underestimation, says Evan Starr, a co-author of the study, because many people who sign noncompetes are unaware that they’ve done so.) The paper goes on to assert that while the millions of low-skilled workers signing the contracts ""are far less likely to bargain over their noncompetes, they receive little in return for signing, but may bear serious costs."" Starr, who reviewed the Amazon agreement, said that while attorneys may differ in their interpretations on which services count as having been ""supported"" by a warehouse employee, the 18-month duration seems ""incredibly long,"" especially for a temporary job. In the case of a stint lasting three months, the restrictions would stretch six times longer than the actual length of employment, Starr noted in an email. ""A restriction like this could only be credible if the type of information the individual learned in a short time could be very damaging to the firms."" Yet Garden, the Seattle University law professor, notes that such a contract being legally enforceable may in fact be entirely beside the point in a low-wage workplace. ""One way to look at this is as a kind of invidious approach to having workers sign a contract that is very likely to be unenforceable,"" Garden says. ""Knowing that people who have been working for 10 and 11 dollars an hour are not going to be able to hire a lawyer to fight for them later on.""",0.5173809986186861,0.48261900138131386,0.8504653839444535,2377,5.2974337400084144,1005,6.7791044776119405,0,8,"Business, Tech, Report"

But in testimony before a Senate subcommittee today, Amazon argued that the government wasn't moving nearly fast enough. ""This approval came last Thursday, and we’re eager to get flying here as we have been abroad,"" said Paul Misener, Amazon's vice president for Global Public Policy. But ""while the FAA was considering our applications for testing, we innovated so rapidly that the [drone] approved last week by the FAA has become obsolete. We don’t test it anymore. We’ve moved on to more advanced designs that we already are testing abroad."" The FAA took one and half years to give Amazon permission to fly one very specific model of drone. Misener compared this to what is happening overseas. ""Nowhere outside of the United States have we been required to wait more than one or two months to begin testing, and permission has been granted for operating a category of UAS, giving us room to experiment and rapidly perfect designs without being required to continually obtain new approvals for specific UAS vehicles."" Amazon wants minimal involvement from human pilots Misener also took issue with the recently proposed rules from the FAA that would govern commercial drone flight in the US. The agency wants all drones to have a human pilot and to stay within that person's line of sight at all times. A better system, he argued, ""must allow UAS applications to take advantage of a core capability of the technology: to fly with minimal human involvement, beyond visual line of sight."" This kind of flight might have been dangerous a few years ago, but ""automated UAS sense and avoid technology and on-board intelligence address these factors and will mitigate the related risks."" If the FAA proceeds with its current rules and timetable, Amazon believes it will fall far behind the rest of the world. Misener applauded new policies from the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), which treat drones as a new category of aircraft, instead of lumping them in with manned aircraft. Academic experts who study the drone industry agree that unless something changes, American companies will move the research and development of commercial drones overseas to take advantage of the more permissive environment. ""Innovators will have a clear path towards flying in Europe.""  ""Granted, the path to that future is a challenging technical problem, but what EASA has done is removed arbitrary regulatory hurdles, allowing engineers to do what they do best — design and innovate,"" wrote Gregory McNeal, an associate professor of law and public policy at Pepperdine. ""The new regulatory framework means that these innovators will have a clear path towards flying in Europe.   They can plan and design their products to address safety concerns, rather than plan around arbitrary rules based on the last century’s aviation technology."" Amazon reiterated its plan to employ a fleet of drones that would deliver packages in under half an hour to customers within a 10-mile radius. ""We are grateful for the FAA’s newly released [rules], so far as it goes. But it doesn’t go far enough,"" said Misener. ""Unlike the planning by the national and multinational groups with whom I met in Europe earlier this month, the FAA is not adequately addressing compelling UAS applications that involve highly automated operations beyond visual line of sight."" Misener stopped short of asking legislators to step in an propose new rules that would supersede the FAA, although he hinted the Congress could provide the agency with more ""impetus"".

The USA Freedom Act was created to rein in Section 215 of the Patriot Act, which had allowed the government to (among other things) collect huge swathes of phone records from companies like Verizon. A version of the USA Freedom Act was passed by the House of Representatives in May, but the Senate has been unable to pass it until now, one day after Section 215 expired. This time, the bill passed with a vote of 67 for to 32 against. The USA Freedom Act, proposed after Edward Snowden revealed the phone records program in a series of leaked documents, has had a difficult time making it through Congress. An earlier version passed the House, but not the Senate, and the latest iteration faced stiff opposition as Section 215's expiration approached. In fact, the Senate voted it down again last week. It was brought back after a simple extension of the Patriot Act provisions, proposed by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), failed. Glad the Senate finally passed the USA Freedom Act. It protects civil liberties and our national security. I'll sign it as soon as I get it. Today, McConnell introduced a series of amendments that would have loosened portions of the USA Freedom Act and delayed its implementation from six to 12 months, but all four were voted down before passage. He opposed the bill overall, claiming that the end of Section 215 in its current form was ""a resounding victory for those currently plotting attacks against the homeland."" However, others saw the USA Freedom Act as the only workable compromise. Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), an outspoken proponent of NSA surveillance powers, said it was ""the best opportunity to quickly get these programs back up and running."" The USA FREEDOM Act just passed Congress—the most powerful surveillance reform bill to become law in decades. @OTI statement coming shortly. On the other side of the aisle, reform advocate Ron Wyden (D-OR) called the USA Freedom Act's passage ""the most significant victory for Americans’ privacy rights in more than a decade."" Patrick Leahy (D-VT), a co-author of the bill, said that it was ""an accomplishment made possible by meaningful congressional oversight. It is about living up to our responsibility to ensure the privacy rights of all Americans."" It's not all positive, though. The ACLU notes that the USA Freedom Act's scope has been limited since the original bill was introduced. ""The bill leaves many of the government’s most intrusive and overbroad surveillance powers untouched, and it makes only very modest adjustments to disclosure and transparency requirements,"" said deputy legal director Jameel Jaffer. ""The passage of this bill is an indication that comprehensive reform is possible, but it is not comprehensive reform in itself."" The Electronic Frontier Foundation had also been critical of the bill, but issued a celebratory message after the bill passed.

""And we’re hoping that this could be a turning point in the fight to rein in the NSA."" Now that the bill is through Congress, it's all but certain that the USA Freedom Act will become law.

USA Today reports that the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) conducted 11,681 electronic intercepts in 2014, up from 3,394 just a decade earlier. This sharp increase has been made possible, USA Today reports, because the DEA has circumvented federal judges in favor of state courts that may have less rigorous requirements for obtaining warrants. A DEA spokesman told USA Today that the increase in wiretaps can be explained by ""the proliferation of communication devices and methods"" used by drug traffickers. Of course, it would be easy to substitute ""drug traffickers"" for ""terrorists,"" and the US commonly does — the DEA and NSA have shared talking points on the sophistication of their enemies when justifying broad surveillance measures.  It's no coincidence the war on terror looks like the war on drugs It's no coincidence that the war on terror and the war on drugs look very similar. Before government officials began linking poppy fields in Afghanistan to funding for terrorism after 9/11, and before the NSA began its aggressive metadata dragnet, the DEA ran a decades-long program capturing phone records for every call coming in and out of the US. Maybe it's no surprise, then, that the DEA and NSA problematically worked together after 9/11 to bust Americans for drug crimes. The phone dragnets took a hit this week when the Senate finally passed a surveillance reform bill, but the measure is just one cork in a very leaky boat. The Justice Department has been tracking millions of vehicles across the US as part of a DEA effort to build a national database of driver movements, and there are plenty of other ways to use existing legal authorities to spy on citizens without strong judicial review. While the DEA's state-authorized wiretaps may pass more constitutional muster than the kind of warrantless surveillance the agency pioneered in the 1990s, its behavior in seeking out state courts to bypass strict federal scrutiny fits a pattern of seeking dubious means to ""enforcement.""

It's a hacking competition: you try to break into their system while they try to break into yours. Just like regular Capture the Flag, there's offense and defense. If your offense is good, you might break through the enemy system before they know what you're up to. If you're a defensive player, you can stop the enemy intrusions early and learn from them, giving your offense a leg up. Of course, hackers are competitive — never more so than at Defcon — so the most important part is that by the end, you know who won and who lost. Michael Walker has helped design those games, even joined in them a few times. In 2013, he came to DARPA with a challenge: teach computers how to play. The result is DARPA's Cyber Grand Challenge, which begins its qualifying challenge today, testing entries from more than 100 teams. Each entry represents a different take on what such a program might look like. The basic task for each program is simple — find ways to break software — but there are almost endless ways a given piece of software might break. No one has ever built an automatic bug hunter for a practical purpose like this, and it's not clear how best to do it, or if it can be done at all. But by the time Defcon convenes next summer, Walker is aiming to have a full crop of those bug hunting programs, pitted against each other in gladiatorial capture-the-flag combat. The winner gets $2 million, with $1 million and $750,000 for the runners-up. ""It's never been done as an autonomous system."" DARPA has tried this model before, holding Grand Challenges for self-driving cars, humanoid robots, and drivetrain systems. In each case, the goal has been to take an idea with lots of theoretical research and tip it into the realm of the practical. To that, DARPA dangles a big cash prize and counts on lots of entries. The contest is open to anyone, with small shops and academic teams competing alongside major corporations. Some get funding assistance from DARPA, but others come at it from the outside, all generating as many different approaches to the problem as possible. In the case of the self-driving car, it worked. After some early false starts, Sebastian Thrun's Stanford team emerged as the hero of the late challenges and went on to form the core of Google's self-driving program. Walker's hope is that automated security research could be near a similar tipping point. ""Program analysis — software that studies other software — is right now where vehicle automation was then,"" Walker says. ""They can solve lots of interesting problems in the lab, but it's never been done under practical applications and it's never been done as an autonomous system."" Walker's goal is arguably even harder than the self-driving car. Instead of building software that can walk or steer, his entries will have to answer the fundamental question of security research: how might this code fail? It's a hard question, one that occupies an entire industry full of very smart people and still only manages to put a small dent in the many ways a program can fail. It can take years for a vulnerability to surface, even in widely used software like Windows. Once a researcher finds a vulnerability, building and applying the patch can take months. In high-profile cases like the Heartbleed vulnerability, the result is often a real scramble, as criminals rush to exploit the bug before admins have time to patch it. It can take years for a vulnerability to surface, and months more to patch it Bug-hunting software would act faster, potentially patching vulnerabilities as soon as it sees them being exploited. The Cyber Challenge is testing out the most elemental form of the idea, but if the test models become practical, it would be a pivotal change for the security profession, which currently assumes that any widely used software has vulnerabilities we don't know about. Computability theory dictates that the programs won't be able to find every vulnerability, but just outrunning human researchers and speeding up the patch cycle would be enough to fundamentally change the way software works. ""It is utterly disruptive to the way we think about computer security,"" Walker says. ""Right now we're worried about you clicking the wrong link, or knowing about that command and control server as a threat indicator, but we've given up on the software safety part of it. It's considered an unsolvable problem.""  ""It is utterly disruptive to the way we think about computer security."" For now, Walker is most concerned with showing the idea can work at all. The entries submitted today will be run against a suite of test software, with the best entries receiving funding from DARPA. The funded teams will compete against an open field in a series of challenges leading up to Defcon 2016, where the finalists will go head to head, using high-powered computers to show off their programs in front of a live audience. To test out the programs, Walker's team is providing a brand new binary executable format and 100 new pieces of software. Each one comes with a clear task and a clear success state; the attacker’s job is to make it fail. That means any vulnerabilities will be completely new and useless for attacks on existing software. As Walker put it, ""We needed a desert to play in."" The nature of Capture the Flag means that the programs will only compete against each other, so it will be easy for later generations of software to adapt and improve. Most importantly, if DARPA wants to put a program head to head against a human some day for a Deep Blue versus Kasparov moment, we'll know exactly how to do it. But for now, the big question isn't who will win, but if anyone can prove out the idea itself. Even that may be harder than it looks. In the case of self-driving cars, the first challenge was disastrous: none of the cars made it even a 10th of the way through the desert route and the $1 million prize went unclaimed. Just over a decade later, it's one of the most sought-after projects in tech. In the end, the first round of projects may not be the best way to judge. ""What happens after an initial prototyping contest where we go from impossible to possible? Universally what happens is, everybody tears everything down and starts over,"" Walker says. ""This is how technology development works.""",0.6332633728090158,0.3667366271909842,0.8469056268499101,1106,4.7775768535262202,539,5.9276437847866417,0,0,"Tech, US & World, Report"

Without legal authorization, the NSA was forced to shut down bulk collection just before 8PM that night. Now, with the USA Freedom Act signed into law, assuring the eventual shutdown of the program, it's unexpectedly coming back online. The Guardian is reporting that, after the brief hiatus imposed by Congress, the NSA is gearing up to bring the call records collection system back online. It's possible because of a provision in the USA Freedom Act which gives the agency six months before it needs to get rid of the program entirely. The bill was drafted with the assumption that USA Freedom would pass before the Patriot Act expired, so the six-month extension was included to give the NSA time to prepare. No one expected that, having shut down the program in the interim, the NSA would use that provision as an excuse to start it up again. The restarted collection is only temporary. The NSA is still legally obligated to shut down the program in December, and it's unlikely that Congress or the president will do anything to extend that deadline.

Having come out ahead of Google's YouTube and other video services that reportedly vied for the honor, Yahoo will broadcast the October 25th International Series game between the Buffalo Bills and Jacksonville Jaguars from London's Wembley Stadium. Unless you live in either team's home market, Yahoo will be your one and only option for watching the Week 7 game. Recode reports that Yahoo paid at least $20 million to land the exclusive deal. The stream will be available across desktop, smartphones, set-top boxes, and smart TVs, and all of Yahoo's biggest properties (Yahoo.com, Yahoo Sports, and Tumblr) will be pointing users to it on game day. You choose how to watch the stream: it'll be accessible by web and also through the company's video-focused apps like Yahoo Screen. Kickoff is scheduled for 9:30AM ET in the United States, which could lead to smaller ratings than your typical Sunday afternoon game. And yes, there will be ads. Yahoo sees this as a big opportunity to flex its advertising muscle and attract big-name sponsors, and from that perspective you should expect the game to resemble most TV broadcasts in the amount of ads you'll see on screen through four quarters. Both Yahoo and the NFL plan to market this as a monumental moment for the league — because it is. This is one game you won't see on cable  A promotional image for the NFL's October 25th International Series game TV networks have been live-streaming the Super Bowl to web viewers for several years now, but this marks the first time the NFL itself is taking the plunge and, for one day only, shutting cable partners out of the mix. Realistically speaking, networks like CBS and FOX don't need to worry about losing America's biggest sport to Yahoo, YouTube, or anyone else for many years; they've got rights for Sunday games locked up through 2022. Similarly, ESPN's Monday Night Football is also guaranteed to be a weekly ritual for at least seven more years. If anything, Thursday Night Football presents the best opportunity for streaming services to get into the game. NFL Network airs eight of those games each season, with CBS getting the other half. That arrangement will carry through 2015, but what happens after this year is less certain. But football isn't leaving your TV For right now, the International Series presented a unique opportunity for the NFL to make history, even if it's a one-off. ""We’ve had national windows before, but not necessarily a global window,"" said Vishal Shah, the NFL's VP of digital media business development. According to Shah, fans shouldn't notice any difference between this and any other regular season game when it comes to polish and presentation. ""It will look and feel and be delivered to the fans traditionally as a high-quality production would go. The talent, the storylines, the knowledge base of both the commentators and the ability to access information are going to be there."" CBS is handling production duties for the football end of things, with Yahoo obviously focused on streaming and promotion. Over a billion people visit Yahoo's various properties each month — with half of those visits from mobile devices. ""The expectation is that just given the breadth of the reach and the breadth of the distribution, this really has the potential of being one of the leading live-streaming events that has been delivered via the internet,"" said Shah. It's a regular season NFL game, after all. People will be watching — even at 9:30 in the morning. Yahoo views itself as the NFL's ideal match for numerous reasons. First, it's got enormous global reach as Shah mentioned. Second, it's capable of putting content on just about any platform or device. And third, it's already got a strong connection with sports fans thanks to Yahoo Sports and a massively popular fantasy sports platform with over 16 million loyal users. But even then, the company had to compete for the October 25th game. Yahoo's Adam Cahan told The Verge that the NFL's plan to stream a game worldwide, which was first outlined last year, attracted ""active participation by a number of different players."" Other sources familiar with the process said that the Silicon Valley mainstays you'd expect were all eager for a chance to be the NFL's link between Wembley and internet users. If YouTube executives are throwing chairs somewhere, the mood is definitely far more celebratory at Yahoo's headquarters. A huge win for Marissa Mayer's Yahoo ""From our perspective, it’s a really historic event in the sense that it’s the opportunity to bring what is probably the most premier, exclusive content to users for free and really provide an ultimate football experience in that regard,"" said Cahan, Yahoo's SVP of product and engineering, video, design, and emerging products. ""We definitely see this as a historic step in a broader shift,"" he added. ""It’s a very different approach than the NFL has taken in the past. You don’t need any authentication, no cable, none of that. And that’s really exciting to be part of."" Yahoo is also very confident that it'll have no problems broadcasting a reliable stream to a global audience. Streaming other massive events like the Royal Wedding, Michael Jackson's funeral, and concerts from Taylor Swift and Dave Matthews have helped the company bolster its native video capabilities. So after the last whistle is blown, how will the NFL decide whether this over-the-top experiment was a success or failure? ""There’s no distinct metric, but for us, our goal and our aspiration is to be one of the leading live events streamed globally,"" said Shah. ""We have very high expectations."" Once the NFL season gets underway, the October 25th event will be hard to ignore. Both the NFL and Yahoo plan to promote it constantly, and Cahan said it will be featured front and center on Yahoo's prized home page when the big day rolls around.

And yet, it all feels remarkably fresh. There's no third Fantastic Four reboot: these are new takes on westerns, old characters neatly updated for 2015, and some great footage you've never seen. There are 13 trailers below.   Throw eight Quentin Tarantino characters into a room, wait a couple days, and see who walks out. That seems to be the premise of Tarantino's latest, The Hateful Eight. This trailer is more about showing its cool side than its actual tone, but having seen more footage at Comic-Con last month, I can tell you that you'll definitely want to see more. It's out starting on Christmas.   I think this trailer is trying to make Doctor Who look very rock and roll, and it is either wildly succeeding or miserably failing depending on how much you already like BBC programing. Either way, Doctor Who's new season is bringing back everything fans could ask for, it has a guest appearance from Maisie Williams this year, and it starts September 19th.   CBS's Supergirl looks campy in all the right ways. It's a superhero show for people who love CW series more than Zack Snyder's Man of Steel, and that's kind of wonderful. We need more variety when it comes to how these classic characters as presented. It starts on CBS October 26th.   Jem and the Holograms certainly isn't sticking close to its source material. But maybe it doesn't matter: the reboot is trying to become a story of fame and identity in the internet age, and the series' broader conceits might just help it get there. Plus, there's a weird little robot! It's out October 23rd.   Imagine if someone threw Blade Runner, The Matrix, and Deadwood into a blender and then gave you a shot of whatever freaky goo came out. That's kind of what watching this trailer is like. Westworld is a new series coming to HBO next year that stars Anthony Hopkins and is based on a film from Michael Crichton. It's about reality, or something. It looks cool.   Christopher Nolan’s next movie is a… short documentary? Nolan's short film Quay heads into the Quay Brothers' eerie stop-motion animation studio. The film is being toured around the US, and it'll be playing along with four shorts that the brothers have made over the past three decades. If you've never seen their gorgeously creepy work before, definitely check it out above. The film begins playing in New York next week.   At the very least, this movie seems like a wonderful excuse to watch Bryan Cranston do some wonderful acting. Plus, there's Helen Mirren, John Goodman, and Louis C.K., too. The film is about a blacklisted Hollywood screenwriter amid 1940s communism scares, and it comes out this November.   Life has Robert Pattinson playing a photographer looking into a hot new actor named James Dean. This first trailer is pretty toned down, but it's worth paying attention to: it comes from director Anton Corbijn, who's made some great films like The American. Life comes out on September 26th in the UK.   In 1972, director Sydney Pollack recorded over 20 hours of footage documenting Aretha Franklin as she recorded the album Amazing Grace. By all means, that's something that a lot of people would love to see, but the footage was apparently locked up for one reason or another until recently. Now it's finally been edited together into a documentary, which is premiering this year at the Toronto International Film Festival. That means it'll likely be released widely in late 2015 or early 2016.   I'd watch this just for the amazing landscapes and baby wolves. Wolf Totem is about nomads in 1960s China who are facing down the elements — and wolves — all while students from Beijing are moving in and trying to teach their kids. It's based on a novel that came out about a decade ago; the film comes out on September 11th.   I have, like, no idea what's happening here. This trailer is 20 percent James Bond, 20 percent food porn, 20 percent cutesy romance, 20 percent Gordon Ramsay, and 20 percent Bradley Cooper just being too aww-shucks cute to dislike. But here's what it's really worth watching for: a really wonderful use of sound. Noises of the kitchen build and build until they're one overbearing rhythm that sets the tone for the trailer's darker points. Who knows what the film is going to be like, but it'll be out October 23rd.   Red Band trailers are supposed to be all edgy and cool, but this one really just drives home how often they reveal a movie's worst sensibilities. The first trailer for Sleeping With Other People made it seem like a surprisingly thoughtful sex comedy, but this trailer makes it seem more like it errs toward the gross-out extremes that people love to see from Seth Rogen films. I guess that's all fine and well if that's what you're into, but I have to wonder if making a movie that doesn't need a Red Band trailer is sometimes the smarter move. The film comes out on September 11th.   Pros: a very serious Paul Giamatti. Cons: in comparison, probably everything else. It starts on Showtime January 17th.",0.6327080970898321,0.3672919029101679,0.17625429911852541,915,4.6185792349726773,508,5.6614173228346454,0,0,"Culture, Entertainment, Film"

The image makes no sense outside its intended meme-iness. The editors at Time are partly responsible for the humiliating depiction of the promising technology. But the Oculus — and VR — also brought some of the backlash upon themselves.   VR is a little ostracizing.  When you put on a headset, which covers your eyes and ears, you are letting those around you know, ""I am disconnecting from the outside world."" That can be off-putting. I think that's why, in some part, VR has been the butt of jokes for decades.

The first-person, multiplayer thriller takes place in a post-apocalyptic version of the year 3000, one where players compete for a mysterious object known as the ""light artifact."" As you battle you can, like in most games, die. But each death brings The Flock closer to its ultimate conclusion. Dutch studio Vogelsap has set a counter, and once the in-game death toll reaches 215,358,979, new players won’t be able to purchase the game, and the story for those who are playing will move into the final phase.  ""A tragic race doomed to extinction."" According to Jeroen Van Hasselt, creative director at Vogelsap, the unique set-up was designed to help get around the challenge of telling a story in a multiplayer game — in particular the ending. You’ll play as one of the Flock, ""a hideous race of skeletal beasts"" that have risen up after humanity’s extinction. ""We always had this story; the Flock are a tragic race doomed to extinction,"" says Van Hasselt. ""During development we had several ideas how to convey that story into multiplayer. It was only when we tried to come up with a solution for a multiplayer game's often anticlimactic ending that both ideas clicked. That’s how the population idea came to life."" The seemingly random population number was created by a combination of factors, including the story and the studio taking into consideration just how many players may end up playing. The goal was to make the game last for a reasonable amount of time, but not drag on until players lose interest. ""By our own estimations the game will probably last roughly a year, but we really don’t know,"" admits Van Hasselt. ""We leave it up to the players, as it’s their battle and adventure. Safe to say, the number is substantial and we don’t expect it to end in mere months."" The studio has said that it won’t add to the population count unless the game — which is due to launch on PC on August 21st — makes its way to additional platforms, like the Xbox One or PlayStation 4.   If nothing else, the scheme feels like a clever way to get around one of the biggest problems with multiplayer-focused games: few of them last for very long. For every Destiny or World of Warcraft, there’s a mountain of failed RPGs or shooters that couldn’t muster a large enough audience to stay interesting for more than a few months. There’s a good chance that The Flock, a relatively unknown game from a small studio, would suffer a similar fate. ""So we decided to sacrifice the ability to play the game in a few years’ time, because we think those players wouldn’t be getting a very good experience anyway,"" Van Hasselt says. ""Either there will be no one online to play against or just a bunch of players who are either very good or very bad.

Entertainment Weekly reports that the comics company now plans on launching a new title this fall that doesn't star an already popular white superhero. Titled Moon-Girl and Devil Dinosaur, the series will feature the adventures of pre-teen genius Lunella Lafayette and friend that happens to be a 30-foot dinosaur. The concept for Moon-Girl and Devil Dinosaur actually draws from the short-lived Devil Dinosaur comic, penned by Jack Kirby in 1978. The original series followed the exploits of the super-intelligent Devil Dinosaur and his caveman pal Moon-Boy on Dinosaur World, a parallel Earth where dinosaurs roamed the planet. The new comic, helmed by writers Amy Reeder and Brandon Montclare, artist Natacha Bustos, and editors Mark Paniccia and Emily Shaw, takes the title and concept and updates it for modern-day New York City — though there may be a handful of references to the original series along the way. An original character created with diversity in mind ""Brandon and I were talking about co-writing books with Marvel,"" Reeder told EW, ""and we were really interested in doing something that would be a lot of fun, and that gravitated towards something that wasn’t made yet or wasn’t a main character or popular character for awhile. I like that idea because you get to do a lot with those types of situations. You get to put a lot of creativity into it, and have your voice heard. You’re not quite tied in to all the events. So that’s something that attracted us."" Much of the series, which will reportedly have a Pixar feel, will focus on Lunella's being special but wanting to fit in, which will be difficult with a red dinosaur running around. She joins the likes of Kamala Khan and Miles Morales as another superhero of color starring in her own book. (She also, at least on the surface, resembles Gertrude Yorkes from popular series Runaways.) However, this certainly doesn't mean Marvel hasn't struggled with diversity. In addition to weathering criticism for its treatment of Black Widow in Avengers: Age of Ultron and both Wasps in Ant-Man, the company recently came under fire for to its decision to make Hercules straight as opposed to bisexual. All this is to say that there's plenty of work that needs to be done, both at Marvel and in comics in general.

Its millions of players will tell you, however, that it's actually about the endless quest for Gjallarhorn, an exotic rocket launcher that far outstrips anything else in the game in terms of power. Gjallarhorn has a perk called ""wolfpack rounds,"" which are homing missiles that burst out of the rocket upon its already-devastating initial impact and continue to track targets, which is exactly as useful as it sounds. Basically, if you want to end the game's sometimes interminable boss fights as quickly as possible, you're going to want a Gjallarhorn. The only problem is, it's very hard to find for most players, with a low chance of dropping at the end of high-level activities.  You have 48 hours to earn 17 strange coins Well, good news: now you can just buy one from a dude with weird tentacles for a face. Xûr, the exotic item vendor who shows up in the Tower for 48 hours at this time every week, is selling Gjallarhorn for the first time since the week after Destiny went on sale — a time when almost no one had any idea of the weapon's essential nature. You'll need 17 Strange Coins to pick it up; these can be earned through activities like the weekly heroic strike, the Prison of Elders, and so on. You have until 5AM ET on Sunday morning to get them. I have personally played Destiny for something like 160 hours without ever coming across a Gjallarhorn, so I'm buying three.

According to The New York Times, the show's nonprofit parent group Sesame Workshop has struck a deal with HBO to host its next five seasons starting this fall. The new deal will allow the workshop to product 35 episodes a year, almost twice as many as it currently makes. It also accommodates two upcoming spinoff series, one of which is an original educational property ostensibly separate from the world of the Muppets. Sesame Street's move to HBO doesn't mean a complete loss for PBS. The show's new seasons will be available exclusively on HBO for nine months before returning to their traditional home on PBS, and HBO has also purchased the license for over 150 old episodes of Sesame Street. In the near-year between a new episode's premiere and its PBS availability, the network will air reconfigured episodes from the last several seasons to fill the programming gap. HBO has to compete with Netflix's Dinotrux armada Acquiring Sesame Street is a major boon for HBO's children's programming. That phrase would've been oxymoronic even a year ago given the network's reputation for violence and ""sexposition,"" but it's becoming a necessary part of every network and TV service's toolbox in a post-cable world. If HBO is going to compete with Netflix's armada of Dinotrux and Adam Sandler movies, it has to diversify its portfolio and appeal to a wider audience. A subscriber is a subscriber, whether they're tuning in for Show Me a Hero or Sesame Street. With that said, there's still something unsettling about the premium absorption of one of public television's longest-tenured and most beloved shows, especially when it has to do with waning business and broader market shifts. ""I’ve long admired the creative work of HBO and can’t think of a better partner to continue the quality of Sesame Street’s programming,"" said Sesame Street co-founder Joan Ganz Cooney. ""The economics of the children’s television production business have changed dramatically... Sesame Workshop must recognize these changes and adapt to the times.""

Watching a spidery mechanical creature struggle to keep going after losing a limb feels like watching a wounded animal, with one big difference: the animal has had a whole life to figure out how to adapt to an injury, not to mention millions of years of evolution. The robot might not have any experience at all. That's the problem that Sorbonne University researcher Jean-Baptiste Mouret and a team of fellow scientists are trying to solve. In this week's issue of Nature, the group lays out an algorithm that could potentially help robots compensate for injury faster and more consistently. ""It's quite intuitive for us humans to say 'if something is broken, first I want some kind of diagnosis to know what's wrong, and then we will try to find a solution for it,'"" says Mouret. Sometimes this takes the form of set patterns written by humans, and sometimes robots can figure it out on their own. Researchers at Cornell University, for example, developed a four-legged ""starfish"" robot that could identify parts of its own body and adapt to changes accordingly. Mouret's team, though, thinks robots could adapt simply through trial and error, without having to understand what's wrong first — the way someone might start limping without knowing whether they've got a sprain or a fracture. And they think that by ""teaching"" the robot about what its own body can do first, they can help it draw on past knowledge to do so. ""It doesn't understand what is broken. It just knows that something is not as expected."" For this study, once the team built and programmed a robot, the algorithm catalogued its potential range of behavior — every way that the robot could conceivably move — and identified the best options. It's ""a bit like a child who is trying many different things with its own body, just to know itself,"" says Mouret. By the time it was sent into the field, the robot had a set of basic intuitions based on its undamaged body. After getting hurt, it could use that knowledge as a jumping-off point to test new options. ""These intuitions are wrong most of the time,"" says Mouret. ""The robot does not trust them, but says 'let's try this thing, because we have intuition that that might work.'"" Once it's started this process, the robot uses a mathematical model called Bayesian optimization to find a new strategy. A robot, for example, might begin by realizing that its normal walking style is now sending it in circles — researchers have deactivated one of the legs. It checks its existing knowledge base of around 13,000 gaits, picks a likely solution, and tests it, while the sensors measure its speed and direction. Then it moves on to the next option, balancing its ""intuition"" with more random choices that could reveal a new path. Once it's 90 percent confident that it's found the fastest and straightest option, it gets back to work. ""It doesn't understand what is broken. It just knows that something is not as expected and then tries to find something that works in spite of the damage,"" says Mouret. The team tested this algorithm on two robots: a six-legged walking bot and a multi-jointed, rotating arm that was attempting to drop a ping-pong ball into a cup. They tested five different ways of breaking the hexapod, including partially severing one leg, completely removing two, and attempting a makeshift repair. After being run through each scenario 40 times, the it generally took about a minute to adapt to a new gait. The robotic arm, meanwhile, had individual joints either broken or stuck in place; it adapted consistently in under two minutes and usually under 30 seconds.  A damaged hexapod (Antoine Cully / UPMC). The model has limits, though. For two of the 14 mechanical arm errors they tested, for example, the team's algorithm didn't perform any better than traditional, non-""intuitive"" trial and error. The team hypothesizes that if the damage is bad enough, the robot's body can change so much that its previous knowledge becomes useless. Likewise, if a robot's sensors — not just its appendages — are damaged, it won't be able to get enough accurate information to adapt at all. And right now, it only responds to fairly simple goals. When humans and animals limp, for example, they're not just trying to find a new way to walk, they're avoiding hurting themselves any further. There's no equivalent to that for robots; they're just looking to be faster or more accurate. ""It's very difficult to imagine how blind the robots are,"" says Mouret. ""We have skin, we have all of our internal organs, all of these things are sending sensory information. But robots usually have just a few sensors."" Partly because of this, the robots Mouret and his team are testing also barely know anything about what's going on outside their own bodies. So if they're on uneven ground, or in a small space, they can't factor that into their trial and error. The next step is to rectify this, testing more complicated robots with a wider range of motion and more ways of looking at the world. ""It's very difficult to imagine how blind the robots are."" Overall, Mouret believes that this system could be adapted easily to existing robots, particularly advanced humanoid ones like the competitors in DARPA's Robotics Challenge. ""All these robots are very versatile,"" he says. If one part breaks, they've got a lot of ways to compensate, just like humans or animals. The more stripped-down and specific a machine gets, the less useful the algorithm becomes. ""If you take a Roomba — the vacuum cleaner — this robot has only two wheels. So if one wheel is broken, maybe it can do something. If two are broken, it cannot do anything,"" says Mouret. ""So it could be used, but it would not be that interesting."" Of course, it can be just as important for fairly inflexible systems like jet aircraft to respond to damage. Researchers at NASA, for example, are testing a flight control system with its own intelligent adaptive system. In theory, helping robots figure out what they can do and then telling them to achieve a specific goal could have applications beyond adapting to injuries. An undamaged walking robot, for example, could use the algorithm to figure out how to traverse difficult terrain. But these are secondary options. ""I think engineers are very good at their jobs. So when we try to optimize something and make it work or make a better robot, they usually have very good ideas,"" says Mouret. Engineers just can't predict everything that might go wrong with their creations. ""This kind of algorithm could be used to optimize robots and to make them perform better. But I think it's much more useful when nobody is around.""",0.17924190905211596,0.820758090947884,0.6690030883549823,1164,4.8505154639175254,561,6.0516934046345812,0,2,"Science, Report"

The act already protects navigable waterways, but today's rule extends it to cover additional tributaries and nearby bodies that may feed into downstream waters. Anyone planning to pollute or destroy those waters will now have to obtain a permit from the Environmental Protection Agency, which jointly proposed these rules along with the US Army. ""Too many of our waters have been left vulnerable to pollution."" The changes, known as the Clean Water Rule, are controversial in some circles, which see it as devaluing land and forcing farmers to jump through unnecessary hoops. But the government says its intention isn't to regulate waters that have never before been covered — it's just to regulate waters that were once covered under the act but later lost coverage due to legal ambiguity and new interpretations of the law. Two Supreme Court cases in the 2000s narrowed the act's scope, removing protections from bodies of water that had previously been included. ""Court decisions have led to uncertainty and a need for clarification,"" President Obama says in a statement. ""Too many of our waters have been left vulnerable to pollution."" These rules are meant to begin protecting some of those waters once again.

A new hominin species that likely lived at the same time as the ""Lucy"" species in Ethiopia is described in a study published in Nature today. The species would have lived between 3.3 and 3.5 million years ago — a timestamp that further muddles human evolution, while also lending support to the idea that numerous hominins co-existed during the middle Pliocene. We don’t know if the Lucy species gave rise to modern humans Up until recently, human evolution was viewed as a fairly simple tree. Sure, it had a number of branches up at the top, but its trunk was basically one straight line, researchers thought. But with the discovery of Kenyanthropus platyops in 1999, and now with this new hominin species, that idea has had to evolve as well. The truth is that we don’t know if the Lucy species that was discovered in 1974 gave rise to modern humans. ""The complexity of human evolution — species emerging and all that — extends further back in time"" than researchers previously thought, says Fred Spoor, a human paleontologist at University College London who helped describe Kenyanthropus platyops and who didn’t take part in this new study.    Credit: Yohannes Haile-Selassie  In the study, researchers analysed jawbones and teeth that were found in Ethiopia in 2011,   about 22 miles from where fossils belonging to ""Lucy"" species, Australopithecus afarensis, have been found. Although the size and the shape of the new hominin resemble that of afarensis, the researchers argue that some of the features are very distinct from it. And so, the researchers named the new hominin Australopithecus deyiremeda. ""Deyiremeda"" is a mish-mash of words from the region that mean ""close relative."" Lucy and deyiremeda ""were living next door to each other."" ""With this discovery we confirm that there were multiple hominin species during the middle Pliocene,"" explains Yohannes Haile-Selassie, a paleoanthropologist at the Cleveland Museum of Natural History and a co-author of the study. ""We also show that A. deyiremeda and A. afarensis were living next door to each other."" The researchers make a good case for a new species, Spoor says. But there's still a chance that this fossil belongs to the Lucy species. Males and females can be very different, and the variation seen in this specimen could play into that somehow, Spoor says. ""They give good reasons for why it’s a different species, but I will only completely agree with it when I see it myself.""  Early human ancestors were diverse No one knows what deyiremeda looked like, or how it behaved. The only thing we know for sure is that these hominins were different from modern humans in terms of their facial morphology, size of their teeth, and most likely their brain capacity. Researchers also aren’t sure whether the Lucy species and deyiremeda ever interacted. ""These questions are difficult to answer because the fossils don't tell us anything about them,"" Haile-Selassie says. Still, both Spoor and Haile-Selassie think that it’s possible that they co-existed. And if they did, they may have avoided each other, Haile-Selassie says — ""if only to avoid extinction."" ""There is still a lot more to learn about our evolution,""  Haile-Selassie says. ""Early human ancestors were as diverse as other animals in the past and in the present."" Discovering new species like this one means that scientists will eventually have to figure out which one of those middle Pliocene hominins is the ancestor of our genus Homo. ""When A. afarensis was the only known species from the middle Pliocene, it was the only candidate to be the ancestor,"" Haile-Selassie says. Now, we have at least three candidates.

It launched on May 20th, carrying many researchers' dreams of solar propulsion with it. It's an ambitious project; the scientists behind it want to demonstrate that solar propulsion can help spaceships get around without having to carry boosters or fuel reserves. But a problem with an onboard data file has crashed LightSail's avionics system, removing its ability to communicate with Earth, reports The Washington Post. This essentially means that LightSail's computer is completely frozen. There is some hope left, however. If LightSail collides with stray charged particles, it's possible that the ""hit"" could provoke a reboot. These types of ""natural reboots"" aren't uncommon, according to The Planetary Society, so it's still a possibility. And in its current form, LightSail can remain in orbit for about six months.

""A running jump is a truly dynamic behavior,"" said Sangbae Kim, an assistant professor of mechanical engineering at MIT, in a press release. ""You have to manage balance and energy, and be able to handle impact after landing. Our robot is specifically designed for those highly dynamic behaviors.""  Robo track and field, here we come. (MIT) To create Cheetah's new jumping ability, researchers installed LIDAR on the robot to map out its surrounding terrain. (These are the same sensors used by self-driving cars — they bounce laser pulses off their surroundings and record the time they take to return to the source to estimate distances.) Then, they designed a trio of algorithms: the first detects an obstacle and estimates its size and distance; the second determines where Cheetah's feet need to be to at the start of its jump, adjusting the robot's stride to get there at the right time; and finally, the third calculates the amount of force needed to clear the obstacle. Kim explains that it's possible to optimize these algorithms for energy efficiency so that the robot just clears the obstacle, but this is dangerous. ""We’re too obsessed with optimal solutions,"" says Kim.

And while that technical feat is impressive, what's more important is what the study in Science suggests: in some cases, memories that are lost due to brain trauma may still be present in the human brain.  The kind of memories that are often never recovered Amnesia comes in many forms. In some cases, people have trouble forming memories after sustaining a brain injury; others are unable to recall the events that led up to a brain injury. The latter is called ""retrograde amnesia,"" and it’s this particular form of memory loss that the researchers looked into. They wanted to see if they could retrieve lost memories — the kind that are often never recovered. To do this, researchers at MIT trained two groups of mice to associate a mild electrical shock to the foot with a specific environment, called Chamber A. The foot shock caused the mice to freeze in fear; eventually, just placing the mice in Chamber A triggered this response without the shock. During this training phase, the researchers also identified which neurons — in this case, cells in the brain that the researchers call ""memory engram cells"" — were active while the mice learned to fear Chamber A. The scientists labeled these cells with a protein that's sensitive to blue light, smuggled into the cells using a virus designed to seek them out. When the researchers shined a blue light on the engram cells, they activated the memory — causing the mice to freeze again, even though they were in a neutral environment. This use of blue light to activate certain cells is called ""optogenetics."" It’s the same technique that was used a few years, by the same group of researchers, to implant false memories in mice. But using it to recover a memory that had already been formed is completely new. ""We can still retrieve the memory by directly activating it in the brain."" Here's how the scientists did it. Once the two groups of mice were adequately trained, the researchers injected one group with a drug called anisomycin —  a drug that inhibits memory formation. The second group was injected with a saline solution. Then, the researchers returned both groups to Chamber A. ""The guys that got the drug didn’t freeze to the training context — they're weren’t afraid of it,"" explains Tomas Ryan, a neuroscientist at MIT and a co-author of the study. The mice that got the saline, on the other hand, kept freezing in Chamber A. At this point, the researchers were certain that the mice in the first group were displaying retrograde amnesia; they had lost the memory of the training. So, the scientist decided to activate the neurons once more, using blue light. Remarkably, it worked. The amnesiac mice froze in a neutral environment, just as they had before. And the memory that returned in these mice was as strong as the one in the saline-treated mice. The memory that’s lost because of retrograde amnesia isn’t destroyed in the mice. ""We can still retrieve the memory by directly activating it in the brain,"" Ryan says — an idea that has never been demonstrated experimentally in animals before. ""I can't think of what they could have improved,"" says Yave Lozano, a neuroscientist at University College London. Nonetheless, the work showed that it's possible to ""reactivate the fear memory that had been blocked."" The researchers didn’t stop there. The wanted to find out why the mice had been able to retrieve the memory. So the scientists went back to the engram cells. By looking at brains of trained mice, they found that the connections between the engram cells in the hippocampus — a seahorse-shaped brain region that's associated with memory — had been strengthened thanks to the training and the labeling of the cells. That made the memory far easier to retrieve after light activation.   Engram cells create a network across multiple brain areas Still, this didn't explain where the memory had been stored in the meantime. The researchers began to wonder if it might be encoded in the way their targeted cells interacted, Ryan says. They guessed that engram cells might create a network that’s distributed throughout many brain areas, so they started to look beyond the region of the brain that they had labelled. Eventually, their search lead them to figure out that the engram cells in one part of the hippocampus were strongly connected to another part of the hippocampus, and it was this pattern of connectivity that survived the drug treatment. When they extended the search further, they realized that other regions of the brain, including the amygdala, where where fear-based memories can be found, were also involved in this network. The researchers were therefore able to retrieve the memories because other connections in the brain — connections that were unaffected by the drug, but inaccessible without the light treatment — were storing information related to the shock treatment as well. ""So what we think is that when we're activating engram cells, we're able to activate a whole engram circuit,"" Ryan says. The drug used to cause amnesia severs the circuit somehow. But with blue light, the researchers can give the circuit a powerful kick that reactivates it and makes the memory accessible once more. The blue light gives the memory circuit a powerful kick ""We have strong reason now to believe that memory storage — that is, the storage of the memory information itself — is encoded through connectivity patterns of engram cells throughout the brain,"" Ryan says. If the finding holds up in future studies, it's bound to have a large impact on memory research going forward. But this work isn't going to help people who suffer from retrograde amnesia or Alzheimer's disease any time soon. ""It's very difficult to be doing this in humans, partly for the ethical reasons — the work is invasive — but also because we tag the memories in the brain before they're learned,"" Ryan says. This means that if the researchers wanted to help someone recover a memory, they would have to be present when the memory was formed. That isn't to say that this isn't useful information. The study provides important information regarding the mechanisms behind retrograde amnesia — and perhaps even a bit of hope for those who suffer from it. ""If you have had significant retrograde amnesia for a particular event due to brain trauma, it's quite possible that those memories are still present,"" Ryan says. What that means is that scientists can begin asking a new question: how to find them.",0.787459101836091,0.21254089816390898,0.34687889062179855,1138,4.9261862917398949,470,6.1148936170212762,0,0,"Science, Report"

Retraction Watch reported last week that researchers at the University of California-Berkeley — researchers who were initially impressed by the work — had noted irregularities in some of the survey data cited in the study.

The system, known as eCall, automatically contacts emergency services in the event of a crash, as determined by in-car sensors, such as those triggering the vehicle’s airbags. eCall establishes an audio connection with emergency operators and automatically transmits basic data including the vehicle's type, location, and the time of the crash. Passengers and witnesses will also be able to activate eCall manually by pressing an in-car button. eCall transmits data when a car's airbags are triggered ""The European Parliament has repeatedly stressed that reducing deaths and the severity of injuries on the roads is its priority,"" said Czech MEP Olga Sehnalova, the legislation's lead negotiator, in a statement. She added that the system will be ""a public service, free of charge for all citizens, irrespective of the type of vehicle or its purchase price."" Installing eCall is estimated to cost manufacturers €100 ($109) per car, although drivers wanting to retrofit it could expect to pay more. Sehnalova stressed that eCall will be completely dormant until the moment a crash occurs, telling BBC News that data is only transmitted once a car's airbags are triggered. Last year, there were 25,700 fatalities on EU roads and motorways. eCall is expected to reduce emergency response time by 40 percent in built-up areas and 50 percent in the country, and it's believed the system could save as many as 2,500 lives each year. Sehnalova said eCall would also benefit tourists in the EU, because ""when you cross a border you have a language problem and often do not even really know where you are."" The vehicle's location is established using satellite navigation systems such as Galileo — the European equivalent of GPS. Despite the potential benefits of eCall, some EU member states have objected to making it compulsory for all manufacturers. ""The benefit of making eCall mandatory in all new cars does not justify the cost of implementing it,"" said Claire Perry, the UK's former transport minister, last December.

It was the “School Series,” a competition where students build electric kit cars and get to race them against each other. The series is run in UK by the Greenpower Education Trust, where they have over 8,000 students from 500 schools building and racing these tiny electric cars every year. ""Formula E approached us about the School Series, it seemed like a natural progression for us to grow the profile of Greenpower,"" says Jeremy Way, the company’s CEO. Greenpower signed a five-race deal with Formula E to function as its supporting series, bringing its tech-club-meets-EV-racing to new places like Buenos Aires, Berlin, and the US. And while it's not going to feed promising young drivers into Formula E, it's a great way to help kids care more about electric vehicles. Like most student engineering competitions, it exists to encourage and promote STEM education. In fact, the series was started after a 1998 study found a decline in the number of young people in the UK entering the engineering workforce. The drivers and their crews are all in their teens, and come from high schools and charter schools local to each race — these aren’t Andrettis and Earnhardts. In Miami, almost all of them were in some sort of technology or robotics club, but many of them had never raced anything at all — at least not in the real world.

She’s beaten her friends time and time again on Rainbow Road, but she had never competed against anyone on pavement or asphalt. She didn’t even have a driver’s permit.   That was the consensus of the boys and girls who raced in Miami, who, despite their inexperience, were somehow totally unfazed about driving on the same course as the racing veterans of Formula E. The 10 teams received kits about five weeks before the event and were given one set of instructions: use all the parts provided with no modifications. That included an electric motor; a handful of small, 50-pound batteries; a thin, metal body frame; and some rubber wheels. Fully completed, the cars look more like they belong in some sort of futuristic soap box derby thanks to their large, solid rims and sleek chassis.  While we often hear in the US that our students are falling behind in fields like science, technology, and math, Way says he was surprised at how quickly the kids in Miami took to the cars. ""The [US] students seem very technically capable compared to UK students of the same age,"" he says. ""They are much more technically aware, which is really nice to see."" It was up to the teams to find a place to practice, too. The Inlet Grove team used their school’s bus depot (Kennedy apparently almost drove under one while practicing: ""It was a close call,"" she says). Another team told stories about weaving in between joggers on their school’s rubber running track. The cars top out at about 30mph under their own power (though one student in Miami claimed he broke 40 on the hill next to the American Airlines Arena), and it took them almost four minutes to complete the circuit. (The 270-horsepower Formula E cars made that same circuit in closer to a minute.) The racing was still exciting, though — a few students battled hard the entire 20-minute race, and the crowd thanked them with a roar every time they passed the grandstands. While the students were discouraged from getting too aggressive, two drivers came together late in the race. One was squeezed hard enough into the wall that his car lost a wheel; the unlucky student pulled the limping car off the course, unable to finish the race. He was quick to show his frustration with a muffled shout from beneath his helmet: ""He’s not supposed to do that!"" The closest track worker took the chance to teach him a lesson that’s older than the NASCAR drivers who constantly preach it: ""Rubbin’ is racin’."" Each team is given five weeks to build their cars. Though they have different paint jobs, each car is almost identically set up. When completed, they look like futuristic soap box derby cars. The top three teams in the School Series race got to celebrate on the same podium as the Formula E drivers.  This race wasn't just for fun — the winning team was awarded $5,000 for their school's tech club. Second place took home $2,500, and third place received $1,500.  Each driver was instructed to keep a safe distance from the others, an order that many discarded after the first lap. The School Series race in Miami was held on the same 1.3-mile course that the Formula E cars used. The teams had to find their own places to practice with the kit cars; one used their school's bus garage, another used a running track. A driver attacks the straightaway constructed on Miami's Biscayne Boulevard. The cars reached top speeds of over 30mph. Drivers race through the 90-degree turns underneath the 395 overpass. On some of the sloped sections in Miami, the cars hit speeds of over 40mph. A student takes a final look at the course map before strapping in for the race. The School Series ""paddock"" was nothing more than a tent, but by the end of the day it was full of fans of all ages looking for a photo with the drivers — and the cars. One of the teams takes a break from the heat. Construction of the track was still being finished on race day, so the School Series teams had a lot of waiting around to do. Teams were making last minute adjustments right up until the moment they had to line the cars up on the tracks. The drivers were equipped with an essential tool for first-timers on the track: mirrors. The tires used in the school series, like the ones used by Formula E, were supplied by Michelin. The cars had to be set up according to certain specifications, but the teams were allowed to use different tire pressures. Students had to wear safety helmets, fire suits, and strap into five-point safety harnesses just like the pilots of Formula E. A reporter from WLPG 10 in Miami interviews one of the competitors. The School Series paddock drew more and more attention throughout the day, especially since fans didn't have access to where the Formula E cars were parked.  The eight-student team from Englewood wasn't originally supposed to be in the race. One of the schools dropped out less than four weeks before the race, so the technology student association at Englewood High School got the call instead. When they opened up the boxes, everything was in disarray — the steering rod was bent and parts were missing. The students laughed it off. ""It builds character,"" one said.   A track official familiarizes students with the rules at a track safety meeting before qualifying. Not everyone completed the race. This unlucky driver got squeezed into the wall early on and had to coast to a stop. Family members and fans watch the School Series race on a giant screen hung from the facade of the American Airlines Arena. One of the competitors watches a Formula E car zip by on the track. The series' directors even have access to the live timing technology that was set up around the track.  There are no pedals in the School Series kit cars — just a throttle button and a handbrake. Members of the team from Englewood High School in Englewood, Florida, scrawled a simple reminder on the dashboard: ""Don't use brakes.""",0.5376983173437124,0.46230168265628757,0.8615621732113713,1379,4.6968817984046414,643,5.979782270606532,0,56,"Transportation, Photo Essay, Report"

Affected flights appeared to include AA2413, AA2276, AA1654, AA235, and AA128. Attempts to reach American Airlines directly were not initially successful, but the company confirmed the issue to passenger Bill Jacaruso via Twitter.  The issue affected ""a few dozen"" flights ""Some flights are experiencing an issue with a software application on pilot iPads,"" American Airlines spokesperson Andrea Huguely later told The Verge. ""In some cases, the flight has had to return to the gate to access a Wi-Fi connection to fix the issue. We apologize for the inconvenience to our customers.

""We've identified the issue, we've identified the solution, and we are working on it right now."" Jacaruso, 54, was traveling home to Austin from Dallas/Fort Worth airport on flight AA1654 with his wife, Toni, and his beagle, Masita. ""We got on the plane and it was supposed to leave at 8:20PM CT. We got on at 8 and just sat there,"" he tells The Verge.  The pilot got on the intercom after a while and said that his copilot's iPad went blank, then 24 minutes later the pilot's went blank too, according to Jacaruso. The entire American Airlines fleet is at a ground stop b/c the pilots' iPads can't retrieve the flight plans. @AmericanAir, keep us posted.  The pilot then announced to Jacaruso's plane that all iPads on 737s were affected.  About 45 minutes later, the pilot came back on to say, ""It looks like it's not just 737s, it's random, but no one's going anywhere til we figure it out."" Jacaruso then deplaned with his wife and dog, and is now renting a car to drive to Austin. Kristin Thompson, a passenger flying from JFK to Seattle on SS235, tells The Verge that two systems failed and had to be ""completely rebooted."" In 2012, American Airlines became the first airline to get FAA approval for iPad use in all stages of flight from gate to gate. Many airlines use iPads as an electronic flight bag, which can save significant fuel costs by replacing bulky 35-pound manuals, but American Airlines' FAA approval allowed it to use the tablets under 10,000 feet before it became commonplace for passengers.

Beyond cars, Tesla will have the ability to provide batteries to other industries, and that includes home solar.

It's a show high on visuals and low on exposition, aiming to entertain children more than enlighten adults.  The exhibition begins with a gallery called ""Digital Archaeology"" that highlights key moments in the UK's technological awakening. It features row upon row of ancient machines such as the Magnavox Odyssey, the Speak & Spell, an original Pong cabinet, and a Linn LM-1 Drum Machine. From there, a small section focuses on how computers have changed filmmaking with looks at Inception, Gravity, and How To Train Your Dragon 2.  With the history of ""technology changing art"" established, Digital Revolution then showcases a number of new works from contemporary artists and entertainers, culminating in a spectacular interactive laser exhibit from Umbrellium. Included in the exhibit is a new collaboration between Japanese designer Yuri Suzuki and will.i.am, four interactive pieces from Google's DevArt project, and a small area showing indie games. ""The show is really artist-led, but also looks at technology, and the technology stories that are very important to the show as it progresses,"" curator Conrad Bodman tells The Verge. ""It's the first show of its kind in the UK that explores the idea of digital creativity quite holistically."" Digital Revolution opens today and runs through to September 14th, and the Barbican will also be running one-off events linked to art and technology, such as the world premiere performance of a new audio-visual collaboration between The Velvet Underground's John Cale, architect Liam Young, and an orchestra comprised of drones. All images copyright Matthew G Lloyd / Getty Images.  The exhibition opens with a gallery full of historic technology. A Magnavox Odyssey, Apple II computer, Nintendo Entertainment System, and ZX Spectrum are all present. An interactive exhibit lets visitors wave their arms to explore how Inception's physics-defying special effects were created. Pyramidi is the work of Japanese designer Yuri Suzuki and will.i.am. It features a trio of robotic instruments: deconstructed versions of a piano, a guitar, and a drum. Visually mesmerizing, the exhibit is accompanied by a visualization of will.i.am that appears to follow you around the room. ""This is Mona Lisa times a trillion,"" remarks will.i.am. The Treachery of Sanctuary by Chris Milk uses Kinect cameras and 3D graphics to form a modern take on shadow play. Broken into three sections, it explores birth, death, and transfiguration — the third section augments giant wings onto your silhouette. Google's ambitious DevArt project invited creatives around the world to create art using code, with the prize being a spot at Digital Revolution. A trio of exhibits from established names is accompanied by an interactive installation by Cyril Diagne and  Béatrice Lartigue, who won the competition. New York-based artist Zach Lieberman's contribution to DevArt is a keyboard that samples sounds in real-time from hundreds of radio stations around the world. Vavara + Mar's enchanting exhibit Wishing Wall, also part of Google's DevArt, turns whispered wishes into digital butterflies. The Petting Zoo entices visitors to interact with playful robotic arms .

It's a bulbous, van-like hybrid that evokes the nostalgia we feel for the classic VW Microbus, but lives in a future world where car design is free to be whimsical — if not a little weird. Galvani also imagined the features and the details of how the van would operate: a rear engine paired with an electric motor, big knobby semi-cross tires, a tablet-based center panel display, and of course a mini-fridge with room for eight cans of your beverage of choice. Though Galvani says it would weigh about 3,570 pounds, what it really weighs is nothing; it's as solid as the CAD rendering file it was made with, as hefty as our dreams of touring a national park on Mars while ensconced in a glass-and-metal orb. You can see more of the Nimbus below, or visit Galvani's site for a full gallery.  The Nimbus is a bubble-shaped combination of curved glass, carbon-fiber, titanium, aluminum, and whimsy. A ladder and roof rack help evoke the classic VW Microbus. Galvani imagines the Nimbus would offer four drive modes, including 4WD. It would also have sensors for obstacle detection. The 130Kw (180hp) electrical engine would be mounted in the back and also powered by a gasoline engine.  Alongside the roof storage, the Nimbus would have solar panels to help power itself.  The central feature of the dashboard would be a multi-function, removable tablet. The Nimbus seats only five people, however, to better make room for the built-in refrigerator. The Nimbus has a proposed range of 200 miles and a max speed of 100 mph. Galvani says the Nimbus would have a ""safe virtual position,"" with drivers and passengers situated high above the ground. The Nimbus could be the perfect vehicle for observing the Tyrannosaurus Rex. Jeff Goldblum could not be reached for comment.

The host of Truth or Consequences, a popular radio gameshow at the time, offered to air his program from the first town that named itself after the show. And so, the town of Hot Springs, New Mexico, became the town of Truth or Consequences, New Mexico. More than 60 years later, Truth or Consequences has kept its distinctive name, and gained something similarly rare: the world's first commercial spaceport. Truth or Consequences is the closest town to Spaceport America, a facility that commercial spaceflight companies such as Virgin Galactic and SpaceX plan to use to fire paying passengers past our atmosphere. Spaceport America officially opened in 2011. Twenty suborbital missions have already been launched from the spaceport, and commercial spaceflight companies SpaceX and Virgin Galactic have deals that allow them to use the desert facility for test flights and planned launches  — but the center is not quite ready to be a bustling spaceport just yet. Companies such as SpaceX are rapidly iterating on their spacecraft, but for now, the building that might soon let us regular citizens slip the surly bonds of Earth waits in the high desert as technology and funding catch up with our dreams. Photographer Dan Hendrickson captures both the spaceport, and the oddly named town it sits near, in his appropriately titled photo essay SP^CEPORT. Hendrickson says the differences between the two places offer a fascinating dichotomy ""between an American town that can sometimes feel like another planet, and a spaceport that promises to take passengers into outer space."" Images courtesy of Dan Hendrickson.  Hot Springs renamed itself Truth or Consequences in 1950 in a bid to boost tourism to the small town. Around 6,000 people live in the settlement today. Spaceport America is located about 20 miles southeast of the town. A visitor center for the spaceport is slated to be built nearby, but its budget was scaled back earlier this year. Photographer Dan Hendrickson says Truth or Consequences has held several referendums to see if the populace want to change the town's name back to Hot Springs. None have passed. Hendrickson says Truth or Consequences ""self-identifies as an artistic community."" The show it's named after ran for almost 40 years on American radio. The remote location means that the spaceport's builders have had to construct infrastructure where there was none. Hendrickson describes ""ghostly"" parking lots alone in the desert, not yet attached to spaceport buildings that will come later. Over the nearby mountains lies the White Sands missile test range. The spaceport benefits from the location: the US government has restrictions on airplanes from using the nearby airspace. This 10,000 foot runway will theoretically allow large carrier airplanes to take off, deposit space-faring craft near the Earth's atmosphere, and then land again. This is Spaceport America's Operations Center. The building, which Hendrickson notes is affectionately called ""the sock,"" houses the facility's mission control center on its upper floor. The Federal Aviation Administration will regulate commercial spaceflight from the center, rather than NASA. The spaceport, along with Virgin Galactic, signed an agreement with the FAA earlier this year. Virgin Galactic has exclusive use of Spaceport America's main terminal, but other tenants include Armadillo Airspace, UP Aerospace, and Elon Musk's SpaceX.

He works behind the counter at a deli in Brooklyn, a small shop that does a brisk business in snacks, coffee, and cigarettes. In June of last year, on a whim and mostly out of boredom, Abuhamdeh mounted his phone next to the register and began to broadcast his day on YouNow, a live streaming service. His handle was Mr. Cashier.  “I was talking to myself at first,” he says. “No one was there. But I was nervous, I felt like there were people watching. I was quiet. It was weird.” After a few weeks of broadcasting he began to find his rhythm. “Eventually I started opening up, saying random things, telling jokes and laughing at my own jokes. I started to act like people were there watching, and that’s when they showed up.” Abuhamdeh’s routine was subtle. People would walk up and pay, he would ring them up, and then as they left, nail them with a zinger spoken to the camera. If a customer was in on the joke, Abuhamdeh would banter with them a bit. He shared stories from his home life, and slowly began to invite fans into it, broadcasting from his apartment, from a cousin’s wedding, while driving in his car or getting a haircut.  His broadcasting schedule swelled from one or two hours a day to appearing live in four two-hour sessions. His fanbase grew, but so did his phone bill. “I was using up around 70GB of data each month, and I’m with Verizon so you know that’s not cheap.” He was addicted to the interaction with the audience, but couldn’t afford to keep up with his costs. So he sent a letter to YouNow, which put him on its partner program, allowing him to earn money when his fans left digital tips and gifts.  These days a typical Mr. Cashier broadcast has several hundred people following live at any time. “At first, it got to be enough so I could cover my phone bill. Now I make more every month on YouNow than I do from my work at the store,” Abuhamdeh tells me. Along with broadcasting, Abuhamdeh texts and talks on the phone with his followers. “I get close to my supporters. I FaceTime with them. We become friends.” A couple of times he’s broadcast from his bedroom while sleeping. “Just cause they asked for that. They want to see everything that you do.”    YouNow launched back in September of 2012, but for its first year and a half struggled to find traction. Then in May of last year it suddenly clicked, exploding from less than 10 million monthly visitors to more than 100 million in the span of just four months. More than 35,000 hours of live video are now streamed on the service each day, and more than a million dollars in tips flow through its platform each month.     ""The reason is the rise of iOS and Android,"" says Emmett Shear, the CEO of Twitch. He tried and failed to launch a general purpose live streaming service with Justin.TV. Eventually he pivoted into gaming, a niche where being tied to a desktop computer made sense. But now the mobile market is mature enough for a sea change.  ""Smartphones provide all the critical pieces for these new services. They take care of distribution through the app store, monetization through in-app purchases, incredible video quality through cameras and microphones, and connectivity everywhere with LTE internet."" The growth and ubiquity of social networks is also ""creating an amplifier effect for good consumer products."" YouNow is run by founder and CEO Adi Sideman, who knows very well the long history of failed experiments with live streaming. ""It is a dream that a lot of people have been thinking about for a long time,"" Sideman told me, relaxing at a conference table in his midtown New York office. ""It is a holy grail.""       Watching a YouNow stream can be an overwhelming experience. The comments on popular videos fly by far too quickly for the broadcaster to follow. Often you see streamers squinting to make out a username, trying to reply in real time to the flood of compliments and questions.  ""It’s all about the addiction to real time feedback and the nodes in the brain that it triggers,"" Sideman tells me.   Sideman decides to give me a live demo. He tunes in to the channel of a user named FlippinGinja, a red-headed teen and amateur gymnast who is lounging on his porch swing. ""Guys, I’ve been drinking too much water,"" he tells his smartphone camera. With the press of a few buttons Sideman tips Ginja the equivalent of $5, along with a message asking him to flip for Ben. ""Everybody comment in the chat. Ben this flip is dedicated to you, for being so awesome. Everybody say, 'We love Ben' in the chat."" While the chat lights up with people chanting my name, Ginja dashes down his steps onto his front lawn, does an amazing corkscrew backflip, does it again for good measure, and then heads back to the porch, where he continues bantering a mile a minute, skimming the comments like a pro, dispensing jokes, attention, and affection in just the right doses. Despite myself, I feel a rush of excitement, the thrill of having another human perform just for me. ""The broadcaster is not the only content creator in the room,"" says Sideman. ""It’s really a one to many experience that feels like one to one. That is the heart, the secret. Even payment, there is feedback on the screen, feedback from the broadcaster, feedback from the audience, it’s part of the show."" One of the interesting aspects of Meerkat’s success is how top down it has been. Before it had a sizable user base it blew up on Product Hunt, becoming an overnight darling of influencers in tech and media. Last week Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Al Roker, and Jimmy Fallon all took the service for a spin. Before it had even cracked into the top 1,000 apps in the iOS store, Meerkat was the subject of countless articles and had become one more arrow in the quiver for celebrities with well established personal brands. Instead of a photo or video of someone famous doing something fabulous, you get a livestream instead. But so far it doesn’t have its own community, or any everyman stars. YouNow is the complete opposite. It’s one of the top grossing social apps on iOS, but its most popular users are largely unknown teenagers. They aren’t broadcasting from exciting places or doing interesting things. A lot of what happens on YouNow feels like the PG-13 version of Cam Girls, part confessional conversation, part vaudeville performance.     That’s not to say everything on YouNow is softcore teen solipsism. There are plenty of striving rappers, guitar players, and dancers. FlippinGinja’s father, after seeing how much his son was earning, emailed asking if he too could become a paid content partner. Dad broadcasts extended rants, often while driving, on the state of pop music, politics, his hyperactive son. FlippinDad now regularly pulls in a hundred or more viewer during broadcasts.  ""So now there is a second camera in this reality show!"" Sideman says with excitement. There is talent on YouNow, but an equal amount of banality. The fascination of the audience seems less tethered to what the person is doing on screen, and more to the amount of time they are willing to spend in front of the camera, the level of intimacy they are comfortable cultivating. I spoke on the phone with Rudan, a 20-something Texan who dropped out of college, leaving behind a degree in computer science for full time broadcasting. ""The people who support us will watch us do anything. There are times when I fall asleep on broadcast, and wake up, the stream has been going for 10 or 12 hours and people are still watching, still commenting, still giving tips,"" says Rudan. The chat on his live streams is too busy for a real conversation, but fans engage fans in deeper conversation on Snapchat, and through text messages and phone calls. ""They follow you wherever you go, they text you, they start telling you their story. You become a role model, an inspiration."" While his live stream is typically an upbeat affair, full of jokes, horseplay and goofy voices, Rudan says the relationships with fans are often quite serious. ""People don’t seem to understand, broadcasting is very stressful. The main audience is young teenage girls. The biggest topic of discussion is suicide and cutting. It gets pretty deep. When I first started I got depressed."" He sees himself as someone they can turn to for comfort and entertainment. ""I don’t like to call it counselor, or therapist, but usually that’s what you do when you broadcast. You help people smile, keep them happy. We’re all hungry for what we feel is a meaningful connection with our fellow humans. Modern technology is allowing that deep desire to play out in some very strange ways. I ask Sideman, YouNow’s CEO, what he makes of the content on the site he created. ""It’s raw. If you look at our homepage, it’s very raw. There is nothing packaged about it. Eventually there will be. But it’s in that exciting stage. It reminds me of the early days of the internet,"" he says. It remains to be seen if live streaming will have more staying power in the mobile era than it did in the dot-com days. As we talk Sideman tunes into the channel for Rudan. We catch him shirtless, cooking a meal, singing to himself, and working the chat room. ""It’s nice to see people with real talent,"" he says, ""And ‘What is talent?’ is also a great subjective question.""",0.6406188302381995,0.35938116976180046,0.5134097259316214,1667,4.6592681463707262,818,6.1075794621026898,0,12,"Business, Culture, Tech, Web, Report"

Today, Square announced that it is bringing the service to businesses, allowing them to accept Square Cash payments in place of a check or paper money. The video introducing the service offers a clue to the market Square is hoping to capture. It shows street musicians, house painters, Craigslist sellers, and charities, all enterprises that might want to lower the friction around payments but not deal with the hassle and fees of credit cards. Using Square Cash costs 1.5 percent per transaction, a big saving over the 2.75 percent Square charges on payments through its card reader. For now, Square Cash works with debit cards only.  To use the service, the business creates a ""$Cashtag"" — a screen name proceeded by a dollar sign — that they can share with customers. This makes it easy to market and distribute your payment point on a business card or website, as well as offering the ability to retain some anonymity. You can ask anyone to pay for that couch on Craigslist, and all they will have is your handle, not your full name.

For $2.99 a month, Vessel gives subscribers early access to the videos that will eventually be posted to YouTube and elsewhere. Following an invitation-only public beta, Vessel is now available to everyone — and if you sign up in the next 72 hours, you can get it free for a year. That’s right, a year. To entice creators to begin ""windowing"" their videos, Vessel needs to offer them large audiences. And those audiences may be skeptical of paying a monthly subscription to get an advance look at videos that will be available for free as little as three days later. That’s why Vessel is offering 12 months of free access to its premium service — and you won’t even have to provide your credit card number to get it. (There’s also an ad-supported version of Vessel that features non-exclusive videos; that will always be free.) More than 130 top YouTube creators have joined Vessel  There are now more than 130 creators who are posting their videos to Vessel first, including Phil DeFranco’s show ""The Vloggity,"" GloZell Green, and Tré Melvin. How tempted you are to subscribe to Vessel likely depends on whether you consider yourself a true fan of any of the individual creators. (The company says its creators reached a combined audience of 200 million people on free services.) The early-access videos are complemented by clips from big conglomerates, which are part of the free version. NBC will offer clips from The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon and Late Night with Seth Meyers, and the NBA is providing game recaps. You’ll find plenty more videos from other partners including Machinima, Funny or Die, CollegeHumor, and VEVO. ""A clean, well-lighted place"" Vessel is available on the web and on iOS, with Android to follow in the coming months. And it’s a beautiful place to watch videos: the design replaces YouTube’s manic clutter with what Kilar likes to call a ""clean, well-lighted place."" Video thumbnails are large, and many of them are animated. Dozens of former Hulu employees left to come work at Vessel, and you can tell: the interfaces are similarly clean and intuitive. It remains to be seen whether fans will pay extra for early access to their favorite web stars. And there’s a second looming question: if Vessel is successful, how will YouTube respond? If there turns out to be a billion-dollar business in serving what is essentially windowed YouTube content, you can assume Google will have something to say about it. In the meantime, though, it’s worth checking out what Kilar and his team have built. In a year where the big social networks are all making big investments in video, Vessel may be the most interesting experiment of all.",0.35015536644990164,0.6498446335500984,0.8676667530087531,493,4.9188640973630831,292,5.8424657534246576,0,0,"Business, Culture, Entertainment, Tech, Web, Report"

Peter Chou, who had filled the role since 2005 and led HTC's rise from an anonymous contract manufacturer to a global smartphone brand, is being replaced by company co-founder Cher Wang. Wang immediately becomes the focal point of all decision making at HTC, taking responsibility for broad corporate strategy as well as final product decisions. This marks the formalization of a handover of power that began in 2013 when Chou was said to be temporarily offloading operational duties to Wang in order to focus his attention on product development. Now that he's being demoted, he can make heading up the new Future Development Lab his full-time occupation.  It's too late to change the One M9, but never too late to correct course The timing of this change is stark, coming mere days before the global release of the HTC One M9. Even if HTC's CEO transition was an orderly one that had been planned well in advance, announcing it at such a critical point in the company's development suggests that it was accelerated by recent events. The M9 has drawn the ire of many of HTC's most loyal fans for sticking too closely to the look and design of its predecessors, and though HTC had been betting big on the new phone's camera being a standout feature, early results have been underwhelming. This negative response seems to have caught HTC off guard, and the company is now taking the most drastic of actions to correct its course. It's too late to change the One M9, but it's not too early to start rectifying the mistakes that have led to its ambivalent reception. In spite of spending tens of millions of dollars on having Robert Downey Jr. as its brand ambassador, HTC's biggest failure continues to be effective marketing. The company has been cycling through Chief Marketing Officers in search of a better way to communicate with consumers, but it still can't achieve the sort of cachet that allows Apple to reissue the same iPhone design for two years running without suffering a loss of sales. The unchanged One M9 design is not actually a problem, but it's perceived as such and that is an issue in and of itself. HTC's marketing woes wouldn't be so severe if the company could keep its secrets secret Leaks haven't helped the One M9's fortunes, either. Like almost every previous flagship Android phone from HTC, the 2015 One leaked out in pictures and video days ahead of its unveiling, and most of its new features were known about weeks in advance. Compare that to all the misdirection surrounding Samsung's Galaxy S6, which made a bigger and better impression when it was announced on the same day as the M9. Verge Video: Hands-on with the HTC M9 Beyond its flagship smartphone, HTC also has to deal with a mobile market that's growing increasingly hostile to manufacturers of its type and size. The Taiwanese company does not have control over its supply chain, and has to shop for parts like everyone not named Samsung, Apple, or (to a lesser extent) LG. HTC also lacks any real sway over carriers, and is often forced to bundle bloatware on its phones to make them appealing to network operators. In the uphill struggle to secure the best possible components and the widest possible distribution, HTC is fighting only with the advantage of a great design pedigree. That matters, but not as much as Apple and Samsung's scale or the lower costs of Chinese competitors like the rapidly growing Xiaomi. HTC's future depends on new devices like the Vive VR as much as any One smartphone To survive, HTC is trying to diversify with a new Re range of connected products. The Re Camera kicked things off at the end of 2014, and this month's Mobile World Congress saw the debut of an HTC Grip fitness-tracking band and the pleasant surprise that was the HTC Vive VR headset. HTC is ready to evolve from a smartphone manufacturer to the purveyor of connected devices and experiences. ""The overwhelming response that our virtual reality product, HTC Vive, received earlier this month underlines the importance of these new connected technologies for our future,"" says Cher Wang in a statement accompanying today's news announcement. She is bullish on expanding HTC's portfolio and her predecessor, Peter Chou, is said to be actively involved in the development and refinement of the Vive and more products like it. On the surface, at least, this power realignment at HTC appears to make sense. Operational and marketing deficiencies have plagued HTC (and continue with the silly injection of Re into the Grip and Vive branding, forcing most people to read them as ReGrip and ReVive), and neither can be said to be among Peter Chou's strengths. ""I think I am the best candidate. I suggested it."" Enthusiasm for change must be tempered by the fact that Wang has been sharing operational decision making with Chou for the past 18 months, and thus has to accept a share of the blame for HTC's failures. With full control now established over the company, she'll bear the full responsibility for steering HTC into the right direction. ""I know the company, I know the people, and I have the vision,"" Wang tells Bloomberg News in an interview. ""I think I am the best candidate. I suggested it."" HTC describes its change of leader as a transition, though it feels like one that is being completed rather than only just beginning. Former CEO Peter Chou had once promised to resign if the original One was not a success, which underlines how closely and personally involved he was with the company's smartphone business. Now that HTC is working to define itself as the manufacturer of a much broader range of devices, it makes sense to redefine its leadership as well.",0.5334934405679902,0.4665065594320098,0.843504275458058,1001,4.802197802197802,506,6.2312252964426875,2,0,"Business, Mobile, Tech, Report"

The company has quietly announced a new local advertising service for Google Fiber that will make TV ads behave a lot more like internet ads. Using data from its set-top-boxes, Google (and advertisers) will know precisely how many times a particular local ad has been watched in homes with Google Fiber service. That might not sound like a big deal, but the industry-standard Nielsen ratings simply don't offer that kind of information. Like on the web, Google will only charge for the number of views an ad receives. That's not all. Google will use some viewer data, like what show you're watching or what shows you've watched in the past to try and target the ads for maximum effect. The company even hints that ads can be fine-tuned for where you live — for instance, you might see a different local ad during the football game than your friend who lives on the other side of town. Advertisers will even be able to tell Google to stop showing an ad once a particular household has seen it a certain number of times. The service is launching as a limited trial in Kansas City for now, and could expand to Google Fiber's other launch cities soon. Google is offering data that Nielsen simply doesn't have Cable companies have long sold advertising time during nationally-broadcast shows to local small businesses — that's how that goofy ad for your local used car dealer makes it onto your TV during the latest episode of your favorite show. But those are far more static than what Google's envisioning. This is a flexible system, where ads can be inserted and swapped out on-the-fly, in ""real time."" It's not yet clear precisely how the system will work, but, similar to Google's cornerstone AdWords business, algorithms might determine the best time to show you a certain ad. For instance, if you're watching the news before flipping over to the football game, the system might determine that you should be served a different ad during halftime than your buddy who switched over to the game from Pawn Stars. Google says it will even be able to swap out ads on DVR'd programs, so you won't be served an old or irrelevant advertisement if you watch a program a week after it originally aired. Fiber customers will have an option to disable ads based on viewing history, Google notes. With the possible exception of TiVo's little-known research division, which offers second-to-second, randomized viewer data to marketers, there's simply no way to get the kind of data Google is promising with its new service. The TV industry works off of Nielsen ratings, which pulls viewership data from a relatively tiny cross-section of viewers with meters installed in their homes. That data is then extrapolated to give total US viewership numbers.  Nevertheless, despite the opportunities for advertisers, it's hard to imagine how Google could expand its TV ad service to the more lucrative national market — the system is dependent on Google controlling the hardware in people's homes. And since Nielsen ratings have proven incredibly resilient over the years despite technological advances, it's unlikely Google will take over any time soon.

He gets drunk in public, gropes women at the bar, and is having an affair with an unpaid intern. And to top it all off, he’s scheduled to speak at South by Southwest tomorrow — at a panel about women and technology. Fortunately, Jacobs isn’t real — he’s a simulation organized by a company named Polpeo. Polpeo, a subsidiary of the social media management firm eModeration, specializes in a novel new corporate exercise: the simulated brand crisis. Police officers train for various crises all the time; so do airline pilots. But most corporations don’t — even as the rise of social networks allows bad news about them to spread globally at record speed. More than a quarter of brand-related failures typically go international within an hour on social media, according to Polpeo, and a year after the crisis passes, more than half of companies haven’t recovered their share price. ""Don't be shy — it's a crisis."" If you remember AT&T’s ill-considered 9/11 tweet, or Malaysia Airlines’ slowness in addressing the disappearance of flight 370, you start to understand why companies could benefit from a drill. As a journalist, I’m usually the one chronicling the fallout of brand disasters. What I’ve never known is what they feel like on the inside, to the social media managers trying to put out the fires on Facebook, Twitter, and the websites of major news sites. My gut feeling tells me that it’s a combination of telling people you take their concerns very seriously, while lying to them about the details. But who knows? So when I learn Polpeo is staging a brand crisis simulation at SXSW, I jump at the chance to attend. It proves incredibly popular — organizers have to turn people away — but when the doors open, I manage to secure a seat. ""Don’t be shy — it’s a crisis,"" laughs Tamara Littleton, Polpeo’s energetic CEO, as we file in. Littleton keeps apologizing for how ""stressful"" the day is going to be, but she speaks with the beneficent authority of Mary Poppins, and the two-hour simulation unfolds with the practiced grace of an English tea service. We’re arranged into five teams — each a motley crew of total strangers, most with a background in public relations or crisis communications. Littleton explains the premise of the simulation: Jacobs is the CEO of our firm, an up-and-coming social network named Mitra, and it’s our job to protect the brand or die trying. We’ll respond to the crisis using various simulated social networks, while a team of Polpeo employees works behind the scenes, replying to our communications in real time from a host of puppet accounts. My mission is clear: I have to destroy them They’re also scoring us using some arcane algorithms that never really get explained — all we know is that our goal is to keep our score above 0, where it starts. (Companies routinely score –8 in these simulations, Polpeo warns us.) I take a look around the room at the PR people sitting nearby, imagining them lying to me in some future real-world crisis. My mission is clear: I have to destroy them. We log into Polpeo’s custom simulator. It’s not pretty, but it has a working clone of Twitter (called ""Flipper"") and of Facebook (""SocialNetwork""). When the simulation starts, we’ll receive alerts each time the plot thickens. And it does: In short order, our CEO is seen getting drunk at a bar, hitting on the women there. Someone sees him snorting cocaine, just as a reporter starts live blogging his behavior. And the crowd on Flipper quickly turns mean. For a time, we are paralyzed. ""Does @Mitra even have a PR department?"" a fake user of a fake social network sneers about my fake company. ""Are they ALL off in a bar getting drunk?""   It’s not immediately clear what we should do. We begin reading through all the tweets — er, ""flips"" — and wonder aloud about how we might respond to them. Tentatively, we type out cryptic messages to our followers: ""We are aware of the situation,"" we keep telling them, in language that makes us sound strangely like we work for the Pentagon and are briefing the press about the latest events in Syria. Littleton notices that our group has no leader, or direction, and suggests we pick one of each. We consider this, then resume our former strategy of just shouting at each other around the table. We are in crisis. In time, though, we develop a rough hierarchy. A woman named Angelique takes over community management, issuing tight-lipped replies and apologies to the users of the various social networks. A man named Suvesh volunteers to begin writing press releases. People are demanding information from us, and it falls to him to craft our response. ""We need to answer the question without acknowledging the issue,"" Suvesh says. Clearly we have the right man for the job. ""Answer the question without acknowledging the issue."" Then our CEO’s intern girlfriend posts to our official SocialNetwork account saying she is ""in amazeballs bar in Austin partying with my super hot man. Best boss in the world. Love you Lucian!"" Deleting the comment will only lead to more news stories, but we do it anyway. I email the CEO asking him to explain himself. And I email SXSW telling them that we can no longer participate in the panel. Our score rises from 0 to 1.6. Mitra’s fake COO emails us saying everyone is jet-lagged from travel and just arriving in Austin, which we know to be a lie. I send him a strongly worded note — I have taken charge of executive relations — and ask him what we should put in the press release. Suvesh will write the press release, I tell my colleagues, but I want our fake COO to feel as if he is important. ""I do that all the time,"" one of my colleagues in PR confides. The simulator starts dinging us for not responding to people quickly enough. One of the community managers suggest we start responding faster — while using the frowny-face emoji. ""It humanizes the brand,"" he says. And you know what? He’s right. I'm starting to feel like I'm high Without telling us, the COO gives an interview to a news site directing people to Jacobs’ panel the next day, which I had just canceled on his behalf. I send him a note worded so strongly that one teammate tells me I will probably be fired. ""This is what they hired me for,"" I growl. ""I’m going down with this ship."" I’m starting to feel like I’m high. We need a statement from our CEO, but can’t reach him. Then I remember that we are in PR, and PR people can just make things up. So we write up a nice, contrite statement for the idiot and send it out to the press. After 90 minutes, something truly exciting happens: a cookie break. We are supposed to use this time to relax and network. But my team, which turns out to be wonderfully devious, decides to work through it. I decide to take my lying game up to the next level and invent a helpful backstory for Lucian Jacobs. As soon as the simulation picks back up, our statements to the press all begin to include this line: ""As you may recall, last year Lucian donated $10 million of his personal fortune to organizations supporting women in technology."" ""I quit. I quit Mitra!"" No matter what we do, though, Jacobs’ hijinks are always one step ahead of our efforts to contain them. Suddenly I understand how it must feel to be Charlie Sheen’s publicist. By the time Jacobs is arrested for indecent exposure, one of my teammates collapses in a heap. ""I quit,"" she says. ""I quit Mitra!"" Two hours after we have begun, Littleton calls time. The scores are tabulated, and the red team — my team — has come in first place, with a score of 6.6. There are high fives all around as I look down at the losers at the adjoining tables, with their busted social strat and weak-ass emoji game. In the final fake news story about the crisis, I am referred to as a Mitra spokeswoman. I earned that title, and I wear it with pride. Polpeo wrote up many brand-focused takeaways about their event, which you can read here if you like. As for me, I went into the simulation feeling quite skeptical, but left believing most big corporations will want to invest in drills like these. News really does move insanely fast on social media, and you might as well be prepared. Whether you’re a person or a business, you’re never more than one tweet away from total disaster. So it’s worth thinking about how you’ll respond when, inevitably, you say or do the wrong thing. Billion-dollar companies may still scoff at the idea of dropping everything to respond to some angry tweets — and yet if there’s anything we’ve learned online this decade, it’s that the vengeful mobs that form on social networks can be terribly effective. My other big takeaway from social media crises: use the frowny-face emoji wherever you can.

Streaming services like Spotify, Rdio, and Pandora have buoyed a long-declining market with the support of eager music labels, but it seems those very same labels are starting to get nervous about their revenue streams. Universal Music Group, the largest of all labels, is beginning to question the ""freemium"" model that helped bring in over a billion dollars in revenue from US streaming last year. According to the Financial Times, Universal is leveraging current contract negotiations with Spotify to pressure the streaming service to put harsher limits on its free service. The label hopes that such a move would convert more free users into paid subscriptions, which cost $10 per month. CEO Lucian Grainge publicly stated his concerns with the freemium model last month, when he said, ""Ad-funded on-demand is not going to sustain the entire ecosystem of the creators as well as the investors."" Universal hopes to use contract negotiations to limit free streaming Other labels are coming to the conclusion that ad-supported free streaming services need to be adjusted, according to reports. Unnamed sources tell Rolling Stone that ""most"" labels are pushing for more limits on free music streaming. In addition to Universal, both the Sony Music and Warner Music CEOs have recently expressed doubts about free streaming — one said paid and free subscriptions need to be more ""clearly differentiated."" It's not known if either of those two labels are seeking to pressure Spotify or other services through contract negotiations. Spotify says free is necessary to boost growth The labels may seek to limit the amount of music users can listen to without paying up. Or they might hope to limit all free streaming to Pandora-like radio stations instead of on-demand music. Spotify and Rdio both allow for unlimited free on-demand streaming on computers, but limit mobile streaming to shuffled, radio-like services. Paid subscribers get full mobile streaming, offline access, higher quality, and no ads. In the past, the labels were very supportive of free streaming — they saw it as a way to bring new customers (and money) into a declining industry. But as streaming grows and money continues to shift away from digital downloads and physical media, it seems the labels are becoming less comfortable. Spotify says that a substantial free service is the only proven way to get new paid subscribers, and it argues that the data shows that streaming isn't destroying proven revenue streams like iTunes. A spokesperson tells the Financial Times that ""Spotify is monetizing people who have never been monetized before."" Despite those arguments, it may come down to backroom negotiation tactics to see if free streaming survives in its current state.

But while it's clearly guiding the debate, the Supreme Court steered clear of discussing when exactly protected speech becomes an unprotected threat — a difficult question that's become especially important over the past year. The court has reversed the decision against Anthony Elonis, who was previously found guilty of four counts of transmitting threats. After his wife left him, Elonis wrote a series of Facebook posts fantasizing about killing her and others. He claimed that the posts, made in the style of free-form rap lyrics, were therapeutic and a form of constitutionally protected free speech, pointing to similar wife-killing fantasies by performer Eminem. His estranged wife, however, said she was afraid for her life after seeing them, going as far as to get a restraining order. A post about shooting children at an elementary school, then one about killing an FBI agent who questioned him about it, also ended up on the list of charges. ""Criminal liability generally does not turn solely on the results of an act."" Elonis argued that unless he intended to threaten his wife or anyone else with the posts, they couldn't be taken as ""true"" threats. Prosecutors, though, said that intent shouldn't matter — the real test was whether a ""reasonable person"" would find them threatening. While the Third Circuit federal court agreed with the ""reasonable person"" test, the Supreme Court now says that's not enough. In a majority opinion, Chief Justice John Roberts said that the law must consider someone's mental state when deciding threat cases. ""The jury was instructed that the Government need prove only that a reasonable person would regard Elonis' communications as threats, and that was error,"" Roberts wrote. ""Federal criminal liability generally does not turn solely on the results of an act without considering the defendant's mental state."" He compared it to earlier cases where someone arguably committed a crime, but only because they were genuinely mistaken about the circumstances around it. In one example, a defendant took spent shell casings from a government bombing range, but the court found he wasn't liable if he had good reason to believe the casings were abandoned. We still don't know whether the messages were true threats This case has raised complicated issues, particularly because it's not clear what a ""reasonable"" opinion would be. The internet can erase context and nuance around a joke, or it can make sending truly threatening statements easier. And depending on who you talk to, the standards for behavior can be very different. The ACLU has praised the decision to throw out ""objective"" judgment, saying this ""properly recognizes that the law has for centuries required the government to prove criminal intent before putting someone in jail."" The Supreme Court didn't, however, actually decide whether or not Elonis was sending threats — or what constitutes threats more generally. It says the jury should have taken Elonis' thought process, not just the content of the messages, into account. The case is going back to lower courts without a firm call on how much protection his speech should actually receive. ""It is unnecessary to consider any First Amendment issues,"" in fact, for this decision. But those issues will only get more important. If someone admits to sending a message to someone in order to make them fear for their life, for example, that's a clear-cut threat. But what if they send that message for other reasons, while still recognizing that the recipient will probably feel threatened? ""The court's disposition of this case is certain to cause confusion and serious problems."" This is the question that Samuel Alito discussed in his dissenting opinion. Alito didn't take issue with the idea that intent mattered, but thought the Supreme Court's decision was incomplete. ""The court’s disposition of this case is certain to cause confusion and serious problems,"" he said. ""Attorneys and judges need to know which mental state is required for conviction under [threat laws]. This case squarely presents that issue, but the Court provides only a partial answer."" Alito argues that even if Elonis wasn't explicitly sending threats, he was still criminally reckless. ""Someone who acts recklessly with respect to conveying a threat necessarily grasps that he is not engaged in innocent conduct,"" the opinion says. ""He is not merely careless. He is aware that others could regard his statements as a threat, but he delivers them anyway."" At this point, the outside context would also matter. The difference between Eminem and Elonis, to Alito, is that someone is more likely to take a Facebook post as a direct threat than a recorded song. ""To hold otherwise would grant a license to anyone who is clever enough to dress up a real threat in the guise of rap lyrics, a parody, or something similar."" While Alito doesn't mention it, we're more likely to see courts decide whether self-styled satirists can still make threats. In a relatively high-profile incident earlier this year, for example, a comedian apparently incorporated threats against real-life game developer Brianna Wu into a years-long performance art piece. The Elonis case can't tell us how much the fact that it's a joke matters, but it tells us that it does matter... at least to a point.",0.5079826588263023,0.49201734117369766,0.5702354873896333,901,5.1609322974472809,482,6.2925311203319501,0,0,"Policy & Law, US & World"

NSA officials told CNN that the agency's bulk metadata collection operation was shut down at 7:44pm Sunday night, a few hours in advance of the deadline. Sunday's session was a second chance for the Senate, after the chamber failed to pass the USA Freedom Act last Friday, putting portions of the legal basis for US surveillance in jeopardy. The Freedom Act passed cloture with 77 votes, and is likely to pass through the Senate later this week, but an ongoing filibuster from Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) meant the Senate was unable to pass the bill before the scheduled sunset of Patriot Act powers. Senator Paul has garnered significant publicity for his efforts in delaying the vote, including a remarkable and bizarre PAC ad which appeared to cheer on the filibuster on Friday. ""Slowing the momentum towards lasting reform."" The USA Freedom Act would extend the Patriot Act powers in exchange for curtailing surveillance activities elsewhere, a compromise between civil libertarians and national security hawks in Congress. The Freedom Act has the greatest effect on the collection of call records, putting telephony metadata in the hands of telecoms and enabling more transparency on any government requests for that data. The bill would also add a privacy advocate to the FISA court, although the advocate would have little meaningful power over the proceedings. Anti-surveillance groups have been split over the possible sunset of the Patriot Act powers. The American Civil Liberties Union had favored letting the Patriot Act expire, while groups like Access saw a compromise bill like the USA Freedom Act as the best chance for lasting reform. It's unclear how the NSA and other groups will respond to the sunset of Section 215, but some have speculated that the result will be an increased reliance on national security letters and investigation-specific surveillance powers, continuing the same basic surveillance under different legal powers. Significant collection also occurs under non-legislative powers like Executive Order 12333, which remains unaffected.

Rhee to move from a Vimeo account to a major production deal with a Hollywood veteran. His proof-of-concept short The Garden — a reimagining of John Milton's Paradise Lost set against the backdrop of a decaying sun — has been picked up by Polly Cohen Johnsen's Polymorphic Pictures, a subsidiary of Warner Bros. The studio is hoping The Garden can become the basis for a major new sci-fi franchise, an act of considerable vision given the short is only six minutes long. It makes up for its lack of length with visual flair and a balance between fantasy and realism that's tough to strike. The ostensible villains of The Garden are cartoonish, but they're also menacing. It's hard for an expensive feature to pull that off, much less a short thrown together with a little cash and pro bono labor. The Garden also manages to strike some resonant emotional notes, which is commendable given it's selling studios an idea rather than a bunch of developed characters. From a business perspective, it's easy to understand why The Garden was attractive to potential studio buyers. It has a simple, elegant hook that's familiar from movies like Interstellar — the planet is going to die, and humanity needs to find another home — and it looks great despite being shot for only $30,000. The short is coupled with a feature screenplay written by Rhee and Aaron Strongoni, meaning the studio doesn't have to invest time and money in fleshing out Rhee's idea.

But put on a pair of modified 3D glasses, and bam — it’s the Holodeck, and I’m on Tatooine standing face to face with one of the most famous robots in movie history. I walk around C-3PO, crouching one moment then jumping the next. The mo-cap performer across the room raises his hand, and the CG Threepio waves. It’s exhilarating and immersive, and it’s all happening in real time.  The cave is a place for filmmakers to test out worlds that don’t exist yet, and for ILM to demo and build augmented reality experiences for its recently unveiled skunkworks division, ILMxLab. The lab is a developmental playground for any and all kind of interactive or immersive experience. Virtual reality, AR, theme park attractions; it’s all up for grabs, uniting decades of visual effects expertise, computer wizardry, and Lucasfilm’s own creative team into a self-contained entertainment studio of the future.   The goal isn’t to just create what people will be trying out on their Oculus Rift next year. It’s to come up with the interconnected virtual experiences we’ll be having 10 years from now. And you’d better believe they’re starting with Star Wars.   When Rob Bredow left Sony Pictures Imageworks for ILM in 2014, it didn’t take him long to realize what he’d gotten himself into. ""It was like my first week here, and an assistant knocks on the door real urgently. ‘Yeah, did someone request a lightsaber from the showroom down the hall?’"" He grins, bright eyes sparkling behind his glasses. ""I’m definitely working at Lucasfilm now."" Bredow had spent the previous five years as Imageworks’ chief technology officer, a role that followed years of VFX experience on movies like Independence Day and The Polar Express. But as we walk through the halls of ILM, he tells me it was the chance to work on the new Star Wars films that lured him away. Now, as Lucasfilm’s head of New Media and vp of its Advanced Development Group, he oversees the intersection of technology and storytelling that is ILMxLab. The group is a collaboration between all arms of the Lucasfilm empire, taking the visual effects expertise of ILM, the latest in real-time computer graphics from the Advanced Development Group, and the audio prowess of Skywalker Sound, and mixing it all together under the incomparable appeal of the Star Wars franchise. It’s a unique effort; while other movie studios are teaming with tech companies to dabble in VR, and VR companies are spinning up their own mini production houses to dip their toes into film, ILM already has the necessary departments integrated under one roof — not to mention a highly-anticipated slate of films in production to play off of. It allows Bredow’s team to experiment with multiple types of experiences simultaneously, in a kind of next-generation entertainment sandbox. During my visit, the team has three projects to show off: the holographic cave, an iPad augmented reality movie with C-3PO and Boba Fett, and an Oculus Rift port of the same short film (with a VR speederbike ""bonus"" mode). According to Bredow, each of the experiences is about a year old, and represent proofs of concept rather than shipping products. In the case of the Oculus demo, that’s clear; while it takes advantage of ILM’s digital character models, it suffers from the same middling resolution and interface problems that any year-old Oculus experience does. But the iPad demo is something different, providing a glimpse at what true movie-quality, real-time computer graphics can make possible. On the first pass, I just watch the short like a traditionally shot and edited scene from a movie: some Stormtroopers on Tatooine are on a search, C-3PO and R2-D2 are in hiding, and eventually Boba Fett shows up for a big reveal. But the quality of the visuals is arresting. It doesn’t just look like a CG cutscene; from the quality of the motion to the sunlight glinting off the droids, it nearly looks like a movie shot on film that I’m watching on an iPad. And it’s not a simple video file being played back either; the footage is being rendered in real-time on an ILM server and then streamed to the tablet (ILM later tells me they’ve run successful tests over LTE, as well). With a tap I can slow down time, change perspective, or watch the entire scene from a Stormtrooper’s point of view. In another mode I can use the iPad as a virtual viewfinder, scoping around the world to see whatever I like, or even join the droids before they even appear in the edited version of the scene. Instant prequel. It’s all too easy to imagine going to a theater to see Episode VIII, then firing up an iPad to explore what happened just before some big climactic Sith showdown or lightsaber duel. ""Instead of cutting a scene because the running time is too long — or only getting to see that on the Blu-ray release as a special feature — what if there was a version where it’s more like, ‘I still want to tell that story, it would just be better in VR?’"" Bredow smiles. ""Let’s let this show as a parallel story, let’s release this clip with multiple things you can explore and give the audience something that they can sink their teeth into if they want to engage in the movie in that way."" If Bredow is the focused, technological wizard that brings the disparate parts of ILMxLab together, then the group’s blue-sky shaman is creative director John Gaeta. A visual effects legend in his own right, Gaeta was the person that invented bullet time for The Matrix, a film he credits for shaping his own philosophy about VR. ""The actual experience of The Matrix itself started expanding my thought on the very topic that the movie was about,"" he says. ""I joined that effort with the Wachowskis partly because I thought it was so well-written, how they considered virtual reality completely sublime. In the perfect state, it’s a flawless simulation."" Hearing Gaeta riff on the possibilities of entertainment in the future is like going through a portfolio of Syd Mead’s best futurist work: the ideas are wild and inspiring, with an air of inevitability about them no matter how far the reach. He sees a world where cinema becomes real-time and reactive, where audiences can virtually inhabit the worlds of their favorite characters and use them to tell their own tales, and where the the failure of today’s transmedia — ""it’s very antiseptic in a franchised way"" — is washed away in favor of an interconnected universe of story experiences that let audiences immerse themselves in a world to whatever degree they want. And it’s not as far away as you might think. ""Building block one is to allow people to understand that there is no longer a wall between cinema, or storytelling,"" he explains. ""It could just be the opening gateway, right? The portal."" It’s aspirational stuff, and as he riffs I notice the team shares an unexpected point of inspiration: Disneyland. ""Walt Disney believed that he could take a fantasy world from cinema that he was making, and basically create a physical experience that you could walk into,"" Gaeta says. ""This is like a 2.0, supercharged version of the same philosophy."" It makes sense; when you zoom out, Gaeta’s grand vision resembles nothing so much as a digital Disneyland, and Walt Disney Imagineering even has a satellite team embedded at ILM for working on Disneyland attractions. ""There’s a lot to be learned from those formats in the parks."" As we walk through Lucasfilm, Gaeta points out a particular floor. That, he says, is where the writers and directors of the new Star Wars movies work — and it’s a place he and Bredow visit regularly to give demos and conceive of experiences for movies that are still years away. ""We have this sort of bedrock underneath us, of evolving story over time that we can keep thinking about."" Gaeta says. ""So imagine going into story sessions in which you actually talk about something that could be happening eight years from now. Literally, we have these meetings, where we’re all, ‘Well, Moore’s law, plus these possible breaks, plus new inputs which seem to be evolving….’"" The trick of having the right technology, at the right time in the master Star Wars narrative, is constantly in question. In a way, that Star Wars floor — home of Lucasfilm’s Story Group — is xLab’s secret weapon. George Lucas’ space opera is more than just a series of movies at this point; it’s a cultural media platform unto itself, and it’s immensely important that all its disparate pieces fit together. Bredow tells me he reports to both the general manager for Lucasfilm and ILM, and head of development Kiri Hart. ""Specifically on the story side, Kiri has a real vision for how the Star Wars world should kind of reach out and be told through these different media,"" he says. Even something as minor as the iPad demo is made in concert with Hart’s team. As the Star Wars universe progresses and technology evolves, Lucasfilm’s hope is that the new mediums the lab is working on become viable outlets for Star Wars storylines and experiences — and in turn, new ways for audiences to consume. xLab could be the roadmap to no less than the future of franchised entertainment, something that is likely not lost on Disney’s CEO. ""Bob Iger sees the potential, and I think that’s why he’s really been willing to take a long-term view of this,"" says Vicki Beck, ILM executive in charge of strategic planning. By its very nature, something like xLab has to be a long-term investment; not only is there no business model in place for VR or AR experiences — Beck tells me they’ve discussed everything from freemium to subscription models — but there isn’t even consumer hardware for sale yet. In terms of diversification, however, the appeal for ILM is obvious. Visual effects is a notoriously tough business, with studios looking for quicker work at a cheaper price to such a degree that smaller companies like Rhythm & Hues have winked out of existence. These new mediums will allow ILM to repurpose the assets it creates for movies, wringing additional value out of them, and with many different types of xLab projects in development Bredow is bullish on his team’s prospects. ""We know that these foundational technologies have tons of applications,"" Bredow says. ""If AR ends up being huge and VR ends up being medium-sized, that works out just fine for us. We’ve got lots of plays in both. Even if we were to only leverage this technology for the filmmakers to be immersed in their environments, that’s really useful too."" That trickle-up effect is already happening. Director Gareth Edwards has been using an xLab Oculus Rift set-up to preview and tweak set designs for his upcoming film Star Wars: Rogue One, Bredow says. ""When he, two minutes into having the headset on, referred to it as ‘real life,’ I was like, ‘okay, we’re on to something here.’"" Bredow hopes to release some sort of xLab demo experience within the next six to 12 months — my money’s on a piece tied to The Force Awakens — but some of the group’s early work is already available for public consumption. The lab worked with filmmakers Felix & Paul for a Jurassic World VR tie-in, and also contributed to Warcraft: The Skies of Azeroth, which debuted during San Diego Comic-Con. But those are things VR dabblers are already familiar with: relatively static, on-rails experiences. Baby steps, necessary to introduce people to an entirely new medium, but nothing near what Gaeta and Bredow are really dreaming of… yet. ""What I’m talking about is being in the shoes of a character like you saw in the story,"" Gaeta tells me. ""I want to be in the X-Wing. I want to be piloting the AT-AT. Or be where the droids are hiding. We think those are experiences that are just one step deeper than consuming the story. And what’s wonderful about that is that once the destination is built you can wander around in it, you can be social in it, you can do other things. You can play in it.""

Tonight, a man in a red beret will appear on television. He’ll stand and watch as men and women scramble through mud, grit their teeth through a tug of war, and wade cautiously through a murky lake. They’ll also be cooking. The man is Alton Brown, and this is Camp Cutthroat, a spinoff of the Food Network’s sabotage-happy cooking competition Cutthroat Kitchen. It’s the most recent in a long line of cooking show spinoffs and the logical evolution of a format trying to stay relevant by making cooking more extreme. The overall format of the original Cutthroat Kitchen, which premiered in 2013, is standard for a cooking competition: three different dishes, three rounds of cooking, and one elimination after each round. At the start of each round, Brown holds an auction. The chefs are provided with $25,000 each to bid on items meant to make their competitors' lives more difficult. During one episode, a chef paid $4,400 to force a competitor to use blue cheese and red wine in his French toast. One chef paid $5,200 for the sole use of the kitchen knives; his competitors had to use scissors and a razor blade. Camp Cutthroat will follow the same format, but instead of taking place in a shiny television studio kitchen, it will all take place in the wilderness.  Cooking shows haven’t always been like this. There can be comfort in a cooking competition. It’s usually only noticeable for a brief moment; sometime after the challenge has been dealt and before the timer slides down to zero. The room is mostly silent except for the sounds of cooking (and maybe some dramatic mood music). The rapid march of a knife through an onion, the first sizzle of a slice of prosciutto dropped into a skillet of simmering oil, or the clatter of a fry basket scraping against the sides of a grease vat. The chefs are in their most comfortable place, and all you have to do is watch. Watching cooking shows felt like some approximation of love while we ate Seamless orders delivered in plastic bags. This kind of digital tenderness felt like enough for a few years, but familiarity breeds contempt. And there may be no breed of  television programming more in danger of falling victim to that than cooking competitions. In 2005, there were two cooking challenge shows on the Food Network. Last year, there were 16.  We passed peak saturation years ago, and then we kept going: Top Chef, Iron Chef, MasterChef, Hell’s Kitchen, Food Network Challenge, Chopped. Then came the spinoff tournaments: Top Chef Masters, MasterChef Jr., Iron Chef: America, Chopped Champions, and Food Network Star. They all had a smart-mouthed host and featured chefs with fast hands and something to prove. Somehow, these shows were captivating enough to prevent viewers from stopping to ask the question ""What’s so exciting about watching someone else cook food you can’t eat?"" At first, we didn’t need to know what made it exciting; we just knew that it was. But nearly a decade into the conception of televised cooking competitions, audiences can’t be trusted to be captivated by comfort anymore. There’s nothing interesting anymore about watching someone make the perfect balsamic reduction, and the Cutthroat Kitchen series understands that. How do you revive a stale format without throwing away everything that made it good in the first place?   Cutthroat Kitchen has already funneled through six seasons, a celebrity sabotage tournament for charity, and one Halloween super-competition of Cutthroat veterans. Over the past two years, things have gotten progressively stranger. If cooking shows are an approximation of love, then Cutthroat Kitchen’s recent episodes have been like a couple trying to reignite that feeling of infatuation from the start of their relationship. A recent episode had Brown auctioning off five shot glasses containing different ingredients: one of hot sauce, horseradish, Worcestershire sauce, fish sauce, and garlic. The sabotaged chef had to take a shot of one of the sauces each time he wanted to taste his food. Another chef was forced to wear a scuba mask and prepare scallops with his head underwater. Brown announced these challenges with a menacing laugh. If anyone could make torturing people seem like charming affection, he could, but he always seemed slightly uncomfortable with the villain persona. Since the beginning, Cutthroat Kitchen has been criticized for taking these gimmicks too far; that the show is less about the food and more about making people look silly. But that interpretation misunderstands challenge as distraction and mistakes simple dishes for amateur ones. The best challenges in the Cutthroat series aren’t about physical activity but culinary expertise, when the chefs are required to use strange and unappetizing ingredients in their dishes. In a first season episode, one chef is forced to make dessert macaroni and cheese, so he adds white chocolate to his cheese sauce. (He was eliminated, but his downfall was that he also put lobster in the dish.) In another episode, a chef is asked to make a turkey dinner without butter, so he decides to make an Asian fusion dish instead of something traditional. These innovations don’t always make for good food, but they make for good improvisation. And improv adds an element of the unexpected to one of the most predictable formats on television.   Reality TV has already tried to breathe new life into tired premises by making the boundaries as insane as possible, specifically, by throwing physical challenges into the mix. MTV’s Real World lifeline The Challenge asked Real World contestants to team up and compete in a series of bizarre battles. Bachelor Pad was a spinoff that similarly pitted former Bachelor contestants against each other to ridiculous effect.  And that idea has never worked for cooking shows, until Cutthroat Kitchen made it work. But Camp Cutthroat may be the limit, and obstacle courses are never a good sign. Early seasons in the Cutthroat universe mastered the delicate balancing act of comfort and strangeness, but with Camp Cutthroat, the series may have ditched that comfort entirely to make room for as much absurdity as possible. If cooking show competitions start to lean too far in one direction, they won’t be cooking shows anymore — they’ll just be boot camps with a food theme. And here’s something we often forget when we’re in love: novelty has an even shorter shelf life than comfort.

On the consumer side, we’ve run out of ideas; maybe we use them to watch video, “babysit” our kids, or travel with them when it’s too annoying to carry a laptop. On the business front, computer makers have been desperate to make tablets work, to the point where they’re creating half-laptop, hingey hybrid things — some with styluses.  Which puts tablet makers in a tough spot when it comes to upgrade cycles, because people aren’t buying new tablets nearly as often as they buy new smartphones. And yet, people have come to expect some of the impressive features that come with new smartphones.  That’s exactly the case with Samsung’s Galaxy Tab S2, which is an upgrade from last year’s Galaxy Tab S and is now the company’s newest flagship tablet.  The question, then, is whether or not the Tab S2 can play the role. It’s fast, it’s powerful, it’s svelte, it’s good-looking. Samsung has addressed some of the issues that consumers had with the previous Tab S, most notably that it was slow, and it had an aspect ratio that was ideal only for movie-watching. But there are still elements of the tablet that show little improvement from last year’s technology. I should talk about the tablet’s build first, since that is one area where it stands out. Tablets are like TV sitcom stars, slimming down almost inexplicably from season to season, and the Galaxy Tab S2 is ridiculously thin. In fact, at 5.6mm thin, Samsung says the Tab S2 is the world’s thinnest tablet, edging out both the iPad Air 2 and the Dell Venue 8 7000. And it’s light enough to forget I was even carrying it in my bag. The Tab S2 comes in two different sizes, a larger 9.7-inch tab and an 8-inch one. (Like iPad Mini, the 8-inch Tab S2 was just a little too wide for me to hold comfortably with one hand, but that, of course, will depend on your hand size.) The plastic back of the tablet, while prone to smudges, is wonderfully unembellished, and a metal frame accentuates its fancy feel. Its Super AMOLED display technically has lower pixel density than the display on last year’s Galaxy Tab S, with a resolution of 2048 x 1536. But the display on the S2 is still rich and vibrant, the difference indiscernible to the average eye. It now has a 4:3 aspect ratio, a welcome change from the 16:10 ""cinematic"" aspect ratio on last year’s Tab S, which was excellent for movie-watching and not much else. This time around it’s better for everyday stuff, like reading. At the low end of pricing, there’s the 8-inch, WiFi-only Tab S2, which comes with 32 gigabytes of internal storage for $399. The 9.7-inch, WiFi-only 32GB tab will run you $499. The LTE-equipped models, which are available through AT&T, Sprint, US Cellular, and T-Mobile, vary in price but get as high as $650; both tabs are expandable to 128GB with a microSD card. This puts this Tab firmly in at the high end of tablet pricing, which is what you would expect from a flagship, but there are some decidedly non-flagship elements to think about. First, it does have an upgraded Samsung Exynos processor (the 5433 quad-core), and for the most part I’ve multitasked and played graphics-heavy games on it without issue. But it’s the same processor found in last year’s Galaxy Note 4 smartphone, not the latest and greatest. Again, with expectations now being set by aggressive smartphone cycles, it’s hard to accept a top-flight tablet with old internals. It’s also shipping with an outdated version of Android — Lollipop 5.0.2 — though Samsung assures me it should be upgradable to 5.1.1., and that details on the next-gen Android OS will be available ""soon."" It has Samsung’s Touchwiz UI, which is fairly clean but still includes some Samsung-specific apps, like Milk Music. Many of the Tab’s other features will look or feel like old news to you if you’ve been using newer Samsung mobile devices. There’s a fast-working fingerprint scanner built into the home button. You can multitask by running, say, a YouTube video next to a completely different app. And a proprietary feature called SideSync that casts the interface of your Samsung mobile phone onto your tablet, so you can, for example, send a text message directly from the home screen of your tablet. Samsung is also touting a feature called Quick Connect, which, in theory, would let you throw video from the Tab S2 onto your TV — and vice versa. But to pull video from your TV, you have to have a specific model, the Samsung JS9500 (which, oh yeah, costs around $4,500). In order to go from Tab to TV, your TV has to be DNLA, Wi-Fi- and Bluetooth LE-compatible. My TV’s old school, so I couldn’t really test this. When I opened up Quick Connect on the Tab S2, it was only able to find my Sonos speakers. The tablet’s 8-megapixel rear and 2.1-megapixel front cameras are pretty much the same as last year’s Tab S, with a slightly wider aperture lens to let in more light. For people who like to take lots of pictures with your tablet (and I have yet to match your enthusiasm for such endeavors), you likely won’t be blown away by the photos, especially ones taken in low light. It records QHD video at 30 frames per second, although it doesn’t do 4K. Then there’s battery life. In our Verge battery test, which cycles one web page per minute, I got 6.5 hours out of the larger Tab S2 and about 15 minutes more out of the 8-inch Tab S2. With average use, it lasted about a day and a half. This falls short of what many other tablets are capable of these days, and the reason is obvious: it’s just so darn thin. The batteries in each of these tabs are, in fact, smaller than the batteries on last year’s Tab S. Does it have fast-charging capabilities? Nope. Wireless charging? Wishful thinking. Samsung’s explanation for all of these decisions around the Tab S2 is that it mostly expects this to be a ""living room device"" — which maybe also says something about how we’re all using (or not using) our tablets. Battery life, in this scenario, doesn’t matter as much; you can always plug in if it’s lying around the house. Samsung has updated its flagship tablet in areas where it needed it. Will it lure some consumers? Sure, if they happen to be on an upgrade cycle, really care about thinness or — oh yeah — are looking to pay $399 or more for a high-end Android tablet. And yet, I still don’t feel like it has that wow factor that gives tablets the push they really need.

At the time, Marshall was lauded for doing something different in the rather staid smartphone world (or rather, the Swedish firm Zound Industries was praised for not messing up the brand they'd licensed), but how does the London stand up to closer scrutiny? We had a play with the would-be rock'n'roll smartphone at IFA and found that while the handset is certainly not a disappointment, it's perhaps not the design tour-de-force some were hoping for. Overall, the look of the London is effective. Familiar tropes like the knurled scroll wheel of a volume knob, the tire-tread grip around the edge of the case, and the gold and red accents all contribute to a stylish — if clichéd — aesthetic. But taken individually, these elements aren't quite as impressive. The scroll wheel is just a little too loose and the cross-hatched grip is non-allergenic plastic, not leather. There's an optional case that adds a soft red fabric lining with slots for credit cards, and gives the device a bit more heft, but the regular back is a thin piece of plastic that clicks in and out and when tapped sounds every so slightly hollow. Basically, it feels like a smartphone. Perhaps it's my fault for expecting the device to have some of the feel of the heavy-as-a-rock amps that Marshall's reputation is founded on (and that features heavily in the London's marketing), but the phone just didn't have much presence.  But that's certainly not a terrible thing. The London is a smartphone, after all, not a speaker, and Zound Industries has certainly taken care with the device's functionality. Although the specs are nothing to call home about (a 4.7-inch 720p display, 2GB of RAM, 16GB storage, and an 8-megapixel camera), the company has deployed a barely-touched Android Lollipop OS that runs briskly, and the London certainly looks attractive compared to most of the market.  There are also some nice audio-orientated extras, like dual headphone jacks for sharing music and DJ'ing with your phone (not very rock'n'roll surely); a dedicated ""M"" button at the top of the device that gives you quick access to your music, a global equalizer, or an audio recorder; and dual front-facing speakers at the front of the smartphone. And while the device wouldn't survive long in a mosh pit, a line of white plastic piping around the display means it can be dropped on its front without going to pieces. Overall, the feel is of a practical device for people who just want something a little different in their pockets.

For the most part, Spotify wasn't really asking for that much, but it made the mistake of writing its privacy policy in legalese, leading to a lot of confusion; many other major services, like Instagram, have already learned that having incomprehensible service policies can lead exactly this kind of problem.  ""We hope it provides a healthy dose of clarity and context."" That's exactly what Spotify is rolling out today. Its new privacy policy is supposed to be a plain-language rewrite of the one introduced last month. It even includes a long introduction that's basically just Spotify outlining what it will and won't do with your data, as well as what types of data it collections and under what circumstances it'll share information. The privacy policy is still fairly dry — it is a privacy policy, after all — but it opens with an explainer that should ease many concerns. ""The introduction is intended to be a clear statement of our approach and principles about privacy,"" Spotify CEO Daniel Ek writes in a blog post. ""We hope it provides a healthy dose of clarity and context too."" Likely to spare itself any further trouble, Spotify says that anyone who already agreed to last month's privacy policy updates won't need to agree again to this one. For those who haven't agreed yet, this updated policy should be appearing ""in the coming days and weeks.""

By 2050, airborne pollen loads from the invasive species are projected to increase by a factor of four — largely due to climate change — pointing to what the paper's authors describe as an ""urgent"" need for action. The study, published in the journal Nature Climate Change, combines two models to predict the effects of climate change, land use, and seed dispersal on ragweed pollen levels across Europe. Using data on ragweed distribution collected from 1986 to 2005, the models show that pollen concentrations will increase significantly across Europe by 2050, with one-third of the increase due to seed dispersal, and the remaining two-thirds due to changes in climate and land use that will create more habitable terrain. Pollen concentrations are projected to increase substantially in north-central Europe, northern France, and the southern UK, where levels are currently negligible. In areas where pollen levels are already high, concentrations are projected to increase by up to a factor of two. A troubling outlook for allergy sufferers Common ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia) is a resilient, flowering plant native to North America, but it has spread across parts of Asia, South America, and much of Europe, where it was first introduced in the late 19th century. Since the 1940s, the highly allergenic plant has become entrenched across much of central and eastern Europe, and its pollen can travel long distances, causing itchy eyes, runny noses, and respiratory problems in susceptible individuals. It has also been shown to impact agriculture, with crop yields in some cases declining by more than 50 percent. A 2013 report from the EU estimated the combined economic losses from agriculture, work productivity, and health costs at €4.5 billion (nearly $5 billion). The findings published today paint a grim picture for the coming decades. Previous studies have suggested that climate change will allow ragweed to spread further north under warmer temperatures, while others modeled the spread of its pollen. But the paper published today is the first to use an integrated model to predict how its pollen could spread over the coming years under different climate scenarios, accounting for seed dispersal, pollen production, and pollen spread driven by wind.  Ambrosia artemisiifolia L. plant at the flowering growth stage. (Inra-Dijon) ""That's one of the really new things — that they've been able to take all these things into account,"" says Carsten Skjøth, an aerobiologist at the University of Worcester, who was not involved in today's study. ""Many of these previous climate change studies don't really take into account changes in local vegetation, because it's difficult. But they have done this."" The Balkans, Ukraine, and northern Italy could see pollen counts reach as high as 22,000 grains per cubic meter, according to the models. Today, counts in these regions can reach as high as 13,000 grains per cubic meter, but even counts of 2,000 grains are considered high for people susceptible to allergies. The rate at which seeds disperse will influence the magnitude of this increase over time, but the authors note that even if ragweed distribution were to remain unchanged, climate change would increase pollen loads across much of the continent. They speculate that this is likely due to rising CO2 levels that facilitate pollen release and drier conditions that are more conducive to airborne pollen transport. Daniel Chapman, a plant community ecologist at the Center for Ecology and Hydrology in Edinburgh, says that the projections should be taken with ""a pinch of salt"" because data on the distribution of ragweed plants across Europe is imprecise, and that the calibrations the authors used to account for this may not hold true over the coming years. But he also points to observed changes in the plant's biology that may also contribute to its spread into new areas. ""It's spreading all over the world. It's not just a European problem."" ""We know that ragweed is rapidly evolving as it's spreading through Europe,"" says Chapman, who was not involved in the study. ""Because of this rapid evolution, ragweed won't necessarily behave the same way in the future as it does now. It can behave differently in different places and adapt to local conditions, and it's very challenging to incorporate that into the model."" The study's authors acknowledge that the uncertainties surrounding the distribution of ragweed plants and the rate at which seeds may disperse, but experts agree that their overall predictions — increased pollen concentrations and newly invaded areas — are likely to hold true. Mitigating this scenario presents more difficult challenges. The plant is very resilient, often growing back after it's been removed, and its seeds and pollen can survive for decades. It also tends to grow along roadsides, where removal can be difficult, and treating it with traditional herbicides can impact nearby flora and fauna. And although the European Union has taken measures to limit its spread, experts say stronger action is needed — both within Europe, and beyond its borders. ""It is urgent to put in place European coordinated and integrated management programs,"" including ""eradication programs and public awareness campaigns,"" says Lynda Hamaoui-Laguel, a researcher at the Laboratoire des Sciences du Climat et de l'Environnement (LSCE) in France and one of the study's authors.

Before substances such as LSD were stigmatized during the ""war on drugs"" in the 1970s, studies suggested they could be useful in dealing with psychiatric disorders, writes James Rucker, a psychiatrist at King’s College London. But a number of restrictions —  some legal and some financial — have made studying potentially-helpful drugs far too difficult. ""Legal prohibition of some psychotropic substances continues to be a condition of UN membership,"" Rucker writes, ""even though the original reasons for classifying them as such were largely fallacious."" It costs $150,000 to produce one gram of legal psilocybin LSD and other psychedelics were classified as Schedule 1 drugs by the United Nations in 1971 — meaning their production and transportation is tightly controlled. For example, only one manufacturer in the world officially produces psilocybin for the ""prohibitive"" cost of $150,000 for one gram or 50 doses, Rucker writes. This means that ""clinical research using psychedelics is 5-10 times that of research into less restricted (but more harmful) drugs such as heroin."" LSD, first synthesized in a pharmaceuticals lab in 1938, was tested in number of clinical trials in the ‘50s and ‘60s. Although not all of these trials were rigorous by today’s standards, a 2012 analysis of those that were more studiously conducted suggests that the scientists were on to something. A number of small studies in recent years have added to the body of evidence, making claims for LSD’s effectiveness in helping to treat everything from obsessive compulsive disorder to cluster headaches. However, larger clinical studies that might offer more conclusive evidence are impossible because of the ""practical, financial, and bureaucratic obstacles,"" Rucker writes. ""Unpredictability makes them dangerous."" But for all the apparent potential of psychedelics, many scientists argue that the drugs are just too risky to be used in a clinical setting. ""[Their] unpredictability makes them particularly dangerous,"" says Bertha Madras, a psychobiologist at Harvard University, in an email to The Verge. ""Hallucinogens can produce perceptual distortions of reality and also intense emotional swings."" This can lead to intense feelings of terror, panic, and the fear of insanity and death, Madras says. The review that Rucker cites as showing little evidence that psychedelics cause harm in controlled settings is from 1984 and ""much more has been added to the literature of hallucinogens since that time,"" Madras adds. Similarly, she notes that although controlled settings may reduce the more extreme consequences of using hallucinogens, we can’t predict ""that introducing this class of drugs as a therapeutic will not result in their misuse subsequently."" Madras says that Rucker’s assertion that the stigmatization of hallucinogens was politically motivated is ""pure drivel,"" and that ""politics [entered] the scene following alarms set off by health care professionals."" Despite the possible dangers of these drugs and the often fierce nature of the culture wars surrounding their image, it does seem like the tide might be slowly turning. The first studies on the medical use of LSD since the 1970s are now being published, and in the US, the swing of support for medical marijuana in recent years has shown that even the most maligned drugs can be rehabilitated over time. David Nutt, a drugs experts who was controversially sacked by the UK government after claiming that horse-riding was more dangerous than ecstasy, told The Guardian  in March that psychedelics offer ""the greatest opportunity we have in mental health,"" adding, ""There’s little else on the horizon.""",0.5798473485943046,0.42015265140569535,0.8409587770035291,596,5.4983221476510069,355,6.7802816901408454,0,0,"Policy & Law, Science, US & World"

Since the craft is self-inflated, it would be light enough to stay aloft with little to no energy, but still be maneuverable enough to navigate Venus' significant atmospheric winds and durable enough to withstand the sulfuric acid in the atmosphere. The VAMP is designed for NASA's New Frontiers program, which looks for innovative approaches to space exploration. If NASA likes the craft enough to fund it, the VAMP could be exploring the clouds of Venus in just 10 years. Many in the space industry are already seeing Venus as a more practical alternative to Mars exploration. The planet is typically closer than Mars, thanks to a more convenient orbital cycle, making exploratory missions significantly simpler. The surface of the planet is uninhabitable, hot and dense enough to melt lead, but a settlement floating in Venus' clouds would find temperatures, pressures, and radiation levels remarkably similar to Earth. A plane built for the clouds of Venus The most comprehensive mission to Venus came in 2005, when the European Space Agency launched a scientific probe called the Venus Express. At the end of last year, scientists at NASA's Systems Analysis and Concepts Directorate proposed solar-powered blimps as a way for humans to establish permanent settlements in the Venusian clouds. The system was called the High Altitude Venus Operational Concept, or HAVOC for short. ""The vast majority of people, when they hear the idea of going to Venus and exploring, think of the surface, where it’s hot enough to melt lead and the pressure is the same as if you were almost a mile underneath the ocean,"" HAVOC engineer Chris Jones told IEEE in December. ""I think that not many people have gone and looked at the relatively much more hospitable atmosphere and how you might tackle operating there for a while.""  Northrop Grumman's proposed craft would be more like the Venus Express than HAVOC, gathering scientific measurements rather than hosting live humans. But the VAMP would reach deeper into Venus' atmosphere than the Express did, gathering more information and providing crucial practical experience in how to outfit a craft to survive in Venus' unique atmosphere. Still, without NASA support, the VAMP is still only a concept, and we won't know whether agency wants to fund the project until it announces the New Frontiers mission next year.",0.5365189871538036,0.46348101284619636,0.2045537005324403,419,5.186157517899761,255,6.1333333333333337,0,0,"Science, Space"

Around 700,000 people a year currently die from drug-resistant infections, but a study carried out for the UK government last year by former Goldman Sachs chief Jim O’Neill suggested this figure could rise to 10 million by the year 2050, costing the global economy up to $100 trillion in the process. Part of the difficulty of fighting AMR is encouraging pharmaceutical companies to develop new drugs. Because antibiotics are only taken for short amounts of time and are sold at relatively low prices, they represent a bad investment for companies, not actually making a profit until 23 years after they're created.

""To my knowledge, there is one ongoing study on the skin of a limited number of astronauts having spent a few months on the ISS, and one publication dealing with skin in mice having spent 10 days in microgravity,"" says Betty Nusgens, a connective tissue researcher at the University of Liege in Belgium, and a co-author of the study published today in Microgravity. And so far, only one astronaut, Thomas Reiter, has had his skin examined after a prolonged orbital mission. In short, studying how skin reacts in Space is pretty new. In the study, six mice — known as ""astromice"" — were housed in a controlled environment on the International Space Station for three months. That may not seem like a long time, but three months for a mouse is equivalent to about nine to 10 years in humans. During the same period, another set of mice were housed on Earth, so that they could act as a comparison group. The study become much smaller, however, after three of the animals aboard the ISS died. The mice that died were frozen until they could be examined. Back on Earth, scientists killed three mice that corresponded to the ones that died aboard the ISS. They, too, were frozen and examined once all the animals were back on our planet. significant reduction in the thickness of the dermis In just three months, the astromice experienced a significant reduction in the thickness of the dermis, the middle layer of the skin, compared with the mice that stayed on Earth. This change resembled what happens to mammals in old age, the researchers say. In addition, genes involved in muscle contraction and development became more active in the muscle that underlies the skin — a type of muscle that has largely become functionless in humans over evolutionary time. Finally, a microscopic analysis showed that hairs that should have been in the final ""resting"" phase of the hair growth cycle remained in the ""active"" growth phase for far longer than normal. ""The effects on hair cycle were totally unexpected,"" Nusgens says. This type of change might seem minor, but the cells that enable hair growth are stem cells — cells that have the ability to turn into different types of specialized cells depending on where they are located in the body. If the stem cells involved in hair growth were affected by the space environment, then it’s possible that other stem cells, in other parts of the body, may have been as well. ""This would deserve more attention in the future because of the critical significance of stem cells in almost any aspect of biology,"" Nusgens says. ""The effects on hair cycle were totally unexpected."" The fact that only three mice survived their stay in space dampens the study’s impact considerably. If more mice had been included in the study from the start, it would be a lot easier to argue that the results from the skin analysis aren’t just a fluke. ""Even though we have multiplied the various analyses on several pieces of skin to increase the number of ‘technical’ replicates, the number of ‘biological’ replicates is unfortunately too low and does not fit with the statistical guidelines that are used in biology in ‘on Earth’ experiments,"" Nusgens says. And because the experiment is so unique, it’s ""very unlikely"" that researchers will be able to replicate it any time soon, she says. That’s why the study should be regarded as a ""warning signal to the space policy makers"" who plan long-term missions. The study can’t be used to make any definitive pronouncements about the effects of reduced gravity on skin, but it can spur more research. Skin is the largest organ in the human body after all.",0.1733811206358128,0.8266188793641872,0.8397892372714827,740,4.9581081081081084,369,6.2330623306233059,1,0,"Science, Report"

Japan accepted the challenge, and with the date of the duel now slated for summer 2016, Team USA (aka MegaBots Inc.) wants the public's money to make it sure it doesn't get tossed on the scrapheap in the first round. The company has set up a Kickstarter to raise funds for an upgrade to its robot, setting $500,000 as its minimum target and adding stretch goals of up to $1.5 million for extra melee weapons, balancing algorithms, and even new life support systems, to be designed in collaboration with NASA. ""We want to build the most patriotic robot ever."" The ultimate aim is to construct the ""People's Robot,"" say the company's co-founders Gui Cavalcanti, Matt Oehrlein, and Brinkely Warren. ""If we tried to take money from investors or from any other source it would be like we would have to do this, and this, and that, and make it look like the following brands and so on,"" Cavalcanti tells The Verge. ""We want to build the most patriotic robot ever and we’re going to be silly with it in ways that make investors a little uncomfortable."" He adds that while previous iterations of MegaBots' robot were put together on a ""shoestring budget,"" this time the team wants to go all-out to ensure that the project lives up to its hype and delivers the sort of spectacle people want to see. ""We’ve assembled this team of super high-end technology companies,"" says Cavalcanti. ""This is their full time job, they are literally the best in their field [...] so we need to be able to pay them — they don’t just do this stuff for free.""  Concept art for the fully-upgraded Mk.II. (MegaBots)  After the base level target of $500,000 for new treads, power units, and armor, the team is looking to hit four stretch goals for the Mk. II, each costing an additional $250,000. The first is for extra weaponry, the second for balancing algorithms, the third for life support systems, and the fourth to give the robot a ""Hollywood-grade artistic look and feel."" As well as hopefully working with NASA for life support, the team has plans to collaborate with IHMC Robotics (which came second place in this year's DARPA Robotics Challenge) to develop a self-balancing control system. ""That's going to basically transform us into a 12,000 pound, 15-foot tall Segway,"" says Cavalcanti. ""It's this really cool opportunity to bring industries together."" The team says that although the project's running theme of ""Fuck Yeah, America"" started as marketing tool for the initial challenge video (which was published just before July 4th), it's now become a serious endeavor. ""We have all these amazing partners who are leading their fields and willing to play ball,"" says Oehrlein. ""It’s this really cool opportunity to bring industries together and to show our country what it’s capable of. And that’s really meaningful for us."" MegaBots has a lot of work ahead of them though, starting with meeting its funding goals. An earlier pitch by the company last year to create ""the sport of the future"" — a giant robot fighting league — failed after only raising a little over $65,000 of its $1.8 million funding goal. The team have had to scale back their ambitions, removing the walking element of the bots (""realistically we don’t have time,"" says Cavalcanti) and concentrating on a duel rather than a whole league.  Concept art for modular weapon upgrades, including a pair of boxing arms nicknamed ""Stars and Stripes."" (MegaBots)  They've also got to hash out rules for the duel with Suidobashi Industries, the Japanese team which unveiled its own four-ton mech back in 2012. MegaBots says they can't reveal anything about the location or exact rules (nothing has been finalized yet) but they stressed that both sides ""want to see the robots get beat up and destroyed,"" adding: ""Rest assured there will be destruction and the rules will support that."" ""If Jay Z gave us 50 million dollars to be the pilot we’d take the money."" If the funding and the duel are successful though, MegaBots has a ""five year plan"" to develop an international tournament that they promise will blend the ""technology of Formula 1 with the fights of UFC."" They say they've already been approached by a team from South Korea and are confident that once they've got robot that can ""punch a Prius hanging from a crane"" there will be more interest from investors. So far there have only been talks, no solid deals, but they're open to offers. ""If Jay Z gave us 50 million dollars to be like 'I'm gonna be the pilot’ we’d take the money,"" says Oehrlein. ""Jay Z fighting in a giant robot: what's more American than that?"" Right now, MegaBots is just concentrating on the goal ahead of them: building a robot that's more than just a ""glorified bulldozer"" and that can give the public their first taste of real giant robot fighting. ""I think we combine very joking attitudes with very serious hardware,"" say Cavalcanti. ""We walk down the aisle in capes and aviators and people are like ‘who are these fuckers?' but then we round the corner and there’s actually a 12,000 pound robot sitting there.""",0.6133895725950651,0.3866104274049349,0.8512549965783914,903,4.8095238095238093,485,5.8886597938144334,0,4,"Culture, Tech"

Fossil fuel, regardless of price, is falling out of favor. Young people don't want to own cars as badly as they used to. Services like Uber and Lyft are upending the notion of personal transportation altogether. That makes Mike Tinskey's job a particularly interesting one. Tinskey is Ford's global director of electrification and infrastructure — that is to say, it's on him to make sure electric cars and hybrids get into customers' hands and work well for them. He's also heavily involved with some of Ford's future mobility projects — the suite of forward-looking ideas cast by Ford CEO Mark Fields at CES earlier this year — which means he's got a very full schedule, indeed. I had a chance to speak with Tinskey before a panel at the Tribeca Film Festival this week, where he was planning to talk about future trends in transportation. We met at a nearby coffee shop in the heart of Manhattan, one of the most car-unfriendly locales in the world.   Chris Ziegler: If you could just give me an overview of the projects that you’re responsible for? Mike Tinskey: Yeah, so, I like to describe my role as a bit of the clean tech. It’s a very interesting-sounding title. I was intrigued. My title is Global Director of Vehicle Electrification and Infrastructure. It really reflects the roots of my group, which is, ""how do we make our electric vehicles successful around the world?"" So that’s where we really started — how do we work with the grid operators, how do we integrate our vehicles, how do we get the standards, how do we get the charge station into the customers’ garages. And then the group grew, and we really started to focus on mobility and sustainability. So I’m actually part of a group called Sustainability — so think about all the things you do in a vehicle that waste time or energy… finding parking or car-sharing programs and how can we make those more efficient? How can we recharge an electric vehicle faster? How do we attack some of these challenging mobility challenges that are hitting us? Cities like [New York] that are growing, and the number of magnet cities in the world are actually increasing. So what my group does is both advanced projects and current solutions that solve alternative fuel, electrification, and mobility solutions. So not strictly EVs? No, no. So yeah, what I’ll talk about [at the Tribeca Film Festival] is a couple of those projects that we’re doing, which are mobility related. So for example, say, if you had to carry on your back the amount of energy that you use, what does that look like over time? From the 1800s to now? And what is in that backpack — is it wood or coal? So I’ll be talking a little bit about how that’s evolved over time and how renewables have really impacted what you would have in your backpack and the challenges that come with that, too. How can we, as a vehicle manufacturer, help solve some of the grid challenges that come from that? So that’s kind of the Cliff’s Notes version. So Toyota, just about an hour ago, put out another big push on the Mirai, which I’m sure you’re familiar with. I know that hydrogen is a very controversial topic, even in the alternative fuel world, and if I’m not mistaken at one time Ford had a fuel cell program, maybe on the Focus? Many years ago. I’m wondering, what happened to that, and what’s Ford’s current view of hydrogen in general? Yeah, so, Ford is very much in the ""power of choice"" camp, where we will take a single platform and we’ll offer it in multiple powertrains. And we’ll let the customers tell us what works for them. And so, a great example is, say, the Ford Focus. We offer it as a diesel in Europe, we offer it in gasoline here, in pure electric here, and the customer can tell us what works for them. And that’s our approach. So when you talk about hydrogen and how does it fit, we very much take a similar view. We have an active partnership with Daimler and Nissan to develop a fuel cell. We’re doing a lot of our research work up in a lab we have in Vancouver. The challenge with fuel cells isn’t necessarily in the stack; it’s really infrastructure related. How do you get the hydrogen produced and distributed economically to make them viable? So if there’s some public-private partnerships and infrastructure and it becomes more viable, I think that will be the tipping point of whether or not hydrogen will be successful. So speaking of infrastructure, what’s the state of the art with fast charging? Is [fragmentation of standards] a concern for you? Where do you stand on that? Well, if you look at it today, you’re right, there’s a lot of vying for who’s going to have the future standard. You have CHAdeMO, you have Supercharger, and you have combo or SAE, which is all the other automakers. If you were to map out the number of electric vehicles or plug-in vehicles that are going to have each connector, I think you’d quickly find that the combo connector will be the most widely supported. So we’re bullish on that coupler, and we’re fully supporting it. But what’s happening is something that’s pretty interesting — if you were to rewind a couple years ago, we were talking about battery swapping because you can’t charge the batteries fast enough, and we’re seeing — in fact, we’re even doing an experiment on how fast can we charge. So one of our mobility projects is how quickly can we get energy into a lithium ion battery, and what is the limit of that. And what are the limits of the infrastructure? In other words, what will the utilities allow us to provide during peak times? And frankly, that whole space is moving so quickly that I think that very soon — say, next-generation products — we’re going to see 150 kilowatts. So today, you’ll go out and find a fast charger and it might be 40 kilowatts, maybe 50 kilowatts. I think in the very near future you’re going to see 150 kilowatts. And even some automakers are talking about going further than 150. On the same connector? On one connector, yeah. The same connector because it has enough metal to support the higher power. It was really the lithium ion battery at the other end that was the bottleneck. And then the utilities were concerned about drawing that kind of power. So I think what you’re going to see is… I think battery swapping is much, much less likely now. Fast charging is becoming much more fast, high-power. And I think you’re going to see an emergence of these next-generation vehicles become much more capable and then have this fast-charge network that can charge them very quickly so that theoretically the battery electric vehicle doesn’t become a second or third vehicle, it becomes perhaps a primary vehicle. And we’re talking 200-, 300-mile range on these vehicles? Yeah, I mean, Ford hasn’t announced our plans, but many manufacturers have announced the next-generation products, and those are coming in with much higher range than their current products. So think about that scenario where you have a BEV that can get those kinds of ranges in an area like Manhattan, that’s plenty of range for your inner city. But if you wanted to go from here to Boston or what have you, now we’re starting to think that you can recharge in 20 minutes, and you can put the stations strategically along freeways, and you end up with a very impactful combination. And that’s 0 to 100 percent? That’s 0 to 80 percent. What happens, as you probably know, after 80 percent we have to back off the charging. You can still keep going, but it’s longer time. So it’s like, what, a couple hours for a full charge? No, no. On a fast charger? No, it’s 20 minutes to 80, then maybe 35 or 40 minutes to get a full charge. But if you were looking at your value of time, you get the most value by going to 80 percent and then going to the next station. And so the concerns with utilities have been smoothed over? No, I would stay there’s still a lot of work to do. There’s this thing called demand charges, I don’t know if you’ve ever heard of that. It’s a charge that the utility will pay, and if for just one second you’re using a certain amount of power, you’re charged for the whole month at that level. So the ability to use that power. It’s called a demand charge. And these can be thousands of dollars per month. Even just to have access to the power. So we have to work on that because we’ve got to make it… Some utilities are very progressive and they’ve reduced or eliminated their demand charges for electric vehicle charging, and others are not so progressive. Talking about these extremely hot, in-demand chargers, I’ve heard several anecdotes now, particularly in California about charger rage. EVs have become successful enough now so that demand significantly outstrips supply for the chargers, especially during the day. Is that something that you’ve looked at at all? Any creative ways to solve that? So all of our plug-in vehicles have an embedded modem. So when the customer downloads the app, the data is aggregated so we can see how our customers are using the vehicles in terms of charging. And well over 90 percent of them are using home charging, or I guess I should just say nighttime charging. We’re assuming it’s home, but it’s all aggregated, so I don’t know if it is their home. But the point is, this nighttime charging is getting them to where they want to go. So if you look at the order of importance on standard charging, it’s home, then workplace, and then public. And the public is just a couple percent of customers, and frankly, that number’s been going down because what’s happened is those chargers used to be free and now business have enabled to pay for it, and usage has really… I think people were using a lot of those stations because they were free. So, I guess the bottom line is, we’re really putting our focus on home and workplace, and then we’re now talking about how do we work as an industry to do this fast charging and get fast charging out there. Have you found that the dramatic decline in gasoline prices has sort of shifted your priorities at all? You mentioned that you’re not just working on EVs, but you’re also working on conventional solutions. I think that in our industry, the deflated fuel prices, we view as a short-term phenomenon. So it hasn’t really impacted any of our long-term strategies. We know where we need to be in the future, and we also know that electrification is probably one of our key enablers in our toolbox, so really our strategy has to change. I do think that our plug-in hybrids are continuing to do really well, and there are a lot of reasons for that. I mean, if you look at a city like this where you have stop-and-go traffic, you’ve got idle times because of congestion or lights, the plug-in hybrid is a great product. And it’s driven all of our accessories into electric. So our air conditioner compressor is electric, so you get all the creature comforts, and your engine’s not running. You’re just drawing the minimum amount of power you need. And so we’re really seeing that. And every time you stop, that energy’s going back into the battery with [regenerative] braking. So those products I just see proliferating even more.      Is there a lot of technology sharing between those groups? Between the hybrid group and the EV group? Or are they very independent projects? In fact, they’re one group. Hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and battery electric vehicle group is all one group. And the same teams launch all those technologies. I’m assuming that you’re very tightly integrated with the announcements at CES this year, which were sort of bonkers future visions. I like that, ""bonkers."" [Laughter.] It’s interesting to see how tightly integrated Ford has become with CES, which was not an auto show at all 10 years ago, and now it’s the auto show to kick off the year. But they were all very non-conventional announcements, right? So talk a little bit about those and what you’re most excited about and what you’re most heavily engaged in right now. What’s the nearest-term to being a real commercial product? If you were there, you heard sort of the background on why we’re doing these experiments, right? There are 25, and it’s driven a lot by urbanization and changing consumer interest, growing middle class. So those are the pillars. A couple of the experiments that were highlighted there that my group’s actually working on is, one’s called Parking Spotter. So you can imagine as cars are driving down the street right here in front of this shop, they’re able, with an existing sensor on the sides — we have a parking assist that helps you park the vehicle. What we’ve done is create a parking database of all parking in the United States. Just the locations. And one of our prototype vehicles is in one of those locations and driving less than 10 miles per hour, we enable both left and right sensors, so essentially it becomes a probe — a parking probe. So when it drives down a street like this, we’re mapping ""occupied, not occupied, not occupied,"" and then we’re putting it in the cloud for our other customers. So you might want to call it crowdsourced parking. Infrastructure is very expensive for parking… if you were to put sensors, the traditional ultrasonic sensors cost $500 or $600 per spot. If you were to use cameras, you might be in the $200 to $300 per spot range. And so this technology, which is already on our vehicles, is almost essentially a freebie because it’s just software. So that one’s really interesting… we’ve got a vehicle running down at Georgia Tech that’s testing in all different types of lots, angled parking, parallel parking, back-in parking, front-in parking, and we’ve been really happy with the results. And so that’s something that will be coming to production vehicles? Well, no, we’re not that far. So we’re going to go into pilot stage — we’re going to put it on several vehicles, in fact we’re going to ask customers that already have this parking assist feature on their vehicle, we’re going to see if they want to participate. And it’s basically a software change on their vehicle, and then they become probes, and we’ll see how that goes. And then we’ll see where we go from there. But the concept is very sound, right? If you can get all the vehicles looking at parking as they’re driving around, and you get real-time maps, I think it could do a lot for both CO2 from an emissions standpoint, [and] congestion would go down because you know what happens when you’re looking for parking, right? You’re driving slower, you’re distracted. So it can really be a big improvement there. And that’s a feature where it seems like a rising tide raises all ships. If you share that data with other automakers and they share with you, everybody wins. So have you had discussions with any industry groups? Well, that’s a really good question. I think the answer is we’re trying to find the right business model. How do we all work together? What does it look like? Is it a third party that aggregates it for us? So I don’t know… we haven’t approached other OEMs yet. We obviously patented the technology, but we haven’t quite figured out what we’re going to do and how we’re going to package it. But to be a little more specific, 2014 was to prove its viability from a technology standpoint, and like I said we’re very pleased. 2015 is, alright, how do we take it to the next level? And that’s where we’re at right now. Last year, I got a Ford demo at CES of the [vehicle-to-vehicle] stuff, which I thought was very interesting. And that’s getting closer to be a regulatory thing. So is that something that you’re doing anything with? Because I know there are several levels of functionality there. That’s right. And connectivity in general is going to be great. V2V is going to be there. As you said, it’s regulatory. But we have to get infrastructure in place, which is once again regulated. So we’re going to see it. One of the other projects that you may have seen at CES is called Remote Repositioning. I’m bridging a little bit to that one, because I think it also answers some of your questions… so the history there is, we noticed car sharing and all of these... Zipcar types of arrangements were becoming more prevalent. In Paris, or maybe even here, the Citibikes, my guess is there’s a truck that goes around at night and puts them back in the right spots. So in Paris there’s the same thing. So we said, isn’t there a technology solution to that? So what we did was we said, what can a cellular network do — you know, your typical AT&T LTE network — and can we put a driver in a vehicle remotely and move those vehicles around at night to get ready for the next day of sharing? And so we recreated in a laboratory three screens, four cameras on the vehicle, we used a golf cart as a surrogate, using just production networks, and we could drive that vehicle from across the country and put it where we want and almost replicate the experience just as if you were in the driver’s seat. So that one is really interesting to me for a couple reasons. One, it can help put the repositioning at nighttime hours. Two, it could be a virtual valet, so even like in front of here, we could’ve gotten out and then a call center could’ve taken the vehicle and put it in a parking space, so you don’t have to get wet [from the rain] or you don’t have to go hunting for a parking space. Or the other use case that we’re pretty excited about, we’ve been pretty open about our autonomous plans, and that technology is moving and we know we’re going to have it on vehicles in the near future, but we don’t think policy is moving as fast. So perhaps a remote driver during certain conditions or in certain states or in certain areas could augment autonomous. So you’re saying that from the driver’s perspective, the car will be self-driving, but really there’s someone else driving it from afar for them? That’s right. If you’ve ever had the pleasure to go to, for instance, China, if you’re not aggressive to try to turn left, there will be people that will walk in front of you all day long. And an autonomous vehicle would end up sitting there forever. And a driver normally just has to kind of say, ""Alright, I’m going,"" and the people will stop and the car heads through. So there are going to be situations where a remote driver can actually pilot a vehicle better than an autonomous in certain conditions. Or just because of policy, that might be the way that we have to deal with it. So Remote Repositioning is kind of neat because we’re using existing cellular networks, we’re using existing vehicle technology. The cameras are just production cameras, and you can be anywhere in the world. You can assign yourself to this vehicle for five or 10 minutes and put it where it needs to be, link up with the next one, et cetera. So we’re quite encouraged with that one as well. To what extent are you getting pushback over privacy and security concerns? On that one in particular, but more broadly with any upstream data from the car. Yeah, so, Ford, you heard this at CES right? Ford has this policy that it’s your data, we’re shepherds of that data, but it’s the customer’s data. We have these privacy principles, and our goal is to be leaders and be good shepherds of the data. We haven’t, frankly, gotten any pushback from our customers. Everything is spelled out and they opt in, et cetera. But we’ve been very careful and we intend to continue to be very careful with how we manage and how we aggregate and how we put in all the mechanisms that we think are necessary to produce that. So in the case that we just talked about, Remote Repositioning, not only are we using bank-level encryption on that data, but the way we would implement that if we were to go into production would have multiple safeguards. For example, we would never let Remote Repositioning happen unless the customer selects it within their shifter, right? So if the customer is just driving their vehicle down the road, that module isn’t even enabled. Well, but there’s an obvious counter to that, which is that it would be an amazing tool for vehicle recovery, if a vehicle is stolen, right? [Laughter.] Yeah, there’s one. Yeah, we haven’t even thought about that use case. And then you have to think about is the privacy and security risk worth the trade-off. That’s right. And we’ve always erred on the conservative side. So yeah, I think we have got — I think the whole industry, not just the auto industry still has a lot to learn on that. I mean, the amount of data that is being potentially shepherded, it grows so quickly. And it’s still the Wild West. It still feels like it’s the young days here where networks are just now becoming mature enough to support this stuff. Yep.     One thing that I thought was very interesting from the CES announcements is that a lot of this is focused on non-traditional business models for the auto industry in general, meaning, potentially you’re not selling as many cars because you’re working on ride sharing and car sharing — things where people don’t have to own cars anymore. To what extent is that a concern for you, and how are you alleviating those concerns? Yeah, it’s a really good point. At this function I’m at, I was just speaking to a few people, obviously all New York City folks, I asked them how did they get here today. I didn’t find a single person who drove their own car. So if you use this as a bit of the trend, you know, we have to change. We have to offer multi-modal mobility solutions, right? One person took a subway to a bus. There wasn’t a car in that person’s route. So that’s why we’re doing the experiments, is to really just understand — especially the millennials, how much their attitudes are changing. How smartphone usage is increasing, how the ability for them to find or share their vehicle. Their appetite to share their vehicle is over 50 percent of people we’ve surveyed, where somebody in my generation, I would be [less likely to share my vehicle]. So if we don’t embrace these trends… we’re definitely on the embracing side. And I’m assuming, maybe this isn’t true, but I would imagine this breakdown is very different between urban, suburban, and rural environments, right? It is. And if you look at it from the technology solutions, once again, going back to our electrifications, we find our plug-in hybrids are fitting our suburban commuter really well. In fact, we did this really interesting experiment where we offered our employees a really good rate on a plug-in hybrid, it was just over a year ago. We had a lot of takers. And we had data, so we knew how often they were driving in electric versus gas mode. And the bottom line is they were driving three out of every four trips in electric mode. They were driving four trips on average per day. But they were driving that last trip every day on gasoline. Just because their battery was depleted at that point? That’s right. We have a 19-mile battery in that product, the C-Max Energi. Then we put workplace charging in, and lo and behold, we find that Monday through Friday is all-electric. So they’ve got that fourth trip now on electric. So I guess what I’m getting at is it’s just interesting to see how in different segments, and where I come from it’s a lot of suburban commuters, they’re getting everything they need from that electric, and they’re getting it from very low-cost, very clean electricity. We just installed a big solar array on the back of our world headquarters that’s powering 28 charge stations. That’s going to be commissioned very soon this summer. So, you know, the whole way we do transportation is not only what we’re driving, but where the energy is coming from; [it's] really evolving. To what extent is Ford engaged on that end of it, how the energy gets made? So I guess you would say we’re pretty engaged. From a personal level, so if you had a home and you wanted to put solar on it, we have a partnership with SunPower where you can get a discount if you bought a Ford plug-in. You get a discount on solar, so we call it ""EV plus PV"" — electric vehicle plus photovoltaic. So that’s sort of a partnership we did. The other thing we do is, utilities, electricity tends to be cleaner at night, believe it or not. A lot of hydro in the US, it flows at a higher percentage at night. Wind blows stronger at night. So if you look at percent renewables by time of day, generally the nighttime hours are a little bit cleaner. So if you make that assumption, utilities are trying to do time-of-use rates, so you would pay a different rate during the day than you would pay at night, so we created this big database we call Value Charging. And we know that if you put in your zip code and you’re on a time-of-use rate, we know the hours when you get the lower rate, which tends to be cleaner. It’s generally 11PM to 6AM, or midnight to 6AM. So the database knows that, so if you come home from work and plug in, it doesn’t start charging until those lower rates. So we do that type of work, and then we work with utilities quite a bit to understand if they have a feed they can give our customers — if they have a lot of renewable, we can put it into our app and notify our customer. We call it our green app. They can say, I only want to charge when the electricity is the greenest. We give them that option as well. I’m assuming you have some data on this — I don’t know how much you’re able to share — at what point is the crossover where we’re selling over 50 percent alternative fuel vehicles, hybrids, and electrics? Is that coming soon? We don’t really talk publicly about it, and I think part of it is there’s a lot of unknowns, meaning fuel prices and all the other things. What I can say is, one, if you look at our portfolio over time — so we’ve got what we call the power choice. We’ve got our EcoBoost, which is our downsized, turbocharged, direct injection. Then we have all of our electrification, so that’s battery electrics, plug-in hybrids, and hybrids, and then we have our natural gas and alternative type fuels. If you look at that portfolio over time, one of the biggest factors that we’re going to have to do is recapture braking energy and shut down engines during congestion, lights, start-stop, that kind of thing. So you start adding up where we have to take the product portfolio in the future, electrification is going to be a big element of it. And when we cross 50 percent? I don’t really know. I can tell you right now we’re only running about 3 or 4 percent electrified products, and that number’s dipped down about a full percentage point since fuel prices have fallen. So we’re still in the early days, but I think we’re going to see an acceleration here in the next couple years. All manufacturers are likely going to embrace it, because it’s in everybody’s toolbox and it’s the right thing to do for fuel economy. Is that acceleration driven by economies of scale? As you have more of these vehicles, the difference in price between the gasoline model and the hybrid model goes down? That’s right. There’s a big part of that. I mean, battery prices in general. Power and electronics are the other big piece in terms of the cost. So if we can get scale on the battery side, if we can get the price points down, then you’re going to see it. I don’t know if you had an opportunity to get to the Detroit show this year, but I think you probably saw the trend… plug-in hybrids were everywhere. And I think you’ll continue to see that. In fact, one of the things I like to tell people is if you look at the history of Ford’s electrification — we’ve done electric vehicles before, but our mainstream products. Our first hybrid was the 2004 Ford Hybrid Escape. And if we look at that hybrid it was a 3-liter engine, it had a very small battery. And that was co-developed with Toyota, right? No, that was a Ford-only product. A lot of people think that, but it was a Ford-only product. If you go to our second generation of hybrids, they went down to a 2.5-liter engine — this was the last generation — and then they had a nickel metal hydride battery that was just under a kilowatt-hour. So a little bigger battery, different technology in that it had a smaller engine. And then you come to our current generation of product, we’re at a 2-liter — so it went down another half-liter — and we went to lithium ion. And we went just over one kilowatt-hour. And our plug-in hybrid we went to about an eight kilowatt-hour, and then our battery electric we went to about a 23 kilowatt-hour. So if you call that a trend, the engine’s getting smaller and smaller, and the electric motor and capability is getting bigger and bigger. So if you were extrapolating that out, if that was a trend, you can start to see that our plug-in hybrids are becoming more electric. And that’s sort of the evolution that I’m predicting is happening, because Americans need their freedom. They really want to be able to go on their weekend trips, they really want to go far distances. But during the week, if they can get everything on electric, that’s a fantastic compromise. So I think we’re going to see an evolution on that side. And you talked about battery manufacturing scale. Are you actively bumping into those limits? Gigafactory’s gotten a lot of press over the past year, and obviously it’s a huge constraint for an all-electric vehicle, but is that a problem for you, and if so, how are you addressing it? I can’t really comment directly on Tesla’s strategy, but I would say this: there’s a breakpoint that we all will get if we can collectively get the volumes. So there’s no surprise here that our Focus Electric is using the same cells as the Chevy Volt, we use the same supplier. A123? No, it’s called LG Chem. Holland, Michigan is the plant. So, just think about under that scenario, if those volumes grow and that supplier is able to collectively get the volumes, then we all will enjoy the same scale. So what I’m expecting to happen in the industry is, you know, there will be the Tesla strategy — stationary plus vehicle and put it all under one roof and produce a lot of them — and then there’s basically going to be our strategy, which is find the best-priced cell and battery pack that we can and let the supplier get the volume and scale by going across the industry. And I really think that it’s worked for us many times, and that’s how the supply base works, and so I think it’ll be an interesting few years to see how it all pans out, but we’re very confident in our strategy. So Ford has the Focus Electric, and then you have products like the Prius, where it’s a dedicated hybrid line. So you have two strategies there, one is take an existing vehicle and put in a different drivetrain, versus a line of products. Would Ford ever consider making a dedicated EV or strong hybrid product that sort of showcases the most advanced EV technology available, and just sort of put it out there as flagship EV product? It’s a good question. Let me back up and explain our current strategy, which, as you stated, we take our global platform and then have different powertrains in it, and that’s worked really well for us. For example, in this climate right now, when we’ve seen deflated fuel prices, we have seen a shift back for some customers buying traditional powertrains. And so that strategy works really well, we can adjust our manufacturing mix based on the customer pull. But to your point and to the future, I can’t really comment specifically, but I do think that we’re going to see more electrified products come to market. We just saw the Continental concept launch. I was surprised at what a small engine was in a big car, but it was just a gasoline engine, I believe, not a hybrid. Can you scale electrification up through your largest vehicles, both sedans and SUVs, trucks? Could you have a hybrid Explorer or Expedition, or F-150? Well, I mean, technically, the answer’s yes. The question is whether you can get a viable business case. Can you provide all the customer attributes of towing and everything that you want? So I can’t really talk about our future products, but I can tell you that if you look at lightweighting now, if you look at what else can we do to get to where we need to be for fuel economy and do our part for the planet, electrification is where everything is likely going to have to go. So I think it’s one of our strongest tools in our toolbox, and so… stay tuned.

And, yes, there was some weird stuff, too. Volvo ditched the front passenger seat for its new concept, and Chevy made something akin a giant blender blade. Let's take a look at some of the major reveals of the show — and when you're done, be sure to read up on our hands-on experience with Mini's crazy Augmented Vision goggles.  McLaren 540C. The slightly less powerful cousin of the 570S introduced a few weeks ago in New York, the 540C features a 533hp twin turbo V8 that's good for 0-62 in 3.5 seconds. Starting price: £126,000 (about $189,500). Honda Concept D. Words fail the Concept D; you just have to look at it for yourself. When it goes on sale in China, it'll be Honda's top-of-the-line model for the local market. Don't expect to see this one in Europe or North America. Audi Prologue Allroad. Audi has been teasing its new Prologue design language since the sedan's debut at LA last year; this is the third variant. Audi's Allroad models are ruggedized, raised wagons, but you wouldn't know it by looking at the Prologue Allroad unless you compared it side-by-side with the Prologue Avant. Chevrolet FNR. Designed by GM's Shanghai-based studio, this is Chevy's take on an autonomous car of the future, with front seats that swivel 180 degrees to face the rear passengers. Ford Taurus. This is the first time a Taurus has been offered in China, and as with many Chinese-market cars, this one is focused on rear-passenger comfort with features like power reclining. It's not exactly like the next Taurus for the US, but it's in the same family. Mini Augmented Vision. Think Google Glass for your car: that's the basic idea behind Augmented Vision, developed in collaboration with Qualcomm. These goggles allow the driver to see speed limits, points of interest, navigation commands, and so on. We even had a chance to try them recently. Volvo Lounge Console.As with many China-focused auto announcements, the Lounge Console is focused on rear passengers, since many Chinese customers prefer to be chauffeured. Demonstrated inside an XC90, the Lounge Console replaces the front passenger seat with an ottoman that includes a storage compartment, a 17-inch television, and a mirror. Cadillac CT6 plug-in hybrid. Expanding on the CT6 announcement in New York, Cadillac announced a plug-in hybrid version of the car at Shanghai that promises double the fuel economy. (Impressive, if true.) It pairs two motors with a turbocharged 2.0-liter four. Mercedes-Benz GLC Coupe concept. BMW pulled this not-quite-SUV vehicle category out of thin air a few years ago with the X6, and Mercedes is unapologetically chasing it now — first with the GLE, and now with the downsized GLC. The company calls this a ""concept,"" but it's very close to the production model that will go on sale in the coming year.

The Phantom Limelight Collection — a run of 25 specially-fitted Phantoms — was ""conceived for that select group of people who spend their lives in the public eye and on the world stage,"" the company says in a press release. That starts with the rear doors, which have been fitted with special compartments: on the ladies' side, room for jewelry, on the men's side, a concealed space for watches. Both sides have room for three fragrances in handmade bottles imported from France's Bresle Valley: one each for morning, midday, and evening. I'm not aware of anyone who changes their fragrance depending on the time of day, but then again, I'm not a billionaire socialite. The Limelight also debuts a new type of rear seat for the Phantom that's apparently been optimized for relaxation through consultation with medical professionals, featuring a motorized calf rest, a 27-degree incline, and foot rests that pop out of the car's floor. Naturally, the car features Rolls-Royce's trademark Starlight headliner, which uses fiber optics to create a star pattern above the passengers. (Specced separately, it's a five-figure option.) You can choose the Limelight in one of two color schemes — Light and Dark — but as with any Roller, money talks; you can most definitely have it your way, as long as the price is right.

It had made a diagnostic tool for figuring out what was wrong with a car and what parts were needed to fix it — but according to a lawsuit, they had done it by infringing on Ford's own diagnostic software. The smoking gun was a list of Ford car parts, stored in encrypted form in Ford's dealership tools, and uncovered within Autel's diagnostics. The list itself was useless — it was just a bunch of car parts — but it was copyrighted material, and prying it loose meant breaking through Ford's own digital protections, a violation of the notorious Digital Millennium Copyright Act. In the process of trying to build a diagnostic tool, the mechanics had accidentally run afoul of copyright law. Many details of the suit are still unclear — did Autel take more than just the list? how much did their tool really borrow from Ford’s work? — but what’s striking is how thoroughly the deck is stacked against them. Simply accessing the code was a crime. It was copyrighted material, the property of the manufacturer, and tinkering with it was both difficult and illegal. Simply accessing the code was a crime It's a growing danger, as cars are increasingly reliant on an array of powerful processors and proprietary software. But copyright activists are pushing back against the idea in a new round of legal wrangling, claiming a fundamental right to tinker with that software, the same way an earlier generation of enthusiasts might tinker with a carburetor. Car companies have pushed back against the idea, citing safety and emissions regulations, but the fight is already raising fundamental questions of ownership in the digital age. If you can't control what happens under the hood, do you really own your car at all? The fight is centered around a set of proposed exceptions to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. Every three years, groups can propose such exceptions based on non-infringing uses that might otherwise be covered under the act. This time around, the EFF filed for two auto exemptions: one covering ""diagnosis, repair, and modification"" and another covering security research. (There was also a general ""security research"" exception, something vulnerability researchers have long been asking for.) If the exceptions are granted, it would be more than just a protection for companies like Autel. It would mean prying open the black box of car software, giving the driver new rights over the car's onboard processor. ""Code brings with it this whole legal doctrine that was created for different content."" In some sense, this is an old fight. For decades, automakers have tried to steer drivers toward dealership-based repairs, and for decades some drivers have resisted that pull, preferring to work on their rides at home and in third-party shops. But the computerization of the modern automobile has upset that balance, thanks to the unique legal status of software. It's possible to patent a car's transmission system (companies do it all the time), but it’s hard. It has to be a truly unique transmission system, and even then there will be years of applications and filings at the patent office. But copyrighting the software for an electronic transmission system is easy, and it gives companies a huge advantage in locking out third-party repair shops. Aggressive copyright laws like the DMCA compound that advantage, giving grounds to prosecute anyone who breaks through the car company's digital protections. ""Code brings with it this whole legal doctrine that was created for different content,"" says the EFF's Kit Walsh, who's working on the exemptions. ""The default has shifted dramatically in favor of the manufacturer."" Cars have also become less tinker-friendly for basic mechanical reasons. Open up the hood of a modern car and you’re likely to find a plastic cover, physically preventing the driver from doing much more than checking the oil. Telematics systems mean even physical fixes like changing a tire often require coordination with the protected central computer. There have been some bright spots — like new systems for pulling data from OBD ports — but the overall trend is clear: cars are becoming less accessible and more opaque. The EFF claims would be a chance to fight back, through the same process that made it legal to unlock an iPhone. These exemptions are more narrow than the phone-unlocking measures, but they raise many of the same fundamental issues of ownership. ""It's the same basic principle,"" says Walsh. ""If you own something, you ought to be able to see what code is running in it and modify that code."" ""If you own something, you ought to be able to see what code is running in it and modify that code."" At the same time, would-be car hackers may have bigger problems than just copyright law. Cars already exist in a web of laws and regulations, many of which are enforced through the car's processors. As General Motors points out in its rebuttal to the EFF, a driver that tinkers with a car's emissions systems or airbags might end up breaking EPA guidelines or car safety laws. There’s also the liability issue: if a hacked car ends up crashing because of bad brakes, the manufacturer could still be on the hook for a lawsuit. Many of those decisions are currently being made not by drivers or car companies but by the federal government — and for automakers, complying with those decisions means keeping control of the car's core electronics. As a result, some in the auto industry favor a split system, in which systems like entertainment and telematics are left open while safety and emissions systems are locked down. Mike Tinskey, who directs Ford’s electric car and infrastructure projects, says he understands the nostalgia for mechanical tinkering and thinks there’s a way to preserve it as cars go electronic. ""I think there's a whole set of things that can be customizable and a whole set of non-touchables,"" Tinksey says. ""And we've essentially set the architecture of our vehicle up that way today. So you can access the CAN bus [the internal network that coordinates a car’s various systems], but you can't change, say, the transmission strategy."" That customizable realm is usually where software platforms like Android Auto live, but tinkerers hoping for a deeper reach into the car's systems may end up being left in the cold. Still, the most immediate concern for drivers is whether the DMCA will lock them out of their onboard computers entirely, and whether companies like Autel will still be accused of infringement for building on top of an automaker's platform. The Librarian of Congress will decide later this year whether EFF’s exemptions should be approved, but the larger issues will probably be fought out for years to come.

In a short film called Fueled by Bullsh*t, an engineer collects a bunch of cow manure from a farmer, turns it into hydrogen, then uses it to drive off in a Mirai.

The Mirai goes to market just as next-gen plug-in electric cars are about to make a splash at significantly lower price points than the models available today: Tesla's Model 3 and Chevrolet's Bolt will offer over 200 miles of range for well under $40,000, and neither one will require hydrogen stations that don't exist today.

A report from car buying service Edmunds says that in the first three months of 2015, there was a noticeable uptick in electric and hybrid car owners trading in their high-efficiency vehicles for traditional, fossil fuel SUVs. The number stands at 22 percent, Edmunds claims, up from about 18.8 percent during the same period last year and 12 percent three years ago. In other words, just because you buy a fuel-efficient vehicle once doesn't mean you've necessarily bought into the Prius and Tesla lifestyle forever — and that loyalty is actually falling over time. Many drivers buy electrics and hybrids for the environmental benefit, but for others, it's a simple, cold calculation: taking into account the difference in cost between a hybrid model and its non-hybrid stablemate, how long will it take to start saving money? As Edmunds notes in its report, pricy hybrids made for a more compelling case when gas was over $4 a gallon, because heavy drivers could realistically recoup their money within a few years. At today's average — under $2.50 a gallon, according to AAA's tracker — it would take far longer.  This trend probably isn't hurting Tesla Edmunds reports that sales of EVs and hybrids are generally down, representing 2.7 percent of total new car sales this year versus 3.3 percent the year prior, which can probably also be attributed to the lower price of gasoline. The report doesn't break down loyalty by specific model, but it's likely that Tesla — where the premium price of the Model S precludes buyers who are primarily concerned with saving on fuel costs — isn't being hurt by the trend. Hybrids are likely the biggest victims, followed by inexpensive, lower-range EVs that compete with commuter cars (Nissan's Leaf and Ford's Focus Electric, for instance). The decision to move all the way up to an SUV, though, is a little puzzling.

It is, essentially, a car for millennials. Paul Venhovens, who leads the Deep Orange program, said the concept vehicle was ""about creating a better value proposition for young adults that have little money to spare, less interest in vehicle ownership than previous generations, yet need a personal mobility solution that aligns with their complex lifestyle."" In service of that ""complex"" lifestyle, the Deep Orange 5 can be turned into something of a lounge, with its four chairs flipped to face each other, and the door swung open to let the chill vibes in. The concept vehicle also features digital displays that let driver and passenger watch separate outputs and post messages, opening up the possibility of watching Netflix or posting Twitter updates while on the road.

Stewart Reed, the chair of California's Art Center College of Design Transportation Design, said the CU-ICAR students had ""really immersed themselves into the personas of youth living in urban settings while designing this vehicle."" The result is light, using a carbon fiber body to make getting around a city easier, and more ecologically considerate than most cars — the students projected that a final model would use a natural gas engine, and built space into the chassis to contain it. Deep Orange 5 is — as the name suggests — the CU-ICAR's fifth-generation concept car. Previous entries in the series were developed in partnership with other car manufacturers, including BMW and Mazda, while future entries are already in the works with companies such as Toyota. The Deep Orange 5 might not ever see active production, but General Motors might take some of its lessons on board — give it a few years and we might see groups of hypebeasts chilling on roadsides in their swag new millennial-mobiles.

It’s the unifying metaphor behind Google’s new design direction, providing a unified set of physics and rules for how software should look and act. It’s also a little weird. The design team at Google felt the need to come up with a more coherent look and feel that could be applied across all of its products, from Android to Chrome OS to the web. Rather than starting with a palette of colors or a big set of guidelines, they started with a question. What is software made of? The answer came from a design exploration, when Jon Wiley, principal designer for search, and his colleague Nicholas Jitkoff were looking at the now-ubiquitous cards that Google started using in Google Now. They looked at those sliding cards and wondered: when you swiped one away, what was underneath?  ""It's colorful in a way that the logo is colorful."" ""It sounds like such an innocent question,"" Duarte says, ""and yet it was such a powerful spark."" It led the team to come up with a new way of thinking about the software elements we use and (virtually) touch every day. Instead of just talking about pixels on a screen or abstract layers, the team imagined that these cards and the surfaces they slid around on were actually real, tangible objects. If these cards were an actual material with its own physical properties, that would mean there would be rules for how they must act and move on the screen. You couldn’t do anything you wanted with them, just like you can’t just do anything with physical objects. So the team set about creating this metaphorical material, which is a little bit like magical paper. It’s flat, it floats slightly above the surface of the background, it tends to be white. There are consistent drop shadows, and a consistent light source illuminating them. Things tend to not just vanish when you move them, but slide away. They don’t shuffle around on their own, but only move when a user moves them. Combined with the decision to move towards bolder, brighter color choices and larger typography, the material and the look of it were the seeds from which the rest of the design grew. You can see the first implementation of it in Android L: it has a variety of colors and sheets that slide around and over each other, but still give you a sense of place and consistency. Wiley and Jitkoff say that this new aesthetic is more of an evolution of Google’s design philosophy than an about-face. In 2012 and 2013, Google embarked on a design initiative called Project Kennedy, which began the process of unifying design across the company. Now, with Material Design, it’s about moving it forward. ""As a whole the platform conveys this feeling of polychromacy,"" Jitkoff says, ""it’s colorful in a way that the logo is colorful, it’s simple in a way that the front page is simple.""  Material Design ""unified us in our thinking,"" Duarte says, admitting that ""it’s absolutely a constraint."" These constraints, he says, made design decisions easier and more consistent. Take, for example, the idea of flipping a card over to see what’s on the back. In Material Design’s world, that’s a cheat that doesn’t work. It’s as if the software is actual, physical stuff inside these devices, and there’s not space inside a phone to flip a card over, so Google doesn’t allow itself to do it. We’re hardwired to comprehend physical things, Duarte says, and software all too often behaves in ways that break with our models and expectations. Wiley thinks of it as breaking the suspension of disbelief, as when something happens in a sci-fi movie that doesn’t follow its own internal logic. Duarte is a little more direct, with a subtle dig at Apple’s iOS and its flying software layers: ""We’re not hurtling you through space at high speeds,"" he says. ""We’re not puncturing your hand with invisible, impossible surfaces."" ""Design is all about finding solutions within constraints,"" Duarte says, ""If there were no constraints, it’s not design — it’s art."" ""Design is all about finding solutions within constraints."" Google’s designers steadfastly refuse to name the new fictional material, a decision that simultaneously gives them more flexibility and adds a level of metaphysical mysticism to the substance. That’s also important because while this material follows some physical rules, it doesn’t fall into the old trap of skeuomorphism. The material isn’t a one-to-one imitation of physical paper, but instead it’s ""magical,"" as Duarte puts it. It can do things that physical paper can’t, like grow and shrink with animations. Those animations were important to Google, because they help users understand where they are inside an app. ""A lot of software … kind of feels like television or film in terms of jump cuts,"" Wiley says, causing you to lose your sense of time and place. For apps, you want something more akin to a stage play. ""It’s going from one moment to the next,"" he says, ""that scene change, and what’s happening onstage is choreographed and transitioned, and there’s meaning."" The other, more important thing that this material can do is appear when you need it. Google has been working on the algorithms behind products like Google Now for years, and it’s become an essential part of this new design philosophy. Instead of asking users to manage their data, Material Design is asking users to trust that Google will show them what they need at the right time. ""With watches, you don’t want to spend a lot of time interacting with it."" That’s why the Android Wear smartwatch software doesn’t give users the ability to do much except respond to notifications. Alex Faaborg, the designer for the platform, says, ""With watches, you don’t want to spend a lot of time interacting with it. You just want to be able to glance down and see information and quickly do a voice command."" He says it’s ""in the same spirit as a lot of the work that we did for Google now, but it’s for the entire platform."" That’s a lot of trust to put into Google and into its magical paper material, but Duarte says there’s a reason for that. ""We did it in order to come up with the most simple solution. One of the design practices that we like to follow is try to design the simplest possible thing for the user first. See if you can get away with that, prove that you need more complexity before you add it.""  There’s more ambition behind Material Design than just bringing a consistent look and feel across Google’s software and webpages. It’s bigger than Android L, bigger than Android Wear. It’s about the relationship between the metaphors we use to think about computers and the technologies we use to interact with them. Material Design is about much more than Android Duarte points to ""the brilliant work that Xerox Parc did with windows that could overlap and mice that point and click, [it was] groundbreaking."" But it wasn’t groundbreaking because it was a virtualized version of a real desktop, but instead because it ""had object relationships."" That meant that people could form a model of how the world of the computer worked and make sense of it. Apple did a similar thing with touchscreens, moving us past point-and-click to a world where we could directly touch and swipe elements. Now Google believes it has a software design model that moves us forward yet again. Wiley points to the multiplicity of input technologies we have available to us today: touchscreens, gestures, voice commands, even Google’s own intelligent algorithms. They all need to combine to give our brains a model of how software works, one that functions across devices to help us intuitively interact with anything we encounter. Material Design is the framework that Google believes creates that model. It’s too much to say that it’s as revolutionary as Xerox’s desktop model or even Apple’s iPhone. But it does seem to have the necessary combination of simplicity and flexibility to help us make sense of the new technologies that we’re being assaulted with every day. And if Google can actually make good on its promise to implement it across the web, Chrome OS, and Android, it will help us transition between them without having to reorient our cognitive models of what software is and how it works. Right now, Material Design is only just an idea, and it will remain as fictive as the mystical substance it’s based on until Google actually ships more software that uses it. But as Wiley points out, ""We’re at the very beginning of this."" And Google is busy setting itself up for whatever comes next. ""What if we could design for the materials of the future instead of the materials of today?"" Duarte asks. ""That future is right around the corner.""",0.6666977622903455,0.3333022377096545,0.17684002078720099,1530,4.8882352941176475,660,6.2469696969696971,1,0,

This isn't the first time that The Hunger Games' marketing team has attempted to bridge the gap between reality and fiction. Last year saw the release of an intricate, fashion-themed website called Capitol Couture that entwined fake interviews with sly nods to the second film in the series, Catching Fire. Much like the world in the movies, the promotional material has changed in tone. Instead of designer labels, the glossy new images are branded with nationalistic slogans like ""our future is in your hands,"" and ""Panem Today, Panem Tomorrow, Panem Forever."" Every representative is dressed in a manner symbolic of their home regions, which are each responsible for a different industry. The Livestock District's Felix Stam, for example, is lushly garbed in thick, dark furs and pictured with a serene-looking goat.  The details in the posters are magnificent yet disquieting, hinting at the socio-political issues afflicting the fictional nation. In spite of the ostensible honor of their positions, none of the ""District Heroes"" smile. Most stare impassively at the camera, some glower. The most haunting photo belongs to Lily Elsington, the six-year-old ambassador from District 12.  On the Capitol's website, she is described as ""ready, willing, and eager to fuel the Panem of tomorrow."" But the unhappy, soot-glazed ragamuffin displayed in the accompanying image looks anything but that.

This year’s convention featured a number of diversity-focused panels aimed at women and people of color in media, startups, and engineering, along with, ideally, those charged with hiring them. The panels are all too necessary; in the last year, several notable Silicon Valley companies released diversity reports detailing the racial and gender makeup of their staffs. The findings were almost uniformly dismal. SXSW overall has received some criticism in the past for failing to highlight difference, so the event is making strides for the better. That said, it has also become a case study in how much things still need to improve industry-wide. ""We still have a ways to go."" South by, like Silicon Valley, has long been a party where most of the guests look and behave the same. That’s slowly changing. ""We’ve been working on this diversity stuff for a long while,"" SXSW Interactive director Hugh Forrest told The Verge. ""Firstly, I would say we’ve tried to get more women speakers involved. More recently, we’ve pushed to get more black speakers involved, [as well as] Latino speakers."" Forrest stated that, while there has only been a slight increase in programming aimed at under-represented groups this year, the convention has worked to improve their overall visibility. ""We feel like we’ve made some progress here, but we still have a ways to go."" That there’s ""a ways to go"" is self-evident at SXSW Interactive, creating a sense of tension between what has and hasn’t been done to address the problem. As far as progress is concerned, Forrest remarked that diversity panels that were once shunted off to hotel ballrooms away from the Austin Convention Center are now more centrally located. At one such panel, Facebook outlined how it aims to improve engagement with minorities to better grow brand opportunities for its ad partners. ""From an advertising perspective, more and more advertisers are focusing on effectively reaching multicultural audiences,"" said Facebook’s head of US multicultural sales Christian Martinez. ""They are recognizing the sheer size of these audiences, their engagement with digital platforms, and their buying power.""   Just as Facebook and other companies are creating initiatives for diversity’s sake, work is being done here at SXSWi. However, at a convention that’s still overwhelmingly white and features panelists that tend to skew white, cis, and male, the need for more and different voices is felt now more than ever. Of the 30,000 festival attendees in Austin, MVMT50 founder Donell Creech told The Root that he estimates there being between a paltry 500 and 1,000 black registrants at the conference. Organizations like MVMT50, a coalition of black thinkers in tech, want to see the number of black and brown women and men at SXSW improve. But getting them in the room isn’t enough. Integrating rather than placating ""What is the intention behind the attention?"" asked Natalia Oberti Noguera, founder and CEO of angel investing bootcamp Pipeline Fellowship, in a question that echoed director Ava DuVernay's own words from earlier that day. For her, it’s more than just having diversity panels. It’s a combination of being visible on both panels and boardrooms, while also encouraging the white men in power to engage in diversity discussions constructively. ""My hope is that these diversity conversations [are] going to be integrated into the larger ecosystem,"" she said, ""versus it being a move to placate us. Us being marginalized voices. Oftentimes the people who should be listening to us and hearing the conversations in these spaces are the allies."" Doing the work to become an ally — that is, being sensitive to issues concerning those that don’t share your experience — is harder than just creating a venue for the issues to be discussed. The act of encouraging panels for marginalized groups, while a necessary step in the right direction, doesn’t inherently foster conversation with the group in power. And as we saw with Eric Schmidt on Monday, acknowledging that there is a problem doesn’t mean that the problem is fully understood or that the unspoken biases that allow for a man to speak over a woman have been overridden. ""I’m really tired of seeing women who are put on panels to talk about being a woman in tech,"" Alexa Scordato, director of product marketing at Stack Exchange, told International Business Times. ""I want to see a woman in tech who’s talking about technology, not talking about diversity."" The next step in fixing the problem might then be recalibrating where, when, and how the exchanges about diversity take place. According to Meredith Clark, an assistant professor of journalism at the University of North Texas, the exchanges need to be foundational for any organization. ""I’m finding that the best way isn’t necessarily conversation,"" she said. ""It’s very pointed questions, and asking people in groups from their inception, at the very building blocks of what they’re trying to do, ‘Okay, who’s not at the table and why?’"" ""The best way isn't necessarily conversation. It's very pointed questions."" Asking those questions (like, How do we reverse the pattern matching that keeps straight white men in charge? How do we address tokenism? How do we close the pay gap?) needs to happen early for the kinds of startups that might find their future at SXSW. But for established entities, now is the time that they should be asked often. Not at conferences, but in offices everyday. It’s not enough to support the cause. Diversity touches all aspects of tech, so there can be no excuse not to consider marginalized groups as producers or consumers. Unfortunately — and especially as the industry observes the ongoing Ellen Pao trial — that’s a slow and painful process. When asked about SXSW’s internal diversity, director Hugh Forrest was candid in that the organization’s numbers are probably as bad as the rest of the industry’s. ""We’re trying to improve like they’re trying to improve,"" he said. ""It’s a long road there."" Aiming to improve is always a good thing, especially in the iterative world of technology, and companies are paying attention. The hard part, as always, comes in finding the right answers to the hard questions.",0.631623472068165,0.36837652793183495,0.7946770447246755,1045,5.1626794258373208,570,6.3807017543859645,0,2,"Business, Culture, Tech, Report, SXSW 2015"

Governor Chris Christie signed into law a bill this afternoon that reversed last year's ban. The new legislation comes with some limits. Tesla can only open a total of four direct sale dealerships and has to operate at least one service center. But it's a major win following a heated war of words that saw Tesla CEO Elon Musk compare local dealers to a mafia protection racket subverting the democratic process. A huge victory in New Jersey for consumer choice: We are open for business! @GovChristie  New Jersey represented the fourth largest market for luxury automobiles — like Tesla's Model S, which can tip the scales past $100,000 — trailing only New York, Florida, and California. So it's a key win for the electric car company. Bans on direct sales have kept Tesla out of Virginia, Arizona, Texas, and Michigan. Legislators in some of those states are working on legislation similar to the reversal just passed by Christie. Musk has argued in the past that direct sales are key to building out a fledgling industry. ""We strongly believe it is vital to introduce our own vehicles to the market because electric cars are still a relatively new technology. This model is not just a matter of selling more cars and providing optimum consumer choice for Americans, but it is also about educating consumers about the benefits of going electric, which is central to our mission to accelerate the shift to sustainable transportation, a new paradigm in automotive technology."" Local auto dealers saw things differently. ""If you’re an internet billionaire, maybe you think the world revolves around you, and the world springs from your laptop,"" Jim Appleton, the president of the New Jersey Coalition of Automobile Retailers, told The Verge last year. ""Well, I got news for him. This is not a new law, Tesla is operating illegally, and as of April 1st, they will be out of business unless they decide to open a franchise.""

In total, streaming services were responsible for $1.87 billion in revenue, compared to CDs' $1.85 billion. Those streaming services include subscription options like Spotify, radio models like Pandora, as well as other platforms like YouTube and Vevo. Though it was only by a slight margin this year, the trend is clear: streaming services are moving toward the top of the industry, while CDs continue to fall. The figures were released this week by the RIAA.  ""Record companies are now digital music firms."" While streaming services were able to take down CDs, they were still beaten by physical formats as a whole. Physical sales were still responsible for 32 percent of music industry revenue last year, while streaming services brought in 27 percent. Digital downloads remain bigger than both of them, at 37 percent. That figure has been dropping, however, as streaming services move in to take their place. ""Record companies are now digital music firms, earning more than two-thirds of their revenues from a variety of digital formats,"" Cary Sherman, CEO of the RIAA, writes in a blog post discussing the figures. The RIAA says that overall music industry revenues have remained flat for the past few years, despite how revenue sources have continued to shuffle around. CDs were replaced by digital downloads long ago, but now digital downloads are slowing, and it looks like it may not be long before streaming replaces them. While physical shipments as a whole are also shrinking, there is one area that they continued to see a bump: vinyl, which had revenues nearly double year over year. As streaming continues to grow, the discussion around how those services pay artists will only get louder. Even the RIAA is chiming in on it. ""Streaming music has been the subject of a healthy debate, which is appropriate,"" Sherman writes. ""...But the reality is that the consumer has spoken and this is what fans want. The entire music community must come together to help make these services work for fans, artists, and the music industry.""

(This is erroneous: the program was actually created under Ronald Reagan.) Republicans have already moved to crack down on the Lifeline phone program in some parts of the country, claiming that it's rife with fraud. But while the FCC has indeed moved to mollify those concerns, the crackdown in some parts of the country has been detrimental to poor Americans relying on the program. With that backdrop, it may not be too surprising that Republicans were ready to criticize the move, as National Journal reports. Senate Commerce Committee Chairman John Thune has already called the program an example of ""waste, fraud, abuse, and a pervasive lack of accountability,"" according to the Journal, while Sen. David Vitter said the ""FCC has failed to manage Lifeline efficiently in its current form, and I cannot support any expansion of a program that has so few safeguards in place to protect the legitimacy of the program and the American taxpayers who pay into it."" That's surely a disappointment to the FCC, which was hoping to get Republicans on board with the plan by only allowing people to put the existing phone credit toward broadband service instead of directly expanding the program, while providing checks to prevent abuse.

The issue came to light after the moderator of the controversial 8chan forum — an off-shoot of 4chan that has been criticized for acting as an ""active pedophile network"" — reported that the site had been the target of multiple DoS attacks from Hola's network. ""[Hola] recently ... realized that they basically have a 9 million IP strong botnet on their hands, and they began selling access to this botnet,"" says a note on the site. ""An attacker used the Luminati network to send thousands of legitimate-looking [requests to 8chan] in 30 seconds, representing a 100x spike over peak traffic."" Hola is able to act as a botnet for the same reason that its service is free: it doesn't provide its own bandwidth or servers, but simply redirects that of its users'. Most virtual private networks (VPNs) have their own servers spread around the world, channeling a users' internet connection through these so that it appears to be coming from a different country. This allows a user in France, for example, to watch geoblocked TV shows from the US. Hola, however, operates as a peer-to-peer VPN, routing users' connections through each other's devices like a giant telephone exchange. Hola makes money by selling idle bandwidth from its free users under the Luminati brand. Users who don't want to contribute their bandwidth have to pay $5 a month explains the site's FAQ.   Hola's founder Ofer Vilenski has said that the site has ""always made it clear"" how this business model works, but Hola's users seem to have been almost universally unaware that their bandwidth was being sold off. A thread on Reddit discussing the news is full of commenters expressing their outrage and surprise. ""I've had it for years,"" writes one commenter, ""fuck knows who has been using my internet connection!! And for what?!"" Even users who might have taken the time to read Hola's FAQ could have been misled — TorrentFreak alleges that the site ""only recently"" added details explaining the role of the Luminati service to its site. The worry for some users is not only that Hola has been leeching their bandwidth, but that their connection might have been used for illegal purposes — accessing anything from copyrighted content to images of child abuse. In the case of the DoS against 8chan, Hola's Vilenski has said that the attacker ""could have used any commercial VPN network, but chose to do so with ours"" and has now had their account ""terminated."" Hola's millions of users, though, might not be comforted by this news.

Those charges came with a 20-year minimum sentence but no possibility of the death penalty, making life in prison the harshest possible sentence. That's exactly the punishment that Judge Katherine Forrest decided upon, though she admitted it was a ""very, very difficult"" call to make. Her ruling leaves Ulbricht without any hope of parole. Barring a successful appeal, Ulbricht, 31, will die behind bars. Judge Forrest described Silk Road as ""an assault on the public health of our communities."" According to Motherboard, the judge launched into an unforgiving teardown of Ulbricht's character as she revealed he'd be locked away for life. ""You are no better a person than any other drug dealer. Your education doesn't make you different, and makes this more inexplicable,"" Judge Forrest said. Ulbricht's request to serve his time in a prison with more relaxed security was also denied during the hearing. Ulbricht has said he plans to challenge the guilty conviction. ""You are no better a person than any other drug dealer."" The charges stem from Ulbricht's management of the Silk Road, which used Tor Hidden Services and Bitcoin payments to create an ostensibly anonymous marketplace for drugs and other goods. Shut down in October of 2013, the Silk Road was the largest marketplace of its kind, and subsequent attempts at similar online marketplaces have been stymied by law enforcement actions and exit scams. The prosecution estimates that the Silk Road handled as much as $200 million in drug transactions, a figure that played prominently into today's sentencing decision. Parents of #SilkRoad victims spoke before sentencing. Ulbricht broke down in tears as he apologized to them: ""I never wanted that to happen""  The defense also made an extensive appeal for leniency, citing Ulbricht's ability to contribute to society in spite of his crimes. Ulbricht's team submitted nearly a hundred letters from friends, family, and other acquaintances, testifying to Ulbricht's good character. ""I’ve had my youth, and I know you must take away my middle years,"" Ulbricht wrote in a pre-sentencing statement, ""but please leave me my old age."" Judge Forrest had a harsh reaction to Ulbricht's plea, describing it as a ""display of arrogance that the court takes into consideration.""",0.5873117726825013,0.41268822731749866,0.8412652968131217,394,5.2411167512690353,254,6.1417322834645667,0,0,"Policy & Law, US & World, Breaking"

Or, they might if sporting authorities allowed it. As the NFL off-season begins to pick up steam with training camps and practices — perhaps ideal fodder for live streaming — it seems that even the teams themselves are banned from using Periscope (and, we assume, Meerkat as well). As spotted by The Daily Dot yesterday, the New Orleans Saints' Twitter account tweeted that it's an ""NFL rule"" that ""teams aren't allowed to use Periscope"" at practices in response to a fan's question. Then, when answering a follow-up question about the many teams who have official accounts on Periscope, @Saints responded that ""some teams set up accounts before rule was in place, probably won't be using them for now."" Sporting authorities are so far taking a cautious approach to live streaming It's not clear exactly when this rule came into force, but it does fit the sporting industry's general reaction to live-streaming apps. While it was to be expected that copyright holders would clamp down on streams of pay-per-view events like the Mayweather-Pacquiao fight, some sporting authorities have been more broadly restrictive. The NHL, for example, reminded fans in April that broadcasting footage ""before, during, and after"" games is forbidden, and reportedly called special attention to journalists streaming pre- and post-game interviews. The desire to clamp down on unofficial broadcasting of any sort even led the PGA Tour to strip a journalist of her media credentials after she Periscoped a practice round at the Masters. In the case of live streaming NFL team practices, it could be that the ruling simply reflects coaches' desire for privacy (after all, no one wants to give away their tactics), but it's possible that live streaming might yet be embraced as a marketing tool. Speaking to the New York Daily News earlier this month, a spokesperson for the NFL said that the sporting body would spend the off-season ""evaluating"" the potential of the technology. In other sports, the approach is more open, with Major League Soccer's New England Revolution frequently periscoping pregame interviews and the like before uploading the footage online.",0.7166046708505708,0.2833953291494292,0.8266132740113963,388,5.1804123711340209,246,5.9837398373983737,0,0,"Tech, US & World"

Whether it's self-piloted drones or Big Dog-style walkers, self-piloted crafts are already here, and adding autonomous weapons is a natural next step. By now, the question isn't can we, but should we? That question came to a head this April, when the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (or CCW) met in Geneva to discuss the issue, and in the wake of the meeting, a number of researchers and professors have weighed in publicly. Earlier this week, political scientists Michael Horowitz and Paul Scharre urged caution on autonomous systems in The New York Times, while Berkeley computer scientist Stuart Russell encouraged further debate with a column in Nature. Neither piece called for an outright ban on Lethal Autonomous Weapons Systems (or LAWS), although others like nanophysicist Mark Grubud have in the past. Instead, these pieces propose treating lethal robots as a controlled area of research, akin to nuclear reactors or chemical weapons. The crucial point, the critics say, is maintaining human autonomy over the system — in essence, a person behind the wheel. That person can be trusted to make moral decisions, and face the consequences if those decisions go wrong. They are familiar with the Geneva Convention, to be even more specific, and could be prosecuted if they violate it. A lethal autonomous robot, on the other hand, would be bound by no such logic. ""Humans must... face the horror of war squarely, not outsource it to machines."" Part of the urgency of the debate is that, for many, lethal machines seem like a logical next step. Computers have been taking over human tasks for decades now, leeching away human autonomy over simple tasks, and extending that to battlefields could save soldiers’ lives and confer strategic advantages. But LAWS critics argue that the decision to engage in combat — literally, the decision to kill — is different. Without human beings making the decision to kill, the concern is that killing will happen indiscriminately, slowly lowering the bar for the use of violent force. Once death happens by algorithm, what’s the incentive to preserve life? ""Humans must ultimately bear moral responsibility and face the horror of war squarely, not outsource it to machines,"" Sharre and Horowitz tell us. It’s a morally intuitive place to draw the line. The act of killing is powerful, and empowering machines or algorithms to take it on should make us queasy. In talking about LAWS, that queasiness gets reduced to a clear decision — to deploy or not to deploy — and we have complete control over the answer. We grant humans autonomy from the beginning and worry about extending that autonomy to machines. But there's something missing from the debate. Killer robots really are troubling, and if we can, we should stop them from being created and deployed. It’s good to raise doubts about the wisdom of crossing that line. But in making that case, we miss how far past the line we’ve already come. In today’s wars, human autonomy is already compromised, maybe hopelessly so, and the truly frightening machines aren’t the ones carrying weapons. A few days after the Geneva meeting let out, the White House announced that a drone strike had mistakenly killed two hostages in Pakistan earlier this year. The victims were an American named Warren Weinstein and an Italian named Giovanni Lo Porto. They were newsworthy because of their passports, but they were far from the first collateral casualties. The Bureau of Investigative Journalism estimates between 400 and 900 civilian deaths in Pakistani drone strikes since 2004, roughly a quarter of which have been children. It's hard to say who's responsible for killing Weinstein or Lo Porto or the hundreds of others, even with a human at the controls. President Obama has emphasized the precision of US drone strikes, as part of his larger moral defense of the program, but many of the structural elements of the drone program make such casualties inevitable. The NSA often geolocates targets using SIM cards, but a single target might have as many as 16 SIM cards, many of which would be used by friends and family. Without ground support, it's difficult to tell if a SIM-targeted strike reached its target or just a fellow traveler. ""They might have been terrorists,"" a former drone operator told The Intercept, describing one such strike. ""Or they could have been family members who have nothing to do with the target’s activities."" It's hard to call this autonomy Even when the intelligence is good, it's easy for the strike to miss. Many targets travel with their families, and once the group is inside a building, it can be hard to tell one warm body from another. As a result, PTSD is common among drone pilots, including one pilot named Brandon Bryant who was responsible for 1,626 deaths and described performing his duties in ""a fugue state of mind."" In some sense, this is how the system is supposed to work. If you want a human actor soaking up the horrors of war, he will look something like Bryant, sitting in a military base surrounded by screens and orders. His orders come from elsewhere, often based on metadata and algorithmic rules for surfacing possible targets. He can’t leave his post until his tour is up, and then his spot will be filled by someone else. The machine trundles along without him, and there’s no shortage of replacement parts. It's hard to call this autonomy. Scharre and Horowitz worry about outsourcing the horror of war to machines, but currently, that horror is outsourced to people like Bryant, who face down the realities of war without any means of changing them. We want moral actors piloting these weapons, but we haven't made room for them. In practice, the person pulling the trigger is just another part of the machine. That’s not an argument for deploying autonomous killing machines, but we should be honest about why they seem so inevitable. Our military systems are already so automated, it’s easy to see where lethally autonomous bots would fit in, and much of that automation has happened without any debate at all. Having come this far, how could we stop? Our weapons shape us, and they have shaped us into something unthinkable. It's hard to imagine how we might go back, even for the world's would-be military philosophers. ""Almost all states who are party to the CCW agree with the need for ‘meaningful human control’ over the targeting and engagement decisions made by robotic weapons,"" Russell writes. ""Unfortunately, the meaning of ‘meaningful’ is still to be determined.""",0.49184006830799254,0.5081599316920075,0.8455699339774023,1118,5.0152057245080499,606,6.2128712871287126,1,0,"US & World, Editorial, National Security"

The program came on the heels of the Stuxnet campaign against Iran that met with much greater success. Traveling over USB, Stuxnet was able to infect air-gapped control systems in Iranian nuclear facilities, triggering an overload that destroyed as many as a thousand nuclear centrifuges. The Stuxnet malware has been an object of fascination for security professionals ever since, as the global spread of the malware has made samples easy to find. Some have speculated that a similar tactic could have been used against North Korea's nuclear program, but this is the first hard evidence that such a campaign actually took place. The North Korean nuclear program is thought to be based on technology similar to Iran's, but appears to have been protected by the isolated nature of the North Korean web. Both computers and internet access are strictly controlled in North Korea, making it significantly more difficult for malware to break in from the outside.

Daredevil, Chef's Table, Wet Hot American Summer: First Day of Camp, season two of BoJack Horseman, and season three of Orange Is the New Black were met with glowing praise. Even its indifferently received shows, Sense8 and Grace and Frankie, were more watchable than what HBO and the rest of television offered this season — and most seasons. Netflix will cap the summer with two big premieres. One is Narcos, an award-friendly drama tracking Pablo Escobar and the Medellin Cartel. The other is Dinotrux. In case you've missed the promotional rollout for Dinotrux, here's how I imagine its elevator pitch went: Netflix CEO: Okay Baxter, you have until the 12th floor. Make it snappy. Baxter: Well you see, sir, it's an animated series inspired by the Saturday morning cartoons of our childhood, while adding... Netflix: Simpler, Baxter. Baxter: Umm... It's Cars... meets Transformers... meets Jurassic Park. Netflix CEO: I said simpler! Baxter: Dinosaurs but they're also trucks. And it's called Dinotrux. *DING* Elevator operator: 12th floor. Netflix CEO: Baxter my boy, I love it. Here's $5 million for initial production costs. Have 11 episodes on my desk by August. The show, created by DreamWorks Animation, based on the children's books of the same name, looks out of place among Netflix's rapidly growing catalog of murky adult drama, alt-comedy reboots, and gritty Marvel serials.  If it wins awards, they will be for excellence in a genre of television that claims to teach youth valuable life lessons, when we know its true purpose is to distract kids while their parents prepare dinner or read a book. Cars meets Transformers meets Jurassic Park Dinotrux is not for me, and because you have the reading comprehension to enjoy this article, which puts you somewhere between 11 and 110 years old, it's probably not for you. Welcome to the latest phase of Netflix. With ultra niche programming, like last month's Wet Hot American Summer: First Day of Camp, Netflix has felt, for its most ardent fans, like a studio creating television just for us narrative snobs. But in reality, Netflix was just laying a foundation. We — the binge-watchers, the early adopters, the FOMO brigade — will maintain our Netflix subscriptions so long as they continue to give under-appreciated talent more freedom and better rates than they can get anywhere else. Dinotrux, on the other hand, is the face of Netflix's ambitious plan for expansion. Unlike network television and cable, Netflix doesn't rely on advertisers. How many people watch any single program is irrelevant. What matters is the number of additional subscribers it attracts. This means, for better and worse, Netflix isn't motivated to make a program for an audience it already has on lock. Welcome to Netflix Phase Two Netflix's first phase focused on the kind of programs that TV fans love to discuss (and promote) on social media, but the programs also targeted a variety of unique audiences that don't traditionally overlap. A political thriller, a horror serial, and a dramedy appeared alongside superheroes, period costumes, and talking animals. Netflix will continue to produce and distribute those sorts of shows, along with some of the best documentaries and stand-up routines, if for no greater reason than to retain the subscribers it already has.  But the end of 2015 and much of 2016 will also target the millions of people who have been perfectly fine watching the same basic procedurals and multi-camera comedies year after year. The fourth season of A&E's Longmire will premiere on Netflix in September. Later next year, we'll get Fuller House, the revival of Full House. And on the movie front, we will see king of broad comedy, Adam Sandler, produce four movies, beginning with The Ridiculous Six this holiday. And while I'm reluctant to say anything involving new Adam Sandler films is a good thing, the expansion of Netflix's scope really is good for all of its customers. Netflix also has four Duplass brothers films on the way, a Bill Murray Christmas special, and Beasts of No Nation, a child soldier drama by True Detective season one director Cary Fukunaga. While I can't wait to watch all of the above, I recognize they're probably subsidized by the boost in membership the service gets every time Adam Sandler makes a joke about the elderly's farts. I respect those wacky Dinotrux. They promote friendship, teach good behavior, and allow me to binge-watch a nine-episode reboot of a film that made less than $300,000 in theaters.",0.7073438937846337,0.2926561062153663,0.19145155081349954,757,5.0739762219286657,472,5.968220338983051,0,0,"Culture, Entertainment, Essay"

Because I have Taylor Swift's music on my hard drive, and Spotify searches that music and compares it to its database of ""known music"" (which includes things they once streamed but now cannot), I've hit on a rare combination of factors that both allows an unstreamable song to be listed in Discover Weekly and then also allows a local file to be pulled in and played.",0.43372123000898566,0.5662787699910143,0.5276025737458947,338,4.8727810650887573,207,5.8695652173913047,0,6,

Now make that artist one of the most seminal figures in hip-hop’s history, and that album a near-mythical body of work with astronomical expectations, and you have a recipe for disappointment. Announced in 2002, Detox was supposed to be Dr. Dre’s magnum opus. The hype reached astronomical levels multiple times over the decade it was in production, with Dre calling it a “hip-hop musical,” and one-time co-producer Scott Storch famously calling the album “the most advanced rap album in history,” in 2004. Then came the false starts; a 2005 release was planned then scrapped; Snoop Dogg said the album was finished in 2008, but nothing emerged; Dr. Dre released a snippet of a song off Detox in a Dr. Pepper commercial in 2009, which never manifested into a release; the same thing happened in 2010 and 2011. During this time, the list of collaborators continued to grow the mythos of Detox; Rakim, Eminem, 50 Cent, Mary J. Blige, The Game, Nas, Jay Z, Lil Wayne, Marsha Ambrosius, Swizz Beatz, T.I., Drake, and Kendrick Lamar are just a few of the people who worked on Detox. The challenge to deliver an album that could match the hype grew on a daily basis.    'Detox' was supposed to be Dr. Dre’s magnum opus ""It wasn’t good… I worked my ass off on it, and I don’t think I did a good enough job,"" Dre said on his Beats 1 show The Pharmacy. Even if Dre did manage to do Detox justice, we — fans, hip-hop, planet Earth — no longer had any sense of perspective about it. Wisely, Dr. Dre realized his predicament and cut his losses. Instead, Dre went on to announce Compton, an album created while he was executive producing on Straight Outta Compton, the biopic of the seminal ‘80s hip-hop group of which he was a member. With the weight of Detox lifted, we have been given Compton, a raucous, audacious, impeccably produced finale that enlightens the uninitiated as to why Andre ""Dr. Dre"" Young deserves all of your respect. My grand finale. #Compton http://t.co/nbebhWfLqw https://t.co/DF0i2fqaQF Compton recounts Dr. Dre’s journey as he escaped the depths of one of the most notorious cities in America and built a billion-dollar empire while living in a house with the best view of Los Angeles money can buy. The album opens with a news anchor giving an overview of Compton’s notable shift from a predominantly white suburb in the ‘30s to a black-dominated city by the ‘70s over a swelling beat that grows more menacing as the city’s current state is slowly revealed. It’s a dramatic piece of stage setting, and the final push into ""Talk About It,"" the album’s first proper track, is epic in a way that very few albums have accomplished. It’s the type of treatment you’d find in a big-budget film, not on an album. The production is Expansive and Lavish Surprisingly, it's the appearances with his more longtime collaborators that feel like the rare misfires here. There’s no doubt both Dre and Eminem knew Em’s verse on ""Medicine Man"" would draw ire — which is probably why they censored part of it — why they left it in is beyond me (""I even make the bitches I rape come / I'm waiting on someone to say something""). ""Loose Cannons"" features an outro with COLD 187um shooting and burying a woman. That track, which also features Xzibit and Sly Piper, feels like Dre was doing a favor for some old friends — a risk with this kind of guest-stuffed album, and one Dre avoids almost everywhere else.

Abrams confirms a major plot device for Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Those who saw cinematic trailers and know the Star Wars universe well (or read one of those frame-by-frame analysis pieces) might have already guessed it, but those who are looking to go into the theaters relatively spoiler-free (yet somehow want to read an interview with the film's director), hey, we get it. I also know by writing this, there's something in the back of your head dying to know what that piece of information is, whether it's a new revelation for you or a chance to confirm something you've suspected or read elsewhere. Spoilers are addicting, and it requires you to make a snap judgment about what's more important to you — a slow trickle of small details to tide you over or a chance to sit in the theater and be completely surprised by narrative revelations. Now, for those who don't care about spoilers and want to talk about it, join me after this unrelated GIF.    Here's the relevant tidbit: The Empire has morphed into a junta known as The First Order, while X-Wing pilots like Oscar Isaac's Poe Dameron now fly for a splinter group known as the Resistance. Princess Leia (Fisher) has come into possession of the lightsaber once possessed by her father, Darth Vader, and later lost by Luke (Hamill) when Vader separated him from his arm during that ""join me"" duel in The Empire Strikes Back. The new bit here — the one that's been heavily rumored online but yet to be confirmed in any manner, casual or otherwise, is that Leia somehow has the Skywalker family heirloom. Which is to say, this:   Which was last seen here:   Somehow fell out of the sky to parts unknown and yadda yadda yadda found its way here:   The Entertainment Weekly piece suggests one of the reasons Abrams joined the franchise was to answer the question, as posed by Lucasfilm President Kathleen Kennedy, ""Who is Luke Skywalker?"" Which certainly suggests Chekhov's Laser Sword will be more than a passing Easter egg. Now that you've made it this far, do you feel better knowing? Do you feel worse? (Hey, I warned you.)

Christopher Guest is bringing Mascots, his first feature-length directorial effort since 2006's For Your Consideration, to the streaming service in 2016. Guest is the brain behind cult comedy classics like This Is Spinal Tap and Waiting for Guffman, sharp pieces of satire that are loose, familial, and largely improvised. The streaming service announced the movie by releasing a poster this morning, the highlight of which is the movie's premise: Welcome to all the drama, intrigue, and occasional excitement of the 8th World Mascot Association Championships, where a group of 'unusual' men and women, with big heads and furry suits, compete to win the prestigious Gold Fluffy Award and be crowned best mascot in the world. It's safe to assume that a few of Guest's recurring cast members — actors like Eugene Levy, Catherine O'Hara, and Fred Willard — will pop up in Mascots, but no casting details or specific dates have been provided yet. The movie is the latest piece of Netflix's ambitious move into feature films, an attempt to build on the strength of its existing episodic original programming. The company has signed multi-film deals with Adam Sandler and the Duplass brothers, and it's also releasing prestige pictures like Cary Fukunaga's upcoming Beasts of No Nation and Brad Pitt's War Machine.

It's not for lack of trying — Samsung released six different smartwatches before Apple even launched one — it's just that none of them have been particularly good. Chunky designs, slow performance, and limited software have all been things that have plagued Samsung's smartwatch efforts since they began in 2013. That all may be changing, however, as the recently announced Gear S2 is the most promising smartwatch I've seen from Samsung. The Gear S2 is unlike the rest of Samsung's smartwatches because it actually looks like a watch that I'd want to wear every day. That's largely because it's round, but also because it's much slimmer and smaller than the cuff-sized gadgets Samsung previously made. It looks less like a wrist computer and more like a traditional watch that happens to do smart things, and that's pretty great. That's the same whether you're looking at the sportier standard model with its rubber strap or the dressier S2 Classic and its leather band. Both are comfortable and flattering on my wrist, and look far better than many of the other smartwatches I've worn in the past. The impressive things with the Gear S2 don't end with its new design: Samsung's actually figured out a really smart interaction model for smartwatches that I'm shocked no one else has done yet. There's the touchscreen, yes, just like most other smartwatches, and the Gear S2 has a couple buttons on its side for home and back. But its real trick is in the rotating bezel, which lets you quickly and easily scroll through lists, apps, watch faces, and whatever else you might be looking at on the screen. It's more predictable and intuitive than the Apple Watch's Digital Crown and is a joy to use. The S2's screen is colorful, sharp, and bright, and looked great in the few minutes I got to spend with the watch. It has an always on ambient mode — like many Android Wear watches — that makes it easy to quickly check the time. But this isn't an Android Wear watch: it's running Samsung's proprietary Tizen platform. In the past, that was a huge red warning flag, but Samsung's cleaned up its act, and the software on the Gear S2 is fast and intuitive. There are lots of different watch faces to choose from, including new ""dynamic"" faces that can update with various bits of information, and you can see all of your phone's notifications and reply to incoming messages with canned responses, emoji, or text dictated by voice. One of the most notable updates with the software is that the Gear S2 will work with any phone running Android 4.4 or higher with 1.5GB or more of RAM. That's a big difference from Samsung's earlier Tizen watches, which were limited to the company's own smartphones. Samsung says that certain features, like Samsung Pay (the Gear S2 supports NFC-based mobile payments), are only available when the watch is paired with a Samsung phone, but for the most part, everything should work with other Android phones. The big question mark might be with third-party apps — Samsung says it plans to have about 1,000 apps available for the watch when it launches, and it worked with about 100 developers to specifically create app experiences for the Gear S2. But it's hard to see many app developers devoting time to yet another smartwatch platform when Apple and Google are already in the mix. There are other questions that may make or break the Gear S2, and we'll have to wait until we are able to spend more time with it to answer them. Samsung says battery life should be two to three days between charges, and the Gear S2 comes equipped with a magnetic wireless charging dock (not unlike the one that comes with Motorola's Moto 360) that's far nicer than the janky clips the company used before. That's longer than its previous models and longer than most other smartwatches, so we'll have to see if it lives up to the claim. Samsung also isn't yet telling us the price of the Gear S2 or S2 Classic, and that could determine whether or not this thing's a hit. The company is saying that the Wi-Fi version will be available in early October, and the wireless carriers will announce availability of the 3G model at a later date. Either way, we're eager to learn more about and spend more time with the Gear S2, which is already more than we could ever say about Samsung's earlier smartwatch efforts.",0.6388279930013799,0.36117200699862007,0.17866762866871963,777,4.7232947232947229,390,5.6282051282051286,0,40,"Mobile, Tech, Hands-on"

Track’s governing body, the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF), told her that she could only return to the sport after she lowered her natural testosterone levels to ones that were beneath the IAAF’s guidelines. To do that, she would have to have to undergo surgery, or take hormone-suppressing drugs. She refused and is now fighting the decision. ""You have women with naturally high testosterone who all of a sudden find themselves unable to compete in the category they have always competed in,"" says Katrina Karkazis, a bioethicist at Stanford University. ""They were born as girls, raised as girls, they identify as women, and their legal documents identify them as women — and all of a sudden they must undergo medical interventions that are not for their health, but simply to lower their testosterone.""  ""medical interventions that are not for their health."" Karkazis is one of two experts who published a report yesterday in Science calling for an end to sports policies that ban women from sports because their bodies produce naturally high levels of testosterone — levels that exceed 10 nanomoles per liter in their blood. These bans are designed to prevent women with high testosterone from competing in sports against other women because they have an ""unfair advantage."" ""Androgenic hormones have performance-enhancing effects, particularly on strength, power and speed, which may provide a competitive advantage in sports,"" the IOC wrote in 2013. But the authors of the Science report argue that the rationale behind the ban is faulty, and that women who were raised as women and who have competed as women their whole lives should be allowed to continue. In short, they’re arguing that their biology shouldn’t be policed. ""The IAAF wants to say [that if they have high testosterone], well that means they don’t really count as female,"" says Alice Dreger, a bioethicist at Northwestern University who didn’t participate in the Science report. ""That’s true if you define female-ness according to testosterone levels. It doesn’t define women as we define them, which is your social role."" ""It doesn’t define women as we define them, which is your social role."" Thus, if sporting officials want to base their categories on testosterone, then they should do away with categories like ""men"" and ""women"" altogether, and they should call them hormone classes, Dreger says. ""Let’s not call them gender, and have a [low testosterone] class and a [high testosterone] class — and confuse the crap out of everybody else in the world about what you’re talking about."" The IOC and the IAAF no longer perform ""sex tests"" on its athletes; the IOC dropped chromosomal testing as a requirement in 1999. But they do have testosterone tests which act as a proxy for determining who should be allowed to compete in men’s or women’s sports, in addition to being used to scope out athletes who use testosterone as a performance-enhancing drug. Women who are intersex — people born with a mix of sex characteristics, some traditionally considered male and some considered female, in the same body — sometimes display high levels of testosterone, and these policies disproportionately target them.    The IAAF asked Caster Semenya, a South African runner, to undergo a gender test in 2009. (Credit: Erik van Leeuwen/ Wikimedia commons)  The idea behind the regulation is that testosterone conveys an athletic advantage and that testosterone levels in men and women don’t overlap. But two studies, both released last year, present somewhat contradictory findings with regards to the presence of a testosterone ""sex gap."" The first, funded by the IOC, looked at 234 female athletes and found that 13.7 percent of women had high testosterone levels. That same study also found that 16.5 percent of elite male athletes had testosterones levels that fell below the ""typical"" range for men. Taken together, these numbers provide evidence for a ""complete overlap between the sexes,"" the authors write. But the second study — a study of 849 elite women athletes funded by the IAAF — found that only 1.5 percent of women had unusually high testosterone. ""Complete overlap between the sexes."" The reason for this difference is that the IAAF-funded study pre-emptively excluded women who are intersex from its analysis, the Science report concludes. This is a move that Karkazis says essentially defeats the purpose of figuring out what consists a ""normal range"" for testosterone in all women. ""It’s circular,"" she says. The IAAF-funded study was conducted using the same policy it’s now being used to support. The Verge contacted the IAAF and the IOC by email. The IOC responded to our request for comment by stating that ""the IOC has always taken great care that such sensitive issues are dealt with by broad consensus using the latest scientific knowledge and research in that area."" The IAAF has yet to respond to our inquiry. Testosterone is one of the drugs that athletes rely on when they dope. There is definitely some kind of link between testosterone and athletic performance, Karkazis says, but when it comes to naturally produced testosterone, things aren’t clear cut. After all, the IOC-funded study shows that men with low testosterone are able to compete at elite levels. ""You can’t rank athletes by testosterone level and assume that people with lower levels won’t do well,"" Karkazis says. ""Female athletes have the right to some semblance of a level playing field."" Of course, there is an alternative view. Joanna Harper, a medical physicist at the Providence Portland Medical Center and transgender athlete who has written about her experiences competing against other women while taking hormone therapy says that testosterone is the best method we have for distinguishing women’s and men’s sports. ""The IAAF and IOC have struggled for decades over what they should do with intersex women in sport, and scientists affiliated with both agencies would acknowledge that their current policies are not perfect,"" she says. (Athletes shouldn’t be named publicly, and they should not be made to feel that they need to have surgery to compete, Harper says.)  But in the end, ""I think that billions of potential female athletes have the right to some semblance of a level playing field."" Still, the results from the men’s side of the testosterone spectrum make it hard not to ask why the hormone has become this all-encompassing marker for the type of human that gets to compete in women’s sports. People who are banned from competing are usually punished because they’re cheating or doping. In this particular situation, however, women who are intersex may benefit from a natural biological process. This is just how their bodies work, which means that the IAAF and the IOC are punishing women for not suffering from what would amount to unnaturally low levels of testosterone for them. And what’s worse, the solution that many propose is to alter a healthy person’s natural biology in order to let her compete in a sport that she has worked tirelessly to excel at. (In the case of the IOC, women with high testosterone are allowed to compete with men if they qualify for an event. But again, men with low testosterone aren’t being forced to compete against women.) ""We don't ban athletes from competition because they're an inch taller."" ""We don't ban athletes from competition because they're an inch taller or have more fast-shortening muscle fibers than their competitors — we don't say that it's ‘unfair’ that these athletes have these natural traits,"" says Claudia Astorino, an intersex activist. ""Instead of barring these athletes from competing, the IAAF, the IOC, and other games commissions could simply allow anyone with natural testosterone levels to compete."" Despite these arguments, the IOC and the IAAF have singled out testosterone. ""People who say, ‘this is nothing; we don’t need this rule,’ don’t know sports or are at some distance from sport,"" Arne Ljungqvist, the former chair of the IOC Medical Commission, told The New York Times last fall. But the logic doesn’t appear to come full circle. ""There’s no other realm of sport where we say a natural advantage disqualifies you,"" Dregger says. ""This is literally the only place."" Dutee Chand filed an appeal with the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Switzerland in September. ""I feel that it’s wrong to have to change your body for sport participation,"" she told The New York Times, in Hindi. ""I’m not changing for anyone."" An arbitration panel met to discuss the appeal in March; they will make their decision known soon.

The deal only applies to delta farmers who own land near a river or stream and have rights to channel water to that land, The New York Times reports. Farmers with established water rights like this have not faced state-mandated restrictions since the 1970s. The farmers agreed to cut their water usage by a quarter in the June to September growing season. The move was preemptive — an effort to avoid more severe cuts later in the season. Because the agreement was made with just a small number of farmers, it's unlikely to affect the state's water supply in a significant way, the Times reports. But regulators are hoping the agreement will persuade other farmers across the state to take similar action. Regulators hope for a chain reaction ""We’re in an unprecedented drought, and we have to exercise the state’s water rights in an unprecedented way,"" Felicia Marcus, the chairwoman of the State Water Resources Control Board, told the Times. California has been in a severe drought for several years, with Governor Jerry Brown declaring a State of Emergency in 2014. Last year, water storage in the Sacramento and San Joaquin river basins measured ""11 trillion gallons below normal seasonal levels."" This past April, the governor issued statewide water restrictions for the first time in California's history. The delta farmers, because of their strong water rights, were originally immune to the cuts, AP reports. California's agricultural industry is responsible for 80 percent of the state's water consumption every year, according to the Times. Delta farmers who agree to the deal can choose to reduce water usage by 25 percent under their riparian rights (diverting water to farmland from a stream or river) or they can fallow 25 percent of their land, which means that land won't be seeded. Regulators have agreed not to impose further restrictions on farmers under this deal through September. Farmers who want to participate must submit a plan to the state by June 1st outlining how they plan to reduce water usage.

It also said that it wants suppliers to cease using antibiotics for growth purposes and to adopt voluntary FDA guidelines that limit the use of medically important antibiotics.  ""We believe that farm animals in our supply chain should be treated humanely."" ""We believe that farm animals in our supply chain should be treated humanely throughout their lives and that the welfare of farm animals should be considered in selection of all production systems, practices, and technologies,"" Walmart writes on its website. It's not stated how strictly Walmart will hold its suppliers to supporting these practices, nor does it state a specific date that it would like to see them implemented by. Rather, Walmart simply writes that it will begin working with its supply chain partners to put these practices in place. Still, as the largest food retailer in the US, Walmart's adoption of these guidelines marks a major push toward humane animal treatment and responsible antibiotics usage. If suppliers want to work with Walmart, it seems that they'll eventually have to adopt these rules, which could have a fairly wide effect. Walmart specifically calls out a number of issues that it would like to see resolved. Those include stopping the use of animal housing that's too confined, finding alternatives to painful practices like de-horning and castration, and ending slaughter without making an animal insensitive to pain. It's asking suppliers to provide animal welfare reports both to Walmart and the public on an annual basis so that tabs can be kept on their progress. Specifically, the five freedoms include:   Major food sellers have been announcing their intention to eliminate unnecessary antibiotics usage over the past year. McDonald's and Chick-fil-A have both set timelines for removing some or all antibiotics use. An apparent side effect of this is that Tyson Foods, one of the biggest meat processors in the world, has set the goal of eliminating use of human antibiotics by September 2017. Perdue has also been cutting down on the use of human antibiotics on chickens. The use of antibiotics has become a growing public health issue, as overuse at the farm has begun leading toward more resistant strains of bacteria that can harm humans, too. Walmart makes it clear that it realizes customers are increasingly interested in supporting sustainable practices, which has led to the adoption of these new stances today.

The laws would provide a comprehensive framework for preventing migratory bird killings resulting from human intervention. The most established bird protection law, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA), is nearly 100 years old, and most of it doesn't account for recently developed threats. The proposals account for accidental bird death The MBTA was introduced in 1918 as a way to prevent people from hunting, capturing, killing, and selling near-extinct migratory birds. But many of the threats facing birds today — wind turbines, high-tension power lines, communications towers — weren't pervasive when the MBTA was first introduced. The MBTA allows for the hunting of migratory birds with a permit, as long as bird populations have the numbers to sustain themselves. But there are no laws currently in place to account for the accidental killing of birds — electrocution, collision, being trapped in an oil well. The US Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) released a notice of intent outlining the ways in which the deaths of migratory bird populations could be reduced. Some of the suggestions include: closed containment systems or netting over wastewater disposal pits to prevent birds from entering, removing perches and small openings from gas burner pipes where birds can get trapped, and making communication towers shorter and less attractive to birds. Power distribution lines can also be designed to deter birds from landing on them. The suggested regulations would exist under the MBTA. The House Republicans introduced a bill earlier this year to prevent energy companies from facing severe legal ramifications for failing to comply with bird protection laws. The FWS says it will consider a ""conditional authorization"" for certain industry sectors as long as they adhere to appropriate standards of protection.

In addition to their uniquely alien intelligence, cephalopods are known to change color based on their surroundings. That ability is thought to rely mainly on eyesight, as the creatures can visually detect basic changes in the environment and camouflage themselves in order to hide from predators. However, new research shows that pigment proteins found in eyes are also present in cephalopod skin, allowing them to detect different kinds of light without input from the brain. The research, published in the Journal of Experimental Biology, investigates how cell structures known as chromatophores interact with light, and is an extension of research on octopuses that was conducted in the 1960s. Chromatophores contain pigment and control color expression in the skin — melanocytes in humans function the same way — but in cephalopods they also feature rings of muscle that allow them to expand, changing their color. Researchers were able to prove that chromatophores respond directly to light by taking biopsies of octopus and squid skin and exposing it to different wavelengths of light. The chromatophores in the skin samples expanded the most when exposed to blue light — the same kind of light that opsins, or the proteins found in eyes that detect pigment, respond to the best. The team then tested the skin for the presence of opsin genes, and discovered that the sensory neurons in the skin produce the opsins needed for light detection. Cephalopods are believed to be colorblind The findings are significant because cephalopods are believed to be colorblind, so their ability to mimic their surroundings has confounded observers for years. Research published in the 1970s showed that while octopuses can distinguish between light and dark colors, they were unable to recognize different hues. While cephalopods aren't alone in their having light-detecting opsin in their skin — other animals like the Moorish gecko are capable of much the same — this research gives a clearer picture of how the octopus evolved one of its more fascinating behaviors.",0.7615115657464611,0.23848843425353894,0.8112995775436288,341,5.3137829912023458,197,6.4010152284263961,0,0,Science

While it seems like it should be a safe assumption to link the spill to the dolphins' deaths, there's been a holdup: the dolphins actually started washing up in elevated levels two months before the spill, potentially because of a cold winter.  ""Some of the most severe lung lesions I have seen."" But the deaths have continued into 2015, and researchers have been trying all the while to determine what the actual cause is. In the latest study, researchers from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration describe serious health issues in washed-up dolphins that are linked to petroleum product exposure, strengthening the link between dolphins' deaths and the BP-owned well's spill. ""These studies have increasingly pointed to the presence of petroleum hydrocarbons as being the most significant cause of the illnesses and deaths plaguing the Gulf’s dolphin population,"" Teri Rowles, head of NOAA’s health and stranding program for marine mammals, says in a statement. ""This study carries those findings significantly forward."" The findings were published this week in PLOS One. The researchers looked at 46 dolphins that washed up between 2010 and 2012, finding lung and adrenal lesions as well as an increased likelihood that they had of bacterial pneumonia. In 70 percent of the dolphins with pneumonia, ""the condition either caused or contributed significantly to death,"" the researchers write. Close to 1,400 dolphins or whales have been stranded in total, the vasty majority of which — 94 percent — were found dead. About one-fifth of all examined dolphins had pneumonia or adrenal issues, more than 10 times as many as a normal population is expected to see. The effects are all said to be consistent with what other mammals experience when exposed to oil.  Dolphins swimming through the oil spill in 2010. During a conference call discussing the findings, lead author Stephanie Venn-Waston said that ""no feasible alternatives remain"" for explaining the cause of these lesions, according to Smithsonian. BP disagrees, saying, ""The data we have seen thus far, including the new study from NOAA, do not show that oil from the Deepwater Horizon accident caused an increase in dolphin mortality."" But the findings back up earlier studies that say dolphins in the Gulf of Mexico are experiencing lung diseases and seeing increased deaths because of the spill. The researchers describe these effects as particularly harmful.

But after scientists implanted chips into his brain three years ago, he's been able to move a robotic arm — to shake hands; play rock, paper, scissors; and yes, drink beer, according to a study in the journal Science. ""I want to be able to drink my own beer — to be able to take a drink at my own pace, when I want to take a sip out of my beer, and to not have to ask somebody to give it to me,"" Sorto says in a statement from the California Institute of Technology. ""I really miss that independence."" ""I really miss that independence.""Sorto is one of a handful of people who have been given brain implants to help move objects with their minds since 2006, when a paralyzed man named Matthew Nagle moved a cursor on a computer using only his thoughts. Since then, scientists have been trying to refine the process to benefit other paralyzed patients. Today's study differs from most previous research in the area of the brain researchers targeted for implants — and may lead to better control for patients. Previously, scientists focused on the primary motor cortex, a part of the brain which coordinates the contractions muscles require to move — but that made for jerky movements. That may be because human limbs can move about 27 different ways, says researcher Richard Andersen, a neuroscience professor at CalTech. Instead, his group targeted a different area in the brain, one he'd studied in animals, called the posterior parietal cortex. While the primary motor cortex focuses on specific muscle movements, the posterior parietal cortex is about planning movements. Information from the implants in the posterior parietal cortex transmit the intent to pick up a pint of beer and lets the computer figure out how to make the movement. ""I wanted to run around and just high-five everybody.""""If we can indicate the goal, we can have smooth, natural movements toward the goal,"" Andersen says. The first time Sorto tried to control a robotic arm, 16 days after surgery, he pantomimed a handshake with a researcher. ""It was the first time he'd moved a limb in 10 years,"" Andersen says. ""It was amazing for him."" Sorto agrees.  ""I was surprised at how easy it was,"" he says. ""I remember just having this out-of-body experience, and I wanted to just run around and high-five everybody."" It's not yet clear which area of the brain is better for implanting the chips — four square millimeters that record the activity of about 100 neurons — since the two methods haven't been compared head-to-head. But it may be that the real best way to create new prosthetic would be to embed chips in both, says Andrew Pruszynski, an associate professor of physiology and pharmacology at Western University. (He wasn't involved in the research but co-wrote an editorial accompanying it.) That way, the computer gets information about intent and precise movements, more closely mimicking how we control our own limbs. ""You’d have high-level signal of what the person wanted to achieve but get some info on the low-level signals for more precise control,"" he says. It's a tough problem to solveThe implants aren't ready for prime time yet, Andersen says, and won't be for a while. That's because right now, Sorto has wire bundling connecting his implant to the computer that controls his robot limb. The wire bundling goes through a plug in his skin — which could be a prime site for infections. (Sorto hasn't had any infections there yet, Andersen says.) Ideally, the implants would need to be wireless, but the amount of information coming out of the chips is so large, it's a tough problem to solve, Andersen says. Infections aren't the only worry. The chip is like a microscopic pincushion that's pushed into the brain, Pruszynski says. There's some damage associated with that, and the recovery process may mean that some of the points of contact might be lost over time. What's more, the body is a corrosive place — so the implant has to be stable for a long period of time, because it's not feasible to repeat serious surgery every 5 years, he says. like a microscopic pincushion that's been pushed into the brain But what might really improve the device would be feedback. Right now, Sorto is controlling his limb by watching it. But that's not as fine-grained a movement as he might ideally like — it's like trying to move your hand when your arm's fallen asleep, and you can't properly feel where in space it is, or any kind of pressure against it, Pruszynski says. Andersen agrees that feedback would improve control, and his group is considering ways to pipe information into the brain, as well as out of it. Andersen's group has implanted chips in two more patients, and will be exploring the technique further, in the hopes of creating touch feedback. Maybe moving objects or playing video games with your mind isn't going to be routine any time soon — but for patients like Sorto, the benefits go beyond just drinking his own beer. The study has given him a sense of purpose. ""As much as the project needed me, I needed the project,"" Sorto says. ""It gives me great pleasure to be part  of the solution for improving paralyzed patients' lives.""

What I didn't expect was for automaker Mini, best known for its adorable compact cars, to be in that mix. Announced today at the Shanghai auto show, I got to try the Mini Augmented Vision system at the company’s lavishly appointed downtown San Francisco dealership last week and get a guided tour of how they might work in the real world. From a fashion perspective, the glasses aren’t exactly subtle — they closely resemble ski goggles, or old-timey aviation goggles, but with a camera mounted dead-center to let it see what you’re seeing. The project began life a year and a half ago as a collaboration with Qualcomm; it’s just an experimental prototype for now, but the two companies believe that the automobile is a clear path toward finding a use for head-mounted displays. It’s also a path that hides most of the technology’s current shortcomings. ""We think the long-term vision for something on your head where it's a head-up display for your life is super compelling,"" says Qualcomm augmented reality VP Jay Wright. ""The challenge is there's a lot of technology required to make it happen."" As Qualcomm sees it, those challenges include privacy, fashion, interacting with a device that has few standard control schemes, and battery life to make it last all day — all problems that Google Glass was unable to really overcome during its ""Explorer"" phase. Is a car the right place for this technology? Mini thinks so Mini’s parent company BMW already offers heads-up displays in a variety of models — a rudimentary form of augmented reality. ""It became pretty clear to [Qualcomm] that maybe the heads-up display for your life starts out as the heads-up display in your car,"" says Wright, which made the partnership a natural fit. Privacy and battery concerns seemed less pressing for a device mostly worn while driving, and the bevy of controls already on a steering wheel or a dashboard could provide a good way for controlling the device without taking your hands off the wheel.  BMW’s DesignworksUSA studio worked on Mini Augmented Vision’s physical design, with Qualcomm and San Francisco-based Osterhout Design Group building and manufacturing the technology inside of the glasses. The end result isn't something you’d want to wear all day, the goggles aren’t uncomfortable. They are bulky, though — a necessity to fit in the twin 720p displays (one for each eye) as well as the Snapdragon 805 processor and networking gear, all contained inside the headset. With the goggles on, the displays are bright enough; the resolution isn’t great, but it’s probably sufficient for the use case. (You wouldn’t want to watch a movie or play games on it.) The graphics don’t fill your entire field of vision, but the augmented imagery becomes far less important toward the periphery anyway. It’s also pretty easy to look ""through"" the graphics on the display to the real world, though trying to talk to someone while the goggles were on was a pretty weird experience. Once I had the goggles properly fitted on my head, I got to step through Mini’s carefully constructed demo showing off some of the headset’s key features. While the goggles are primarily designed as driving tools, Mini demonstrated them as something you can wear on all legs of a journey — getting to your car, actually driving to a destination, and then the ""final leg"" of walking to where you’re going. With the glasses calibrated, I was directed to look at a few different posters up on the wall in the demo area, meant to represent ads for events you might see around your city. When I looked at one, more info popped up about it: exact location, ticket availability, and so on. Turns out it was sold out (bummer), but the next fictional outing I looked at was still available, and my goggles asked me if I wanted to navigate to it. Using a small touchpad / button on the top of the glasses, I could swipe back and forth between options and click down to confirm it as a destination. It works pretty well for minimal interaction and a quick confirmation of an action, but I could see it being a bit laborious if you were scrolling through longer lists — the touch area is quite small, only about as large as your fingertip. That’s the only interface element here — there’s no gesture recognition of any kind. Once I confirmed that I did indeed want to navigate to this trendy event, my goggles kicked into the three-stage navigation mode. First, I got directions from my current location to wherever I parked my Mini. When I got to the car, my glasses prompted me to get inside, at which point the navigation features were handed off to the car itself (instead of from your smartphone, which you’d need to get the goggles connected when you’re away from Wi-Fi). Inside the car, the demo kicked off in earnest — in lieu of getting to drive, the wall in front of me projected a driving simulation, and the goggles layered data on top of it. As I ""drove"" to my destination, I got to see what Mini and Qualcomm deemed as essential driving information. For starters, my speed and the current speed limit were pretty much always displayed at the bottom center of my vision — handy, but not much easier than the quick glance down at your speedometer. As we drove by certain buildings, I’d get little bits of pop-up info in the corners of the display for points of interest. Like many navigation systems, you can customize this to show you gas stations or any other particular thing you might be looking for, but the system is careful not to overwhelm you with data or obscure what you need to see to drive safely. Navigate your way to trendy events without looking away from the road Navigation made up the main part of the Augmented Vision experience — animated arrows would show you where to go as well as the usual voice commands for turning left or right. Again, it’s not wildly different than other navigation systems, but you truly don’t need to divert your gaze to get visual assistance on where you’re going. As someone with no sense of direction who usually just relies on voice commands from my GPS, being able to more safely see the visual aids sounds pretty good to me, though having any information overlaid in my field of view would probably make me nervous when driving in the real world. The Augmented Vision goggles can also indicate when you’ve received a text message, at which point you can use your steering wheel controls to tell the system to dictate the message back to you. For safety’s sake, it won’t ever actually display the contents of the message on your goggles — it’ll only read it back over the car’s audio system. Cameras all over the car mean you can look right through it The last notable trick showed off in the demo was a sort of ""x-ray vision"" where you can ""look through"" your car and see what’s outside of it. For example, you can see your tire position when parking to make sure you don’t roll over the curb, or you can see a basketball rolling nearby. The system works thanks to a host of cameras installed on the exterior of a specially equipped Mini prototype — when the driver looks toward the door, the necessary cameras kick on and show you what’s on the other side. There’s a positional sensor on top of the goggles that tracks your head movement inside the car to make this all work. It could be great for tight parking and avoiding damage to your car or the world around you, but it’s less useful (and possibly even distracting or dangerous) at speed. Finally, I arrived at my virtual destination, with the goggles pointing out an open parking space nearby and the x-ray vision helping me parallel park better than I ever could in real life — this was an application of the feature that actually felt useful. After exiting the car, it hands navigation back to the goggles and navigates you on the last leg of the trip. At that point, I guess I’d take off the headset and stow it… somewhere? I’d rather leave it in the car, personally, but then I wouldn’t be able to do this last-leg navigation or find my car on the return trip. An inconvenience, but I’m not exactly interested in wearing these augmented reality ski goggles out in public. (If a future version of the system was basically indistinguishable from a pair of sunglasses, it might be a different story.) Ultimately, this isn’t a system I could see myself using in its current incarnation. There’s the social stigma left in the wake of Google Glass, and the value proposition simply isn’t that strong yet — not to mention the concerns I have about augmented reality graphics interfering with my driving focus. But Mini and Qualcomm were both quick to note that this is a prototype built for research and not something they’ll be shipping to consumers any time soon. Still, the data they gather from this research will certainly inform a future project, and Qualcomm’s Jay Wright did make it clear he thinks an updated version of these goggles could be available at some point in the future. Hopefully that research will help Mini and Qualcomm find the ""killer app"" for augmented reality goggles in the car; for now, I’m happy just to look at my speedometer the old-fashioned way.",0.6642342284209573,0.33576577157904275,0.22703164502821382,1660,4.7680722891566267,745,6.1691275167785236,0,5,"Tech, Transportation, Hands-on, Report"

Central Japan Railway Co. announced the feat on Thursday, after the company's seven-car train completed a test run on an experimental track in Yamanashi prefecture. The train beat the previous mark of 581 kilometers (361 miles) per hour, set in 2003, though a spokesman for the railway company tells The Wall Street Journal that the record may not stand for long. Another test run is scheduled for Tuesday, and the train's speed could reach 600 kilometers per hour (373 miles per hour). The train company, known as JR Central, said the maglev was carrying 29 technicians on this week's record-breaking run, though speeds won't be that high once the line opens for business in 2027. JR Central expects the train to run at a maximum speed of 314 miles per hour between Tokyo and Nagoya, which are 178 miles apart. Once the maglev line is up and running, the company expects it to make that journey in 40 minutes, less than half as long as it takes today's bullet trains.

As usual, the 7 is a bit of a standards-bearer — the last generation of the car was the first with BMW's iDrive controller, for instance — and there's no shortage of tech on the new version that can filter down to other models over time. A brief video BMW has posted reveals some of the more interesting high-tech features of the new 7, starting off with remote-control parking, which will let the driver park and summon the car without anyone in it. (It's a bit like the self-parking i3 that we saw at CES earlier this year). The feature appears to be controlled by the key, which has an LCD display in it — it's basically a smartphone unto itself, minus the phone part, and first launched as a limited-edition option on the company's i8 hybrid sports car. It ""operates various functions and supplies you with useful information,"" BMW says.  Parking a car yourself is so 2014 The next 7 Series will also get gesture control and a touchscreen inside the cabin, which — like remote-control parking — were also demonstrated at CES this year. It'll let you control basic radio and phone functions just by waving your hand, and you can interact directly with the display rather than using the classic iDrive knob along the center console. Underneath, the car will be made in part with carbon fiber — a feature they're calling BMW Carbon Core — which saves substantial weight. Like the display key, Carbon Core is borrowed from the i8. The car is expected to be unveiled soon, and it looks like it's nearly ready: along with the video, BMW released a large collection of shots of the car in full camo:  ",0.5854309745500721,0.4145690254499279,0.212054886110189,323,4.5510835913312695,190,5.5052631578947366,0,2,"Tech, Transportation"

Recent years have brought a number of products with novel form factors, like the curved Samsung Gear Fit and the upcoming circular Moto 360 smartwatch. Sharp's new display tech could potentially facilitate far more unique designs than presently possible. Conventional displays usually integrate certain circuitry within their bezels, forcing manufacturers to generally opt for rectangular designs. With Sharp's new tech, that circuitry is spread throughout the display, allowing for not only very thin bezels, but also a potentially infinite number of shapes. The company released a number of images showing the potential for Free-Form Display to enhance in-vehicle infotainment systems. In one, the natural curves of a vehicle's instrument clusters are built into the display, while another shows a screen with concave curves that could fit within a traditional instrument array.   Although Sharp is only showing vehicle-focused designs today, the company notes that Free-Form Display is equally suited for creating smaller tech like wearable devices with oval displays, and it's easy to see a smartphone manufacturer taking a gamble on a non-rectangular phone once the new displays make their way to the market. Of course, extensive software modification would be required to make proper use of a round display, but smartphone manufacturers are no stranger to pursuing odd form factors for the sake of differentiation.

For as long as I can remember, I've had too much to read, and too little time to do so. With the rise of the internet, I'm now at a point where fantastic content is being published on a daily basis, and I'm fighting to not miss a thing. That's why Pocket, Instapaper, and every other ""read-it-later"" service exists; to let you read what you want, at your own pace. But what if you don't want to read a giant feature on eBoy on an electronic screen? Enter PaperLater, a new service from British startup Newspaper Club that lets you save articles for reading later and have them sent to you as a physical newspaper. It's currently in an invite-only, UK-only beta. The printed word has its benefits It might seem wasteful to print anything nowadays — although Newspaper Club says it uses sustainably sourced newsprint with high recycled content — but there are some upsides to the service. Each newspaper comes neatly formatted with an Andy Gilmore-esque front cover, complete with a note on the number of articles, word count, and a whimsical fact on the rarest words included. I haven't bought a newspaper in well over a year, but there's something undeniably special about reading a printed article in Chronicle Text on quality newsprint stock. Because of the medium, articles like Quinn Norton's ""Everything Is Broken"" (which had sat in my Pocket queue for almost a month, its 17-minute predicted reading time bullying me into apathy), were quickly read and enjoyed. In fact, I read through all of the 28,361 words in my personalized paper in a single sitting. I can't remember a time I've ever sat in front of my computer and read so much uninterrupted.  Of course, there are some downsides to the printed word. Ordering and printing your paper could be easier. There's a three-to-five day lead time on orders, which means printing anything but ""timeless"" longform doesn't make a lot of sense. The editorials and reactionary articles that make up a large chunk of my daily reading are effectively off-limits — what's timely today won't be all that interesting next weekend. Articles also aren't presented perfectly, which is forgivable when you're scrolling past an ill-formatted chunk of text in Pocket, but not so much when you're looking at a text link in an expensive custom-printed paper. There's also a seemingly random selection of a single image per story, which can ruin references to photos within articles. Newspaper Club does caution PaperLater is in beta for a reason, but the company will need to fix small formatting niggles like links and images before bringing its service to the masses. Reactions range from 'OMG I want this' to 'Why on earth would you print the internet?' Tom Taylor, co-founder of Newspaper Club tells The Verge that tests of the service have so far been positive. PaperLater appears to be a love or hate service, says Taylor. ""The reaction [has been] divided between 'OMG I've wanted this all my life' and 'Why on earth would you print out the internet?'"" PaperLater will never take the place of services like Pocket — even Taylor admits to using it alongside a similar app. Short articles suitable for a commute go to the app, longer articles get pushed to the weekend for reading with PaperLater. ""It's about giving people the choice to take something offline, and making it really easy to do that."" As odd a service as it may seem, PaperLater's existence isn't without precedent. Newspaper Club was founded with similar principles, and has been successfully running for years. Rather than offering an automated service like PaperLater, the site provides simple tools to create custom newspapers, and it's printed over four million  newspapers since its formation in 2009. Eyeing a US launch For now, PaperLater is still an invite-only service for UK residents — you can request an invite over at PaperLater's site. Newspaper Club says it's currently scaling up the service to prepare for more users, and doesn't have a timeline for a full launch in the UK or beyond, but it is ""looking at printing in the US, as well as talking to publishers and other potential partners.""",0.3438888809097542,0.6561111190902458,0.17716126188340522,719,4.8595271210013911,406,5.9359605911330053,0,0,"Culture, Design, Web"

A total of 1,300 entries have been submitted to a panel of judges in the competition, providing some stunning examples of watch face design for this very modern smartwatch. With a judging panel full of Motorola’s UX and UI designers for Moto 360, and even its design chief Jim Wicks, it’s not an easy competition to win.  The judges have taken 1,300 submissions and created a list of 10 finalists, based on design aesthetic, feasibility, and originality. The result is a mix of modern and analog designs, with some truly unique approaches. All of the top 10 entries won’t necessarily end up shipping on the Moto 360, but Motorola hints in its rules that any entry could be used as a watch face in future. While the winner takes the Moto 360 watch, the nine runner-ups secure a $50 Google Play gift card for their troubles. Motorola is allowing Google+ users vote on their favorite, with the most +1s securing victory on June 24th. Here are the 10 finalists, and you can vote over at Motorola’s Google+ page.  The first entry is Layton Diamen's striking “vanishing hour” design. The central hour counter gradually fades away to reveal the minute marks. Will Rodriguez’s entry mixes a disc design with modern aesthetics. The color customized background plays host to the minutes on the larger disc, and the hour is deployed in the foreground disc. There’s also a weather widget and notifications for SMS, email, and health alerts. Aramis Negron takes a simple approach with this design. The date is stamped at the bottom of the watch face and the minutes tick away in a 360 formation around the hour counter. Jose Azua’s angles design splices the hour and minutes section with compass and timer options. The minutes are gradually unveiled underneath the zipper-like appearance. Pawel Hanusowski’s design looks like a radio readout for the month and day, tuned precisely to the date you need. Accompanied by red accents and a classic watch face, it’s a subtle and smart take. Dave McCarthy has decided to take a minimalistic approach to his design. There’s a simple battery indicator, flanked by almost Swiss railway clock-style minute and hour counters, and a date stamped at the bottom. It fits the watch perfectly. Jason Wang mixes analog and digital to place a radar on your wrist. A small arc at the top shows the hour and the larger arc below represents the minutes. The second hand simply sweeps over them to create a fun radar effect.  David Pascual’s watch design displays calendar events and widgets to provide basic status information alongside the regular watch functions. There’s Gmail notifications, Hangouts, battery status, and even connectivity indicators. It’s all very James Bond. Paul Stringer’s effort looks more Ferrari than smartwatch. The speedometer-style watch face counts the hours on the outside and the minutes on what looks like a rev counter. The hands for seconds, minutes, and hours all fly back to the beginning when they reach the end of their gauges, just like a tachometer. Tyler Allicock’s is simple, yet stylish. A second counter sweeps over the top of the watch face, while the time and date are trapped beautifully inside the bottom half of the design.

Local Motors is already printing out initial models of the winning frame as a test, and it's even given one a drive around. While it isn't clear how much of the vehicle will be 3D printed beyond the body, its limited run and purpose means that Local Motors is able to consider some surprisingly wild designs.

(Michele Anoé) The Internal Strut Frame uses internal bars to support the upper areas of its body, helping to reduce weight without losing sturdiness. It's composed of a single piece and is inspired by the internal structure of bird wings. (TaurusNut) Local Motors says that 3D printing currently has trouble bridging horizontal gaps, so the Aeroblade works around that by using vertical structures to support higher areas of its body. (iMan) The 3D PCX uses an open design that places a spine through the middle of the car to maintain support. (Braunarsch) The LM Supernova is inspired by, well, supernovas and their sudden force. The vehicle is designed to be lightweight as well. (Sebastian.dib10) The Mirage's body would actually be composed of multiple layers, with an enforced outer layer and an inner layer that's meant to crumble, protecting passengers in the event of an impact. (Velocityopen) The e-Spider's goal is to be strong without using too much material. An attachable roof and flexible plastic windows could be used to seal the car for use in inclement weather.

Instead, according to data compiled by JL Warren Capital, the company registered just under 2,500 cars since it started selling to customers in April 2014. Challenges for Tesla in China include simply getting charging stations installed. The vast majority of China's urban population lives in multi-family, low-rise housing, which complicates the installation of home charging stations. Musk has blamed the company's slow start in China on the lack of charging support, but Tesla also faces corporate challenges.

Apple was announced as a partner last week, and today New York-area cable provider Cablevision is being announced as its second. Cablevision said this afternoon that it will offer HBO Now to its Optimum internet and Wi-Fi customers, making it the first cable provider to announce such plans. No other details are being announced, however: that includes when you'll be able to get it, what it'll cost, and how exactly it'll work. HBO Now is supposed to launch in April, ahead of the the season premiere of Game of Thrones.  There's a good chance HBO Now will be bundled with internet packages  Cablevision doesn't say whether it'll be offering HBO Now on day one, but it seems like a possibility. Though Apple has touted its position as HBO's exclusive launch partner, Apple is, in fact, only its exclusive ""non-pay TV"" launch partner. That means that while you won't be able to subscribe over a Roku until Apple's exclusivity period lifts three months from now, you should be able to subscribe though any cable company that makes a deal with HBO. HBO tells us that it hopes to announce more partners soon, but Optimum is the first. Though we don't know exactly what pricing model Cablevision will take up, the deal suggests some interesting possibilities: it's quite possible that some of the first HBO Now deals will be internet package bundles, much like how HBO's TV network is often included as part of premium TV packages. Alternatively, it's possible that Cablevision will simply offer special pricing to its own customers. Either way, this seems to be what HBO wants. Even though HBO is moving online, its service still gets treated as special — and it can likely reach a lot more customers if internet providers are using Now as a perk for sign ups. Of course, that does make things a bit more difficult for cord cutters. Signing up directly through HBO would be simple, whereas we don't know what restrictions, limitations, or odd deals will be offered through partnering cable companies. Customers who sign up for the Apple TV's $14.99 per month subscription will be able to view HBO Now both on the web and on the device itself, which makes it seem like the service won't come with limitations. But Cablevision specifically notes that it isn't listing what devices its HBO Now subscription will be offered on until later.

And The Verge has learned that the company is currently in talks with Silicon Valley's top venture capital firms to potentially raise a new round of funding. Sources familiar with the negotiations say DJI reported around $500 million in revenue for 2014, roughly four times what it did in 2013, and is on pace to do about $1 billion in sales this year. The potential valuation of the company would be a healthy multiple of that, several billion dollars, although no deal has yet been finalized. Forging a new category of consumer electronics The company helped bring small, powerful drones to the masses with its Phantom line of quadcopters, our favorite unit during last year's testing. In doing so, the Shenzhen based firm became one of the first Chinese companies to help forge a new category of consumer electronics at global scale. The Phantom was simple enough for beginners, but powerful enough to interest serious hobbyists, professional photographers, and filmmakers. Last year we dubbed it ""the kleenex of drones,"" and that ubiquity has become a very big business. With over 2,800 employees, DJI now has offices in Shenzhen, Hong Kong, Los Angeles, Rotterdam, Tokyo, and Kobe. It sells several different variations of its Phantom drone, as well as its higher-end ""prosumer"" unit, the Inspire One, and its much larger S-class units. It also has a popular line of gimbals used for stabilizing cameras during flight, and has translated that technology into a handheld camera stabilizer, the Ronin, used by film and TV professionals.     The company was founded in 2006 by Frank Wang, then a student at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. Originally DJI was centered on building flight control systems for model helicopters, which Wang had loved since childhood. But as multi-rotor drones began to gain popularity, Wang deftly turned the company toward that market. The funding comes as competition heats up Before the Phantom, most highly capable consumer drones were sold to serious hobbyists and required a lot of assembly and know-how. The French company, Parrot, had a simple, popular unit with its A.R. Drone, but that was not a very powerful craft. The Phantom represented the first relatively cheap drone that came ready to fly out of the box, but boasted top of the line flight control systems. They also had a potent pitchman in Colin Guinn, who we met for the first time at SXSW in 2012. North America represents DJI's biggest market. Mr. Guinn has since left for rival drone maker 3D Robotics, which two weeks ago announced a $50 million round of funding led by Qualcomm. And Parrot recently released its own more powerful quadcopter, the Bebop, taking direct aim at DJI's Phantom line. Up until now, DJI had taken on relatively little outside capital, preferring to bootstrap the business. But as competition heats up, it is considering taking on venture capital to help maintain its lead and potentially branch out into new sectors of the booming drone market.",0.8829069071850525,0.11709309281494751,0.8455039187475434,540,4.9351851851851851,314,5.8757961783439487,2,2,"Business, Tech, Exclusive, Report"

Judges presiding over the two lawsuits, brought by Uber and Lyft drivers who argue that they are entitled to minimum wage and other employee benefits, said that juries would have to decide whether drivers counted as employees or contractors. Summary judgements for the cases were heard back in January, with San Francisco district judges Edward Chen and Vince Chhabria suggesting at the time that legal precedents would make Lyft and Uber drivers technically employees under state law. But after two months, the judges in both cases were unable to reach a conclusion, blaming both the new type of employment model and California's labor laws. Judges say the law ""provides nothing remotely close to a clear answer"" ""California's outmoded test for classifying workers will apply in cases like this,"" Chhabria said, ""and because the test provides nothing remotely close to a clear answer, it will often be for juries to decide."" The San Francisco judge warned that the that the jury in the Lyft case he was sitting on ""will be handed a square peg and asked to choose between two round holes."" Edward Chen, presiding in the Uber case, echoed Chhabria's sentiments, writing in court documents that the traditional test of employment ""evolved under an economic model very different from the new 'sharing economy',"" and that Uber's business model created ""significant challenges."" Uber was valued at more than $41 billion in December 2014, while Lyft is believed to be worth $2.5 billion. If the juries do agree that drivers for companies such as Uber and Lyft count as full-fledged employees, then both companies could take a hit to their valuation, as they're forced to pay out social security, workers' compensation, and unemployment insurance. The rulings could also apply in other states, and start to deflate the values of a host of other companies that require on the contractors sourced from the new sharing economy for their workforce, such as grocery delivery app Instacart, or housecleaning service Handy.",0.41634165334896034,0.5836583466510397,0.8589262237939378,380,5.1842105263157894,222,6.1081081081081079,0,0,"Apps, Business, Policy & Law, Tech, US & World"

Nintendo shook the gaming world today when it announced a partnership with DeNA, a Japanese company that makes free-to-play games for mobile phones. Calls for Nintendo to make smartphone games have been a regular feature of media coverage and the company’s investor meetings, but CEO Satoru Iwata (pictured above right) has dismissed them at every turn, saying that mobile games risk cannibalizing and devaluing Nintendo’s valuable, popular characters. So with today’s shock announcement, has Iwata lost it, or at least gone back on his word? The answer is neither. We haven’t seen the games that will result from the deal yet, but Iwata laid out his thinking with clarity and eloquence on stage in Tokyo today, leaving me in little doubt that the DeNA tie-up makes sense for Nintendo’s future. Iwata began by acknowledging that Nintendo had a difficult time shifting from the wildly popular DS and Wii to their successors, the 3DS and Wii U, which coincided with the rise of smartphones. But although this caused some observers to believe that dedicated gaming consoles would inevitably get cannibalized by mobile devices, Iwata identified a crucial difference between Nintendo and its competitors: that Nintendo produces, by far, the most important content for its various systems. No one ever calls for Sony to bring Uncharted to the iPhone, or for Microsoft to release Gears of War on Android. But Nintendo has several beloved, long-running franchises that it keeps exclusive to its hardware in the same way, which only heightens the demands for, say, Super Mario Bros. on the iPhone. ""We recognize that our business model of producing both video game hardware and software is effective even today,"" Iwata said, ""and we do not share this pessimistic view of the future for dedicated video game systems."" In other words, while smartphones and tablets may have captured certain casual users that might have bought a Wii or DS were it still 2007, the base of people willing to buy Nintendo hardware to play Nintendo games remains large enough for a sustainable business. To that end, Iwata confirmed that Nintendo is working on a next-generation dedicated video game platform with a ""brand-new concept,"" codenamed NX. The release is likely years away — Nintendo says it won’t announce further details until 2016 — but the mention is significant in the context of the DeNA deal. It demonstrates that the company isn’t going to leave its current fans behind, nor is it going to stop focusing on games consoles. But that doesn’t mean Nintendo can or should ignore mobile devices entirely. ""It is structurally the same as when Nintendo, which was founded 125 years ago when there were no TVs, started to aggressively take advantage of TV as a communication channel,"" Iwata said today, referencing the company’s earlier decades as a maker of toys and playing cards. ""Now that smart devices have grown to become the window for so many people to personally connect with society, it would be a waste not to use these devices."" Mobile gaming has simply become too big to ignore, despite Nintendo’s previous misgivings, and the obvious read is that this represents a major backtrack. Iwata’s pledge not to port Nintendo games directly to smartphones is hugely significant, though. Much as you may think you want a touchscreen version of Mario Kart 64, such a move would inevitably fail to meet Nintendo’s standards. From the NES D-pad to the Wii remote, Nintendo has consistently tied its control methods to its software design, and crudely cramming legacy software onto a pane of glass was never going to work. ""If we cannot provide our consumers with the best possible play experiences, it would just ruin the value of Nintendo’s IP,"" Iwata said today. Instead, Nintendo and DeNA will develop new software from the ground up for mobile devices, which will limit the cannibalization leaves the two companies free to try new business models as well — it’s difficult to sell paid software on iOS and Android these days, even if you are Nintendo. But Iwata downplayed the prospect of using the traditional free-to-play mechanics seen in DeNA games like Rage of Bahamut, Magic & Cannon or Final Fantasy Record Keeper, even though Nintendo itself has experimented with the style in certain 3DS games. Whatever the two companies decide, the partnership is one that makes sense; like Apple’s arrangement with IBM, it benefits two parties that have little overlap but a lot to gain from each other. Nintendo is perhaps the most acclaimed video game developer in the world and has a second-to-none portfolio of IP, but is famously terrible at the internet and has almost no experience working on platforms other than its own. The recent shutdown of Club Nintendo is evidence of this; DeNA and Nintendo are set to launch a new cross-platform membership service this year that will ""create a connection between Nintendo and each individual consumer regardless of the device the consumer uses,"" in Iwata’s words. The service will also be a ""core element"" of the upcoming NX platform; if this helps shift Nintendo’s draconian policies toward digital software ownership, it alone will be a massive win for customers. DeNA, meanwhile, brings an understanding of the mobile market and social gaming that Nintendo has lacked.

Evgeny ""Gene"" Friedman built an empire on taxi medallions, the gold badges issued by the city which are required to operate a yellow cab. Now he is accused by his creditors of falling behind on tens of millions in loans. Even as the population grew, the number of New York City taxi medallions remained fairly limited, and their price had risen for decades, soaring over 1000 percent since 1980, and peaking at over 1 million apiece in early 2013. They were long touted as a brilliant investment. But that trend reversed in the fall of 2014, and prices have been sliding since. According to the New York Post report, Citibank is now taking Friedman to court, seeking to foreclose on 90 of his medallions to cover $31.5 million in unpaid loans. Taxi medallion prices rose steadily for over 30 years, but have recently declined Friedman made his money leasing the medallions to drivers. Back in 2013 he was fined more than a million dollars for overcharging drivers desperate to gain access to taxis. But as the options for these workers expanded with the growth of Uber, Lyft, and other ride-hailing apps, drivers weren't willing to pay as much for that privilege. In a statement Friedman and his lawyers tried to position this as a story about a bank that had gotten cold feet. ""Change has been very good for the taxicab industry, yet mega-banks like Citibank have been unable to move quick enough and adjust to that change when it comes to this industry,"" read the statement.

But questions are mounting over just what counts as wild. Today, a third of all salmon harvested in the state of Alaska — a whopping 58 million of them — are what are known in the industry as ""hatch and catch."" Fully-wild salmon start life in a cool, gurgling stream, in a depression its mother formed by her wriggling. Instead, these salmon begin life in one of the state’s 31 hatchery facilities, where they’re bred from captured local broodstock, hatched, fed, and raised for two to three months (some as long as a year) before being released into the wild. A third of all salmon harvested in the state of Alaska are ""hatch and catch"" But there’s growing concern among scientists and environmentalists over the Alaska’s enhancement program for wild salmon. Worries over straying hatchery salmon, competition for food at sea, overharvesting of wild salmon in mixed stocks, and genetic fitness of hatchery-bred fish are gaining attention, prompting the state’s regulators to take a closer look at practices that have been in place for over 40 years. Although most consumers of wild salmon aren’t aware of the state’s use of hatchery fish to supplement stocks, it isn’t a secret. Alaska’s hatchery program stretches back to the early 1970s and, from the beginning, was carefully planned. Hatcheries were intentionally placed away from large natural production areas, in spots where returning fish could be harvested separately from wild stocks. Each year, the Alaska Department of Fish and Game provide lawmakers and the public with updated reports detailing things like number of egg takes, releases, and adult returns, while wild stock numbers are continuously monitored. Alaska is the largest producer of hatchery salmon in north America Today, Alaska is the largest producer of hatchery salmon in North America, releasing about 1.6 billion juvenile salmon into the wild each year; it's second only in the world to Japan, which releases approximately 2 billion fish a year. According to the 2014 Alaska Salmon Fisheries Enhancement Program report, in some parts of the state, hatchery fish make up the majority of the catch. In Prince William Sound, for example, 45 million salmon returned from hatchery releases, including 93 percent of the commercial catch of pink salmon, and 68 percent of the chum. In Southeast Alaska, 85 percent of the commercial chum catch started life in a hatchery, as did 27 percent of the commercial coho catch. And now, new studies are raising concerns that these millions of hatchery-raised salmon may in fact be harming wild salmon and other species, including young seabirds, after all. We now know not all hatchery fish return to the exact streams where their lives began. Salmon sometimes stray. As far back as 1991, after the Exxon Valdez spill, hatchery fish were discovered in streams where they didn’t belong. ""That was the first we saw them straying into other streams,"" said Jeff Regnart, director of the Division of Commercial Fisheries for the Alaska Department of Fish and Game at a conference in February. ""Later, we found that was continuing for pink and chum salmon, and that has given us pause. We want to understand if it’s going to have a fitness impact on wild populations. Our job is to protect wild salmon."" What makes Alaska’s hatchery enhancement program different than those in Japan or Russia is the state is not using hatchery-bred fish to restore natural stocks lost to development or overfishing. Greg Ruggerone, a salmon scientist with Natural Resources Consultants, a company specializing in fish ecology and fisheries management, says he is most worried about interbreeding of wild and hatchery fish. ""The biggest issue and the one that’s raised the greatest concern over the decades has been genetic issues — interbreeding of hatchery and wild salmon in spawning grounds,"" says Ruggerone. ""When hatchery fish interbreed with wild fish, it confounds our interpretation of the wild stock, making it hard to evaluate."" ""Our job is to protect wild salmon."" But Ron Josephson, the section chief of the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, says they are diligently monitoring areas with mixed stocks. ""If [scientists] find out hatcheries are impacting wild stocks, we’ll have to decide what action to take. These are decisions down the road. It depends on the magnitude of the effect. It’s hard to imagine it’s too large, or we would have seen it in areas like Prince William Sound or Southeast Alaska,"" he says. The state is in the third year of a 12-year Hatchery Wild Interaction Study looking at genetic and ecological interactions between hatchery and wild salmon and any impacts that may have on wild stocks. ""We’re now able to do family tracking through genetics,"" says Sam Rabung, who is the PNP Hatchery Program Coordinator. Today, scientists are able to identify the progeny from two salmon that spawned in a natural system. Or identify hatchery fish that spawned in the wild with another hatchery fish, or if it bred with a fully-wild salmon. And, they can identify their offspring, and whether or not those salmon came back to their spawning grounds at the same rate. ""It’s remarkable,"" says Rabung. The numbers are massive — 58 million returning hatchery fish last year alone — which explains why straying of hatchery fish into wild populations and spawning grounds is a growing concern. ""If 1 percent of fish naturally stray, and 93 percent are hatchery salmon, that’s a big impact on the natural population in terms of sheer numbers,"" says Randy Ericksen, the fisheries science director at Ocean Outcomes, a not-for-profit that studies global fisheries. Straying isn’t the only worry. Generations of returning hatchery salmon could change the timing of natural salmon runs, warns Ericksen. And nuances in salmon, even within the same species, aren’t always controllable in hatchery breeding programs. ""There are differences even in fish that return to the same river,"" says Ericksen. ""Some sockeye, for example, specialize in spawning in rivers, others in tributaries, and others on beaches. You can look at them, and they can even be physically different, but they’re all sockeye."" Hatchery enhancement is very much on the radar of the Monterey Bay Aquarium’s Seafood Watch program, which provides sustainable seafood recommendations to consumers. Wild Alaskan salmon (including hatchery fish) still merit a ""best choice,"" but the group is in the midst of updating its salmon standards. ""The concerns we’ve been looking at are mainly interactions between hatchery fish and wild fish,"" says Sam Wilding, a senior fisheries scientist at Seafood Watch. ""Over the last five years, there’s been more science looking at impacts. But what we don’t want to do is to put something in our criteria that says this is a concern, but we have no way to measure it. You have to be able to measure. Hopefully that will incentivize greater research."" The use of hatcheries to enhance stocks has been a point of contention between the salmon industry and the Marine Stewardship Council, the world’s largest wild seafood certification program. MSC’s greater scrutiny of hatchery salmon are now being addressed in new standards went into effect April 1st, and for the first time, spell out how salmon enhancement activity will be measured. ""Our natural system is finite."" ""The requirement is that enhancement does not negatively impact wild stocks,"" says Megan Atcheson, an assessment manager at MSC. While Alaska takes a closer look at its hatchery program, don’t expect enhancement practices to go away anytime soon. Hatchery salmon provide additional harvestable fish and important economic benefits to the state. ""Our natural system is finite. The only way to produce more harvestable fish is through our hatchery program,"" says Rabung.",0.8704068325554488,0.12959316744455118,0.8914168129177744,1303,5.1980046047582498,604,6.3940397350993381,0,8,"US & World, Report"

According to The New York Times, FCC chairman Tom Wheeler is proposing that the FCC begin providing subsidies on internet service to low-income households. The subsidies would come as part of an overhaul to the commission's Lifeline program, which has offered subsidies on phone service for the past 30 years. The program's basis has been that phone service is so critical to daily life that everyone should have it. Now, Wheeler is saying, that's true of broadband, too.  The program could bring more households online The Lifeline program typically gives households $9.25 per month toward phone service. To qualify, households must have an income of no higher than 135 percent of the poverty line or be part of other federal assistance programs, such as Medicaid. It doesn't appear any of that will be changing, except that households will now be able to apply the Lifeline credit to broadband service instead. The program's shift toward broadband may be necessary to bring people online. As the Times points out, Pew found that, in 2013, little more than half of people making under $30,000 per year had broadband access. Minorities were also less likely to have access, with only 53 percent of Hispanic respondents having high-speed internet at home. FCC commissioners will likely vote on the plan during their June 18th meeting. While the Democratic commissioners will likely support the plan, the two Republicans on the commission probably won't like it. Michael O’Rielly, one of those commissioners, tells the Times that he believes Lifeline is ""inefficient, costly, and in serious need of review."" There have been issues with abuse of Lifeline in the past, and Wheeler's proposal is expected to include additional safeguards to limit those concerns.",0.48470897380502426,0.5152910261949757,0.6383731719323006,311,5.231511254019293,199,5.7989949748743719,0,0,"Policy & Law, US & World"

Lana spoke about a number of topics — her working relationship with James Franco, her jam-packed schedule, her continuous songwriting process — but the most interesting tidbit came near the end of the conversation, when Lowe asked her about her non-musical interests: Lowe: What about interests outside of music? Would you like to go into other arts, other areas, explore other things? Because you’ve been making an album and touring, making an album and touring, and I know that is the primary passion — but obviously, to inject some kind of energy, some kind of enthusiasm, people try other things.

Just seeing where we’re going, because technologically, we’re advancing so quickly, I don’t want to miss any of it. I feel like we’re on the cusp just the way they were in the ‘60s, but in a different way. Lowe: Have you had a chance to talk to Elon about it? Del Rey: Yeah. Lowe: Wow, what was that like?

But once you play it for a while, you'll learn that it loves you. Developers 17-Bit made some design decisions that are off-putting at first, but turn out to be inspired; the result is one of the best games on the PlayStation 4. With its colorful art style and perky voice acting, Galak-Z doesn't look like the kind of game to test your patience. It's a loving homage to ‘80s-era anime — the pause menu distorts your TV's image as if you were playing a VHS tape — even if the stiff CG characters come across as closer to Penny Arcade than Mobile Suit Gundam. But the styling is subtle; there have been an awful lot of 2D space shooters on consoles ever since Xbox Live Arcade took off, and Galak-Z doesn't necessarily stand out at first glance. Galak-Z's controls are tuned to perfection That all changes when you pick up the controller. Galak-Z's unorthodox control scheme is tuned to perfection. It's a little like Asteroids in that you can only fire straight ahead and have to rotate your ship like a tank to aim, but you have two types of acceleration and a lot of say in how you fling yourself around the levels. Momentum is key; you'll often find yourself boosting away from enemies before turning around and firing back at them as you continue to hurtle in the opposite direction. And the laser-dodging juke button is a genius addition, serving as both essential function and cocky touch of flair. It's one of those games that just feels right as soon as you start playing. If 17-Bit had taken this solid foundation and built a series of conventional levels to burn through, Galak-Z would have turned out to be a fun but unspectacular space shooter. I've been playing the game at various trade shows for a long time, now, and always thought it was looking great, but those experiences gave next to no indication of how Galak-Z actually plays on my sofa.   You see, Galak-Z is a ""roguelike""; this term used to refer to games that hewed closely to the template set out by brutal 1980 ASCII-art RPG Rogue, but these days is often applied to games as diverse as Spelunky and FTL. What these games share in common is randomly generated scenarios and a willingness to strip you of all your progress once you die, which is very much the case with Galak-Z; it is to Asteroids what Spelunky was to Super Mario Bros. The game is divided into ""seasons"" of five procedurally generated levels each, and if you die even once you'll be sent right back to episode one. This is painful, because throughout each season you upgrade your ship to the point where you're a lot more powerful than you were when you started out, and it's demoralizing to see that progress erased. But it's also fantastic, because it forces you to play the game in a much more cautious and entertaining way. Since your health carries over from episode to episode, losing just one bar feels like a major setback; the upgrades available when you finish a level are also randomized, so you might not even be able to restore your health for the next episode. Painful and fantastic You'll find yourself avoiding your own engines and relying on inertia to sneak past space bugs, or waiting for an opportune moment to dodge the Metal Gear Solid-like vision cones of enemy ships. The ""season"" metaphor is perfect — each time you sit down to play through one, which could take anything from 15 to 60 minutes, you feel like you're telling your own personalized story. While the overarching plot of each season is predetermined, the mission objectives and levels are different every time you play. I don't know if I'll ever get to the end of Galak-Z's fifth and final season (four are available at launch). It's a punishing game, and at first I thought 17-Bit had made a mistake by skewing so hardcore from the start. But after sticking with it for a few hours, it's clear that the team made the right decision, even if it's no less gut-wrenching to die on a season's final boss. Galak-Z's auto-generated, bite-size structure will make it endlessly replayable and rewarding for those who can get past the initial learning curve. If you're up for a little initial frustration, Galak-Z has my absolute highest recommendation.

No, you had to obtain actual physical goods that they sold in things called stores. That is, of course, unless you were a member of the Columbia House music club. Columbia House offered you Incredible Deals™ when you signed up: you'd get a bunch of free albums for a penny, and in turn you promised to buy a set number of albums over the coming year. (To make things easy for you, Columbia House would automatically send you some albums unless you told them not to.) Mail-order convenience was big back then, and the idea of a subscription music service that came to your door was pretty appealing. But times change and mediums mutate, and now The Wall Street Journal is reporting that Columbia House has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. It was an ugly ending. Revenues for Columbia House peaked in 1996 at $1.4 billion, but last year the company declared net revenue of just $17 million. Hell, it hadn't even been in the music business since 2010. But I'm not here to cry for Columbia House. I'm here to remember.  I'm not sure where I first heard of the service, but I do know what finally pulled me in was an ad in TV Guide. It was a fancy, fold-out ad, probably with ""1 cent"" in big red letters. That penny was the only thing you'd need to pay to get the first collection of eight records (10 if you took advantage of the bonus albums!), and my pre-teenaged self couldn't get over the incredible bargain. I'd pore over the rest of the ad — literally just a list of artists and album names — like I was Ralphie in A Christmas Story, entranced by the potential and wonder. I'm pretty sure 'Like a Virgin' and a Huey Lewis album were involved I'd perused them before, but the problem was I could never really find enough albums I wanted to fill that initial order. That was the trick with Columbia House; due to the agreements in play, they actually didn't have records from everybody in the world. Columbia House was founded by Columbia Records, and competing services offered competing selections, though Columbia House was always the frontrunner in terms of marketing exposure, in my young eyes. Eventually all the pieces came together and I pulled the trigger. I couldn't tell you exactly what I ordered, but I'm pretty sure Madonna's Like a Virgin and a Huey Lewis album were involved. What can I say; it was the '80s.  That first shipment of cassette tapes was like Christmas And that first shipment of cassette tapes was like Christmas. I ripped open the rigid cardboard packaging, and was instantly a music connoisseur with a burgeoning collection that I could slip in and out of my Walkman as I desired. Columbia House didn't just give me enjoyment; it gave me freedom. Empowerment. Agency. (Please disregard that my parents were paying for the whole thing.) This was America at its finest. But that high of consumerism was fleeting, and soon I found myself with music homework. As it turns out, finding subsequent albums to buy was as difficult as choosing the initial batch. It just became easier to let the pre-selected albums come in — imagine U2's Songs of Innocence, but it's a cassette tape that shows up at your house and you have to pay for it. When that initial obligation was up, things didn't get any easier. Canceling Columbia House was notoriously difficult, and finally getting rid of the service was my first young lesson in the dangers of using your parents' credit card. (It was later bested by the $500 I spent calling a Total Recall 1-900 number in the hopes of winning a leather jacket, but one step at a time.) My first lesson in the dangers of using your parents' credit card Columbia House, my nostalgic heart will miss you. You taught me how much fun it was to buy music, and you taught me to avoid mail-order offers at all costs. In a way, you were the good and the bad of capitalism, all wrapped up in one shiny TV Guide ad. May the sounds of Huey Lewis and The News usher you gently into that good night.

Something that not only appears true of life in general, but also the first five seasons of the hit teen slasher/mystery/counter culture fashion series, Pretty Little Liars. In fact, the stupidest thing that you can do when starting a new episode of Pretty Little Liars or True Detective is attempt to remember any information from the preceding episode. These are modern noir serials designed to frustrate — the plot is too complex to understand, and if you understood it, it wouldn't be rewarding.

Secret doors. Woefully incomplete examinations of the root of evil. Woefully incomplete examinations of the purpose of smartphones.

Those of us who are old enough remember a time not too long ago when you couldn’t walk into an office without bumping into one, and some enterprising individuals even went so far as to buy one for their homes. Now, in 2015, many people haven’t even touched a fax machine in a decade (or in their entire lives), but that doesn’t mean it’s hard to find one. Go to any FedEx, Office Depot, or Staples and you can send or pick up a fax, just like it’s 1985 again. And, starting today, that’s what you’ll have to do if you want to get the first look at future-obsessed pop band YACHT’s new album, I Thought the Future Would Be Cooler. Jona Bechtolt and Claire L. Evans spend a lot of time thinking about the future: what it is, what it means, and how even just the promise of it can shift culture. The future is often imagined in terms of things we’ll be able to consume (flying cars, hoverboards, Soylent), but implicit in that consumption is the things we’ll discard in its wake. ""It’s not like technology is something that just develops in a single monolithic way and then as soon as it becomes obsolete it disappears and is replaced by something else,"" Evans said. ""We live in a world in which we’re surrounded by things at varying degrees of obsolescence."" YACHT, which stands for Young Americans Challenging High Technology, began as Bechtolt’s solo project in 2002 (Evans joined the lineup in 2008). Their albums are often thematic — 2011’s Shangri-La explored the idea of utopias — and their sound is somewhere between aquatic pop and mechanical malfunctions. As musicians (with a healthy amount of side ventures),  understanding how people consume things — and the propensity for some of these things to fall into disuse — is a continual area of interest for Bechtolt and Evans. Our inclination to forget or ignore once-common technologies when something a little better comes along has created a little graveyard of unused machinery full of CDs, Walkmans, landlines, and ThighMasters. It’s in this space of tech-neglect that YACHT finds inspiration for I Thought the Future Would Be Cooler.   Enter the fax machine. The band’s newest project gives fans an early look at the album cover — if they’re willing to interact with the real world to see it. First, fans must download YACHT’s single-use web app, Fax.Ink (designed by longtime YACHT collaborators Daniel Bogan and Matthew Spencer), that locates the nearest fax-service store. Then, the app will fax a copy of the album art to that store for the user to go and pick up. The first 300 people to do this not only get a physical copy of the cover art (a photograph by Luke Gilford), but they’ll also get a manifesto written by YACHT detailing the history of fax art. After the cover is printed 300 times, the web app will stop working, and, like the fax machine, will eventually fade into obscurity. There's another reason YACHT chose the fax machine as their album art messenger: its connection to sound. Evans says the way fax machines use telephonic tones to translate images interested her from a musical perspective. ""A transmission that reflects or represents our sound, through sound, for people to physically pick up, is really compelling,"" Evans said. Even still, why would a band so interested in what’s ahead want to ask their fans to go backwards? For YACHT, the fax project is a way to reimagine what near-obsolete technologies can be. ""The fax machine existed in a time when it never really got to be explored as something beyond a business tool,"" Evans said. ""What can we do to take that technology and activate it again? What can we do with the tools that we have now that didn’t exist in the peak of the fax machine’s popularity?"" Then there’s the relationship between technology and the real, physical world. YACHT is asking fans to go pick something up at a store, but they’re doing it with the help of an app. Evans calls it ""an analog distribution platform"" that’s enticing largely because it operates outside of the internet — and it offers a degree of control that’s all but lost in the digital age. ""We’re thinking about it as, ‘How can we release an image to the public in a limited way before it’s released to the public in a broad way?’"" Evans said. ""And the only way to do that in this age is to release it as a piece of paper.""   But it’s more than just a piece of paper. It’s a physical artifact in a time when physical artifacts — especially in the music world — quickly become dusty fossils of a previous era. Online, the album art is just another .jpg, but as a fax, it’s a limited-run art piece translated by a fading technology. And of course, YACHT promises it will still look good. ""We did a test to make sure it looks cool, and the fax gave it this whole other life,"" Bechtolt said. ""It looks like it was made to go through a fax machine."" YACHT has yet to release a single for I Thought the Future Would Be Cooler, but the album’s intricate rollout has already resulted in several projects, or what Evans calls ""tiny monuments."" The band announced their album last month by tweeting a link to Google Maps coordinates with a virtual pin. Shortly after, the band released drone-shot footage of Bechtolt and Evans standing on that corner. High above their heads was a big red billboard bearing the album’s name. After the album announcement, YACHT shared the track list in the form of a GIF-heavy listicle (a ""tracklisticle"") that was published on BuzzFeed last week. And after the fax project has run its course, YACHT says there will be more installments to come. ""We’re in it for the projects right now,"" Evans said. So are fax machines the new record players? Probably not. But their continued use highlights the fact that, in some respects, the world now doesn’t look much different than it did 20 years ago. ""I think we’re in a point now where we’re beginning to realize that the future will be much like the present, only hotter and louder and more crowded,"" Evans said. ""The thing about the future is that it’s mundane."" That may ultimately be true, but for now, YACHT will do what they can to make sure it’s not.

Since then we’ve seen a lot of options emerge, including Swype, SwiftKey, Fleksy, and Minuum. Today, after a year in the making, Next Keyboard is joining the ranks. Is Next the perfect iPhone keyboard? Next, from Tiny Hearts Studio, offers all the functionality of the standard Apple keyboard, but also introduces some innovative new features. Probably its most useful feature is its quick cursor swipe, which lets you move your cursor by swiping on the spacebar. No more peering through Apple’s little magnifying glass. ""We’re on a mission to make the perfect keyboard for iPhone, and [version one] is just the beginning for us,"" says Robleh Jama, founder of Tiny Hearts Studio and co-creator of Next. Jama says Next is already planning updates. The app will soon add swipe typing, as Tiny Hearts works to improve its prediction engine.   Next’s word prediction does better than most other third-party keyboards, although it isn’t as good as SwiftKey’s. Within just a couple of minutes, Next was correctly completing most of my sentences, although it took me about a dozen tries to convince the autocorrect to let me type an Indian friend’s name. The keyboard also has an optional ""Show Case"" feature, which makes the letter keys change from upper to lower case when you toggle the shift button. This feature is on by default, but I turned it off, because it felt disorienting to have my entire keyboard switch cases as I typed. But I can see how it could make it less confusing to figure out whether your caps lock is on or not. Letter keys reflect the case when you toggle the shift button Those familiar with Slack, the workplace messaging platform that takes over your life, will enjoy Next’s integrated emoji keyboard. Along with suggested words, Next will also suggest emoji as you type. So, for example, if you type ""I feel like poo,"" Next will automatically suggest that you insert a smiling poop. I spent a good five minutes just trying to guess the names of various emoji, so this feature gets a big thumbs up.   Other features include full-size custom emoji, different sounds for different keys, and the ability to quickly switch between the alphabet and number keyboard. But there’s a catch. Next boasts on its Kickstarter page that ""you don’t need to enable 'full access' in iOS settings to use Next Keyboard. We’d much rather sell a great product over people’s information."" Technically, Next is right — you don’t have to enable full access to use the keyboard. But none of these last three features will work unless you give Next full access to your phone. Enabling full access is also one of the steps in their setup video, which could easily make users think that they are required to enable full access. The standard iOS full access agreement has some scary terms — according to the box that pops up, enabling full access ""allows the developer to transmit anything you type ... including information such as your credit card number"" — but many developers whose apps request it say that they are not storing and sharing this data. Giving Next full access does automatically turn on the Share Anonymous Usage Data option. You can turn this off by hitting the little circle button to the left of the spacebar and going to Settings. Some features won't work unless you give Next full access Next is already fairly slick at this point in its life, but I came across a couple of bugs while using the early access version. I was unable to change themes even after I enabled full access, and messages consistently defaulted to the Apple keyboard, even when I moved the Next Keyboard to the top of my preferred keyboards list. It's not clear whether these issues are the fault of Tiny Hearts or Apple itself. Next was one of Kickstarter’s most funded projects, and, according to Jama, Tiny Hearts Studios plans to spin out the keyboard into a separate company. You can download Next from the iTunes store for $3.99 starting today. In-app purchases for themes, stickers, and GIFs will be available, although for the launch, all in-app add-ons will be free.",0.497399577983337,0.502600422016663,0.21406014503795956,735,4.814965986394558,408,5.7867647058823533,0,4,"Apple, Apps, Tech"

That formula of pushing the limits of specs and the boundaries of Apple's intellectual property is now being reprised by Huawei. But the Chinese giant, better known for its telecom equipment, isn't limiting itself to Apple — it's taking inspiration and borrowing ideas from every device maker around, while still finding ways to distinguish itself with unique specs in an already oversaturated Android phone market. Huawei's big launch at IFA this year is the 5.5-inch Mate S. That phone's headline feature? Force Touch, the ability of the touchscreen display to sense varying levels of pressure, which can be used to do cool things like weighing oranges. It's a feature that's been rumored to be coming to the next iPhone, having already debuted on the Apple Watch and new MacBooks. Huawei is preempting that presumed iPhone, copying the rumor before the real thing. It did exactly the same with its limited edition Ascend P7 Sapphire at last year's IFA too, beating what everyone was sure was going to be an iPhone 6 with a sapphire crystal display. That rumor didn't materialize, and Huawei only ever made a few of its sapphire-fronted phones, but the Chinese company still deserves credit for its engineering achievement. Only luxury brands like Vertu could previously afford to produce such difficult — and therefore expensive — screens. Huawei's not merely a rip off artist, it's a technically accomplished rip off artist.   Anyone that knows HTC's One series of aluminum unibody smartphones will be instantly familiar with the Huawei Mate S. The chamfered edges, the gently curving back, the plastic inserts punctuating the smooth metal. Even the shape and slight protrusion of the camera are nigh-on identical to the HTC One M9 that launched in March this year. But Huawei is again smart about the way it copies ideas: it didn't replicate the M9's unfortunately weird power button placement, and it didn't set aside an acre of land on either side of the screen to accommodate BoomSound speakers like HTC did. The front of the Mate S is where Huawei leaves HTC behind and goes for simplicity that borders on the undesigned. That seems to be the Huawei way: only take certain bets that have already been proven by others. Sony's Xperia line showed that angular rectangles can still be gorgeous pieces of desirable mobile hardware, and Huawei's Aspire line has been copying the Sony OmniBalance design gratuitously for years. On the software front, Huawei is experimenting a bit more boldly with some knuckle gestures, but even there it's happier following than leading. The motion gestures of the Mate S have been ripped straight out of Samsung and HTC Android phones from years past. There's also a perfect copy of Apple's iOS Spotlight search. On the Mate S, it's activated by swiping down on the home screen, just as it is on the iPhone. And just check out the earphones' packaging in the Mate S box.   When Huawei takes risks on rumored new features, as it is doing with Force Touch, it does so in a limited manner. The Force Touch version of the Mate S will only be available in certain markets — mainly the ones where you can say ""Force Touch"" without being immediately slapped down by Apple's lawyers — so whatever extra cost there is to adding it in can be borne even if it doesn't stimulate any extra sales. But then, the Mate S has already stirred up hype and discussion by following Apple's lead so closely and obviously. Even if you never buy a Force Touch Mate S, you're now better aware of it because of that Apple analogy. Samsung knew this better than anyone else: biting the heels of the top dog is a great way to get noticed. And if you happen to have a well-priced, technically appealing product, you can convert that hype into sales. Huawei has been chasing the hype with unquenchable thirst, and by grabbing all the best ideas it sees in the market, it's been delivering those technically proficient devices to make it prosperous. It's no accident that Huawei is the third-biggest smartphone vendor in the world. The Chinese company combines the best of what's available and sells it at a lower price — which it can afford to do because it only needs to spend on engineering. The innovative ideas are already out there waiting to be plucked. It might not be fair, but it sure is effective.",0.73585543829616,0.26414456170384004,0.17059277759288763,788,4.7906091370558377,426,6.0140845070422539,0,44,"Apple, Google, Mobile, Tech, Editorial, Hands-on, IFA 2015"

Today, the home rental service launched its first smartwatch application, exclusively for the Apple Watch, with features for both guests and renters. The hope is that as Airbnb becomes a more prominent hotel alternative, its users feel that communicating on the app is as functional and available as texting or using chat apps like Facebook Messenger. To that end, the Aribnb smartwatch app will let hosts receive new booking requests that display a name and a photo alongside a message from the prospective renter. The ability to accept or reject a booking can be done straight from your wrist, as can messaging between hosts and guests, which will be handled in similar ways to Airbnb's smartphone and tablet apps. Airbnb on my... wrist? Yes, really Airbnb's smartwatch app will also let you write custom message replies. When a message through SMS or another chat app pops up on the Apple Watch screen, users typically have the option to respond with canned replies written by Apple or a voice message you can dictate on the spot. Apple lets you change those responses for texting, and Airbnb has added the ability. The feature should be important for hosts who are routinely asked the same questions, like what the Wi-Fi password is or whether you should panic and flee the premises if you're locked out. Of course, notifications for notifications' sake are the bane of the smartwatch's existence. There's no point in carrying around another device, especially one strapped to your body, if it's going to over-complicate everyday interactions. To address that, Airbnb had to do a little experimentation.     ""For the watch, we didn’t have any kind of gut or intuition about what that experience should be,"" said Keenan Cummings, head of what Airbnb calls experience architecture — in other words the business of figuring out the optimal way to use a piece of software. Cummings said the team devised a scavenger hunt around San Francisco with the goal of figuring out what could and what should be incorporated into a smartwatch app. Members of Airbnb were scattered about to think of and test out real-world scenarios in which guests and hosts may find the wrist a more convenient place to be pinged. The design and engineering teams then decided that communication should be the primary engine within the smartwatch version of the app to help hosts become more responsive and make guests feel more at ease. For Android users, Airbnb doesn't have any plans at the moment to release the app on competing platforms, even with Google's Android Wear watches now working with the iPhone. ""We will want to build experiences for platforms that we believe our hosts and guests will use,"" a spokesperson said when asked about expanding to competing software like Android Wear.  ""I liked having the constraints.""  With Apple's upcoming Watch software overhaul, called WatchOS 2, due out this fall, Airbnb's design and engineering teams will need to be conscious of adding too many functions for a device meant to keep our head in the world around us. The company plans to launch its app for the new software when it's released some time this fall, but will plan on updating it as it seems necessary. ""I am excited for the new capabilities [of WatchOS 2], but at the same time I liked having the constraints,"" Cummings said. ""We want to avoid doing the things that are tempting because the capabilities are there."" That logic goes for much of what passes as smartwatch innovations these days. For Airbnb, it will need to be sure it's not adding to the already stressful experience of being in a new place and relying on a complete stranger for a place to sleep at night.",0.6422365033306665,0.3577634966693335,0.14454369157242972,649,4.8181818181818183,346,5.9190751445086702,0,2,"Tech, Report"

According to the report, mobile platforms are preferred among millennial consumers (age 16-34), with smartphones, tablets, and laptops accounting for 53 percent of their viewing time. Across all age groups, the number of consumers watching video on their smartphones has increased 71 percent since 2012. Among teenagers, nearly two-thirds of total TV and video viewing happens through a smartphone, tablet, or laptop.   Linear TV continues to command steady audiences, largely due to sports and other live broadcasts, though only 60 percent of millennials watch it once a day, compared to 82 percent of 60- to 69-year-olds. Interestingly, the percentage of cord-cutters has not changed since 2014; one in four consumers reported cutting or reducing their TV subscriptions. Binge viewing, meanwhile, has become prevalent among users of subscription on-demand services such as Netflix, with 87 percent saying they binge view programs at least once a week.

Over the course of three and a half years, researchers traveled the world in a boat named Tara, gathering genetic information belonging to more than 35,000 plankton species that were largely unknown to humanity. By sampling viruses, microbes, fish larvae, and other microscopic organisms at depths of up to 6,561 feet, marine biologists produced the most comprehensive catalog of ocean plankton to date. ""There were pirates over there."" ""We had to take some measures to avoid [pirates] and to be protected,"" says Romain Trouble, general secretary of the Tara Expeditions and logistics coordinator, during a press conference. ""[I was] on-board the vessel with something, like, 85 knots of wind, stormy winds, stormy weather, and this happened a few times across the journey.""   Credit: Christian Sardet/CNRS/Tara Expéditions   Plankton represent an incredibly important link in the chain that unites Earth's living things. They're the basis of the ocean's food web, and they produce half of the planet's oxygen. So, researchers belonging to the multinational Tara Oceans Consortium decided to that they should get to know them a bit better. They gathered thousands of samples from over 200 locations around the world between 2009 and 2013. The resulting catalog contains over 40 million genes belonging to viruses and other microscopic organisms — or about 11.5 terabytes of molecular data, most of which was unknown to science until now. With this data, the researchers answered questions about how plankton interact, how diverse they are, and what factors drive plankton community composition in a series of five studies published today in Science. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the biggest take-away from this work is that the ocean has a lot to teach us still. 11.5 terabytes of molecular data Single-cell eukaryotes — tiny organisms with a membrane-bound nucleus — are a lot more diverse than previously thought, according to one of the Tara Oceans studies. ""We estimated that marine plankton contain 150,000 genetic types of eukaryotes, which is much greater than the 11,000 species of eukaryotic plankton described in the literature,"" says Colomban de Vargas, a researcher at the French National Centre for Scientific Research and one of the authors of the eukaryote study. ""Most of this biodiversity belongs to protists"" — amoeba-like organisms — ""and most of it could not or only poorly be assigned to any known genetic barcodes from our reference database.""  ""Protists are an incredibly diverse group of organisms, spanning many kingdoms, and the documentation of additional undescribed groups…is quite compelling,"" says Rebecca Shipe, a marine biologist at the University of California-Los Angeles, who didn’t take part in the Tara Expeditions. Only 39 of these 5,000 new viruses resembled ones we know about The researchers were also able to hone in on the most abundant biological entities in the marine ecosystem: viruses. ""The majority of them infect marine micro-organisms that fuel our planet,"" explains Jennifer Brum, a microbial oceanographer at the University of Arizona and one of the authors behind the Tara Oceans studies. This means that ocean viruses have a big effect on the dynamics of marine ecosystems. By analyzing viruses found in the ocean samples, Brum and her team were able to generate the largest environment viral dataset ever produced — a dataset that allowed them to identify over new 5,000 viral populations throughout the global upper ocean.  ""Surprisingly despite several decades of prior marine viral research, only 39 of these 5,000 viral populations were similar to previously known viruses,"" Brum says. ""This means that the most abundant and widespread viral populations in the oceans have yet to be characterized — but now we have an idea of what viruses are important targets for future investigations.""   Credit: Christian Sardet/CNRS/Tara Expéditions  The expedition also revealed that the important factor in determining the composition of microbial communities at depth still reached by sunlight is temperature. This means that microbial communities will likely be affected by rising temperatures caused by climate change. And ""since the microbial community is also a part of the food web, it will have direct implications of organisms feeding on those microorganisms,"" says Shinichi Sunagawa, at microbiologist at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory and a Tara Oceans researcher. ""What exactly and how large this impact will be is unclear, however. That ""will require unfortunately more data to study this in more detail,"" he says. The information about community compositions was also used to create computer models that can predict how plankton interact with each other. Then, to verify their predictions, the researchers went back to the samples. ""We could obtain microscopic images showing that the interaction was really occurring,"" says Gipsi Lima-Mendez, a biologist at the University of Leuven and a Tara Oceans researcher. ""So it's really amazing that we can have this experimental support."" The microbial diversity found in the ocean is about four times higher than in the human gut Few large microbial environments have been studied this extensively. So the researchers decided to compare their dataset to one of the only other microbial environments that rivals it: the human gut. They found that despite containing similar amounts of data, the diversity found in the ocean is about four times higher than in the gut. That said, the functions found within the communities — things like defense mechanisms, metabolism, and energy production — weren't all that different. More than 73 percent of the ocean microbial core functions are shared with the human gut microbiome, despite the huge chemical differences that characterize these ecosystems. ""It took me by surprise to see that there was a huge overlap,"" Sunagawa says.   Credit: M.Ormestad/Kahikai/Tara Oceans You don't have to compare the ocean's microbial communities to the human gut to appreciate the work produced by the Tara Oceans Expeditions, however. The vastness of the dataset means that it's now possible to compare organisms found in the South Pacific with organisms found in the Indian Ocean or the Arctic — something that really couldn't have been achieved without an extended voyage of this nature. ""Most of the microbes that the group studied are not organisms that can be grown easily in laboratories,"" Shipe says.  The effort represents the emergence of a new type of research in marine sciences, says Eric Karsenti, Tara Oceans Project Director and researcher at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory. ""I am sure that yet unexpected and ground-breaking results will come out from the many laboratories around the world that will make use of this marine plankton gold mine.""",0.7216864593875998,0.2783135406124002,0.836277869726714,1103,5.3281958295557574,529,6.6918714555765595,0,6,"Science, Report"

Such tiny spacecraft are relatively cheap to launch, but their size also means they have no space for fuel needed for traditional propulsion methods: the small but steady push of a solar sail could be a perfect fit.

And as the recent drought in California shows, this is more than just a speculative scenario. 46 percent of Western America's power stations are ""vulnerable"" Based on simulations covering 14 states and 978 power stations in the Western US, engineers from Arizona State University suggest that in half a century, vulnerable facilities could lose anywhere between 1.1 to 3 percent of their summertime capacity. Power stations classed as ""vulnerable"" make up 46 percent of total capacity in the West and include not only thermoelectric plants, but also renewable sources such as hydroelectricity, wind turbines, and solar plants. The scientists note that in the case of a 10-year drought event, capacity could drop by as much as 8.8 percent. These may sound like small figures, but power providers work within fairly slim margins of error, calculating how much electricity is left over after meeting peak expected demand. ""In the West, this margin is typically between 10 to 20 percent, although in some areas it may be in the single digits."" Matthew Bartos, one of the paper's two authors, tells The Verge. ""In this context, a capacity reduction of a few percentage points could mean the difference between meeting demand and having to buy electricity from a neighboring power provider."" Droughts in California in 2001 led to $2.5 to $6 billion in economic losses Severe drops in capacity beyond the grid's capacity could lead to outages but could also inflict economic damage. In 2001, for example, when severe droughts in California and the Pacific Northwest throttled hydroelectric power generation, electricity prices rose steeply and the region sustained somewhere between $2.5 and $6 billion in economic losses. The researchers add that the threat to the West's electricity supply is compounded by the fact that when the weather is extremely hot, people use more electricity — mostly to power air conditioning — but that the study's findings can't be applied to the rest of the US, as not only does the climate differ, but also the underlying power infrastructure. Currently, power companies aren't doing enough to factor in the affect of climate change on electricity supply, say the paper's authors. While they do note that upgrades to existing plants and new technology may offset the ""penalties imposed by climate change,"" this is far from certain. They add that while renewable energy sources are far from immune to the effects of climate change, they fare better than traditional methods such as steam and combustion turbines. ""Renewables are more resilient to the effects of climate change,"" they write, and their increased use would contribute to ""a more climate-resistant power infrastructure.""",0.3458401608270338,0.6541598391729662,0.8295283689526318,555,5.2342342342342345,312,6.115384615384615,0,0,"Science, US & World"

That places these tools before the birth of Homo, the genus that includes modern humans; as such, it calls into question the conventional belief that it was species within Homo that first learned how to work with stone tools. The findings are being published today in Nature.  Stone tools appear to have existed before the Homo genus It's been the view for decades that the first stone tools were made by members of the Homo genus, says Sonia Harmand, a Stony Brook University researcher and the study's lead author. ""The idea was that our lineage alone took the cognitive leap of hitting stones together to strike off sharp flakes, and that this was the foundation of our evolutionary success,"" she writes in an email to The Verge. These new findings make it appear as though that may not be the case. The Homo genus only goes back — as far as we currently know — to 2.8 million years ago. The presence of stone tools half a million years before that either means that Homo's origins are even earlier than we believe, or that stone tools were developed by earlier ancestors. The latter option is ""the most plausible,"" Jason Lewis, a Stony Brook researcher and co-author of the study, writes in an email to The Verge. In fact, that possibility is one that researchers have been moving toward in recent years. Rather than stone tools appearing with the birth of Homo, it's possible that stone tools developed over a longer period of time. The tools discovered by Harmand and her team even suggest as much: they're cruder than the tools used by early members of Homo, and yet they're not entirely primitive either. The tools, Harmand says, are ""sophisticated enough that they are likely not from the first time"" that the creation of a stone tool was attempted. Above: Anvils found at the Lomekwi 3 site. The tools described in the study were largely used together with a common goal: creating flakes of stone with sharp edges, likely for cutting. Certain stones were used as hammers, and others were used as the ""cores"" that would be struck in the hope of knocking off sharp flakes. Other stones were used as anvils, upon which the cores were placed while striking. It appears that the tools' manufacturers held their hammers in two hands while striking down on the cores — a more rudimentary technique than what was used to create the stone tools we know of from 700,000 years later. ""It will force us [to rethink] what makes us humans."" ""Maybe they needed sharp flakes to cut or otherwise process new food resources, whether animal or vegetal,"" Harmand says. Or ""maybe they were using the cores to pound open nuts or bones."" Either way, she says, it represents a species' development of the ability to modify its environment, imagine and create tools, and then ""use those tools to solve problems and better survive."" The tools are distinct enough that the researchers have given them a name: Lomekwian, named after the Lomekwi 3 archeological site where they were found in West Turkana, Kenya. This name is meant, in particular, to distinguish these tools from the 2.6-million-year-old stone tools that researchers previously knew of, which went under the name Oldowan. Above: Hammerstones found at the Lomekwi 3 site. Paleoanthropologists who spoke with The Verge and were not involved in the study said that this is a major finding that changes how we view the Homo genus. One called it a ""game changer."" The other said it has ""revolutionary implications."" ""It will force us [to rethink] what makes us humans,"" Fernando Diez Martin, a University of Valladolid associate professor who was not involved in the study, tells The Verge in an email. He adds, ""Increasing knowledge of our remote past is casting doubts on previous certainties and is showing that the process of becoming what we are now is far more gradual than what we previously thought."" It's not evident who actually made these tools That said, this finding doesn't necessarily mean making large changes to how we view the genus. Early members of Homo are also seen as having a larger brain size, beginning to eat more meat, and possibly starting to use language. This finding only removes developing stone tools from the equation. ""If you're somewhat broader-minded as to what ought to characterize the genus Homo, then it shouldn't come as a big shock,"" William Kimbel, director of Arizona State University's Institute of Human Origins, tells The Verge. Kimbel, who was not involved in the study, says that it may turn out to be that Homo isn't defined by representing the first stone toolmakers, but by representing a ""complete reliance on stone tools as part of its adaptive suite."" There's still so much uncertainty because researchers don't know which ancestor these tools actually belong to — they may well belong to a species that we don't know about yet. No bones from hominins, the broader group including humans and their ancestors, were discovered at the site. ""We think there are older, even more rudimentary stone tools out there to be found."" But it should be easier to find tools like these from here on out, which could bring new information that answers these unknowns. ""All of us will be going out with fresh eyes, keeping our eye on the sediments for evidence of potential tools that are quite different"" from the tools previously known about, Kimbel says. Now that researchers have a new understanding of what to look for, it should ""absolutely"" be easier to identify these early tools in the future. Lewis, the co-author, says that looking for artifacts from between 3 million and 4 million years ago is now key to understanding the roots of the human genus, as well as what behaviors and characteristics come along with it. ""We think there are older, even more rudimentary stone tools out there to be found,"" Harmand says, ""and we will be looking for them over the coming field seasons.",0.7175851770314075,0.28241482296859255,0.9441288001626051,1035,4.8434782608695652,486,6.0555555555555554,0,0,Science

The new effort focuses on one migratory pathway Monarchs take during the year. Butterflies who winter in Mexico travel up through Texas during the spring, while subsequent generations make their way to Canada before eventually dispersing. Later generations travel back down the same route during the fall. However, due to factors like agriculture and climate change, populations along this route and others have dwindled by about 90 percent. Monarch butterfly populations have fallen by about 90 percent in recent years The I-35 corridor, which runs between Laredo, Texas and Duluth, Minnesota, will hopefully curtail those losses.

The finding could really come in handy, since females are the ones that bite, constantly hunting for blood to develop their eggs. For some of us, mosquitoes are merely an annoyance we can solve with a simple swat or two. But in many parts of the world they carry deadly diseases and are major threat to the health of a population. There are about 200,000 cases of yellow fever each year. And of these, 30,000 result in death. There has been a number of efforts over the years to solve this problem, but the process usually involves breeding a large number of mosquitoes — which can be time-consuming and costly — and releasing the sterile males into high-risk areas. To streamline this process, researchers tried to find a genetic switch that could turn females into males. They didn’t quite do that, but they did find a way to alter their genitals. The team discovered a male-determining factor gene called ""Nix"" in the Aedes aegypti species of mosquito. Aedes aegypti isn't known for carrying malaria, but it is responsible for spreading other deadly diseases like yellow fever, dengue fever, and the chikungunya virus. ""When we injected Nix into mosquito embryos, we found that more than two-thirds of the female mosquitoes developed male genitals and testes,"" says Brantley Hall, a computational biology researcher and co-author on the paper. And when the team removed the Nix gene from male mosquitoes, they developed female genitals. Scientists have known for about 70 years that there was a gene which controls a mosquito's sex, but no one was able to find it, according to lead author Zhijian Jake Tu, a professor of biochemistry in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences. There's so much information to sift through that it was simply too daunting of a numbers game. Zach Adelman, an associate professor of entomology and a co-author of the paper, likens the problem to a puzzle. Even if you have 700 pieces assembled, it can still be hard to make sense of the ones that remain. ""Jake and his students found a way to look in those pieces and find a really, really important gene just sitting there,"" Adelman says. ""That [gene] wasn’t part of the assembly because no one could find it. It looked like all the other pieces.""    The researchers did this by developing a much more effective computational method that examines information buried in what's referred to as the ""black hole"" of the genome — regions full of duplicate information that are extremely hard to sequence. It was there where they discovered Nix. Although scientists have performed many sterile male mosquito releases over the years, the practice is fraught with inefficiencies and extra costs. For example, companies that perform these releases have no way of breeding only males. ""They're throwing away half of the mosquitoes that they rear because they’re females,"" Adelman says. ""If we have a strain that doesn’t even make females then you don’t have to spend all the labor costs associating with separating those out, and you don’t have to spend the money rearing them and then throwing them away."" Adelman says they are still a ""number of years"" away from perfecting the method. Right now they are only able to activate this male-determining gene by changing it in mosquito embryos, which means that the gene doesn’t always reach all the cells. As a result of this, the rest of the adult bodies weren't completely converted to male form. The team wants to get past modifying embryos and eventually exploit this male-determining factor by using transgenics, essentially changing this specific gene in mosquitoes on a deep enough cellular level that they pass it on to any offspring. ""You would have a much stronger effect,"" Tu says. ""It could be a converted, full, sterile male."" If the team can get to this point, the efficiency of mass releasing sterile males would drastically increase. When that day comes, we'll have our best weapon yet in the fight against mosquito-borne diseases.",0.37574899034979203,0.624251009650208,0.8567639634923797,700,4.9342857142857142,370,5.948648648648649,0,2,Science

And many kids who do receive some treatment receive ""too little."" More children with depression were prescribed antidepressants in 2012 than in 1996, according to a study published today in the New England Journal of Medicine. That's worrisome, since treatment guidelines suggest monitoring a child's behavior as a first line of treatment. Of course, the changes may also reflect a decreased stigma around depression, or an increased awareness that depression can strike young. Fewer than half of young people with severe mental health impairment received treatment for these problems in 2012, despite the considerable suffering associated with leaving these issues untreated, remarks Michael Schoenbaum, an epidemiologist at the National Institute of Mental Health who didn’t work on the study. And many kids who do receive some treatment receive ""too little,"" he says — or the wrong kind. Right now, about one out of five children experience a mental disorder each year, according to the CDC. And the US spends about $247 billion on the treatment of childhood mental disorders. These disorders — conditions like autism spectrum disorder, ADHD, and depression — are common, and they're costing kids a lot, both economically and emotionally. That's why it's crucial for researchers to get a handle on how good we are at spotting these issues early on, and providing kids with the care they need. In the study, researchers looked at data from over 50,000 youths age six to 17, gathered through three nationally representative surveys of parents spanning 1996 through 2012. The surveys asked the parents a number of questions about behavioral issues their child might be experiencing, in addition to questions about their children’s medical diagnoses. one out of five children experience a mental disorder each year By analyzing the parents’ answers, the scientists determined that the percentage of youths who are receiving outpatient mental health treatment increased to 13.3 percent from 9.2 percent over a period of 16 years. In addition, the rates of treatment increased more for non-white kids, which is encouraging given that the initial treatment rates were disproportionately low for non-white youths, Schoenbaum says. The biggest increase was seen in kids with more severe impairments, however —  meaning kids with impairments that impact their education and their interactions with others. That number grew to 43.9 percent in 2012 from 26.2 percent in 1996. The survey also asked parents about their kids' medications. The results show that the proportion of kids taking drugs like stimulants, antidepressants, and antipsychotics increased to 8.9 percent from 5.5 percent. This contrasts with other reports that found that use of antidepressant medications among young people declined or at least leveled off after the FDA’s issued a warning about potential health risks in 2004, Schoenbaum notes.   Olfson et al. (2015) ""We looked at the fraction of kids who received any antidepressants, but not the number or quantity of antidepressant prescriptions they received,"" says Mark Olfson, a psychiatrist at Columbia University and a co-author of the study published today. This could explain at least a portion of the difference in results. Previous studies also didn’t look at the 16-year period presented here, he says. So although there may have been a dip in prescriptions after 2004, this study may actually be showing a subsequent rebound. The proportion of youths taking psychotropic medications increased And it wasn't just severely ill kids who were prescribed medication more often, either. A greater proportion of kids with ""less severe or no mental health impairment"" were taking drugs in 2012, compared with rates recorded in 1996. This is concerning because clinical guidelines recommend active monitoring rather than anti-depressant use as a first approach in the care of children and adolescents who suffer from depression and exhibit mild-to-moderate symptoms, the authors write. But Schoenbaum isn’t as worried by this finding because he says that it's possible that the results are actually indicating a benefit resulting from the care they're receiving — care that also includes drugs.  ""A child might have little or no impairment because she or he has been receiving treatment,"" he says. What’s particularly interesting is that while the number of kids using mental health services increased, there was also a gradual, but significant decrease in the percentage of kids with serious forms of mental health impairment — a result that Schoenbaum calls ""surprising"" given recent and contradictory results from the CDC.  ""A smaller percentage of parents told us that their kids have this severe impairment.""  Over time, ""a smaller percentage of parents told us that their kids have this severe impairment,"" Olfson says. Other studies have focused on the number of diagnoses that children receive — a number that may say more about the kind of access they have to care rather than the number of kids displaying symptoms of severe mental health impairment. ""We don't know the cause of this change, and it sort of cuts against what I think is a common perception, that in recent years there's been an increase,"" Olfson says. There have been a lot of reports describing an increase in ADHD and autism among kids, and it's generally been assumed that these diagnoses are becoming more common, he says. ""But we find, in a general way, that the reverse is true,"" he says. There are some limitations to this work. For one thing, the latest survey was conducted between 2010 and 2012, ""and the world's changed some since then — whether these trends will continue to the present day, we certainly don't know that,"" Olfson says. The study also didn’t break down the data into specific mental health problems, like ADHD and depression, so it’s hard to know what some of the parents’ answers mean. Finally, Olfson points out that the survey doesn’t give the researchers much information about why these changes are occurring. ""So we see that more kids are being treated, but we still have a lot of kids with serious problems who aren't receiving treatment — and we don't know why."" ""It looks like we’re moving in the right direction."" The study was well done overall, Schoenbaum says. ""The authors were careful and responsible in their analyses and in their findings and conclusions."" And, more importantly, the results are encouraging. Given the increase in outpatient mental health service use among kids with serious mental health impairment and the apparent decline in frequency of such impairment, ""it looks like we’re moving in the right direction,"" he says. But even with these changes, the majority of young people with serious mental health impairment aren’t receiving help from trained professionals. ""At minimum, this highlights that there are still high levels of unmet need for mental health care among young people,"" Schoenbaum says — even if it may also be the case that some young people receive drugs despite having little or no mental health impairment.",0.6134295169542379,0.38657048304576214,0.18685281032393164,1180,5.2491525423728813,519,6.425818882466281,0,2,"Science, Report"

This, even though as I said, I don’t remember them. I don’t even remember the other children in the program. If I do something clumsy or awkward, a sort of mental flag pops up in my head, and it bears a chimp’s face. Once someone caught me, at 13, picking my nose in school: was that a lingering habit from my time among the chimps? Our family cats hated me because I could not keep my hands off them; even more than usual for a small child, I always wanted to pick them up. Perhaps furry things seemed more welcoming to me than they did to other children. In my early 20s, I caught myself sitting cross-legged at a desk chair. That’s a regular habit of mine, but on that day I happened to be sitting in a courtroom — as counsel at a defense table. I blamed the chimps then, too. But that’s what I tell myself, of course. I don’t tell others about the chimps much. For one thing, I have a lingering adolescent fear that it makes me sound a little weird. For another, I hardly recall the details of the study. Then there’s this: ""I don’t think I ever said they were chimps,"" my dad said recently, with a parental casualness I tried not to find infuriating. I’m quite sure he did, actually, but this is one of those times when it’s safer, as a daughter, to concede that perhaps I made that up. I don’t have it on tape. My parents did not document the experience in any way and can’t really be faulted for it. At the time, they had no inkling that their small daughter would one day grow up to be a journalist who would want to see the transcript, so to speak. Here is what I do know: my father had heard of the study on a campus flyer and went through the work of enrolling me because, he says, he thought it was an ""opportunity."" And so my mother took me twice a week to a building in the southwest corner of the University of Waterloo campus in Ontario, Canada. Inside, she remembers, was a large glass enclosure with a fake tree in it. She says sometimes she recalls seeing monkeys in that tree, but she admits her memory is spotty. (Near as I can tell, the monkeys were probably macaques.) And then she would leave me for a few hours in the care of some students. The way my mother saw it, she got to do her shopping in peace while I got to play with monkeys. Not that she ever witnessed me doing so herself. Once I went through the doors, that was it. It went on for months. ""You liked it, you were always happy to go,"" my mother insists. I’ve been asking her about this for years, always hoping she would remember something else about it. My parents remember few specifics. If I discussed my monkey-day activities with them as a toddler, everyone has forgotten the particulars of the conversation. Neither of my parents can even recall the nature of the study. Psychology, they think. Or sociology. But it was a long time ago, and they didn’t keep the papers they remember signing. Nor did they keep the report my father is vaguely persuaded he got, but then (I hope he’ll forgive me for printing this) he is a man prone to filling the gaps of his memory with things that never happened. So, this story I’ve always told myself about myself might not be quite true. But as it receded from my parents’ memories, it became imprinted on me. And now I’m stuck with it. From the time I arrived at university myself in the late 1990s, I’ve been trying to find any trace of ""my"" study. I have Google Scholared and PubMedded and Ovided. I even looked at paper indexes, once upon a time. I have scoured the research journals across several different disciplines. Whatever happened to me, no one published a word about it. I did manage to find a lot of studies about other children, though. Clinical psychological experimentation on children dates back to at least 1919. This was the dawn of the behaviorist school of psychology, an approach that begins from the premise that most psychoanalytic ""knowledge"" — your Freud and Jung — is hand-waving at best. The problem with psychoanalysis, behaviorists think, is that first-person reporting is unreliable. The objective information about human behavior, they say, comes from direct observation. So behaviorists were great fans of the experiment, and there were no subjects more guileless, or more perfectly primed for observation, than children. Though their real names were rarely revealed, many of these children became famous among academic circles. Or perhaps infamous, as these studies eventually became legendary less for the findings they contained than for the way subsequent generations came to question the ethics of studying children at all. John B. Watson, of Johns Hopkins University, was one of the ""fathers"" of this stuff; Watson would eventually become a household name as a parenting expert. As a behaviorist, he needed to show that parents had a direct, observable effect on their children’s development. Psychologists had already observed that infants don’t have as rich a range of emotional responses to the world as adults do. So Watson set out to see if he could teach one of those responses. Specifically, he wanted to see if he could teach a baby to fear animals. A Hollywood casting agent could not have chosen a more Platonic-ideal sort of baby for Watson’s experiment than a child known as Albert B. — his real name was kept concealed. Watson couldn’t stop himself from bragging in the paper he’d publish that the child was, ""one of the best developed youngsters ever brought to the hospital, weighing 21 pounds at nine months of age."" The child’s perfection was not just physical either — he also had a steady mind: ""on the whole stolid and unemotional."" Albert B. remained placid when researchers sat him in a room and presented him with a rat, a rabbit, a dog, and a monkey. In fact, in a film of the experiment, he seems quite taken with the rat and rabbit. In the manner of babies, he’s a bit distractible, but not at all afraid of the furry creatures of varying sizes put before him. So Watson got himself a hammer and a bar of steel. Then he presented Albert B. with the rat again. He hit the bar hard, making a loud noise to startle the child. Albert B. didn’t cry at first — he simply fell forward. When the scientists brought the rat out a second time and tapped the bar again, Albert B. whimpered. Within a few days, Albert B. would visibly tense up and fall over when presented with the animals, even if the loud noise did not accompany them. Often, he would cry spontaneously as soon as he saw them. This was the result Watson was looking for: he had taught Albert B. to fear rats, and the fear seemed to extend to other small animals. And Albert’s fearful reaction lasted, ""although with a certain loss in the intensity of the reaction, for a longer period than one month."" Watson published his study with a co-author; it became famous. Viewed through our modern lens, a certain aura of heartlessness attaches to a man willing to directly instill a phobia in babies, even to prove a scientific point. In the published findings, Watson comes across as more thoughtful and careful than that. He rationalized that he had chosen Albert B. carefully. ""His stability was one of the principal reasons for using him as a subject in this test,"" he wrote. ""We felt that we could do him relatively little harm by carrying out such experiments as those outlined below."" But it can be hard to judge when harm is inflicted on a person’s interior life. Watson didn’t spend much time observing Albert B. The experiment lasted until the infant was a little over a year old, but then Albert B. left the hospital, never to be heard from again. Watson, believing all his subjects had to be kept anonymous, burned his own papers. The identity of Albert B. stayed lost in those ashes until relatively recently. At first, researchers trying to reconstruct Albert B.’s identity thought perhaps he was a child named Douglas Merritte, who had hydrocephalus and died a few years after the experiment concluded. This never quite seemed to fit, because Watson had been so adamant about Albert B.’s health. Last year, as reported in the Chronicle of Higher Education, the strongest candidate yet appeared: Albert Barger. Allegedly, Barger went on to live a life as a salesman and devoted uncle. He never had children and died in 2007. But researchers found a niece who, when interviewed, indeed confirmed that he had harbored a lifelong dislike of dogs and animals. The adult Albert Barger didn’t chalk that up to Watson, though; instead, he told a story of a family dog that had died in front of him when he was young. Having apparently never been told about the experiments, he hadn’t incorporated them into his picture of himself, as I did. If Albert Barger is the right Albert B., though, his circumstances raise more questions. At the time of the experiment, Pearl Barger, Albert’s mother, worked as a wet nurse at the Harriet Lane Home in Baltimore. It was one of the nation’s first children’s homes; it was also where Watson had his lab. Pearl Barger was just 16, which opens the question of whether or not she gave any meaningful kind of consent to what happened to her child. In the film of the experiment, the mother isn’t present; the woman you see onscreen is Rosalie Rayner, Watson’s co-researcher and mistress, and eventual wife. That seems to be an appropriate representation of Pearl Barger’s involvement in the experiment: at most, she seems to have offered silent assent. Perhaps there was more. But it is hard to imagine someone in Barger’s position — an unwed mother, a teenager, whose very keep was being paid by the hospital where Watson was a powerful figure — having the full capacity to turn this sort of thing down. It is hard to imagine him sitting down to explain the even very minimal risks of this study to her. For much of the 20th century, the subjects of human experimentation were often people like Pearl and Albert: they were at some measurable social disadvantage to the people who were conducting the research. We became aware of the horrible things scientists could be tempted to do by the starker examples of Josef Mengele’s experiments on concentration camp inmates in the Second World War, or the Tuskegee syphilis trials, which were active all the way up to 1972. Those examples bequeathed us sets of ethical rules to follow. The signature principle of modern research ethics is the belief that a subject must be able to consent to an experiment before the trial proceeds. The first line of the Nuremberg Code, for example, holds that: ""The voluntary consent of the human subject is absolutely essential."" All the codes that followed — the Belmont Report, the various codes used by research universities — also enshrine that principle. This is as true of psychological research as it is of more traditional avenues of medicine. Gradually we have developed it into what we call, everywhere from emergency rooms to Grey’s Anatomy, ""informed consent,"" though it can be difficult to pin down exactly what’s meant by that. With kids, the issue of consent is thornier. It’s always hard to gauge what children ""know"" about their own situation and condition: even when they say ""yes,"" it may be no more meaningful an agreement than the one they’d give if you offered them a meal-ruining ice cream. If someone had asked me, at two, if I wanted to play with monkeys, I’m sure there would have been no image of danger in my mind and I would’ve happily consented. But it was really up to my parents to agree for me. Some might argue that allowing parents to make such decisions for their children is too paternalistic. Biomedical ethicists have developed a justification for that, though: they call it the principle of ""beneficence."" Basically, if the benefits of research to the subject seriously outweigh the risks, it helps justify the research. But, as even the Belmont Report admits: ""A difficult ethical problem remains, for example, about research that presents more than minimal risk without immediate prospect of direct benefit to the children involved. Some have argued that such research is inadmissible, while others have pointed out that this limit would rule out much research promising great benefit to children in the future."" The report concludes, lamely, that this means researchers have ""difficult choices"" before them when it comes to conducting research on children. Even if we viewed parental consent as a universal salve, there are still the circumstances of the parents to consider. Take my own. As we were all at Waterloo in the post-ethics code era, they remember signing releases. They were full-fledged adults, in their 30s. But I still think some of their nonchalance about all this can be traced to where they came from. Both of my parents grew up in rural Québec in the 1950s and 1960s, when it was something of a closed society. Most members of my extended family never went to university, never travelled much. My father was only at the University of Waterloo on a military scholarship; he’d dropped out of high school in his teens. In fact, he had only gotten his diploma when the Air Force made him do it while stationed in Germany in the mid '70s. Then, they discovered, he had a serious aptitude for math and science and sent him on through a master's degree so he could build CF-18 flight simulators. So I happened to be born just as my parents had stepped into a world much wider than the ones they’d been born to. Let me be clear that I don’t think my parents were naïve or ignorant. I also don’t think they were wrong in the least to sign me up for the study. But their wanting me to attend that day care, the way my dad always speaks of it as an ""opportunity,"" it had a context. I can’t help but think that most things looked like opportunities to my dad just then. He was already living a kind of life that he hadn’t dreamed up for himself. I don’t believe there was ever any risk of serious harm from ""my"" study; but even if there had been, I wonder if I would even feel it now. There’s another experiment people often cite: the 1939 ""Monster Study"" at the University of Iowa. That is not, of course, what Mary Tudor, the researcher in question, called it. Her master's thesis was titled, ""An experimental study of the effect of evaluative labeling of speech fluency."" She was a student of a man named Wendell Johnson. Johnson had stuttered in his youth. He had a theory that stuttering could be conditioned — meaning that people could be ""taught"" to stutter. He sent his student Tudor out to prove it by experimenting with a group of children from an Iowa orphanage. There were 22 of them in the study, ranging in ages from five to 15. Ten of them had already been identified as stutterers. The children were told they were going to receive speech therapy. Tudor split them into four groups. Two of the groups, IA and IB, contained the stutterers. The other two, IIA and IIB, contained non-stutterers. In each set, one group was comforted and told they spoke well; the other was told they stuttered. The group that led Tudor’s fellow graduate students to call this the ""monster study"" was IIB, the non-stutterers who were nonetheless told that they stuttered, and cautioned to be careful about how they spoke. After a few sessions with Tudor, the children became incredibly self-conscious; they sometimes refused to speak at all; they suffered at school. The experiments lasted only six months, and none of the children in the IIB group ultimately became stutterers — although, as Tudor herself admitted, ""we certainly made a definite impression on them."" Apparently, she felt bad enough that long after she reversed course and told the children their speech patterns were normal, she continued to visit them to see if they were getting along all right. In 2001, a reporter for a California newspaper named Jim Dyer came across reports of the study. The results had never really been published, beyond Tudor’s research thesis. He found one of the subjects, Mary Nixon, who still remembered the study. At the reporter's behest, Nixon sent Tudor a letter accusing her of outright abuse. ""I couldn’t never tell my husband about it,"" Mary Nixon would later tell a New York Times Magazine reporter. ""It just ruined my life."" National press coverage ensued. Dyer, the reporter, was eventually fired because he‘d tricked his way into university records by posing as a graduate student. That was how he obtained the names of the study participants. As for the subjects, they now all knew about what had happened to them as orphans as they hadn’t before; their reaction to this new bit of self-knowledge, coming after so long a silence, was outrage. They sued the University of Iowa, which settled in 2007 for over $900,000 to be split among the five living study participants. None of these children grew up to be stutterers. Their claims were simply that they had low self-confidence as the result of being berated as children. Yet they were also all orphans, which you might imagine could also lead to some self-esteem problems. You do not have to pity the University of Iowa — which admitted to wrongdoing, paid up, and formally apologized for the project — to suspect that the causes of the children’s unhappiness were more intricate than anyone could allow. The public furor over the Monster Study is instructive of how much attitudes have changed over time. If the experiment’s procedures had simply been reported in the press in the 1940s, it’s hard to believe that anyone would have blinked. But by 2001, everyone agreed instantly that what had happened to those children was an outrage. Historians love irony, and there’s plenty here. Because the very thing your Watsons and Tudors set out to prove — that what happens to a child can change her for life, whether it gives her a fear of animals or a stutter — is now an article of faith for parents everywhere. Everyone believes that, in the poet Philip Larkin’s famous formulation, ""they fuck you up, your mum and dad."" And given that we all now think that way, doing psychological research on children now seems to involve risks at once incalculable and giant. In other words: why expose your children to something new if you can’t control what it will do to them? Parents can’t be blamed for their aversion. Behavioral research on children is still done, of course, but the awareness of the risks has muted it. Peruse lists of recent articles in journals of behavioral research and you’re more likely to find mild and unquestionably benevolent-sounding studies, like ""Healthy Living Interventions in a Residential Girl Scout Camp"" or ""An intervention to preschool children for reducing screen time: a randomized controlled trial."" But what’s funny is that I don’t know that there are any lingering effects from my monkey day care. I can imagine them, but the only one that has actually proven to bother me is how frustrated I am that some intriguing part of my own development has been forever lost to me. In the last few months, I have contacted people at the University of Waterloo, trying to find out what exactly this whole monkey study was. The problem is, 1981 was a long time ago. Everyone’s gone on, and I don’t have a researcher’s name. Even if I did, it probably wouldn’t help. Waterloo’s Research Ethics Office wrote me back with this spectacularly unhelpful remark: ""Unfortunately, research data files, including details about participant identities, are the confidential property of the researcher involved."" They ignored my next question, about whether that meant they couldn’t even confirm the existence of a study. Finally, I called the press office. Their media relations guy, a kind Australian named Nick Manning, spent a few days trying to track the story down himself. At first, he got a lot of denials. The university, he said, would never have allowed children to be in close contact with monkeys. My parents must be mistaken; perhaps there’d been some comparative study between the behavior of toddlers and animals, but no one now remembered it happening. Manning was able to confirm one element of what my parents had told me: the University of Waterloo definitely owned a colony of macaque monkeys in the early 1980s. The people who remembered them, he said, insisted that they would have been hidden from public view, that children never would have been let near them. I had already known about the macaques, which seem the likeliest candidates for ""my"" monkeys; by the mid-1990s, they’d been mentioned as part of a well-publicized scandal about the ill-treatment of research animals in university labs across Canada. The rise of public awareness about that very issue probably got them sent off to wilderness preserves — like many other Canadian research animals. A day after we initially spoke, though, Manning called me back. He said that he’d spoken to someone who did remember the monkeys being visible behind glass, and who wouldn’t rule out the possibility that children had been brought there to see them. But still no one remembered anything specific. And of course memory is a fragile thing. Confidentiality in research important, and I am not an overly cautious luddite who thinks that all child research should grind to a halt in the face of ethical conundra. But still, sitting here at the end of an inquiry that brought almost no answers, the word my mind repeats to itself is disclosure, disclosure, disclosure. Put less bureaucratically: I just feel like I had some right to know more.

When they docked in New York last week, the six-man crew of the MOD70 Race for Water had just passed through one of Earth's five ""trash vortexes"" — circular oceanic currents, also known as gyres, that have collected thick layers of floating plastic debris. For the next nine months, they'll be helping document some of the worst things humanity has done to the environment. But speeding along the Hudson River, against a backdrop of Manhattan skyscrapers, they’re just a group of sailors showing off their sleek racing boat to a group of excited (if slightly shaky) passengers. Race for Water is a nonprofit group founded by Swiss entrepreneur Marco Simeoni. With five other crew members and a host of supporters back on land, he’s attempting to traverse each of the gyres over the course of 300 days, gathering trash samples and mapping pollution with drone photography. The boat left from Bordeaux, France last month, and between research stops at vortex-bound islands, the team will dock in places like Capetown, Shanghai, and Rio de Janeiro, trying to spread awareness of plastic pollution. Visiting the MOD70 requires a little preparation. After putting on a full-body windbreaker, life jacket, and helmet, I joined a few other people in an inflatable motorboat, heading roughly toward the Statue of Liberty. Reaching the trimaran a few minutes later, we jumped out and got used to the feel of walking on a springy rope net. Besides some plastic panels in the cockpit, there’s not a lot of solid footing aboveboard. From the shore, it’s hard to imagine how little space six people really have on the boat. Down a ladder, the living area starts feeling cramped after a few minutes, its walls lined with clothes, equipment, and a miniature kitchen. There are only two bunks. Back upstairs, we all have to duck the ropes, cables, and sails above our heads. But under the net floor, the whole river spreads out around us. According to Race for Water’s site, the wind-powered boat can theoretically reach speeds of 43 knots, or 50 miles per hour. Sailing World has reported a more conservative 35 knots for the MOD70 line. Skimming circles between New York and New Jersey, it edges up to the mid-20s. When we’re racing past a ferry full of tourists, this still feels pretty fast. No one knows exactly how many empty bottles, plastic bags, and takeout containers (to name a few kinds of plastic debris) have slipped into the world’s oceans. A 2015 Science study estimated that out of roughly 275 million metric tons of plastic waste produced in 2010, between 4.8 and 12.7 million metric tons of it ended up in oceans. Wherever it’s from, trash from the coast drifts into the eyes of the gyres, slowly breaking into fine beads. References to ""garbage islands"" conjure images of some new plastic continent, but it’s generally a far less dramatic trash-studded sludge. This doesn’t necessarily make it less harmful. ""It's more than an eyesore,"" said Nancy Wallace, director of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s marine debris program, at the press conference. ""I would say it's one of the biggest threats facing our oceans today. It kills wildlife, it damages habitats, it can be an issue for mariners out on the open ocean, and it costs communities a lot of money."" The most famous gyre is the Great Pacific garbage patch, which has been scouted extensively by sailor and researcher Charles Moore. But another patch sits south of it, and three more are scattered across the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. Simeoni and his team have made plans to stop at islands in each, measuring the density and location of debris. So far, their trip has taken them to the Azores and Bermuda, both within range of the North Atlantic Gyre. To measure the amount of plastic in an environment, the team digs up small squares of beach soil at each island, gathering a sample that’s usually heavily laced with plastic particles. There’s also another, more futuristic option: drone mapping. The boat carries a SenseFly eBee, an autonomous aircraft that looks like a 3-foot-wide, foam stealth bomber. To scout an area, the team throws it into the air, where it shoots high-resolution photos along a predetermined flight path. With the help of researchers at Duke University and Oregon State University, those pictures can be assembled into a flat collage or a 3D topographical map. Ari Friedlaender, an associate professor at Oregon State University and adjunct at the Duke University Marine Laboratory, says drones are cheap and small but deliver useful information. ""We're going to be able to quantify ocean plastics or things on the beach down to about 2- or 3-centimeter resolution,"" he says. That means figuring out how much garbage there is, where it might be coming from, and how conservationists could eventually stop it. Race for Water isn’t a lone effort. In addition to universities, it’s collaborating with organizations like the United Nations Environment Program. ""Together, we will be more strong, and I hope we have a better voice in front of the political decision makers,"" explained Simeoni at the conference. Wallace praised the team’s attempt to capture usable data. ""One of the things I think is so important is the science behind marine debris,"" she said. That includes simply learning where debris is and how much is out there. ""We're really excited they're using our scientific protocols to actually get real data."" Simeoni’s trip is one of several efforts to map plastic debris, but it can’t solve the problem of them on its own. Understanding the extent of the pollution is only the first step, and fixing it will take a worldwide attempt to cut down on plastic waste. For the past few years, NOAA and UNEP have been promoting a framework called the Honolulu Strategy, which includes developing education programs, building new infrastructure to handle debris, and conducting clean-up missions around the coast. If keeping new plastic out of the oceans is hard, shrinking the existing garbage patches is an even more difficult proposition. But Simeoni hopes that his data and publicity efforts will be enough to get the world to take notice, whether that’s with drone data or an eye-catching watercraft. ""Learning more about the issue is what's going to help us solve the problem. But the other real, key piece to solving marine debris is going to be prevention,"" said Wallace. ""The only way we're going to be able to do that is through awareness. And what this expedition is doing is raising a lot of awareness, globally.""",0.4110830715263901,0.5889169284736099,0.8547795602008081,1124,4.9982206405693947,654,6.2094801223241589,0,18,"Transportation, Photo Essay, Report"

The message, ""Steph [hearts] U,"" was written across the bone-dry expanse of Nevada's Delamar Dry Lake; the company notes that the message is bigger than one and a half Central Parks, all told. It's huge — so big, in fact, that Guinness has certified it as the world's ""largest tire track image.""  Here's the message as seen from space:   Hyundai isn't disclosing which astronaut was involved — probably because NASA doesn't take kindly to commercial promotion — but it's a pretty cool trick nonetheless. (Let's just hope it's a little less destructive to the environment than Greenpeace's stunt in Peru.)

Classic red? A nice suave black? Garish yellow, to beat your Lambo-owning friends at their own game? Finally, there's an answer. Ferrari has joined forces with developer Zspace to create the Ferrari AR showroom app, software that uses 3D tracking technology to recognize real-world cars and superimpose shapes, colors, and videos onto their real-time images. The app lets customers in Ferrari showrooms hold a tablet in front of their chosen vehicle and virtually change the rims, brakes, and paint job, building a custom specification for their new ride without the dealership needing to order it in. The app uses 3D tracking technology built by augmented reality specialists Metaio, and has seven ""feature spotlights"" that customers can select, including an X-ray view of the selected car that shows its components, a 3D breakdown of the brake assembly, and a visualization of the vehicle in a wind tunnel. Select the brakes option on the app, for example, and wheel pops out from its housing, displaying the brakes and screws that hold it in place. Metaio's technology is able to detect the car by tracking its edges. When the device housing the app is pointed at a Ferrari, it judges the distances between its panels, wheel arches, and other parts of its chassis, before overlaying the chosen graphics. Hold the device steady, and prospective Ferrari purchasers can change the car's color on the fly, using the augmented reality tech to repaint it without needing to leave the showroom.  Edge tracking technology has been used by car manufacturers before. In 2013, Volkswagen worked with Metaio to develop augmented reality software that showed technical information for the German manufacturer's hybrid concept XL1 car in real-time, visualizing real and virtual parts side-by-side on a tablet pointed toward the vehicle. For the moment, the new Ferrari app works with five models — the 458 Speciale and Spider, the FF, the California, and the F12berlinetta — but the car manufacturer could conceivably use the technology for the rest of its range, too. (Not to say you'll see many unsold LaFerraris in dealerships.) American customers will have to wait a while before they can see their augmented reality Ferraris, though — the app's being rolled out in Japanese and Australian showrooms first, but will make its first appearance in the US at the upcoming InsideAR augmented reality show in mid-May.",0.7504600933668488,0.24953990663315118,0.693327199320135,419,5.107398568019093,247,6.0404858299595139,0,0,"Apps, Tech, Transportation"

Worried about the impending crowd and the limited parking, I arrived an hour before that. I paid $20 to leave my rental car in the parking lot of ""Will Call,"" a bar that was inexplicably still open but was conveniently located right behind the main grandstand. I gathered my camera gear and got out of the car, ready for a 12-hour day of watching electric race cars carve their way around the streets of Miami. It was at that moment I realized there was a family of four parked next to me in a mini-van doing the same thing. In the dark. At 6AM.  While Will Call was still finishing up last call.   The point I'm making is that — even though Formula E is a brand new series that lacks a true international star, even though the cars turn most motorsports fans off because they eschew combustion engines for electric ones, even though that means there's ""no sound"" — something big is happening here just six races into the sport's inaugural 11-race season. Formula E is probably already a success on a number of measurable levels, but if anything, it's at least already successful enough to make families try to get to the event before the sun is up. That's impressive, especially considering that legacy racing series like NASCAR — which at its peak brought around 100,000 people to most races — are bleeding fans left and right. But it all makes sense once you've seen these cars in action. Granted, I was so close that my camera and I were being pelted by bits of rubber that used to belong to Michelin and bits of gravel that used to belong to the City of Miami. My enthusiasm might be more measured if I had sat in the grandstands instead. But I've seen enough racing at speedways big and small to know when I'm watching an exciting series and when I'm watching a dud. Formula E has to jump a lot of hurdles to achieve long-lasting success, and it's trying to do that at a time when basically every major motorsport in the world is on some sort of decline. But if the race in Miami was any indication of where it's going, it's off to a hell of a start.     A cameraman shoots out of one of the only available photo holes in the fence. The setup of the track was so rushed that almost none of these special sections of fencing were installed. The streets around the American Airlines Arena were under construction for more than a week in order to prepare for the race. The Miami street course was laid out around the American Airlines Arena, home to the Miami Heat. Fans drape the flag of Spain over their balcony railing in support of Virgin driver Jaime Alguersuari. Fans watched from the grandstands, the infield, and from behind just about every section of fencing around the track.  Richard Branson is one of the series's biggest champions. ""I hope 10 years from now, 20 years from now, the smell of exhaust will be as much a thing of the past as the smell of cigarettes in a restaurant,"" he said before the race. A racing engineer for Virgin Racing helps get Sam Bird's car set up. Bird, who's won a race already, attributes his success to the behind-the-scenes work. ""The guys are working flat-out,"" he said while we spoke the day before the race. They're also working on ideas for next year. ""If you're ever standing still in this sport, you're going backwards. You have to always be keeping an eye on the future,"" Bird says.  Formula E is such a globetrotting series that the cars are actually sent to each race location in giant DHL packages. Before and after each race, the cars are assembled, disassembled, and placed in these shipping containers. That means everything — from the tires, to the body work, to the lettering. Each car is put back together the day before each race. Members of the Amlin Aguri team roll Salvador Duran's car away from the inspection area. Nick Heidfeld makes some last-minute adjustments to his helmet before strapping in for the race. Amlin Aguri driver Salvador Duran and a member of his crew hop on scooters to take a lap of the course. The drivers spent a lot of time using scooters and bikes to drive the course while it was being built in order to get familiar with the layout. Legendary Formula One driver Alain Prost discusses race strategy with his son, Nico, who would go on to win the race in Miami. Vitantonio Liuzzi has a laugh with Michael Andretti and driver Scott Speed. Liuzzi had to fill in last minute for another driver, and was actually on vacation in Miami with his wife when he found out he was needed. Dozens of members of the media try to get a picture of the drivers, who assembled for a group photo. Open-wheel racing typically involves less contact than a stock car series like NASCAR, but Formula E is the exception. Tight street circuits and evenly matched cars mean there's lots of bumps, slams, and crashes. Track workers take a break from the heat while the first practice session gets underway. The track was still being completed right up until the beginning of the race. Karun Chandhok, who has driven in the Formula One and Le Mans series, takes a few laps around the course during the first practice session. The wheel of a Formula E car is, compared to the steering wheels of other series like Formula One, relatively low-tech in its appearance.  Nico Prost, the eventual race winner, set the third-fastest lap in qualifying. The crowd in Miami was an extremely diverse one. There was a handful of traditional race fans, but many people made the trip from outside the city. Most seemed unfamiliar with the series and racing in general.  António Félix da Costa speaks with a local reporter about the race. The drivers spent most of the day before the race working with the media. Track workers run through some final discussions before the race. As is the case with any type of racing, safety is paramount. Countless medics and firefighters were on hand should something have gone wrong. Locals watched from 20 stories up in the apartments and hotels that line Biscayne Blvd. Lucas di Grassi pulls into his spot on the starting grid on Biscayne Blvd. The first few laps of every Formula E race have been wild. All 20 cars are at their closest, and it's one of the best chances to overtake a number of positions.  Sam Bird leads drivers out of the straightaway and through the first turn. This spot in particular was where drivers did a lot of regenerative braking to make their batteries last a bit longer. Drivers battle in traffic as they turn up the hill toward the American Airlines Arena. Lucas di Grassi speeds past fans on the back straightaway. Right before the race started a yacht pulled into the space between Museum Park and American Airlines Arena, providing one of the most exclusive views of the race.

Formula E drivers speed north up Biscayne Blvd., past the paying crowd and people watching from their balconies. Track workers watch a driver speed down the main straightaway.  Bruno Senna, nephew of famous Formula One driver Ayrton Senna, handles a turn on the Miami course. His best finishes so far have been fifth place in Buenos Aires and Long Beach. Virgin Racing driver Sam Bird fights the car's rough handling in one of the turns. ""It’s a different form of motorsport, and it may not have a lot of sound, but it’s still exciting racing,"" he said the day before the race. The cars raced north along Biscayne Boulevard until they reached four turns that sent them under the 395 overpass. While most people in attendance had to pay to watch, many Miamians took refuge under the 395 overpass. It offered a great view of the cars as they fought through turn 4 before heading down Biscayne Blvd. towards the American Airlines Arena. Prost leads the field down the front straightaway late in the race. Miami was his first win in the series — he led most of the inaugural race in Beijing until he caused a wreck in the final turn.

What SpaceX is trying to do is not easy The company first attempted to land on the drone ship back in January. The rocket nearly hit its target, but the fins that are supposed to slow and guide its descent ran out of hydraulic fluid. The result was a descent that was so rapid and imbalanced that the entire first stage erupted in a massive fireball after it impacted the barge. SpaceX had a second attempted landing scheduled for February. The launch was successful, but rough seas forced the company to bring the drone ship back to port. Instead of an attempted landing, the Falcon 9 lowered itself to where the barge was supposed to be, briefly hovered, and promptly sank. While the company does have another Falcon 9 launch scheduled for late next week, that rocket will be delivering a communications satellite to a higher orbit, which means it won't be able to test the first stage landing.

With the hot sun beating down on an anxious crowd, workers filed down bumpy manhole covers and used forklifts to put the last few concrete safety barriers in place.  The event had drawn tens of thousands of fans to a stretch of Biscayne Boulevard, creating a scene that evoked a time when the major open-wheel Grand Prix series occupied major American cities on a yearly basis. Away from the packed grandstands, some Miamians watched from a more bird's-eye view — residents hung flags over the balcony railings of their apartments 20 stories above the street, others watched from rooftops or from a massive yacht docked in the water next to the American Airlines Arena. The interest in the brand new series was obvious.  But the series wasn’t ready. A morning practice session had to be canceled, and even the race officials who worked for FIA — the sport’s governing body — were unclear when the track would be ready. It was, like the event itself, a race to the finish.  The action eventually got underway, but it underscored Formula E’s present reality: this is an experiment. It’s young, weird, crazy, brash. It might be described as a little confused (and a little confusing).  It’s also completely electric.   The race cars of Formula E call heavily on recent designs found in Formula One, which is to say they are gorgeous works of high technology. The bodies have been carefully shaped out of carbon fiber and aluminum by Dallara, the same company that supplies IndyCar with its current chassis. The powerful, ornate machines bring to mind an old racing adage: ""They look fast standing still."" But beneath their taut skins, the cars of Formula E are much different from those that make up the world’s most popular motorsport: they top out at just 140mph, run on treaded tires instead of racing slicks, and have fewer aerodynamic aids. They also weigh more — Formula E cars must run at a minimum of around 1,800 pounds including the driver, some 350 pounds heavier than an F1 car. Still, the biggest difference between Formula E and Formula One is also the most obvious, according to Virgin team driver Jaime Alguersuari. ""The main limitation is the same as we have in our iPhones: the battery,"" says Alguersuari, who has driven in both series. ""We have to try to keep the battery as cool as we can, and try to preserve it by using some driving techniques."" In fact, a major source of drama in each Formula E race is how well each driver manages their car’s battery. Even though the races last about an hour, the battery technology is still only good enough to let the drivers race for 25–30 minutes at a time. So halfway through each race, every driver has to stop in the pits and hop into a new car with a freshly charged battery. That means each half of the race is as much about energy efficiency as it is about the actual racing. If a driver goes all-out at the start in an effort to grab the lead, they risk running the battery down too low and too soon. If they race too conservatively, on the other hand, they could lose so much ground that they end up at the back of the 20-car pack. Overall, the battery limits may actually help Formula E. The shorter races are much more approachable to casual fans watching at the track or from the couch. An hour-long feature event is practically unheard of in motorsports; while IndyCar has tried to limit its own races to about two hours in recent years, NASCAR has morphed its broadcasts into NFL-style marathons. Both of those series are seeing major dips in television ratings and especially in attendance — NASCAR’s popularity problem is so bad that it’s stopped reporting attendance estimates, even as images of empty seats make it in to each broadcast.   Like Alguersuari, most drivers in Formula E come from multidisciplinary backgrounds, and almost all of them concurrently compete in other series. During any given Formula E race you’re watching drivers who’ve raced in Formula One, IndyCar, NASCAR, WRC, Global Rallycross, LeMans, and just about every other major motorsport imaginable. They’re not outcasts of these other series; this circulation is considered normal these days. Some Formula One drivers move to IndyCar, some IndyCar drivers move to NASCAR, and so on. Because of this, the drivers of Formula E’s inaugural season say the competition is already pretty stiff. ""You look up and down the grid, especially for this race, and there is not a single driver that you would say is slow,"" says Sam Bird, Alguersuari’s teammate at Virgin. He’s competed in the World Endurance Championship and a handful of series that serve as stepping stones to Formula One. ""It’s a staggering grid. In my opinion it’s as strong, if not stronger, than Formula One in terms of depth. All the drivers have achieved something great in their career."" The intensity of the competition is further enhanced by two big factors, the first of which is the decision only to race the cars on street circuits. These courses are typically full of sharp turns and are laid out in tight confines, often in the heart of a city. It also helps hide the cars’ limited top speed, while allowing the batteries to last longer: Formula E cars have regenerative braking, which partially recharges the battery by storing the energy created during deceleration. It’s how the cars are able to last about a half-hour before the battery completely drains, but it’s also why we won’t see them on an oval course any time soon, where braking is minimal. The other thing that fosters such rich competition is that all the cars are identically configured. Every team currently runs the same chassis, and only next season will certain parts of the car (like suspension) be opened up to customization. That slow-drip progress is intentional. Ever since he announced the series three years ago, Formula E’s CEO Alejandro Agag has had three clearly stated goals for the series: create exciting and competitive racing, to improve research and development around electric vehicles, and to eliminate the resistance that people have to the technology. ""People still don’t believe in electric cars,"" Agag told Bloomberg back in 2012. ""They don’t see them as a real option for their lives."" Not much has changed since then. Tesla, the EV market’s biggest cheerleader, just sold 10,000 cars in a calendar quarter — a drop in the bucket compared to traditional automakers. Virgin Group founder Richard Branson — one of Formula E’s most high-profile supporters — spoke about these challenges at the pre-race press conference in Miami. ""A lot of members of the public do not realize that electric cars can go 140mph,"" he said. ""A lot of members of the public don’t realize that electric cars can be sexy. And these cars are all of that."" But for fans and curious onlookers to experience any of this, there needs to be a race. Agag has compressed the entire Formula E race experience into just one day, which necessitates a harried symphony of activity simply to get these high-tech marvels underneath a green flag. Practice, qualifying, and the actual Formula E race start and end in a span of about 10 hours. The experience is a bargain: a general-admission ticket in Miami only cost about $25 (some seats went for higher), while the most recent US race in Long Beach, California, was completely free. In that respect, Formula E more closely resembles the way local short tracks around the US operate — get the fans in for cheap on a Saturday while making money on concessions, give them a ton of action in a short amount of time, and get them out. That's a stark contrast to other major motorsports, which spread practice and qualifying sessions across the days before the actual race, each of which can cost an extra fee to attend. The worst offender, NASCAR, spreads its action out so much that it practically demands its fans to spend a long weekend or more at a track. A full weekend at a NASCAR track can cost a family hundreds of dollars before the race even starts. The compressed schedule adds tremendous pressure on the drivers, which Bird says is by design. ""It’s important for Formula E as a brand to have wild, wacky, crazy races,"" he says. ""We sort of need that at the moment to get people interested."" To his point, almost everything about the experience is ""wild, wacky, crazy."" There’s the FanBoost competition, which uses online voting to give three drivers in every race the ability to briefly increase their horsepower limit. The series has ramped up an aggressive social media presence throughout the season, especially on Facebook where full race highlights and clips of spectacular moments are natively posted. There’s even a live DJ during each race — or ""EJ,"" as he’s called — who pumps music into speakers around the venue to help make up for the lack of engine noise. If that’s what Agag and the people behind Formula E really want — a day of insanity for drivers, teams, and a new generation of race fans — then they must be happy with the results so far. The tamest race of the season was the series’ premiere race in Beijing last September. It was a decent debut, but nothing terribly noteworthy happened until a terrifying crash in the final turn of the race when driver Nico Prost tried to block a charging Nick Heidfeld. ""Since that moment, the racing has been frantic,"" says Bird.   He’s right. The rest of the races have been excellent, with tons of side-by-side action that's been equal parts messy and thrilling. The manic racing has spawned six different winners in each of the first six races. And even though open-wheel racing series typically thrive in close competition that demands a lack of contact — the danger of exposed wheels is too great to allow the door-slamming action found in stock car series like NASCAR — Formula E drivers have not been shy about muscling their way around these street circuits. While the racing has been great, the most common complaint about Formula E was lodged well before the series even debuted: its sound, or the perceived lack of it. Traditional race fans love (or love to hate) the sound of combustion engines, and a series that lacks the rumbles and roars usually found in other motorsports is fighting an uphill battle. ""There’s always going to be standard combustion [engine] series out there, and we’re not trying to get rid of them,"" Bird says. ""There’s no reason why a fan can’t appreciate and love the so-called ‘normal’ concept of racing but at the same time appreciate and love what we’re doing here with our machines."" But let’s be clear: these cars aren’t silent. The electric motors produce a sound that is somewhere between that of a giant RC car and something out of The Jetsons. They might be whisper-quiet from few hundred yards away, but they register about 80 decibels when they zip by. That’s plenty of noise to get your heart pounding.   The tamer sound even offers a few advantages. You can actually hear the chirps and squeals of the tires as the cars fly around each corner, a stark reminder that the drivers’ lives hang in the balance at every turn. The reduced track noise means you don’t need to yell yourself hoarse while talking to your friends and family. There’s also no fussing around with earplugs, a common annoyance at any other race track. (Though, if you’re really close to the action, ear protection is still a good idea.) The biggest advantage might be that local governments are more likely to embrace a series that won’t fill their cities with noise and air pollution. In Miami, for example, you could hardly make out that anything special was happening from a few blocks away. Because of this, the young series is attracting a lot of attention — just last week, Agag told Autosport.com that over 180 cities have requested to hold a race, and the mayor of Montreal flew to the Miami race to stump for the series to come to his town next year. These cities have good reason to be interested, too. A report from Ernst & Young from 2013 regarding the race in Miami estimated that the event could generate $10 million in revenue for the city from 25,000 unique visitors. But if Formula E wants to maintain that intense interest, the organizers need to streamline how it all works. In Miami, the one-day turnaround nearly spelled disaster — major pieces of the course were still being assembled at 11AM on race day, three hours after the first practice was supposed to start. That delay meant a practice session had to be cut in order to keep with the 4PM start time, which was contractually tied to a live broadcast with Fox Sports. A heavy air of uncertainty hung all throughout the day from the paddock to the grandstands, with tensions amplified by the incessant soundtrack from the EJ.   Fans watch a construction crew lift the last bits of fence into place on the morning of the race.  The series also needs to increase the fans’ access to the drivers and cars. Kids and their parents in Miami were turned away from the paddock even well after the checkered flags waved, and that kind of up-close interaction is an enormous part of the experience offered by NASCAR and other American racing series. (At the race in Long Beach, FIA sold passes to the paddock but only for 30 or 40 minutes at a time.) The power of that kind of access shouldn't be ignored — even the Red Bull Air Race realized this, which is why the series started holding events at American speedways last year in order to improve its own fan outreach. There’s also just a general dearth of advertising for Formula E, and many people still don’t even know it exists. Even in Miami on the night before the race, locals were stumbling onto the unfinished course and wondering what they were looking at. But for the moment, the sport’s immediate future looks secure. Just last month, organizers secured a round of funding from cable mogul John Malone and his companies Liberty Global and Discovery Communications. While the amount wasn’t disclosed, it was apparently big enough to make them the largest shareholder in Formula E Holdings, the series’ parent company. Last year, Qualcomm was part of an investment round that raised €50 million (about $53 million). And a separate sustainability report from Ernst & Young estimated that the series could help drive almost 100 million EV sales by 2040. ""We’re at the ground floor of this technology,"" team owner Michael Andretti says. ""I believe in five years we’re going to be going twice as far twice as fast, and it’s all going to be because of the competition that you have on the race track."" Roger Penske, Michael Andretti, and Dario Franchitti chat in the paddock on race day. The involvement of famous motorsport names like these involved with Formula E is important in the early going. Once those kinds of milestones have been reached, Andretti says, consumers will see the benefits. ""That’s what auto racing did in the beginning with the automobile, and I think it’s going to happen here with the electric side of it,"" he says. With just a few races behind them, teams are already looking forward to improvements in technology, underscoring just how quickly the EV industry is moving. ""Some of the technologists that are working on our program believe that we can accelerate [energy density] about 8 percent a year, and that’s really phenomenal,"" says Alex Tai, team principal for Virgin Racing. Lucas di Grassi, who won the very first Formula E race in Beijing and currently sits atop the points standings, likes the series’ chances of shaping the way young people think about the automobile. ""When they think about buying their first car, they think about buying an electric car,"" di Grassi says. ""To change old minds that [think] V8s and V10s are the cars to get, it’s actually very difficult. But if the first car that you buy is electric, the chance of you staying with electric cars for the future is actually very high."" Ask other drivers about the big picture, however, and you get a much different answer. ""Where it’s going? What’s right? Is it going to be successful? Is it not? Psh, I’m just a dumb racing driver,"" says Scott Speed, who finished second in Miami. ""Steer the wheel and push the pedals.""

Starting this week, astronauts could get to drink fresh espresso More importantly, SpaceX is planning to test the company's reusable Falcon 9 (or Falcon 9R) rocket. Instead of losing the rocket's first stage in the ocean, the company hopes to use four fins to stabilize the rocket during its descent and 70-foot-wide landing legs to set it down gently — but not on solid ground. The rocket will instead aim for a 300-by-100-foot autonomous drone ship, which is already waiting in the ocean east of Cape Canaveral.   Odds of rocket landing successfully today are still less than 50%. The 80% figure by end of year is only bcs many launches ahead.  SpaceX lost its first Falcon 9R in a catastrophic explosion, but was almost a successful landing — which is wild considering that the company gave it no better than a 50 percent chance of succeeding. The rocket was nearly on target despite the fact that it ran out of hydraulic fluid, which caused the fins to fail, resulting in too fast a descent. The second Falcon 9R was lost at sea when rough weather kept the drone ship docked. Meanwhile, the ISSpresso machine was made by Italian coffee company Lavazza, in conjunction with an engineering firm and the Italian Space Agency. It won't provide any real nutritional benefit, but NASA officials have talked about its importance in keeping the inhabitants of the ISS happy and comfortable.

Unlike the small Stanford store, however, Omotesando has a basement level accessed by a trademark glass spiral staircase. Apple's other two Tokyo stores are in hip Shibuya and swish Ginza. Omotesando is somewhere between those two areas in status — a firmly upscale, expensive district with a younger demographic. It's also known for its incredible modern architecture, with labels like Tod's, Dior, and Prada constantly attempting to one-up each other with innovative building designs. The new store opening sees Apple further its image as a luxury brand to be spoken of in the same conversation as the world's most renowned fashion houses.   Omotesando's main street is lined with trees. Apple used leafy iconography in its boardings that covered the new store while it was under construction. Across the street is this new Hugo Boss store, which opened earlier in the year. It has an unusual, twisting design reminiscent of a concrete hourglass. The store opened on a strange day of weather in Tokyo, bouncing between scorching sun and torrential downpours. Pedestrians were split between carrying transparent umbrellas to stay dry or parasols to avoid a suntan.   Keeping the three glass walls spotless is no mean task. The new store has an airy, spacious design, and was surprisingly uncrowded on its first day. The store's centerpiece is this large Apple logo suspended from the ceiling. The spiral staircase is directly below the Apple logo. The translucent spiral staircase made its first appearance in another Japanese Apple Store; the Shinsaibashi, Osaka location opened just under ten years ago.

It’s drab, seedy, and has long been among the city’s poorest areas. Today, it’s home to a large immigrant population, mostly Turks, as evidenced by the kebab houses and hookah bars that line its gray streets. But the twin forces of change and gentrification are slowly seeping into Wedding, as they have across much of post-Cold War Berlin. The squat houses and calling-card stores are still there, though they’re interspersed now with galleries, remodeled apartment buildings, and artist studios. ""That used to be a gang house,"" says Steffen Sauerteig, pointing across a sleepy street at what appears to be a renovated theater. ""They had a big street fight with another gang a while ago. Now I think it’s an art space."" Sauerteig is no stranger to change. A tall, angular man with well-coiffed blonde hair, he grew up in East Berlin and entered adulthood just as the Wall began to crack. As a child, he dreamt about the culture and freedom that lay on the other side, and as a teenager, he was among the first to participate in demonstrations that would reunify Germany. As an adult, he helped create eBoy: the successful graphic design firm whose three co-founders and sole members — Sauerteig, Kai Vermehr, and Svend Smital — are widely regarded as the ""godfathers"" of pixel art. The trio came together here in Berlin during the mid-’90s, and have spent the last two decades honing their craft in meticulous detail, building elaborate cityscapes, portraits, and designer toys, one pixel at a time. Everything they create is governed by the same 8-bit style — a seemingly limited medium whose aesthetic arose from early video game culture — but what happens within those parameters is a mix of exuberance, geekiness, and boyish imagination: robots battle monsters, topless women dangle from street poles, zombies storm an Arby’s. Svend Smital As professionals, the ""eBoys"" seem to have found the holy grail of graphic design. Their work is instantly recognizable and consistently relevant. It’s paid off, too; the group’s client list reads like a primer in 21st-century consumerism: Coca-Cola, the New York Times, Paul Smith, MTV. When I met them for the first time in Berlin last fall, they were working on a campaign for Xbox. In the world of digital design, their mark has been indelible. ""eBoy are the originals,"" says Jürgen Siebert, CEO of FontShop, a Berlin-based typography company that the eBoy founders collaborated with in the early 1990s. ""Of course there are some more pixel wizards, and there had been before eBoy. But eBoy developed that discipline to perfection."" Yet to most, the men behind the pixels remain anonymous. They’ve done only a few interviews over the years, preferring to focus attention on their work rather than their personal lives. Their paths have been circuitous and at times tumultuous, but they found a unique equilibrium as eBoy, creating an 8-bit universe where ordered linearity coexists with joy and imagination. Outside their studio, things are gray and uncertain. Inside their world, they’re pretty close to perfect. It’s mid-October, and we’re strolling near the central borough of Mitte, along the yellow painted line that runs where the Berlin Wall once stood. There’s a distinct elegance to Sauerteig’s movements. He punctuates his sentences with slow twirls of the wrist, and has a tendency to push back his hair between thoughts. Smital, shorter and soft spoken with plaintive eyes, is walking alongside in a denim shirt and blue beanie, interjecting occasionally with anecdotes. Both men grew up in the same area of East Berlin, just a few blocks from one another, and became friends after meeting at a party as teenagers. They remained close after the wall came down in 1989 and eventually enrolled in art school together on the west side of the city. Today, they spend most of their waking lives sitting across from one another at their studio in Wedding, interacting with a wordless familiarity. Growing up, their primary exposure to Western culture came through John Peel’s radio shows, and as teenagers, they went to punk rock concerts held in darkened churches. They knew nothing of video games, and had never touched a computer. But they had hints of what was on the other side of the wall, and they knew it was always out of reach. ""When you grow up in a divided city like Berlin was at that time, it’s always in front of you, the fact that you live a restricted life,"" Smital said. ""It was normal for me back then because it was never different. But when I think about it now it’s very scary."" The son of a general in the East German army, Sauerteig became politically active in his teenage years, protesting against fraudulent elections at the early Leipzig demonstrations that would put the first cracks in the wall. After high school he worked as an electrician for East German television, but quit after a year because he grew tired of producing state propaganda. For a while, he made ends meet by selling hand-knit backpacks at markets with his wife. Smital wasn’t as politically active, though he shared Sauerteig’s desire to move west. He wanted to go to college, but didn’t want to serve the mandatory three years in the military beforehand. So he ended up working odd jobs, assisting photographers and taking tickets at horse races. When the wall came down in 1989, everything suddenly changed. ""The first time when I went to West Berlin, it was very colorful,"" Smital said. ""It sounds sort of cliché but it was really like that. You didn’t have all this advertising in the East. That could be  seen as annoying now, but back then it was something completely new and nice."" Sauerteig was 21 when Germany reunified, and his first child had just been born. His earliest recollections of West Berlin involve wandering up and down the aisles of a supermarket, mesmerized by the labeling and packaging of all the products. ""Everything was really black and white in the East,"" he said. ""All the buildings were worn down. No billboards, not even that many trees. In the West it was shiny, everything was colorful."" Smital and Sauerteig eventually enrolled together at the Berlin Institute of Design; Sauerteig studied video arts, and Smital gravitated toward typography and magazine designs. Together, they devoured magazines like i-D, Ray Gun, and The Safe, lured by their abstract layouts and experimental typography, and developed an affinity for brand design. For them, the fall of the wall ushered in a new world with new aesthetics. It also introduced them to Vermehr. Vermehr is technically German, but Germany isn’t really his home. He spent the first years of his life in Venezuela, where his father worked for a pharmaceutical company. His family eventually settled down in Guatemala, where he spent most of his adolescence, and today he lives with his wife and children in Vancouver, working with his colleagues through Google Hangouts. Unlike his colleagues, Vermehr grew up in a house filled with technology and Western culture — Apple II computers, Frank Zappa — yet growing up in Guatemala left him with a confused sense of cultural identity. He went to a German school, but the kids in his neighborhood were Guatemalan, and he had trouble finding friends who shared his deepening interests in the arts. He wasn’t stuck behind a wall, but he had the same desire to break away. ""I felt alien to Guatemala,"" he explains. ""For me, Guatemala was a bit too tight, too closed. There was not much art, and I was really longing to move away to Europe. I was thirsty for different stuff."" The country was also in the middle of decades-long political strife, with dictators, guerilla groups, and militias vying for power. The unrest never directly affected him or his family, though he has vivid memories of an abduction he witnessed as a teenager. ""There would be five guys with machine guns, always in a Toyota car with tinted windows,"" he remembered, before describing the scene he saw unfold in his neighborhood. ""And this guy that was kidnapped was working for the unions, I guess. But he was kidnapped and he looked at us as they were taking him away and said, ‘Help me, help me.’ Things like that, you pick up as a teenager and it was not… I don’t know, it was really bad."" As an adult, both his life and work have been driven by a fierce sense of restlessness, sending him zig-zagging across the globe. ""I like to move forward,"" he said. ""I’m not a guy who goes back too often. I have not gone back to Guatemala for 15 years or so."" Vermehr moved to Berlin after high school, where he took drawing classes and snuck into art-school lectures. He eventually enrolled at the Essen design school in Cologne, Germany, and, after a cross-country US trip in a Volkswagen van with his wife, returned to the capital to work at MetaDesign, a graphic design firm. It was there, in 1994, that he met Sauerteig, a student intern at the time who was still learning his way around a desktop computer. The two first met when they were assigned to work on an exhibition in Berlin and immediately hit it off, bonding over their shared interests in music and science fiction. Sauerteig also showed a keen interest in Vermehr’s vision of screen-based design, and quickly caught on to the meticulous digital block-building that pixel art demanded. They began publishing pixel designs to their website after Sauerteig graduated from art school in 1996, and eventually brought Smital into the fold. Months later, eBoy was born. Sauerteig, 46, is sitting cross-legged in a lounge chair in the new eBoy office in Wedding, next to the floor-to-ceiling windows that span the length of the space. The ground-floor, single-room studio is largely sparse, save for a small sitting area, and a desk with two hulking iMac displays. It’s an appropriately clutter-free space for a company founded on the promise of non-physical media. Kai Vermehr ""Back then the conversation among designers always was, ‘How can you print it? How can you print it?’"" Vermehr had told me in an earlier conversation. ""I think we were maybe the first among the artists we related to to say, you don’t have to print it, you can have it on your computer."" It was Vermehr — the unofficial nucleus of eBoy — who began experimenting with pixel-based art in the mid 1990s. Lean and lanky with deep-set eyes, he speaks in jolts when discussing his passions — art, music, family — hopscotching from one sentence to the next with contagious excitement. What drew him to pixels, he said, was the promise of perfection. ""I was always very interested in reproduction, the concepts of reproduction,"" Vermehr explained. ""When I first started working with digital, it fit just perfectly, because I was able to work with a medium which created things that could be reproduced at exactly the same quality I wanted… Before, you could maybe make reproductions of a painting, but they always looked terrible. And that was not the case with digital art. It was just another perfect copy of the original, and that was amazing. In a way it was a personal obsession of mine."" He wasn’t the only one drawn to the style. As more advanced technology rendered Atari and Nintendo consoles obsolete, artists began returning to pixels, creating illustrations, videos, and music from video game graphics and hardware. ""Pixel art signifies a return to a simple time, when all the elements of a picture and style were individually identifiable,"" Jesper Juul, a theorist in video game studies at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts, said in an email. It’s a visual form rooted in the same nostalgia that pervades so much of the internet’s aesthetic today — a fondness for the Reagan-era simplicity of Duck Hunt and Super Mario, an ongoing homage to the days of DIY computing and Apple IIs. Online, it’s become ubiquitous. Tumblr is full of artists, both amateur and professional, posting 8-bit GIFs and graphics, and a lot of it looks the same. But eBoy has somehow managed to set themselves apart, earning both commercial success and critical acclaim. ""Irony is the biggest factor,"" said Steven Heller, a design critic and journalist who co-chairs the design MFA program at the School of Visual Arts in New York. ""They are to 8-bit what Roy Lichtenstein was to Ben-Day dots and comics. The variations of their limited medium are very impressive."" Heller came across eBoy’s work a few years ago at a studio, where he saw a blown-up version of one of their pixoramas — a series of comically dystopian, ""Where’s Waldo""-like cityscapes that have become their trademark. Although their style is pixel-based and rife with videogame-like imagery, they say they never intended to make explicitly retro art. ""That’s a very common misconception about eBoy — that we are a retro-inspired company,"" Vermehr said. ""Maybe we use some elements so the result looks like old games, but it’s not intentional. Our roots are really more in the technology we use nowadays and started to use back then. We didn’t pick out pixel art because it looked pretty but because it was technically logical to use for the work we wanted to do, and it’s actually very enjoyable."" Sauerteig is a little more blunt about it. When I ask how he feels about being labeled as one of the ""godfathers of pixel,"" he smiles and sits up in his chair. ""I don’t really know where that came from, I think it was from an interview and it just stuck,"" he says. ""I really think most pixel art is boring. I get tired when I hear that term."" ""Everything just seems bigger,"" Vermehr says, gazing out of his studio window. It’s late March, and the autumnal dour of Wedding’s side streets has given way to the first signs of spring. Vermehr is in Germany for the first time in nearly five years, and Berlin seems vastly different from the city he knew during eBoy’s early days. ""It was a huge playground for things that you wanted to do,"" he says of the old Berlin. ""There was not so much control."" There are bohemian relics of that city, to be sure — a vibrant art scene, enormous open-air markets, never-ending basslines — but there are also more upscale apartment buildings, more corporate logos, and a little less dynamism. ""That made Berlin very special,"" he says. ""It felt almost unfinished."" Their early work was similarly untamed. ""The stuff that we posted on our website back then was not about the jobs we had to do for a living but more about the things we really liked,"" Vermehr says. Their days were spent working at a warehouse space above a biergarten, and their nights playing shoot-em-up games at Vermehr’s apartment. Vermehr eventually left MetaDesign — ""He was too crazy for them,"" Sauerteig laughs — and the three soon devoted all of their time to eBoy. Their first big break came in 1998, when they were commissioned to do an online video game for MTV’s Spring Break website. The final result was a Pac-Man-like game starring a pixelated Carson Daly — a far cry from the work they do now, but enough to get their foot in the door. Other jobs came pouring in — magazine layouts, ad campaigns, and t-shirts — and their portfolio soon expanded. They began constructing a series of ""jerk portraits,"" pixelated faces of celebrities and public figures (including the 9/11 bombers), and ventured into 3D work to create a series of toys for Kidrobot. They cataloged everything along the way, amassing an enormous yet fluid database that has become the backbone of their company. Steffen Sauerteig ""So this is our library,"" Sauerteig tells me. We’re seated in front of his iMac in the studio, and he’s walking me through the eBoy workflow. Their 15 years of work — more than 5,000 cars, characters, faces, and logos, everything they’ve ever designed — is all here in this one folder. ""In a way it’s really like we have a big playing room with shelves of toys and we build our toys ourselves,"" Vermehr says of their library, which they constantly harvest and modulate with each new project. ""We create the toys for ourselves and then we play and create things with them."" He drags a car into an empty Photoshop page, and zooms in to the pixel level. He pulls out a stylus, leans forward, and begins creating a person out of pixels. It gets very quiet. Vermehr and Sauerteig moved with their families to Vancouver four years ago, but Sauerteig returned to Berlin one year later. (""It didn’t feel like home."") The move has put nine hours of distance between Vermehr and his friends, though it guarantees that at least one person is working at any hour of the day, picking up the pixels left behind overnight, as Sauerteig is now. Watching him create a character on-screen is like an exercise in hypnosis therapy. Forms come to life with each click, each pixel adding a new wrinkle of personality. There’s clear intent behind it, but Sauerteig seems to be in a sort of fugue state throughout. ""You don’t really think about it, you just do it,"" Sauerteig says. ""It’s more meditation than work."" It’s a painstaking, methodical process, and one that stands in stark contrast to the changes swirling outside their office right now, and the upheaval that swept across their lives decades ago. There’s a fine line between meditation and tedium, and they admit that it’s sometimes difficult to toe. But for eBoy, the ordered linearity of pixel art seems to have more of a palliative effect — a bedrock of stability that keeps them grounded, without tying them down. ""That’s always the first question people ask: ‘Don’t you get bored?’"" Sauerteig says, his eyes widening. ""I never really got that. You would never ask a photographer if he gets bored taking photos. Pixels are just a tool just like a camera. The technique doesn’t really matter."" At its most basic level, eBoy is about indulgence —  indulgence in whims, curiosities, and an imagination that’s as insatiable as it is hyperactive. And although they’ve grown up and settled down over the past decade, their friends say their work remains as energetic as it ever was. ""Just look at the name,"" says Peter Stemmler, a German-born artist who goes by the name QuickHoney, and a longtime friend of the designers. ""Boys will be boys.""

Two years later and the space agency hasn't built a spaceship capable of such speeds yet — but thanks to artist Mark Rademaker, we now know what one could look like. The result is the IXS Enterprise, a ship that shares similarities with both its science fiction Star Trek namesake, and NASA's real-world space shuttle. Rademaker worked together with NASA's Dr. Harold White to produce visual concepts for the craft. White and his team at NASA are hoping to make ""faster-than-light"" travel possible with Alcubierre drives. The drives, named for physicist Miguel Alcubierre, theoretically work by distorting space-time. By expanding the space behind a ship and contracting the space in front of it, the IXS Enterprise could drastically speed up our space travel potential, making the 4.3 light-year journey to Alpha Centauri in around two weeks. Rademaker says he was influenced in the design for his Enterprise by Matt Jefferies' sci-fi artworks from the 1960s. But where famed aviation artist Jeffries, who helped create the spaceships of the Star Trek universe, imagined spindly craft with thin rings, the IXS Enterprise sits inside two circles chubby enough to power its Alcubierre drive. The spacecraft is fatter than most of Jefferies' sci-fi ships, too, capable of bearing four cylindrical pods on its flanks, and sporting a wide, flat, duck's bill of a command module. Speaking at the SpaceVision conference last year, Dr. White justified the design, saying that ""if you're going to go to all the trouble of making it that big, you might as well fit all you can in there."" Until NASA announces a breakthrough in its research of Alcubierre drives and ""faster-than-light"" travel technology, Rademaker's concepts will remain only concepts. But his visualization of the IXS Enterprise still gives us a glimpse of the kinds of vehicles we'll hopefully one day be able to use to travel to strange new worlds, to seek out new life, and new civilizations.  All images courtesy of Mark Rademaker. An Alcubierre drive is theoretically capable of warp speeds, but the travel time to our nearest neighbor is still two weeks. Any ""faster-than-light"" craft will need to be big enough to have room for staff and supplies to survive out beyond the edge of our solar system. Rademaker's images imagine the ship during its construction. His design is shown to be modular, with space for four pods on the side of the ship that could house living quarters, supplies, or — in keeping with the ship's name — a holodeck. The number of sponsors suggests NASA is expecting the commercial space travel sector to keep growing. Squint at the bottom right of the nameplate and you might see a familiar logo: Weyland-Yutani, the nefarious fictional megacorporation from the Alien movies. The body of the IXS Enterprise is suspended inside two large rings, a design decision that means the craft can sit safely inside the warp bubble generated by its Alcubierre drive. A good thing, too: any appendages that jutted outside would be subjected to unimaginable effects as the ship distorted space-time. The concept of a warp drive-enabled spaceship is still fanciful at this point in human development, but Rademaker's images blend elements of real-world tech with sci-fi suggestion.

At first he had fun breaking in and defacing web sites, something he says he now regrets, but then he learned that he can get paid for reporting the weaknesses he was exploiting. Under the handle @cyberboyIndia, he says he has earned around $30,000 in so called bug bounties, enough to pay for a good portion of his college education. These days the 19-year-old is supposed to be cramming for his final exams as he prepares for a degree in engineering. But many nights he finds himself awake too late, laptop humming away, hunting for software vulnerabilities on services run by firms like Yahoo, Paypal, and AT&T. On Twitter, Shashank catalogs the rewards he receives for reporting weaknesses, a highlight reel that ranges from a free hat, to a new smartphone, to a $1,500 check. The money is good, although it’s murder on his grades. opened laptop for 5 min. found something suspicious.Bug in Google spotted . ended up using laptop for 5 hours :/. thats why i fail in xam :|  Shashank is part of a broader trend sweeping the security industry. Last week, Google announced that it was changing the rules on its bug bounty program, Pwnium. Instead of a respectable $2.7million awarded once a year, the contest will now run year round, with a total prize pool of ""∞ million*."" In other words the money never has to stop flowing, although Google’s clever asterisk placement reserves the right to cancel at any time. Google upped its reward pool to infinity But that’s not likely to happen, at least if Google wants to stay competitive. Bug bounty programs used to work with informal rewards: a thank you letter, an online shoutout, a free t-shirt, or perhaps a few hundred dollars. But over the last five years, they have become a bonanza. Almost every major tech company has one running, and they have steadily increased the size and volume of rewards. Most importantly, a new breed of startups like Crowdcurity, Bugcrowd, Synack, and HackerOne have made it possible for any company to launch its own bug bounty, dramatically expanding the size of the market. Instead of being something only large technology companies do, bug bounties are now proliferating across all industries and for companies big and small, allowing these startups to pay out millions in rewards over the past two years. ""It’s changed the way we think about security,"" says Andrew Pile, the chief technology officer at Vimeo, which recently launched a bug bounty through HackerOne. ""It would have been nearly impossible for us to build this kind of program in-house from scratch."" ""It changed the way we think about security."" As Vimeo grew in size over the years, it would receive occasional submissions about security flaws in its system, but Pile never felt comfortable paying for them. ""The only way we could thank them was a free account or t-shirt, which didn’t really encourage the best people to come back."" Like most companies, Vimeo had a chicken and egg problem. Building up critical mass of trusted researchers required shelling out big bucks. But it was loath to open up its checkbook for people it didn’t know and trust, especially a disparate and sometimes anonymous mob of teenage hackers. Bug bounty startups essentially act as market makers, creating trust and liquidity so that smaller companies like Vimeo can tap into the supply of global hackers. ""Paying people can be a real pain; they are all over the world, and they don’t have W-9s,"" says Pile. HackerOne handles the legal and logistical nightmare, taking care of billing and payment in exchange for a 20 percent commission on top of each bounty. The system is working so well that companies, which are large enough to handle their own programs, like Yahoo and Twitter, have chosen to use third-party vendors like HackerOne instead. ""The band-aid approach of throwing more and more hardware and software at the problem clearly is not working. We need an orthogonal approach, and one that is proven,"" says Bill Gurley, a venture capitalist and investor in HackerOne. ""Bug bounty programs get in front of the problem instead of just playing defense."" For the bug hunters, the biggest risk is that they will invest hours in finding a flaw and writing a report that explains how it works and can be fixed, only to learn that it’s already been submitted by a rival. Shashank and his friends have crafted playful memes about the heartbreak of ""duplicates,"" as they are known in the business.   ""There is a huge amount of trust involved,"" says Vimeo’s Pile. ""They spend a ton of time identifying and documenting these issues, and then the report goes into a black box. I closed out a significant number that were duplicates, and unfortunately we can only pay on a first come first serve basis."" ""Bug bounty like online poker, I think.""  Interestingly, none of the half dozen researchers from bug bounty leader boards contacted by The Verge were doing this work full time. The haphazard nature made monthly earnings uneven. All referred to it as a passion, a hobby, or a part-time gig, although many said the pay was quite good when they happened to strike first. ""Bug bounty like online poker I think [sic],"" wrote a Russian hacker, Andrew. ""You may be in luck and got a big prize [but] may be not in luck and during long time nothing to find [sic]."" In a way, the robust market of researchers may be as much about outsourcing as crowdsourcing. There is a wealth of teenage talent in places like India and Pakistan willing to hunt bugs despite the risk of time wasted. Dupes or low-value reports can also be a problem for the companies entering this market. ""The downside of saying 'if you give us vulnerability we will give you money' is you get a lot of garbage reports,"" says Daniel LeCheminant, who recently launched Trello’s bounty program. ""In the first week and a half we have gotten 200 submissions and maybe 10 were actionable."" Former NSA operatives are getting into the bug business Because of this inefficiency, Synack uses a much less open model. It’s the best funded of the bug bounty startups, and it was founded by veterans of the NSA who spent years looking for vulnerabilities that could be exploited by the government. ""We are taking a different approach from these other managed bug bounty providers,"" says founder Jay Kaplan. ""The number of people out there in developing countries eager to make even $50 can create a lot of noise."" The companies that use Synack don’t pay hackers, but instead pay a flat fee for the service. Synack uses a limited pool of hackers who have passed its three-tiered test, vets all the submissions, and assigns the bounties, insulating its more conservative, largely non-tech clients from the chaos. Alex Rice, the former head of Facebook security and now CTO of HackerOne, says that most hackers will choose an official program over the black market, even if the prices are not as high. ""To sell something on the black market, you have to weaponize it. That can take months. And so you have to empower the majority. They have the software skills but not the malicious intent."" But some industry experts warn that if not handled properly, this dynamic can have repercussions for the companies running the bounty programs. ""The problem is companies think that bug bounties are simply something they can announce and that will be enough,"" Ilia Kolochenko, CEO and founder of the security firm High-Tech Bridge, said on his company blog. He used the example of a hacker who reports a duplicate that has not yet been patched. ""Okay, if you’re not interested in what we’ve discovered, we’ll swap our white hat for a grey / black hat and talk to someone else who may well pay us more."" """"When an organization has a gun to its head, it starts wasting time."" Gus Anagnos helped launch the bug bounty programs at Paypal and now works at Synack. ""What doesn’t get talked about much,"" he says, is the blowback from hackers who felt they didn’t get enough money or that their bugs weren’t disclosed in a reasonable amount of time. These hackers would often go public, creating a PR nightmare for the company involved. That leads to companies overreacting to every submission. ""When an organization has a gun to its head, it starts wasting time on vulnerabilities that aren’t very important,"" says Anagnos. The startups who run these marketplaces have ameliorated the duplicate problem in part by awarding points that build a hacker’s reputation. ""They give points for your duplicate bugs,"" Shashank told The Verge by email. Those points add up to invitations for private bounty hunts where rewards are more plentiful and competition is less crowded. ""So here we get the fruit of our duplicate bugs,"" Shashank says. He currently sits on the leaderboards for Bugcrowd and Crowdcurity, which highlight the top researchers of each month and all time. These private bug hunts have benefits for both sides. ""Large tech companies are comfortable with the chaos of inviting people to try and pick apart your system in public,"" says Casey Ellis, the CEO of Bugcrowd. ""A bank, a big box retailer, they aren’t built like that, they don’t have the same appetite for risk."" Startups that offer this service typically start companies with a private program open only to a select group of trusted hackers. Slowly, as the companies learn the ropes, that can be expanded to a more public test, or the launch of an official bounty program on the client’s own website. Some security professionals who were critical of the proliferation in bug bounties a few years ago have since changed their tune. ""I was afraid companies would start these programs and people would put up terrible bugs and demand money for them, and companies would waste time on them while real security vulnerabilities didn’t get fixed,"" says Dan Kaminsky. ""But I’m pleasantly surprised with how well they have worked in the field. There is a serious talent crunch, and programs like this help to maximize a company’s ability to tap all the expertise out there."" ""The moment you squash them, the new one surfaces."" Still, the programs have plenty of skeptics who feel bug hunting is largely housekeeping that doesn't address systemic security risks. ""There is a huge culture around finding the bugs so that we can patch them,"" says Peter Herzog, a security analyst and creator of OSSTMM. ""It has more of a basis in marketing than reality. The moment you squash them, the new one surfaces."" Herzog points out that high-profile hacks like Sony Pictures likely originated with an employee who was compromised, not a technical flaw. ""Most of the attacks that happened were done through social engineering. How are we going to start patching the people?"" asks Herzog. ""What’s the point of looking for bugs when people are the ones downloading and installing the malware."" Even the founders of these startups are quick to admit that bug bounties are no magic bullet for security woes. ""It’s not like you run a bug bounty program and now everything is secure,"" says Jacob Hansen, Crowdcurity’s co-founder and CEO. ""It’s one item in the toolbox. You need code reviews, physical security, and employee training."" But studies of the Chrome and Firefox bounty programs have found they are cheaper than hiring full-time security researchers. ""Organizations are coming to realize that the tools of the past don’t scale to the way they develop applications today,"" says Synack’s Kaplan. ""Companies are pushing out code 10 times a day. To keep up with hackers you can’t rely on automated approaches or occasional consultants. You need a big group with a diverse set of skills constantly probing your system for weakness.""",0.21341216260814555,0.7865878373918544,0.8222211435113004,2001,4.9075462268865566,914,6.3019693654266957,0,2,"Business, Tech, Report"

It's likely that shareholders are hoping for a better offer, despite the fact that the initial bid represented a 60 percent premium over the company's current value. But Jay Z apparently hasn't taken the bait. ""The motive for the bidder's passivity is shrouded in mystery,"" said Carl Rosén, CEO of Shareholders' Association, who has clearly not familiarized himself with the music mogul's Machiavellian approach to business. In a statement sent to The Next Web, Fredrik Bjørland, chairman of the Aspiro’s independent board committee, sought to minimize the issue, saying that reports of a vote against the deal were premature. Project Panther is the holding company through which Jay Z made his offer. ""As you probably know, the independent board committee has made a thorough evaluation of the bid from Project Panther, assisted by an external fairness opinion by ABG Sundal Collier and following a structured process. We still believe the offer is attractive for both the company and its shareholders, and recommend the offer based on this. We further note that Aktiespararna’s recommendation to not accept the offer is primarily based on an argument that more than 10% will reject the offer and a potentially raised bid by Project Panther. This is a bit surprising, as to my experience, we have neither a confirmation that more than 10% will reject the offer (as we are still within the acceptance period until March 11th) nor that Project Panther is willing to raise its bid or engage in direct negotiations with the minority shareholders. In my opinion, the recommendation to not accept the offer involves high risk, as it is well known that Aspiro is currently unprofitable and in need of capital within 12 months, and the current majority shareholder has indicated it is not willing to support this capital need. We thus believe accepting a 60% bid premium is a far better risk/reward recommendation.""",0.5639923496296697,0.4360076503703303,0.49601485258511374,357,5.1092436974789912,215,6.2604651162790699,0,0,Business

""Were we pleased it pushed to Title II? Probably not,"" Wells reportedly said at the conference. ""We were hoping there would be a non-regulated solution."" That flies in the face of the public comments that Netflix submitted to the FCC and its aggressive push not just to enforce net neutrality, but to expand the definition to cover peering and interconnection — something the FCC did. A Netflix spokesperson clarified that Wells was actually describing the evolution of the company's position. Back in 2010 Netflix was pushing for the use of Section 706. At the beginning of 2014 they were still hopeful the industry could find a solution without new regulations. But when those avenues appeared to close down, they began to push for the strongest FCC position, which meant backing Title II. ""Netflix supports the FCC's action last week to adopt Title II in ensuring consumers get the Internet they paid for without interference by ISPs. There has been zero change in our very well-documented position in support of strong net neutrality rules."" Netflix may be concerned that the FCC has overextended itself in its application of Title II. In the weeks leading up to the FCC vote, both Google and Free Press, generally advocates for strong net neutrality, warned that the common carrier designation that comes along with Title II could give ISPs an excuse to charge internet services like Netflix or YouTube twice. ""[T]his issue must be viewed in light of the efforts by some ISPs, particularly abroad, to claim that they provide a service to content providers for which they should be able to charge under a 'sender pays' model — while still charging their retail customers for the same traffic,"" read Google's FCC filing. ""To the extent the Commission encourages the falsehood that ISPs offer two overlapping access services instead of just one, or the fiction that edge providers are customers of terminating ISPs when they deliver content to the internet, it may encourage such attempts at double-recovery. That could do serious, long-term harm to the virtuous circle of internet innovation, thus greatly undermining the benefit of adopting net neutrality rules."" Update: Netflix published a blog post today with a longer quote that put Wells statement in context. ""So, over the last year, we've been very pleased that we've been able to rise the issues beyond that narrow piece out into the public consciousness, and I think that, that has come before. Were we pleased that it pushed to Title II, probably not, right? I mean, we were hoping that, there might be a non-regulated solution to it. But it seems like companies that are pursuing their commercial interests including us have to arrive at something like that. So we're super pleased that there is now a notion, at least a vehicle, for a complaint where if we are in the position we were in 12 to 18 months ago, where we can show you what it looks like if you're a subscriber on one ISP versus another. The notion of ""well we're paying this one"" and that these people are getting better service, even though they’re both paying their consumer price for bandwidth. So I would say we are very pleased with what's been accomplished. You know when you're successful as the ISPs are at providing a service. Essentially Internet has become a utility. If you think about people's willingness to drop their broadband, I think there's been some studies that they're willing to drop many other things including buying milk before they dropped their broadband. That's a pretty strong indicator that you've got something that has become, you know, a utility. And in our opinion it was very important to protect those notions.""

Instagram says the move comes in response to advertiser requests for ways to tell sequenced stories.

When you see a sponsored post on Instagram these days, you'll see a series of dots below it indicating it is a carousel. Swipe left to see the additional ads. (Or don't!)

""Nobody in the UK wants a centralized identity database,"" Dr Rachel O’Connell, an expert on online child safety advising the DPA, told The Guardian. ""The way around that is that Royal Mail knows who you are, your mobile operator knows who you are."" O'Connell suggests that users visiting porn sites could choose which organization would verify their ID, with their request and the organization's reply transmitted through an ""anonymizing hub"" to protect their identity. A regulator could then block sites that don't offer age checks, with the Authority for Television on Demand — the body that regulates online video streaming — expected to be given this role. Numerous legal and technical uncertainties However, despite broad, cross-party support for mandatory age checks, there are still numerous legal and technical uncertainties. The UK doesn't have the best track record when it comes to policing online content, with government-requested ISP filters introduced from 2013 criticized for blocking sex education and sexual abuse help sites. It's also not clear how the age checks would be applied to non-UK porn sites, although The Guardian reports that MindGeek — owner of numerous ""tube"" sites including Pornhub — has ""joined discussions"" with the DPA. There are also worries about censorship, with the UK's prime minister David Cameron outlining plans earlier this month to crack down on online extremism, including any individuals deemed to be a ""threat to the functioning of democracy."" The home secretary Theresa May has also made clear the government's ambition to revive the so-called Snooper's Charter, a bill that requires internet and phone companies to record metadata about users' texts, calls, emails, and browsing habits for a year.",0.772056469480678,0.22794353051932204,0.8965084440972575,376,5.4813829787234045,248,6.375,1,0,"Culture, Policy & Law, US & World, Web"

Maybe you woke up feeling a little lighter than usual, thinking you could go about having conversations willy-nilly, without worrying about any unwanted third parties listening in. Well, think again — at least if you're in New York City. A group of activists recently launched the project We Are Always Listening, a library of private conversations recorded (illegally) at bars, coffee shops, and gyms around the city. The group claims to be a collective of NSA spies working on a ""freelance, pro bono basis."" ""We're looking for terrorism, we're looking for signs of plots and schemes that could put the homeland at risk,"" one of the members told Gothamist. Is there a union for freelance spies? The project seems to be a (perhaps unsubtle) commentary on the NSA's ham-fisted approach to bulk data collection. One section of the site redirects to an ACLU page urging people to ask their representatives to let Section 215 of the Patriot Act (a clause that allows the FBI to order the secret collection of ""tangible things"") die. Although it seems likely Section 215 will dissolve when sections of the Patriot Act expire on June 1st, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) has scheduled a last-minute session for May 31st to try again to pass the Freedom Act. For now, there aren't many identifying factors attached to the recordings, although you can make out first names. The project is a more straightforward form of the eavesdropping you sometimes can't avoid in public spaces. It's a reminder that people have conversations that can be as mean and ridiculous as they are dull. This man talks about having sex like he's in a scene from Batman Returns. This group agrees that ""Kevin"" is ""trying too hard to be one of us."" One recording from a Crunch gym has a woman discussing her plans to finish reading a book and watch House of Cards.

The decision, reported by The Wall Street Journal, comes amid ongoing investigations into the tax practices of Amazon, Apple, and other multinationals in Europe. An Amazon spokesman told the Journal that the policy change went into effect on May 1st, and that the company will begin reporting revenue in the UK, Germany, Italy, and Spain. The Guardian reported on Amazon's UK tax change last week. Move could pressure others to follow suit Until now, Amazon has funneled nearly all of its European sales revenue through Luxembourg, under a low-tax agreement. European regulators opened an investigation into the tax arrangement last year, and in January announced that the deal may give Amazon an illegal advantage over its competitors. Earlier this month, Europe's antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager announced that investigators would not announce a decision by the June deadline they'd previously announced, citing a lack of data. The probe also covers tax arrangements that Apple and Starbucks have agreed to in Ireland and the Netherlands, respectively. Reporting revenue in individual countries could result in a significantly higher tax bill for Amazon, and could force other US tech companies to follow suit. It's not yet clear whether Amazon plans to report revenue in other European countries, and the company did not say whether the move was in direct response to regulatory pressure.

For most of us, The Story of Stan starts with an ending. On the Sunday, July 5th episode of HBO’s True Detective, one of Frank Semyon’s lackeys, known only as Stan, was murdered. At the time, you may have asked yourself, “Who’s Stan?” And later, when Frank and his wife Jordan went to pay their condolences to his widow and son, you may have again asked yourself, “Who’s Stan? As far as we knew he was just a guy with a can of pepper spray who was cruelly murdered for some reason or other. Some critics have suggested that the degree to which we know nothing about Stan is a sign of bad writing on the part of the show, but those people just weren’t paying close enough attention. The Story of Stan started long before the murder of Ben Caspare, and it’s a story of sacrifice, loyalty, and murder. It’s a story that begins with a scoop of ice cream.   The year was 1988, and a 17-year-old Stan Havelka is spending his summer selling scoops of freezer-burned rocky road to neighborhood kids and their exhausted mothers in the little nothing town of Picacho, Arizona. The Picacho Ice Cream Shack is a bright aquamarine hut on the sandy outskirts of the town. To the north is the village, where fewer than 500 people live and ever fewer work. To the south is the Santa Cruz River, a 184-mile valley that's bone dry for most of the year. And to the east and west is desert: vast, dry, and lonely, where one mile is indistinguishable from the next. One day, at the peak of the mid-afteroon heat, Stan was hunched under the soft serve machine, peering up into the dispenser, where a thick crust had started to clog. He barely even heard the door open, and the three slow strides across the linoleum before the man spoke. ""Three scoops of rum raisin."" Stan whipped around and found his eyes resting on a stranger’s broad chest. The man couldn’t have been more than a few years older than Stan, but he was a good foot taller. He wore all black, and there was something menacing about him; the only gentle thing was his hair, cropped close to his head but fluffy on top, like a puff pastry. His mouth looked like a hyphen; a small, straight line. Stan felt a cold stream of nerves drip from his throat to his gut. ""Sure, sure, rum raisin,"" Stan stuttered. The Ron Guidry of ice cream, they called him Stan began flitting about behind the counter, grabbing the scoop and throwing open the glass coffin of the freezer. Then, with a few seasoned flicks of his wrist — the Ron Guidry of ice cream, they called him — Stan had crafted a perfectly round rum raisin mountain in a paper cup. He presented it to the man on his palm, like a jeweler offering up a selection of engagement rings. ""$1.25,"" Stan said. The man handed him a one hundred dollar bill. Stan paused to turn it over in his fingers. He had never seen one before in his life. Flustered, Stan turned to put it in the register. ""Hey,"" the man said. Stan jolted up, midway through counting change. ""What are you doing tonight? You've got fast hands, and I could use someone like you."" ""Use me for what?"" ""Business,"" the man muttered, his small black eyes squinting as if he saw a sun glare no one else could. He held out his hand. ""Name's Frank. Frank Seymon."" Frank was late. It was almost midnight by the time he pulled up to the meeting spot, in a car so black it sunk into the inky darkness of the night sky. ""This fucking place,"" Frank said. ""At the corner of nowhere and nowhere."" As Stan sank into the passenger's seat, Frank barely acknowledged him, looking out the window, probably thinking about something important. They drove to a casino about 30 miles outside Picacho, because, as Frank told Stan while the car raced under the watchful light of the desert moon, he understood casinos like he'd never understood people. Frank nodded to the bartender as they entered, and as if he had telepathically commanded it, they were presented with two tumblers of brown alcohol, no rocks. At the end of the bar was a young woman, sitting alone, like Stan, definitely not old enough to be at a bar. She had short brown hair and a worried look on her face, like maybe one day in the future her husband would be murdered. She reminded Stan of the only girl he had ever dated, as all women did. ""Hi,"" Stan said, with a nod. She smiled nervously and looked away. Frank told Stan he owned this casino, and he plans to own many more. There was talk of money, blueprints, and people in positions of power whose last names Stan couldn't pronounce. The brown liquor made Stan's tongue feel thick, so he nodded instead of speaking, and Frank confused his silence for strength. Stan understood, at least, that his role would be to stand quietly but severely behind Frank, at every moment and in every crooked cop's flashback. Then, Frank handed Stan something; a small, black canister. It was pepper spray, but Stan had no idea what he was supposed to use it for. He had never had a reason to use pepper spray in Picacho. But as he rolled the small can in his palms, Stan felt a chill of destiny roll up his spine: this will be my weapon. And it was. The first time Stan sprayed the ashen mist into the eyes of an opponent, he felt powerful, almost immortal. Often he would shoot the spray straight up towards the sky, just to taste it as it fell on his lips and prickled his skin. This earned him the nickname Spicy Stan — but that's a different story. After another round of drinks, Frank asked the bartender his name: Blake. Frank and Stan clinked glasses, in a toast to their future, not noticing that Blake was keeping one ear on their conversation as he dutifully wiped down the bar. A slow, sad female folk singer came on over the speakers, uniting everyone in the bar in the cold chill of stale A/C and preordained tragedy, as if everyone could already see the moment years from now when Blake presses the cold mouth of his gun up against Stan's skull, and Stan can think of nothing but ice cream.

Beyond the mythical battles and skirmishes inside the game, the tournament was also an important event in the ongoing contest between YouTube and Twitch. The International 5 (TI5) was streamed live on both services as well as inside the Dota 2 game client itself — though this year, unlike any of the previous ones, I watched almost all of it on YouTube. What’s changed? Having lost out to Amazon in the pursuit to acquire Twitch last year, Google remained determined to own a dominant live-streaming platform and redoubled its efforts at making YouTube that destination. YouTube had already served up a good number of live music concerts and political debates, but the fight against Twitch was about recruiting gamers: both fans of titles like Dota 2 and the players who streamed their matches online. This is a big and growing business, and it’s a natural extension of YouTube’s dominant position as the main repository of user-generated videos. But YouTube’s first bite at the International cherry wasn’t a happy one: in 2014, it shared the spotlight with Twitch on Valve’s Dota 2 pages, however its streams were unreliable, lapsing into regular buffering pauses, and lacked the polish and quality of Twitch’s output. Google is streaming matches at a crisp 1080p and 60fps In 2015, YouTube’s live streams of The International have been pretty much flawless. 1080p resolution, 60 frames per second, always there when you need them. The gap in quality that existed has now been bridged, and YouTube stands as Twitch’s equal in pure technical terms. But you can’t beat Twitch by just being as good, and the thing that drew me to YouTube this year was the extra functionality on offer from Google’s video service. On YouTube, I can rewind a live stream to watch anything I might have missed over the previous two hours. This made it possible for me to start watching The International 90 minutes late and still get the full experience of the show. In fact, I would often join the stream late just so I could have a buffer of time, which I would later use to skip past the breaks between matches. YouTube isn’t the only streaming service to feature this sort of built-in DVR, but it is the only one to offer it for TI5. If Twitch is regular TV, YouTube is TV with a basic TiVo box attached to it What I’m getting from YouTube is a sort of hybrid between its own strength of on-demand video and Twitch’s live streaming. If Twitch is regular TV, YouTube is TV with a basic TiVo box attached to it. It helps me make the most of my time by letting me manipulate the time of the stuff I am watching. Especially in the earlier stages of The International, where multiple matches would be going on at the same time, YouTube was a brilliant help in letting me jump between contests without missing out on anything. And the fear of missing out is a big enough problem on the web to have become a recognized acronym: FOMO. I said above that YouTube and Twitch are now technically equivalent, but the two services are still much more different than they are similar. Twitch has a mass of active and engaged users that YouTube can’t yet rival. That sounds weird to say, given YouTube’s scale, but most people are still unaware of Google’s live-streaming ambitions and do not think of YouTube when they consider where to watch the latest e-sport tournament. At one point during the TI5 Grand Finals, I looked at YouTube’s viewer counter and it was at just over 36,000. Compare that to last year’s peak of more than two million concurrent TI4 viewers, and you get a good idea of how far YouTube has to go. We're better off with Google competing against, rather than owning, Twitch Google faces an uphill struggle in its quest to convince gamers that YouTube is the place to fulfill all their needs. Many of the most prominent game streamers might be reluctant to leave Twitch, and there’s perpetual discontent about YouTube’s monetization model, which forces creators to channel their advertising through YouTube. But then Google also enjoys an advantage, which is that when the live action ends on Twitch, its likeliest archival destination is YouTube. As a fan, I much prefer having just one place where I can watch TI5 live, rewind it if I need to, and then go back to it later with the video replays available on demand. It’s neater. Twitch isn’t going to shed its crown as the preeminent live streaming platform for gamers anytime soon. Nonetheless, YouTube’s competition is now real and substantive. The more big-time events like The International that Google can get under its belt, the more exposure YouTube’s streaming service will receive. And it won’t be long before its convenience shines through — so either Twitch will have to evolve to match YouTube’s utility or more of us will make the switch to Google’s alternative. Either way, game streaming is likely to get better as a result of this competitive tussle. I used to think that Google buying Twitch would be a really great move, but keeping them apart is turning out to be an even better idea.

At the outset of the game you have no information; you don’t know who you are or where you are, and you certainly don’t know why you’re there. You’re on a quiet street, in what you’ll soon discover is a small, charmingly quaint English village in the mid-1980s. There isn’t much to guide you other than curiosity. But as you start exploring, poking around the town pub and the homes with unlocked doors, it becomes clear that everyone in the town has vanished. There are still signs of life — an ashtray that’s still smoking, an abandoned car with its turn signal on — and you’ll regularly come across audio recordings and ghostly flashback sequences, where you can get a glimpse into the lives of the people who have disappeared. You never actually see them, but you can’t escape them, and it took about five minutes before I realized I absolutely had to know what happened. Playing the game is incredibly basic. You use the left stick to move, the right to control the camera, and the X button lets you interact with a small number of objects; you can open a few doors and listen to phone messages, but for the most part you are just an observer. And that’s all there is to it. If you’ve played games like Gone Home or Dear Esther (which, like Rapture, was developed by English studio The Chinese Room), you’ll know what to expect. These games are often disparagingly referred to as ""walking simulators,"" but it’s a designation that misses the point; it’s not the walking that’s fun, it’s finding yourself in the middle of a mystery, watching it unfold all around you. What makes Rapture work is just how powerful that mystery is. I found myself completely absorbed by the story; I kept a pen nearby to keep track of people’s names and their relationships, and as I explored I not only learned about where all these people went (at least, I’m pretty sure I’ve figured it out) but I also got an incredibly intimate look into their lives. There are marriages in trouble, and problems with the church. These minor quibbles sometimes felt just as important as the big question at the heart of the game. Rapture provides very little guidance to push you along, yet I can only remember one instance where I found myself lost for more than a few minutes. There are ghostly wisps that will show you points of interest if you're paying attention, and you’ll regularly hear noises — beeping phones, alarms — that make you want to investigate a location. Instead of telling you what to do or where to go, Rapture guides you with light and sound. And, for me at least, it worked perfectly. Rapture can feel limited at times. You’ll come across a frustratingly large number of locked doors, and unlike in many similar games, where you can pick up objects and examine them, the world of Rapture feels bolted down in comparison. There were many times when I wanted to be nosy, but the game wouldn’t let me. But after an hour or so this bothered me less and less. Instead of an investigation, which I initially expected, Rapture feels more like one of those guided museum tours, only you’re learning about an apocalyptic event instead of ancient history. It’s a radio drama crossed with a video game. It also doesn’t hurt that the world you’ll be exploring is absolutely wonderful. Rapture nails that cozy English village vibe perfectly; every moment feels like a postcard, and I couldn’t help but take a lot of screenshots. The main reason why I’m disappointed that I can’t interact with the world more is that everything looks so real that it feels like I should interact with it. The homes feel warm and lived in, and nothing ever really feels like it was designed as part of a video game (with the exception of the city maps you’ll find in just about every building). In fact, often when you see something that doesn’t make sense at first — a huge splash of blood, say, or a turned over can of white paint — you’ll find you understand it later when you see the associated flashback. The music, meanwhile, seamlessly jumps from soothing to heart-thumping to suit the what’s happening in the story, and even the ambient noise — chirping birds, buzzing insects — helps pull you further into the world. Video game apocalypses tend to alternate between the gritty realism of Fallout and the Red Bull-fueled action of Sunset Overdrive, but Rapture is something completely different. It may be the end of the world, but that doesn’t mean it can’t be beautiful and relaxing. Rapture and its ilk aren’t for everybody. There are plenty of people who will find themselves bored by simply walking around a quiet, empty village waiting to hear what happened next. But if you’re like me, you’ll find yourself hooked. Some of my favorite video game moments are when nothing is really happening at all — when I can sit on a swing and listen to music in Life is Strange, or when I’m walking down a deserted highway, watching a Las Vegas sunrise in Fallout. They’re not just peaceful moments, but ones that are unique to games; they make you feel like you’re in a real place, one where even small moments can have real meaning. Rapture is a game that’s made entirely of those moments, and it’s amazing.

Their single finder was released alongside another new feature, ""Setlist Creator,"" which allows fans attending a specific show to pick three songs they want to hear at said show. The resulting selections are going to influence the band's setlists throughout their upcoming world tour. At a time when every music streaming service under the sun is trying to set themselves apart through curated listening experiences, this is a neat example of what I'm calling ""microcuration"": a personalized experience taking place within a single band's discography. In this case, the curation is lent a bit of additional credibility by the fact that the band directed the song selection process, rather than relying on an outside expert or an entirely algorithmic system. If anyone's qualified to parse the differences between songs in the band's discography, it's probably the people who wrote and performed them. (This is especially true in the case of Beach House, a band renowned for their thorough exploration of a narrow musical lane and subtle shifts between records.) ""For us, it’s always a strange moment when a single has to be chosen,"" said the band on their Facebook page. ""No one song ever feels like a perfect representative for a record. This device allows you all to choose the three songs you have enjoyed most in the past and have a 'single' chosen for you based loosely on what we consider to be musical similarities.""  The single finder and setlist creator could also be used to conduct a bit of market research, if the band were so inclined — both tools are going to yield plenty of information about fans' musical preferences and locations.

The heroine of Tacoma, a creepy space exploration game under development by Fullbright, has arrived on a commercial lunar station only to find that the crew has gone missing. Whatever happened to them appears to have been sudden and terrifying. It's up to you, as Ferrier, to explore the station and find the answers. I played through the first half-hour or so of Tacoma, which was developed by the studio behind beloved 2013 indie game Gone Home. Like that cult hit, Tacoma involved exploring a large, empty space, picking up objects and listening to audio files found along the way. Gone Home was a domestic mystery about family and the shifting relationships between parents, children, and siblings. Tacoma moves its mystery to space, but the drama is no less human. Piecing together the past through augmented reality Tacoma's sci-fi setting allows it to introduce some new mechanics, starting with its ""augmented reality"" logs. Playing one of the logs launches a simulation in which brightly colored figures appear and have a conversation, each figure representing a member of the missing crew. You watch them interact, listen to their conversations, and occasionally even follow the characters to different locations. The AR logs create several new gameplay possibilities for Fullbright, not all of which have yet been built inside the game. In an interview, Steve Gaynor, co-founder of Fullbright, said that later in the game, you might miss part of a conversation when a figure travels behind a locked door. It would be up to you to find another way into the room and replay the conversation to see what you missed. It's an idea that may or may not make it into the finished game, he said, but it shows the range of possibilities Fullbright is trying to explore. As Tacoma begins, an AR log instructs you to go to the crew quarters to find your teammates. Once you do, though, you find the door is locked. Opening it requires rebooting ODIN (not to be confused with SHODAN), a HAL-like virtual intelligence that answers some of your questions while deflecting others. (Some of the information you request is ""classified,"" according to ODIN.) As you work to open the doors, you'll encounter AR logs showing the crew before it disappeared. In one, they gather in the ship's lounge to watch some sort of galactic event out of the windows. In another, the man Amy was sent to replace receives medical news that threatens to ruin his career. And in the demo's final scene, you see your missing crewmates react to an unknown emergency and make their way behind a mysterious door. The answers may lie above your head The other new gameplay mechanic in Tacoma is ""surface transfer,"" which enables you to temporarily detach from the magnetized surfaces on the station and use gravity to reach new terrain. You may reach a dead end and look up to see a long tunnel; tap a button and you're hurtling upside-down to another level of the ship, whereupon your boots reattach to the ground with a satisfying crunch. Transferring makes Tacoma a more vertical game than its predecessor, and causes you to constantly evaluate your surroundings to see whether the answer to current problem may be above your head. Everything here feels relatively low-key: there's no combat in Tacoma, and the pace is unhurried despite the mounting sense of dread. Earlier this year I played Adrift, another upcoming first-person game set on an empty space station. Adrift runs on adrenaline: you must constantly find new sources of oxygen just to stay alive, and the lack of gravity leaves you spinning and disoriented from the start. Tacoma is more relaxed, at least in its first section: you're eager to learn what happened to your would-be crewmates, but you can take your time exploring without suffering any negative consequences. The biggest question can't be answered yet For fans of Gone Home, the biggest question about Tacoma will likely be whether a near-future sci-fi adventure can pack the same emotional wallop as the near-past domestic drama that preceded it. For now, that question is unanswerable. From the way it begins, though, Tacoma looks to be a compelling mystery in its own right. Tacoma is coming in 2016 for PC and Xbox One.",0.4822664478662716,0.5177335521337284,0.84575119228545,744,4.881720430107527,413,6.0871670702179177,0,2,"Culture, Entertainment, Gaming, Hands-on, Report"

Motorola’s been chasing that ideal since 2013 with its Moto X phones, which have always had an attractive ergonomic design, an unencumbered Android experience, and pricing well below flagship smartphones from Apple and Samsung. But at the same time, the Moto X has also represented what many consider to be the worst of Android: lousy cameras and mediocre battery life. Now Motorola is launching its third edition of the Moto X, which you can preorder starting today. The Moto X Pure Edition (or Moto X Style if you’re not in the US) is a lot like its predecessors. It’s also aggressively priced, perhaps more so than ever before, starting at just $399 completely unlocked. That last bit is important as the new Moto X isn’t being sold through carriers (in the US, at least) at all — you can only purchase it direct from Motorola or from its retail partners (Best Buy and Amazon). But it’s compatible with all four major US carriers, which is still a rarity among unlocked phones. Beyond working with virtually any SIM card you might have, Motorola says this year’s phone includes a class-leading camera, addressing the biggest complaint with its prior devices. Based on Motorola’s promises, you’d think that it’s finally cracked how to build the perfect Android smartphone. I’ve been using it for the past week, and, well, it’s far from perfect. It’s not the best smartphone you can buy, Android or otherwise. But it is a really good smartphone at a really great price, and to do better than the new Moto X, you’re going to have dig much deeper into your wallet. In fact, the new Moto X looks so similar to last year’s version that you might be hard-pressed to tell them apart at first glance. It has the same dual front-facing speakers, same metal trim, and same customizable back, where you can choose from various woods, leathers, or plastic finishes using Moto Maker. (Our review unit has a handsome walnut finish.) There are two distinct differences: the camera surround on the back has been redesigned (though it feels like it was changed just for the sake of changing something, and not for any particular purpose), and the phone is much bigger this time, housing a significantly larger 5.7-inch display. That display pushes the Moto X from a small- to medium-sized device into Big Phone territory, and make no mistake, this a Big Phone. But like the Galaxy Note 5, the Moto X doesn’t feel as big as it looks, and it’s not completely unwieldy to use. (The Nexus 6 has only a slightly larger display, but feels significantly bigger than the Moto X, for example.) It also fits in my pocket, and I didn’t drop it a single time in the week I’ve been using it. We all want phones with big screens, but at the same time want them to be manageable to use. This year, Motorola and Samsung (and to a certain extent, LG) have seemed to figure out the formula to make that work. The similarities to Samsung’s flagship phone largely end there, however. The Moto X is a well-built device with a smart and efficient design, but it’s not nearly as premium feeling as Samsung’s device. The phone has all the pieces of a flagship phone: metal rim, Gorilla Glass front, and nice styling. But there’s a subtle sense that the pieces don’t all mesh into a singular whole like they could. For example, the curves from the front to the metal sides are plastic. None of this makes it look cheap, but it doesn’t take long to figure out which is the more expensive device when you compare it to a Galaxy Note 5. Motorola’s new, 5.7-inch quad HD LCD display also isn’t nearly as nice as Samsung’s panels. It’s not a bad screen by any means. Motorola went with an LCD display this time around, and it’s sharp, colorful, usable outdoors, and has good viewing angles. But it’s not eye-popping or class leading by any stretch. It’s a functional display that does its job, but it doesn’t encourage you to stare at it and appreciate its beauty. Perhaps the biggest (and most anticipated) upgrade from last year to this is the Moto X’s new 21-megapixel camera. It’s a significant leap in both resolution and capability over the 13-megapixel model from last year, and it does a much better job at taking photos. But last year’s model set a really low bar, and while the new camera is much better, it’s still outclassed by Apple, LG, and Samsung’s cameras. Images taken in good lighting conditions are bright and colorful, though there’s a tendency for them to look over-sharpened. It makes the images look unnaturally digital and not as attractive as those captured by the Note 5, iPhone 6 Plus, or G4. In poor lighting, the Moto X does a much better job than before, but it still misses focus often and pictures come out much softer than I’d expect. I also wish it had optical image stabilization, which has basically become a must for any premier smartphone. If this sounds like I’m being overly critical of the camera, that’s because I am. The camera is one of the most important features on any smartphone, and it’s something that many people use every single day. It’s one of the few things that can make or ruin a smartphone experience, as my colleague Vlad Savov has pointed out time and again. The Moto X’s camera isn’t bad by any means, it’s just not as good as other options. On the plus side, the Moto X’s camera is better than virtually any other option in its price range, including the OnePlus 2 or ZTE Axon Pro. Its app is also quick, and the twist gesture to launch the camera is faster and more reliable than before. (It’s still not as quick as Samsung’s double tap on the home button, however.) But if you’re looking for the absolute best smartphone camera, the Moto X doesn’t have it. The front-facing camera on the Moto X is a 5-megapixel unit with a wide angle lens, which is great for selfies. Motorola decided to put an LED flash on the front this year, but I don’t recommend using it. It put spots in my eyes and produced unnatural lighting. It’s no shocker that a bright light shined two feet away from your face is exactly as terrible as it sounds. The Moto X is equipped with Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 808 and 3GB of RAM, which is a good combination for solid, reliable performance. The X didn’t exhibit significant stuttering or lag while I used it, and it handled games without issue. It also didn’t get uncomfortably warm, even when multitasking or playing games. The 808 is not a top of the line processor, however, and the X never felt as snappy quick or lightning fast as other Android phones that have come out this year. Battery life has been a concern with the Moto X in the past, and fortunately, the new model doesn’t have trouble lasting an entire day for me. Given the size of the X and its 3,000mAh battery, I would have loved to have gotten two days out of it, but it’s still an improvement and par for the course at this point. The Moto X lacks the wireless charging features that the Note 5 or Nexus 6 have, but it does come with a quick charger that can rapidly top up the battery when you need it to. In my tests, the battery went from completely exhausted to 100 percent charged in just about an hour, which is quite impressive. Motorola’s approach to software is largely unchanged, and that’s a good thing. The X runs Android 5.1 Lollipop that’s about as close to stock as you can get outside of the Nexus range. There are no annoying interface changes or duplicated apps, and since the Moto X comes completely unlocked, there are no carrier apps or bloatware to worry about. The few things that are included are useful: I really like the Moto Display feature that wakes the screen up with new notifications or when I pull the phone out of my pocket, and the Assist feature is great when I want my phone automatically silenced during a meeting. Motorola talks a lot about the always-available voice control on the X line, but I’ve found I don’t use that particular feature all that often, and most Android phones have something like that now anyway. The Moto X Pure Edition sits at the top of Motorola’s lineup, but it’s actually a really good mid-range phone with an attractive, but appropriate, mid-range price. It doesn’t really match or compete with higher-priced flagship devices like the iPhone 6 Plus or Galaxy Note 5. It also lacks things like a fingerprint scanner or wireless charging, which are becoming more commonplace on high-end smartphones this year. But to do better than the Moto X, you have to spend a lot more money, and it’s not clear to me that the investment is worth it for most people. The Moto X has a better design, better performance, and better camera than any other smartphone available for under $500. Unless you’re prepared to spend hundreds of dollars more, you’re not going to find something better. Its few faults aren’t really things that ruin its experience, and the Moto X proves that you don’t need to be class-leading in order to make a really great phone. As it turns out, in 2015, a really good mid-range smartphone is also a really good overall smartphone, and the Moto X Pure Edition is the best mid-range smartphone you can get.",0.5068865258874644,0.4931134741125356,0.16670647360302537,1650,4.6957575757575754,689,6.0449927431059507,0,14,"Google, Mobile, Tech, Review"

Alongside all of its other announcements today, Lenovo is showing off a pile of random, weird smartphones. None of them will be coming to North America, but if you're wondering what Motorola's parent company has planned for China, the Middle East, and Europe, prepare to take in the strangeness. The craziest of all are the two Phab phones. I've made my peace with the Phablet term — it was annoying until it wasn't, and now that all phones are basically huge, it sort of doesn't really apply to anything anymore. But Lenovo is embracing it and, well, extending it. The base model Phab has a 6.98-inch, 1080p screen and decidedly middle-of-the-road internal specs. The upgraded Phab Plus has a slightly smaller 6.8-inch screen with the same resolution and slightly better internals, including 2GB of RAM and a Qualcomm 615 processor. Neither is powerful, both stretch the definition of phone past the breaking point and into tablet territory. Lenovo's PR says that these devices ""eliminate the dilemma of choosing between costly smartphones with big screens and underwhelming small tablets by offering a sweet-spot 6.8-inch device."" I say it's a small tablet you can make calls with. Potato, Potahto, Phab. If that's not weird enough for you, gaze upon the Vibe S1, which has two front-facing cameras for selfies. The main sensor is 8 megapixels while the second is just a 2mp depth-sensing camera so you can add bokeh effects to your selfies. There's also some surprisingly decent specs to commend the Vibe S1 to you: it has a MediaTek processor, sure, but there's 3GB of RAM and 160GB of storage. Lenovo also has a Vibe P1 and P1m, both of which have another gimmick: a physical switch that puts the phone into power-saving mode. Oh, and one more: absolutely gigantic batteries. The P1m is the lower-end of the two with a 5.5-inch 720p screen and a 4,000mAh (!) battery. The P1 has a nicer 1080p, 5-inch screen and a 5,000mAh (!!!) battery. Just. Massive.

Acer's unleashing a whole new line of Predators, and Lenovo is taking on the challenge with a new range of gaming PCs of its own. But as aggressive and hungry for hype as both have been, neither is going quite as far as Asus, which today introduced the world's first water-cooled laptop. Water cooling has traditionally been an exotic extra that gamers would append to their rigs to enhance their cooling setups, on the one hand, and to accredit themselves as hardcore enthusiasts, on the other. It's grown increasingly easier to incorporate into modern PCs as the size of other components has shrunken and companies have started developing self-contained water-cooling kits that take a lot of the pain (and spills) out of the installation. Even so, water cooling in a laptop is about as far-fetched as modern gaming gear gets. Forget MSI and its blinged-out WASD keys, the new benchmark for laptop gaming bragging rights is having your own radiator and pump combo.   The Asus GX700 is still mostly a mystery at this point. Asus isn't divulging many of this machine's specs, other than to say that it will be the first 17-inch laptop with a 4K display. We know there'll be an Nvidia GeForce graphics card inside it, and we can assume it will be ready to overclock once the water cooling rig is joined up with the GX700 to amp up performance. The premise of this laptop is that it's a mighty pixel-pushing machine in its own right, but once it's docked, everything can be turned up that extra bit further into the ludicrous sphere. I struggle to understand how a big and heavy cooling setup is an improvement on something like Alienware's external-GPU system that lets you power gaming on a laptop with a desktop graphics card (and replace that card when needed). That's about as portable a setup as this, but leaves more flexibility for the user. Then again, we still don't know the price and full details of the GX700.

As we reported earlier this week in our feature on the global war on rats, New York is now aggressively targeting hotspots where rats live in huge numbers. This map, pointed out by commenter bcswartzfager and designed by Meredith Myers, shows where some of those hotspots are. It draws on 311 data, displaying the last 10,000 rat sightings that have been called in to the social services hotline. As you can see, some areas are bright red, with hundreds more reports than nearby neighborhoods.  The Rat Reservoir program, as New York’s new initiative is called, identifies these hotspots, then tracks rats back to their burrows in parks, road medians, and sewers. Often, neighborhoods with chronic rat problems have what’s called a ""reservoir,"" a place where rats can breed in huge numbers, causing problems in the surrounding area no matter what residents or exterminators do. When these reservoirs are found, the inspectors will seal up burrows, poison intensively, and work with the neighborhood to design better waste management plans, cutting off the rat’s food supply. Rats breed so incredibly fast that if the food supply and nesting space isn’t removed, the population will bounce back within months. During the pilot program, the city found an 80 to 90 percent drop in rat sightings in areas near targeted reservoirs. New York is now aggressively targeting rat hotspots When I recently spoke with New York Deputy Commissioner for Environmental Health Dan Kass, he cautioned that the city can’t rely on rat reports alone when tracking down hotspots. Some neighborhoods just feel more comfortable complaining to the city that others, he said, so that 311 data needs to be coupled with proactive inspection. The 311 data is updated daily, so Meyers’s map is extremely current, usually with a couple day’s lag.

""Although it’s fascinating scientifically to have a front-row seat to watch the ice shelf becoming unstable and breaking up, it’s bad news for our planet,"" Khazendar said in a statement. ""This ice shelf has existed for at least 10,000 years, and soon it will be gone."" Ice shelves prevent glaciers from floating from Antarctica toward the ocean and contributing to a rise in sea level. Scientists have long acknowledged the effect of climate change on the world's ice sheets, but several recent studies suggest things are worse than initially thought. A 2013 study debunked the idea that isolated ice sheets in East Antarctica were immune to the effects of global warming. A study published last month found the rate at which Antarctica's ice sheets are melting has accelerated greatly over the last two decades. Khazendar says the Larsen B timeline is based on a widening rift near the ice shelf's grounding line, which will eventually crack all the way across.  Scientists believe the Larsen B Ice Shelf has existed since the end of the last major glaciation 12,000 years ago, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC). It was about 220 meters (720 feet) thick. The shelf, a floating ice mass on the eastern side of the Antarctic Peninsula, partially collapsed in 2002 when a large chunk on its northern side broke off and shattered. During that collapse, a total of about 3,250 square kilometers of shelf area melted within 35 days, according to the NSIDC. The shelf has three main tributary glaciers (two of which are apparently named after Moby Dick characters), which researchers originally assumed to be stable. Now the JPL has found that two of those glaciers have thinned by 65 to 72 feet since 2002, and their flow speed has accelerated as much as eightfold, according to NASA. ""What is really surprising about Larsen B is how quickly the changes are taking place,"" Khazendar said.

A startup out of Spain is working on that very idea. The company's called Vortex Bladeless, and its turbines look like stalks of asparagus poking out of the ground. Instead of using the wind to rotate a blade, the company's pillars shake back and forth from the vortices created by the movement of air around the structure. Engineers look to avoid these forces when designing buildings and other structures, but the Vortex turbine takes advantage of this phenomenon to oscillate in the wind. Typically, a structure can only be optimized to oscillate at the specific frequencies caused by a certain wind speed, but Vortex says it is using magnets to adjust the turbine on the fly to get the most from whatever the wind speeds happen to be. Once the structure starts vibrating, an alternator in the base of the device then converts the mechanical movement into electricity.  But why bother switching from traditional wind turbines in the first place? Well, Vortex claims that energy produced by its turbines will cost around 40 percent less than energy made from wind turbines that are operating today. A large part of that cost reduction comes from maintenance — since the Vortex doesn't have moving parts or gears, it should last longer and it won't require periodic lubrication. The simpler design also means that manufacturing costs are about half that of a traditional wind turbine (those massive blades are expensive). That said, Vortex tells Wired that its bladeless design captures around 30 percent less energy than a regular turbine. The company does note, however, that it's possible to fit more of the Vortex models in the same area. And, as a bonus, the bladeless turbines are silent. Vortex is working on a few different sizes; its ""Mini,"" a 41-foot model, should be ready for commercialization next year, while a larger, industrial model is in the works for 2018.

If a faster, better, stronger strain of bacteria escaped the lab, how would we stop it? Now, scientists have come up with a new solution: self-destructing DNA. Published today in Nature Communications, the system would use cutting-edge gene-editing tools to erase DNA as soon as a given organism leaves its designated area, destroying both the cell and its genetic information. The result is a so-called ""kill switch,"" eradicating any experimental or proprietary organisms before they can escape into the wild. ""When the system is turned on it will erase that [modified] DNA."" As GMOs become more ambitious and widespread, researchers have grown increasingly interested in containment techniques. In February, a group of Harvard scientists published a kill-switch system that used amino acids toward the same end. Under that system, synthetic organisms would die without regular access to a specific amino acid, found only in the containment area. As a result, no cells would be able to survive long in the wild, cutting down the risk of an accidental release, as well as the inherent danger of creating and experimenting with new self-replicating organisms. The system published today goes even further, targeting the DNA itself. Not only will the cells die, but the genetic information used to create them will be obliterated without a trace. That's particularly useful for commercial GMOs, since companies treat their GMOs’ genes as trade secrets. The system is even precise enough to target specific portions of DNA, so a company could delete only the modified genes, leaving the others untouched. ""You can imagine, if you have an organism that has a bunch of modified organisms that are proprietary,"" says Christopher Voigt, an MIT bioengineer who worked on the study. ""You just plug in all the systems you want erased, and when the system is turned on it will erase that DNA and largely leave the other DNA in place."" 99 percent of the cells were dead within 15 minutes The new system achieves that precision through CRISPR, a gene-editing system that's seen as one of the most exciting current developments in biotech. CRISPR is a collection of naturally occurring molecules that, when deployed right, can be used to cut out and replace sections of a cell's DNA. Researchers have already used the system to modify living genes and even edit the DNA of human embryos, generating significant controversy in bioethics circles. The kill-switch system focuses on the DNA-removal part of CRISPR, deleting genes entirely rather than replacing them. Researchers tested out the system in a limited model, using E. coli bacteria and pre-established trigger mechanisms. If the test model came in contact with a specific sugar molecule called arabinose, it would trigger the CRISPR system to delete a specified portion of the E. coli DNA, resulting in the death of the cell. It took roughly two hours for the triggers to kick in after the arabinose was added, but after that, 99 percent of the cells were dead within 15 minutes. The current version is only a proof of concept, and researchers expect more challenges as the system grows more complex. The arabinose trigger was chosen because it works well in the lab, but a field-ready version of the system would likely have a much more complex trigger that could have more trouble producing reliable results.

There’s really no way around it — at least for now. Sagging skin, weakened immune systems, and slow-healing bone fractures are pretty much inevitable above a certain age. But what if humans could reverse that process somehow? As it turns out, that might become possible — at least when dealing with bone fractures. Researchers were able to ""rejuvenate"" bone-healing cells By sharing the blood of young mice with older mice, researchers were able to ""rejuvenate"" bone-healing cells, and trigger healing speeds that rivaled those of younger mice. The research is still in its infancy, but it’s possible that it could one day lead to a drug that could help older individuals conserve the ability to quickly recover from a fracture. About one out of five people who sustain a hip fracture dies within a year of their initial injury, according to the CDC. And the rate of hip fractures increases tremendously with age; people over the age of 85 are 10 to 15 times more likely to suffer hip fractures than those between the ages of 60 and 65. That’s why understanding the mechanisms that underly bone healing is so important; for some older people, the answer could be live-saving. In the study, researchers injected the blood of young mice into older mice with broken legs. They found that the old mice that had received the ""young blood"" experienced faster fracture healing times than those that hadn’t — and those times matched those of younger mice. One out of five people who sustain a hip fracture dies within a year To narrow down the source of this change, the researchers performed bone marrow transplants in which they gave ""young blood cells"" to older mice. Once again, they found that the transplants helped the older mice heal more quickly than those who hadn't received the young blood cells. The researchers then checked to see if a protein called beta-catenin, which had been linked to repairing fractures in previous studies, was responsible. Mice produce more of this protein as they age, which might explain the difference. To verify this link, the researchers used mice with lower levels of beta-catenin; they found that these mice were able to heal quickly, even when they were elderly. In contrast, mice that were genetically modified so that they couldn't lower their beta-catenin levels didn't get a boost from young blood. The two results taken together suggest that beta-catenin is directly involved in the old mice's response to young blood. ""Bone-healing cells don't lose their ability to heal fractures."" ""Our most important finding is that as they age, bone-healing cells don't lose their ability to heal fractures the same as when they were younger,"" says Benjamin Alman, a stem cell biologist at the University of Toronto and a co-author of a new study published today in Nature Communications. Indeed, they can be stimulated to do just that. It might therefore be possible to ""develop a drug treatment that can ‘rejuvenate’ fracture healing,"" he says — before adding that humans have already produced drugs that act on beta-catenin. You probably shouldn’t get too excited about the potential for a ""fast-acting bone-healing"" drug, however. ""It is likely that many factors"" — instead of a single one — ""are involved in the multi-faceted responses of aging animals,"" says Christopher Evans, a cell biologist at the Mayo Clinic who didn’t participate in this study. In addition, the results ""suggest that the level and timing of beta-catenin signaling need to be very carefully modulated to enhance bone healing,"" Evans says. Doing that with drugs ""could be tricky."" Doing that with drugs ""could be tricky."" And any mouse study needs to be examined carefully; what works in mice doesn't always work in humans. That said, Alman thinks that this particular finding could eventually hold some benefits for our species. ""Mice heal fractures the same as people, and previous data from fracture repair in mice has carried over quite well to patents, so I suspect the same is the case in our work,"" he says. Overall, we still have a lot to learn, Evans says — ""but it is very exciting."" Alman and his team now hope to clearly identify the elements — the specific blood cell and the accompanying proteins — that are responsible for the bone-healing rejuvenation process in mice. ""We already have some promising leads,"" he says. The researchers also want to test drugs that can alter beta-catenin levels in animals soon. The study fits well with the emerging idea that the blood of younger animals can rejuvenate the tissues of old ones, Evans says. Indeed, the idea that the blood of younger individuals contains the ingredients for faster tissue repair isn’t new, but applying this technique to bone repair will certainly help extend this idea's reach. ""This work shows the importance of blood cells in fracture repair,"" Alman says. ""If we could reverse this, we would prevent complications of fractures in older patients.""",0.6510506820055498,0.34894931799445017,0.8011390414570134,839,5.036948748510131,407,6.0933660933660931,0,0,"Science, Report"

Because the Airlander uses inert helium to provide most of its lift, it can stay afloat for days with minimal fuel costs. When it does move it uses only a third of the fuel of regular planes (although it's much slower — only reaching speeds of up to 100mph), and its capacity to hover means it can land pretty much anywhere — including on water. The Airlander 10 also has one of the lowest carbon emissions of any aircraft in the world and is capable of carrying up to 50 tons of freight for distances up to 1,600 miles.   The craft was originally developed for long-term surveillance and reconnaissance by the US military, but when budget cuts meant the project was scrapped, it was bought back by HAV. Now, the company wants to develop it for a range of commercial purposes, including ""freight, remote access, aid distribution, advertising, surveillance, communications and luxury passenger transport.""

The next launch window is tomorrow at 4:10PM ET. This afternoon, SpaceX will send a Falcon 9 rocket to space that will deliver cargo to the International Space Station, including an espresso machine specially designed to work in space. Questionable weather has the launch at a 60 percent chance of happening, which is scheduled for 4:33PM ET. But today's launch is important for another reason: It will also be the third test of the company's modified reusable rocket. This is the third launch of the reusable Falcon 9 SpaceX's plan is to use four fins to stabilize the rocket, which measures 70 feet wide with the landing legs extended. The rocket will then lower itself onto the 300-by-100-foot autonomous barge, which is already in the ocean east of Cape Canaveral.   Odds of rocket landing successfully today are still less than 50%. The 80% figure by end of year is only bcs many launches ahead.  The first two attempts were troublesome. The initial try in January resulted in a catastrophic explosion when the rocket impacted the barge after a mistakenly speedy descent. When the company tried again in February, bad weather scrubbed the barge landing, and the rocket instead merely hovered over the ocean for a few moments before it sank.         Excessive costs are by far the biggest hurdle when it comes to space travel. That's why reusable rockets are such a big deal. By replacing the single-use rockets, space agencies as well as companies like SpaceX and the United Launch Alliance could save millions of dollars. We all know spaceflight is hard, so it's no surprise that SpaceX has hit a few bumps in this quest. But the company didn't miss success by much. While the first rocket erupted in a fireball worthy of a Michael Bay film, it missed the target on the barge by a matter of feet. The second apparently was even closer, according to the data collected by SpaceX, even if the rough seas kept the barge docked. The espresso machine — cleverly named ISSpresso — was made by Italian coffee company Lavazza in conjunction with an engineering firm and the Italian Space Agency, and NASA has certified its safety. The ability to sip espresso from a pouch won't give the astronauts any nutritional benefits, but it could help the psychological side of things. Any comfort that can be afforded to the astronauts while they work in solitude — whether it's coffee, television, or even Thanksgiving dinner — is important for morale, especially considering two of the crew just began a year-long stay on the station.

I think Shaw takes a tire iron to the face at some point, but it just leaves a little scuff on his forehead. When they graduate from that, they decide to crash their cars head-on like a pair dueling rams with testosterone pumping through their veins. No need to worry about either of them getting hurt though — car crashes can't kill superheroes. And Dom knows this. After he's cornered during one chase scene, the criminal — once a mere street racer — decides his best escape plan is to drive off a sheer cliff, tumbling and crashing his way to the bottom. But, you know, since there wasn't any kryptonite at the bottom, he's able to brush it off. One-thousand-foot drops? Ain't no thing.   This is what happens when you have an endless series of films that are held together with hardly a semblance of plot. Unlike other epic film sagas, say, Star Wars, in which each sequel ostensibly serves to develop a larger storyline, the Furious films are stuck playing a juvenile game of one-upmanship. There's nothing wrong with stupid fun at the movie theater, but it's as if the filmmakers decided there was nothing of value in the Fast and Furious franchise other than the crazy stunts. Therefore, they must have reasoned, the only way to make a better movie is to make it bigger, crazier, and even less realistic. Seven movies in and it's now a silly game of one-upmanship Does that sound familiar? It should — with the deluge of superhero flicks over the past decade, nearly every one has resorted to bigger fights and even more destruction to try and get noticed. If you want an example, just look at the progression from Batman Begins to the mess that is The Dark Knight Rises. The thing is, at a certain point, outlandish stunts are self-defeating. If it's too much, too over-the-top, the audience just doesn't buy it. There are no stakes. If Dom and the gang aren't carefully straddling the thin line between life and death, there isn't much to get the adrenaline pumping. And once the filmmakers blast through the audience's suspension of disbelief, there's just no getting it back. At that point, we know there's no risk to jumping between Abu Dhabi's skyscrapers or parachuting out of a Boeing C-17 in a muscle car. At least those set pieces are fun — but when we know there are no stakes and Dom and Shaw engage in yet another machismo head-on collision, it's just pointless and mind-numbing.   The filmmakers' self-imposed mission to one-up previous entries like Fast Five and Fast & Furious 6 also just leads to some awful decisions. In Furious 7, it all culminates in a preposterous fight across the streets of LA. Some sci-fi drone jet with an endless supply of rockets blows up everything, Hobbs picks up a gigantic minigun, and half of LA gets reduced to rubble. Oh, and Dom survives a building collapse after getting blown up by a missile. The filmmakers abandoned what made the earlier Fast and Furious films good in the mindless pursuit of bigger explosions. Furious 7 is afraid of death And, it must be said, this all comes with the eerie backdrop of Paul Walker's tragic death. His likeness wanders through the movie as a stark reminder of our mortality. All the while, Furious 7 appears to be in complete denial of that fact. Like a ghost, Paul Walker seems to fade into the ether at the end of the film. He's gone forever, but he's not dead. It's like they decided to honor his death by ignoring it. For a movie with so much destruction, Furious 7 seems awfully afraid of death.

He just needs $48 million to do it.  French architect and oceanographer Jacques Rougerie has spent more than 30 years researching underwater habitats, and even launched his own design firm for that purpose. His pet project, though, is considerably more ambitious. Drawing inspiration from Jules Verne's Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea, Rougerie's SeaOrbiter is a 190-foot tall floating laboratory — complete with space simulator and submersible garage. The SeaOrbiter has been in development for the better part of a decade. Meant to run on a combination of solar and wind power, Rougerie wants the vessel to be as sustainable and unobtrusive to oceanic ecosystems as possible. The facility would be run by a crew of at least 18 people, who would serve to observe life above and below water, manage data, and explore the depths in an array of submersibles that can be used to collect samples. In addition, the submerged part of the vessel houses simulators, meant to gauge how humans might cope with long-term space travel. The dream is for the ship to help better explore the world's oceans, 95 percent of which remain unexplored. Already equipped with a clear vision, the only obstacle left is funding. While Rougerie managed to raise an impressive $466 thousand via French crowdfunding site KissKissBankBank earlier this year, the total cost of launching the SeaOrbiter is approximately $48 million. If he succeeds, he can launch the craft by year's end in 2016. Here's hoping he pulls it off.  A cross section of the SeaOrbiter, showing the crew at work.

Aquanauts would able to explore the ocean by diving or relying on the SeaOrbiter's submersible crafts. Those on the vessel could conduct research 24/7 anywhere in the world.

The $5 billion Atlantic Yards development includes the newly built Barclays Center, roughly 6,000 apartments, and hundreds of thousands of square feet of office and retail space. However, like most major redevelopment projects, Atlantic Yards has come against stiff competition from locals, and progress has been slow since the original plans were approved in 2006. Now a few architecture firms are tossing out some wild ideas for how they would improve the project if it was entrusted to them. A new gallery exhibit features five different ideas for phase two of the project, which has yet to begin construction. The current approved plan calls for 11 residential buildings in phase two. Residents have complained that the structures are an inefficient use of space and say they don't fit into the surrounding (brownstone-filled) neighborhood. These five new proposals, in turn, seek to ""explore the site’s development potential while respecting historic scale and context, activating public-private space interaction, and integrating characteristics of the urban streets that surround the site,"" according to a statement. Each of the designs adhere to the most recent guidelines for the project, which were approved in 2009, and the organizer of the exhibit tells Fast Company that the proposals are ""intended to illustrate to the community that there are alternative architectural possibilities, all equally profitable for the developer.” It just so happens that the ideas are way outside of the box.  Perhaps the most radical proposal comes from OPerA Studio Architecture. The so-called ""Garden in the Machine"" proposal uses dramatic sloping rooflines to try and fit the massive development into the low-lying areas nearby. The largest buildings are near Atlantic Terminal, where additional space makes it better suited to high-rise developments. The proposal calls for green space on top of the buildings, which allows the development to use more of the allotted land for residential units — helping to keep the buildings as short as possible. The ""Flexible City"" proposal by Matthias Altwicker and Farzana Gandhi is truly modular. The architects note that large developments often fail to be relevant over time. To address this, they've designed each unit in the building to be easily adaptable, allowing it to switch from residential to office to retail, for instance.  The architects say the project — which includes public spaces throughout the floorplans —  is ""a new model for urban development at this scale"" that ""is programmatically, infrastructurally, and contextually flexible to the forces that define its long-standing value."" Amoia Cody Architecture says its proposal emulates the design of nearby brownstones by utilizing public greenspace as pseudo ""backyards."" Sky terraces serve to create townhouses in the sky, with groupings of one to four families sharing a single outdoor space. The ""Vertical Lots"" proposal, like ""Garden in the Machine,"" places taller buildings near Atlantic Terminal, away from the brownstones. The ""Quilted City"" proposal from Joshua Zinder Architecture and Design calls for relocating Atlantic Terminal in order to properly incorporate with the development. They say the (costly) plan serves to ""animate the internal green space"" and ""give it a constant source of life and movement."" By mixing and matching the high rises and low-rise buildings, the architects hoped to create a more natural, comfortable public spaces.  The last proposal, by David Cunningham Architecture Planning, is concerned more with the surrounding neighborhood than the Atlantic Yards site itself. The proposal calls for adjusting the streets of the nearby blocks and connect two parts. To keep building short while handlingly the number of units required by the plan, the architects are using land across the street that's not currently part of the project. This is the render for the current Atlantic Yards project, which is currently being constructed despite significant delays. The buildings are far less radical than the latest ideas, though the designers plan to revolutionize modular building methods with an on-site factory to save money on development.

When residents download the app and go for a bike ride, they can choose to have their route recorded by the app. Select single rides are printed on the final art pieces in real-time, but all of them are recorded for keeping track of where most people are riding. That information can then be used as ammunition in the fight to get bike lanes built in the city, which was recently rated by one group as the least bike-friendly city in Germany.

As a biomedical computing student at Queen’s University seven years ago, Justin Lee knew he wanted to build his own ""internet of things"" device — but he didn’t want it to be any old ""smart"" lamp, toaster, or light switch. ""I wanted to put a computer into one of the most ubiquitous objects in the history of the human race,"" he says. He chose the cup. Then, he enlisted Yves Béhar, the esteemed designer behind Jawbone and the OLPC, to build it. The result is Vessyl, a 13-ounce cup that recognizes any beverage you pour into it, displays its nutritional content, and syncs all your drinking habits to your smartphone. Let’s cut to the chase: while I only had an hour with a Vessyl prototype, I tried nearly a dozen beverages in it — and it successfully identified all of them. Within 10 seconds, the device, which currently resembles more of a Thermos than a finished product, recognized Crush orange soda, Vitamin Water XXX, Tropicana orange juice, Gatorade Cool Blue, plain-old water, and a few other beverages, all by name. Yes, this cup knows the difference between Gatorade Cool Blue and Glacier Freeze.   Vessyl can tell the difference between strong and weak coffee, Lee says, noting caffeine disparities. It can even measure the sugar, protein, calories, fat, and caffeine inside any beverage you pour into it, mass-produced or homemade. As you go about your day, the device tracks how much you’re drinking, and when you tilt Vessyl to its back, it displays a bright blue line that rises and falls to indicate your hydration level. Lee plans to ship Vessyl in early 2015 at a cost of $199.99, though preorders are available now for $99. Building a smart cup made even more sense once Lee started thinking about the various ways we track our movement, but not what we’re eating. Even sleek apps like Up Coffee, which tracks your caffeine consumption, require you to input your consumption manually drink by drink. The big idea behind Vessyl is to provide transparency, automatically, about how terrible most of our drinking habits are. And Vessyl might just succeed. Many of us already carry around some kind of water bottle, after all, be it a Nalgene bottle or Kleen Kanteen, and Vessyl can take advantage of that habit. Vessyl imagesPreviousNextView full GalleryPreviousNext ""Consumption is as important or more important as what we track through exercise,"" says Lee, ""so we developed a sensor that could instantly analyze the nutritional content of what’s inside a beverage … on a molecular level."" Lee won’t say exactly how the sensor works. He likens it to the kind of sensor you’d find in a bottling factory that analyzes batches of liquid (or other foods) to make sure each batch is consistent. ""It’s the kind of sensor you’d use for quality control,"" Lee says, ""and the sensor doesn’t degrade. It’s non-contact."" There’s no hole, or singular point where Vessyl samples what you’re drinking — it just looks like an über-modern, but empty, cup. I press Lee for more information about how it works, but he won’t budge. ""The details of the sensor we’re keeping pretty close to the vest,"" he says, but notes that the device includes a processor and algorithms that match your beverage to one of thousands of beverages his team has tested with Vessyl. (And yes, Vessyl recognizes many kinds of beer and wine). Perhaps more impressive, however, is that Vessyl actually measures and displays the nutritional content of any beverage on the spot, even your homemade smoothie. In other words, Vessyl isn’t just drawing from its drink library when it displays nutritional data.   Vessyl is a neat party trick — until you start using it to actually make better habits. The content of every beverage you drink syncs back to your smartphone over Bluetooth low energy, but you can also choose one metric for the Vessyl cup to display on its side. When you pour coffee into Vessyl, for example, its display will read ""coffee"" — but you can choose whether Vessyl then displays the total mg of caffeine you've consumed today, or some other metric. Above this tiny display is a line that Lee calls Pryme, a measurement of how hydrated you are. Pryme is a proprietary hydration metric calculated using your height, weight, and other characteristics that you enter into the Vessyl app.   If you’re perfectly hydrated, Lee says, the Pryme bar will be full and a small blue light will illuminate above it. But as you go about your day, your Pryme will deplete. To activate the Pryme display at any time, you just pick up Vessyl and tilt it away from you. An accelerometer inside the device recognizes the gestures and illuminates the Pryme bar. The gesture is so natural and simple that some Vessyl users might not choose to check their stats inside the app, which displays your drinks over the course of a day along a sleek timeline. They might just tilt to check on their Pryme, and if they’re low, will bounce over to the kitchen for a refill. There’s no metal wristband to strap on every morning Vessyl’s greatest potential lies in its Pryme display. What person wouldn’t appreciate a simple indicator of how much water they should drink every day? You can indeed use Vessyl without the app after initial setup, which could truly separate Vessyl from most other fitness trackers and quantified-self gadgets on the market. Nike’s omnipresent NikeFuel points indicator is, arguably, one of the gadget’s most appealing aspects. But Vessyl’s strength is that unlike these other trackers, it combines effortless tracking with a behavior you’re already doing. There’s no metal wristband to strap on every morning, and no fob to clip to your pants pocket. If you leave Vessyl on its charging coaster while you sleep or are at your desk, you might forget that it’s a ""smart cup"" entirely. One 60-minute charge provides a week of power, Lee says. The big idea is to help you stay better hydrated on a daily basis, and while Vessyl won't send you a push notification quite yet when you're not drinking enough, they might not be far off. Vessyl’s primary virtue is that it’s easy to understand. ""Integrating breakthrough technology into everyday products is always a challenge, at the same time, this is exactly how design makes tech products easily adoptable in life,"" says Béhar. If Vessyl can succeed in accurately measuring what you’re drinking day after day, as Lee says it will, it just might be the first quantified-self tracker I could recommend to anyone.",0.646136035817838,0.35386396418216204,0.17041752009358282,1114,4.9039497307001794,561,6.0588235294117645,0,0,"Design, Tech, Report"

Below us, a pair of huge balloons sway gently on their tethers. Engineers are racing around them like ants.  Loon is being built with the audacious goal of beaming internet access down to the most remote parts of the planet, using specially equipped balloons that kiss the upper edges of Earth’s atmosphere. Today, the team is running an inflation test that will measure the pressure that the giant white spheres can handle before popping. The pressure hits 1000 pascal. “It usually doesn’t last much longer,” says Jabbari.   The ground crew radios up another report. ""We’re at 1,100 now,"" she continues. ""I don’t think it’s ever been this high without ripping before."" A bulge emerges on the far side of the balloon, and several engineers scurry over with a mass spectrometer, searching for tiny ruptures in the fabric, invisible to the naked eye, that might be leaking. ""Okay, we’re at 1,200; that is a new record,"" she says a few minutes later. ""I don’t really know what’s going to happen now."" That's a good metaphor for Project Loon as a whole. As it moves past the technical hurdles of floating the internet miles above the planet, Loon is poised to enter uncharted territory: building an actual business.  This morning, in front of top mobile executives from around the world, Google’s Sundar Pichai laid out a renewed pitch for Project Loon. ""[It] started about four years ago as an experimental idea. When you think about it, it sounds a bit crazy,"" Pichai admitted. But they've made ""huge progress,"" he says, dramatically increasing their data speeds and coverage area. The early models last only a few days; the goal for commercial viability was to have them floating for three months. ""Today we are excited to announce most of our balloons stay up for as long as six months,"" says Pichai. Loon was born out of a long-standing fascination that Google’s founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, had with high-altitude balloons. ""Either we could take something they hadn’t thought about, present it to them, and get them excited,"" explains Google X chief Astro Teller, ""or we could take something they were already excited about, but no one really knew how to do and make it work."" The man tasked with ""making it work"" is Mike Cassidy, a serial entrepreneur with a nose for the next big thing. I met up with him in a crowded lab on Google’s main campus, a 15-minute drive from the towering Moffett hangar where engineers were stressing Loon’s translucent shells to their limits. On his way to Google, Cassidy founded and sold four startups, including the search engine DirectHit, which AskJeeves bought for $532 million just 500 days after he launched it. Cassidy ended up at Google after it acquired his travel search startup, Ruba, in 2010. He spent some time working on Google’s core search product, but in 2012, Teller came calling. He needed someone with entrepreneurial experience — but Cassidy also possessed a unique set of skills which had been dormant for a while. ""I actually got my bachelor's and master's from MIT in aerospace engineering,"" Cassidy explains. Before jumping into the software startup game, he ""designed communication satellites for a while,"" where he saw firsthand how painstakingly slow the development process could be. ""It would take three to four years to build a satellite and a year waiting for it to launch. If it was on station for 10 to 12 years, at some point, you’re using technology that is five, seven, even 10 years old."" At Teller’s Google X, things move a little faster. The initial step in any of the team’s projects is simple, Cassidy explains: ""We try to prove that it can’t work. So the first thing we did was take a router and flew it on a weather balloon up to 10 kilometers to see if we could still get a signal. That part worked."" When you imagine a sensitive computer system that will be subjected to the harsh conditions of the stratosphere, you probably don’t picture it inside a $2 box meant for a picnic. But in the fast and dirty ethos of X Labs, the simplest solution is often the best one — and so it was that the flight controller on early balloons was jammed into a styrofoam beer cooler and set to the edge of outer space. The team keeps that original unit around as a memento. Since then, the payload has evolved into a modular aluminum rig wrapped in a metal-mylar blanket that insulates it from temperature changes and high-intensity ultraviolet rays. It’s suspended below two solar panels that collect all the energy used to power its onboard systems. The entire payload below the balloon looks very much like a miniature satellite, but takes a fraction of the time and money to produce. Google won’t divulge the exact cost, except to say each balloon costs ""tens of thousands of dollars."" ""Communication satellites are typically pretty expensive, hundreds of millions to build and a hundred million plus to launch,"" says Cassidy. ""Whereas the balloons are an order of magnitude or two cheaper to operate on a daily basis, even for a global network."" Loon is always aiming to extend the lifespan of its flights, but in some ways, a short ride can be an advantage. ""With balloons you’re only four to five months away from having a fresh balloon,"" Cassidy explains. ""New technologies come, new compression algorithms, the electronics can be updated, so you have a pretty fresh fleet in the air at any time."" Google isn’t the only company born on the internet trying to make the transition to internet access provider: Facebook is charting a similar course, launching a number of initiatives (including drones) with the goal of flooding the world with internet service. That raises a troubling question: as the world's internet superpowers use their dominant positions to extend access to the developing world, will they be ensuring that people can reach the web, or just a white-listed portion of it? In India, Facebook's Internet.org partnership — which is often styled as an altruistic endeavor — doesn’t include free access to Twitter, Google, or any other big name company that Facebook might view as a competitor. It’s essentially the antithesis of net neutrality. When I asked Cassidy if the internet enabled by Loon would be restricted in any way, or if Google would favor its own services, he seemed surprised by the question. ""I honestly don’t know. No, it’s the internet, whatever you get on the internet. It opens a Chrome browser and whatever you’ve set as your homepage."" Teller confirmed Loon’s internet would be agnostic — you don't even have to use Chrome — and that it could still benefit Google in the process. ""We believe that there is plenty of goodness and plenty of financial benefit in the long run for Google,"" he told me. ""We don’t need there to be some other goal."" You can’t just launch a bunch of balloons and connect the world, though: right now, Project Loon flies primarily over the southern hemisphere. That’s partially a question of where its services are most needed. Compared to the northern hemisphere, the southern half of the planet is far less densely populated, full of remote areas where broadband internet is less likely to reach. These countries also provide a more welcoming regulatory atmosphere. ""The southern hemisphere is pretty easy to overfly in terms of air traffic control,"" says Johan Mathe, a Frenchman in charge of designing Loon’s navigation. ""That’s one of the places where there is the least hand off to do."" Mathe strolls up to a whiteboard inside of one of the innumerable windowless conference room that dot the Googleplex. To navigate, he explains, the Loons only move up and down, surfing through different altitudes to find wind currents that will carry them where they want to go. Each Loon is actually two balloons, one inside the other. The outer balloon is filled with helium that lifts it to its float altitude, while the inner balloon takes on air to descend or vents it to rise, like a boat using water as ballast. Using massive data sets from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), Google’s algorithms try to decide which currents they should ride to pass over coverage areas. It’s a big data exercise that perfectly fits the company’s core capabilities. Mathe draws a rainbow on the board, a vast array of possible trajectories that each balloon will take based on the wind. ""We only get 15 days of weather data, and after five or six days, the quality degrades. We cannot foresee the future very precisely,"" explains Mathe. The algorithms he crafts try to begin by hitting a broad target.  ""As we get closer, we kick in more frequent altitude changes."" He shows a recent flight that launched from New Zealand, aiming to overfly a small town in Chile. It travels smoothly for a while, then begins to zigzag its way closer to the destination. ""We can observe this kind of tacking pattern, as sailors would do."" The balloon passed within 500 meters (about 1,640 feet) of the village and successfully connected to a device on the ground. The flows aren’t always that predictable. During a live demo in front of Brazil’s minister of communications, a balloon drifted directly away from the village it was supposed to connect. Another one took out electricity to homes in a Washington town when it missed its landing site and came to rest on a power line. ""Usually when you fly in the southern hemisphere, you stay there. At least that’s what we thought until we had a flight change hemispheres,"" says Mathe with a chuckle. ""We were like, ‘What!’ We thought that wasn’t possible. So that was pretty fun."" As the balloons crisscross the globe, educating governments about what Loon is and how it works will be critical to the project’s success. Countries like China, already outright hostile to Google’s web services, may have little interest in allowing the search giant to beam internet access to its citizens, something that would make it difficult to reach a neighbor like India as well. That could put a huge swathe of the world's unconnected consumers out of Loon's reach. The company declined to comment on when and how it might start flying regularly over that part of the globe. But even in developed nations with widespread internet access, there has been interest in what Loon’s unique approach could provide. Cassidy recently traveled to a meeting with Japanese officials in Tokyo. ""One of the great benefits of being in the stratosphere is that it’s above the weather,"" says Cassidy, when I ask him about the potential for flights over more of the developed world. ""If there is a hurricane or a typhoon that knocks out power or internet connectivity to people on the ground, the balloons provide very exciting ways to allow people to have immediate connectivity. As long as they have a battery powered phone in their pocket, people will be able to instantly get access to the balloon network."" Last year, Project Loon switched its payloads from Wi-Fi to LTE — ""floating cell towers in the sky,"" Cassidy calls them — which led to big improvements in speed and reliability. For connectivity the balloons link up with base stations and pass signal between themselves like relay runners exchanging a baton. The move to LTE has also given a big boost to the business model, because it’s now a turnkey solution for wireless network operators. ""The main reason the telcos are so excited about partnering with us is that they want to reach all the people in their country,"" says Cassidy. In fact, in many cases there is a government mandate for universal access — but building out wireline networks, cell towers, and fiber optics to remote rural regions isn’t cost effective. ""Flying a balloon overhead, on the other hand, can be done very cheaply."" The team recently crossed another milestone with its first successful connection test across multiple continents. Balloons launched in New Zealand flew over 9,000 kilometers (about 5,600 miles) to Latin America and delivered an internet connection, then flew back around the globe for another successful connection test in Australia, navigating the balloons within 500 meters of their target locations at opposite ends of the world. Loon has now conducted tests with Vodafone in New Zealand, Telstra in Australia, and Telefonica in Latin America, and it says it’s working on commercial deals with several new network operators around the globe. These companies already own the spectrum and have the infrastructure in place to market, sell, and bill customers for service. Google gets permission to use the spectrum and provides the cell towers in the sky, sharing the revenue for each new customer with the telco. ""Sometimes people think of Google X as a research lab. But it’s not just that,"" says Cassidy. ""Very early on in the project analysis it has to have a viable business model, and they are tough on the business model."" As Cassidy speaks, his voice rises with excitement, and you can recognize the former startup savant coming to the fore. ""Think about it — with 4.5 billion people without internet access, take 5 percent; you’re talking 250 million people,"" he says. If those people pay just a small portion of their monthly income, say $5 a piece, ""you’re going to be in a billion dollars a month in revenue, tens of billions a year in revenue. So it’s good business, too."" Back at Moffett, the sun is setting, casting long shadows through the enormous bay doors. High up in the rafters, I’ve got my camera trained on the Loons below, hoping to catch the moment they explode. But I miss: with a silent slump, the balloon below me rents open and starts to crumple on itself. A small cheer goes up from the engineering team, who clamber inside through the tears to access the damage and see what they can improve for next time. Pamela Desrochers, a former fashion designer turned Loon program manager, is inside the carcass. She has obsessed over every detail of how to make the Loons last longer, from the materials to the special socks manufacturing workers now have to wear when walking on them. In this hangar, Loon staff are hyper-focused on finding better construction techniques, but it's clear that Loon is just a piece of a much grander puzzle — a puzzle that now involves balloons, satellites, fiber, and terrestrial wireless. Google, like Facebook, is looking to provide internet access so that its services can reach every corner of the globe, no matter how remote.

The Bay Area is already blessed with a growing number of apps that deliver weed to your door, but Flow Kana claims it gives farmers much better margins. On Thursday, the startup invited me to a launch party at an undisclosed location in the Berkeley hills. Flow Kana was promising hors d’oeuvres and drinks ""paired with curated ‘intermezzos’ of cannabis treats and boutique flowers."" Finally, a product I want to unbox! The invite also pledged to teach us more about the burgeoning ""clean cannabis"" movement. (Don’t bother Googling it, the movement hasn’t made its way online.) Flow Kana CEO Michael Steinmetz uses the term to mean organic, sustainably grown pot, delivered ""farm to table,"" if your table is where you keep your bong. He says Flow Kana — which is currently invitation-only — will also have ""almost zero carbon footprint,"" because its couriers will tool around San Francisco on bicycles carrying jars filled with an eighth of a pound of weed from every partnering farm. Farm-to-table marijuana Flow Kana’s party invitation called for formal dress: ""Great Gatsby meets California."" I was coming from work, though, and ended up closer to ""Urban Outfitters catalog meets Pennsylvania."" And for a weed party, getting there was no chill sitch. Guests had to catch a shuttle from a UC Berkeley parking lot, located 20 minutes from the nearest BART station. As soon as the shuttle driver began our rickety ride ascent up a very narrow road, a pre-recorded message about Flow Kana started blasting on speakers. The backing instrumentals recalled the tuning of a violin. I recognized Steinmetz’s voice by his Venezuelan accent. With legalization on the horizon, his voiceover intoned, it’s critical to ask ourselves the ""important questions,"" such as ""Who is going to grow my cannabis, and with what values?"" Not my first question, but sure!   The mystery location was a house made of redwood trees. Flow Kana staffers stood helpfully on either side of the road to make sure we didn’t wander into the wrong organic mansion. A woman wearing a crown of flowers welcomed us inside. Later, she and the other ""flower girls"" would pass around wooden trays covered with joints rolled into such symmetrical cylinders I thought they were taffy. The view from the top of the hill made me forget how I got there. As did the house itself. I made my way through the corridor festooned with pillows and the swag table covered in mini-succulents for guests to take home. Flower girls holding perfect joints I struck up a conversation with Stephen, the lithe middle-aged black gentleman perched next to me, who turned out to be the owner of the house. He said it was designed by Frank Lloyd Wright’s protégé Daniel Lieberman, who built it to mimic the structure of an open umbrella. The steel poles in the center that went down hundreds of feet into the bedrock were the umbrella shaft. The umbrella spokes, canopy, and the slats of the railing were all made of redwood. ""They can’t even get that stuff anymore,"" he said, pointing to a beam that extended the length of two floors. ""Must’ve cost a lot,"" I hinted, hoping to get an exact price. ""Uh, yeah,"" he replied, casually surveying his indoor forrest. ""Anytime you spend millions …"" What did he do when he wasn’t keeping an eye on startup parties? ""I’m launching a private social network called The Karma Society,"" said Stephen. It’s for world travelers who need recommendations in other cities. He described it as ""like Facebook, but more of a high-end Vogue / GQ Facebook."" Many of the guests adhered to the Gatsby theme, or were at least much better dressed than I was. The bright green-and-red lighting scheme felt more ""turnkey tent at Burning Man"" than startup, although there was some business to attend to. Dispensaries are too greedy Before everyone could get high, we had to listen to six speeches. Steinmetz never really told the crowd how Flow Kana came to be, so allow me. He used to run a food distribution company in Venezuela and came to California to explore the opportunities created by legalization. While working as a consultant at a local dispensary, Steinmetz told me on the phone earlier, he came to realize it was an ""unhealthy industry."" ""Reasonable"" margins taken by retail operations are 20 to 30 percent, Steinmetz says, but dispensaries are taking up to 85 percent. He visited Humboldt County, where much of the state’s high-grade marijuana is grown, and found an ""almost abandoned town,"" despite its sizable GDP. After meeting some farmers, he concluded that they were ""very much getting the shitty end of the deal.""   Under California law, only medical marijuana dispensaries, co-ops, or collectives can deliver weed, so he helped create a nonprofit farmers cooperative. ""Think of it as a dispensary, except it’s a nonprofit farmers cooperative,"" he said. Flow Kana takes a 25 percent cut for deliveries, and the farmers can reinvest profits in the cooperative in the form of solar-panel subsidies and such. When I asked how this was legal, Steinmetz uttered my five least favorite words: ""We are a technology platform."" (It’s the same line used by Uber and Airbnb to evade all manner of regulation.) In other words, it’s a middleman between farmers and their ""patients."" At the party that night, Steinmetz said legalization could mean small-farm subsidies that would ""trigger an agricultural revolution."" A few minutes later, he described a promotional clip for Flow Kana as ""a little manifesto video."" ""To some, it’s medicine; to some, cognitive ecstasy; to others, it’s a sense of community and a sense of belonging,"" Steinmetz said. The audience cheered after ""ecstasy."" The audience cheered after ""ecstasy"" One recurring theme during the presentations was how much secrecy has been required of these small operations. Hezekiah Allen, chair and director of an advocacy group called Emerald Growers Association, is also a third-generation cannabis farmer from Southern Humboldt County. Emerald’s 180 members reported annual revenues of $8,000 to $2.2 million. Current estimates, he said, put the tally at 53,000 small farms, many of which are new. ""They grew up in prohibition. They don’t look like farms. They’re in warehouses,"" he said. ""When I grew up, we were scattered around in the forest because we were hiding from the Marine Corps and the helicopters giving the children trauma."" No one quite knew how to react. Allen is focused on changing policy. ""What I want California to realize is that we have world-class craft cannabis growers in California,"" he said, and that the value was something to be proud of. My ears perked up. Any time the word ""craft"" is uttered, money is sure to follow. Finally we got to meet one of those farmers: Casey O’Neill, an activist and farmer-owner of HappyDay Farms in Mendocino. O’Neill was wearing a white t-shirt with his farm’s name and brown corduroys, and he spoke in a low, syrupy drawl. He said it meant a lot as a farmer to be at this event and ""to do honor to the medicine."" His farm also grows vegetables, and it boggles O’Neill’s mind that he has to ""somehow separate the medicinal value of my broccoli from my cannabis. It’s back to Hippocrates: ‘Let thy food be thy medicine, medicine thy food.’"" Word. The house became a fog of smoke After O’Neill came Nicholas Smilgys, a founding member of Sparc, a dispensary in San Francisco, who tried to convey the vast superiority of clean cannabis to its unclean cousins. ""On-demand"" access from Flow Kana, he said, could also solve San Francisco clustering issues. ""No one wants a cannabis dispensary in their backyard. Well now they don’t have to have one. They can just order Flow Kana!"" With that, the flower girls were off. In a matter of minutes the house become a fog of smoke. An aerialist started winding her way to the ceiling on a long swath of red silk.   There was no need to hunt for a flower girl; one was waiting for me at the bottom of the stairs. She also saved me from lighting up the wrong end of my locally sourced Mendocino joint. I passed it along to one of the workers from HappyFarms, who was more than happy to take it. Accidentally eating a dessert empanada Whatever I smoked definitely made me feel goooooooood. Very mellow, zero paranoia or sleepiness, just pleasantly elevated and in a generous mood — happy to be there, inside a redwood umbrella with all these fine people. I wandered outside to check out the view and accidentally ate a dessert empanada that I thought was savory. Reporters from TechCrunch and Mashable were milling by the sweets station. Upstairs, I ran into my friend Chris Roberts, who has been covering the cannabis industry for SF Weekly and The San Fransisco Examiner, as well as the publisher’s new site: SF Evergreen, focused exclusively on marijuana news and culture. I don’t have his discerning palette, but Chris said there was a serious difference between ""top-flight"" outdoor weed and the stuff grown indoors. The good stuff gives you a ""less lethargic, more euphoric feeling,"" and is better for pain relief and anxiety. ""It’s not bullshit!"" He also said the prices would drop for indoor growers after legalization. The conspiracy theory was that tobacco companies like Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds would buy up all the farms in Humboldt and Mendocino. But that’s crazy talk, he said. No, no, when ""Big Marijuana"" comes to California, they’re going to set up shop in Central Valley where it’s sunny year-round. (""Big Marijuana"" is actually a thing, so go ahead and Google that.) We chatted for awhile, occasionally losing our train of thought. The waiters and flower girls passed around more mini beef wellingtons, mini burgers, and laffy taffy, but one puff was enough for me. My return trip was a breeze. An SUV showed up in under 10 minutes to go back down the hill and was blissfully voiceover-free. When I transferred between BART lines at MacArthur station, the train I needed was idling across the platform. I found a seat and listened to ""Novacane"" on loop for most of the way home.",0.5453689341553872,0.45463106584461277,0.8486506575151246,1731,4.94685153090699,931,6.3512352309344786,0,6,"Apps, Business, Culture, Tech, Report"

As it grew like mad, CEO Jason Goldberg talked about taking on titans like Target and Ikea. The company had 750 employees and more than $330 million in funding at its peak. But just as quickly, that all fell apart. The company burned through most of its funding and laid off the majority of its employees. Today, it was officially purchased by PCH International, which plans to use Fab as a sales channel for the hardware products it designs and manufactures. As we reported back in November of 2013, this was not the first time Goldberg had rapidly scaled a company, piled on funding, and then had the whole thing implode. That story played out with Jobster, his first big startup, which was sold for pennies on the dollar. Fab is reportedly going the same way, selling to PCH for around $15 million. About 35 employees will join PCH and stay on to run Fab. Goldberg has decamped to Berlin, where he is focused full time on Hem.com, a furniture company that designs and sells its own merchandise. He reportedly has about 100 former Fab employees working with him at Hem, and tens of millions in funding from Fab that his backers have agreed to funnel into this new venture instead. Ever the optimist, Goldberg celebrated the purchase with a blog post. ""It’s personally very satisfying to see Fab land in a great place with PCH. PCH is known for its world-class operations and its deep appreciation for brand, design, and the customer experience. PCH is the perfect home for Fab.""

Log in to your Disqus account, and you'll find a news feed with stories from the people, blogs, and websites you follow on the network. You'll also see the latest comments on your own site, if you have one, and recommendations for other commenters to follow. And for the first time, Disqus is creating standalone forums that are separate from article pages. The service's new news feed shows you recent comments on your own blog, if you have one, and recommendations for other commenters to follow. Like most social networks, it notifies you when someone replies to you, up-votes your comments, or invites you to a discussion. New standalone forums give Disqus a Reddit-like feel But the most interesting thing here is in its standalone forums, which represent the first time Disqus has hosted discussions away from its core widget. The first two forums are for fashion and movies; you can join any of the discussions there or create your own. It feels a bit like Reddit if it was made by people obsessed with comments — which are given equal weight as the original posts, visually:   Until now, Disqus has been little more than boring, back-end infrastructure. Most of us don't know which commenting platform we're using until it asks us to log in, at which point we have to remember if our Disqus password is the same one we use for Livefyre, or Facebook, or whatever. Disqus is one of the older players in the game; it claims to run on 3 million websites, receiving 2 billion impressions a month. The company makes money selling ads, mostly for other articles: the commenting box features promoted stories from other websites. Building a site that can stand by itself And that's all ... fine? But it's not successful at the scale of Reddit, which has once again become a darling of the startup world after being spun out of Conde Nast and raising an additional $50 million. Reddit's forums have proven irresistible to 160 million monthly readers and attract the kind of daily users irresistible to advertisers. Disqus' social network represents an effort to use its existing base of article commenters to create something durable that stands apart from other people's blogs. (Which is, after all, a shrinking market.) At least, that's what I think — Disqus is being rather cagey about the whole thing. This is all Steve Roy, the company's vice president of marketing, would tell me: ""We think there's a big opportunity to make communities and forums more accessible to the average person,"" he said in an email. ""Channels are our opportunity to take what we've learned about discussions on the web and make joining, finding, and starting them a primary experience."" In time, we should expect the new, feed-oriented version of Disqus to surface as a mobile app. On one hand, I don't love internet comments — many writers do not! — but I'm also a daily browser of Reddit. The latter understood long ago that topical forums can attract far more users than individual blogs. Disqus now seems to be coming around, however belatedly, to that line of thinking.

The milestone follows a month of surging ticket sales in China against a background of slowing box office results in the United States. In particular, the Reporter notes that the Lunar New Year played a big role in boosting China's ticket sales in February. February is also a famously bad month for movies in the US. That all said, this isn't exactly an anomaly, and it goes to underscore exactly how important Chinese audiences have become and will continue to be for Hollywood to cater to.  Hollywood movies weren't even the biggest players What may scare Hollywood most about these figures is that its own movies didn't play a big role. The New York Times reports that foreign films aren't typically screened around the Lunar New Year, leaving room for films that were made, at least in part, domestically. The two biggest Hollywood movies in China during February were The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies and The Hunger Games: Mockingjay — Part 1, which took in $36 million and $35.5 million respectively, according to the Reporter. That's not a huge sum, particularly compared to what the country's top films brought in: $104 million from The Man From Macau II; $95 million for Dragon Blade (which stars Jackie Chan, and — interestingly enough — John Cusack and Adrien Brody); and $72 million from Wolf Totem. While Hollywood films didn't have a big presence last month, that isn't a sign that they aren't succeeding. The Reporter points out that China's second biggest box office month, July of 2014 with $580 million, succeeded in large part thanks to Transformers: Age of Extinction. The United States is still the largest movie market, according to the Times, but China, in second place, is quickly growing, adding thousands of more movie screens in response to that growth while the United States' total stays flat. Hollywood may not be able to reverse the box office trend in the US, but the growth in China suggests that it'll still have huge audiences to play to for some time.",0.3750299769123513,0.6249700230876487,0.8576363443891225,373,4.8391420911528149,214,5.4672897196261685,0,0,"Business, Culture, Entertainment"

The local government is claiming that UberX vehicles are not legally authorized taxis, even inciting locals to tattle on Uber drivers who could then be fined 1 million KRW (about $900). In response, Uber now allows free travel on up to 30 UberX journeys, costing 30,000KRW (about $27) or less. No end date for the free promotion has been announced. The local government claims that Uber drivers are breaking the law by operating as an illegal taxi service. Uber representative In-Ang Park tells The Verge that the company wants to work with the local government to find an amicable solution. ""Uber launched UberX with the expectation that Seoul would be supportive and legalize ride-sharing in keeping with its sharing economy vision,"" said Park. ""But the reality was not what we expected, and so we need to take active steps to work with the city to find a way forward. We hope the city will accept this move."" ""Switching off the fare brings us within the law."" Uber hopes the decision to make UberX rides free will keep them in line with regulations defined by Seoul’s local authorities. ""The important thing,"" says Park, ""is that switching off the fare brings us within the law. We are continuing the dialogue with the city on a future path."" Park said that the company will continue paying drivers and emphasized that it will also cover their expenses in full. Even before I had heard about the free promotion, I received a 20,000KRW (about $20) credit on Uber for my first ride. I wasn’t sure, but a friend strongly suggested that I at least try it. After all, it would be deducted from my credit, and it had just started to rain. I used the Uber app to reserve an UberX vehicle near me and waited five minutes for it to arrive. Normally I can just walk outside and hail a cab, but since it was raining I had to call a taxi company which takes longer. And if no taxis are available, I have to call another company. It's not much more complicated but sometimes it takes longer.  My receipt for 0KRW  The ride was pleasant as the driver didn’t talk at all, letting me ride in silence with rain drops gently knocking on the windows of the back seat. As I hopped off at my destination, I was surprised to see that the price of the ride was 0KRW. I checked my credit, and the 20,000KRW was still there. I hurried inside a nearby cafe and opened Twitter to see my friends tweeting about free UberX rides. My free journey occurred around five hours before the promotion was even supposed to start, so out of curiosity I took another UberX ride back home to talk with another Uber driver. On my return journey I had a short conversation with the driver regarding what the promotion meant for him in terms of income. He told me that Uber drivers normally get paid more than a regular taxi job in Seoul, and during the promotion they will be paid an incentive on top of their regular payment.  I will probably reserve an UberX ride from now on As a first-time Uber customer, everything was perfect. Maybe I was lucky to have a car nearby where I was, but I was able to get both UberX rides in less than five minutes. I didn’t have to rummage through my bag to look for my wallet and wait for the driver to take my credit card, swipe it, and then wait for the receipt. I only had to say goodbye.  In the end it’s up to the passengers to decide if ride-sharing is useful or not. Based on my experience as a taxi addict, I will probably reserve an UberX ride from now on. Of course, that's exactly the kind of reaction this campaign is meant to inspire, making it that much harder for the government to ignore the people of Seoul and shut Uber down.",0.40198415805431875,0.5980158419456812,0.8462676958736925,690,4.4376811594202898,349,5.5386819484240686,0,2,"Business, Transportation, Report"

Recode reports that the acquisition price was in the realm of $280 million.    Paydiant is already working with huge retailers  Paydiant's tech allows merchants to build mobile payments, loyalty cards, and offers into their apps. It's up to each retailer to choose which services they want to offer and how they want those services to work, enabling the features either through NFC or QR codes. The idea is that each retailer can build whatever makes the most sense for their customers, but the reality is that — at least in the case of MCX — they're building what makes the most sense for their businesses: an app that uses mobile payments to try to kill the credit card (and, therefore, its related fees). Whether consumers like the results or not, retailers want an alternative to Apple Pay (as well as Google Wallet, Samsung Pay, and whenever else comes along next), and that's what Paydiant offers. That makes this acquisition, which is expected to close in late March or April, a big one for PayPal, placing it in a prime position in the mobile payments world and building on its 2013 acquisition of Braintree. PayPal has long had a dominating role in online payments, but it's increasingly been fighting for a role in stores. There's no guarantee that what Paydiant is offering will catch on, but it's clear that retailers want it to. In a separate announcement, PayPal also said today that it is releasing a new version of its Here card reader. The new version includes support for NFC, which ties in nicely with the work that Paydiant is doing.

The Patriot Act is set to expire at the end of the month, and the USA Freedom Act would have extended large portions of the act in modified form. Tonight's failure to arrive at a vote makes it likely that many of those powers will automatically expire, although Senate Majority Leader McConnell (R-KY) scheduled a last-minute session on May 31st for one last shot at passing the bill. In particular, the USA Freedom Act would have modified the Section 215 of the Patriot Act, a clause that allows the FBI to secretly order the collection of ""tangible things"" that could help in a national security investigation. Since its passage, Section 215 has been interpreted loosely — and likely illegally — by intelligence agencies. As whistleblower Edward Snowden revealed in 2013, the definition of both ""tangible things"" and ""investigation"" was broad enough to let NSA build a large database of American phone records for an ongoing, expansive national security effort. After the program was discovered, President Obama ordered the NSA to get approval before searching the database, but the phone metadata orders have still been renewed every three months. Government reports have said that there's little evidence the phone records program foiled any terrorist plots, however, and a recent court decision found that it wasn't legal at all by the standards of Section 215. Bye extra transparency. Bye FISA advocate. Bye 214, NSL reform.   Sunset the bastard.  The provision has also been used for tracking more than phone records. This week, the Justice Department's Office of the Inspector General released a review of Section 215. While it's partially redacted, the document describes FBI requests for records that ""range from reproductions of hard copy reproductions of business ledgers and receipts to gigabytes of metadata and other electronic information,"" including email records. This might not necessarily be problematic in itself, but the report notes that requests could cover ""groups composed of unknown members"" and people who weren't actually associated with investigations, with the justification that they were still relevant to the investigation. Originally, the USA Freedom Act was a relatively broad reform bill, tightening the language of national security rules and adding more transparency requirements. Since its introduction, though, it had been revised several times — a watered-down version passed the House last year, and a stronger version died in the Senate. The House brought a new version of bill back and passed it earlier this month, but the bill faced significant opposition in the Senate. Most notably, Rand Paul has staged a series of non-procedural filibusters in symbolic opposition to the bill, including a speech today that pushed the Senate vote past midnight.",0.34485890898788973,0.6551410910121103,0.8640542151795706,471,5.2866242038216562,280,6.3964285714285714,0,0,"Policy & Law, US & World, National Security"

I'm Jamieson, I'm still your host, and I'm happy to bring you another week's worth of fine tracks. The internet's still spilling over with tons of summery cuts, hopefully some of them you'll be hearing for the first time here. There's a Spotify playlist at the end for your listening convenience, and feel free to share your own favorite cuts / compliments / complaints from this week in the comments. Let's go: Albert Hammond, Jr., ""Razors Edge"" Here's an incontrovertible fact for you: Albert Hammond, Jr. has had the best solo career of any member of The Strokes by a country mile. He works with the same basic toolbox — those gleaming, sharp riffs, quick pace, Day-Glo guitar melodies — but adds a dash of anxiety and a sprinkle of wit. ""Razors Edge"" is an absolute romp, and at the very least it's the best Strokes-affiliated song since Angles. I'm willing to argue it's the best since... the last time AHJ topped the band on his own, back in 2008. Spare a moment for ""GfC."" Autre Ne Veut, ""World War Pt. 2"" Arthur Ashin registered an iconic moment in the proud history of cerebral white men paying tribute to Prince with ""Play by Play,"" the overwrought, wracking highlight of 2013's Anxiety. (""I just called you up to get that play by play"" is right up there with ""Here's my number / so call me maybe"" and ""I know when that hotline bling / that can only mean one thing"" in the annals of recent lyrics about making phone calls.) ""World War Pt. 2"" is the first single from the upcoming Age of Transparency. It doesn't have the same scale as ""Play by Play,"" but it's just as intimate and idiosyncratic. Beach Slang, ""Bad Art & Weirdo Ideas"" I have one problem with this Beach Slang song, which is an otherwise vital and piercing and urgent piece of rock music. There's some piece of sound in the background that sounds exactly like a Slack notification, and every time I hear it I'm driven to check all of my chats and windows only to find them empty. This is like some sort of Sisyphean hell for a music critic: an eternity spent listening to a song you like and being interrupted by phantom messages from your co-workers and friends. (I need help.) I hope your listening experience is untainted. Deradoorian, ""Komodo"" I'm still trying to wrap my head around this beguiling, bubbling piece of art-pop from the former Dirty Projector, whose debut full-length is coming out later this month. It's like a transmission from some secret garden, one you can feel but can't see; it makes me want to drink green tea, and I'm Team Coffee forever. If you're looking to relax after a long week at the office, this might help. EL VY, ""Return to the Moon"" I like The National as much as any music fan who came of age reading Pitchfork in the mid-'00s, but I have to be in a specific mood to listen to them. It's not every night I end up sitting on the couch drinking red wine and feeling dour, you know? EL VY is the new project from the band's lyricist / vocalist, Matt Berninger, and indie rock vet Brent Knopf, and it's just upbeat and spiky enough to fit into any evening. There's still plenty of Alligator DNA in there, but you're not going to bum everyone out if you throw this onto a porch party playlist. Jamie Woon, ""Sharpness"" Jamie Woon released one excellent single and album — that's ""Night Air"" and Mirrorwriting, respectively — early this decade before dropping off the face of the planet, and it's a pleasure to have him back. He's a gentle, deft vocalist, and a savvy songwriter to boot. (Mirrorwriting was ahead of its time, coming two years ahead of the subtle, emotive electro-pop wave that swept the UK.) ""Sharpness"" isn't as innovative, but it's grown and sexy and irresistible — the kind of music Robin Thicke would give his left foot to write and sing again. Bring on the Woonaissance! Lianne La Havas, ""Green & Gold"" I can't get enough of Lianne La Havas' second album, Blood — it's personable, placid pop-soul, the sort of thing I'd love to hear from Alicia Keys if she ever manages to rediscover her chill and subtlety again. ""Green & Gold"" is a song about family, about heritage, about searching and finding yourself in the world and people around you. It's like a miniaturized musical origin story, and when I listen to it I feel like I'm meeting someone new — a thoughtful and interesting friend. Martin Courtney, ""Vestiges"" After giving some shine to Courtney's Real Estate bandmate last week, I almost feel obliged to give his debut solo single a moment. It helps that the song is a total joy, languid and suburban and reflective. It might not be a great fit in Build Mode — Ducktails has the Simlish corner on lock, if you recall — but it'll sound lovely on a walk by your old high school while you're visiting your parents. Small Black, ""Boys Life"" Small Black just escaped chillwave's event horizon at the start of the decade, and they've kept on churning out synth-pop and alt-R&B ever since. ""Boys Life"" is my favorite thing they've ever done, colorful and propulsive. I might not remember this song in six months — hey, just being honest! — but it's going to sound great outside during these last few weeks of summer. Titus Andronicus, ""Fired Up"" And if you want something with a little more permanence — something more than a summer trifle — here's Titus Andronicus, burning down the New Jersey Turnpike and leaving destruction in their wake. There's plenty of music worth highlighting on The Most Lamentable Tragedy, which I reviewed last week, but this is the song I can't shake. There's so much detail, intensity, and passion jammed into this thing: Owen Pallett's string arrangement, Patrick Stickles' roaring vocal take, the layers of chanting and chimes and stuff that fuels the song's climax. I always leave it feeling exhausted and inspired, the same way I do when I finish the album as a whole. It'll prepare you for a weekend of revelry, I promise.

I didn’t start watching Breaking Bad until the show had been off the air for a year. You get my point. I don’t particularly want to be made to think, feel, or get outraged by my TV shows.

And when I moved to New York last year, I found my drug. In flipping through my hundreds of Time Warner Cable channels, I discovered NHK World, which is a bit like the Japanese equivalent of BBC America and BBC World Service, rolled into one: a multi-language platform for blasting locally produced news and entertainment programming across the globe. It is wonderful.   I should be clear that I don’t consider myself a Japanophile (though I do think Japan is a lovely country). I don’t watch anime, I don’t read manga. You don’t need to in order to enjoy the simple pleasures of NHK World, which is effectively one long commercial for Japanese tourism interspersed with 10- and 30-minute editions of Newsline, an even-handed, English-language news program devoid of the hyperbole and seizure-inducing chyrons American networks hold dear. There are also dubbed gems imported from NHK proper like Supreme Skills!, where two teams are tasked with building a mundane object taken to the extreme: a top that can spin for 15 minutes, for instance, or a really, really sharp knife blade. You also have Cool Japan, which features a roundtable of foreigners deciding whether various concepts culturally unique to Japan — say, kimonos or cute pencil erasers shaped like sushi rolls — are cool or not. The discussion gets heated at times, inasmuch as a discussion about sushi roll erasers can get heated. Not everything has to be about death, drama, and destruction But peak NHK World can be found on Lunch ON!, a program that is quite literally about eating lunch. No more, no less. Much of it is devoted to camera crews interrupting salarymen to find out what’s in their bento boxes. It’s somehow twee, conceptually small, and endlessly fascinating at the same time. It’s easy to digest, both literally and figuratively. It is impossible to overstate how little you have to think while this program is on, apart from firing the neurons necessary to visually interpret white rice and shrimp tempura. There’s a market for this. There’s a place for not just a single show, but an entire network that can focus on the little things. Not everything has to be about death, drama, and destruction on a grand scale. Yes, there is plenty of that, both in fiction and in the real world — but sometimes, we just need to chill the hell out and talk about skipjack tuna or sumo or the best place to buy headphones in Akihabara.

Love Is Free an ideal late summer release, one with low stakes and high heat; it’s loose, funky, and fecund, pulling from Arthur Russell, Zapp, and Deee-Lite in equal measure. And while I’ll take any excuse to spend 20 minutes hanging with someone as inviting and dynamic as Robyn, I have to make a nerdy confession — I don’t think the music is the most interesting thing about Love Is Free. This is the second straight summer Robyn’s released something hard to define: an EP, a mini-album, a… whatever you want to call it. They’re tight, cohesive statements, but they’re not quite album-length; they’re collaborative, but they’re defined by her presence. In many ways, Do It Again — the mini-album she released last year in tandem with Norwegian electronic duo Röyksopp — is Love Is Free’s opposite: cool where it’s warm, mechanized where it’s organic, preoccupied with scale instead of concision. The music is all enjoyable, but it’s not as intriguing as Robyn’s approach to distribution strategy. She’s playing with form and length unlike any of her contemporaries, even as people across the music industry are experimenting with their own release methods. Everyone’s looking for something, but almost no one is doing it like this.   Robyn’s career began in the most conventional way possible, at least within the pop sphere of the mid-’90s: she worked with Max Martin and other master craftspeople, scoring three international hit singles before she turned 20. (Two of those, ""Do You Know (What It Takes)"" and ""Show Me Love,"" were top 10 hits in the US.) She continued making catchy, smart pop through the turn of the decade, but found herself marginalized by industry politics; albums released in 1999 and 2002 were confined to Europe and Japan. After managing to extricate herself from her label situation, she achieved creative and commercial rebirth with 2005’s Robyn. It was released internationally throughout 2007 and 2008, and it earned her a Grammy nod four years after its initial release. It's been a decade since Robyn has released a conventional LP After that album’s unusual lifespan ended, something changed. She started to diverge from the timelines typically associated with recording, release, and promotion. 2010 was the year of Body Talk: she put out three separate collections of music in six months. Two of them sat on the line between album and something less, covering eight tracks each in just about 30 minutes; a third was an EP-length blast topping off a compilation of her best work throughout the year. That burst of activity was followed by four years of relative silence, during which she coasted on tremendous goodwill. Do It Again landed in 2014, and Love Is Free is on your local streaming service’s doorstep right now. If you’ve been following along, that means it’s been a decade since Robyn’s released a conventional LP or opted into a recognizable album cycle.   This kind of strategy wouldn’t have been as viable before the advent of music’s digital age. We associate EPs with a measure of length, but they had a physical connotation once — they were tangibly different than singles and albums, existing as a midpoint between the two. When physical formats began to diversify in the 1970s and ‘80s, release forms proliferated too — and when the digital revolution took hold in the late ‘90s and early ‘00s, it relegated EPs and their ilk to the province they currently inhabit. They’re classifications that have to do with time rather than physical products. Physical releases are anachronisms, artifacts, and luxury items That same digital revolution — the one that began with Napster and led to iTunes, what.cd, and your streaming service of choice — has made it much easier for artists to experiment with form, though fewer people are taking advantage than you’d think. In an era where physical releases are anachronisms, artifacts, or luxury items, there’s nothing pressuring artists into recording and releasing full-length albums. You don’t necessarily have to carve out time at a pressing plant, or pay for the packaging of your music; plop whatever you’ve got onto an online store and call it a day. Perhaps it’s fondness for the idea of the album that’s leading most artists to play with the element of surprise and varying lead times — that’s the surprise album, undoubtedly familiar whether you’re stanning for David Bowie or Beyoncé. Some people have played with interstitial single releases, strings culminating or building up to album-length releases. Kanye West stoked the flames of hype for 2010’s My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy with his GOOD Friday series; Justin Bieber did the same thing with his Music Mondays, releasing tracks that made up 2013’s Journals. Others have embraced EPs as a means of getting ready for a full-length debut — a good recent example is the British producer James Blake, who won ears with The Bells Sketch, Klavierwerke, and CMYK in 2010 before releasing an eponymous LP in 2011. Even the hip-hop and electronic artists who work predominantly through mixtapes find themselves beholden to the album’s form. Atlantan rapper Future has released a dozen mixtapes and only three studio albums, but you'd be hard-pressed to classify them by listening to them or staring at their tracklists.   There are precious few examples of artists who rely on EPs and / or mini-albums as their primary form of release, and they’re working on the periphery of the North American music industry for one reason or another. The enigmatic, influential British producer Burial hasn’t released a full-length since 2007’s landmark Untrue, opting instead for a series of four celebrated EPs and lengthy singles: Street Halo, Kindred, Truant / Rough Sleeper, and Rival Dealer. And mini-albums are more prevalent in the world of K-pop, where even the genre’s most popular artists release them at the same rate as studio albums (and in a few different languages to boot). But Burial’s music is resolute in its anti-commerciality, and Korean stars have had a hard time breaking into the North American market despite their impeccable songcraft and charisma. That leaves Robyn as a standard-bearer for those eschewing full-lengths, a minor pop star with an international fan base and a hold on American clubs when she deigns to release new material. When music is limitless, brevity becomes even more appealing Why does this strategy appeal to her? And why does she have the freedom to eschew years of tradition and the prestige people still associate with long-form statements? The expectations placed on EPs and other ""non-album"" releases aren’t as high, and releasing smaller packets of music can function like opening a pressure release valve every summer. You’re never fully sating people’s thirst, but you’re giving them enough to get by. You can fully explore one or two key ideas without feeling like you have to spread them thin over an entire album, and you can cherry-pick your best bits of songwriting and turns of phrase. And when your listeners have access to a virtually limitless library of other music which they can access with remarkable speed, brevity starts to become even more appealing. Give Robyn five tracks' worth of time — half an hour, tops — and she'll give you a cohesive, exciting glimpse into her mind. Finally, this break from tradition — this embrace of freedom — makes complete sense for Robyn gives the values she’s espoused over her two-decade career. She had to fight for independence, and she won it: full creative control, her own record label subsidiary, and a track record of success on her terms. She has the flexibility to put out music however she wants because she’s working with a laundry list of international hits, adoration from both fans and critics, and freedom from an oppressive contract or some clueless exec’s demands (though Konichiwa Records is an imprint of Interscope, a much larger label). Love Is Free isn’t going to light up the charts — Do It Again peaked within the top 15 in the US before tailing off — but its sales are beyond the point. And though she could yet return to the world of full-lengths — in a June interview with Fact, she said, ""I’m gonna make another album.

They'll travel through time, hanging out with famous historical figures — and they'll host a variety show from a Manhattan penthouse, apparently. In a way, the characters themselves have traveled through time: they made their TV debut almost half a century ago, appearing in their own segments as part of The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show. This isn't the first recent revival of Mr. Peabody and Sherman. DreamWorks Animation released a full-length animated feature starring the characters last year, Mr. Peabody & Sherman, but it tanked at the box office despite decent reviews. The film's failure obviously wasn't enough to dissuade the studio from doing more with the property, as it's producing the series for Netflix. There's a track record of good quality behind the series, too: executive producer Dave Smith cut his teeth working at Cartoon Network, putting together shows like Steven's Universe and Dexter's Laboratory.

A round watch in a sea of squares, the 360 looked great and became the poster child for Android Wear. But it wasn't without issues: namely its large size, disappointing battery life, and odd design details (such as those pesky internal strap mounts). Just about a year later, Motorola is taking the wraps off of its second-generation Moto 360. This time around, one size doesn't fit all. The new Moto 360 is actually three distinct smartwatches: a men's version in two sizes, a women's version, and a dedicated sport version, complete with on-board GPS and outdoor-readable display. Motorola is now calling its smartwatch offerings a ""collection,"" a term borrowed from the fashion world that feels apt here. Like the first Moto 360, buyers will be able to customize the appearance and finishes of their watches, and this year Motorola says it has over 300 possible combinations of looks with bands, colors, bezels, and sizes all in the mix. The men's and women's Moto 360s are available for preorder from Motorola's website starting today and will begin shipping in a couple of weeks, while the Moto 360 Sport will be available later this year. Pricing for the new Moto 360s ranges from $299.99 to $429.99, a premium over last year's watch, and the company isn't yet saying how much the Moto 360 Sport will cost. For the men's and women's 360s, Motorola is still using a round watch design, though it's made some small, yet significant changes. The men's version comes in 46mm (same size as last year) and 42mm versions, while the women's version is available with a 42mm face and narrower, 16mm strap mounts. The strap mounts on both versions are now standard lugs fused to the outside of the watches, which make it easier to swap bands and give the watches a more traditional and flattering look. (Motorola's bands also include quick release pins, even in the metal link bracelets, for quick strap changes.) The smaller size versions should make the new Moto 360 more appealing to those that were put off by the rather large size of the original. Other details include a slight repositioning of the button to the 2 o'clock position and the ability to customize the finish of the small bezel that surrounds the display. The men's version will be available in silver, gold, and black, while the women's version can be optioned with silver, gold, or a new rose gold color. The women's version is also available with a few new strap options, including a leather double wrap. Motorola has kept the overall shape of the display the same, including the ""flat tire"" at the 6 o'clock position. The company insists that this design allows it to have the highest screen-to-case ratio of any smartwatch, and customer research showed that most buyers do not find it to be an issue. (The flat spot is also where Motorola puts the ambient light sensor that enables automatic brightness adjustments, something that many other smartwatches do not offer.) The display itself is slightly higher in resolution than last year, but it's still an LCD and not the OLED of other watches. It's improved, but still doesn't look as nice as the screens on the Apple Watch or LG Watch Urbane. The new Moto 360s also have upgraded internals, such as a Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 processor. Performance and battery life should be improved thanks to the new chip, and Motorola says the 46mm watch will last up to two days between charges, while the 42mm watch will be able to last about a day and a half. That's about double what we've seen with the first-generation Moto 360. Charging is still done through a wireless dock, which comes with the purchase of the watch. The Moto 360 Sport is unique from the other versions in that it has a fixed silicone strap and special LCD display that can be read in direct sunlight. It's based on the 42mm size watch, though it's chunkier than the standard model. The Sport can track distance and map runs with its dedicated GPS chip. For software, the watches are running the latest version of Android Wear, and they are compatible with both iOS and Android. Motorola is including a couple of new watch faces that have ""Live Dials,"" which are the company's version of interactive complications. The dials can be set to display weather conditions (with more info available with a tap), step count, battery levels, or app shortcuts. At launch, Live Dials can be set to open Shazam, Kevo, IFTTT, and the Ford app, and Motorola says it's making it possible for other developers to create Live Dials, as well. Motorola's first Android Wear effort was a step ahead of the rest of the field, but not without its problems. This year, Motorola has focused on addressing those specific problems, and if things like battery life and performance pan out the way Motorola says they will, it should be a much better device than before. The added ability to customize not only the color of the watch but also the size should make the new models appeal to many more people. The fact that they'll also work with the iPhone now will obviously help there, too. But in the intervening time since Motorola launched its last watch, the smartwatch world has changed dramatically, with Apple entering the fray and many other companies stepping up their game. Samsung is expected to announced a wholly new Gear smartwatch soon that uses a lot of the design concepts set forth by the 360 (as in, it's round). It remains to be seen whether or not Motorola's focus on personalization and customizability will make the new 360 a winner in the still nascent smartwatch market, but we're definitely eager to spend more time with this one.",0.7046752979542333,0.29532470204576666,0.19649103469890658,999,4.7887887887887892,472,5.9110169491525424,0,62,"Google, Mobile, Tech, Hands-on"

In among all this extravagance, however, there's one company that's still retaining a bit of sobriety and approaching IFA in a professional manner. Yes, I speak of Sony. The Japanese company's presentation left me feeling a bit flat, probably because its phones all leaked well in advance of the show, but getting them in my hands has revitalized my spirits and rekindled my anticipation. These new Xperia Z5 phones are nice. The subtle matte finish on the back, the elegant colors, the lightning-fast fingerprint sensor. Everything about this design evokes a sense of maturity and thoughtfulness. Okay, so the chromed-out Xperia Z5 Premium doesn't quite fit in the same mold of understated classiness, but hey, Sony needs to sell phones and all of its other ideas aren't working out, so why not put a mirror on the back? I'm also unconvinced that any smartphone will ever need a full 4K display resolution — which is the Z5 Premium's highlight spec — but there's no denying that the screens on all three of these phones look great. Sony's got a color-matched theme for every hue in the Z5 series, which just helps highlight the displays' good contrast. The story of the Z5 is a familiar one, insofar as Sony has kept to its strategy of gradual evolution and refinement, but I definitely like all the little tweaks it has made, including the blockier shape, in this new generation. The biggest promise, though, comes from that new 23-megapixel camera sensor, which Sony says is the best it's ever made for a phone. Better than even the ones it makes for Apple's iPhones, presumably. Of course, camera performance is the sum of many things, including the lens and image processing, but if Sony can live up to its words, the Xperia Z5s are going to be a great addition to the cohort of awesome Android phones.

Google's seen a lot of changes recently, and the latest came yesterday, when the tech company surprised everyone with their new logo. In one of the biggest changes since 1999, Google's new logo uses a simpler sans-serif typeface. The new logo had to work well in constrained spaces and maintain consistency across many products, the company explained in a blog post. Many iterations of the new logo ended up on the cutting room floor. So how did Google do? We picked the brains of some graphic and type designers to see what they thought.   ""They've chosen to emphasize every circle they could find, which is an effective way to create a friendly and approachable impression. But that makes the ‘l' stand out a bit awkwardly, being the only entirely straight shape. Being the only green letter doesn't help either, so it's tempting to parse this as 'Googe.' But they did well to retain this distinctive sequence of colors — they were the only way I could 'glance' this as being Google. I don't think this redesign speaks to any larger trend, because clean simplicity will always succeed, even if it doesn't excite. But I really hope this ‘e' does not become a thing."" — Tobias Frere-Jones, type designer at Frere-Jones Type ""Goo / Holds the World together."" ""I would change the name to Goo.

The changes, which include integrated search and voice typing for Google Docs, will begin rolling out today. The biggest changes are coming to Google Docs, and they'll likely make your life easier whether you're a student or you've long since graduated. To start with, Google is rolling out dictation in 40 languages, building on its years of developing voice-recognition technology across its product lineup. Unlike most dictation software on the market, Google's ""voice typing"" doesn't require you to train it by speaking a bunch of practice sentences. You just tap and start talking, and it works on Docs for Android, iOS, and the web. Just tap and start talking The second big update to Docs is Android-only, at least for now: integrated search, which is available in the app's ""Research"" tool. Google Docs already has a research tool on the web, but searches kick you out of Docs into a new tab. The new tool opens up a split window that lets you search for text or images; when you see something you want to save, you can tap a new ""insert"" button and add it to your document. I assume a version of the feature will eventually come to the web and iOS, but Google declined to comment.  The final update to Docs lets you see all new changes to a document since the last time you opened it. Just click the ""see new changes"" button and they'll be highlighted on the page. If you're working on a document with multiple people, their changes will be highlighted in different colors; hover over the change and you'll see the name of the person who made it. Google Docs still has a full version history, but this makes it easier to quickly scan a document to see what's new. Other updates to Google's productivity suite include a range of new templates for Docs, Sheets, and Slides; a refreshed user interface for Forms; and a new ""explore"" feature in Sheets that attempts to create useful charts automatically out of the data in the spreadsheet. Google is also rolling out a Chrome extension that lets teachers share web pages to every student in their classroom with a couple of clicks.

It's been approved for a range of potential conditions; in New York, for example, it can be sought by sufferers of Parkinson's, HIV/AIDS, epilepsy, and multiple sclerosis. Particularly in the United States, though, legal restrictions and limited funding have made it hard to test its actual efficacy. In a study published today by the journal Neurology, researchers from the Netherlands say that patients with Alzheimer's or other forms of dementia might want to look beyond pot... at least for the time being. Early studies in mice and humans have suggested that THC (naturally found in marijuana) could help alleviate some symptoms that accompany dementia, including agitation and motor control problems. Study co-author Marcel Olde Rikkert, a geriatrics researcher from Radboud Univerity Medical Centre, says that these were either too small or not well-controlled enough to definitively show a benefit, but they were enough to warrant a more detailed study, especially because current treatments like antipsychotics can have dangerous side effects for aging patients. The placebo group showed about as much improvement The team recruited 50 patients with dementia and without other severe illnesses, putting 26 on a placebo and 24 on 4.5 milligrams of THC (in pill form) daily. The study was double-blinded, so neither the researchers nor the patients knew which group was which. At the beginning, the patients' caregivers scored their levels of symptoms like agitation and aggression. After two and three weeks, they repeated the survey, letting researchers compare the scores. The researchers noted that scores for patients using THC improved over the course of the study. Unfortunately, so did the placebo recipients — there was no statistically significant difference between the groups. Patients weren't getting as high a dose of THC as someone smoking recreationally or taking it for other medical purposes, but Olde Rikkert says it was comparable to previous studies about dementia. ""We suggest that former results were biased by not being strictly blinded or otherwise biased,"" he says. This doesn't mean that it's time to give up on testing THC for dementia sufferers. The drug was tolerated well, says Olde Rikkert, making it potentially safe to try in higher doses that could have real effects. ""There were no side effects, no ‘high’ feelings, and with very sensitive gait and balance measures we could only find minor changes."" It also doesn't tell us much about the potential benefits in other areas, like multiple sclerosis pain — which Olde Rikkert cites as a better-researched example — and epilepsy. But it does show that despite the broad potential of medical marijuana, we're still in the early stages of figuring out how to use it.",0.3840602765364449,0.6159397234635551,0.20483316387685113,464,5.3038793103448274,300,6.1833333333333336,0,0,Science

The statistics come from a broad, national look at who is being diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in the US. The study, which comes from the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics, doesn't say why these disparities in diagnosis exist, but the reasonable implication is that some children may not be receiving a diagnosis when they should be, potentially leaving them without care.  ""There may be some barriers that relate to the likelihood of receiving a diagnosis."" The differences that the researchers found cover age, sex, race, insurance status, and economic situation. Among the more striking findings are those on race and insurance. For race, 11.5 percent of non-Hispanic white children were found to have ever been diagnosed with ADHD; 8.9 percent of non-Hispanic black children had; and 6.3 percent of Hispanic children had. When it came to insurance, the study found that more children with public or private insurance had received an ADHD diagnosis, at 11.7 percent and 8.6 percent respectively, than children without insurance, just 5.7 percent of whom had been diagnosed. As of 2011, 6.4 million school-aged children were reported by their parents to have ever been diagnosed with ADHD, a prior CDC study found. The newly released NCHS study adds that, in total, 9.5 percent of children between the ages of 4 and 17 are reported to have ever been diagnosed with ADHD.   The trouble with just looking at statistics is that, while the disparities in diagnosis become very obvious, it isn't necessarily clear what they mean. Are people without insurance just less likely to have ADHD? That's probably not what's going on — and it'll be up to further studies to determine what's occurring. ""There are kids out there who aren't diagnosed with ADHD who may actually have this condition, and they don't have access to care or their parents have chosen not to take them in to be diagnosed,"" Patricia Pastor, the study's lead author and an NCHS researcher, tells The Verge. ""None of those issues can be covered by this study."" The study is based on data collected in the National Health Interview Survey between 2011 and 2013. It was conducted using interviews, meaning parents are relied upon to provide answers about whether or not their children have been diagnosed with ADHD, a behavioral disorder that can lead to children having difficulty staying focused, paying attention, or controlling their behavior. In addition to its findings on race and insurance status, it also found that more than twice as many boys have received an ADHD diagnosis than girls, that more children are diagnosed in families farther from the poverty line, and that more adolescents are diagnosed than young children. If children aren't being properly diagnosed, they can't receive treatment ""I think their findings suggest that there may be some barriers that relate to the likelihood of receiving a diagnosis,"" Paul Morgan, an associate professor of education at Penn State who has done prior research on ADHD diagnosis, but was not involved in this study, tells The Verge. Barriers to diagnosis, he says, seem to be a more likely answer to explaining why these disparities exist. In fact, prior research already points to some of these. Studies have shown that children from minority groups are more likely to display symptoms of ADHD, Morgan says. Studies have also shown that these children are exposed to more risk factors of ADHD, too. There could be a number of reasons why they aren't diagnosed, he says, including parents trying to avoid a stigmatized label within their community, pediatricians being less likely to evaluate certain children for the condition, or even language barriers at the doctor's office. ""It's a serious issue that there should be disparities in ADHD diagnosis."" ""There's probably a combination of factors at work,"" Morgan says. ""The problem is if children who are, say, black or don't have access to health insurance aren't identified, it's increasing the likelihood they're experiencing a number of different negative outcomes, including struggles in school."" Of course, ADHD diagnosis is also controversial, with some experts viewing its prevalence as a sign of over-diagnosis. (This study's figure for total children diagnosed — 9.5 percent — is lower than the CDC's previous figure, that 11 percent of all kids aged 4 to 17 had received an ADHD diagnosis by 2011; however, the two studies are based on different parent-reported surveys.) There's also potential for misdiagnosis. As The Atlantic reported last year, signs of trauma can be mistaken for ADHD. The NCHS makes a point of not commenting on policy issues, so it doesn't have much to say about what we're looking at. But the information it's presenting gives researchers important new data for researching ADHD. ""It's a serious issue that there should be disparities in ADHD diagnosis, that it should essentially matter what your family's characteristics are or your own characters are should matter in terms of access to treatment for a disorder you may have,"" Morgan says. ""I think that's a serious issue. It's public health issue. And a better understanding of the mechanisms that are responsible for the observed disparities is an important next step for the field.""",0.40531413217649614,0.5946858678235039,0.2921875257324197,890,5.1359550561797755,408,6.125,0,2,Science

Ebola, like HIV and influenza, belongs to a class of virus with a high rate of mutation, and scientists had previously warned that it might evolve to become more contagious and, in an extreme scenario, even airborne. This latest report published in Nature corroborates an earlier study from March, showing that while the virus did mutate as it spread to new areas, it did so within the bounds of expected behavior. Early analyses had suggested that the virus might be evolving at twice the usual rate. The new findings, however, don't make the outbreak itself any less serious — the Nature report states that more than 10,000 individuals are thought to have been killed by the virus, while an additional 25,000 have been infected. ""This is just the virus doing what it does."" The scientists involved in the study, led by epidemiologist Wu-Chun Cao, sequenced 175 virus genomes collected last year in Sierra Leone. The samples were collected between September 28th and November 11th, and in total, were found to contain some 440 new mutations, with most of these occurring in the part of the gene that instructs the virus how to attach itself to human cells. Scientists say that this means it's possible that the virus' evolution was driven by the human immune system, although this pattern of mutation might also simply be down to chance.

In a new study, published today in Evolution, researchers describe the process that appears to make birds have a beak instead of a dinosaur's snout. They put that process to the test in an attempt to reverse their evolution, ultimately creating chicken embryos that appeared to develop features akin to a snout. The study was led from researchers at Harvard and Yale.  Researchers say their goal isn't ""to create a 'dino-chicken' simply for the sake of it."" ""Our goal here was to understand the molecular underpinnings of an important evolutionary transition, not to create a 'dino-chicken' simply for the sake of it,"" lead author Bhart-Anjan Bhullar, a developmental biologist at Yale, says in a statement that will likely be inspiration for dialogue in Jurassic World 2. The researchers honed in on two proteins developed on a bird's face. In an embryo, the proteins are created differently in birds than in reptiles, which they're related to. Rather than being created from a single patch of cells, the proteins are instead created from two smaller patches, The New York Times reports. The researchers were interested in seeing if a bird's beak would go back to something a bit more like a dinosaur's snout if it had two patches, rather than one. To test that, the researchers inserted a bead that had been soaked with inhibitors into the face of the embryo. This could lead to cell death, though the researchers say that didn't happen. Instead, it appeared to make the embryos develop more like their ancestors did, showing snout-like features and bone changes. ""This was unexpected and demonstrates the way in which a single, simple developmental mechanism can have wide-ranging and unexpected effects,"" Bhullar says. Outside experts who the Times spoke with remained skeptical of the study. In part, that's because it still doesn't identify the genetic root of the change from snout to beak — they only know how those genes are expressed. Still, Bhullar sees this as a worthwhile area of study. Despite being a crucial and diverse element of modern birds, ""little work has been done on what exactly a beak is, anatomically, and how it got that way either evolutionarily or developmentally,"" he says. Don't expect to see these experiments being used to create dino-birds for your entertainment, however. The BBC reports that, while Bhullar believes the modified chicken embryos would survive ""just fine,"" he has no plans to hatch them.

The two-meter-long creature is fun to look at, and maybe laugh at, but it's got a lot more to share with you than its looks. As it turns out, it's the only ""truly warm-blooded fish,"" according to National Geographic — and it's pretty fast, to boot. Usually, a fish's overall temperature matches the water it's in Usually, a fish's overall temperature matches the water it's in. There are some exceptions — some fish can heat parts of their bodies — but the rule holds true if you're looking at a fish's entire body. Fish generally don't have the ability to warm their hearts, or their brains. But the thing is, the opah does. Its whole body is usually about five degrees Celsius warmer than the water it's swimming in.     Credit: NOAA Fisheries, Southwest Fisheries Science Center The discovery, published today in Science, was an accident. Nicholas Wegner, a biologist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, told National Geographic that his team caught some opah during a research trip, and subsequently decided to find out more about the species. During a dissection, Wegner noticed that the gills were sporting the same kind of blue and red blood vessels, called retia mirabilia, that tuna and sharks use to heat parts of their bodies. Except that unlike sharks and tuna, the opah's red and blue blood vessels were located inside the gills, rather than in the fish's swimming muscles. The cold blood stays mainly in the gills The finding means that when the opah flaps its pectoral fins to generate heat, warm blood gets to travel through the entire body before being cooled by water in the gills. When that happens, the cold blood in the gills — blood that's now also oxygen-rich because of the exchange with water — gets heated by oxygen-depleted, warm blood coming from the body. Thus, cold blood never gets to exit the gills. As Ed Yong puts it, the opah seems to have flipped the conventional arrangement by isolating the cold part of its body, its gills, from the warmer regions — regions like its brain, its muscles, and its heart. No other fish warms its own heart. This is a pretty big deal, but the opah had more surprises in store for Wegner and his team. Because of its size and shape, they assumed that the disc-like creature was a slow swimmer. They were wrong. By tagging some of these fish, the researchers learned that they migrate thousands of kilometers.

Problem is, the company is doing it by launching a $50,000 crowdfunding campaign on its own website prior to filing for the necessary FDA clearance. The move could doom the product before it ever hits the market — or it could point to a glaring loophole in FDA regulations. If funding a product in anticipation of receiving said product doesn't count as a purchase, then the field of medical device regulation is about to get really messy. ""Sounds pretty illegal to me."" ""Sounds pretty illegal to me,"" says Diana Zuckerman, president of the National Center for Health Research, a nonprofit that analyzes medical treatments in order to see how safe and effective they are. ""Even if there is some sort of a loophole for crowdfunding of an advanced purchase of an unapproved product, it certainly sounds like it’s a sale — they're saying it's '50 percent off for 30 days' — and they can’t sell it if it’s not approved.""  Cur (pronounced ""cure"") is a transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation machine — or a TENS machine — that backers can obtain by funding the campaign to the tune of $149. These medical devices use electrical currents to stimulate nerves and muscles in order to relieve pain. They're especially popular with physical therapists who use them for pain management, despite the fact that the data on the effectiveness of TENS machines is sorely lacking. (In fact, the American Academy of Neurology gave them a big thumbs down for treating chronic back pain in 2009.) But Cur is different from other TENS machines, which often come in the form of a large box with a bunch of dials and wires. For one thing, Cur is completely wireless and regulates itself thanks to sensors that include an accelerometer. Cur is also very small, and can be easily concealed under clothing. This means that a user can wear it at work or during a run without asking for help from a professional, says Cur founder Shaun Rahimi, a biomedical engineer who has worked for companies like Abbott Laboratories and NeuroPace. ""Within 5 seconds, it measures your muscle responses, [meaning] how your muscles are twitching in response to the current that's delivered,"" he says. ""So you put this on, you don't even have to press a button. It’s attached, it starts, it detects how strong it is [compared with] where it should be using the muscle twitches, and then it sets the level that way."" A company can’t promote or advertise a medical device prior to FDA clearance If it works the way Rahimi says it does, Cur could be extremely popular with chronic pain sufferers. But launching a crowdfunding campaign before receiving FDA clearance for the device is a risky move. After all, the FDA forbids marketing directly to consumers for unapproved medical products. And when crowdfunding functions as a pre-order system, campaigns that sport slick videos and slogans look a lot like marketing.   Credit: Cur Cur hasn't filed for clearance yet The ""FDA regulates pre-approval or pre-clearance promotional activities for medical devices,"" says Ellen Flannery, a lawyer and partner at Covington & Burling LLP who specializes in developing strategic plans for obtaining FDA marketing clearance. A device that lacks marketing clearance is considered ""investigational,"" and a company can’t promote, advertise, or accept orders for a medical device prior to getting FDA clearance, she says. The regulatory agency ""considers such activities to be ‘commercialization' of the unapproved device."" And although the FDA makes exceptions for trade shows, those exceptions only apply after a company has filed for clearance — a step that Cur has yet to take. ""We are close to submitting the package [to the FDA], but we’re still a few months away,"" Rahimi says. TENS devices have been been around for a long time. They're ""50 times over approved,"" which means that Cur doesn't have to go through a whole bunch of human testing to gain clearance, Rahimi explains. The company just has to make sure that their validation tests demonstrate that Cur is similar to existing TENS devices and file for ""substantial equivalence."" ""We'll file for the [substantial equivalence] in August, and assuming that three- to four-month pathway continues, that means winter we'll be shipping the product to our early backers on crowdfunding,"" he says. Cur plans to ship the product after their TENS device gets cleared by the FDA. The website was customized to ""speak to the consumer."" Rahimi explains that the campaign ""isn't a pre-order at all."" But when he describes what he's doing, it sounds a lot like Cur is marketing directly to consumers. For instance, he says that one of the reasons Cur decided to forgo launching a campaign on well-known crowdfunding websites Kickstarter and Indiegogo is because the Cur website can be customized to ""speak to the consumer in a more direct way, with visuals — it's a prettier website."" He also admits that he launched the campaign to find out more about Cur's customers. ""I think if I have a crowdfunding campaign that shows a little more data about the demand for the product… I think that gives me a lot more leverage with the [venture capital],"" he says. Backing Cur's campaign means ""contributing"" to the company's efforts rather than buying a product, according to the button at the bottom of the order form. For companies like Cur, crowdfunding isn't a ""contract of sale"" because these orders sometimes go unfulfilled. And that's the idea that could make enforcing the FDA's rules against taking orders for unapproved medical products difficult. Regardless of whether a product is safe or effective, you're making a ""donation"" that comes with ""a reward"" at the end of a certain period. Indeed, Cur's website includes language designed to protect the website from looking like a pre-ordering system: By making a contribution on or after May 13, 2015 you acknowledge and agree that you are contributing (i.e., making a donation) to a work in progress and not making a direct purchase. Your reward is the number of Cur Devices you contribute towards. But Rahimi's own statements suggest that Cur's campaign violates certain FDA rules. For example, he told The Verge that the product is finished, which means that the campaign isn't going to fund research. ""The product's done. We made sure to have that happen before we started the crowdfunding campaign,"" he says. But the FDA clearly states that a company that has filed for substantial equivalence can't ""take orders, or be prepared to take orders"" that could result in ""contracts of sale for the device"" unless those sales have to do with with research or investigational use.   Looking at the Cur website without thinking that the company is selling a product is pretty hard; you can see the words ""get Cur now"" right at the top. ""What I find fascinating is that nothing about this [campaign] says that you're donating money until you get to this crowdfunding [page],"" Zuckerman says. This is the ultimate of 'don’t forget to read the fine print' — everything else about this suggests that you're buying a product."" The website does state that the product has yet to receive FDA clearance thanks to statements like ""ships Winter 2015, after FDA approval"" below the price tag. But finding out what that means isn't easy. The FAQs on Cur’s website offered no information about the process surrounding the product's FDA clearance at the time of publication. Backing Cur's campaign means ""contributing"" to Cur's efforts It's hard not to wonder why the Cur team couldn't wait a few months to get FDA clearance. When asked, Rahimi explained that the money is necessary to get through the FDA regulatory process. ""Right now we have enough money to get through all these processes, but it just helps us move faster,"" he said. ""The money is useful now in terms of building the company. And the FDA processes are not inexpensive."" For most startups, this explanation could be considered reasonable. But when dealing with people's health, ""going fast"" isn't always ideal. How the FDA will respond to this campaign is unclear; the agency declined to comment on this story. It's still possible that a crowdfunding campaign that targets consumers will be interpreted as ""investigational use"" geared toward a large, and extremely diverse number of ""investors."" But scrolling through Cur's website suggests a far murkier outcome. ""It’s a pre-order for something that they may never be able to sell,"" Zuckerman says. ""And to me, it's hard to feel confident about the integrity of the product given the lack of integrity of the website. If they have a legitimate product, then the company shouldn't be selling it this way."" Update May 14th, 7:39PM ET: Following the publication of this report, Cur reached out to The Verge to let us know that they changed their website.

While the numbers have declined in the last few decades, World Bank estimates show that about 1.3 billion people worldwide make less than $1.25 a day. While there's no magic bullet, a new study published in Science demonstrates that an all-of-the-above approach to poverty that involves everything from income to health care can improve the quality of life of the world's poorest. The study, conducted by the research and policy non-profit Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA) and the Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab (J-PAL) at MIT, examines a method known as a the ""Graduation model,"" first developed by BRAC, a large non-governmental development organization (NGO) based in Bangladesh, in 2002, and later refined by the Consultive Group to Assist the Poor (CGAP) and the Ford Foundation in 2006. Currently, the model calls for governments or aid groups to intervene in the lives of poor families in six key ways: providing assets like livestock or goods that can be used to make a living; offering training on how to manage those assets; offering food and cash support to help avoid emergencies; making frequent visits to reinforce skills; giving health education and access to health care; and providing a savings account for future investment. Where previous efforts only focused on a few components, addressing all six simultaneously could not only improve the family's income, but also its sense of well-being. In other words, think of the model as a ""big push"" for families to gradually and sustainably lift themselves out of hardship. A big push for families to lift themselves out of hardship The researchers at IPA and J-PAL tracked more than 21,000 people in six countries — Honduras, Peru, Ghana, Ethiopia, India, and Pakistan — between 2007 and 2014 in order to determine the efficacy of the Graduation model. In a series of randomized control trials, some families were invited into an initial two-year program while others were not, and the team compared how the families' lives had changed by the end of the third year. The group found that the method had lasting positive effects in five of the six countries. Families in India, for instance, saw a 433 percent return on investment, meaning that for every dollar that was spent launching the program there, the families made, on average, $4.33 back for themselves. Those benefits persisted even three years after the end of the study.   ""There’s nothing new about the Graduation model’s components,"" study co-author Dean Karlan of Yale University and IPA told The Verge. ""Each of these components has been done before. What is new is doing them all together. So you have a lesson for countries to build this into their social protection program. It’s a viable program that’s a good way of improving existing efforts of alleviating poverty."" That doesn't mean the approach is foolproof. In Honduras, the Graduation model actually saw a -198 percent return on investment because the chickens families were given to raise died off. That failure illustrates the importance of choosing the right asset to launching programs in specific countries. Environmental factors like disease, along with cultural and economic ones, can affect the outcome of any initiative. Ultimately, the onus is on the researchers to continue the study into the future. ""Even Messi has to practice!"" ""We’re never going to get to some point where we declare this is the perfect model forever and ever,"" said Karlan. ""It’s important for any program to take up a learning attitude about how they run the program, to continuously learn how to refine and how to improve and how to adapt to new conditions, markets, and cultural changes. Even Messi has to practice!"" Nevertheless, the Graduation model is already being used to address extreme poverty in Bangladesh, and Ethiopia is now in the process of expanding its own safety net program to incorporate the model going forward. In 2013, World Bank president Jim Yong Kim spoke at Georgetown University to outline an agenda for ending extreme poverty by 2030, saying that it's imperative to boost the incomes of the poorest 40 percent in developing and conflict-affected countries. The researchers in today's study hope that their findings prove that the Graduation method is a scalable solution to global poverty that can be implemented by governments and aid groups immediately. It's too soon to tell if every ultra-poor family can be helped in 15 years, but the study provides a framework that may make Kim's goal a reality.",0.7170457151355744,0.28295428486442564,0.8522890572797658,755,5.1019867549668874,434,6.2488479262672811,0,2,"Science, US & World, Report"

I can't blame him: it's such a distinctive car in a weirdly underserved part of the exotic car market that it's instantly desirable. The 570S slots in beneath McLaren's 650S, and will retail for under $200,000. That means it competes with the very highest-end Porsche 911s and relatively little else. It might get a little competition from the Acura NSX when it hits streets in the coming months. I can't believe I'm saying this, but it's kind of cheap for what it is. The 570S employs a twin-turbo V-8 good for 562hp and a top speed just north of 200 miles per hour. Being a member of the 200 mph club doesn't mean quite as much as it used to, but it's still a nice badge to have under your belt. While the exterior might be a little polarizing — I personally love it — it's hard to argue with the interior. McLaren seems to be getting the hang of sumptuous, sporty interiors as it dives into more and more models. The 570S has a center-mounted touchscreen with an array of displays in the instrument cluster; physical controls below the touchscreen and between the seats mean you don't need to fumble around with a touch UI for each and every function. Two 570S variants are on display here at the New York auto show, one in McLaren's signature orange and another more understated model in medium gray with buckskin interior. I'd take either one.

It knows no bounds. It is an unstoppable, almost supernatural force that has led me to marathon the entire six-movie set more times than I can count. For God’s sake, I co-host a dedicated Fast & Furious podcast. And here’s the thing: I don’t think I’m alone. Granted, my obsession may run a little deeper than it does for most, but the progenitor of this series is now 14 years old; today, there are teenagers who have quite literally grown up with Dom, Brian, and the gang. Obviously, at its most basic level, each new Fast film is a high-budget ode to street racing and explosions — but this has also now become a telenovela for the movie-going set. Once every year or two, we check in on the Torettos, the O’Conners, and their perfect little slice of LA. We want to know how they’re doing. Mia’s baby must be getting big now! The downside to this kind of mad devotion to Vin Diesel’s kingdom of steel and testosterone, of course, is that disappointment is a substantial and ever-present risk. And never has anticipation for a Fast & Furious film been greater — both for me personally and for the movie-going population at large — than it has ahead of the release of Furious 7. There’s certainly some morbid fascination around the tragic mid-filming death of Paul Walker and how his central character of Brian O’Conner would be handled, but there’s also the simple reality that this is a Fast & Furious joint. They always get bigger, crazier, more deliciously absurd. Considering the precedents set by Fast Five and Fast & Furious 6, it’s a tough benchmark to beat. The bigger they are, the harder they fall.   Furious 7 picks up after the events of Tokyo Drift, tracking the crew’s search for vengeance after the death of one of their own — Han — at the hands of Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham). Deckard, in turn, is the brother of Fast 6’s fallen bad guy Owen Shaw. Basically, everyone wants to kill everyone else. No one would've pegged the making of Furious 7 as an easy task But it’s a mess from the start. Clearly, no one would’ve pegged the making of Furious 7 as an easy task after Walker’s death, and there was also a delicate dance needed to untangle the series’ 1-2-4-5-6-3-7 chronology. Indeed, there are moments where director James Wan — a newcomer to the franchise whose prior credits are almost exclusively horror films — seems to have been palpably buried by the enormity of the task that lie before him. The entire first third of the movie almost continuously trips over itself, as Wan and the writers seemed hell-bent on setting up (and, in some cases, glossing over) a laundry list of relatively minor plot points and callbacks, perhaps in an overwrought attempt to tie off storylines haphazardly and with minimal effort — and to satisfy fanatics like me. We go on a whirlwind tour of moments in Fast lore past and present, visiting (the still unfortunately named) Race Wars for a fleeting instant and the streets of Tokyo Drift for another. It’s as if Wan’s mission was to treat every character and every scene from previous films as a touchstone to be collected in Furious 7’s vast satchel.   The grab bag of bit characters includes Hector, Elena, Twinkie, Sean, and even Owen Shaw, none of whom really contribute anything — they’re just there. (Hector’s only purpose, for instance, is to be punched by Michelle Rodriguez’s Letty.) And if none of those names mean anything to you, God help you: I think Furious 7 is the first film in the series that makes no effort to be atomically approachable. You have to know the backstory for it to make any sense, full stop. If you’re just there for the sweet action sequences, sure, I hear you — but any attempt to untangle the countless relationships that have developed over the course of six previous movies without having seen them recently enough to remember them will fail. I sound ungrateful, but believe me: I appreciate the thought behind Wan’s effort to cover all of this nostalgic ground in a little over two hours. It just doesn’t work; it doesn’t cohere; I felt strangely disengaged with these characters that I had learned to love over a decade and a half. I just wanted something to sink my teeth into, but Wan rarely gives the viewer an opportunity. And in what little time we have for actual character development, we get practically none. Ramsey, a conveniently attractive computer hacker and literal caged damsel-in-distress, serves little function but to enforce tropes and incite an array of cringeworthy lines and camera angles. Yet she was in the movie long enough that it feels odd to know so little about her. The movie does eventually settle into a series of awesome action sequences Kurt Russell’s ""Mr. Nobody"" comes and goes with even less fanfare; the character basically functions as a narrator to explain what’s going to go down in the next action sequence. (My colleague Ross Miller, seated next to me, described him as a ""Call of Duty menu system."") And speaking of action sequences, Furious 7 does eventually settle into a series of them — protracted and higher-budget than ever — which is really what you paid your $20 or whatever to see. This is the bread and butter not just of this film, but of the entire series, especially since the heady post-Tokyo Drift days. Key moments of each of these sequences were spoiled by trailers, but there’s still enough additional meat in the movie to get you riled up, possibly throwing a fist in the air on occasion and screaming ""hell yes"" with a giant smile across your face. I’m not saying that’s what I did, just that you may feel compelled to do that, and you should feel okay about it. And maybe that’s what Furious 7 needed more of: as much as I liked seeing Hector for nostalgia’s sake, I didn’t need to see him for a few fleeting seconds in a Race Wars scene barely a few minutes long. Perhaps I was spoiled by the adrenaline-soaked perfection of 5 and 6, where the action never stopped, we got precisely the correct amount of touchy-feely team interaction, and we didn’t care that runways were 30 miles long because we were young and innocent and everything was perfect with the world. It’s probably no coincidence that the last four films were all directed by Justin Lin, whose deft touch for the franchise was sorely missed here. Lin’s unapologetic love for over-the-top explosions was just as honed as Wan’s, but he did a far better job taking our hands and leading us through each film, building characters and relationships along the way. (And his hype-building post-credit scenes were legendary. Furious 7 has none.) Justin, when you’re done with your 'True Detective' adventure, come back Justin, when you’re done with your True Detective adventure, come back. James Wan, please return to the Saw series, because the first one was your magnum opus. As for the handling of Walker’s death, without spoiling it, I’ll only say that it left me as unsatisfied as most of Furious 7’s mindless vignettes. The strategy seemed strangely rushed and poorly thought-out, considering the additional production time that was allotted to rewrite the script. In the inevitable  Fast 8 — the screenwriters will still have a bit more work to do to fully explain O’Conner’s (and, in all likelihood, Mia’s) absence. It’s entirely possible, of course, that my fandom has simply blinded me to Furious 7’s greatness. The action sequences — particularly Abu Dhabi, with the supercar leaping between buildings — are legitimately phenomenal, and the scenes filmed after Walker’s passing, in which his brothers stepped in for him, were never distracting or even noticeable without looking closely. Maybe I’m missing something. The early reviews are extremely positive, and Rotten Tomatoes is closing in on 90 percent. Maybe my expectations were unrealistic; maybe nothing short of a four-hour marathon with 45 minutes of heart-pounding Race Wars would’ve fit my bill. See it on opening weekend when the theater is thick with hype And if Furious 7 deserves credit for one thing, it’s closing (or at least trying to close) some doors from the past that make way for new ones to be opened. Vin Diesel says that the next movie will be set in New York, a marked departure from the series’ deep LA roots. And Lucas Black (Tokyo Drift’s Sean Boswell) has been rumored to return in 8 and beyond; maybe he can step up and start to fill the huge hole left by Paul Walker. Either way, I encourage action movie buffs and diehard Fast fanatics alike to see this one, preferably on opening weekend when the theater is thick with hype. (There’s no other franchise where clapping and screaming throughout the movie is as utterly appropriate.) I need people to talk about it with, after all.

That's why NASA is looking everywhere for ways to improve fuel efficiency. Two of its most promising projects — a bug-repellant coating and a new technology for smaller vertical tails — are now ready to be tested in the real world. Bugs splattered across the surface of a commercial jet might seem pretty insignificant, but NASA researchers say they can decrease fuel efficiency by as much as six percent. When those dead bugs collect on aerodynamically sensitive elements like the leading edge of wings, they disturb the airflow over the surface. That causes turbulent air and drag — which ultimately reduces efficiency. So NASA's testing five different nonstick coatings on Boeing's ""ecoDemonstrator"" 757 aircraft over a number of 15 different flights at a particularly buggy airport, located in Shreveport, Louisiana. Researchers will not only test to see how many fewer bugs stick to the surface, but also whether the coatings can withstand the rigors of commercial aviation. It's all about reducing drag NASA is also testing a novel way to cut down the size of the vertical tail on commercial airliners — reducing weight and fuel use in the process. According to the agency, the only reason the tails are so large is to assist with airplane stability at low speeds during landing and take off. It's also seen as a safety measure should an aircraft suffer an engine failure. But the large tails only weigh down planes while they cruise. So NASA worked with Boeing to try to make smaller, lighter tails that could behave like the old, bigger tails when needed.     The solution? Thirty-one tiny jets along the edge of the tail that can selectively blow air over the surface and generate the same stabilizing forces with a tail 17 percent smaller than the ones in use today. The agency worked with Boeing to develop the technology, and will test it this year in nine separate flights with a 757 test aircraft. The testing will include simulated engine failures, and researchers expect the development of smaller tails to cut back on half of one percent of fuel usage. Should testing go as planned, the developments made by NASA and Boeing will become available to the public, and hopefully implemented in future aircraft retrofits and designs.",0.3407554304785577,0.6592445695214423,0.6114740406213075,406,4.9605911330049262,238,5.920168067226891,0,2,"Science, Transportation"

Among them are plans to construct parks and paths wrapping around lower Manhattan that include elevated areas and flood barriers that can flip into position when necessary. Another project aims to slow the waves and stabilize the city's beaches by placing breakwaters around Staten Island. The breakwaters wouldn't simply be barriers for the waves though: they'll be designed as habitats for marine life, providing protection for finfish, shellfish, and lobsters. Other plans have been chosen to protect nearby Jersey City, Hoboken, and Weehawken using pumps to remove water. These aren't the plans that are meant to provide thorough protection against a storm, however. Instead, these are the result of a competition sponsored by the US Department of Housing and Urban Development, called Rebuild By Design, and is meant to find new models for combating the effects of storms that may be useful elsewhere in the US. ""These [breakwater] oyster beds that you heard about, FEMA is watching this project very closely, thinking about not just whether it can be repeated throughout the region, but in Florida and many other places that are susceptible,"" Housing and Urban Development secretary Shaun Donovan said yesterday. Donovan said that the projects might also receive funding from insurance providers, which could see lower costs because of their protections. ""So the models that we're talking about here were specifically designed to be replicable,"" he said, ""to bring not just more government funding, but to bring private sector funding as well."" New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said that the projects will begin to take shape over the next few years. ""I think you're going to see over four or five years a hugely different physical reality in this city,"" he said. Entrants in the design competition have, of course, created mockups of what their projects will look like around the city. Several of those visuals can be found below.  The breakwaters would be made from Econcrete, which is designed for safe use in marine environments. The breakwater project also wants to build ""water hubs"" around Staten Island to promote activities like kayaking, while improving the community's knowledge of what's happening in the water around them. The colored area shows where defensive structures like raised parks and hidden walls would be built. Raised green spaces like this would appear in the Lower East Side. These diagrams show how the hidden flood walls would work. Here, it's shown flipping down from an elevated area. The project imagines using the retractable flood walls as art installations too.

We thought then that the radical redesign of iOS would be the biggest update in the platform's history. But in some ways, we were wrong. While iOS 7 brought a massive change in aesthetic direction, it remained functionally similar to its predecessors. iOS 8, on the other hand, is a subtle but important overhaul of the most important thing about the design of Apple's mobile OS: the way you use it. The beauty of iOS has always been its simplicity. Apple gave users a springboard of app icons and taught them to jump in and out of apps to get things done. The introduction of the App Store with iOS 2, multitasking with iOS 4, and Notification Center with iOS 5 certainly shook things up, but the core paradigm remained. Many designers, including Apple’s Jony Ive, strive to make things simple, following functionalist principles of ""less is more."" But by not acknowledging a shift in the way people use their devices, iOS began to feel like it was stuck in the past. By not acknowledging a shift in the way people use their devices, iOS started to feel stuck in the past Thanks largely to the App Store, we all use third-party apps — millions of them. We shoot and tinker in VSCO Cam, we share with Instagram, meaning something as simple as editing and uploading a photo on iOS presently means trawling through multiple applications. That’s just one example. Everyone has their own workflows, their own ways of keeping in touch with friends, sharing information, and getting things done. Apple added white space to apps and switched to cleaner fonts in iOS 7, both of which improved the overall user experience, but that improvement is lost when we’re required to jump through hoops to perform basic actions. In the meantime, Microsoft and Google have strived to put third-party apps at the center of their OSes through systems like Android Intents and Windows Charms. With iOS 8 App Extensions, Apple is finally acknowledging that its age-old concepts of user behavior needed to be brought in line with its competitors’. Third-party apps like Waterlogue and VSCO Cam can offer their filters within other apps. Third-party apps like Waterlogue and VSCO Cam can offer their filters within other apps. App Extensions allow apps to interact with one another. This interaction can be as simple as editing a photo with VSCO Cam filters before sharing it — without leaving the Photos app — or as complex as translating a webpage in Safari using a third-party app like Bing. Extensions can also allow apps to act like widgets, letting users bid on an eBay auction or like an update on Facebook directly from the Notification Center. Apple is yet again taking simple ideas that can be found in Android and elsewhere and remixing them with aplomb. Sharing information between apps is one of the cornerstones of the Android experience, and bringing that to iOS in an intelligent way will truly change the way you use an iPhone or iPad. This appropriation of features has been going on for years, and can be found elsewhere in Apple’s latest update, with third-party keyboards lifted from Android, self-destructive messaging from Snapchat, and better threaded conversations from WhatsApp finally coming to iOS 8. With a shift in UX taken care of, iOS 8 also attempts to patch some holes in Apple’s new design language. The company made some missteps with iOS 7, both visually and mechanically. Some of those missteps were implicitly acknowledged: the iOS 7 Apple showed developers last June was quite different from the one it pushed to consumers months later. The system font was replaced between beta and commercial release, the incoming call screen was redesigned, and the shiny new Control Center was slightly decluttered, to name but a few changes. Earlier this year, iOS 7.1 brought with it more refinement, as the shutdown screen changed significantly, the incoming call prompt was switched up again, animations were changed, and default apps saw a number of design tweaks to Jony Ive's original formula. But there were still niggling issues with 7.1, which 8 goes a long way towards addressing. The most significant fix comes to notifications. Just like in Android, they’re now actionable from either the lock screen or Notification Center. That’ll allow you to quickly respond to messages or accept calendar invites — something that’s always required you to jump into an app until now — but also facilitates more nuanced uses like swiping down on an email you don’t care about and quickly marking it as read.   This revamp of notifications also reverts one of the more bizarre iOS 7 changes: the segmentation of ""missed"" and ""all"" notifications is no more. Another step backward — and forward — can be found in the App Store. Last year, Apple revamped the store to bring it in line with the rest of its new OS, introducing cleaner graphics and acres of white space. At the same time it switched to a nonsensical pagination system for search results that displayed only a single app at a time. It should come as no surprise that the announcement of something as simple as infinitely scrollable search results for iOS 8 got one of the loudest cheers of Monday’s keynote from developers. Despite the improvements, things aren’t perfect. The touch targets that clear messages from Notification Center are still perplexingly small, the icons for Newsstand, Camera, and other apps are as polarizing as ever, and the reliance on transparency and animations to add depth and motion will still not sit well with some. But those unhappy with last year’s redesign will have to come to terms with the fact that their taste in software design doesn’t gel with Jony Ive’s. Despite the changes and concessions, Apple has generally stuck to its new aesthetic, building on and tweaking it to improve usability. It’s also bringing much of that redesign to OS X, rebalancing its two operating systems after a year of severe style clashes and backing it up with a real focus on continuity between desktop, mobile, and tablet. Apple is moving in the right direction again Last year we mused that the raw materials for a cohesive and useful operating system were hidden behind iOS 7’s bright icons and glimmering transparencies. That potential is now beginning to be fulfilled. There’s a lot of work left to be done before iOS feels as revolutionary as it once did, but Apple is moving in the right direction once again.",0.544322554082745,0.455677445917255,0.3374711664452314,1113,4.9227313566936211,537,6.322160148975791,0,0,"Apple, Design, Mobile, Tech, Editorial"

Rosenthal tells Recode that he believes Lytro's light-field technology is the ""perfect solution"" to recording video for virtual reality.

Applying that tech to video could mean that filmmakers will be able to capture a world that better responds to the movements of someone wearing a virtual reality headset. Of course, there are a lot of hurdles that Lytro will need to surmount to get there — including the fact that, in spite of being able to refocus images, its cameras still can't land a single truly sharp focus. That Lytro is laying off employees in order to invest in these new areas also suggests that its cameras haven't been particularly successful, which is no surprise considering their niche appeal.

Now, Yelp is trying to defend its shaky honor by suing a company that sells fake positive reviews to restaurants.  Yelp says Yelp Director is a scam According to a lawsuit filed last week in a California court, Yelp is suing the operators of Yelp Director, a company that also does business under the names Revpley and Revleap. Yelp claims Yelp Director undermines its integrity by allowing restaurants to post fake positive reviews and bury negative ones. As Consumerist points out, Yelp accuses the company of ""trademark infringement, unfair competition, cybersquatting, contract interference"" and a ""state-level claim of false advertising."" Yelp first discovered Yelp Director in November of 2013 and sent the company a cease and desist order, but Yelp Director never complied. The lawsuit includes an email Yelp Director sent to potential clients: Hi there, We invented a software that allows you to proactively generate a large number of 4 and 5 star reviews from your customers in a way that makes them stick to the front page of Yelp. All reviews 3 star and below are filtered by the system and never posted online. As CBS News points out, it's unclear if Yelp Director was ever successful in actually getting these fake reviews to ""stick"" to Yelp's pages. In a blog post, Yelp called Yelp Director a ""scam"" that could ""put small businesses at risk"" by charging for artificial inflation. Last September, a California court ruled that Yelp had the legal authority to manipulate ratings and remove positive reviews from its pages, which means Yelp is just as likely to mislead its users as anyone else.",0.5956928255370235,0.4043071744629765,0.7951533428997619,344,5.0523255813953485,205,5.9902439024390244,0,0,"Business, Culture, Web"

The company is a close partner of the ride-sharing giant Uber, which funnels drivers with low credit to Santander loan officers. It’s not the company’s first brush with the law: the lender holds over $40 billion in car loans and has repeatedly been the subject of criminal investigations into its subprime auto loan arm. According to the US Department of Justice, Santander violated the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA), a consumer protection statute that forces lenders to seek court approval before repossessing assets of active duty soldiers. The bank seized Davis’s car and billed Davis — still at boot camp — $9,000 Since the Civil War, military personnel have been afforded some degree of special protections from civil claims like bankruptcy, foreclosure, and divorce. In 1919, the SCRA was enacted to allow military personnel reprieve from debt collectors while fighting in World War I. Today, companies like Santander are still required to verify the military status of loan holders against a federal database. If a soldier makes a payment on a loan but then becomes delinquent, the courts often intervene and delay repossession. The SCRA is intended to ensure that soldiers do not return from active duty and find their homes foreclosed or their cars repossessed. But that’s exactly what happened to 19-year-old Army Specialist Joshua Davis. When Davis first took out a car loan from Santander, he made an initial payment and then informed the loan officer he would be leaving for boot camp the next day. But within a month, Santander began making collections calls on the car loan. The bank eventually seized Davis’ car in the middle of the night, from outside his home. Santander then billed Davis — still at boot camp — for $9,000, sold his car at auction, and reported him to the credit bureaus. Davis sought help from the US Army’s Legal Assistance Program, which in turn asked the Department of Justice to look into a potential violation of the SCRA. The ensuing investigation reviewed Santander’s compliance of the SCRA from 2008–2013 and uncovered a pattern of abuse described by the DOJ as ""intentional, willful, and taken in disregard for the rights of servicemembers."" ""Those who answer this nation’s call to duty understandably have much on their minds while they are in military service,"" said Acting Assistant Attorney General Vanita Gupta of the Civil Rights Division. ""Whether their car will be seized and sold at auction should not be an additional worry."" Even before today’s revelations, Uber’s affiliation with Santander drew much criticism. The DOJ subpoened Santander’s subprime arm in August, and Uber has omitted any mention of its partner’s subprime business in promotional materials that steer would-be drivers toward the bank. Santander's abuse was ""intentional, willful, and taken in disregard for the rights of servicemembers."" Santander’s violations of the SCRA are particularly worrying for military veterans working for Uber. Last September, Uber launched UberMILITARY, a campaign to employ at least 50,000 military veterans and active duty personnel. So far, over 10,000 military personnel have signed up. UberMILITARY actively recruited veterans at job fairs, promising ""flexible"" and ""well paid work."" Veterans who did not own a car, or who could not afford one, were encouraged to apply to Santander for financing.  Speaking to The Verge in September, Uber spokesperson Ariel Goren said, ""We never want not owning a car to be a barrier to driving with Uber. That is why partnering with Uber gives drivers the option to finance a vehicle."" She went on to emphasize that ""this is particularly salient for veterans who may have incomplete credit histories due to deployment."" Since the launch of UberMILITARY, Uber’s forged high-profile partnerships with veterans groups — including Hiring our Heroes and Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America — and worked with military brass such as Robert Gates and Stanley Chrystal to court drivers. Uber recruiters at a Hiring Our Heroes in Boston in October encouraged veterans who didn’t own cars to explore Uber financing options such as Santander. The push for drivers to finance from companies like Santander comes from the very top: CEO Travis Kalanick personally encourages drivers to borrow money to drive for the company, and downplays the risk of taking out an auto-loan. ""The risk of financing…goes way down when they’re [drivers] affiliated with us because they get in that car and go to work everyday,"" he told Bloomberg. Since last fall, Uber has been bombarding its drivers with emails touting its ""financing"" options. ""We’ve got to light up a whole bunch of supply,"" Kalanick told The Wall Street Journal. ""We’re literally talking about powering billions of dollars in car purchases."" The settlement doesn’t indicate whether the bank has changed its policies It’s also no secret that Uber’s relationship with financiers like Santander helps to pump up its supply of drivers — bringing in more money for Uber. That’s the logic behind recruiting veterans as drivers, whose earnings have translated into at least 3.5 million dollars in company profits since UberMilitary launched in the fall. The DOJ’s settlement with Santander must still be approved by a district judge in Texas before it takes effect. The settlement also doesn’t indicate whether the bank has changed its policies — Santander is now required to begin reviewing its more recent auto loans and ""provide compensation for any additional unlawful repossessions that may have occurred since February 2013."" That would include any repossessed cars purchased by veterans through UberMILITARY over the last six months. So far, Uber will not release data on how many of its drivers took out financing via Santander and would not comment further on the settlement or its relationship with the auto lender. Uber also gave no indication whether any of the 1,100 cars unlawfully repossessed by Santander belonged to its own drivers.",0.36274723163245237,0.6372527683675476,0.8645108140722176,999,5.308308308308308,516,6.4534883720930232,0,0,"Business, Report"

You like WhatsApp, but your best friend prefers Facebook Messenger; your little brother is on Snapchat, and your mom sticks to iMessage. A simple conversation can get tangled up in a slew of different apps. Trying to craft a common standard A year and a half ago, a new startup called Layer launched with the goal of creating a common standard: a new messaging protocol that would let any app to communicate with another. It was a continuation of a dream they had pushed during the instant messaging era with the creation of XMPP, better known as Jabber. In mobile messaging, that unified world is still largely a fantasy, but Layer has signed up 1,500 customers during its private beta, with a waiting list of 8,500 more. Today it’s launching to the public and debuting Atlas, an open source design library to help integrate its messaging capabilities into company’s mobile offerings. The sales pitch for Layer was that any app could add messaging with just 10 lines of code. For startups who haven’t launched, Layer is free. But Layer charges its larger clients — leading apps in the dating, games, and sports categories who clock in at more than a million monthly users. ""We make it easy for the smaller teams to get started using Layer, allowing them to focus on creating a great experience for their users, and hopefully to become a massive success down the road,"" says Ron Palmeri, the company’s founder and CEO. Helping small startups in the hopes they will become big customers  The offering has won big praise for accelerating the time to get from idea to app. ""The craziest thing about that experience was how fast it went,"" says Ryan Freitas, a designer who used Layer while working on mobile products for About.me. ""We went from loose mockups to a fully functional product in less than two weeks. Given that we don’t have anyone here who is a messaging expert, that normally would have taken us five to six months."" The biggest complaint from companies trying to use Layer, on the other hand, was that they didn’t know how to create the design or interaction around the messages. It was great to add messaging to an app, but it was hell when that functionality introduced bugs or errors. Atlas is an attempt to solve that. ""It gives you a toolkit to easily craft a great messaging interface,"" says Palmeri. ""And importantly, to make sure that what you have looks distinct from other folks who are using us."" Connecting constellations of apps with a single owner Layer is hoping that it can become a lynchpin of the booming app ecosystem. ""Like Stripe or Mapbox, we want to be the back end that delivers a core function of mobile software,"" says Palmeri. They haven’t yet created a federated universe of apps from different companies that talk with one another, but Layer says it is seeing crosstalk between disparate apps with a single owner. As tech investor Fred Wilson wrote last year, titans like Google, Yahoo, and most recently Microsoft are acquiring top mobile services at a rapid pace, leading to interesting constellations of apps. These clusters create an opportunity for Layer, which can open up channels of communication. ""We have lots of requests from companies that want to make this network of apps capable of talking to one another, and to enable a single sign-on, so you can sync or share contacts and messaging history,"" says Palmeri. ""It’s a little bit of our vision starting to unfold.""",0.8528554629485403,0.1471445370514597,0.7751131022870487,642,4.8255451713395638,366,5.8196721311475406,0,0,"Business, Tech, Report"

These days, companies can catch multi-billion-dollar valuations on the fly. Take, for instance, the big numbers bandied about this week. Investors are waving term sheets at Snapchat for $500 million in financing under the assumption that the app is worth $19 billion. Pinterest is also in the process of raising $500 million, but at a more modest $11 billion valuation. ""Facing overwhelming demand"" from investors, Uber agreed to accept an additional billion dollars in financing, just a few weeks after the e-hailing app closed a $1.2 billion funding round that valued the company at $40 billion. Fortune and The Wall Street Journal have both illustrated the growing number of startups that investors think are worth $1 billion. (Companies that have crossed that threshold are called ""unicorns."" It's a term used mainly by insiders, but it helps illustrate this age of magical thinking.) To put the recent fervor in perspective, it also helps to see how rapidly these multi-billion-dollar valuations have multiplied. We created a graph (below) using data from CB Insights, a venture capital analytics company, to chart seven of the fastest-growing and most promising (if unprofitable) among them. You can click on the dots or on the company names to filter. A quick note on how profitability relates to valuations: it doesn't! At least not yet. A source told The Verge that Pinterest is seeking an $11 billion valuation even though revenue for 2014 was under $50 million, and projected revenue for 2015 is roughly $200 million. Pinterest declined to comment. Venture capitalist Bill Gurley — an investor in Uber and Snapchat through his firm, Benchmark Capital — once called multiplying revenue a ""crude tool"" for calculating a startup's valuation. Instead of using that metric, current VC logic prioritizes fast growth above all else. VC firms are fond of noting that only 30 percent of cellphones used today are smartphones, giving their portfolio companies plenty of room to grow. Plus, there are all those real world industries to try to topple. Build momentum now, figure out how to make money later — otherwise, you'll miss out on the next near-mythic exit. Facebook bought Instagram for $1 billion in 2012 when it had 30 million iOS users, then paid $22 billion for WhatsApp, which had more than 450 million users around the world, just two years later. Investors would much rather get in early than miss out on that kind of stratospheric growth. If Snapchat, the latest poster child for the massive ballooning of valuations, signs those term sheets, its valuation will have nearly doubled in six months — or three months, depending on whether you look at when news of its latest funding leaked or when the round ended. (For private companies, valuations are typically revealed as part of a funding announcement. The dates on our chart reflect when a funding round closed. You can read more on CB Insight's methodology here.) The first most valuable company is Xiaomi, which is based in China. The second most valuable venture capital vacuum is Uber. Last June, the e-hailing app was valued at $17 billion. Six months later, investors decided it was worth $40 billion. A similar dynamic explains why Pinterest can say it will use that $500 million to do things like expand in Europe and Asia and ""develop a business model"" later. Why is there such a focus on a handful of companies when Fortune recently identified 80 ""unicorns"" galloping around with $1 billion stamped on their hides? Because the surge in venture capital is fueled by bets on a few pretty, pretty ponies. According to CB Insights, VC investment in internet companies expanded to $19.6 billion in 2014, driven by ""mega-financings to a small but growing group."" That's why the amount of funding was up 67 percent year over year, while the deal activity for 2014 was up by only 7 percent. One major factor in these super-sized startups is the reluctance to go public, if they go public at all. Silicon Valley investor Marc Andreessen blamed regulatory changes that make it harder and more expensive to file for an IPO. Fusion points out that the rule forcing startups to go public once they hit 500 shareholders no longer applies. Uber CEO Travis Kalanick wants to ""grow in the private markets instead of cashing out Pets.com-style,"" says Fusion, because he can. Now that the fun is happening in the private markets, the multi-billion bonanza has attracted players outside Silicon Valley. Last April, Andreessen cautioned startups against accepting over-sized valuations from out-of-towners. But it doesn't seem like founders heard his tweets. Snapchat raised a $50 million Series C from the New York-based hedge fund Coatue Management. Fidelity Investments, the mutual fund and financial services group from Boston, participated in Pinterest's past two rounds of funding. Airbnb’s $475 million Series D included T. Rowe Price, the massive global asset manager based in Boston. Mutual fund manager Wellington Management, also based in Boston, is diving into the pre-IPO end of the pool. Uber’s investors reportedly include Wellington, Fidelity, BlackRock (the New York investment manager that also owns shares in Exxon, Shell, McDonald’s and Nestle), and, best of all, Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund. We are very far from the line of VC firms on Sand Hill Road. Andreessen's warning is self-serving. Local venture capital firms have got fat off easy money from institutional investors seeking growth. But the presence of interlopers means giant pools of money chasing too few good investments. Historically, this scenario has not ended well.  If you know the answer, call me. Wld luv 2 talk. Watching startups like Uber, Airbnb, and Snapchat expand over the past few years has clamped down my knee-jerk notion that every bubble must burst. I think of it as a boom with bearable shockwaves that don't ripple out to the public markets. The dumb ones will disappear, margins will shrink, but the mega-valuations will stay in the billions. But you should listen to professional investors like Gurley and Andreessen, who were pumping up valuations way before Qatar came calling. They have been sounding the alarm — loudly and across many, many tweets. 4/When the market turns, and it will turn, we will find out who has been swimming without trunks on: many high burn rate co's will VAPORIZE. In the same cover package where Fortune waxed poetic about unicorns and ""decacorns"" (don't ask), the magazine published Gurley's prediction that 2015 would be fail whale after fail whale. Given 80 minutes, you probably couldn't name half of those 80 startups worth $1 billion. Gurley said startups will collapse under the burden of heavy valuations and constricting liquidation preferences that say who gets paid first if and when there's an exit. But I get the sense he's opining on other people's companies. One source said Gurley — who, if you'll recall, was an Uber investor — had Lyft in mind when he started ringing the alarm.  Unrealistic expectations sunk former stars like Zynga, which was valued at $10 billion in June, 2011, which went public six months later at $7 billion and is currently trading at a market cap of $2 billion. But cautionary tales like Zynga don't seem to be getting any play right now. Unicorn chasers still point to Facebook as proof that you can grow now, monetize later. The social network did not go public until it was valued at more than $100 billion and is currently trading at a market cap of $223 billion. The source who shared Pinterest's revenue told me that ""eventually companies have to grow into their valuations, but not that soon. Someday the reality will set in,"" and then they'll be valued on revenue.

Google's Android OEM partners have attempted to shore things up on their end through things like Samsung Knox, but now Google is taking matters into its own hands in a big way with Android for Work. Google first introduced the initiative last summer at its I/O developer conference, and today the company is formally launching the program and releasing plenty of details on how exactly it'll work. The basic goal is to make it a lot easier for businesses to deploy Android devices to their employees — and to make the Android devices that employees are already bringing to work on their own more secure. Enterprise mobility has come ""from a few people that have Blackberrys to more than 100 million managed devices,"" said product manager Rajen Sheth, ""but that's just scratching the surface."" Android for Work consists of two parts: a set of new technologies that Google has built into Android 5.0 Lollipop and a wide-ranging set of partnerships with hardware makers, software developers, enterprise mobility management companies, and more. Google is getting serious about having Android in as many businesses as possible The first core technology Google will deploy is the concept of work profiles. ""We've separated out your work life and personal life as complete separate users on the device,"" said project manager Rajen Sheth. That keeps all apps, data, and communications separate and manageable by a company's IT team. Sheth noted then that Google made sure to build its profiles in a way that won't require users to actually jump back and forth between profiles — instead, apps that are provisioned by your company for work usage have a work ""badge"" identifying them as such. Companies can manage those apps as they see fit without touching any of the personal data or apps a user might have on their phone. Work profiles are built right into Android Lollipop, but Google said that it'll support older devices with a downloadable Android for Work app that will provide a very similar experience (and corresponding control by corporate IT) for devices running Android 4.0 or later. As far as managing apps goes, Google Play for Work will let any app in the Play Store be deployed by an IT department without the need for it to be provisioned or ""wrapped"" so that a corporation can control it. You don't have to be a Google Apps customer to use Android for Work Instead, users will be able to install any app from the Play Store if approved by their company, and the company can delete or push out apps at will. Companies will also be able to bulk purchase apps if they want to deploy out to their users. Of course, it's still up to companies to make sure the apps they are pushing out to users are safe and secure, but companies can be as restrictive as they want when it comes to what apps their users can download. The last core piece of Google's Android for Work offering is its built-in set of productivity tools — but instead of keeping people in Google's own ecosystem, Sheth said that ""we're making it easy for people to use a variety of email and calendar systems on Android."" Essentially, Google is offering work-specific mail, calendar, and contacts app for companies not using Google Apps. Exchange is naturally supported, and a variety of document types beyond Google Docs will work, as well. Samsung, Sony, HTC, Motorola, and many more are on board Google's not doing this alone, either. The company has a pretty serious slate of partners to start with across four different categories: devices, applications, networking, and management. The partner list is long and includes such heavyweights as Samsung, HTC, Motorola, Adobe, Box, Salesforce, Cisco, Citrix, BlackBerry, and many more. Indeed, these partnerships are part of the reason we haven't heard much about Android for Work since Google I/O — Sheth said that Google didn't want to have an ""empty launch."" Instead, the company has been able to test with customers and build partnerships so that it can hit the ground running. BlackBerry's partnership with Google is particularly notable, as the company's BlackBerry Exchange Server is still seen as a leader in the security space, even as its devices are less and less relevant to consumers. Working with Google could be an important step to keeping BES a leader, and it's not entirely surprising — BlackBerry partnered with Samsung late last year to help beef up Knox security. Now, all Android at Work users could benefit from the new partnership, not just Samsung users (assuming their company users BES). How widely adopted Android for Work will be remains to be seen, but Google is right that the opportunity in front of it is huge — and both the partner list and the technology that the company is putting behind the initiative should serve notice that the company is taking the opportunity seriously. At the very least, it looks a lot better than using that old BlackBerry your company makes you carry around.",0.5915709982193624,0.40842900178063757,0.1666746202741606,894,4.883668903803132,416,6.0504807692307692,0,0,"Business, Google, Tech"

It's been a much-asked question since this morning when Pebble did just that, dropping their new Pebble Time onto Kickstarter. For now, it's the only place you can order the watch. There was even a $40 discount for anyone who got their order in early. But why? There's the sentimental angle: Pebble started out on Kickstarter, and their strongest supporters are still Kickstarter backers who bought in early. Then there's that meta-sentimental offshoot, the PR angle: as long as they're on Kickstarter, they look like the scrappy underdogs, set to do battle with the juggernaut Apple Watch this summer. But the real answer may be even simpler: money. Pebble simply makes more money selling watches on Kickstarter than anywhere else except its own web store. The company gets the money faster, and it gets to keep more of the retail price. In fact, it's not even close. The company gets the money faster, and it gets to keep more of the retail price The first thing to consider is the margin. Under the current set-up, Pebble is giving up as much as 10 cents on every dollar it brings in: Kickstarter takes 5 percent, and payment processor Stripe takes between 3 and 5 percent for processing the money. There are smaller margins out there (Etsy, for instance, has whittled the margin down to 3 percent), but it's hard to do much better, particularly on the processor fee. More importantly, it's worlds better than conventional retail. Sell the same watch at Best Buy, for instance, and the default margin would be closer to 50 percent. A fantastic negotiator might be able to whittle it down to 35, but it's unlikely — and for obvious reasons. Best Buy has rent to pay and floor managers to feed, all of which cuts into Pebble's bottom line. Then there's conventional e-commerce sites like Amazon. Amazon doesn't have rent or retail employees, although the margins tend to be competitive with conventional retailers. The bigger issue is when they pay, rather than how much. Amazon would need the watches upfront, but Pebble wouldn't get its money until two or even three months after the first round of sales. That makes it impossible to use pre-orders as startup capital — a problem that self-run crowdfunding campaigns also run into. Even Pebble’s own web store can't raise funds off pre-orders. Outside of Kickstarter's fundraising model, those upfront terms are hard to come by. Even Pebble’s own web store can't raise funds off pre-orders That's particularly an issue for Pebble. This kind of hardware is expensive to produce, and the company isn't planning to ship anything until May. Pebble has already raised more than 6 million dollars on the project, with millions more still to come, and having that money in March instead of July makes a big difference. After raising $26 million in outside funding, the company isn't exactly strapped for cash — but when you're juggling this many models and this many orders, every million counts. If Pebble thinks up a great new product after the Apple Watch comes out this summer, that Kickstarter money could be the difference between rushing out a new model and waiting for the next fundraising round. There’s a limit to this model. $6 million seems like a lot of sales, but it’s coming from a small group of buyers — less than 30,000, as of press time. It’s just a fraction of the world’s smartwatch buyers, but to reach the rest of them, Pebble will have to go through the usual retail channels. A lot of the world just isn’t ready to buy electronics on Kickstarter. Many of them don’t even know the site exists. They might be interested in the Pebble Time, but they’ll wait until they can get it on Amazon or see it on the shelf at Best Buy. If Pebble is going to compete with Apple, the company needs to reach everyone, which means going through every channel. But until then, it can drum up a lot of money by staying inside the crowdfunding bubble.",0.28856165565773295,0.711438344342267,0.18765796915407743,694,4.8069164265129682,380,5.6868421052631577,0,0,"Business, Mobile, Tech"

The documents details a program called IRRITANT HORN, which delivers malware by intercepting web traffic to and from mobile application servers. One slide details Samsung's update protocol, while another pinpoints the Google Play servers in France, used to deliver updates to phones throughout northern Africa. Once the path to those servers was established, the NSA could intercept traffic before it reached the servers, injecting malware to specific users through a man-in-the-middle attack. The files would appear to come from a trusted app store, but they would really be coming from the NSA. From there, the NSA could deliver tools from its extensive catalog of surveillance programs, including pulling a user's contact list or reporting their location in near-real-time. Both Samsung and Google employ TLS encryption to protect against man-in-the-middle attacks like this, but cryptographers have been speculating for years that the NSA has found a way to break or circumvent those protections.   The documents date from November 2011 to February 2012, and it's unclear if the plan was ever put into action. Still, it demonstrates the NSA's abiding interest in breaking user protections to collect data and deliver malware.

At the same time, security researchers have warned that export controls on vulnerability research would mean regulating the flow of information. Now, the first of those regulations are finally reaching America — and the security world couldn't be angrier. The proposals come out of an international agreement called The Wassenaar Arrangement, laid out in 2013. It covers export rules for all sorts of technologies, providing broad guidelines for how countries should license technology and software as it crosses international borders. The agreement leaves the details of enforcement up to individual nations, and the US Department of Commerce is only now catching up. On Wednesday, the department's Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) issued proposed rules for how it was planning to implement the information security portions of Wassenaar. The rules will be open for comment for the next two months, allowing anyone with a stake in the matter to have their say. ""Intrusion software is the sword that hones the shield."" So far, the comments from the security world have been blistering. Researchers are particularly worried about a measure that would institute new controls on any work related to intrusion software. The measures were proposed by the UK delegation after spyware implants like FinFisher became popular among brutally oppressive regimes abroad. The implants are typically made in Western countries and exported to oppressive governments like Bahrain and Syria, but aside from statutes on encryption, there are no export controls covering the software. Still, much of the security world sees the Wassenaar rules as a cure that's worse than the disease. Nearly all security research is somehow related to intrusion into a protected system, and it's still unclear what will be restricted by the act. Researchers often develop and sell unpublished vulnerabilities (known as zero-days), and many fear the new regulations could squash that market entirely. Wassenaar's exemptions for scientific research or public domain software also seem to have been stripped out, leaving academic researchers with nowhere to turn. Marsh Ray, a prominent security software developer, says the controls would change the entire industry, causing problems for even defensive security researchers. ""[Intrusion software] is the sword that hones the shield,"" says Ray. ""It's impossible to build effective defenses without free and open access to the latest techniques of the attackers."" ""It simply never happens that government regulation constrains the tools available to the real attackers."" There's still a lot of uncertainty on both sides of the issue, which has only heightened fears of overregulation. ""Vulnerability research is not controlled,"" BIS officials said in a call on Wednesday. ""What would be controlled is the development, testing, and productizing of an exploit or intrusion software."" But many companies don't take a vulnerability seriously until they see proof it can be exploited, which makes it difficult to say precisely where research ends and development begins. In part, these things are unclear  because Commerce simply hasn't decided all the issues yet. BIS officials have left a lot of wiggle room in the recent proposals, and have said outright that a number of issues are still undecided, pending more feedback from the comment period. Collin Anderson, a researcher who's been following the process, says much of the uncertainty is just about Commerce officials looking to find out more. ""There's not always a lot of clarity in regards to what's covered under the proposed exploit rules,"" says Anderson, referring to the recent BIS statements. ""What is clear is that there's a lack of information."" In part, that's what the comment period is meant to address, but it's easy to see why that uncertainty makes researchers nervous. If the rule-making process breaks the wrong way, it's easy to imagine simple vulnerabilities being subject to the same restrictions as military computers or firearms. ""The security community needs to engage in order to get a public policy that doesn't harm them."" The basic structure of the restrictions is also cause for concern. Even heavily restricted goods will still be exportable with the right license, which gives the licensing system a huge amount of power over the security industry more broadly. But the system is both opaque and potentially inconsistent, leading many to worry that government-friendly vendors and regimes will skate through the system while smaller firms languish. At the same time, stronger licensing may not affect criminals and oppressive regimes willing to go outside the law. ""It simply never happens that government regulation constrains the tools available to the real attackers,"" Ray says. ""The government of Syria was able to obtain sufficient Blue Coat man-in-the-middle TLS interception systems to use against their entire country, and Syria is one of the most heavily export-controlled regimes in the world."" The good news for researchers is that the Department of Commerce seems eager to keep the rule-making process as transparent as possible. A two-month comment period is rare for this kind of measure, and many similar trade agreements are adopted with no comment period at all. The fact that Commerce officials are soliciting comments so actively suggests they understand how complex the issues are, and are leaving the door open for a strong response from researchers. ""This is a point where the security community needs to engage in order to get a public policy that doesn't harm them,"" says Anderson. ""BIS needs feedback from the security community, and they're very clearly asking for it.""",0.39211948136680586,0.6078805186331941,0.507910072424174,912,5.3815789473684212,477,6.4591194968553456,0,0,"Policy & Law, US & World, Report"

For years they've encouraged their patrons to come in and gorge themselves at will, subtly implying that anyone who pays for food is an idiot. There've been rumors that this restaurant's been able to keep the buffet going by stealing food from competing restaurants, but most patrons don't care — and as the restaurant drives out its competition, or buys them out, eventually the objections die down. And then one day, seemingly out of nowhere, the restaurant announces a change in policy. The free buffet will still be there, but now they're offering Buffet Premium, and though for years they've mocked anyone who's ever considered paying for food, now they think it would be a great idea if their patrons would start paying a monthly fee to access slightly better meals.  The free buffet will still be there, but now they're offering Buffet Premium Pornhub Premium, just announced yesterday by the adult streaming site, is just as unlikely a business model. For years, its parent company MindGeek (formerly known as Manwin) has encouraged consumers to think of adult entertainment as a freely available commodity, something to be enjoyed at will on their network of ""tube sites"" (including, but not limited to PornHub, RedTube, XTube, and YouPorn). Over the years, MindGeek's been plagued by allegations that their freely distributed content is actually the pirated product of their competitors, but as they've amassed power in the industry — and bought up some of their loudest antagonists, like Digital Playground — many of the complaints have died down. And now, as they control much of the adult industry, MindGeek seems to have realized that — as their competitors have argued for years — giving everything away for free doesn't exactly pay. Pornhub Premium is essentially a Netflix-style site offering unlimited access to HD porn content for just $9.99 a month.  Though free, ad-supported websites are de rigeur across much of the internet, with everything from Facebook to The Verge providing content in exchange for impressions, running an entirely ad-supported adult website is a trickier proposition. Unlike mainstream companies, those who trade in porn have a fairly limited supply of potential advertisers — generally speaking, the only companies interested in advertising somewhere like Pornhub are other porn sites, adult dating sites, and sometimes sex toys. And unlike large companies with extensive advertising budgets that can be invested in large-scale branding campaigns that may not deliver immediate payoff, adult advertisers are often frugal, looking to spend small amounts and see an immediate return in sales — a difficult proposition, particularly given that Pornhub's properties have actively devalued the products of a number of their potential advertisers (if you can get it here for free, why pay for it elsewhere?). As the bottom falls out on ad-supported adult sites, it's easy to see why they'd want to explore a new source of revenue. But after years of the message that porn — like information — wants to be free, it's hard to see why, exactly, any Pornhub fans would want to pony up cash for their product. It's hard to see why, exactly, any Pornhub fans would want pony up cash for their product Granted, streaming services like Spotify, Hulu, and Netflix have shown that the right mixture of affordability and ease of access can convert even die-hard pirates into paying customers. But mainstream music, TV, and movies have something that sets them apart from pornography: daylong binges of The Vampire Diaries aside, there's no stigma attached to consuming any of them. Porn is still largely seen as the domain of perverts, which makes it that much harder to convince people to open their wallets for it. Sure, we might lose hours and hours to XXX clips, but paying for porn suddenly transforms someone into an actual consumer of adult media; and for those that have been getting their rocks off for free for years, actually putting money down for their smut feels like a step too far. Pornhub may argue that faster servers and HD content make their pay option more appealing. But for those that are willing to pay, faster servers and HD content have been available for years; if anything, the success of sites like Pornhub is proof that, when it comes to adult media, free trumps quality any day of the week. Notably, Pornhub isn't even the first to try out a Netflix-style streaming model: FyreTV, which debuted in 2008, has long offered a similar setup, which hasn't proven to be particularly popular. It's certainly possible that Pornhub will have better content, or pricing, or navigation, than its streaming predecessors, but will that actually be enough to make consumers interested? The success of sites like Pornhub is proof that free trumps quality If anything, the strongest argument for Pornhub Premium is this: unlike Spotify, or Hulu, or Netflix, Pornhub and MindGeek actually control a large amount of the free competition. Should it serve their financial interests, MindGeek can always turn off the tap at their tube sites, perhaps turning Pornhub Premium into the only way to access their content. But even though MindGeek controls much of the free content, they're hardly the only game in town — and, were they to end their free offerings, smut fans could always go to BitTorrent, or Tumblr, or WoodRocket (a legally produced free site which, full disclosure, I briefly worked for in 2014). The culture of free is far too established for any one company to fight, and, after all these years, it's strange to see one of the biggest champions of free porn trying.",0.5380837069853749,0.4619162930146251,0.27323609839708735,947,5.0549102428722277,465,6.1763440860215058,0,0,"Culture, Entertainment, Web, Editorial"

One year ago, the internet was watching a leaked test reel showing what a Deadpool movie might look like; now, pretty much exactly one year later, we're getting a first look at the real thing. And yeah, it looks as irreverent, vulgar, and funny as everyone hoped. It comes out in February.   It's good to see Blue Steel again. Ben Stiller is back in costume as Derek Zoolander, and it seems like he's having plenty of fun with it. This first teaser doesn't show much, but it should be enough to remind you what was so fun about this character in the first place. The movie comes out next February.   Empire became a surprise smash hit last year, and it's about to come back for season two. This trailer should give fans a solid idea of what's to come when it returns just over a month from now, on September 23rd.   In this trailer alone, Vin Diesel has an incredible flowing beard, wields a flaming sword, shoots a dream monster with a shotgun, is approached by a sick car, and literally says that he is afraid of nothing. Will this be the perfect movie, or has it gone too far? It's out October 23rd.   This is a nice surprise: Angelina Jolie wrote and directed a movie that seems to primarily star herself and Brad Pitt, and it looks like a gorgeous, quiet, and tense look at a couple's relationship while vacationing along a beautiful vista. It's out November 13th.   I'm pretty blown away with how gorgeous, thoughtful, and tense this looks. The Assassin is a martial arts film from Hou Hsiao-Hsien, who picked up the best director award at this year's Cannes Film Festival, and is about a woman who's sent to kill the man she was supposed to marry. There's no word on when it'll come out internationally, but it's supposed to start being released in China this month.   No one is really sure why the guy who made Independence Day is directing Stonewall, but what's done is done and, hey, it even looks like it could be pretty good. Stonewall is about the start of the gay rights movement and the famous riots at New York's Stonewall Inn. It'll be in theaters September 25th.   The Leftovers is kind of rebooting for its second season, and this trailer tries to make it clear what we're in for. The show is going to have to answer quickly whether this move is enough to keep it going. The premise has always been interesting, now it just has to follow through. Season two starts on October 4th.   Basically all you need to know about Vinyl: it's from Martin Scorsese and Mick Jagger, and it airs on HBO. If that doesn't sell you, maybe Vinyl's not for you. The show starts sometime next year.   If you've ever wondered why people go so crazy about sneakers, this movie may have your answer. Or, at the very least, it'll show you just how crazy for sneakers some people can get. The trailer for Sneakerheadz makes it seem like a fascinating look at a wildly enthusiastic culture. It appears to be in a small number of theaters right now, and it hits Vimeo on August 21st. (On a related note, if you're in New York City in the next couple months, there's a wonderful exhibit on sneaker culture at the Brooklyn Museum.)   Elle Fanning, Naomi Watts, and Susan Sarandon play a family in this drama about a grumpy dude who won't let his trans son begin to transition. About Ray looks like it may be a straightforward, warmhearted family drama, but it has a solid cast and it's nice to see more big actors starting to explore transgender stories. It's out September 18th.   Seventy years ago this week, the US dropped an atomic bomb on on Hiroshima that killed around 80,000 people. The BBC documentary Atomic: Living in Dread and Promise appears to take a haunting look back at the bomb's horrific destruction and what life was like after its fall. The film is supposed to use only archival footage, but it's scored with a new — and apparently powerful — soundtrack from Mogwai. It airs Saturday night.   Documentaries don't get much more timely than this. Peace Officer is a look at the militarization of police forces and the incredibly controversial killings that continue to come out of them. Be warned: there's some very graphic footage in here. The film starts out in a small number of theaters next month.   Here's the thing: Blunt Talk doesn't have to be that good. At the end of the day, it's still about Patrick Stewart being crazy high, ridiculous, and destructive. It should be at least a little fun. It starts on Starz August 22nd.   I'm happy to shamelessly express my love for everything happening in this trailer. It's Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach — you know what to expect. It's out next weekend.

In his efforts to find the egg, the lead character Parzival has to go through a series of challenges, all of which riff directly on '80s pop culture movies, TV shows, music, and video games. (The Back to the Future series, which Spielberg produced, also plays a minor role.) The script for Ready Player One was written by Zak Penn, a writer that's worked on huge films like the X-Men movies and The Avengers, with projects like Pacific Rim 2 and one of the new Transformers films also on his plate.",0.6436944664058724,0.35630553359412764,0.7536513973003003,255,4.6705882352941179,167,5.3353293413173652,0,0,"Culture, Entertainment, Film"

I’m sitting at a train station right now, foregoing nourishment and hydration just to write these words of joy. Think back to your happiest first date and you’ll have a good idea of how I feel after my first time playing Battleborn. This game is just thrilling. Mayhem good enough to make Tyler Durden proud Battleborn is a team-based first-person shooter developed by the deranged minds behind the Borderlands series. It plays very much like Borderlands, which makes it an immediate pick-up-and-frag experience, but it has a great deal of extra depth and variety. The cast of 25 heroes starts with a conventional rifle-wielding soldier — his name's Oscar Mike and he was the one I played my way through the Gamescom level with — but quickly expands to include characters you wouldn't expect to find in an FPS, such as the katana-wielding Rath and the ""unhinged chaos witch"" Orendi. Both of them were on my team of five, and the fact that I remember their names in spite of not actually controlling them should tell you a lot about how immersive the game is and how compelling the heroes are. And even my seemingly boring soldier had an invisibility cloak and the capability to call in an air strike. The controls of Battleborn are supremely well designed. I played it on the Xbox One and very quickly learned all the ways in which my hero could assert his status as a badass. By comparison, there have been games here at Gamescom that were basically unplayable for anyone without a full training manual. Battleborn is just logical and intuitive, and everything you do is beautifully and brightly animated, giving useful visual cues to keep you going without stumbling (too much). The accessibility of this game is hugely important, since the whole premise here is to have unthinking, maniacal fun. Battleborn splices genres in a refreshing, deeply satisfying way When I first heard that Battleborn would include MOBA (Multiplayer Online Battle Arena) elements, I was immediately skeptical about how they would be integrated. First of all, traditional MOBAs like League of Legends and Dota 2 just don't work on consoles, which is mostly down to their need for a full keyboard and mouse. These are not gamepad-friendly games, and their strategic upgrades through the course of a match don't mesh easily with the frenetic pace of a game like Borderlands (which is the foundation upon which Battleborn is built). But Gearbox Software, the makers of Battleborn, have quashed those reservations completely. They've created a gradual hero augmentation system that's very similar to the way you level up a MOBA hero, and they've made the upgrade choices extremely quick and easy. I was able to upgrade Oscar Mike's agility in less time than it took him to reload.  Perhaps I should have expected this. I have spent many countless hours inside both Borderlands and Dota 2, so the combination of their best aspects into an immediate, delightful, team-based shooter seems like it would obviously find favor with me. But pulling that premise off successfully is so much trickier than it sounds, and it's the thing that's keeping me buzzing with excitement about this new game. Battleborn will have both the single-player, narrative-driven (mis)adventures of Borderlands and the team-based deathmatches that make Dota so hopelessly addictive. My experience with fellow Gamescom attendees showed many of the cooperative joys of Battleborn — such as reviving one teammate while another puts out covering fire behind us — but it didn't let us take on another team of humans. The full roster of heroes and their abilities are among the details that are yet to be revealed about Battleborn. I'll be keeping close track of them and everything else about this game in the build-up to its release, which is scheduled for February 9th next year on PC, Xbox One, and PS4.

Created back in 1961, Mister Fantastic, the Invisible Woman, the Human Torch, and the Thing were Marvel Comic’s first great superhero team, predating the Avengers by two whole years. They’re the foundation, paving the way for icons like Spider-Man and the X-Men in pop culture. So it’s incredible that, despite the series’ pedigree, there has never, ever been a good Fantastic Four movie. One completed in 1994 never saw theatrical release. Two more in the mid-2000s were both critical failures. In 2015, Marvel’s “First Family” is ready to try again. Director Josh Trank takes the team in a new direction for the big screen this year, offering up a darker origin story that’s more mad-science-gone-wrong thriller than comic book blockbuster. Trank already managed a subtle but effective deconstruction of the superhero genre with Chronicle in 2012 by grounding his characters in the ordinary, so when he took the reins for Fantastic Four, it was easy to assume his approach would breathe new life into the franchise. But stepping out of the shadow of the past has been difficult, and the film’s troubled production, hampered by reshoots and marketing problems, has been well documented. Despite all the heartache, does Fantastic Four finally succeed where others have failed? I wish I could say it does. Unfortunately, despite the best efforts of its cast, Fantastic Four fails to come together because Trank seems so unwilling to make anything resembling a Marvel superhero movie. And that would be fine, if not for the fact that it’s not very clear what he does want to make. The movie begins in on Long Island in 2007, where a grade school-aged Reed Richards shares with his class his dream of being the first person to master teleportation. It’s a quiet scene that introduces us to Reed’s world and his ambitions, and we learn quickly that he’s uniquely gifted. He and his best friend Ben Grimm actually manage to build that teleporter out of spare parts in his garage, and when they manage to actually teleport a toy car, an aghast Ben says, ""Reed, you’re insane."" It’s then that we realize that this Richards boy is both a genius and potentially dangerous. This, then, is Reed’s movie more than any other character’s, and that’s Fantastic Four’s first problem. Fast forward to the present day, and Reed (now played by Miles Teller) is still working on perfecting that teleporter with Ben (Jamie Bell). He’s still a genius. He still wants to change the world. And, on his own, he’s not especially interesting. The movie gives him a personality only as it relates to his being a solitary intellectual devoted to bettering mankind, without offering much depth beyond that. It even goes out of its way to liken him to Jules Verne’s Captain Nemo, but we never see him reach for Nemo’s intensity. Teller does manage to bring some quirky, affable charm to the role, but there’s a drabness about the character that Teller never overcomes. That same drabness pervades much of the movie. After Reed and Ben meet Dr. Franklin Storm (Reg. E. Cathey) and his daughter Sue Storm (Kate Mara) at a high school demonstration of their teleporter, the pair are invited to continue their work at the Baxter Foundation, a government-sponsored think tank. From there, a lengthy portion of the movie is spent within Baxter’s monotonous bluish-gray interior, introducing the remaining core characters and pointing them toward the fateful accident that gives them their fantastic powers. There’s Johnny Storm (Michael B. Jordan), Dr. Storm’s hothead son who loves fast cars. Then there’s Victor von Doom (Toby Kebbell), a rebellious hacker with a superiority complex who also managed to create a teleporter but fell short of Reed’s breakthrough.  And from there, Trank proceeds to trap them inside to stare at computers and build equipment for what feels like half the movie. In spite of that, though, the actors’ performances and chemistry actually make the film somewhat engaging, especially where Jordan and Kebbell are concerned. Reed has an easy rapport with Ben, and develops a funny, ""I’m the nerd of the group"" relationship with the Storm siblings. Meanwhile, he, Victor, and Sue fall into the kind of love triangle that’s never overt but instead simmers beneath the surface. Even though every character is just as underwritten as Reed is — they each want to do cool things for mostly vague, undefined reasons — the real fireworks happen in the character moments, and that’s the most welcome improvement from the more cartoonish portrayals of previous outings. There is one singularly great scene in Fantastic Four, shortly after the defining accident, in which we see each of the characters completely transformed: Reed’s body stretches; Johnny is on fire; Sue is phasing in and out of visibility; and poor Ben is a rock monster, crying out for help. It’s genuinely startling, its grotesqueness approaching body horror. At that point, even after all the table setting, it seems as if the film is finally ready to take off. Instead, the cast retreats back to yet another research facility, this time to figure out how to reverse the effects of the accident. And from that point on it’s clear that Trank’s not out to convey any sense of joy or wonder. It turns out that main element he decided to port in from Chronicle was that film’s organic sensibility, which comes off as dull and sullen in this context. He puts smart people in a room with a common goal and lets them make things. And when things go wrong, he forces them to try to unmake them. There’s action, sure. The Thing throws a tank and the Human Torch throws fireballs. But many of these scenes are brief or shot from a distance. Trank clearly wants us to care more about the people than their powers. They’ve all gone through a traumatic experience, and being a hero is hard. But in a Marvel superhero movie reboot, where the mythology is established and a certain amount of spectacle is expected, steering in the opposite direction winds up crippling the entire enterprise. Where a Cronenberg film could afford to take a slow-burn tack, taking that approach with a Marvel movie drains the fun right out of things. After all this build up, the finale should be a welcome reprieve. Victor, now super-powerful and calling himself Doom, returns and sets out to destroy Earth. The Fantastic Four must suddenly band together to save the world. The oddest thing about all this is that, for a movie that took so much time getting to the superheroics, the final battle feels rushed, maybe even studio-mandated. Punches are thrown, the Thing shouts, ""It’s clobberin’ time!"" and Doom is defeated. It starts and ends so quickly, and is so out of step with all the development that came before it that one wonders if Trank was even behind the camera for the scene. Reed isn’t the deliberate man of science we’ve been watching for hours. He’s suddenly someone who can stretch to dodge flying debris and energy blasts. It makes so little sense that you’re left asking what happened? As in what happened to this movie that had so much potential? There’s a moment in 2005’s Fantastic Four that, in hindsight, exemplifies this reboot’s core problem. There’s a scene where a pre-Captain America Chris Evans rides his motorcycle over a ramp for a live crowd. He transforms into the Human Torch mid-jump, melting his gear in the process. But when he reveals his Fantastic Four outfit, the crowd goes wild. It’s a fun scene, and that kind of fun is completely missing in this year’s version. That first film is still a bad movie, but 2015’s Fantastic Four is lifeless, and that somehow hurts more. Trank had an interesting conceit, but that conceit would have worked much better in a different movie. Here, it falls completely flat. Marvel’s First Family deserves better.",0.7749676345668111,0.22503236543318894,0.47663259196566204,1344,4.9776785714285712,701,6.2524964336661908,0,8,"Culture, Entertainment, Movie Review"

The following night, ticket in hand, she attended that taping. Here's what she saw at the final, emotional #JonVoyage. I asked Jon Stewart his final question from an audience member. When Stewart's eyes roamed over the crowd, I just had this feeling that he'd land on me. And when they did, I took a breath and began my carefully crafted, very premeditated question, which I'd intended to begin by thanking him for what he's done for my people. Comedy people, that is. ""I work for UCB,"" I said, preparing to thank him for giving so many Upright Citizens Brigade performers and writers jobs over the past 16 years. But before I could, he was thanking us. ""We owe you guys a debt of gratitude for all the great people you've sent us over the years,"" he said. Given the opportunity for a follow-up question, I asked him if, with all the new time on his hands, if he'd come be the monologist at our long-running weekly improv show Asssscat. ""No, fuck that shit,"" he fired quickly, before smiling and saying he'd love to. And with a whirl of his arm like a general calling his troops to charge, he starts the show. I think tomorrow I'll ask for a raise. Stewart chafed against the suggestion that he was a newsman Among my comedy friends and colleagues, The Daily Show has been not only a dream job to reach for, but also a basic touchstone for anyone working on topical material. If we're talking about a ""desk piece"" in a sketch class, we're thinking about Jon Stewart's desk. It's impossible to overstate the influence TDS has had on a generation of comedians coming of age in the era of the 24-hour news cycle and the instantaneous transfer of information online. The grit and endurance of getting a show on the air every night, not to mention one that tackles events that occurred less than a day ago, makes writing that new 10 minutes of stand-up seem a lot less Herculean in comparison. Week after week, it's like Stewart was saying to us, ""Come on, I'm making economic collapse funny. You can work harder."" Jon Stewart, Stephen Colbert, and John Oliver have chafed against the suggestion that many people get their news from their shows. They'll always be comedians first, and reject the responsibility, the authority, and the hubris of being ""newsmen."" They don't frame their work as anything more than making people laugh. But Jon Stewart's legacy at TDS isn't that he did ""more than comedy."" It's that comedy is more. Laughter is healing, but it's also surprising, condemning, inciting, and sometimes infuriating. It makes change in the world. Stewart isn't the first comedian to have an impact on the political landscape, but his consistent presence in American culture has given a new shape to comedy's identity. We recognize its power in new ways. Stewart retreated to a corner, wiping his eyes Jon's final monologue ended with a plea. He urged us to be vigilant of bullshit, and tweaked a classic homeland security catchphrase: if we smell something, say something. He may be passing The Daily Show on to its new host Trevor Noah in September, but he's passing the torch of bullshit-detection to all of us right now. As Bruce Springsteen launched into ""Land of Hopes and Dreams"" for the closing act, Stewart could be seen returning to his wife and kids and retreating into a corner, wiping his eyes. Throughout the night he's been visibly holding back a well of emotion, puffing out his cheeks with sighs and fanning his face during commercial breaks. When the band shifted into ""Born to Run,"" he ran out with his family to the stage, dancing at the center of a growing cluster of bodies, most of whom have been onstage or backstage earlier that night, some famous, some not. Comedy people. My people. Thanks for starting the cluster, Jon. As Stephen Colbert said tonight, we're all better for knowing you — if not better comedians, then better bullshit-sniffers.

Ubisoft has brought Rainbow Six Siege and the all-new For Honor for gamers to try out in Cologne, while DICE used the show to debut a massive 20-player dogfight mode in Star Wars: Battlefront. Blizzard's Heroes of the Storm has been everywhere too, but it's another title from the same company that I want to talk about today: Overwatch. It, along with Gearbox Software's Battleborn, is establishing a new category of team-based shooter games, one where violence and gore are de-emphasized in favor of accessibility and cooperative fun. A MOBA for FPS fans, an FPS for MOBA fans Anyone who's ever played Team Fortress 2 will find both of these new games familiar, and they do indeed owe a measure of creative debt to Valve's enduringly popular team shooter. But you can't have a class of games made up of just one, and it's only now that TF2 is finding more games willing to explore its quirky mix of cartoony visuals, frenetic action, and exaggerated weaponry. The typical definition of a first-person shooter (FPS) game immediately brings to mind the Call of Duty series, where realism is prized and storylines revolve around plausible near-future scenarios. You are a soldier with a rifle, and though the specifics of what you and the rifle can do might change, the essence of gritty warfare is generally right at the heart of the game. Big publishers like Blizzard and 2K Games, which is responsible for Battleborn's release, are now investing their time and effort into creating games that take a different approach.  Because FPS games thrust the player directly into the body of the controlled character, they immediately feel more intimate. That's what makes them so exciting and captivating, but it's also what puts off many players who don't fancy spending their afternoon enjoying a first-person view of some bleak dystopia filled with dying screams and smoking shotgun shells. Sometimes, people just want a lighthearted blast-'em-up that doesn't make them feel like homicidal maniacs, and that's where Battleborn and Overwatch come in. They both blend the familiarity and immediacy of first-person shooters with the superheroic aspects of third-person team-based games like Heroes of the Storm. HotS is the newest prominent name in the class of multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) games that is headed up by League of Legends and Dota 2. It's because of the wild popularity and runaway commercial success of those games that we're now getting titles like Battleborn, Overwatch, and the Xbox One-bound Gigantic. Not every shooting game has to make the player feel like a homicidal maniac Both Battleborn and Overwatch offer highly stylized playable characters with diverse abilities and roles. MOBA veterans will find themselves at home with Battleborn's hero leveling system, which lets you progressively upgrade and augment your hero as you make your way through a mission or a fight. It's probably improper to label these new games as FPS titles, given how much else each player can do beyond merely shooting. They are certainly a hybrid.  These games are fantastic, in both their setting and gameplay While they share a number of qualities, Battleborn and Overwatch have their differences as well. The latter game retains a greater sense of realism; it still feels like a stylized reality as opposed to a complete other world. Battleborn, on the other hand, is just gleeful in casting off the chains of our world and exploring visual and mechanical caricatures. An Overwatch hero, even one with teleportation abilities, feels much more human than a Battleborn character. Real-world physics are more closely adhered to in Overwatch, which may appeal to fans of traditional FPS that don't want to completely abandon their heritage. Personally, I have fallen in love with the design and gameplay of Battleborn: it's instantly accessible and fun, and its heroes' superhuman litheness means there's rarely a pause in the action. Basically, I feel like Battleborn is the better game, and its fantastic elements serve to augment rather than undermine the pacing and joy of the gameplay. My impressions of the two games at Gamescom have left me excited for the future of shooter games. I've heeded many Calls of Duty in my time, and was once deeply addicted to Rainbow Six 3: Raven Shield, but have felt the need for something truly different to diversify the genre. I like what I'm seeing from Blizzard and Gearbox this year, even without knowing the full rosters of characters and abilities that their new games will offer. The potential is clearly there and, in the case of Battleborn, the quality and fun of the gameplay are beyond question. Maybe I'll reach a similarly glowing conclusion about Overwatch once I've had more time to accustom myself to its heroes and learn the nuance of what they can do. I'm looking forward to finding out.",-1,-1,-1,825,5.0290909090909093,467,6.1113490364025695,0,0,"Culture, Entertainment, Gaming, Gamescom , Hands-on"
