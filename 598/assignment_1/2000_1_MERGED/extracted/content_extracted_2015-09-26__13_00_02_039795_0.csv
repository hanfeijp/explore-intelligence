The mysterious and diverse world of bacteria just got its very own expansion pack. A total of 35 new groups, or phyla, of bacteria have been discovered in groundwater in Rifle, Colorado. The finding will likely add a bunch of new species to the tree of life — species that are quite different from other bacteria, scientists note. But here's what's really remarkable: the number of new bacterial groups is almost the same as the number of known animal phyla on Earth. We were always outnumbered, but you still might want to let the magnitude of this discovery sink in.  ""A substantial modification of the tree of life."" The number of bacterial groups discovered represent about 15 percent of the total number of bacteria that we’ve documented so far, says Jill Banfield, a geomicrobiologist at the University of California-Berkeley and a co-author of the study, published today in Nature. This ""represents a substantial modification of the tree of life."" In the study, researchers used very fine filters to capture microorganisms in groundwater at a remediation site in Rifle, Colorado. The filters' holes were so fine that the scientists were able to capture bacteria that are about 400 nanometers across — microorganisms that normally pass through the kinds of filters we use to sterilize water. They ""evaded more than 130 years of microbial cultivation studies."" Then, the scientists analyzed the samples. Thanks to the DNA they gathered, they found brand-new genomes — eight complete and 789 near-complete. But the 797 new genomes don't necessarily mean that many new species. ""Each genome comes from one organism, but some of the genomes are so close to each other that you probably wouldn’t say that they were different bacteria,"" Banfield says. Still, the diversity uncovered by the researchers is substantial, especially if you think about how long these organisms have gone unnoticed. ""These [lineages] evaded more than 130 years of microbial cultivation studies,"" says Brian Hedlund, a microbiologist at the University of Nevada-Las Vegas, who didn’t participate in the study. ""I think this work is incredibly exciting.""   Credit: Banfield group graphic Banfield and her team had suspected they might find new bacteria — but they weren't expecting this level of diversity. And the fact that these organisms are so different from other known species is intriguing. The bacteria have very small genomes and unusual genetic features, Banfield says. They also seem to lack the kinds of metabolic pathways that are usually required for independent growth, meaning that they need the help of other bacteria to survive. But the researchers don't know much more than that at the moment; characterizing these organisms, as well as their relationships with other bacteria, will take some time. ""Their genomes remain enigmatic."" ""Because these organisms are unusual and very distantly related to the organisms that have been studied in the lab, a large fraction of the genes encoded by their genomes remain enigmatic,"" Banfield says. ""The paper provided a very good accounting of genes that may be important for the physiology of these organisms,"" Hedlund says, ""but in reality we have a long way to go before we will deeply understand the nature of these microorganisms, how they make a living, how they impact their symbionts, and their ecosystem more broadly.""",0.5423505654914952,0.4576494345085048,0.17370544586083014,553,5.1971066907775771,293,6.2150170648464167,0,2,"Science, Report"

It probably wasn’t going to happen anytime soon, she said, but when it did, she knew what she wanted her family to do with her body: compost it. Earlier this year, Seidel found out about the Urban Death Project — a proposed system that would turn bodies of the dead into compost — and knew instantly it was how she wanted to go out. “It took a nanosecond for me to make that decision,” Seidel said. “My brain was probably already working in that direction.” Seidel, an avid gardener who lives in Seattle, said she’s recently been drawn to the idea of green burials, and the Urban Death Project felt like an intimate, even spiritual way to return to the earth. So she donated $2,500 to the project’s Kickstarter campaign, which secured her a space in the ""core"": a multi-story vault designed to sit at the center of every Urban Death facility. The design is just a concept for now, but it will work something like this: Bodies of the dead will be carried to the top level of the core — which can hold several bodies at once — where they will be covered in wood chips. As each stage in the composting process is completed, the bodies will move down a level until they have completely decomposed. The resulting material will then be screened for non-biodegradable objects, like titanium hips or gold teeth, and cured before being handed off to the families. The Urban Death Project is the brainchild of Seidel's fellow Seattle resident and architect Katrina Spade, who was inspired to design the system while watching her children play one day two years ago. ""I had this one moment one day where I was watching them and I thought, 'Oh it's so great how fast these babies are growing,'"" she said. ""And then I realized that we're all growing at the same rate and one day I was going to die."" Spade says the Urban Death Project allows people to embrace their eventual return to Earth's organic ebb and flow. ""We're part of the natural ecosystem now, and when we die, we're quite literally turning back into other parts of the world. We're turning into soil, trees, plant life eaten by animals,"" she said. ""It's not just symbolic, it's actually happening."" The project surpassed its Kickstarter funding goal of $75,000 in May, and now the biggest hurdle left is legislation. While farmers have been composting livestock for years, human composting has no legal precedent. Spade says she's working with several legislators to discuss regulation, and is confident the process will be mostly administrative. ""I don't think it's going to be a terrible legal battle,"" she said. What might take longer to change, however, is Americans’ perception of unconventional burials. ""For people that fear death, traditional burial and cremation are easier to take. You don’t have to come face to face with the mortality of our bodies,"" Seidel said. ""If you embalm somebody, you have a funeral for them, they look very nice in their casket. And then you don’t see them again. You can pretend they’re going to look that way forever."" Americans now have more options than ever when it comes to deciding what happens to their bodies after they die, but burial and cremation still lead the pack by a long shot. Conventional burial is expected to account for 45.8 percent of end-of-life choices in 2015, while the projected cremation rate is 48.2 percent, according to the National Funeral Directors Association. And the number of people choosing cremation in the US continues to increase year after year. In 1985, cremation accounted for just 14.9 percent of final dispositions, and by 2020, that number is expected to rise to 55 percent, according to the Cremation Association of North America. Because people have migrated to cities in great numbers over the last century, some urban cemeteries are running out of room. Around the world, sufficient burial space is becoming increasingly scarce. A 2013 study suggested nearly half of the cemeteries in England could fill up entirely in the next two decades, according to the BBC. And, as more and more people begin to realize the impact their death can have on the earth, burial methods that don't contribute to ecological destruction start to look more appealing. Economic factors also play a role here. End-of-life options are more expensive than they’ve ever been. In the 1960s, the average cost of a funeral was $708; in 2012, it was $7,045. Combined with crematory revenue, funeral home revenue is expected to grow to $17.2 billion by 2019, according to the National Funeral Directors Association. People seem to be willing to pay more for customization (the highest end of which can reach tens of thousands of dollars), or they'll go simple and pay less hoping to avoid any kind of spectacle. Memorials for the dead can be traced back to ancient times, but death used to be a much simpler matter. Before the advent of the funeral home at the turn of the 20th century, most burials occurred in the home. Families would bathe, clothe, and bury their loved ones on their own property. What many people today consider to be a pretty standard burial practice — embalming the dead, choosing a casket — didn’t really emerge until the Civil War. Army doctors dealing with hundreds of dead soldiers who were miles away from home needed a way to preserve bodies until their families could see them. Families who could afford the expense would have their sons’ bodies embalmed and shipped across state lines. One of the most elaborate embalmings in American history goes to the 16th president. After Abraham Lincoln was assassinated in 1865, his body was sent on a cross-country tour, from DC to Illinois, making stops in major cities along the way. Embalmers tried to make him look, well, alive, so mourners could remember him in an appealing light. By the turn of the century, the funeral industry was booming. Of course, it helped that the thing contributing most to that growth was inevitable: death. Then, in 1963, Jessica Mitford’s exposé The American Way of Death challenged the way many people thought about the country’s elaborate burial process. Since when had funerals become as extravagant as weddings? Mitford argued that the funeral industry managed to convince the public of two things in order to solidify its place in American afterlife: 1) that modern day funeral practices were founded in ""American tradition"" and 2) that elaborate, sophisticated funerals were really just another extension of what Americans wanted in life. ""Gradually, almost imperceptibly, over the years the funeral men have constructed their own grotesque cloud-cuckoo-land where the trappings of Gracious Living are transformed, as in a nightmare, into the trappings of Gracious Dying,"" she wrote. Death, it seemed, had become an extravagance. The funeral industry is nearly a century old, and though its revenue stream isn’t in any danger, it’s still had to adapt with the times. The Urban Death Project is just one of several alternatives for people looking for options outside of cremation and in-ground burial. Although some aspects of the project might sound a little otherworldly, the tenets of the Urban Death Project are really just an extension of the practice of ""green burials."" Green burials are pretty much exactly what they sound like, but there are different levels of ""green."" People can choose to forego embalming fluid, use a shroud or biodegradable casket, and (depending on state laws) choose to have a home burial or be buried in a green-certified cemetery. With conventional burials, nearly 7 million gallons of embalming fluid (made mostly of formaldehyde, a known carcinogen) are buried in the soil each year. While cremation uses fewer resources than standard burials, it still produces carbon emissions that contribute to the depletion of the Earth’s ozone layer. Green burial prices vary, but if a person foregoes embalming or engraved headstones, the funeral can cost just a few hundred dollars. Samuel Bar, development of product standards at the Green Burial Council, says the biggest draw of green burials is their simplicity. ""I hear so often that people want this to be simple,"" he said. ""They don’t want to be gawked at. They don’t want the facade of being embalmed and stared at in a casket."" The lure of simplicity might sound like an echo of Grace Siedel, who said that people don’t want to think too much about what happens after they die. But other alternative burial options suggest some people do want to think about it — and they want to think about it in a way that relates very personally to their own lives. Even in death, Americans look for a way to claim their individuality. Mitford called ""Gracious Dying"" a ""huge, macabre, and expensive joke,"" and though funerals in America are often huge and expensive (and maybe a little macabre) they're no joke. People — now more than ever it seems — are seriously looking for burial options that reflect their lives. If a woman spends a lifetime concerned about her environmental impact, why would she abandon those concerns in death? If a man spends thousands of dollars on a particular hobby, why shouldn't that hobby be memorialized at his funeral?   Dave Kostick’s wife told him before she died that she would haunt him if he didn’t do one thing: put her cremated remains in a coral reef. ""She said, ‘If I die before you, that is what I want to do — I want to be swimming with the fish,’"" Kostick said. This request might sound like something out of a noir detective film, but it’s actually a service provided by Eternal Reefs, one of a growing number of companies that offer burial options outside the norm. Eternal Reefs evolved from the Reef Ball Development Group, a company founded by Don Brawley and Todd Barber that had been creating artificial reefs since the 1980s.  The company builds replicas of natural reef formations with the hope of helping to stabilize endangered reef systems around the world. The Reef Balls are composed of a specialized concrete that's mixed to be as close to neutral as possible, with a textured shell that provides a habitat for marine life. Intrigued by the popularity of the Reef Balls in the '80s, Brawley’s father-in-law had another idea: what about mixing his cremated remains into a reef? Because the ash from cremations has the same composition as potash — a main ingredient in cement — Brawley was able to get FDA approval to do it. Today, the company's largest Reef Ball can cost up to $6,995. Brawley says when the company first began putting human remains into artificial reefs, people were skeptical. ""People used to call, and we’d have to explain the entire process,"" he said. ""Now people call up and say, 'This is what my family member wanted, what do I need to do?' We’ve gotten past the novelty factor.""   Novelty was a roadblock for another unusual burial service: the memorial spaceflight company Celestis. Celestis allows humans to travel into space — after they've died, of course. Although it sounds futuristic, Celestis has actually been around since the early 1980s. It was formed by Charles M. Chafer, a man who has worked in the space industry for decades. The company offers four kinds of spaceflight: Earth Ride, in which the spacecraft goes into space and returns; Earth Orbit, in which the spacecraft orbits the Earth for several months to several years; a Moon Orbit; and the $12,500 Voyager ride, which is a deep-space mission that does not return to Earth. The process is simple: several small capsules packed with cremated remains are placed aboard a single commercial rocket that's already headed to space. The first Celestis launch in 1997 contained the remains of LSD advocate Timothy Leary and Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry. Chafer says there are generally two kinds of people who choose Celestis: people who love space and people who love adventure. ""One of our customers said, 'I just went out and looked in the night sky and knew that was where I belonged,'"" Chafer said, ""so they’re not particularly interested in the spacecraft or that kind of stuff, but more of a universal consciousness approach."" But Mitchell Thomas' father (also named Mitchell Thomas) would probably fall into that first category of people: the space enthusiasts. Thomas was a rocket scientist, who, according to his son, was capable of sorting through complex problems that had other scientists stumped for days. And space was an innately comfortable subject for him. ""When I was a kid, [my father] used to hold me in his arms and we would look up at the stars, and he would tell me which ones are the stars and which are the planets and how they changed throughout the years,"" Mitchell said. ""His love for space wasn't comparable to anyone else's."" When the company his father worked for, the space technology firm L’garde, offered to put his father's ashes on a Celestis flight, Thomas said the decision was easy. ""His whole life he loved aerospace, and he would’ve loved to go into space,"" Thomas said. Space flight and sea burial aren't the only options out there. Resomation, or alkaline hydrolysis, is considered a more ecologically sound alternative to cremation. During resomation, a body is placed in a silk bag, submerged in a mixture of water and lye, and then heated at high pressure. The process doesn't create the high levels of greenhouse gases produced by flame cremation, but it's been slow to catch on. Alkaline hydrolosis wasn’t offered in the US until 2011, and it’s currently only legal in seven states. Or, there's the roaming Body Worlds exhibition, which accepts full body donations after death. It's similar to donating your body to medical researchers, but Body Worlds halts the natural process of decomposition. Bodies in the exhibition are preserved through the process of plastination, where fat and water are dissolved and exchanged for a reactive polymer like silicone rubber. After the exchange process, known somewhat unpleasantly as ""forced impregnation,"" the body is locked into a desired position using wires, clamps, and foam blocks. And for those who believe death is just a road bump on the path to an infinite lifespan, cryonics is available. It's the process of preserving bodies with the intention of one day bringing them back to life. People who are ""legally dead"" but not long dead, are cooled with liquid nitrogen to essentially stop the process of decay. The current minimum fee for preserving your body in the interim between life and more life is $28,000, according to the Cryonics Institute. That price is one reason many of the people who have been cryonically frozen have been wealthy celebrities like Red Sox baseball player Ted Williams, who only froze his head. Walt Disney reportedly wanted to be cryogenically preserved, but his family didn't go for it. Because we can't bring people back to life yet, there's no way to know if cryogenics actually works, and the technology sometimes fumbles. In 2006, ""France's best preserved corpses"" prematurely thawed due to a freezer malfunction. Although Jessica Mitford might argue that companies like Celestis and Eternal Reefs are just extensions of the exploitative funeral industry, the people behind those companies would disagree. Don Brawley says more personalized burial options are an inevitable sign of the times. ""I think we’re moving away from the conventional burial scenario because it used to be that people were born and died in the same little town,"" Brawley said. ""It’s not like that anymore."" Despite the fact that customized burials are becoming increasingly popular, Katrina Spade sees the advent of new options as a sign Americans are moving away from the idea of their special snowflake-ness. ""I think we have this very American cultural desire to have our individuality preserved forever, which is reflected in how we bury people,"" she said. ""I think people are coming to terms with the fact that we're part of something grander, and they're ready to embrace that.""",0.3562480820509933,0.6437519179490068,0.8553052237683797,2718,4.9665194996320823,1206,6.4278606965174125,0,12,"Culture, Science, Report"

Before you watch the video yourself, I should warn you that this is Good YouTube. This is real deal, the raw shit, the sticky icky. It's a direct window into someone else's life through which you will be dragged to watch in childish awe as strangers you've never met pet their fat pigs and make homemade sauerkraut. Viewers of a certain mindset may even be tempted to quit their job and move to the country. Now, I know most people's definition of Good YouTube is more often cute animals or well-timed pratfalls, but I think it's most meaningful as a sort of low-level, long-term escapism. Finding some Good YouTube isn't like watching a film or reading a book, but instead, it's like peering occasionally and affectionately into someone else's experience of the world. It's a magic porthole that you keep in your house and idly gaze into when you're brushing your teeth or washing the dishes. from smoking your own mackerel to making a fox trap out of a shopping trolley WayOutWest offers exactly this, with its videos (views mostly in the low thousands, a couple breaking through the 150K marker) covering all manner of farmyard chores, from smoking your own mackerel to making a fox trap out of a shopping trolley. Some are narrated in quiet tones by a gently accented woman, some by a gently accented man. Others are silent apart from background noises of animals and machinery, with subtitles in each one explaining what's going on. The information itself might not be directly useful (e.g. How To Make Steel Cog Wheels Without A Metal Lathe, 2,723 views), but as you watch the videos you pick up clues about the couple making them: about their day-to-day lives, their annual rounders match with friends, their love for their dogs. There's no hardcore exposition, no baring of thoughts and feeling as with YouTube's best-known vloggers. Instead, the whole channel just gently hums with the low-key vibrations of someone else's life.  It's fair to say that my enjoyment of WayOutWest includes a good amount of bog-standard authenticity tourism. I live in London and although I grew up in the countryside and have relatives who farm, it's unlikely I'll leave the city anytime soon to take up my plough and shovel (more like life on the content farm amirite?). But I think there's still something inescapably internet-y about how video channels like this present themselves and worm their way into our interests. It's the same way we can see a blog or a social media profile and automatically intuit the character of the human behind it — that automatic transference of humanity that means brands can be your friend on Twitter. I think people who have grown up on and around the internet are really good at reading these sorts of background-level semiotics, using their skills to not only interpret corporate content like adverts and trailers, but also the architecture of internet personhood; everything from someone's choice of profile picture to their use (or lack thereof) of txt talk and punctuation. These sorts of interpretations add depth and meaning to what we absorb online the same way that things like sentence structure and vocabulary articulate character in a novel. more persuasively human than television This means that the format of WayOutWest — a YouTube channel — is far more persuasively human than if the same footage appeared on TV. We know that the TV is a machine that turns people into content, and although the internet unquestionably does the same, it's more subtle about it, and when people have control over their own platform this person-to-person communication feels more immediate. The cinematographic cues of WayOutWest's videos all add to this. The hip-shot footage, the hand-drawn intro sequence, that time the dogs nearly knocked over the tripod — they all compound the feeling of watching real life in 5 minute clips. It also helps, of course, that the couple running WayOutWest seem like genuinely nice people who care about each other and enjoy making their videos.

As you might have guessed from the photo above, it's now ""loose tweets destroy fleets."" The advice is a higher-tech version of the general best practices for keeping secrets. ""As social media keeps evolving and there’s more and more avenues to let your friends and family know what you are up to, those same avenues can be used by ISIS sympathizers, ‘lone wolves,’ to track down and hurt our military members outside the safety of the base,"" warns AFCENT Force Protection chief Capt.

""Keeping quiet about operational information is vital to ensure military members stay safe on a daily basis."" Social media, including Twitter, is indeed becoming an information battlefield, from ISIS propaganda to American counter-trolling operations. And the World War II slogan has inspired any number of parodies already. But the really pertinent point here is that this particular one is fundamentally syntactically incorrect. It completely breaks the four-syllable da DUM da DUM cadence that made ""loose lips sink ships"" so memorable. The non-military parody (like other, similar jokes) uses the far superior ""loose tweets sink fleets,"" which is probably technically wrong for airplanes. But if it was good enough for the Air Force 920th Rescue Wing to use back in 2012, there's no reason to ruin a good thing now — even if the new one admittedly has a cooler poster.

That’s why the government suggests having a three-day supply of essentials — aka a bug-out bag — on hand. Especially if you live in an area that’s due to be completely crippled by a devastating earthquake that will snap your state as if it were a Slim Jim. You can tell a lot about a person by what’s in their bug-out bag. For some, it might be a pistol and plenty of ammo; for other MacGyver types, a Leatherman and a can-do attitude will do just fine. And you probably know at least one person who will have stashed away some booze and barbiturates. Booze and barbiturates But whatever your predilections, whether faced with an earthquake, hurricane, or any other shit hits the fan (SHTF) scenario, everyone needs to cover the basics: food, water, shelter, gas mask, sniper rifle … okay, maybe not those last two. The first thing you need is the bag. Although you might want to hold off buying the bag until you’ve got your other essentials together, start out with an idea of what kind of container you want to carry your stuff in. You want your bug-out bag to be comfortable to carry, even when it’s full and heavy, and you want it to blend in. Keep in mind that blending in doesn’t mean military-style camouflage; according to many preppers, camouflage can be like a giant neon sign, pointing out that you may have essentials that other people want to steal. Don’t scoff — haven’t you seen The Road? Besides the bag, arguably the most important bug-out bag essentials are related to water and hydration. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that an average individual needs 2.5-3 liters of drinking water per day. Also consider buying a foldable water bottle, filter, and purification tablets. An average individual needs 2.5-3 liters of drinking water per day Next up, food stuffs. You probably want a variety of non-perishable food items, some that require water to cook and some that don’t. Protein bars and MREs are what you’re looking for, along with a can opener, spork, small cooking pot, and a portable stove if you can swing it. Clothes are important, but should be comfortable and keep you warm and dry — woolen underwear and a couple of lightweight layers should do fine. What’s probably really worth investing in is enough warm socks and a sturdy pair of boots. When everyone is trying to get out of dodge, driving is probably not feasible, and walking might be the fastest and safest way to get around. You don’t want to be sleep-deprived when the world is going Hunger Games on you Being warm and well rested is another concern; you probably don’t want to be sleep-deprived when the world is going Hunger Games on you. A compressible sleeping bag and tent are good options to consider, along with at least three types of tinder, for redundancy. That means waterproof matches, lighters, flint, and even cotton balls and Vaseline. A waterproof, hand-cranked flashlight should also be a priority. These are the bare essentials, but depending on space, other items to include are: multi-tool or survival bracelet with a knife and emergency whistle, a first aid kit, sanitizer, wet wipes, note pad and pencil, sunscreen, batteries covered in electrical tape, and pepper spray. A pocket-sized paperback book might also be worth stuffing in so you don't go stir crazy. When the world ends, Netflix and Spotify are likely to go down with it. Lastly, consider bugging in vs. bugging out. Presumably, like most people, you live in a urban area, and don’t have a handy chunk of forest (conveniently equipped with a water source and plentiful wildlife — or nuts and berries if you’re a hippie type) to sustain you. If it’s properly stocked and easily defensible, your home might be the best place to buckle down.

In lean years — the ‘73 oil crisis and its multi-decade fallout, for instance — a muscle car could conceivably deliver just a couple hundred horses from an anemic V-8 engine, beset by new emissions requirements and a demand for better fuel efficiency. (To be fair, a switch from gross to net horsepower ratings didn’t help, either.) Advances in technology, helped along by the resurgence of the middle-class car enthusiast, eventually got us back to giant, throaty V-8s by the aughts. Of course, the pendulum is swinging again, just as it always does. I can feel it. But I think it’s a far less dreadful thing than it was 32 years ago. Over the weekend, I drove a camouflaged example of Chevrolet’s next-generation Camaro around the 2.3-mile road course of the Belle Isle Grand Prix, just a short drive from General Motors’ headquarters on the Detroit River. The experience was a little unusual: available with one of three engines, Chevy gave me the keys to the mid-level model, a variant of GM’s latest 3.6-liter V-6 that will make 335 horsepower in its Camaro configuration. At the outset I would’ve expected to drive the SS, featuring a 455-horsepower 6.2-liter V-8. When you’re debuting a new version of a car as iconic as the Camaro — a car designed specifically to do stoplight battle with Mustangs, stretching all the way back to its 1966 introduction — you want to play every card you’ve got, right?     But over the course of that Sunday morning on Belle Isle, the pieces fell into place for me. First, the SS isn’t the volume model; the Camaro is designed to be an eminently accessible performance car, and an SS isn’t leaving the dealership for under $30,000. Second, if journalists had gotten behind the wheel of the SS first, the lower-end models wouldn’t have gotten an ounce of press. And third, color me surprised, but this V-6 is damn good. Chevy had us first drive the current-generation Camaro equipped with the V-6, followed by the new one. The new model represents an increase of 12 horsepower but a fairly dramatic 28 percent increase in stiffness and 200-pound weight loss, facilitated by a smaller body and a significant uptick in the use of lightening materials and techniques. I wish I could’ve been blindfolded for the test to scrub any confirmation bias, but the next-gen car certainly felt lighter and more nimble on the track. It lacked the almost supernatural pull of a big V-8, but was delightful to flick around the course’s tight corners. (I wish I'd had far more time with it, but drivers were turning just a single lap before letting the next group go.) And — this is a far bigger deal than I’d like to admit — this unassuming six-banger will have one of the meanest stock exhaust notes from a cheap performance car on the street. It keeps its composure under mild acceleration, but when you punch it, it lets out a blood-curdling braaaaap! that makes the last-gen V-6 sound like a Lincoln Town Car.     Strangely, I might be even more excited to try the turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder option, which will be the new Camaro’s base engine. It’s good for 275 horsepower. 275! We’re working with specific outputs that production vehicles could only dream of 30 years ago, a weird place where an engine size starts to decouple wildly from its rubber-meets-road capability. The timeless adage, ""there’s no replacement for displacement,"" may still hold true — the three engines coming to the Camaro are evidence of that — but it’s less true than ever. Like Moore’s Law, it is destined to become a fallacy over time, and we’re perilously close to that tipping point. Just earlier this month, Volkswagen unveiled a 1-liter, three-cylinder engine capable of nearly 270 horsepower. Heinz-Jakob Neußer, head of VW’s powertrain development, called it ""a nice example of just how much potential combustion engines still have in them."" And that’s precisely the thing: I believe we are now ready, at long last, to have our cake and eat it, too. Muscle cars are associated with big-displacement engines only because they’ve always been, not because they need to be. And now, unlike in 1973, we have the technology to produce a six-cylinder slice of Americana that’s still capable of putting a giant grin on your face, and, as I learned this weekend, turn your knuckles white on an IndyCar race course. Heck, we’re even ready for turbocharged fours: Ford has been doing it on the Mustang since the latest model went on sale last year, and the Camaro is about to do the same. But this isn’t the end, it’s really just the beginning: the next inevitable step will be for these cars to adopt hybrid drivetrains. The market isn’t ready today — let’s get folks accustomed to these tiny four-cylinder engines first — but the technology is there, and it’s rapidly dropping in price. GM already offers hybrids across a fairly wide swath of its product portfolio, but they’re focused on efficiency, not performance. Cars like the LaFerrari and Porsche 918 prove that there’s a technological case for combining the limitless torque of an electric motor with the roar of a performance-oriented combustion engine, though. Eventually, it’ll happen across the broader market. In the meantime, it’s interesting (and kind of exciting) to see that combustion engine tech still advances apace. It’s not a glamorous job: if you want sexy powertrains, you’re probably focused on Elon Musk, with one eye toward the billions of dollars that Toyota is pouring into hydrogen. But as Ford’s Mark Fields told me, gasoline is still the industry’s bread and butter, and it likely will be until there are literally zero tradeoffs for average buyers. For now, if a fun, loud Camaro can sip gas like it’s drinking from a teacup and do it very, very affordably, that’s a decent place to be.

The mostly square, chubby little touchscreen devices that barked directions at us as we drove used to be suction-cupped to nearly every auto on the road. Like iPods, portable game players, and walkie talkies, the smartphone has all but obviated the need for dedicated GPS units, outside of specific industries. But while the popularity of these little personal navigation assistants has waned dramatically over the past seven or eight years, they do still exist, and companies like Garmin are still developing new models. The latest, and most high-end, of these new models is the nüviCam LMTHD, an awkwardly named $399.99 GPS unit that is desperately trying to be more than just a thing that serves directions.   If you used to (or still do) have a GPS unit, it was probably pretty bulky, not very attractive, and it likely had a resistive touchscreen that was obsolete the second the first iPhone was announced. The nüviCam is none of those things: it’s a sleek, tablet-like device with a big, 6-inch capacitive display and a cool magnetic mount that snaps it to its windshield-mounted dock. It’s metal instead of plastic, and while it’s not as thin as the latest smartphones or tablets, it’s certainly far better than the GPS units of yore. It still has a laughably short 30 minute battery life, which is really just there to let you restart your car without restarting the unit. The 6-inch display has a low, WVGA (800 x 480 pixel) resolution that would be laughable on a smartphone or tablet, but it’s fine here. You’re not reading email or watching video on the nüviCam, and since it’s a few feet away when mounted in your car, you never actually see the pixels of the display. More important than resolution is that the display is visible in bright sunlight, and the nüviCam doesn’t have any issues there. The 6-inch screen is bright and visible in direct sunlight But what makes the nüviCam different from every other GPS unit that preceded it is the camera on its backside. The camera serves two purposes: it’s a dash cam that can constantly record as you drive and save clips whenever it detects an impact or possible accident (there are two microSD slots for storage), and it’s a driver safety device that alerts you when you get too close to the vehicle in front or if you drift outside the painted lines on the road.  The dash cam functionality has questionable utility. If you’re someone who finds yourself constantly getting into fender benders, it might be useful to have a record of what happened, including audio. But in my time using the nüviCam, I didn’t get in any accidents (intentional or otherwise) and it mostly just kept a record of when I went over significant bumps in the road. The lane guidance and collision detection features of the camera are a bit more interesting, as they are things you typically only see in newer vehicles. I don’t drive a new German luxury car, but with the nüviCam, even my 12-year-old Toyota Corolla can tell me when I’m getting too close to the person in front of me (when traveling over 30 mph) or drifting outside of the lanes. The nüviCam will flash yellow warnings and beep loudly whenever I cross the double yellow or solid white lines on the road. It’s not very effective with dotted lines, however; I was able to drift across a three-lane highway without a peep from the nüviCam. That makes sense: you wouldn’t want to have the thing light up and throw a fit every time you switched lanes on the road, though perhaps a more subtle notification would be appropriate for dotted lines. It’d be more useful if the nüviCam let me know when a vehicle was in my blind spot on the left or right, but I can’t see how it would do that with its current, single-camera setup. The nuvicam can't escape the fact that it's mostly just a GPS unit But even with its fancy dashcam and driver safety features, the nüviCam can’t really escape the fact that it’s still mostly just a GPS unit. Most people should just use their smartphone for navigation in their car (if their car doesn’t already have a built-in system), but even if you have reasons for wanting a dedicated GPS unit, it’s hard to justify spending $400 on this one. Garmin has an entire line of GPS units that cost hundreds of dollars less than the nüviCam and provide the same level of navigation, just without the dashcam or lane guidance features. And again, those features aren’t good enough to justify the higher price.

The researcher, Chris Roberts, was banned from all United Airlines flights in April after tweeting a joke about exploiting flight control vulnerabilities while on a plane, Wired reports. After the plane landed in Syracuse, New York, FBI agents escorted Roberts off the flight and confiscated several of his electronics, including a MacBook Pro and several thumb drives. According to Wired, they told Roberts a warrant to search the devices was pending, and they filed a warrant application two days later. A Canadian media outlet published the application yesterday. Roberts had previously met with the FBI in February of this year to discuss vulnerabilities with In Flight Entertainment (IFE) systems. He reportedly told agents that he was able to exploit these vulnerabilities 15 to 20 times from 2011 to 2014. Roberts claimed it was possible for him to gain physical access to the IFE system through the Seat Electronic Box (SEB) located under seats containing video monitors, according to the FBI affidavit. Roberts was able to connect his laptop to the IFE system, allowing him to overwrite code on the aircraft's Thrust Management Computer and issue flight commands from his seat. The stories don't quite match up Not unexpectedly, there are some discrepancies between the FBI's version of things and Roberts' own story. The warrant application suggests Roberts said he issued the CLB or ""climb command"" while on a flight, causing one of the engines to climb and ""resulting in a lateral or sideways movement"" of the aircraft. But Roberts told Wired that while he was able to hack into the IFE system, he never commandeered the flight. He says he has caused a plane to climb during flight, but only during a simulated test. On Twitter, Roberts claims much of the affidavit takes things he said out of context: It's busy...and a LOT of its out of context I'm afraid https://t.co/mWvYzNpDRW  ""I’m obviously concerned those [conversations] were held behind closed doors and apparently they’re no longer behind closed doors,"" Roberts told Wired. When FBI agents searched the plane after the flight, they found SEBs under two of the aircraft's seats ""showed signs of tampering,"" according to the warrant application. But when Wired asked Roberts if he had connected his laptop to the SEBs on that flight, he reportedly said, ""Nope I did not. That I’m happy to say and I’ll stand from the top of the tallest tower and yell that one."" ""We believed that Roberts had the ability and the willingness to use the equipment then with him to access or attempt to access the IFE and possibly the flight control systems on any aircraft equipped with an IFE system, and that it would endanger public safety,"" the affidavit reads. Roberts helped found the company One World Labs, and told Wired yesterday that several investors had already withdrawn funding as a result of the incident.

The 1989 Patrick Swayze vehicle is an awful, utterly awesome movie filled with clattering dialogue and razor-sharp roundhouse kicks. Babak Ganjei agrees with me. He's dedicated the past few months of his life to creating a graphic novel based on Swayze's fourth-greatest movie, titled Babak Ganjei's Roadhouse, and it’s astonishingly good. Roadhouse was born from willful procrastination. ""I'd just started renting a studio I couldn't afford with no real idea what I was going to do,” Ganjei  tells The Verge. ""I had Road House streaming off Netflix on my laptop. I'm not sure why, but rather than turn it off I figured I'd use it as the source material for some drawing."" After recreating a few frames from the movie, it became clear that the next logical step was to do the entire movie. ""A handful of drawings would be some hipster drivel, but a minute-by-minute reimagining would take the movie as a basis and turn [it] into something else."" Before long, Ganjei had 70 drawings covering scenes throughout the movie's two hour running length (""I got slightly carried away,"" he explains), and some three months later those 70 had become 185 beautifully crafted pen-and-ink frames. He then set about captioning the frames, treating each as individual artworks. Rather than relying on dialogue from the movie, Ganjei chose to fill the majority of his book with musings from the likes of David Foster Wallace, Michel Foucault, Jean Baudrillard, Richard Pryor, and others including himself. Of course, there are some quotes from the movie in there, but they’re few and far between. It's this juxtaposition of familiar scenes and seemingly disconnected captions that makes Ganjei's creation perhaps the best graphic novel I've read since Persepolis. I call it a graphic novel, but it might be easier to describe Babak Ganjei's Roadhouse as a twisted, adult take on a Disney read-along storybook. Streaming Swayze's throat-ripping antics from Netflix while flipping through a companion book filled with quasi-philosophical musings is a truly unique experience. You can pick up a copy of Babak Ganjei's Roadhouse from its independent publisher Records Records Records or directly from the artist's site, where you'll also find his past work like the semi-autobiographical Hilarious Consequences comic. At the moment, Ganjei is gauging the reaction to Roadhouse, but he isn't ruling out giving other questionable movies the same treatment. ""I quite like the idea of Police Academy, and I just watched 48 Hours for the first time. [It's] aggressively macho, racist, sexist, you name it.

Come summer, those will all begin to grow fruits, including different types of cherries, peaches, plums, nectarines, and apricots.  Cherries, peaches, plums, nectarines, and apricots Van Aken, who tells Epicurious that he grew up on a farm, uses a technique called grafting to combine the similar fruit types onto a single tree. His use of the technique is certainly on the uncommon side, though similarly expansive efforts have been done before — The Daily Mail reports that a man in England put 250 varieties of apples on a single tree. Van Aken's trees are certainly designed more for the art of their blooming, but there's a preservation element that he's bringing in to it too.

The text translates as, ""Let us endure hardship with a smile!"" An exhibition of works by a former North Korean propaganda artist was cancelled this week in China, reportedly under orders from the Chinese government. As AFP reports, Beijing's Yuan Dian gallery was planning to show a collection from Sun Mu, a North Korean defector who uses a pseudonym for fear of retribution from Pyongyang. The month-long exhibition was due to open on July 27th, but according to South Korea's Yonhap news agency, Chinese police blocked people from entering the gallery and removed Sun Mu's paintings just before the opening. Officials gave no reason for the closing, though China has a long history of censoring both media and art, and it remains North Korea's most important ally. China is North Korea's biggest trade partner, supplying the isolated dictatorship with food and oil, though there have been signs of strain between the two countries since Kim Jong Un ascended to power in Pyongyang. The exhibition scheduled to open in Beijing this week was titled ""Red White Blue"" — a reference, organizers said, to the national colors of the six countries involved in talks over North Korea's nuclear program.   Landscape 2 Sun Mu, for his part, said simply that the Beijing exhibition was ""not being held as planned,"" and declined to give further details. ""I need to figure out the situation first,"" the artist told AFP. ""I can't talk too much right now."" Sun Mu fled North Korea in 1998 and settled in Seoul in 2001. He grew up singing songs of praise for the Communist regime and, while serving in the army, was trained to create propaganda posters for the government. Much of the work he produced relied on familiar tropes — images touting North Korea's military might, coupled with impassioned slogans calling for citizens to defend their leaders at all costs.     He decided to escape following a devastating famine during the mid-1990s, and soon embarked on a more subversive artistic path, producing satirical paintings in the same propagandistic style he had come to know so well. One features an image of the elder Kim wielding a knife, a maniacal grin spread across his face; others include bold slogans like ""Open Korea."" Some are more subtle in their commentary on the notoriously hermetic state — a North Korean schoolgirl screaming with joy while listening to an iPod or drinking Coca-Cola. Sun Mu's works were met with some confusion at first; when he exhibited paintings in Seoul in 2007, some interpreted it as true Communist propaganda, and alerted South Korean authorities. His irony has become more apparent, though, and today his paintings reportedly fetch as much as $20,000 a piece. Yet Sun Mu continues to shy away from the limelight, for fear that revealing his identity may jeopardize the safety of his relatives in North Korea. In South Korea, he's known as the ""faceless"" painter because of his refusal to be photographed. To date, his most famous work is Happy Children — a series of paintings of North Korean schoolchildren wearing identical smiles. The figures are chilling in their uniform, robotic glee, but Sun Mu says they're very much rooted in reality. ""They teach you how to smile that regimented smile — there’s a certain way to shape your mouth,"" he told the New York Times in 2009. ""We children thought we were happy. We didn’t realize that our smile was fabricated and manufactured.""  ",0.40082679328175896,0.599173206718241,0.8782458610903144,596,4.9093959731543624,367,5.8119891008174385,0,0,"Design, US & World"

Driven by a sense of urgency coming from its falling smartphone sales, the Korean company has taken decisive steps to rectify its stagnant design, improve its marketing, and streamline its operations. It's also adopted a refreshingly collaborative approach when it comes to working with others. Today's Samsung seeks alliances, not adversaries. 2014 began with Samsung and Google holding crisis talks over the Korean company's excessive customizations of the Android user experience. Google was worried that Samsung's tweaks were degrading the quality of that experience and making it increasingly difficult to recognize as being Android at all. In August, Microsoft filed a suit against Samsung alleging it wasn't paying proper royalties for using Microsoft IP in Android. And a year earlier, Apple was signing contracts with another chip manufacturer to reduce its reliance on Samsung as the chief producer of its iPhone processors.  Samsung seeks alliances, not adversaries The big and grandiose Samsung of yesteryear, the company that broke its earnings records every quarter, felt confident enough to pick fights with the tech industry's biggest players. When Apple accused it of blatantly ripping off the iPhone, Samsung stuck to its guns — and even though it ended up paying damages to Apple, it arguably won more than it lost through the avalanche of free press that the lawsuit brought it. But that's not really a trick you can play twice, and a wiser Samsung is emerging that has managed to find common ground with most of its former antagonists. The Microsoft royalties dispute was settled in February and was swiftly followed by the bundling of Microsoft apps on the new Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge flagship phones from Samsung. But it wasn't a total Microsoft takeover, either. Both devices run Google's Android Lollipop software and it truly is Google's Android. The Material Design principles that Matias Duarte and the rest of the Android design team developed have been faithfully recreated in Samsung's latest hardware. It's not pure Android, but it's the closest that Samsung could come to it while still retaining some sense of ownership and uniqueness to its own user experience. 200 people are working on the Samsung-Apple relationship and, for once, they're not all lawyers The special case of Samsung's relationship with Apple now has a dedicated team — made up of 200 Samsung employees — working solely on the task of producing displays for Apple. Samsung has also regained its role as a major supplier for iPhone components, securing orders for Apple's upcoming A9 chip. For all the hot rhetoric between these two companies over the years, the relationship they share remains symbiotic, and the latest signs suggest that it will intensify in a positive direction. While it's encouraging to see Samsung mending old associations, the Korean company has also been proactive in developing new ones. It has an exclusive Kindle for Samsung deal that secures some small perks for Galaxy device owners that want to use Amazon's online bookstore. When the Oculus Rift needed new displays for its latest version, Samsung stepped in with its Galaxy Note screens. Later, it created the Gear VR in collaboration with Facebook's Oculus, giving it a much better chance of seeing broader software support. And when Samsung decided to ramp up its efforts to compete with BlackBerry in the realm of mobile enterprise and security, it partnered with the incumbent leader instead of taking it on directly. Conflict always grabs more attention than collaboration. But sometimes tech companies find ways to work in harmony rather than discord, and those occasions are worth acknowledging too. Samsung has rethought every aspect of the way it does business, and its new friendlier attitude looks likely to benefit the Korean company in the long run. It should make for smaller legal bills, if nothing else.",0.42807566224134563,0.5719243377586544,0.15784588774068897,647,5.2024729520865529,378,6.253968253968254,0,0,"Business, Tech, Report"

As it has been for the last several quarters, the company's international expansion was the biggest driver of its customer growth. The Los Gatos, California-based company passed 40 million domestic subscribers and 20 million from overseas, adding over two million new customers in each category. Revenue grew to $1.57 billion compared with $1.27 billion for the same period a year ago. Profits shrank from $53 million for this period last year to just $23 million this quarter. But the stock soared in after-hours trading, up over 10 percent, a sign that investors are largely concerned with Netflix customer growth, not its bottom line. Analysts expect that while they are expensive to acquire, these new customers will allow for healthy profits in the future. ""We believe that international subscribers have two to three times faster profit trajectories than in the US,"" Laura Martin, an analyst for Needham, said in a research note last week. Analysts had predicted smaller domestic growth for Netflix, with many believing the US market is reaching a point of saturation. CEO Reed Hastings wrote in their shareholder letter that, ""We think strong U.S. growth benefited from our ever-improving content, including the launch of the third season of ‘House of Cards’ and new shows ‘Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt’ and ‘Bloodline’."" Netflix, by its own design, is now being weighed against HBO, which just rolled out its first offering that doesn't require a cable subscription. The two are similar in many ways, but when you dig into the financials, it's clear they have a very different cost structure. Last year they brought in nearly identical revenue: $5.5 billion for Netflix and $5.4 billion for HBO. Netflix, however, made just $266 million in annual profit, compared with HBO's $1.8 billion. There is also a big gap in the subscriber base: HBO ended last year with 138 million total subscribers, versus 57.4 million for Netflix. Put another way, despite having roughly equal revenues, HBO has roughly double the subscriber base and seven times the profits of Netflix.  The flip side is that Netflix is growing much faster. It added 13 million new members in 2014 compared with HBO's 5 million. But even if it were to double its size to 120 million, at its current margins it wouldn't have nearly HBO's profits. Those margins would likely improve once Netflix stops spending so heavily on international growth, but comparing the two companies you can see why it took HBO so long to break with the golden goose of cable TV and offer a stand-alone streaming option.",0.5192536880002253,0.4807463119997747,0.5475137382233642,447,5.1006711409395971,282,5.7446808510638299,0,0,"Business, Culture, Entertainment, Tech"

I feel like I should apologize for my role in this latest round of financing, but chances are I'm not going to stop. My first Sprig order happened last November after I complained to a fellow New York City transplant about the lack of inexpensive and non-greasy delivery options here. Girl, just order Sprig, she said. It'll be there in 15 minutes, she said. You can get a salad, she said. This is how it starts. Six months later, I have spent $423.81 on items like Bagel & Lox ($12), Coriander Steak Salad ($11), and Goat Cheese Tart and Tomato Soup (served warm, $9). That total does not include regular or ""dynamic"" delivery fees, Sprig's pet name for surge pricing. Not because those fees don't stack up, but because I signed up for Sprig Go, a premium service that charges $10 per month to avoid delivery fees and rush prices. Ordinarily the word ""premium,"" or even ""prime,"" wigs me out, but $10? It seemed so small. So reasonable. Especially compared to the rate at which Bacon Bourbon Chicken Sandwiches ($11.75) were arriving at my door just before the 2PM lunch cut-off. An asshole tax should be levied upon me What makes Sprig different from other food delivery apps? Nothing, really. The apps all benefit from beautifully shot food porn. Little labels indicate whether an item is spicy, gluten-free, or, God help us, ""paleo-friendly."" At first, it seemed less luxe than Munchery, with its cashmere-clad couples by the fireplace. Sprig is certainly cheaper than Postmates, the Uber Black of takeout indulgences, which can easily double the price of a burrito delivered from a few blocks away. No judgments! An asshole tax is perfectly ethical and should be levied upon me. Sprig was just easy. The food arrived so quickly it seemed like couriers must be driving around the Mission just waiting for my click. (Sprig has its own kitchens in San Francisco and Palo Alto.) I began to converse shamelessly with the smartphone app, always rating the delivery person as excellent, but sometimes complaining about the meals. The food was strange, but it was ours. We were in a domestic relationship. The app even wrote me back.       All was good in my hood, except for the great lox-and-cream-cheese travesty of February 27th. Never, no matter how homesick you are, order lox from a startup. Then Sprig began offering dinner and brunch. It was hard not to notice that chicken pieces in dinner entrees were cut the same as the ones from lunch, but served with different glops of vaguely ethnic sauce. Lunch came in clear plastic containers that snapped open. Dinner came in a recyclable brown container, which I suspected was leeching cardboard particles into my food. How did I justify this to myself? And yet, I continued ordering. How did I justify this to myself? Not well. The whole enterprise seemed unscalable. There's no way this setup would work in every neighborhood in San Francisco, much less outside the Bay Area. Profitless-on-purpose only gets you so far — unless you raise $45 million in venture capital dollars from Social+Capital and Greylock Partners. That's $10 million more than DoorDash, which raised $35 million last month at a $600 million valuation. And it's $35 million more than SpoonRocket, which raised $10 million last year. Fifty-seven is a lot of millions. You can seriously undercut the competition while staying profitless — all because investors believe other people will soon behave as mindlessly as early adopters like me. Now I stand, Daenerys Targaryen pressed against the catacombs, wondering what rough beast I have raised, knowing I will have to use it in the food wars to come.

That effort starts today with the rollout of a new homepage for people who aren't signed into the service. More than 500 million people visit Twitter each month who aren't signed in, and of those, 125 million come directly to Twitter.com. Until now, unless you were there to sign up for an account, that page has been a dead end. Beginning today, though, people who aren't signed in will see a curated collection of timelines designed to show off popular parts of the Twitterverse. Choices include pop artists, cute animals, space news, business news, and actors and actresses. Click on one and you'll get a real-time feed of tweets from accounts that Twitter has chosen. Click ""pop artists,"" for example, and you'll see tweets from Carly Rae Jepsen, Katy Perry, and Shawn Mendes. ""TV shows & stars"" will show you tweets from The Good Wife, Modern Family, and Modern Family star Jesse Tyler Ferguson. Or click ""tech blogs & reporters"" and see news from The Verge, Wired, and other sites. Cute animals, business news, and tech The idea is that you can now visit Twitter to check out real-time news and conversations even if you never plan on creating an account. Twitter benefits in at least two ways — one, it can show you ads. And two, if you keep coming back, it can get you to sign up for an account and become a traditional user of the service. The company says 200 million people visit profile pages each month without signing in; if Twitter converts even a fraction of them into active users, it would help the company's growth efforts significantly. The new homepage also includes a prominent search bar that suggests queries for popular trends and hashtags, like #2016Election. For now, the new homepage will be available only on the desktop web in the United States. But Twitter expects that it will roll out broadly, and in a blog post it suggests that it's continuing to experiment with the page's design.",0.32054518187782144,0.6794548181221786,0.16225490916620838,395,4.8151898734177214,235,5.506382978723404,1,0,"Business, Tech, Report"

Opponents wasted no time. CTIA, the trade association that has represented the wireless industry since 1984, filed a lawsuit with the DC Circuit Court of Appeals today. In a blog post, the group wrote that it intends to push back against ""the FCC’s decision to impose sweeping new net neutrality rules and reclassifying mobile broadband as a common carrier utility."" The National Cable and Telecommunications Association, the American Cable Association, and AT&T also filed suits along similar grounds. The FCC learned from its earlier legal losses The lawsuits follow an earlier legal challenge by broadband companies, who object to be classified as Title II services. The FCC, for its part, choose Title II because it believed that would give it a stronger argument in court, something it learned after losing a similar battle over open internet rules to Verizon. But the agency went out of its way to enumerate the ways in which it will forbear from enforcing many of the common carrier regulations that Title II imposes on telephone networks. ""This includes no unbundling of last-mile facilities, no tariffing, no rate regulation, and no cost accounting rules, which results in a carefully tailored application of only those Title II provisions found to directly further the public interest in an open internet and more, better, and open broadband,"" the agency wrote in the recently passed order. Big government is the boogeyman  The CTIA tried to frame the argument as big government bureaucrats versus innovative companies and their consumers. ""With today’s filing, CTIA seeks to protect the competitive mobile marketplace that thrived under a deregulatory framework for decades. The FCC’s new internet rules are full service regulations that will harm mobile consumers and providers across the country, as well as our nation's wireless future,"" said Ron Smith, chairman of the CTIA Board and CEO of Bluegrass Cellular. ""Instead of letting consumers decide the success of new, innovative mobile services, government bureaucrats will now play that role."" Of course, broadband internet companies like Verizon have been identifying themselves as Title II common carriers when it's helpful for building out their fiber networks. And the new rules aimed at mobile carriers would only prevent them from blocking, throttling, or prioritizing certain data, or offering to exempt certain service from data caps.

The American company's business is as lucrative as it is prestigious, owing to Apple's vast scale and concordantly massive orders. No better evidence of this can be presented than today's Bloomberg report suggesting that Samsung has set up a dedicated team of 200 people committed to the task of making displays for Apple devices. The group is said to have been created at the beginning of this month, alongside a broader restructuring of Samsung's display business that sees its LCD and OLED divisions split into two separate units. A company spokesperson has confirmed that structural split to Bloomberg, but declined to elaborate. Samsung's effort to cater more specifically to Apple's display requirements is apparently not unique, as LG is said to have a similar unit dedicated to serving Apple's needs. These bespoke services show just how aggressively parts manufacturers are pursuing Apple's business, even while their parent companies directly compete with, and occasionally even litigate against, Apple. Still, relations between Samsung and Apple have been steadily warming ever since their big courtroom clash of 2012, and Samsung isn't limiting itself to making just displays for Apple, either. A December report from Korea's Electronic Times suggested that Samsung has secured orders for manufacturing the processor for Apple's next iPhone, which Bloomberg has corroborated via separate sources familiar with the matter. Bloomberg's information differs, as it claims Samsung will be producing Apple's A9 chip at its Giheung plant in South Korea rather than its Austin, Texas facility, as initially reported by Electronic Times. In any case, it seems likely that the next iPhone and iPad will rely significantly on Apple's biggest competitor for their internal components.

Three other members of the original coalition — NDTV, Newshunt, and the Times Group — also declared that they were pulling some or all of their services from Internet.org due to concerns over net neutrality. The concept of net neutrality has been a hot topic of debate in the US over the last few months as the FCC adopted more stringent rules. That recently became true of India, too. As ClearTrip wrote on their blog, ""Over the past couple of weeks, a heated debate on net neutrality has come to the forefront, not just amongst India’s digerati, but in mainstream media as well, with national dailies carrying front page articles about it."" NDTV is committed to net neutrality and is therefore exiting, and will not be a part of, Facebook's http://t.co/r3IZLs9qEJ initiative.  Airtel, a mobile network operator in India, was working with local startups to create a platform where startups could pay for data usage, making their services free for users.

Internet.org worked the same way, providing users with free access to a selection of 39 ""essential"" services, including Facebook.

""I think net neutrality is important to make sure network operators don’t discriminate and limit access to services people want to use, especially in countries where most people are online,"" he wrote. ""For people who are not on the internet, though, having some connectivity and some ability to share is always much better than having no ability to connect and share at all.

German federal prosecutor Harald Range said in a statement on Friday there was insufficient evidence to continue the investigation, The New York Times reports. Back in 2013, German newspaper Der Spiegel ran a report claiming the US had been monitoring Merkel's phone since 2002, based on internal NSA documents it had obtained. The White House responded by assuring Merkel she was no longer being monitored, but the report suggested the surveillance had gone on for more than a decade. No proof it was an ""authentic"" order Range noted that while the NSA documents did contain a phone number that could be traced back to Merkel, there wasn't enough evidence to suggest there had been an ""authentic"" order from the NSA to tap the phone. He also said there wasn't enough evidence to prove Merkel's phone had actually been tapped. ""It was possible to determine that the telephone number listed is assigned to a mobile telephone used by the chancellor,"" Range said, according to the Times.

Despite pushback from European leaders against the NSA's less-than-palatable surveillance tactics, President Obama has remained relatively neutral on the topic.

In some cases, those marketers have often avoided facial recognition systems because of the privacy concerns, but the industry's inherent secrecy makes it difficult to tell when such systems are being deployed. Many in the industry saw a voluntary code of conduct as an easy compromise to enforce transparency and avoid privacy concerns down the road. Based on today's withdrawal, it seems unlikely that compromise will happen any time soon.

With this pitch, the company managed to sell 60,000 first edition Fairphones — a small figure, sure, but the company still says they sold ""quicker than anticipated."" Now, it's unveiled the Fairphone 2, saying that this time the device will not only be ethically sourced but also easily repairable. Fairphone will sell spare parts for the phone itself, and says that users will be able to easily change the most commonly broken components, including the screen, camera, CPU, and speaker. No pliers or glue guns needed — the screen just unclips According to a report from The Next Web, the Fairphone 2 can be disassembled with ease. The rubberized back (which also doubles as a case) just slips off, while the screen itself can be detached using two clips. Internal components can then be removed and replaced with just a screwdriver — a far cry from the warranty-voiding specialized tools needed to repair smartphones from companies like Apple. By comparison, last year's Fairphone was also praised for being easy to take apart, although a teardown from iFixit noted that many smaller components were soldered in position and hard to replace. It's not clear if the Fairphone 2 will improve on that situation, but we'll need to see more details before we know how many more parts will be replaceable. The major downside, of course, is that the Fairphone 2 doesn't offer the best specs on the market — but it's certainly a capable device on paper. Buyers get a 5-inch HD display, 4G connectivity, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 801 processor, 2GB of RAM, an 8-megapixel camera, and 32GB of internal storage, expandable via microSD. The company says preorders for the device will start in this summer for €525 ($590), although it notes that ""for the duration of 2015, the phones will only be available in Europe.""  So yes, Fairphone's latest device isn't going to beat the Galaxy S6 in a speed test, but who needs speed when you're driving on the smartphone high road?

A portion of each phone's selling price goes toward a Welfare Fund for workers, and Fairphone is also sponsoring an e-waste recycling program in Ghana.

Reportedly, the Cardinals and MLB have already been hit with subpoenas related to the investigation. (MLB officials told the Times that they were aware of the breach and were cooperating fully with the investigation.) The investigation is reportedly revolving around Astros general manager Jeff Luhnow, who worked for the Cardinals while the team developed a computer network to house its operational information, before leaving for the Astros and spearheading the creation of a similar system. The hack may have been a way for the Cardinals to determine what information, exactly, Luhnow had taken with him. Investigators reportedly believe the hack wasn't complicated. According to the Times, the Astros' network was entered from a house where some Cardinals officials lived. Evidence apparently suggests the Cardinals officials were able to enter the Astros network by reusing a master list of passwords that Luhnow had used during his time at the Cardinals. But regardless of the complexity of the hack, if true, the event could be a watershed moment in corporate espionage: as the Times points out, this would be the first known time a sports team has hacked into a network to steal from a rival.",0.3540823428528862,0.6459176571471138,0.850305587746136,271,5.3321033210332107,161,6.0434782608695654,0,0,"Tech, US & World"

Truly ridiculous, and not made much better by the subsequent introduction of his mentor, the wise and similarly ridiculously named Qui-gon Jinn. There are a few schools of Star Wars names. There are the garden-variety Lukes and Gavins of the galaxy, the kind of characters that tie us to the setting and make us feel that their galaxy is ours. Then there are the almost-normal. Think ""Han"" — so close to the real-life ""Hans"" that you've probably internalized it and accepted it by now. Or Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin — sounds like a name, right? You'd be wrong, but don't question it. Pity Jedi Master Bayts But dig through the archives and you'll find countless examples of names gone wrong. Pity poor Sio Bibble, Dash Rendar, and Jedi Master Bayts. Pity Wedge Antilles and Count Dooku, two major characters named for a golf club and a kid's word for a shit, respectively. Pity Kit Fisto, Savage Opress, Darth Wyyrlok, and URoRRuR'R'R, while you're at it. If you're going to do sci-fi set in a galaxy far, far away, then you can embrace the gamut of nomenclature. Dearly departed sci-fi author Iain M. Banks did this as standard, naming his characters with jumbles of letters, and his ships like Fall Out Boy songs just because he could. In 1953, Raymond Chandler made jokes about sci-fi literature using words like ""Google"" and ""Adabaran III."" But Star Wars walks a weird line, mixing real names with contorted ones, smashing together nouns and noises to make humans, aliens, creatures, and droids. It's tricky to name an entire galaxy of sentient beings across 30-plus years of literature, but there seems to be a bias for choosing the worst possible name whenever possible — the same bias, presumably, that gave birth to the concept of a ""jizz-wailer"" as a (surprisingly family-friendly) job description. But with Episode VII rapidly approaching, surfing a wave of renewed interest in the revamped expanded universe, it's time for you to get your own Star Wars name.

The company just announced that it's invited the first outside testers to Project Sansar, its working title for a new VR world that is expected to open in public beta next year. Second Life, which maintained a core group of devoted users and a steady economy even after fading from public view, was a virtual world in its own right — just not one that was meant to be experienced through a headset. Although Linden hacked in Second Life support for the Oculus Rift development kits last year, the long-term plan has always been to create a totally new, VR-native network to run alongside the older platform. That was revealed earlier this year as Project Sansar, which is being touted not just as a world, but as ""WordPress for VR."" Linden Lab has described it as infrastructure that will let users create their own VR experiences and visit other people's. Project Sansar has been billed as the ""WordPress of VR."" Today, Linden Lab says it's inviting a small number of people to kickstart that process. Beyond that, the scant details suggest that Project Sansar is still in an early state. A company spokesperson says the first testers are ""talented 3D content creators Linden Lab knows well,"" which could indicate that it's drawing from the pool of Second Life architects and designers. For now, Project Sansar doesn't have its own building tools, so they'll be using the Maya modeling software and exporting the results into the game (something that's also common in Second Life). The final release is supposed to have its own tools and support a variety of third-party software. Project Sansar's first visitors are mostly, it seems, testing very basic functionality; they'll make their own environments and look at those created by other users and Linden Lab itself. As we've previously heard, more members will be added over the course of 2015, a beta version is supposed to launch alongside the consumer Oculus Rift headset, and a finished release could be out by the end of next year. Besides VR headsets, Project Sansar will support traditional PCs and, eventually, mobile devices. So far, the general public hasn't seen anything from inside the world, just the stylized concept art above; Linden Lab was vague about when we might see more. But the project evokes some very familiar tropes from science fiction, including the VR-themed novel Ready Player One. Linden Lab also isn't the only company working on a platform for virtual worlds.

When current Apple Music users were asked if they would subscribe to the service once the trial ends, 64 percent said they were very likely, a decent rate, but not a great one for a company that loves to tout its customer satisfaction rates during every earning's call. Sixty-one percent of current Apple Music users have turned off auto-renewal option for the service as well, a fact that will likely upset the music labels, who are withholding judgement on the service until the trial period runs out in October. There are some bright spots for Apple — 28 percent of Spotify Premium subscribers are also using Apple Music, and only 77 percent of iOS users are aware of Apple Music, leaving plenty of room for growth. But if this survey makes anything clear, it's that Apple Music may be in for a rough patch when it's time for users to pay up.

Its PC business is now its former PC business, and the mobile devices that were meant to save it have landed the company into even more trouble. In spite of making a series of very good Xperia smartphones, the Japanese company finds itself perpetually on the back foot against competitors that are either cheaper, more popular, better distributed, or some combination of all three. So how do you solve a problem like Sony's smartphone dilemma? Not with a freaking 4K display. Sony decided to do the thirstiest thing possible at IFA this year by introducing a new 5.5-inch Xperia Z5 Premium with a display resolution of 3840 x 2160. Yes, it's the first 4K smartphone in the world, and I'm always willing to give Sony the benefit of the doubt, but this is one step too far. 1440p displays on phones are generally unnecessary, offering improvements over 1080p panels that vary between the indistinguishable and the non-existent. Going to 4K is just silly. I thought so before I walked into the halls of IFA and I am even more assured in that thinking now that I've eyeballed Sony's Z5 Premium up close. I don't need my Android icons to have a resolution measured in megapixels The display of this phone is gorgeous, there's no denying that, but its resolution is not what makes it so. It has great color reproduction, contrast, and viewing angles — all the things that usually matter to a display that already has enough pixels — and 1080p is still very much enough pixels for a 5.5-inch device. Maybe once virtual reality headsets and accessories become more common, the Z5 Premium's surplus of resolution might actually come in useful. But then, why not grab this display technology and put it into a dedicated VR headset instead of jacking it into a phone? I honestly don't need my Android icons to have a resolution measured in megapixels. It's a strain on the processor and therefore the battery, and I'd much rather have a lean and efficient machine than one with a really, really out-there spec. This is the truest exhibition of a tech company flexing its tech muscle that I've seen in a long time. I thought everyone had wised up and was following, at least superficially, the maxim that innovation should be meaningful and / or functional. The spec wars are over, but Sony seems to have been so thoroughly shellshocked by the way they turned out that it's now in a trance and continuing to fight them blindly. That's my best theory for why a company struggling to sell phones just launched a super expensive smartphone with an entirely unnecessary screen.",0.43447800950984583,0.5655219904901542,0.1517634681102454,458,4.7947598253275112,275,5.7854545454545452,0,0,"Google, Mobile, Tech, Hands-on, IFA 2015"

Collectively, these three companies account for a third of global PC shipments, and they represent an industry-wide trend toward promoting more gaming gear. The hope is that slumping PC sales can be rejuvenated by appealing to the class of users who upgrade their hardware most often and spend most lavishly. The PC gaming market produced $21.5 billion in hardware sales last year, according to data from Jon Peddie Research, which is more than double the revenues derived from console sales. More notably, unlike the broader PC market, which continues shrinking, gaming PC sales are projected to increase over the next couple of years. The JPR analysis suggests the biggest chunk of gaming PC revenue — somewhere in the vicinity of 44 percent — comes from the so-called enthusiast segment, which the researchers identify as ""very performance and style oriented, much like sports car owners.""  Sports car PCs are exactly what we saw from the big manufacturers at IFA. Acer’s Predators, whether it be on the desktop or in the form of pseudo-portable laptops, ape Lamborghini’s angular shapes and aggressive motifs throughout. Asus, with its Republic of Gamers sub-brand, does the very same. From overclocked monitors to otherworldly arachnid routers, both of these Taiwanese companies are pushing as hard as they can to give conventional, commoditized products the veneer of a fresh attitude and personality. Even the software on their computers features sharp, aggressive edges, superfluous illumination, and promises of unbelievable speed. Just like sports cars. PC gaming is big business, but are gaming PCs? But there’s one important distinction that Acer, Asus, and Lenovo seem to be overlooking: even very wealthy people can’t easily build their own sports car, whereas most gamers are fully capable of constructing their own gaming rig. Sports cars are sold as discrete luxury items with no immediate alternative. Gaming PCs put on the same airs, but can be replaced by far cheaper and more personal custom builds. Their only advantage is more immediate convenience. And so, even though the flashing LED lights on a gaming laptop might suggest the opportunity for improving profit margins through smarter styling and marketing, it remains highly unlikely that any of these companies will find the gamer salvation that they’re desperately hoping for. Make no mistake about it, the situation for Taiwan's once-flourishing hardware makers is indeed desperate. Unlike US competitors Dell and HP, who have the insulation of strong enterprise businesses, Acer and Asus produce gear primarily for the consumer, with no diversification strategy to offset slumps in their core business. The blame for their present plight, though, can be found in their own, recklessly aggressive actions.   The two Taiwanese manufacturers struck gold with the netbook craze of a decade ago, selling no-frills laptops at rock-bottom prices and making their profit through sheer volume of sales. They then looked to move up the food chain with the same strategy of undercutting the competition, and the result has been an erosion of profit margins throughout the PC industry. Every time that Asus chairman Jonney Shih takes the stage to announce the price of a new product, it's always that extra bit lower than the rest, raising eyebrows and stirring hype. The latest example is the ZenWatch 2, which at €149 is among the cheapest, yet also prettiest Android Wear options around. Constantly undercutting the competition only works in a constantly growing market Operating at just a sliver above breaking even, and sometimes below, is hardly a sustainable long-term strategy, though it's been effective in undermining and sometimes even ousting the competition entirely. Samsung no longer sells laptops in Europe. LG never really tried. Sony no longer sells laptops or desktops anywhere, having sold off the VAIO brand to focus on mobile devices. And now Acer is joining the ranks of endangered PC species with word that founder Stan Shih is open to a takeover.   The problem with the Taiwanese strategy is that it's reliant on unabated growth. It's designed to capture the biggest share of a constantly expanding pie, but it fails when that expansion stagnates. And stagnation is exactly where the PC market finds itself today, with too many PCs already out there and competently doing the things people need them to do. Intel has spent this year talking up the billion PCs out in the world that haven't been upgraded in more than three years, as if it's some vast untapped opportunity, but those PCs might remain un-upgraded for another year or two. What PC makers need is a spark to prompt people to buy new stuff and gaming has reliably proven itself to be that catalyst. After all, gaming is helping keep Sony's bottom line steady, courtesy of the PlayStation 4, and it's also sustaining companies like Nvidia and AMD, whose efforts to design something other than excellent graphics chips have almost uniformly failed. Because of the great draw of gaming, even Lenovo is diving into the black-and-red and angry-all-over super-stylized PC business. A billion ageing PCs: huge opportunity, or just evidence of a stagnant market? Whether gaming provides a shot in the arm for these companies or not, it promises to only ever be a temporary solution. As Anssi Vanjoki, Nokia's one-time mobile chief, once said of building Android phones, the action is akin to boys ""peeing in their pants"" for warmth in the winter. He's been proven accurate by the passage of time, and there's now an analogous situation for PC makers, who live and die by selling increasingly large volumes of devices, but are facing a consumer preference shift toward mobile devices. Even if the present push for gamers' attention triggers a full, global upgrade cycle, what will Acer and Asus do in a year's time when everyone's got a still-perfectly-capable GeForce GTX plus Intel Skylake combo in their machine? That water-cooled ROG GX700 laptop isn't the answer, it's just a sign of growing desperation.   The situation didn't need to be quite so dire. Sure, Acer and Asus wrought this fate upon themselves, but other companies, whose fortunes are strongly intertwined with that of the PC industry, could have done more to avert it. AMD, which hasn’t been on an even competitive keel with Intel this decade, hasn’t helped. It's been practically anonymous for years. Intel clashed with repeated delays of its Broadwell processor line, and eventually introduced a distinctly underpowered Core M variant. For PC companies looking to assert themselves more strongly in the mobile space, Core M was supposed to be the deus ex machina, the thing that would bring all the positives of a larger x86 computer to the impossibly compact dimensions of an ultra-slim, fanless tablet. Microsoft has exacerbated price pressures with the excellent Surface Pro line Then Microsoft came along with the Surface Pro, quickly establishing that as the premier 2-in-1 Windows PC and taking the wind out of its partners' sails. And now Windows 10 has arrived and it doesn't require any extra power to run, making it unnecessary for casual PC users to upgrade. Every single company selling PCs today is conscious of the need to reform and start selling devices that rival and outdo the more portable varieties of personal computers like smartphones, phablets, and keyboard-equipped slates. They know. They just can't help it when their biggest partners either fail to deliver parts or dive into the same market with a superior product. So now it's time for gamer heroes. Intel and Microsoft can keep talking up touchscreens and RealSense cameras, but those aren't the things that will drive people to spend four figures on the latest high-spec machine. For gamers, Windows 10 is an incentive to buy new hardware because it introduces DirectX 12 for more advanced graphics processing. The same is true of Intel's Skylake, which isn't offering huge or immediately obvious benefits for casual use, but promises higher overclocking ceilings and the sort of performance boost that obsessive gamers care about. That will be comforting to Acer, Asus, and Lenovo in the near term, but eventually they'll all need to make the transition to having mobile PC lineups at least as strong as their desktop and laptop ranges — either that or they too might be swallowed up by the same profit black hole that already consumed Sony's PC division.",0.5132578037511881,0.4867421962488119,0.1652701017619966,1420,5.1119718309859152,749,6.4365821094793061,0,6,"Gaming, Microsoft, Tech, IFA 2015, Report"

At this year’s IFA, though, I got my hands on what seems like the category’s best hope: the Bragi Dash. After my time playing around with the Dash I’m convinced that wireless earbuds are definitely a viable technology, but I’m skeptical that the device of people's dreams will be delivered any time soon. The Dash, theoretically, is a pair of noise-canceling, touch-controlled earbuds that double up as a fitness tracker, with internal sensors measuring everything from distance traveled and steps taken to the wearer's pulse. They also function as a Bluetooth headset and have their own 4GB of internal memory, meaning you can leave your phone at home if you go for a run. They were originally funded by nearly 16,000 Kickstarter backers to the tune of $3.4 million, but have since missed successive shipment dates, with their promised arrival pushed back from November of last year to sometime this August. And, they've been delayed again.     Bragi’s Marijo Sarac tells me that the company is now hoping to deliver the Dash Beta 3 (the pair I tried out was the Beta 2) to backers who chose the developer option on Kickstarter in ""the next couple of weeks,"" with the final product supposed to ship some time soon after that. After the product's repeated delays and seeing the current state of the Dash, I have strong doubts about this time frame, but this skepticism didn't dim my enthusiasm for the product itself. Even in a half-finished state I could see its appeal.   Once you’ve fitted the Dash buds snugly in your ears you tap them to start playing audio. Tapping and swiping on the right earpiece controls your music, while the left is dedicated to activity tracking. Tap once on the right bud to play whatever's up first in the internal memory, tap twice to cycle through playlists, and swipe up and down for volume, or left and right to skip tracks. It’s simple enough to remember, but the system has a few drawbacks. For a start, if you tap the Dash too hard and push the buds deeper inside your ear canal, the action can be a little painful and sounds ugly — try tapping on your ear canal now to see what I mean. Secondly, the gesture commands themselves aren't that precise, which leads to more insistent taps and more ear pain. By the end of my brief session with the Dash I was getting better at controlling it, but for this to be a truly ""intuitive"" product, as its makers claim, there needs to be some improvement here. On the positive side, you can just stream music to the Dash directly from your phone or tablet via a Bluetooth connection, and Bragi says it's going to implement motion controls using the Dash’s accelerometers. In the future, says Sarac, users will be able to activate the Dash’s fitness tracking mode simply by jumping up and down on the spot, or receive a spoken weather report by looking up into the sky. There will also, he says, be the option to program your own movement macros using the Dash’s app, though at the moment, the only working motion control is that the Dash automatically pauses music when one earbud is removed. It's a convenient feature, but more are needed.   The earbuds themselves are fairly anonymous pieces of plastic, with gently pulsing LEDs that let you know that they're turned on. They're charged in a rechargeable carry case which can top up the batteries multiple times — a much needed option, as a full battery for the Dash only lasts 3 hours. The buds also offer a noise-cancelation feature as well as the option to feed through audio from your immediate environment using external microphones, which are toggled by swiping forward on the left earbud. Testing these earphones outside near a sound system, the noise-canceling wasn’t the best I’ve heard, although this might have been because the buds I had weren’t quite the right size for me (the retail version will come with sleeves to fit 97 percent of ears, says Sarac). The audio passthrough, though, was incredibly good, allowing me to listen to music and hold a perfectly legible conversation while the thumps of the nearby speakers were dimmed to a background pulse. This mode would be fantastic for anyone who likes to listen to music while they bike, allowing them to stay aware of their surroundings. The audio quality was impressive too, with both classical and rock music sounding equally rich and full on the little buds — although that's to be expected from a product that will cost around $299 when it finally goes on sale. both the sound quality and audio passthrough were impressive Overall, though, my verdict on the Dashes — like the product itself — has to be delayed. I’m now sold on the idea of wireless earbuds, especially those that turn on automatically when you put them in, that allow you to easily skip through favorite playlists, that track your runs and even give you live feedback on how far you’ve gone with a nod of your head. But this is the dream of the product and not the thing itself. What I tried were some good quality wireless earbuds with touch controls.

They can hover over swaying flowers and gather nectar in the dark — conditions that would make most diurnal animals, like us, essentially blind. That's why researchers have taken a special interest in figuring out how these insects see at night. The finding, published today in Science, suggests that scientists have figured it out — and the new knowledge could one day help researchers build tiny robots that can fly in varying light conditions, without crash-landing in a tree. The moths slowed their visual system  To make the discovery, researchers put hawkmoths in front of robotic flowers in low light. The moths slowed their visual system down to collect more light over long periods of time, the researchers discovered. The change in moths' brains resembles what a photographer does when she slows a camera's shutter speed. It's a crazy adaptation that comes with some drawbacks, but it helps the moths see far more clearly than you and I ever could.   Credit: Rob Felt, Georgia Tech Hawkmoths are equipped with ""superposition compound eyes"" that allow them to see a thousand times more sensitively than insects with regular compound eyes in low light. It’s a powerful adaptation, but to see at night, they need to see a million times more sensitively than insects with more conventional eyes. Clearly, moths have another trick up their sleeves. So, biologists came up with an experiment designed to test the hawkmoth's vision under various lighting conditions. Moths need to see a million times more sensitively than insects with conventional eyes The researchers built a flower-shaped robot filled with an aromatic mixture known to initiate foraging behaviors in moths. The robotic flower was programmed to sway and jitter at different speeds. Then, the scientists released female hawkmoths in a lab under light conditions that matched those seen in the late afternoon and mid-dusk. The researchers also filmed the moths as they tried to keep up with their scented targets. Thanks to the moving flowers, the researchers were able to determine that hawkmoths lose some of their precision and begin to lag behind swaying flowers when they move above a certain speed, in very low light. ""[The moth] sees more poorly following motions that are above 2 hertz,"" says Simon Sponberg, at biologist at Georgia Tech and a co-author of the study — a frequency that's equivalent to the robot flower swaying back and forth twice in a single second. But slowing their visual systems would affect their flight Sponberg and his team created a computer model of the moths' behavior; it suggested that if the insects slowed their visual systems to catch more light, it would affect their flight. The model predicted that at certain frequencies of flower movement, the moths would overshoot the flower, moving past where the plant ended up — and that’s exactly what happened when they replicated the conditions in the lab with live moths.  Sponberg lab, Georgia tech ""We found that at exactly those frequencies, the moth overshot the flower by exactly the amount we predicted it would,"" Sponberg explains. Their researchers concluded that the moth's visual system acts kind of like a camera does at lower shutter speeds. When the moth slows its visual processing, it sees better in dim light — but if an object moves too quickly, the moth sees a blur. So what happens when a flower sways too quickly in nature? As it turns out, that doesn't happen too often. ""Flowers move at all kinds of frequencies, but 95 percent of their motions are below 2 hertz,"" Sponberg says. By observing five species of flowers commonly targeted by hawkmoths in their natural setting, the researchers were able to conclude that the moths had figured out a way to slow down their visual system just enough to let light in for longer periods, without compromising their ability to see swaying flowers in dim light. Flowers rarely sway above 2 hertz Either that, or the flowers figured out a way to avoid swaying so fast that moths can’t keep up with them. Moths are pollinators after all, so letting them gather nectar benefits the flowers, too. In truth, the answer might be a combination of both — but it’s too early to tell.   Credit: Rob Felt, Georgia Tech ""Nocturnal insects have exquisite visual abilities at night."" ""Nocturnal insects have exquisite visual abilities at night,"" says Eric Warrant, a zoologist at Lund University in Sweden who didn’t participate in the study. Over the last 20 years, Warrant’s lab has helped show that nocturnal insects can see color, learn visual landmarks and use them for homing and navigation, and navigate using the celestial polarization pattern formed around the Moon or by the Milky Way. For him, the results of the Sponberg study adds ""yet another piece to the growing body of evidence indicating that nocturnal insects see extremely well."" The finding is intriguing, both from a neuroscience and an evolutionary perspective. But studying how hawkmoths see at night isn’t just about advancing our understanding of evolutionary theory. Researchers who wish to build flying robots for rescue missions may want to take a page from the hawkmoths’ book. ""Insects are capable of doing many of the things that we desire autonomous vehicles and robots to achieve, and also in a miniature package,"" Warrant says. Understanding the principles by which a flying nocturnal insect negotiates the world, or tracks wind-tossed flowers, could therefore provide clues to achieving the same precision in a flying robot.  ""By understanding how animals see in low light, we can get some better senses of how we might be able to do that as well,"" Sponberg says.",0.7426701171388164,0.25732988286118363,0.8375113436370943,958,5.0167014613778704,476,6.0714285714285712,1,4,"Science, Report"

More than television and more than the web, social media has given us an insight into the work and everyday experiences of astronauts. But just as fun as watching them cavort in low gravity, is looking on as they get used to Earth all over again. Over the past few days, as half of the International Space Station's Expedition 43 has travelled back home, we've been able to watch not only their descent, but also their re-acclimatization to the sights and sounds of our home planet. Italy's Samantha Cristoforetti and America's Terry Virts have both been tweeting about their experiences, and it's satisfying to see the change in their messages. Previously, they were showing off experiences that were normal to them but amazing to us (The darkness of space! Earth from above! Zero gravity!), but now they're tweeting about things that are normal to us but amazing to them (The taste of peaches! Rain! Not zero gravity!).  1st morning in temporary Houston home, enjoying sounds, smells, flavors of Earth. Doing great, but gravity is tough! pic.twitter.com/IFCzgEW4h5 First rain back on earth.

Most of them are physical, with the time spent in zero gravity leading to muscle loss, weaker bones, and oddities like vision difficulties — the latter due to the changing pressures on the eyeballs. Chris Hadfield, who returned to Earth in 2013, even reported shifts in how he spoke: ""Right after I landed, I could feel the weight of my lips and tongue and I had to change how I was talking ... I hadn't realized that I learned to talk with a weightless tongue."" ""I hadn't realized that I learned to talk with a weightless tongue."" And the experience is as much psychological as it is physiological, with astronauts commonly reporting profound changes to their outlook on the world. ""You see how diminutive your life and concerns are compared to other things In the universe,"" said former NASA astronaut Edward Gibson, who worked in the space station Skylab, the US precursor to the ISS. ""The result is that you enjoy the life that is before you… It allows you to have inner peace."" Expedition 43's tweets are a reminder that our perception of what's new, enjoyable, or exciting is as much a matter of perspective as anything else: one person's everyday experience is another's out-of-this-world adventure.

Now, his doctors have some more good news to share: the transplant recipient is going to be a father, the BBC reports. His partner is about four months pregnant. ""It is a milestone for him."" ""This is what we intended, that he should be able to stand up and be able to urinate and have intercourse, so it is a milestone for him,"" Andre Van der Merwe, the surgeon who led the operation and the head of urology at Stellenbosch University, told the BBC. The December penis transplant took nine hours to complete. By March, the patient's organ was ""fully functional,"" his doctors said. The recovery happened far more quickly than expected; Van der Merwe thought the patient would recover within two years.  Traditional circumcisions like the one the patient underwent are risky affairs; they often don't take place in sterile environments. As a result, penis amputations aren't uncommon in South Africa. And unfortunately, for this type of organ harvest, obtaining the consent of a donor's family can be difficult. In this case, the family agreed after Van de Merwe and his team promised to use leftover skin to make a penis-like appendage for the donor's body. A penis transplant had to be reversed in 2006 ""The family is much happier to send the body to the grave with something resembling a penis,"" Van der Merwe told Bloomberg in March. This wasn't the first penis transplant attempt, but it is certainly the most successful. The first such operation took place in China, in 2006. Doctors spent 15 hours attaching a penis to a 44-year-old patient, but the procedure had to be reversed two weeks later.

Learn more. Yelp is a weird social media platform. It's not a broadcasting tool like Facebook or Twitter, but it's no longer a straight reviews site, either. In the past few years, it's become a common venue for quasi-political protest — and as of earlier this week, it can be a venue for actual political protest, as the federal government can now respond to reviews of its monuments, TSA checkpoints, and other public services. The intended purpose of this, of course, is to let people rate employee behavior and practical things like cleanliness. But Republican presidential candidate Carly Fiorina jumped on it almost immediately, posting a one-star TSA review that doubled as a campaign pitch. Other candidates don't seem to have followed suit yet, but it may only be a matter of time. It's hard to be apolitical about elected officials and wars There's nowhere better to complain about government than Washington, DC, whose Yelp page currently lists around 1,300 entries under the overall ""Public Services and Government"" category. The vast majority of visible reviews are about as helpful as the average restaurant or store rating — frequently more so, given how many history buffs and political wonks DC tourism attracts. And the listings aren't all for federal (or even American, since embassies are quite popular) government locations. But it's easy for political grandstanding to start slipping in, given how many of the most popular spots are dedicated to elected officials and wars. A reasonable number of monument visitors are just excited about America. Others aren't able to resist a quick political jab at the Lincoln Memorial: Or they're not so keen on the premise of the Jefferson Memorial itself.   Then you hit the Capitol, where people start remembering that they actually hate politicians. Or the White House, where you should probably be ashamed for voting for whoever is living in it, or maybe voting, period. Or the Supreme Court, whose page is a great little snapshot of whatever major case was going on at the time of the review. (The second one was hidden and doesn't factor into star ratings, something that also happened to Fiorina's review.) Fiorina's TSA page isn't a Washington-based listing, but her non-recommended review still isn't the best one by a long shot. I have no idea what is going on here, but I like it.   So what does Yelp like? Well, here's its top 100 listings for the District of Columbia, collected this morning.

The bulk of the data is divided between 10 tgz or ""tarball"" files, along with a 7z mail archive file named for Avid Life Media CEO Noel Biderman.   For most observers, the email archive was the most tempting, promising internal communications and potentially more insight into the lawsuit over fake profiles that Ashley Madison fended off earlier this year. But our attempts to open the archive yielded an error message, and we weren't the only ones. The file appears to have been corrupted during the archiving process, and while it's still possible that the attackers will release an uncorrupted version of the file later on, it's also possible the data was corrupted during retrieval and is simply unrecoverable in its current form. It still may be possible to retrieve portions of the data using more advanced forensics, but whatever is retrieved will likely be incomplete.   Aside from the email archive, most of the data in the tgz files constitute source code for Avid Life Media's various web sites, including Ashley Madison itself and the couple-swapping site Swappernet. The code shows the back end for the sites, detailing architecture for various forms and password modules. Much of the recent development work is also visible in the code, including recent patches and commits made by ALM's developers. That goes a long way towards verifying Impact Team's claim to have extensive access to ALM servers, but it doesn't do much beyond that. It's possible that Impact Team has more in store, and corrupted or not, the inclusion of the Biderman archive suggests at least the possibility of access to internal email archives, an unsettling and powerful technique in previous hacks.

That's why I was so surprised when last week I found myself riding shotgun in an 18-wheel big rig that, at the flip of a switch on the steering wheel, drove itself down the highways of Las Vegas. I was in the Freightliner Inspiration, the world’s first road-ready self-driving truck. It uses the ""Highway Pilot"" system that parent company Daimler, which hosted the event, first previewed when it announced it was testing it in the Mercedes Future Truck 2025. Self-driving cars are another one of these technologies that aren’t as far out on the horizon as, say, a flying car. They’re something we’ve learned a lot about in the last few years, and many companies are working on them. Porting this technology into the trucking world raises a whole new crop of problems, however. Regulatory and political barriers are preventing states from even allowing this to be tested, and aside from that there are massive technical challenges that stand in the way of the whole system working, too. But that didn’t stop Daimler from making a monumental deal out of its own entry into the market. Daimler, which has over 40 percent of the US trucking market, brought nearly 200 members of the press to a parking lot adjacent to the Las Vegas Motor Speedway. We passed through a giant arch that read ""Freightliner Proving Ground,"" and found an oasis of giant white tents. The Inspiration was teased to the press at this location early in the afternoon, but it was quickly driven off the premises by Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval and Dr. Wolfgang Bernhard, the head of Daimler Trucks North America, almost as soon as the giant car cover was removed. (It was unclear whether they let the truck drive itself once they got on the road.) They were saving the official reveal for that evening, when we were brought to the Hoover Dam. There, the company had organized an event befitting the locale: there was a 45-minute presentation projected onto nearly the entire 726-foot height of the dam that included a brief history lesson of Freightliner, another of the dam’s construction, and a live discussion with Daimler’s executives hosted by Rutledge Wood, host of the US version of Top Gear. After all of that, the Inspiration truck finally wound its way down the roads on the Arizona side until it made its way across the Hoover Dam. (It was unclear whether the truck drove itself onto the dam.) For many reasons, Daimler has a right to be excited. By partly automating its trucking system, the company could offer trucks that are more fuel efficient, cutting down on emissions (up to 5 percent, Daimler claims). It works, but the many obstacles loom large. The truck that Daimler debuted last week is one of only two that are licensed to drive on public roads in Nevada, and only four other states allow testing of autonomous vehicles right now. (Arizona isn’t one of them, which makes the decision to debut the truck by driving over a landmark that spans two states a bit laughable.) That’s a big issue; you can’t perform any interstate commerce if you can’t go between states. But it’s also a problem because Nevada has a particularly stable climate, which means that the 10,000 miles of testing on the Inspiration Truck have been pretty homogenous, something Bernhard freely admits. ""We still have to see how this thing performs in the rain, the sun, cold days, subzero [temperatures], and very hot,"" he says. Perhaps as problematic as the regulatory issues Daimler faces is that the Highway Pilot system — for now, at least — relies on well-painted safety lines on the roads that the trucks drive down. If the lines aren’t clearly visible to the truck’s cameras, the system just won’t work. That may sound like a negligible issue, but we’re notoriously bad at maintaining our infrastructure as a country. The next day we returned to the Proving Ground to find six trucks — two Inspirations, two of the company’s aerodynamic SuperTrucks, and two of its Cascadia trucks, which the Inspiration is based on. I hopped into the Inspiration and found a spartan, futuristic cab — there was a dynamic, full-color LCD display in front of the driver and a Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 to his right embedded in the smooth dashboard that curved down to the hardwood floors. The Freightliner driver took us out of the speedway grounds and onto Nevada State Route 604. Less than a mile down the highway, the truck alerted him that the Highway Pilot system was available. He tapped a button, took his hands and feet off the wheel and pedals, and our 20-ton vehicle was driving itself. We meandered down the right lane of SR604 until it met up with Interstate 15, which we took back to the speedway. All the on- and off-ramps were handled manually, which meant only a portion of the drive was autonomous. For the most part, the ride was unremarkable, which is essentially the whole point. There was just one slight curve in SR604 that afforded the only uneasy moment; while there was no doubt in my mind the truck would make it through, my gut definitely felt otherwise. In between thumb twiddling and glances out the driver’s side window, my driver-turned-passenger explained that the cameras in the windshield and the radar in the front bumper will assess road conditions in real time and tell the driver whether the Highway Pilot system is available. For the purposes of the day’s demonstrations, however, there were GPS-designated zones on each highway that made the autopilot system operable. The driver is in control of the speed — Inspiration doesn’t have the ability to read speed limit signs — and if the Highway Pilot deems the road unsuitable or notices an obstacle ahead, it will begin visual and audible countdowns and alarms. To regain control, the driver simply returns his hands to the wheel. Representatives spent both days talking ad nauseam about how Highway Pilot won’t completely obsolesce the role of the truck driver, which is clearly a critical component to gaining acceptance from truck drivers and their supporters. Daimler president and CEO Martin Daum said it will ""enhance"" the driver’s capabilities, and Bernhard says it makes the job ""much more attractive."" They envision a world where the driver has more time to manage the logistics of the trip, but it’s easy to see why people might be concerned about other distractions. Bernhard said there’s no plan to install sensors or cameras to ensure a driver doesn’t nap or play Angry Birds during the drive, but Daimler might not have to — for now, even with the autopilot engaged, accident liability remains with the driver. That’s as good of a motivation to keep a driver in his seat as any. While Nevada might not let Daimler test a panoply of climates, the state’s long, straight, hypnosis-inducing roads did let the company test driver drowsiness. ""The results of our research are very clear,"" Bernhard says. ""We measured brain activity with [and] without autonomous function. It clearly shows that driver drowsiness decreases by about 25 percent when the truck is operating in autonomous mode."" That’s a big deal, because driver fatigue is one of the leading causes of the hundreds of thousands of large truck crashes that happen annually, and those result in some 4,000 deaths. As the Inspiration Truck drove us down the sun-baked highway, it was easy to see how the semi-autonomous capabilities could help. The wheel twisted back and forth as the Highway Pilot system guided the truck between the boundaries of our lane, fighting the wind and the truck’s momentum. All that correction would normally be done by the driver, and on long drives that take up nearly half a day, all those little corrections add up. But buried in the multiple speeches across the two-day event, one talking point kept emerging that made little sense. While Bernhard and Daum boasted about how the Inspiration Truck would eventually mitigate driver drowsiness, they both spoke about how automating part of the whole process will let drivers make longer runs. At one point, Daum even said that it’s up to Daimler to prove to regulators ""that driver fatigue is decreased, so guys who use support systems can have longer hours of service."" Whatever the case, Daimler is still a long way off from integrating this technology into its entire fleet, something the company admits in the supplemental press materials from last week’s event. There, the company says its goal is to offer Highway Pilot ""in the middle of the coming decade."" That's a good thing, because a lot of these issues like regulations and infrastructure still need to be resolved. There is a wealth of others, too — Highway Pilot isn't as aware of its surroundings as something like Google's self-driving car, even though the two are both considered ""level 3"" autonomous. None of these will be settled easily. One thing Daimler says it won't do is speed up adoption by licensing the technology. Not only could that cut into its stranglehold on the market, the company claims that, since it’s been specifically built to run with its own drivetrain, Highway Pilot would require too much retooling for another trucking company to integrate. So until Daimler’s autopilot is fully developed, its drivers will have to tackle the highways the old-fashioned way: stay awake at all costs.",0.5901303055828626,0.4098696944171374,0.5313466503109122,1601,4.9225484072454719,764,6.2068062827225132,0,16,"Transportation, Report, Watch This"

The company’s cars — like the iconic 911 — are an emotional buy, inspired by sights, sounds, and even a little fear, which no mobile device or online platform can offer. “We’re a visceral brand,” Porsche’s VP of Marketing, Andre Oosthuizen, acknowledges. “In a sense there’s no better way to describe us than ‘analog.’ To experience what we’ve put forward, you need to slip behind the wheel.” Last Thursday the automaker opened its new Porsche Experience Center and North American headquarters just south of Atlanta, an impressive 27-acre complex which it hopes will generate passion, spark personal stories, and sell cars. It lies about half a mile from the end of runway 8-26 at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport, the world’s busiest aviation hub by passenger volume. A ceaseless stream of airliners arriving and departing literally buzz the facility all day, bringing some 95 million passengers through Atlanta.     Porsche’s $100 million investment in the combined facility at One Porsche Drive is its largest outside of Germany. The capital sunk into it reflects the importance of the US market to Porsche, one of its two largest along with China. Though it remains a quasi-boutique brand, Porsche sold more cars in America in 2014 (over 48,000) than at any time since entering the US market 65 years ago. Ironically, the complex actually sits on land previously occupied by Ford’s Hapeville Assembly plant, which opened in 1947, and it employs clever reuse of the old plant’s elements like wooden power poles and untouched concrete blocks from the 1950s discovered during construction. Designed by Formula 1 architect Tilke Engineering, Porsche’s 1.6-mile driver development track — adjacent to the Experience Center and headquarters building — combines a challenging handling circuit, low-friction circle (skidpad), and a low-friction handling circuit with an off-road course. Blasting around it at near triple-digit speeds in any of Porsche’s cars from the 911 Turbo to the Cayenne SUV is thrilling and a bit intimidating. It’s meant to be: no matter how well done, a virtual facsimile can’t simulate the risky feeling associated with speed. ""Going through the esses, the side barriers seem close but they’re almost psychological barriers,"" Oosthuizen enthuses. ""Coming out of the [last] corner accelerating toward the building is phenomenal.""     Porsche has worked to minimize the chances of anyone getting hurt, though the track barriers will undoubtedly meet some sheet metal occasionally. Drivers will always be paired with a coach who’ll tailor the experience to their interests, whether that’s limit-handling at speed, tackling a 70-degree hill on the off-road course, or simply evaluating the next Porsche they’d like to buy. And with the installation of in-car cameras in the future, Porsche hopes you’ll share video via your social media platform of choice. The same applies inside the adjacent building, where the company is making sharing your tour across services from Periscope to Snapchat as easy as possible. Situated across the four floors of One Porsche Drive are a classic car gallery and archive, a restoration center, a driving simulator lab, a human performance center, and a fine dining restaurant. The gallery features significant Porsches from private collections and Porsche’s own museum. On display are race cars from a 1,100-horsepower 1972 917/30 to a 1986 959 Paris-Dakar Rally Raid racer. Street-going versions of the 911 and 356 are on display as well. Not only will the gallery change periodically, but individuals can, for a substantial fee, display their own cars there. After perusing the gallery and the restoration center — where historic Porsches are revitalized with vintage German parts — you can try your hand at racing tracks around the world against other drivers in the Center’s driving simulator lab with its five sophisticated simulators and instructors. The human performance center comes complete with advanced fitness equipment and personnel to evaluate your physical and psychological performance, critical metrics to have before getting behind the wheel of an actual race car. How many people will routinely use these facilities is up for speculation, but the 356 Restaurant — named after Porsche’s first production vehicle — should see a steady flow of business.     Porsche anticipates around 30,000 visitors a year, and anyone is welcome, Porsche owner or not — you just have to pre-register. A visit can be as casual as booking a table at the restaurant, to simple walk-throughs, to guided tours and driving experiences, all the way up to taking delivery of your new Porsche on-premises. Wheel time on Porsche’s track starts at $300 for an hour and a half with a Boxster, and up to $750 to try both the 911 Turbo and the hardcore GT3. Corporate groups are also welcome to tour, host meetings, and even stage elaborate dinners in the gallery. The company could benefit from the unique layout of the facility, too: combining the Experience Center with Porsche’s headquarters offices and its consulting and finance arms means employees will literally mingle with visitors daily, potentially gaining useful insights in the process. There’s honestly nothing else like the newest Porsche Experience Center, though the automaker is building another in Los Angeles set to debut next year. It joins similar Centers in Germany, England, and planned facilities in France, Russia, and Turkey. It’s a formula which may soon be copied by competitors like Mercedes, which is relocating to Atlanta itself. As a tool for selling cars and building the brand, Porsche is on to something here. The scale of the place and myriad details inside from interactive games to historical photos — and of course the cars themselves — will undoubtedly impress. It’s not a cliché to say that visitors will come away with a story. That’s exactly the benefit Porsche is looking for.",0.7939046527038105,0.2060953472961895,0.5830808570968817,980,5.2877551020408164,561,6.4919786096256686,0,34,"Transportation, Photo Essay, Report"

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has now taken over the investigation — which could last weeks, or months — but The Wall Street Journal is already reporting that the train is believed to have been traveling over 100 miles per hour near a curve designed for a speed limit of just 50. How does that happen? Human error is all too real in every form of transportation — operator fatigue or carelessness can certainly cause a train to go too fast, and it sometimes does with tragic results — but the technology to stop trains from going too fast already exists. It's called Positive Train Control (PTC), and it will be federally mandated on major railways nationwide by the end of this year — a controversial requirement that many in the rail industry have attempted to delay. PTC is designed specifically to avoid collisions and overspeed derailments through a system of transponders and GPS receivers that allow computers to take over when an operator isn't handling the locomotive correctly. Even more tragically, though, Amtrak has already been trying to implement its own version of PTC, called ACSES, throughout the Northeast Corridor — the segment of track that carries thousands of commuters between Washington DC, New York City, Boston, and points in between. According to a report in Amtrak's employee newsletter from earlier this year, the company's implementation was operational from Boston to New Haven; New Brunswick to Trenton, New Jersey; and Perryville, Maryland to Wilmington, Delaware. The entire Northeast Corridor has been promised PTC for several years, but as of this year's report, Amtrak is still trying to finish installation. It's unclear whether PTC was operational on the specific section where 188 derailed, but there is no indication that it was — and a Reuters report quotes unnamed officials that PTC was not installed on that specific train. ""I do not know right now whether or not Amtrak's PTC system called ACSES has been installed and is operational on all four tracks on this line north of Philly. If it was installed and operational it should have prevented the derailment,"" says Steve Ditmeyer, an adjunct railway professor at Michigan State University. This isn't the first time PTC — or the lack thereof — has been cited as a contributing factor in an accident. It's widely believed that the 2013 MTA Metro-North derailment, where a train came off the tracks going 82 miles per hour in a 30 mph zone, could have been prevented had PTC been able to take over.

The next car to bear the Spirit of Ecstasy, it turns out, will be called ""Dawn."" Most automakers don't get a news cycle for the announcement of the name of a new model, but then again, a new Rolls-Royce is kind of a big deal: in the past decade-plus, there have been only three badges on Rollers — Phantom, Ghost, and Wraith. And even if you go back through the last century, Rolls-Royce has only used about a dozen different names for its vehicles, give or take. ""Dawn"" evokes the Silver Dawn name, used in the 1950s on a dramatic drophead (pictured above). The new car will be a drophead as well — a four-seat convertible — when it launches early next year.  Really, though, nothing I could possibly write is as unapologetically Rolls-Royce as the company's own press release: ‘Dawn' perfectly expresses the character of the new Rolls-Royce. In its tentative, inchoate, anticipatory state, dawn is the world coming to light from the ethereal dark of the night. The early-day chill of dawn provides an erotic tingle on the skin, awakening the senses and passions as the day begins. Like Eleanor Thornton, thought by many to be the inspiration behind the Spirit of Ecstasy, the Rolls-Royce Dawn will also prove itself to be the muse that leads its owner to believe that at the start of the day, anything is possible. The new Rolls-Royce Dawn is beguilingly visceral. It excites both men and women - they want it, they need it and they want to immerse themselves in it. It is languid and beautiful, fresh and fragrant and awakens the passion of your life.

Nestled in a dense block of 19th-century buildings, the sloping glass structure looks like a metallic armadillo shell, but is in fact a new project from world-renowned architecture firm Renzo Piano Building Workshop. The building was commissioned by the Fondation Jérôme Seydoux-Pathé, a research organization dedicated to the history of cinema through the lens of Pathé — one of the world's oldest and most celebrated production companies. The foundation tapped Piano’s firm to help build its new headquarters in 2006, located at the site of an old movie theater commonly known as the Rodin cinema. (As a young artist, Auguste Rodin created two sculptures for the building's facade.) There was already a rectangular building behind the historic facade, but it filled up an entire courtyard lined with apartment buildings, and Piano wanted to liberate the space. The practical solution, according to lead architect Thorsten Sahlmann, was something more organic. ""It was not that we just wanted to design an animal,"" Sahlmann says. ""It was more that this organic shape better fit to the constraints of the site. We created useful space for the foundation while giving air and light to the neighbors living around. We couldn’t do this with a more rectangular-shaped building."" The glass top of the shell is supported by curved wooden beams and covered in semi-transparent aluminum panels, with a spiral staircase connecting the floors. Inside are the foundation’s offices, a 70-person screening room, and extensive archives — more than 10,000 films, most of which are silent. Most important, the building’s curvaceous design freed up more space in the courtyard, allowing room for a new garden and letting more natural light filter down.  When viewed from above, the building seems as if it would stick out against the Haussmann-era buildings in Paris' 13th arrondissement — a bulbous, contemporary growth along the city’s historic skyline. City authorities have gone to great lengths to preserve Paris' landscape, implementing strict building restrictions and famously limiting the heights of new constructions to only a few stories. But some architects have pushed for a relaxation of these regulations, with architect Jean Nouvel saying in 2008 that it’s time ""to stop thinking of Paris as a museum city."" Architects have pushed for a relaxation of strict building regulations   The Renzo Piano Building Workshop has plenty of experience melding the historic with the modern, having created the urbanist Centre Georges Pompidou art museum in central Paris, and built the Morgan Library in New York under similarly tight urban constraints. The key, Sahlmann says, is ""keeping a layer of the history"" without overwhelming it. ""The facade is a layer of the 19th century, and we’re adding a piece that's quite in-scale and respectful of what is existing,"" he explains, noting that the new structure is barely visible at street level. ""The building is not on the street crying, 'Here I am!' It's stepping away and sitting there, waiting for somebody to discover it."" The Fondation Jérôme Seydoux-Pathé is scheduled to open on September 10th. All images copyright and published with the permission of Michel Denancé  An overhead view of the foundation's glass shell, when it was still under construction. The building was constructed in a small courtyard in Paris' 13th arrondissement. Viewed from the street, the shell is much less imposing. The 19th-century facade of the site includes two sculptures created by a young Auguste Rodin.  The building's undulating contours resulted in more space and sunlight for the foundation's neighbors. Translucent aluminum panels line the outside of the structure, creating the illusion of an armadillo shell.   From behind the facade, Piano's new building seems to grow out of neighboring apartments.  The space will house the foundation's offices, exhibition spaces, and a 70-person screening room.  The Fondation Jérôme Seydoux-Pathé houses an archive of more than 10,000 old films, of which 9,000 are silent.

As one of several ""Thiel Fellows,"" Proud received a $100,000 grant from esteemed venture capitalist Peter Thiel to skip college, move to San Francisco, and start working in tech. Thiel didn’t expect anything in return, and Proud didn’t deliver — until now. Proud, now 22, is today announcing Hello Inc and its first product Sense, a glowing polycarbonate orb that monitors sleep patterns and everything that happens in your bedroom in hopes of helping you catch a few more z’s. Sense is available for preorder today on Kickstarter for $99. If Sense reaches its funding goal of $100,000 it will ship in Q4 2014 for a retail price of $129.   Sense measures temperature, light, motion, humidity, sound, and even the particle counts for pollen and dust in the air. It also includes a tiny circular ""Sleep Pill"" that clips onto your pillowcase. Like most sleep trackers, the Pill records your sleep patterns by measuring how much you move in your sleep, but without asking you to wear a wristband or strap a sensor to your mattress. The two gadgets report back to your iOS or Android device through the Sense app over Bluetooth. When you glance at the app in the morning, it displays a timeline of the prior evening. It might show you that at 3AM, you tossed and turned a bit because some lights came on, and at 6AM, your dog started howling, which caused some more stirring. Sense includes a microphone that listens to your room as you sleep, so it can actually play back the noises that woke you. Proud fed hundreds of sound samples into Sense — many of them snoring samples from YouTube — so the app might display ""snoring"" instead of ""abrupt sound at 3AM."" Sense for iPhone screenshotsPreviousNextView full GalleryPreviousNext It’s a useful feature, but a risky one to include — Google’s acquisition of Nest drew fervent skepticism about its potential for privacy intrusions, and Sense’s microphone will likely elicit a similar response. Fortunately, Sense only records sound spikes, not all sounds, and stores sounds on your phone and not in the cloud. Also, Sense’s mic only turns on once you’ve stopped moving and gone to bed. ""It’s not always recording,"" says Proud. ""There’s a rolling 5-second window where it listens for loud events like a truck or dog."" The goal of Sense, like most fitness trackers and quantified-self devices, is to provide transparency — or ""sleep intelligence,"" as Hello Inc calls it. There are some cute features, like a built-in LED that makes Sense glow green if your room’s conducive to a good night’s sleep — and it only turns on once you’ve turned off the lights. A yellow or orange glow means you should check the app to see what’s wrong. If the air’s too smoggy, you might want to replace the filter in your central air unit. If the room’s too bright, you might want to invest in some blackout drapes. Common sense goes a long way towards better sleep, but Sense hopes to go further. Sense sleep tracker imagesPreviousNextView full GalleryPreviousNext ""With this, you can know every single night what’s going on,"" he says. Over time, the Sense app will offer advice like ""You sleep best when the temperature is between 61 and 68 degrees, lower your thermostat?"" or insights like ""In the past month, you’ve gone to sleep an average of 38 minutes earlier than usual."" If you hear recurring sounds in your Sense log, you might even discover that you have a sleep disorder. ""A large number of people are never diagnosed with this stuff."" About 18 million Americans have moderate to severe sleep apnea, in fact, and 75 percent of them don’t know it, according to the The New York Times. Sense isn’t designed to diagnose any medical conditions, but could easily pick up the midnight coughing fits you didn’t know you had. James Proud Sense might ask you to change a lot of things about your room or your habits, but there’s one problem Sense solves completely on its own. Like the Jawbone UP and other sleep trackers, Sense can wake you up once you’ve finished a REM cycle — instead of in the middle of one. In David Pierce’s tests of the Jawbone UP band, he felt ""fantastic"" every time it nudged him awake, even if it was 30 minutes earlier than his alarm would have. Proud is convinced, however, that people don’t want to wear technology to bed. ""What if you could take everything in a wearable and embed it in a pillow?"" Proud asks. ""You should ideally be able to get into bed, wake up, and not have to check buttons or charge up or sync anything."" The Sleep Pill, as it's called, will need to be replaced yearly. A final price hasn’t yet been decided for replacement Pills. ""You should ideally be able to get into bed, wake up, and not have to check buttons or charge up."" Even if Sense works as stated, it’s going to be challenging to convince consumers to invite one more piece of technology into their bedroom. Proud seems to understand this. The promotional trailer for Sense is set to the same music as the movie trailer for Spike Jonze’s Her, a film about man’s intimate relationship with a new kind of technology. Assuming it works, Sense or something like it might come standard in the bedrooms of the future. After a while, Sense’s alarm clock function might be the only feature you really notice, but for $99, that alone could be worth it. ""The one thing wearables have made people realize is that this is an important area,"" says Proud.

Framed was a simple screen with a PC behind it that could display all manner of web content by interfacing with a smartphone. Just two weeks ago, American startup Electric Objects launched its EO1 picture frame, which is very similar to Framed, onto Kickstarter. It's already shot past its $25,000 crowdfunding goal twenty times over— its total currently stands at over $500,000. Despite bringing Framed to commercial customers and select artists back in 2012, Nakamura's frame has never been widely available. Now, the designer and his business associate William Lai are launching a consumer-focused frame through their company FRM with a Kickstarter campaign. Is there room in the world for two ""connected"" frames? Outwardly, ""Framed 2.0"" and the EO1 are very similar. Both offer a high-resolution display that hides a tiny computer beneath. Both are capable of showcasing static and moving artwork on their displays, and both can be controlled with a smartphone. But they're not carbon copies of one another. While Electric Objects' effort sticks closely to the 2011 Framed concept unveiled by Nakamura, the new Framed adds a few extras that weren't in its original launch three years ago.   FRM wants to help digital artists monetize their creations In addition to smartphone integration, Framed allows you to control its interface through gesture and voice. These inputs can also be utilized by artists to display more interactive digital forms, and Framed also has speakers where EO1 does not. FRM is also offering a pair of sizes: a 24-inch model at $399, or a 40-inch version priced at $1,500. Both prices represent special prices for Kickstarter early birds, and at the time of writing both limited tiers are still available. The company expects to ship the majority of its frames in early 2015 (although delivery is predicted for later this year for some more-expensive tiers). The real difference between Framed and the EO1 isn't in the products themselves, but rather what FRM and Electric Objects are trying to achieve through their respective products. Framed is not only a digital picture frame, but also of a new store for digital art. FRM wants to help digital artists monetize their creations by launching the Framed Store with the support of a number of prominent artists. While EO1's makers are also promoting original art with an Artist in Residency program and say there'll be an ""app store"" of sorts, FRM's efforts are geared towards Framed becoming the Kindle store of digital art. Chances are the average person hasn't heard of Universal Everything, Mirai Mizue, Aaron Koblin, or any of the collaborators FRM has lined up. Yet all of the above are embedded in the digital art scene, and many have created works that thousands if not millions of people have seen and enjoyed. FRM believes that, if people are going to buy a product specifically to display digital art, they will be willing to purchase original works to display on that frame. It's not a particularly wild premise, but it nonetheless could transform and the digital art community if it succeeds. ""Our mission is to collaboratively push the medium forward."" ""We’re focused on helping artists deliver a unique experience to users,"" FRM co-founder William Lai tells The Verge. ""We’re especially excited about how this transforms the community, and how this opens up new possibilities for artists and creators in general."" After just 48 hours, FRM has doubled the $75,000 its Kickstarter campaign asked for.

But in the near future, it could be replaced entirely with a city of 190,000 people. At least if London Mayor Boris Johnson gets his way. In order to keep up with skyrocketing demand projected for Heathrow into 2050s, Johnson years ago began advocating that Heathrow be closed and a new airport be built 40 miles east on a rural island in the Thames Estuary. He's faced tremendous opposition from national politicians in the UK, and the latest environmental studies appear to have all but grounded the proposal. Still, the London Mayor's Office has gone ahead and commissioned three outlandishly ambitious proposals from leading architectural firms for what to do with the area now occupied by Heathrow if it does end up moving.  All of them would see airport terminals replaced with a futuristic metropolis of hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses, but they're quite distinct in their specific visions of a ""Heathrow City."" Architectural firm Hawkins\Brown wants to create a city of custom, 3D-printed homes and make it a major traffic hub for delivery drones (like the kind Amazon aims to build). Hunger Games fans take note: Rick-Mather, another firm, wants to create a city with ten different districts that specialize in different industries, aligned along the former airport runways in a kind of Nouveau-Medieval style, with a center hub that acts as the primary meeting place. Finally, while all of the cities feature some environmentally friendly aspects, the one proposed by Maccreanor Lavington puts sustainability front and center, proposing that many existing airport buildings be repurposed and that contaminated grounds be turned into biofuel. Actually constructing a new airport and new city wouldn't be cheap: the new Thames Estuary airport on its own has estimated cost of over $170 billion (£100 billion), according to the Financial Times. But no matter what comes of Johnson's idea, the dreams of a future Heathrow City are fun to explore. — All images courtesy the London Mayor's Office, Maccreanor Lavington, Rick Mather, Hawkins\Brown.  The future city would be the site of a new UK airport designed specifically for delivery drones. (Hawkins/Brown) The city would also be a major port for a new series of ultra-efficient, safer dirigibles.  (Hawkins\Brown) Under the architecture firm's proposal, the future city would have 80,000 homes and offer 90,000 jobs. (Hawkins\Brown) Residents in the new city would also be able to order their own customized houses online and have the parts shipped via drone. (Hawkins\Brown) Under architecture firm Rick Mather's proposal, Heathrow's old runways would become the major arteries of a new city, carving it into 10 districts. (Rick Mather) Evoking 'the Hunger Games,' the plan would call for the center of Heathrow City to be the most dense urban area. (Rick Mather) Several of the spaces between the runways would be reserved for large public parks.  (Rick Mather) The plan calls for carving up the area now occupied by Heathrow into specialized sectors. One would focus on power generation, while another would host sports, festivals, and car races.  (Rick Mather) The city seen from an airplane.

So far, the smart money seems to be on Privateer Holdings: a Seattle-based private equity firm that secured a 30-year licensing deal to use Bob Marley's name and likeness to sell ""heirloom Jamaican cannabis strains"" and other Marley-branded merchandise. In a recent funding round, Privateer Holdings raised $75 million, bringing its total pot to $82 million and making it the best-funded player in the fledgling marijuana industry. Bob Marley's postmortem earnings were $20 million in 2014 Privateer's success is thanks at least in part to its licensing deal with Marley's family. The firm's Marley Natural brand launched last year and aims to start selling its products worldwide by the end of 2015. Leveraging Marley's fame is a bit of a no-brainer for the industry. Not only do people rightly associate Marley with marijuana use, but the reggae icon's image has already been used to sell everything from coffee to clothes. In fact, Forbes estimates that Marley was the fifth-highest paid dead celebrity last year, with postmortem earnings of around $20 million in 2014 alone.  However, Privateer has more in stock than just Marley Natural. Another of the firm's holdings is Leafly, an online directory that lists weed strains and shops as well as articles and discussions, and that went from 100,000 visits a month in 2012 to 5 million a month this year, according to TechCrunch. Another Privateer company is Tilray, which farms, packages, and sells pharmaceutical-grade cannabis in Canada. Currently, medical marijuana is legal in 23 states in the US, with recreational use legalized in four. With its array of brands, Privateer can target this growing market from multiple angles — observing trends and tastes on Leafly, and supplying the product via companies like Tilray. Privateer Holdings CEO and co-founder Brendan Kennedy told TechCrunch that the firm wants to create brands that ""inspire trust [and] create legitimacy."" ""a mainstream consumer product."" ""Our thesis was that this will be a mainstream consumer product used by mainstream Americans, and they will be looking for mainstream professional brands that don’t insult or offend them,"" said Kennedy.

However, after positive reviews across the board for the S6 and S6 Edge, some analysts are expecting the new devices to sell as many as 50 million units in 2015 alone. ""We expect the sales volume to hit the highest record ever among the Galaxy series,"" said Lee Sang-chul, Samsung's head of mobile marketing. Samsung says demand for the s6 Edge is outstripping supply Samsung also seems bullish about the prospects of the S6 Edge. The company's head of mobile, JK Shin, told press that demand for the Edge was outstripping supply, thanks to both increased orders from carriers and the difficulty of manufacturing the Edge's curved screen. Of course, not being able to keep up with demand does not necessarily mean that demand is exceptionally high — it says more about launch inventory than future sales — but even a relatively small number of extra sales for the S6 Edge would be good news for Samsung thanks to its higher price point (an extra $100). Although the S6 and S6 Edge go on sale today in the US, UK, Germany, and France, customers in other markets — especially in Asia and Africa — will have to wait at least a week to get their hands on one.

It’s designed in part so that people no longer have to go to a Sprint retail store or wait for a UPS or FedEx delivery, but it’s also a personal customer service experience that will walk you through setting up your new device. The new service, which is free, is primarily for Sprint customers who are due for an upgrade from an old device, though the company says it will also be used to lure in new customers. In either case, once a new device has been purchased, Sprint arranges delivery to wherever you specify (which apparently is not an exaggeration).

""You can tell us ‘6:45, and meet me at McDonald's.’"" Sprint is using a third-party partner to do the legwork, though the people who come to your house will appear to be from Sprint, right down to the vehicle they’re driving. Millar says the company is doing some hand-holding before the company’s representatives even show up. There’s a call ahead of time to do things like confirm scheduling, make sure passwords are stored somewhere, and help initiate a phone backup to a computer or cloud service, which can be time-intensive. Just like in Sprint’s stores, they’ll ferry over your data between different phone platforms, like going from iOS to Android or vice versa. Sprint believes its technicians will be in your home (or elsewhere) for about 45 minutes to one hour. Visits could run 45 minutes to an hour Along with setting up your phone, Sprint is using the visits as a chance to push its trade-in program, which buys the old devices in exchange for bill credit. The technicians will value your old device on the spot, something Sprint has long been doing in its stores. That’s as far as it goes, though: Millar insists that no other services will be pushed on customers during the Direct 2 You sessions. ""When we started brainstorming, this was a point that came up in the first hour, and the answer is no, this is not about upsell at all,"" Millar says.

It’s starting out in Kansas City, Missouri, before expanding to Miami and Chicago on April 20th, with other parts of the US to follow. As for whether this threatens Sprint’s in-store experience, where people might end up buying accessories or upgrading their services (which is a big part of why Sprint and Standard General are snapping up beleaguered RadioShack stores), Millar shrugs that off. ""Some customers love the in-store experience. They love that they get the help from a Sprint expert that knows what they’re doing,"" he says.

A poster teasing the phone shows Hitler giving the Nazi salute while wearing an armband marked with the Apple logo. Apple, explained Letv CEO Jia Yueting in an accompanying post on Weibo, is an ""arrogant regime"" that has embraced ""tyranny."" Jia quickly apologized for invoking Nazis to shill electronics, saying he meant only that ""open-ended technology ecosystems are more beneficial to consumers."" More beneficial than, say, Apple and Hitler, which respectively adopted policies requiring in-house vetting of mobile apps (in Apple’s case) and the systematic genocide of millions (in Hitler’s). As a brand disaster, Jia’s comments were unfortunate, but as content marketing they had their desired effect. Thousands of people around the world were introduced to fast-growing, loose-talking Letv, and anticipation for the company’s first smartphone shifted from nonexistent to ""let’s see how it compares to Hitler."" Brand disaster as content marketing At an event Monday evening in San Francisco, Letv (pronounced ""L-E-T-V"") introduced itself to the United States in the same awkward, lost-in-translation style it had used to bash Apple. A group of American and Chinese journalists gathered in a half-empty conference space in the Financial District, where an Letv-branded television delivered a stilted video transmission from Jia himself. ""Hello US,"" he said. ""Letv is coming.""   So what is Letv? Listening to Jia wasn’t much help; he described his $12 billion company as ""an open, vertically integrated ecosystem for how content is distributed and experienced."" So ignore that and instead think of Letv as a kind of Chinese YouTube that went public instead of selling to Google. Now imagine that YouTube had opened its own movie studio, and started manufacturing connected TVs so as to better market its video content. And then told you it was going to make an electric car and call it ""the sixth screen."" A name previously reserved for French roller discos And finally, just as you were wrapping your brain around that, imagine YouTube threw a party announcing its arrival in a large foreign market, though none of its products would be for sale there for many months to come. That’s Letv in a nutshell. Its new device is called ""Le Superphone,"" a name previously reserved for French roller discos of the late 1970s, and it’s going on sale in China today and America later this year. Mark Li, a Letv vice president, and JD Howard, a former Lenovo executive who is running Letv’s international expansion, were tasked with introducing Le Superphone to America. ""The smartphone industry is getting a little stale,"" Howard lamented. ""It’s a little same-old, same-old."" Ever since a certain never-mentioned smartphone re-fashioned the industry in its image, possibly using a combination of arrogance and tyranny, the world had delivered only incremental improvements. Enter Letv. With 400 million monthly users of its streaming-video service, the company has ""the experience, the creativity, and the ambition to disrupt in this space,"" executives told us. I girded myself for the knowledge bombs about to drop. ""We’re not trying to be like everybody else here,"" Howard said. A slide behind him flashed a single word: Innovation. The innovations mentioned on stage numbered three: a different kind of USB connector, a display with enhanced colors, and improved sound reproduction. They sounded like the sort of incremental improvements that Letv had just spent 20 minutes complaining about, but there were no phones to be seen, so I reserved my judgment for a while. I’m not a tyrant. ""We're not trying to be like everybody else."" A Q&A followed, and I asked Li if he cared to elaborate on the similarities between Apple and Hitler. He declined, referring me instead to Jia’s previous apology. Instead, Li talked about opening a new office in Silicon Valley, from which Letv will seek content deals with American companies. A short while later, we moved to a second room to see Le Superphone — which I mentally pronounce in a cartoon Parisian accent — in action.   When a Letv employee puts it in my hand, I first think it’s an HTC One: similar polished aluminum finish, similar gray borders on the rear, similar placement of camera and fingerprint sensor. Le Superphone has similar rounded edges and a large screen, though weirdly no one can tell me the exact size other than to say there will be three choices. (The displays all appear to be hovering within a fingernail or two of 5.5 inches.) In keeping with fashion, the phone has a thin bezel, though not so thin I couldn't rest a thumb on the home button. Le spec sheet of Le Superphone largely meets your expectations for a flagship Android phone these days: it runs on a Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 chip, has a high-resolution display, and offers a 21-megapixel camera. It’s billed as the first Android phone to use a reversible USB Type-C port for charging and data transfer, and includes a custom sound chip to offer enhanced audio. (We didn’t get to try it.) An Instagram filter for your operating system And yet the whole thing feels, as they say over at Letv, a little same-old, same-old. At the hands-on area, I asked Howard to explain it to me. Where’s all that innovation? He proceeded to show me a Superphone feature that lets you change the default color settings of your phone to make them more or less saturated — like applying an Instagram filter to the entire operating system. I had never given any thought to the color settings of my phone, and never will again, but if you’ve ever looked at your iPhone and wished you could make everything look vaguely red, you may want to book travel to Beijing. I pressed Howard on Letv’s US ambitions, and how its core asset — millions of hours of Chinese-language video — would be of any use to it here. The United States has an estimated 2.9 million Chinese speakers, the company says; Apple sells eight times as many iPhones in a month. Howard tells me that Letv’s core skill lies in building up libraries of content and finding lucrative ways to distribute them; eventually, he says, Letv could offer Superphones localized to many different ethnicities, all tied to language-specific content libraries. The since-deleted teaser poster for tonight’s event showed us two worlds: one that embodied ""arrogance [and] tyranny"" (Apple, supposedly) and another that represented crowdsourcing and ""freedom."" But we never saw any crowdsourcing tonight, and Le Superphone doesn’t strike any obvious blows for freedom beyond its wackadoodle color settings. Arrogance, though — there was plenty of that on display. And it wasn’t Apple's.",0.561440459557542,0.43855954044245804,0.8651267408558296,1119,5.0974084003574625,634,6.3690851735015777,0,4,"Business, Mobile, Tech, Report"

The company told creators of popular channels today that the offering, which does not yet have a name, is coming soon. It will offer ad-free videos as well as the ability to store videos offline on their mobile devices, for a price expected to be around $10 a month. It will also let creators put their videos behind a paywall so that only subscribers to the premium version can view them, sources said. (Bloomberg published a letter sent to creators today.) The offering may also include lower-priced subscriptions for specific categories, such as music and children's programming. (YouTube Music Key, which serves as a model for the all-access subscription, has been in invite-only beta since November. At the time, Google said Music Key would cost $7.99 a month when it comes out of beta.) For creators, YouTube's carrot comes with a stick The subscription offers big channels a new way to make money. While YouTube will still take roughly 45 percent of all advertising revenue generated by the channel, they're also offering partners a cut of the subscription money. Subscription revenues will be pooled, with partners receiving 55 percent of the total. Individual partners' cuts will be apportioned based on how much time their viewers spend watching their channels, though, so even medium-sized channels may not earn meaningful revenue from the subscription. And YouTube's carrot comes with a stick — creators are required to participate in the subscription offering, or every video on their channels will be set to private, sources said. The move will likely upset some creators, who may object to aspects of the program. ""While we can't comment on ongoing discussions, giving fans more choice to enjoy the content they love and creators more opportunity to earn revenue are always amongst our top priorities,"" a YouTube spokeswoman said in an email. YouTube's move comes amid increasing competition in the world of online video, particularly premium video. Vessel, created by the team behind Hulu, launched last month with a business model designed to address the gripes of YouTube creators, who have long complained about the relatively few ways they can make money on the platform. Vessel also offers creators a cut of subscription revenues, along with a higher percentage of ad revenue. The letter sent to creators is below.

In the otherwise boring world of processing and paying claims, this field work can actually be quite dangerous. Which is why the insurance giant AIG announced today it had been granted an exemption by the FAA to start using drones in place of humans on these kinds of risky jobs. That follows similar exemptions for State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. and United Services Automobile Association. ""UAVs can help accelerate surveys of disaster areas with high-resolution images for faster claims handling, risk assessment, and payments. They can also quickly and safely reach areas that could be dangerous or inaccessible for manual inspection, and they provide richer information about properties, structures, and claim events,"" the company wrote in a press release. ""The exemption also permits AIG to implement a robust research and development program to explore new and innovative ways to employ UAVs in support of the needs of its customers."" ""I’ve never been as excited about the insurance industry as I am now."" AIG is likely just the first of many in the insurance industry to pursue this new approach to aerial imaging. ""I’ve never been as excited about the insurance industry as I am now,"" said Andrew Maximow, director of client services at the drone maker 3D Robotics. Over the last few months his company has gotten several exemptions, including one to work on supplementing BNSF railroad track inspectors with drones. 3D Robotics has also received enormous interest from the insurance industry. ""This definitely was a watershed moment for us."" For now the FAA only allows drones to be flown for commercial purposes when they are controlled by a human pilot and stay within that person's line of sight. To fully realize their potential, these flying robots would need to be allowed to operate autonomously and over long distances. Testing for that kind of drone work is happening in Europe and Canada, which is why Amazon has been researching its delivery drones abroad and complaining loudly to the FAA. But the recent flood of exemptions for corporations like AIG and BSNF, as well as the release of draft rules for the entire industry, show the FAA is accelerating its pace.

Lee has played villains from Scaramanga to Saruman Lee first came to prominence playing Count Dracula in a string of films in the '50s and '60s for cult UK studio Hammer Horror. His 6-foot-5-inch-tall frame and menacing air allowed him to take up villainous roles in some of the movie world's biggest franchises in the following years. Lee played Bond villain Francisco Scaramanga in The Man with the Golden Gun, Sith lord Count Dooku in two Star Wars prequels, and turncoat wizard Saruman in The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit. Lee considered his best film, however, to be the 1973 classic The Wicker Man, where he played the aristocratic leader of a pagan cult, Lord Summerisle.   Lee may be best remembered for his film work, but he also led a strikingly full life away from the camera. Before embarking on his film career, he volunteered in the Royal Air Force in 1940 before working as an intelligence officer in Egypt, Libya, and Malta. After World War II ended he also spent some months helping to hunt down Nazi war criminals, but refused to comment on his wartime activity. ""I was attached to the SAS from time to time but we are forbidden —former, present, or future — to discuss any specific operations,"" said Lee. ""Let’s just say I was in Special Forces and leave it at that. People can read into that what they like."" Lee recorded two symphonic heavy metal albums about King Charlemagne Lee was also a prolific musician and recorded a number of records including two symphonic heavy metal albums telling the life story of the First Holy Roman Emperor, King Charlemagne (Lee claimed to be a descendant of Charlemagne on his mother's side) as well as a pair of metal Christmas albums. He received the Spirit of Metal award in 2010, but to get a clearer idea of exactly how metal Lee was, just listen to him singing about how he ""shed the blood of the Saxon men."" He continued acting right up to his hospitalization and said that ""making films has never just been a job to me, it is my life."" Before his death, he was reportedly signed up to appear in a drama set before 9/11 alongside Uma Thurman, commenting in his BAFTA fellowship acceptance speech: ""I hate being idle.

After a lengthy period of public comments, the commission passed a new set of rules that appear to stand on stronger legal backing. The rules passed in late February, but they're only now going into effect.  The internet isn't about to change, the FCC just has more power to stop problems Though the rules are now active, there aren't about to be major changes to the internet. In fact, these rules are largely meant to preserve the status quo. They prevent internet providers from blocking access to apps and websites, from throttling traffic speeds, and from selling fast lanes. The rules apply to mobile internet and traditional wired connections, and they also reclassify internet providers' legal standing in a way that will give the FCC more authority to regulate them. In short, if the commission thinks that an internet provider is unreasonably interfering with your ability to access or choose what you do online, it can now stop them. At least, the commission has the power to stop them for now. To absolutely no one's surprise, internet providers are once again bringing the rules to court in an attempt to overturn them. Legal proceedings haven't progressed much so far, but a federal court did decline a request yesterday that could have temporarily halted the rules. The Washington Post reports that oral arguments are expected to begin around the turn of the year. It's not clear how long it'll take before the commission's latest attempt at net neutrality is either fully overturned or found to be on solid ground — there's a lot to discuss — but for now the rules are here and helping to keep the internet open. ""This is huge victory for Internet consumers and innovators! Starting Friday, there will be a referee on the field to keep the Internet fast, fair, & open. Blocking, throttling, pay-for-priority fast lanes and other efforts to come between consumers and the Internet are now things of the past.""

The 373-page document titled ""A Question of Trust"" defends the controversial bulk collection of online data, but argues that the power to authorize individual surveillance warrants should be transferred from politicians to judges. ""The current law is fragmented, obscure, under constant challenge and variable in the protections that it affords the innocent,"" said David Anderson, the lead author of the report. ""It is time for a clean slate."" The report criticizes the so-called Snoopers Charter Moving the powering to authorize individual warrants would, in theory, make it more difficult for intelligence agencies to carry out intrusive surveillance, but there's no guarantee that politicians will heed the report's recommendations. It also suggests that plans to revive the so-called Snoopers Charter — a controversial bill requiring ISPs to maintain records of users' internet history and messaging metadata for up to a year — should be shelved until there is actual evidence the law is needed. This is likely to irk the current Conservative government, which has been eager to push forward new surveillance laws. The report itself was commissioned by prime minister David Cameron last year as a direct response to the Edward Snowden revelations. Similar inquiries have been carried out in America, although while the US government has chosen to clamp down on mass surveillance, the UK's approach is to instead call for new safeguards. However, Anderson's central recommendation is that whatever new laws are introduced should be comprehensible to the public. ""Obscure laws,"" said Anderson at a press conference, ""corrode democracy itself.""",0.5410774019780039,0.4589225980219961,0.7887968037647224,285,5.5754385964912281,186,6.424731182795699,0,0,"Policy & Law, US & World"

For now at least, it remains an Apple exclusive, only available for stream on Apple Music and digitally through iTunes.

Disney has become a monolithic presence in the worlds of films, games, music, comics, theater, resorts, travel, and conventions, providing a reporting workload for an entire website. I'm the only full-time editor on the Disney beat, but we intend to expand the section alongside the company, matching its moves with a comparable scale and quality of reporting. I promise to provide hard news and vital scoops. Investigating the most powerful entertainment studio on the planet won't be easy, but I vow to embody the same life-risking attitude of the world's bravest reporters. This won't just be another fan site farming traffic off trailers, leaked set photos, and baseless rumors. What a year! Last December, I struck out on my own to bring serious Disney reporting to The Verge on a daily basis. While the countless trailers, set photos, and rumors didn't leave me much time for reporting, I am proud to say The Verge's Disney coverage is the fastest-growing portion of both this site and all of Vox Media. Your appetite for Star Wars, Marvel, Indiana Jones, and Frozen 2 news has allowed me to expand at a rate I couldn't have imagined. While I'm proud of our five-person team — two reporters, two video producers, and myself — we have plans to expand even further. With an eye to the future, we're currently looking to fill the following roles:   When you see Guardians of the Galaxy: Vol. 2 be sure to stay in the theater at least 10 minutes after the staff politely asks you to leave. The post-post-post credits sequence is the biggest clue yet about the future of the Disney metaverse. You already know the film's plot from the trailer: Star-Lord saves the galaxy, proposes to Kitty Pride, and kindles a lifelong friendship with Howard the Duck; the space adventurer charts a vacation for a tropical planet where music is limited to covers of 1970s rock bands. Roll credits. But in this bonus scene, Star-Lord crash lands on a frozen planet. Taking cover inside a cave, the young man finds something that will change his life, his destiny, and the Marvel canon forever: a lightsaber. Odds were on Joss Whedon at the 2018 Academy Awards. The writer and director, nominated for an adaptation of Richard III set inside the offices of a Silicon Valley social media app, appeared to have the honor in the bag. But Academy members split the Best Picture vote between Whedon's critical darling and Bushwhacked, Kathryn Bigelow's dramatization of the collapse of Jeb Bush's 2016 run for president, allowing Toy Story 4 to score the biggest Best Picture upset since Crash. This is a huge win for director John Lasseter, who dedicated his emotional speech to his his wife and children. The speech was only slightly marred by an offhand and perplexing comment criticizing the US government for threatening to tax Disney's plan to one day build a resort on the Moon. The loss is the first setback in some time for Whedon, who had carte blanche following his success with Marvel films. Even without the gold statue, Richard III has established the director as something of a Hollywood miracle worker who can turn practically anything into a hit. Sources at major studios agree that Whedon can do whatever he'd like, so long as it's not another Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog. Did you camp in line to see The Force Awakens? Did you write a master's thesis on gender and sexuality in Frozen? Are you convinced, despite what Disney has said, that Guardians of the Galaxy and Star Wars are actually set in the same universe? And do you have five or more years of professional writing experience at a major online media outlet? If so, we'd love for you to apply for one of the following jobs:   Audiences are more likely to watch reality shows in which all contestants wear superhero costumes than they are to watch similar reality shows in which superhero costumes are not prominently featured, according to a report from The Paley Center for Media. That superhero costumes weren't a part of reality television a mere three years ago will be hard for some streaming viewers to believe. The Paley Center believes that directives from both Netflix and Amazon asking participants in their new catalog of reality shows to wear superhero outfits — colorful capes and spandex that represent their character strengths and flaws — has helped the streaming companies increase viewership without the heavy budgets of their awards-friendly programs. An analytical report from Wedbush Securities shows the trend is clear and replicable. Data indicates that simply taking franchises like Survivor and The Bachelor, and adding superhero costumes to the wardrobe and a pun to the title, produces a show with almost twice the viewership as the original. Netflix's NeXt-Men, a dating show produced by Marvel in which men and women choose from a bus full of suitors in superhero suits, is the front-runner for this year's Primetime Emmy for Outstanding Reality Television Program. Universal celebrated the record-breaking $570 million international opening weekend of Jurassic World 2: The Lost Jurassic World by confirming the leak of its decade-long production slate. The list of films in development at the studio was leaked by an internet activism group demanding the production company lower the prices of in-app purchases in their Minions mobile game — currently the most popular game on Earth, with over 2 million active players a day. The films include the mysteriously named Jurassic Universe, Mini Minion, a series of superhero movies built around Universal's classic monster properties, F9st and Furi9us, and four spinoff films planned for the next eight years that will follow the solo adventures of Dominic Toretto, Letty, Hobbs, and the ghost of Han. Should Disney be scared? With DC Comics on the ropes, the closest competitor is now Universal, whose Fast & Furious films, some analysts believe, could be the superhero flicks of a new generation. If Disney's worried, they aren't letting anyone know it. On Twitter, the official Disney account responded to the news with a puckish, ""We'll be first in line when Dom Torretto faces a T-Rex #congrats #stillnumber1."" Update: A press release confirmed the social media specialist operating Disney's Twitter handle has been let go. A year to the day after Jurassic World 2: The Lost Jurassic World destroyed box office records with a $570 million international opening weekend, Avengers: Infinity War - Part 2 opens with an astounding $620 million. Bloomberg reports that the studio, sponsors, and partners spent over $500 million on cross-marketing promotions. The film is projected to gross $1 billion dollars by the end of its first week in theaters. Update July 13th, 2019, 12:05PM: Unfortunately, the teaser has been pulled by Disney. For fans that missed the three-minute-long teaser trailer, the words ""Indiana,"" ""Jones,"" ""Chris,"" ""Pratt,"" and ""Coming"" — as well as the number 2020 — gradually fade in and out as a plane charts its way across a 1930s world map. And then, for the briefest second, we see Chris Pratt in full Indiana Jones gear. He's in a tomb, and soak sweats through his shirt. From the walls, spiders begin to pour into the room, surrounding the hero. He looks directly into the camera, and he says, ""Why did it have to be spiders?!"" This is a significant departure for the character, who formerly was afraid of snakes. For months now, Robert Downey Jr. and Disney have been unable to come to an agreement about the actor's involvement in Phase 4 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Rumors abounded of Downey Jr.'s reported $50-million-per-film price tag and demand that he spend no more than 30 days on set per film. But the two parties have managed to strike a last-minute arrangement, and it will involve the sort of technological wizardry Tony Stark is known for. Robert Downey Jr. has sold his image, voice, and ""soul"" rights to be used in perpetuity and in all configurations for a lump sum of $1 billion. While that's certainly more than the estimated $250 million the actor would have made from initial plans for Phase 4, the contract will allow Disney to make movies starring the actor with as much or as little screen time as they wish for Phase 4 through Year 4000, if they so choose. Under the agreement, Downey Jr. will no longer act in films, and will instead spend a few days a month for the next 10 years collaborating with a top team at Industrial Light and Magic, working to create an ever-more-lifelike digital replication of the celebrity. The past five years haven't gone as hoped for DC Comics, whose flood of grimy, brooding superhero and supervillain films — designed to replicate Marvel's hot streak — failed to become record-breaking summer blockbusters. But while audiences failed to connect with live-action depictions of the comic book characters, 2017's The Lego Batman movie struck box office gold, and pointed the way for the future of Warner Bros. and DC Comics. Today, DC Comics announces its plan to quadruple down on the Lego and superhero mash-up strategy with the announcements of The Lego Superman Movie (2020), The Lego Joker Movie (also 2020), The Lego Flash Movie (2021), and The Lego Green Lantern Movie (2022). While the studio wouldn't confirm the rumors of The Lego Justice League Movie, it's widely believed that the five Lego superhero films are leading to an Avengers-like team flick. Perhaps that one will star a female Lego lead. At Marvel Media Day, the superhero peddler announced its slate of blockbuster films for Phase 4 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.   If you like Disney and Marvel movies, get your Venmo chip ready for a new subscription streaming service: Disneywhere. The platform, launching today, is now the only streaming service for all Disney, Pixar, Marvel, The Muppets, ESPN Films, and ABC television programs. Films and shows formerly available on competitor services disappeared this morning. In a boilerplate email, a Netflix representative stated that Disney's contract had been set for renewal, and negotiations were going well before ""Disney's decision makers stopped returning our phone calls."" Disneywhere launches with an exclusive new children's cartoon The Littlest Jedis of the Galaxy, a mash-up of the Star Wars and Guardians of the Galaxy universes, picking up where the post-credits sequence of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 left off. The story follows Star-Lord and his comrades Groot, Rocket, Howard the Duck, Drax, and Gamora, who — following a cosmic time rip triggered by Howard the Duck's five-alarm bean burrito farts — are now infants training to become jedis. Thunderbolts leaves theaters this weekend, marking the deepest drop yet in the worldwide gross of Marvel films. This one graph says it all about the Marvel Cinematic Universe's beleaguered Phase 3.   If you had asked me in 2015 how DC would surpass Marvel at the box office, I would never have guessed a deluge of Lego films. And yet, here we are with The Lego Green Lantern earning $1.8 billion worldwide, and DC and Warner Bros. announcing that the upcoming The Lego Justice League Movie will be split into three films. The Lego Justice League Movie: Brick by Brick will release in the summer of 2023, The Lego Justice League Movie: Little Miss Kryptonite will arrive the following summer of 2024, and The Lego Justice League Movie: Mixed Up with Mxyzptlk will hit the same year just in time for the holidays. ""We believe there's no limit to the American — and international — audience's hunger for Lego superhero movies,"" said Warner Bros.' new director of superhero intellectual property Jax Biffman. A hack of Sony's servers, the third this month, revealed that the company would be acquired by Disney moments before the company was acquired by Disney. With hacks happening on an almost weekly basis at Sony, most negotiations have been moved to paper-based technologies, but discussions of the plan appeared briefly in an email from Sony Pictures president Jake Thornbush sent to Disney VP of development Lindsay Grahamburger titled, ""Re: Jax Biffman is a total butthole."" The personal email is four paragraphs of gossip about the Warner Bros. executive, who Grahamburger claims drunkenly shat himself at last year's Comic-Con when a fan dressed as Groot from Guardians of the Galaxy jumped out from behind a corner. ""My name is Groot?"" wrote Thornbush. ""More like 'His name is poop. Hahahaha.'"" In a postscript, Thornbush said he looks forward to seeing Grahamburger at the ""big acosition [sic] branstorm [sic]."" With Marvel in a tailspin after the dismal box office return of the Phase 3 films, Marvel plans to reunite all its heroes under the same banner for a reboot of its Cinematic Universe. Today, Disney announced it has acquired 20th Century Fox, as well as the latter studio's legacy contracts for the film rights to X-Men, Fantastic Four, and a handful of other Marvel characters. For nearly a decade, Marvel and Fox have tried to collaborate on films, but anonymous insiders close to Marvel say the studio no longer wants to compromise on its vision for Wolverine, Professor X, and the countless other mutants in dire need of cinematic representation. ""I mean this goes back to Avengers: Age of Ultron,"" said the source, who had experience working with both Fox and Marvel. ""Marvel wasn't pleased to rewrite the backstory of Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch. They think of their characters like they're their own children. They probably think about them more than they think about their actual children, really."" For the first time in 16 years, Marvel will not be releasing a film during a calendar year. At this year's Comic-Con, Marvel reps said the studio is taking this time to create the best Marvel movies yet. At D23 2025, Marvel announced its upcoming slate for the reboot of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. According to Disney's new director of superhero media, Rex Biffman, brother of Warner Bros.' new director of superhero intellectual property Jax Biffman, Phase A is a pared-down crop of stories that returns Marvel films to what fans loved the most about them: normal people with extraordinary powers helping a world that isn't sure whether to idolize or destroy them. Rex Biffman also announced that Disney and Microsoft would be collaborating on Minecraft adaptations of Marvel's mythology throughout Phase A.   Following the announcement, Biffman answered questions from fans. When asked if Rex's relationship with brother Jax was a conflict of interested, Rex revealed that he hadn't spoken to his brother since 2015, when an argument over Zack Snyder's capability as a director led to a fistfight between the then college-aged siblings. ""It's been said once and I'll say it again,"" said Rex. ""Jax Biffman is a total butthole."" Story developing... Elon Musk is having a bad day on Planet Earth, with work indefinitely stalled on his $4 billion and counting Hyperloop project. But in space, the inventor and entrepreneur doesn't have to worry about the State of California's bureaucracy. After five years of shuttling Space X-branded construction ‘bots to the surface of the gaseous Red Planet, Musk confirmed that the machines have begun work on a self-sustaining server farm on the otherwise uninhabited celestial body. Musk foresees the grand opening of a fully operational First Bank of Mars to occur within the next five years. Governments across the world have taken Musk to court over his plan, though Musk believes his extraterrestrial bank is free of oversight from Earth's taxation. Musk intends for the First Bank of Mars to begin where PayPal ends, working in tandem with Bitcoin to create a new libertarian method of using and saving currency. While no other businesses have confirmed involvement with the First Bank of Mars, sources close to Musk claim Exxon, Wal-Mart, and Disney plan to be the service's first clients. Rumors about Disney's interest in Mars have heated up with plans to build a resort on the Moon squashed by new US tax legislation that recognizes the lunar surface as a commonwealth. Under the No Propagation of Media Act of 2024, this video has been removed at the request of Roc Nation. If you'd like to hear the song, it is available exclusively to subscribers of the Tidal channel in Apple Music and on the limited vinyl release of the Mulan 2: Make a Woman Out of You Official Soundtrack. It pains me to say that hundreds of Disney stories — and other Verge stories — were lost in our site-wide migration to Facebook. (Return to top) Marvel is back! Today, Marvel announced that the biggest reality star on the planet, North West, will play her first fictional role as Ms. Marvel for the launch of Phase B of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Phase A of the Marvel Cinematic Universe started strong with the rebooted Iron Man, featuring a wholly computer-animated version of Robert Downey Jr. that incorporated the blonde tresses the venerable actor sported in 2024. Disney's purchase of Downey Jr.'s life rights looks especially wise in hindsight, with the reclusive mega-star unseen by the public since a brief appearance at the 2024 Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards. Box offices only improved from there with The Minecraft Captain America Movie destroying box office records with a $2 billion worldwide opening. The Minecraft Captain America Movie was the first Marvel film to open both at traditional theaters and virtual reality theaters within the Oculus platform. North West, who rose to fame in her own right after appearing on her mother Kim Kardashian-West and father Kanye West's groundbreaking reality series, Westing Up with the Kimyes, and starring in her own weekly program, North by North West, in which the 14-year-old chronicled her Netflix television superhero adaptation / reboot of the forgotten 1990s Elijah Wood vehicle, North. Like so many reality stars before her, West's reality career has benefited from her wearing a superhero costume at all times. Following the unprecedented success of the Elon Musk-helmed First Bank of Mars, Disney quietly and quickly began work on its own Martian operation: Disney Globe. The theme park, which the company announced today is under construction by robots already on the planet's surface, some contracted from Space X, will cater to retirees who want to spend their final years immersed in the Disney experience — without losing their savings to taxes. ""There's no tax on Disney Globe,"" said Lacey Burphouser, director of Disney Globe's Residential Operations. ""Guests only have to pay Disney's annual fee, which will be based off their net worth and annual income."" Residents will have the option to live inside condos built within the scenery of their favorite attractions, watching park visitors experiencing the resort's rides through one-way windows. Burphouser hopes that these touches, unavailable anywhere on Earth, will inspire clients to take the six-month trip away from their home planet. ""I just hope the humans like the planet half as much as the robots do,"" said Burphouser, in reference to the newly designed construction bots designed to look like real-world versions of Mickey Mouse and other iconic Disney characters. Chris Pratt's coterie of characters has reliably earned Disney millions for over 15 years, but Disney has an unprecedented plan to build a new revenue stream out of Pratt himself. Ten years after Disney purchased the image, voice, and ""soul"" rights from then-star, now-Harrison-Ford-esque-recluse Robert Downey Jr. for a cool $1 billion, the studio has announced the acquisition of the same rights from Chris Pratt for $1.5 billion. Pratt, whose image in The Littlest Jedis of the Galaxy, is one of Disney's most valuable commodities as the lead in the Guardians of the Galaxy television programs and the rebooted Indiana Jones and Star Wars franchises. To celebrate the acquisition, Disney has announced Apple AR owners will have the ability to be perceived as their favorite Chris Pratt characters by other Apple AR owners using a novel app that wraps their body in a head-to-toe, lifelike animation. While Pratt could not be reached for comment, his representatives say the actor doesn't believe the acquisition will discourage him from taking real life roles, likely a reaction to Robert Downey Jr.'s recent behavior. Downey Jr. was last spotted by paparazzi in 2028, boiling his boots in the backwoods of Claire Danes' Big Sur property. Danes, reportedly, had no idea that the actor had been there for the last 13 months prior. ""Boot stew,"" Downey Jr. is reported to have said, before retreating into his RV and taking off for parts unknown. Today, DC Comics announces its plan of quadrupling down on the reboot strategy with the announcements of Superman (2031), Wonder Woman (2032), The Flash (2033), and Green Lantern (2034). While the studio wouldn't confirm the rumors of a Justice League reboot, it's widely believed that the five rebooted superhero films are leading to an Avengers-like team flick. The strategy will sound familiar to critics of Warner Bros. and DC Comics Lego strategy, which reversed the company's fortunes in the early 2020s. Warner Bros. also announced that the company was in negotiations to acquire the image, voice, and ""soul"" rights of Christian Bale. Spotted by a New York Post reporter at Momofuku Bar and Grill, the actor hinted that the rumor might be true. ""Now is the time to seize the day,"" said Bale. ""Stare down the odds, and seize the day."" Disney continues to bring the biggest media companies and their precious properties under its mouse-eared umbrella. Today, the company acquired mass media giant Comcast. While the company's cable and internet operations have become an obsolete relic reserved for older clientele — thanks to the now almost universal membership to Google's free 36Gbps internet — the properties at NBCUniversal are the few remaining non-Disney films competing for attention in traditional and virtual theaters. ""This is a game changer,"" said Dolph Hornbeagle, VP of theatrical experiences at Oculus. Hornbeagle believes that the acquisition will make Disney the ""mythmakers of our time."" The Fast & Furious franchise, which has released an average of three films a year, was the best hope for a studio to dethrone Disney's success with Marvel Phase A and the on-going Star Wars reboot project. ""Never before in history,"" continued Hornbeagle, ""has one entity controlled the majority of fictional entertainment. We at Oculus let you escape reality, but Disney, they literally author reality. History won't be written by the winners, it'll be written by the holder of the most bankable IPs."" Disney representatives said fans can expect to hear more at D23 about plans to incorporate the Fast & Furious, Final Destination, and Jurassic Park franchises into Disney canon. It's hard to believe 15 years ago I became The Verge's first full-time senior editor devoted to Disney coverage. I am proud that we have stuck with our original plan: to provide our readers with more trailers, set photos, and rumors. As The Verge's VP of Disney content, I oversee 85 of the most talented editors, reporters, designers, and filmmakers on the Disney beat. I want to take this moment to thank them for their tireless, creative work. I also want to thank you. You've followed us from our early days on the homepage of The Verge dot com to our time within the Facebook ecosystem and onwards to the many platforms that we now call home. Whether it's our Facebook, Snapchat, Blingo, Porkpot, Tencent, or Alibaba Babosphere, we're blessed to engage with you every minute of every day. Look at this photo of students at a Harvard lecture on advanced intellectual property law. Can you spot which one wearing a Chris Pratt AR skin is Blue Ivy? Neither can the students. Ivy's publicist said that the former child star, who abandoned her music career to pursue a doctorate in film business — making her the youngest doctorate in the history of the program — is thankful for the Chris Pratt AR skin and the anonymity it provides. ""When Blue Ivy wears her Pratt skin,"" said publicist Yennifer Sondheim, ""she's looks just like everyone else in their Pratt skins. A Pratt in a sea of Pratts."" Perhaps Chris Pratt would like a Blue Ivy skin. The actor hasn't been seen (at least that we know of!) since moving into a remote compound outside of Des Moines, Iowa. Ms. Marvel, formerly known as North West, has thrown her support behind presidential candidate Chelsea Clinton. The former North West, who appeared as Ms. Marvel in Marvel's film adaptation of the titular comic series, has taken on the Ms. Marvel identity permanently, and spends her time and fortune fighting crime on the streets of Los Angeles. While Marvel hoped to prevent Ms. Marvel from embodying the identity of a character they own, the company lost the battle of public opinion. Ms. Marvel, who can be regularly seen driving a tank through the streets of West Hollywood and Los Feliz, is credited with the record-low crime in some of Los Angeles' wealthiest neighborhoods. Senator Clinton said she is ""honored to have the support of one of our nation's fiercest heroes."" Leonardo DiCaprio's Oscar drought is over at long last. The actor-cum-director took home Oscar gold last night for his live-action adaptation of The Littlest Jedis of the Galaxy, starring the computer-animated reproduction of Chris Pratt, the voice of Adam Sandler as a young Howard the Duck, a robotic recreation of Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker, and Ms. Marvel née North West as Ms. Marvel. ""I'm just happy I finally got to use that, 'He's the king of the world,' line,"" said the artificial intelligence replication of former Academy Awards writer Bruce Vilanch, whose death three years ago remains under investigation. Sources close to the Los Angeles Police Department say officials believe Vilanch was murdered by a Catskill comedian that had attempted to take the writer to court over allegedly stolen jokes. ""It's just such a sad story,"" said the source, ""but those jokes killed."" An earthquake has consumed much of central Los Angeles. It's unclear at this time how the natural disaster will affect the shooting schedule of Disney's 2035-2036 slate. Developing... Fans feared Disney would be crippled by the devastation of the LA Earthquake, but newly installed Disney CEO Rex Biffman opened D23 2035 with news that the company had, over the past decade, secretly backlogged over a half-dozen films that merge the full Disney catalog as a failsafe in case of a cataclysmic event. The films, Biffman hopes, will keep viewers entertained and the company financially stable while it begins work on a collaboration with the State of California that he calls, ""New Los Angeles."" The schedule for Phase X is below:   Disney has announced the Omni Awards, a ceremony designed to both celebrate and promote its progress on ""the city of the future."" According to a source close to Disney, the Omni Awards are meant to replace D23, Comic-Con, and the Academy Awards, all of which — insiders agree — have been rendered largely obsolete. A hybrid of fan conventions, press announcements, and awards ceremonies, the Omnis will span two weeks of events in various theaters and lecture halls within New Los Angeles. The rise of New Los Angeles, the nation's first ""privately held city,"" has felt, for many local residents, like a miracle. After the historically severe earthquake sunk central Los Angeles into a pit 200 feet beneath the city, Disney has worked tirelessly to revitalize the area. Unable to fund such a sizable relief effort, the State of California exchanged 23.5 square miles of land in the heart of Los Angeles for an undisclosed stake in Disney and an agreement that will see any standing governor as a member of the company's advisory board. Nobody, except for maybe Disney's senior most executives, could have imagined the speed and efficiency with which the company would rebuild downtown Los Angeles. Thanks in large part to lessons learned from the terraforming and construction work on Disney Globe, the studio-cum-citystate was able to program construction robots to create an artificial bedrock structure resistant to future earthquakes, with five new self-sustaining residential skyscrapers and a world-class production studio, within 19 months. Millions of the area's former residents have chosen to stay in the area, commuting via a high-speed elevator to and from the surface of what residents now like to call ""Old Los Angeles."" ""I love Old Los Angeles,"" said Tom Connors, a resident of one of the new condominiums and a developer on the anticipated Mark Hamill AR skin. ""But in New Los Angeles, the police are dressed like the Avengers. And the guy who drives the bus thinks he's Mickey Mouse. Now this is my kind of country!"" After months of silence, Chris Pratt has released a video statement confirming he is alive and that he plans to release a cookbook co-authored by Robert Downey Jr. by the end of the year. Hive-mind media services have been aflutter in recent months with the Pratt Is Dead movement gaining steam. Dead Pratt Truthers have long proclaimed that the actor died when his space shuttle, traveling to Disney Globe, crash-landed onto the gaseous red planet of Mars. The Truthers have believed that their theory was confirmed by the post-post-credits sequence of The Littlest Jedi of the Galaxy, in which Howard the Duck turns to the camera and says, ""This is not a joke, Chris Pratt died while taking a top secret trip to Mars."" Even with the announcement by Pratt, Truthers remain skeptical. ""This 'official statement' was clearly made by an imposter,"" said Tracey Börnswagger, a founding member of the official Pratt Is Dead Facebook Mob, which boasts over 10 million members. ""This could be anyone on the planet wearing a Chris Pratt AR skin."" How to Stew Boots, by Chris Pratt and Robert Downey Jr., will be available on all major book-to-pod streaming platforms this holiday season. Congress and President Clinton agree on one thing: America needs to be in the film business. The bill, dubbed, ""A Washingtonia to Save America,"" passed unanimously in both the House and the Senate, and was signed with great aplomb by President Clinton, allowing the government to fund a $20 billion entertainment studio. The plan comes two years after the government tried and failed to divide Disney under monopoly law. The measure is seen as a move of national security, with Disney receiving substantial funding from foreign investors, and paying fewer taxes than ever before by nesting income on Mars. ""Disney controls our economy, it controls our mythology, and it's gradually controlling our land,"" said Senator Todd Dingleback (I-TX). In the past year, Disney has acquired large plots of lands in New York City, Minneapolis, Seattle, and Topeka in the United States, and Buenos Aires, Dublin, Madrid, and Kyoto abroad by revitalizing areas destroyed in global warming incidents. ""Disney is a philanthropic organization that's gone to bat for humanity when government has failed it,"" said Disney CEO Rex Biffman. ""We are the heroes this nation wants, and the heroes it deserves."" Fans hope Biffman's comment hints at Disney's long-awaited acquisition of DC Comics. Creamzoids, the genetically engineered half-human, half-animal race of iconic Disney characters, have now been spotted breeding without a license in 19 other states and 4 other nations, claims a new report by the Dubai Post. The piece claims Disney has failed to prevent the new species from expanding outside of its Southern California laboratory. Disney officials claim Creamzoids were genetically engineered without reproductive organs, but the Dubai Post's report claims that Creamzoids have evolved rapidly, gaining the ability to reproduce, think at a superhuman-level, and possibly bend our understanding of reality with their advanced understanding of metaphysics. ""We've put on a good show of hating one another,"" said Jax Biffman, president of Warner Bros., in regards to the executive's assumed feud with brother and Disney CEO Rex Biffman. ""But really, we've been working tirelessly to bring Marvel and DC together for over a decade."" What some are calling corporate collusions, the Biffmans are calling brotherly love. And while the coupling of the two superhero powerhouses will make Disney the most powerful company in the world, fans are just happy to hear that Batman and Iron-Man will finally appear side by side. Disney confirms the film, Batman and Iron-Man in the Battle of New Los Angeles, will feature the computer-animated souls of Christian Bale and Robert Downey Jr. and will be the first film shot on-location in New Los Angeles using the 20,000 permanently installed 12K cameras built into the city's infrastructure. ""Seeing the replication of my two favorite actors in the comic book mash-up of our generation, it's just my childhood dream come true,"" said Scott Busby, vacationing in New Los Angeles from New Manhattan. Disney also announced the acquisition of multiple robotics and military engineering programs. Fans suspect the purchase is to improve the veracity of Disney's action-packed superhero catalog, though some critics claim the $30 billion round of acquisitions will leave Disney with the second largest standing army on the planet. For nearly 25 years, I've had the opportunity to provide you independent coverage of Star Wars, Marvel, and Indiana Jones. After devoting my life to bringing you the best trailers, set photos, and rumors, I fulfilled my all but forgotten dream of breaking through Disney's nearly impenetrable PR barrier and reporting on the grim activities that happen behind the glossy exterior. I thought ""The truth about Disney's Creamzoids and their gradual colonization of the United States,"" a feature that exposed Disney's collaboration with the US government to control the population with an artificial race called Creamzoids, would be the pinnacle of my career. I got my wish, though not as I expected. Today, Disney has acquired Vox Media along with the rights to mind, body, voice, and soul of all of its employees. With those rights, it has elected to feed all of us to the Creamzoids. To my co-workers, I give my apologies. To my family, I give my love. And to my readers, I give the following message prepared by my lawyer: Disney brings no harm unto the innocent. Let it be known that my punishment fits my crime. Do not mourn me, no matter what I say as my body is gnashed into pulp. Do not lose faith in the power of entertainment. Do not fear the Creamzoids.

Apple was set to reveal the box in June It was previously believed that Apple would lift the lid on its new TV hardware and software at June's WWDC event, but after the announcement failed to come, it was reported that the company was having difficulty hammering out deals with content providers. However, according to 9to5Mac, the delay was not the result of those stalled deals, but down to an an internal concern that pushing out a launch would compromise engineering resources required for iOS 9. The company reportedly decided to postpone the announcement until September to allow its engineers to polish iOS 9, building an operating system that would feel slick on a phone or tablet, but would also be optimized for the TV screen. Update: Read the Apple iOS 9 review. When it does arrive, 9to5Mac says the new Apple TV will boast a new slimmer design, revamped from the previous five-year-old model. It will also ship with a larger remote control that features tactile keys, in addition to support for touch- and gesture-based inputs. Files found inside the recent OS X 10.11 El Capitan developer betas suggest the remote will use both Bluetooth and infrared, and will have a form of audio technology built-in. 9to5Mac speculates that the audio could be used for private listening, for a microphone used to talk to Siri, or potentially to augment the sound of your TV — perhaps as the PlayStation 4's Dualshock 4 controller or the Wii's Wiimote do currently with small speakers producing complementary sounds. The set-top box will likely feature a dedicated App Store Apple TV's Siri integration will reportedly be paired with iOS 9's new Proactive function. Detailed at WWDC, Proactive can offer app and search suggestions based on context-sensitive information, such as time of day or location. Apple TV may use Proactive to let you search for shows, movies, or games across a range of apps and services, but 9to5Mac says Apple may wait until the hardware hosts more third-party apps before rolling it out. A full SDK for the creation of those apps will be available, and they'll likely be featured on a dedicated Apple TV App Store, as suggested in June. This could open the door to a range of apps and games to become available through the set-top box, but Apple is reportedly focusing on video apps for now, allowing creators to build channels and release them at their own pace. The new Apple TV set-top box will reportedly also come with general technological improvements, including more storage, a faster processor, and a revamped user interface, but as reported earlier this month, won't launch with Apple's planned internet TV service. Bloomberg says that the service, designed as a replacement for cable TV, won't see release until at least 2016. Apple is reportedly still at loggerheads with TV networks over pricing, but the company has also yet to invest enough in its network to maintain a good viewing experience for all customers, and the launch could be pushed back even further.",0.5056058834679886,0.4943941165320114,0.861322678491836,609,4.8275862068965516,321,6.0467289719626169,0,0,"Apple, Culture, Entertainment, Tech, Apple Rumors"

Right now, when Windows 10 users try to search for and download Google Chrome or Firefox from Microsoft's Edge browser, a dark bar appears at the top of the search results page saying that Microsoft recommends they use Edge, with a ""Learn Why"" button.

Genetic variations that can collectively increase a person’s risk of being diagnosed with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder can also be used to predict creativity, according to a new study published in Nature Neuroscience. The study's researchers claim that this is the strongest argument yet for shared roots linking psychosis and creativity. But the correlation found in this particular study isn't very strong, some researchers argue. And without a proper definition for creativity, arguing that such a link exists could do more harm than good. ""Schizophrenia and creativity share biology."" In the study, researchers at the biopharmaceutical company Decode Genetics analyzed medical and genetic data from 86,000 people in Iceland. They found that certain genetic variants, when combined, can be used to predict bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. Then, the researchers looked at these variants in over 1,000 people who work in ""creative occupations"" in Iceland — meaning people who belong to national societies of visual artists, dancers, musicians, writers, and actors. The analysis showed that people who belong to these artistic societies were more likely to carry variants that increase a person’s risk of developing either bipolar disorder or schizophrenia than people in other occupations. And when the researchers replicated the study using data from four studies carried out in Sweden and the Netherlands, they found similar results. These particular results couldn’t be explained by IQ, education, or how closely a study participant was related to a person who had been diagnosed with either mental illness, the researchers note. ""What we have shown is basically is that schizophrenia and creativity share biology,"" says neurologist Kari Stefánsson, CEO of Decode Genetics and a co-author of the study. The link is ""astonishingly weak."" But here’s the thing: the increase in risk can be kind of misleading. Together, the variants used the study only explain about 6 percent of schizophrenia and 1 percent of bipolar disorder, according to a graph in the study. And these same variants only explain about one-quarter of 1 percent of artistic ability. That means that the same genetic variants that explain ""about 1/20th of schizophrenia also explain about 1/250th of artists' ability,"" according to David Cutler, a population geneticist at Emory University who didn’t take part in the study. So, if you think of artistic ability as a 1-mile long road where someone with low artistic ability stands at one end and someone with high artist ability stands at the other, Cutler says, these particular variants collectively explain about 13 feet of that distance. ""Now 13 feet is not zero, but if I want to jump across a 1-mile distance, 13 feet doesn’t get me very far,"" Cutler says. ""There is a link, and it is astonishingly weak in the sense that most people would care about."" Roel Ophoff, a human geneticist at the University of California-Los Angeles, agrees. ""The reported correlations are tiny,"" he told Genetic Expert News Service. ""This means that the predictive power of the finding is limited."" There's another issue to consider. For this 13-foot-long association to matter, you have to have a pretty good definition of creativity — something that psychologist Judith Schlesinger, author of The Insanity Hoax: Exposing the Myth of the Mad Genius, argues is missing from the study. ""Creativity is simply defined by occupation,"" Schlesinger says, and this presumes two things. The first is ""that there are no creative accountants or lawyers who play music, paint, or dance wonderfully on the weekends, preferring to actually earn a living during the week."" The second is that ""everyone who self-defines as a writer, artist, and joins an artistic association, automatically qualifies as unusually creative"" — meaning that they ""don’t suck."" Overall, she says, this idea is ""scientifically hollow, but convenient for their purposes."" ""There is no way you can define it any differently."" Stefánsson acknowledges that there are some issues with his definition for creativity. ""There's absolutely no guarantee that...members of these associations are particularly creative,"" he says. It’s possible that what they found is that genetic variants, when combined, are more predictive of people who would like to be creative, rather than the ones who really are. But ""there is no way you can define it any differently. This is the best you can come up with in society,"" he says. But using an occupation-based definition to link creativity to mental illness is harmful, Schlesinger argues. It inadvertently encourages people who are artists and who have these illnesses to avoid treatment because they believe that latter causes the former. The same goes for the families of people who suffer from certain mental illnesses; some people may fail to address behaviors displayed by their creative kin because they’re considered beneficial among artists, she says. Finally, the findings may instill fear in people who are artistic. ""Society tells them that they're headed for it,"" Schlesinger says. ""These academics are up there in their towers, and they have no idea the damage they are doing. It's absolutely unnecessary."" ""These academics are up there in their towers..."" Yet Erik Thys, a psychiatrist at KU Leuven in Belgium who didn’t work on the study, thinks that the association could provide what he calls a ""positive stigma"" — one that could change the ""negative ideas about these people that prevail today, and are still very present in the media."" Shelley Carson, a psychologist at Harvard University, also thinks that these kinds of studies can lead to positive change. ""Both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are devastating illnesses,"" she says. ""However, work like the present study may help identify certain genetic aspects of these diseases that can confer benefits to humankind by increasing creative thinking."" This isn't the first study to make a link between creativity and psychosis. In 2013, Swedish researchers found a similar association. ""The findings are really interesting and support the idea of a real association between creativity and psychosis,"" says Simon Kyaga, one of the researchers behind the 2013 study and an epidemiologist at the Karolinska Institutet, in Sweden. But as with this current paper, Kyaga and his colleagues relied strongly on a person’s occupation to measure their creativity. ""People who are very gifted...often have inadequacies."" There's something tantalizing about being able to link creativity and mental illness. The association is both tragic and romantic, fulfilling humanity's need to explain away other people’s talents. As Stefánsson explains, the data ""shows that people who are very gifted — people who have special abilities — often have inadequacies; that is the price they pay for the genius."" We have used this argument many times in the past. How many people have heard others link classical composer Robert Schumann’s ""madness"" to the gorgeous music he wrote? There may be a link, but it doesn’t have to be one caused by a genetic ""inadequacy."" Many historians suggest that the composer suffered from an advanced form of syphilis — a disease that brings on symptoms that can be mistaken for mental illness. The association is both tragic and romantic There are tons of creative people out there who don't suffer from mental illnesses, and many less creative individuals do. Studies that perpetuate this idea without coming up with a more robust measure for creativity may be reaching for something that doesn’t exist. ""My overall impression [of this study] is of a pot filled with various types of pasta, with pieces taken out and thrown against the wall to see what sticks,"" Schlesinger says. The data demonstrating that profession is a good indicator of overall creativity are lacking. Some of the most creative people I know are coders, and they certainly aren’t being named among the creative class. If there is a link between creativity and psychosis — it’s entirely possible that one exists — we probably won’t be able to find it by looking at a person’s job. And, as far as the genetics go, we may want to find means of predicting schizophrenia and bipolar disorder that can account for more than 13 feet in a creative mile.",0.4870863483033788,0.5129136516966212,0.17166667467925487,1339,5.2964899178491409,606,6.6402640264026402,0,0,"Science, Report"

In this week's issue of Nature Nanotechnology, a Harvard research group is showing off a thin mesh that could track brain activity with less invasive implantation methods. It might not be a cranial surgical implant so much as a cranial injection. Flexible tech can stick straight to human or animal organs, allowing for close-up monitoring. Stretchy ""electronic tattoos,"" for example, could keep tabs on heart or breathing rhythms. But once scientists move beyond skin, these devices will need to be surgically implanted, which can raise difficulties. The Harvard team addressed this problem in a novel way. The mesh they created — made of thin polymer and metal threads — does the job of traditional electrodes, but it integrates into the brain, acting like a scaffold that cells can bind to. This structure creates a solid connection for tracking or stimulating individual neurons, but that's not the only advantage. It can also roll up to incredibly small widths, making it thin enough to be loaded into a 100-micrometer glass needle. And once it's injected into a region of the brain, it can relax and unfurl, blanketing the area around it. In their experiment, the researchers tested this on synthetic gel, demonstrating that it could actually unroll and settle into a brain-like structure. Then, they moved on to something more direct: injecting the mesh into real, live mice. In order to do so, they still needed to remove part of the skulls, but the researchers say it's a smaller area than purely surgical implants would require. Five weeks after the injection, the mesh had spread out, and imaging showed healthy neurons around it. It also served its purpose: the researchers could map brain activity by connecting to a set of tiny protruding wires. According to the accompanying Nature news article, the team hopes to move on to larger meshes with different types of sensors, and it wants to inject the mesh into newborn mice to see how it unwrapped as they grew. The paper also mentions a wireless interface. If human tests ever come, they'll be far in the future. But overall, it's research that can help us better understand the brain, and its applications could grow as we learn more.",0.3068500420717917,0.6931499579282083,0.18772547397139752,394,4.9720812182741119,251,6.0079681274900398,0,0,Science

Anil Potti was a rising star at Duke whose studies of cancer genetics drew heaps of praise — and research dollars — until his academic career crumbled under questions about his résumé, and the integrity of his findings. The stories of Potti and LaCour are mirror images of each other. That’s a good thing — it says a lot about how the scientific community is changing its approach to correcting its mistakes. The paper quickly raised red flags First, a primer on the case of Anil Potti — who, along with Duke, settled a number of lawsuits related to his research earlier this month. Potti’s rise began in 2006, when he and his mentor, Joseph Nevins, published a paper claiming to show that genetic ""signatures"" could predict how patients with cancer would respond to chemotherapy. That paper quickly raised red flags for biostatisticians at M.D. Anderson, a prominent cancer research center, who worried that the data were flawed. But none of the journals that published Potti’s supposedly breakthrough findings would run the critiques. Instead, the criticism ended up in a statistics journal, unknown to most cancer researchers. Though there was an investigation, Duke said the investigation’s findings gave them enough confidence to continue clinical trials based on Potti’s work. Then The Cancer Letter reported in 2010 that Potti had faked a Rhodes scholarship. After that, Duke halted the trials based on his research, and Potti resigned from his post. People began to look at his data with more skepticism, and Potti’s research’s validity quickly unraveled; his retractions now number in the double digits. Today, he practices oncology in North Dakota. When the statisticians drew first blood, the community listened But with LaCour, when the statisticians drew first blood, the community listened. Two graduate students at the University of California-Berkeley, were excited enough about his original study, published in Science in December, to try to extend the work. Upon close examination, though, they quickly found problems with the data, and contacted another author on the paper. He took their concerns seriously, and LaCour was forced to admit that he had faked the details of how surveys were conducted, and of how the study had been funded. The ensuing media scrutiny of his public persona dug up a fabricated résumé. Cleverly using a browser extension he installed ""to notify me when his website changed,"" Jesse Singal, at New York Magazine’s The Science of Us, has been doing a tick-tock of LaCour’s CV misrepresentations, including a nonexistent award (sound familiar?). LaCour’s paper was formally retracted on May 28th, and he offered a response to the allegations — which many found very wanting —on May 29th. As is often the case in such situations, another of his papers is already facing scrutiny. The résumé fibs may turn out to be an afterthought in the LaCour case The résumé fibs, damning as they are, may turn out to be an afterthought in the LaCour case. That’s the opposite of what happened to Potti, whose CV misdeeds were what forced people to think critically about his data — lying on his résumé, not falsifying data, ultimately brought down his research career. So what’s changed over the past five years? One important factor is the growing recognition among science journals that the tools of statistics represent an effective defense against fraud. Consider, for example, the current record holder for scientific retractions, Yoshitaka Fujii. Thanks to an intense statistical analysis, Fujii, a Japanese anesthesiologist, was found to have made up data in 172 studies. Combined with other papers in which he did not appear to have obtained the proper ethical approvals to perform his research, he now has 183 retractions, all in the past four years. It would be a hell of a lot better if journals applied such analyses to all studies prior to publication; the vaunted peer review system is supposed to be a quality filter. But given the sheer volume of papers released each year—at least 2 million and rising—that’s not realistic. And the quantity of papers likely won’t change anytime soon, given that academic career advancement depends almost entirely on publishing in peer-reviewed journals. If you want to see the self-correcting nature of science in action, check out PubPeer.com Fortunately, a growing movement called post-publication peer review offers a reasonable compromise. If you want to see the self-correcting nature of science in action — and by that we mean robust critiques, a number of which have led to corrections and retractions — check out PubPeer.com. The site, launched in 2012, allows commenters to discuss virtually any peer-reviewed paper that exists online. Post-publication peer review has been around as long as papers have been published, but it usually happens inside labs. PubPeer allows it to happen in public. The sophisticated Photoshop forensic tools used by commenters to uncover potential fraud can make most of the discussions quite technical, as you’d expect given the site’s audience of scientists. And not everyone likes PubPeer — especially some of the researchers whose work is being questioned. But PubPeer and other efforts, such as the Center for Open Science and work by the University of Pennsylvania’s Uri Simonsohn and colleagues, show that free and open critiques, powered by the internet, could dramatically speed up science’s self-correction process. Even in the decade before any of them became active, the number of retractions grew dramatically, from about 40 to 400, mostly because of better detection. Fake résumé scandals will still cripple lots of careers — and rest assured we’ll cover those stories. But relatively simple data analysis is a much more robust solution to weeding out fraud.

By analyzing poorly preserved dinosaur bone fragments, scientists have found structures that closely resemble red blood cells and collagen fibers, proteins found in various types of tissues. The finding is exciting because it contradicts a widely held belief that only exceptionally well-preserved fossils harbor soft tissues. And the fact that 75 million-year-old fossils hold these kinds of cells means that we may find similar tissues in other not-so-well-preserved bone fragments — a finding that could drastically increase our knowledge of dinosaur biology, behavior, and evolution. ""We were not expecting to find what we found at all."" ""We have several indications that the structures we found are consistent with red blood cells and collagen,"" explains Sergio Bertazzo, a physical chemist at Imperial College London and co-author of the study published in Nature Communications today.  ""We were not expecting to find what we found at all. So for us, every single discovery was quite exciting.""   Scanning electron micrographs of samples extracted from ribs of an indeterminate dinosaur displaying mineralized fibres. Credit: Sergio Bertazzo  They compared the red blood cells to emu blood cells In the study, researchers analyzed eight fossil fragments from two major dinosaur types, Ornithischia and Saurischia. To do this, they used a microscope called a ""focused ion beam,"" which is equipped with a beam of atoms that can make tiny, nanometric cuts into a bone sample. The microscope also had a robotic arm with a micro needle that could be used to pick up and move things inside the microscope, Bertazzo explains.""So, [by] combining the beam and the needle, we could cut small bits of the fossils and perform an analysis to check for any fragment of amino acids"" — protein building blocks. Thanks to this technique, the researchers were able to identify tiny structures that are probably red blood cells and collagen fibers belonging to the dinosaurs — something they never expected to find. The researchers confirmed the finding by comparing the red blood cell-like structures in the dinosaur bones to emu blood cells; birds and dinosaurs are distant relatives after all. If other researchers can find similar results, scientists might be able to use these collagen structures to better understand relationships between different species. And because red blood cell size is known to correlate with metabolic rate, it's possible that these organic structures could help scientists find out more about how dinosaurs evolved in warm-blooded creatures. Before this, the oldest un-degraded collagen was 4 million years old This isn't the first such discovery; researchers have been able to find soft tissues like this in other fossils. What sets this study apart is the fact that the researchers were able to find these materials despite the fact that the fossils weren't exceptionally well preserved. And before this finding, the researchers note in the study, the oldest un-degraded collagen ever recorded was about 4 million years old. There's one important limitation that's worth noting, however. It's possible that the red blood cells don't belong to the dinosaurs at all, Bertazzo says; contamination from other animals can't be ruled out. ""Even if it is quite unlikely that someone or some bird cut themselves and bled on the fossil at any point in time and right on the spot we took the smaller bit off, this is always a possibility.""   Credit: Sergio Bertazzo  And being able to identify structures like red blood cells and collagen in ""unexceptional"" fossils isn't going to lead to dinosaur de-extinctions — at least not any time soon. ""At the moment we have no evidence for any DNA,"" says Susie Maidment, a paleontologist at Imperial College London and a co-author of the study. DNA is much smaller than collagen fibers and red blood cells, which means that it degrades more easily. ""However, who knows what we might find in the future,"" she says. ""Unlikely that someone or some bird cut themselves and bled on the fossil."" Now that the study has been published, the scientists want to understand this type of preservation better. ""How far back in time does it extend? Is it restricted to a particular type of burial environment?"" Maidment asks. They also hope to find out how this type of preservation occurs. The discovery could have a big impact on fossilization science. ""Before this discovery, as a palaeontologist, I ‘knew’ that it was not possible for soft tissues to be preserved over geologic timescales, except in exceptionally rare circumstances,"" Maidment explains. ""What is most exciting for me is the potential this opens up: if we are able to find these tissues in other specimens, and replicate the results, it indicates this type of preservation might even be the ‘norm.'""",0.4542815894471114,0.5457184105528886,0.28839472884054357,809,5.1508034610630409,393,6.2315521628498729,1,4,"Science, Report"

The panel voted 13-3 in favor of Praluent — one of a new wave of medicines that target LDL cholesterol — but scientists note that definitive evidence that the drug can reduce heart problems will have to wait until full clinical trials are completed in 2017. The drug appears to cause no major side effects Praluent works by blocking a protein called PCSK9 that normally stops the liver from being able to fully clear LDL cholesterol from the bloodstream. Tests have shown that by taking the new drug, patients have reduced their cholesterol by between 40 and 65 percent, even if they have previously been taking cholesterol-managing statins such as Lipitor. The drug also appears so far to have no significant side effects on patients who do take it — the FDA has questioned whether it could cause forgetfulness or delirium, but appears to be satisfied with the safety studies conducted so far. Speaking to The New York Times, Harvard cardiologist Peter Libby said that drugs such as Praluent mean that ""the LDL issue is solved in principle."" But due to a lack of data, others in the medical field have urged caution in the use of the new medicine. So-called ""bad"" cholesterol has been shown to be significant in cardiovascular scientific studies, but the direct links between lowering LDL cholesterol and reducing the risk of heart disease are still not concrete. Brendan M. Everett, cardiologist at Boston's Brigham and Women's Hospital, told The Wall Street Journal he would only use the drug for patients genetically predisposed to high levels of cholesterol and avoid broader use. Some people with genetic mutations that also block the PCSK9 protein live perfectly healthy lives with very low cholesterol. But what is the effect on the body when someone with previously dangerous levels drops down to such a low LDL level? Should Praluent and its ilk be prescribed to anyone with heightened cholesterol, or saved only for people with critical levels in their bloodstream? And when statins have also been successful in reducing cholesterol to some degree, how much will this new, supposedly more effective treatment cost? A number of new cholesterol-reducing drugs are aiming to enter the market The product is one of two major new cholesterol-reducing drugs set to enter the market. Praluent — generic name alirocumab — was developed by Sanofi and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, while another similar drug, called Repatha, is the work of medical firm Amgen. Both companies estimate that their drugs will help millions in the US, but both have kept quiet about the price of a year-long course of their medications. Dr. William Shrank, chief scientific officer at CVS Health, estimates the cost to the patient at between $7,000 and $12,000 a year. If the drugs are only given to people who can't reduce their cholesterol low enough with statins such as Lipitor, Shrank told The New York Times, then the cost would be $16 billion. If it was widened out to encompass everyone with a history of heart disease, that price rises to $186 billion. Amgen's Repatha goes up against the FDA's advisory board today. While the administration doesn't technically have to follow the board's advice, it historically has, indicating that Praluent at least is likely to be approved. The government body does say, however, that if the large-scale trials underway by both companies don't show proof that the drug can dramatically reduce cholesterol and in turn prevent heart disease, then it will rescind that approval in a few years.",0.3536237242336337,0.6463762757663662,0.8269637706274914,614,5.0863192182410426,331,5.9939577039274923,0,0,Science

There are no moving parts, nothing appears to be coming out the back, and when you look inside, there’s nothing there either. This is the unbelievable premise behind the ""EM drive"" — a hypothetical space drive that we’ve been promised might one day take us to Mars, but that experts say is likely the result of nothing more than wishful thinking and scientific error. ""A small effort that has not yet shown any tangible results."" Like the machine itself, the coverage of the EM drive just keeps going and going, propelled, apparently, by nothing at all. A spate of articles earlier this month suggested that NASA itself had tested the drive and found it to work, something that the space agency refuted this week. ""While conceptual research into novel propulsion methods by a team at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston has created headlines, this is a small effort that has not yet shown any tangible results,"" a spokesperson told Space. People want the EM drive to be real for obvious reasons. It’s cool, it’s exciting, and it’s ludicrously optimistic. The drive was originally created by a British inventor named Roger Shawyer, who claimed if that if you bounced microwaves around a sealed metal container just so, you could create thrust at one end. No moving parts, no propulsion, just thrust. Such an engine would be a godsend for space travel, allowing scientists to build spacecraft without all that stupidly heavy, finite rocket fuel and instead launch something simply with enough solar panels to keep the engine functioning. With a working EM drive we could get to Mars in just 70 days, some have claimed, fulfilling that secular version of salvation — turning humanity into a multi-planetary species.  Ion drives may sound like science fiction, but they're very real. (NASA)   Except, of course, for the physics. If the EM drive did actually work, it would be breaking some of the most fundamental and thoroughly tested laws of the universe: the conservation of energy and momentum. The first of these states that you can’t simply create energy out of nothing, while the second says that to create movement (which is only a type of energy), you have to have some sort of equal and opposite movement.  Scientists who have backed the EM drive over the years are claiming to have created thrust from nothing, therefore breaking both laws at once. The EM drive — if it works — is like a dog straining at the leash, but with no dog. There’s no gas coming out the end (as with regular rockets), nor anything as insubstantial as ions (which is what makes very weak but very real ion thrusters work). And yet, say those involved, the drive is creating thrust. ""Like moving your car by pushing on the steering wheel."" ""It’s like saying you could get your car moving by sitting inside and pushing on the steering wheel,"" says Sean Carroll, a physicist and cosmologist at the California Institute of Technology. He adds that none of the explanations for why the EM drive might function make any sense. One of the theories states that the drive is somehow gaining traction by interacting with the ""quantum vacuum"" — a base layer of reality predicted by quantum mechanics to be full of tiny fluctuations giving rise to energy and matter. This, says Carroll, is entirely meaningless. ""It’s a complete misunderstanding of quantum field theory,"" he says. ""The quantum vacuum […] has no inertia of its own. Appealing to it to help explain dodgy experimental results is just a bit of technobabble."" This didn't stop the story spreading. In 2006, after Shawyer had received £250,000 from the British government to build the machine, the EM drive ended up on the front cover of New Scientist. The accompanying article was quickly shot down by various scientists (the magazine itself admitted they should have been clearer that the EM drive ""apparently contravenes the laws of physics""), and Shawyer disappeared from the story, but the ball was simply fumbled forward. ""NASA validates 'impossible' space drive."" In 2012, a Chinese team of scientists claimed they’d built their own working EM drive capable of producing a tiny amount of thrust without using any propellant. This produced a murmur of press coverage, but nothing too substantial. But then, in 2014, a marketing executive-turned-inventor named Guido Fetta said that he’d created his own version of the machine — rebranded as the ""Cannae Drive"" — that also worked. Fetta’s machine was tested by a small team of scientists from NASA Eagleworks — a group that focuses on advanced propulsion technology for spacecraft — who said that yes, amazingly, this thing was producing thrust. And while the drive seemed to be less powerful than in the Chinese experiment, it was still a staggering find. With this, the EM drive really took off, with a first report from Wired UK claiming that ""NASA validates ‘impossible’ space drive."" Various articles followed on a similar theme, many of them taking an appropriately skeptical stance, but giving credence to the claims nonetheless.  A prototype of the EM drive. (Roger Shawyer/EMdrive.com) However, as Discover Magazine pointed out in a thorough debunking of the entire concept of EM drives last year, the science produced by NASA Eagleworks just doesn’t stand up. Even ignoring various methodological ambiguities — especially over which parts of the test took place in a vacuum — the paper reported that thrust was generated by a version of the EM drive that was designed not to work. The difference between the two drives was that one had slots engraved in one side designed to create an ""imbalance"" in the microwaves (and thus, the theory goes, thrust), while the other had no slots. The fact that both versions were found to be creating thrust could suggest that the scientists involved don't quite understand what they've created, or that they made a mistake. Carroll says that the effects that the test was supposed to measure were small enough that they could easily have been created by a wide variety of experimental errors. A recent report, for example, revealed that radio signals of ""terrestrial origins"" supposedly picked up by Australian telescopes actually originated from a staff microwave. ""Experimenters make small mistakes all the time,"" he says, pointing to an infamous experiment from 2011 that appeared to show neutrinos moving faster than the speed of light. ""Real physicists knew it was nonsense from the start, but it caused a big media ruckus,"" says Carroll. ""In the end, of course, the results were traced to some loose cables."" No papers concerning the EM drive have ever been submitted for peer review That was last year, but the EM drive’s latest burst of speed is, unfortunately, no more credible. Last week, an article published on NASASpaceFlight highlighted claims made on the site’s forums by NASA Eagleworks scientist Paul March. March said on the forums that the EM drive had been tested yet again, this time in a vacuum, and it still worked. This test supposedly ruled out one of the ways that the drive might have been producing false results, with the ""thrust"" actually created by outside heat sources.  Many publications — including this one — wrote up the claims, even though nothing of substance had been added to the body of evidence supporting the EM drive. Notably, no paper purporting to show the drive functioning has been submitted to a peer-reviewed publication. Carroll, who hasn’t been involved with NASA Eagleworks’ experiments, says this is because the science is so clumsy — the methodology unclear, the explanations so nonsensical — that no paper on an EM drive would be accepted. We really, really want to the believe the EM drive is real So why do we keep on falling for this story? People really want to read about a NASA-approved space engine that not only breaks the laws of physics, but might also be the key to getting humanity off this rock. But there’s also more to it: for a start, while the basic concept of the EM drive is easy to grasp (magic box makes movement out of nothing), the supporting theory belongs to a realm of science that is, itself, kind of unbelievable. When you’re hanging out at the extremes of human knowledge, where even the experts are arguing among themselves about what's true, it can be hard to get a proper grip on what is a legitimate claim and what isn’t. The fact that the papers supposedly validating that the EM drive works were published by NASA also has something to do with it, even though  — as has been pointed out many times before — the space agency is a vast organization full of many moving parts and even then, is capable of being wrong. It funds all sorts of exotic-sounding experiments, and a few short papers published by a small team isn’t the same as the official party line. Unfortunately, what it does mean is that publications can attribute the work to NASA, and thus associate the results with what is a well-funded, rigorous, and trusted government body. We know that we really want an impossible space engine to work, and we know that so far there’s just not enough evidence for it. ""The strongest bias we have is to believe things that we want to think are true,"" says Carroll. ""Therefore, one of the tenets of doing good science is treat ideas that we want to be true with the highest levels of skepticism. What we're seeing here is the opposite of that. I would love to have warp drive or cheap space travel. I'm just not willing to throw out the laws of physics the first time someone claims to have built a machine that would make it possible.""",0.39905815741850725,0.6009418425814927,0.1629131809840757,1647,4.8858530661809354,745,6.3785234899328858,0,4,"Science, Transportation, Report, Space"

The Associated Press is reporting that four of the 48 self-driving vehicles licensed to operate on California roads have gotten into minor fender-benders since the state began issuing permits in September. Two of those accidents allegedly happened with the vehicles in self-driving mode; the others are being blamed on human error. Three of the cars were Lexus SUVs that are part of Google's intensive self-driving tests near the company's Mountain View headquarters. Delphi Automotive owns the vehicle involved in the fourth accident. The specific details around each incident aren't being revealed, since California law allows for collision reports to remain private. But according to the AP's source, none of them were severe crashes and each occurred at speeds of under 10 mph. Google blames these incidents on ""human error and inattention."" Delphi's self-driving Audi was ""moderately damaged"" after it was suddenly broadsided by another vehicle while waiting to turn left at a light. It was not in self-driving mode at the time. And in a statement, Google admitted that its Lexus SUV fleet has so far been involved in ""a handful of minor fender-benders, light damage, no injuries, so far caused by human error and inattention."" Google operates 23 Lexus vehicles that have been retrofitted with its autonomous driving sensors and other technology. Each contains security features like a kill switch that instantly disables the self-driving system. They are far more conventional than Google's own design for a self-driving car. But since this exciting concept remains so new to many, critics believe that companies pushing the cause of self-driving cars should share full details around any accident with the public and lawmakers. Google has now been involved in a total of six crashes when you include the three it quietly reported last year, spanning from when it began testing autonomous driving through May 2014. (The company told us most of those happened when its own cars were rear-ended by inattentive drivers.) Five other companies with similar permits told the AP they've so far avoided accidents on the road, and other states that allow self-driving tests (Nevada, Michigan, and Florida) reported no incidents.

Sometimes both. Yes, Inspired by Fashion is still a Wraith, with an overabundance of Rolls-Royce iconography scattered all over both the interior and exterior, but it doesn't feel much like the Wraith Inspired by Film we saw earlier this year. If anything, these two models stand at opposite ends of the Wraith spectrum. The two-tone exterior (Andalucian White and Arctic White) is less obvious here, but it does complement the thin, jasmine accent stripe that stretches on either side of the hood from the grill to the window. Rolls-Royce designer Michelle Lusby pointed out the softer materials, and indeed, the interior's use of silk and silk-like materials gave the car an overall more welcoming feel than its Film counterpart.  Of course, with Rolls-Royce, the emphasis is on bespoke, and the ""inspiration"" series is meant to serve as, well, inspiration for buyers who might want to add more personal touches. Or maybe just a tasteful package to take as is; Rolls-Royce North America President Erich Shepherd told us at the event that while 95 percent of all Wraith cars last year left with at least some element of bespoke design, most of the Inspired by Film buyers have so far taken the car without additional bespoke customizations. There's still at least one more ""inspiration"" model to come, albeit not until sometimes in the second half of this year.

First, the raw numbers: there have been 11 accidents in total, all minor, which Google asserts were never the fault of the car. Seven involved another vehicle rear-ending the Google car, two were sideswipes, and one involved another car traveling through a red light. In all, Google's post emphasizes two things: one, its sensors and algorithms are statistically far more attentive and less error-prone than a human driver is; and two, the error-prone behavior of the humans around it are feeding into better algorithms, making the Google car even safer than it already was.   An example of a dumb thing a human driver (in purple) did near a Google car, cutting it off to make a right turn. All told, it's a pure PR play by Google to spin the accidents in a way that makes its self-driving cars look good — and indeed, assuming the statistics are correct, they do look good. It's an especially smart message to get out into the world right now, as city, state, and federal governments struggle to wrangle the nightmarish web of regulation that will be required to make truly autonomous vehicles road-legal. (Daimler drove that message home with its self-driving truck last week, too.) So yes: Google — and other companies who've been working on this technology — have demonstrated that the technology exist to prevent these cars from hitting people, other cars, bicyclists, and to generally make sure they're not doing stupid things on the road. Sometimes you need a human to be unsafe on the computer's behalf The problem, though, is when they're too safe. Sometimes you need a human to be unsafe on the computer's behalf. Ford first brought this issue to my attention in a recent conversation with Mike Tinskey, the company's head of electrification and infrastructure. Besides expanding the network of chargers and technologies that are necessary to support the widespread EVs that are inevitably coming down the pipeline, Tinskey shares responsibility for many of the projects in Ford's ""Smart Mobility"" initiatives — a wide-ranging series of projects introduced at CES this year that involve using cars in unusual, non-traditional ways: ride-sharing, car-sharing, and so on. One of these Smart Mobility projects is called ""Remote Repositioning,"" which allows an individual seated at a computer to remotely drive a vehicle that's potentially thousands of miles away, using nothing more than an LTE connection and a few cameras and sensors. There are a variety of potential uses for it — remote valets, for instance — but another example Tinskey brought up was that of overcoming the excessively careful self-driving systems of the future: So you're saying that from the driver's perspective, the car will be self-driving, but really there's someone else driving it from afar for them? That's right. If you've ever had the pleasure to go to, for instance, China, if you're not aggressive to try to turn left, there will be people that will walk in front of you all day long. And an autonomous vehicle would end up sitting there forever. And a driver normally just has to kind of say, ""Alright, I'm going,"" and the people will stop and the car heads through. So there are going to be situations where a remote driver can actually pilot a vehicle better than an autonomous in certain conditions. Or just because of policy, that might be the way that we have to deal with it. Indeed, in Google's view of vehicle autonomy — as in the generally rational view — a car can never assume (or hope, at least) that a pedestrian will stop or jump out of the way the way a human driver can. Sometimes, simply moving (particularly in the world's most congested cities) requires a degree of cowboyishness that a stupidity-proof autonomous car can never permit. There needs to be a way for the car to say, ""well, I can't make this potentially dumb decision, but I invite a human to make it for me."" Google's self-driving research, and the growing PR campaign that surrounds it, are hyper-focused on eliminating as many dangers as they possibly can. But in the process, they risk compromising the very human realities that allow cars to move in the first place. (Coincidentally, Google notes that a majority of its accidents have taken place in urban environments, not rural ones.) It's this last mile of research — the interaction between autonomous vehicles and the urban jungles that will increasingly surround them — that promises to be the most interesting in the years to come.",0.464643131976832,0.535356868023168,0.7549985746972409,823,4.940461725394897,437,6.1464530892448517,1,2,"Transportation, Report"

Most editions are a mess of numbers, notes, translucent pages, and invariably tiny type. While the traditional arrangement makes for a great reference tool, it's anything but an easy read. Adam Greene, a book designer based in Santa Cruz, California, thinks he can change that with a Kickstarter for a new version of the Bible titled Bibliotheca. Bibliotheca is the realization of Greene’s long-held desire to help others discover the Bible. The premise is at once simple and daring: to lay out the Bible as a collection of literature, rather than a single encyclopedic volume. Bibliotheca consists of four volumes, three for the Old Testament and one for the New. There are no chapter divisions, no verse numbers, and no annotations. Greene hopes this will transform the biblical text, making it as easy to read as a New York Times bestseller. This newly arranged Bible isn’t meant to appeal to a particular demographic, nor is it intended to replace the more traditional format. Instead, Greene is targeting anyone who wants to ""enjoy the biblical library anew, as great literary art,"" and believes his creation could make people question ""the ubiquity of the encyclopedic form.""  ""Growing up with the Bible, there were so many interpretive lenses held up to it for me,"" Greene tells The Verge. ""As I grew older and learned more about its history, I began to see that it had been made to ‘say’ so many things to so many different ends over the past 2,000 years ... I couldn’t quite pin down what the Bible was, or why figuring out what it was mattered to me."" It wasn't until Greene was introduced to writings like N.T. Wright's Scripture and the Authority of God and Robert Alter's The Art of Biblical Narrative that he began to see the Bible as a library of liturgical texts ""compiled of masterfully crafted literary art, infused by its authors with needle-sharp significance, rich symbolism, and enthralling beauty."" Every element has been carefully considered to make reading a pleasurable experience Greene's background is in book design, and his understanding of the art behind a great book is infused into Bibliotheca. Every element of the four volumes has been carefully considered to make reading a pleasurable and distraction-free experience. It all starts with the spine and the way the volumes are bound, which together make up the first physical interaction a reader has with a book. Greene has chosen a European-style rounded spine with flat-opening sewn binding. This type of ornate binding has fallen out of favor for modern, mass-produced books, which generally have their pages glued directly to the spine, but it considerably improves readability.  Gluing pages to a book’s spine is known as ""perfect binding."" It leads to a ""v"" shape forming in the center of the pages, causing an endless battle between reader and book to keep it from closing in on itself, and can often lead to cracks and creases along the spine. With flat-opening sewn binding, however, the pages can bend and rotate freely, allowing the two pages you're reading to sit flat. It's a more expensive and time-consuming way of building a book, but it immediately creates a more enjoyable experience. This attention to detail extends to the text. Each page is laid out according to the measurements of the Ark of the Covenant, the chest described in Exodus that housed the tablets of the Ten Commandments. The text is left-aligned, rather than justified as in many Bibles, with each paragraph gently indented. The alignment is a simple change which Greene says will make the volumes far more readable. ""You're guaranteed the same optical rhythm on every line of text."" ""Even spacing contributes to legibility, equal line length does not,"" Greene explains. ""When typesetting, an optimal amount of space needs to be established in order to sufficiently isolate words without creating undesirable gaps. Justified text pushes and pulls on this space, and left-aligned text deploys it with absolute consistency ... You're guaranteed the same optical rhythm on every line of text."" In addition to carefully reconsidering the overall construction and layout, Greene has also crafted a pair of custom typefaces for Bibliotheca, a simple sans serif for titles, and a more adventurous typeface for the general text. His main motivation in creating what he aptly refers to as his ""original book typeface"" was to mimic the reverence that's given to text in Hebrew traditions, whereby a ""set apart"" script is used exclusively for sacred writings. Inspired by this tradition, Greene taught himself to write traditional letterforms by hand, before streamlining the letters into a coherent, idealized typeface. The result of this work is not radically different from the norm — Greene explains ""a good typeface does nothing so unruly or unique as to draw undue attention to itself"" — and draws inspiration from some of the last century's most influential type designers.  ""The two threads that run through ... are balanced contrast and rhythmic spacing, which are interdependent,"" says Greene. While the positive forms (the type itself) are carefully considered, equal consideration needs to be given to the space within and between each letter. Greene poetically describes the positive forms as ""dancing to the beat of the white space"" they rest in, explaining that ""the space within letterforms, the space interlocking letterforms as they combine to make distinct word units, and the space between word units as they combine to make fluid lines"" must each be contemplated when designing a typeface. There are other design flourishes to be found adorning Bibliotheca, including ribbon bookmarks and foil spine stamps for each volume. The pages are opaque, acid-free book paper, rather than the transparent sheets almost derogatorily referred to as ""Bible paper,"" and will be printed using traditional offset printing. These small touches all help Greene achieve his goal of making Bibliotheca’s volumes look, feel, and most importantly, read like books rather than like a giant compendium of biblical text. The text itself, and the splitting of the Old and New Testament into four distinct volumes, will likely be a problem for some. Greene has chosen the American Standard Version (ASV) of the Bible, and will modify it slightly to replace archaic terms with their modern alternatives (""doth"" will become ""does""; ""sitteth,"" ""sits""; and so on) and will be minimally adjusting the word order from the Young's Literal Translation (YLT). This will undoubtedly sit well with American audiences, but somewhat limits the appeal in international markets like the UK, where more neutral translations such as the New International Version (NIV) and New Revised Standard Version (NRSV) are more appealing. Many will find small issues with any translation or reworking of such a historically important text The division of the volumes is also contentious. Although the segmentation of the Old Testament into three categories (namely ""The Five Books of Moses & the Former Prophets,"" ""The Latter Prophets,"" and ""The Writings,"" which comprises everything from Psalms through to Chronicles) makes sense, grouping the entire New Testament into a single volume seems to go against the principles behind dividing the Bible in the first place. The four Gospels and Acts would make an extremely readable short novel, for example, and do not sit very well with the letters and Revelation that they precede. But while many will find small issues with any translation or reworking of such a historically important text, it’s undoubtable that Greene has put a lot of thought into making Bibliotheca appealing to as wide an audience as possible.  Speaking with Greene, it’s clear he has a real love for his craft. He bemoans the lack of quality first editions, and the general shift from publishers to save dollars per unit at the expense of ""the aesthetic and tactile experience."" He’s put hundreds of hours of work into the books already, and the long task of editing the text and laying out, printing, and binding the books awaits him after the Kickstarter campaign ends. When starting the crowdfunding drive, Greene asked for $37,000 to make Bibliotheca a reality as a small print run of 500 sets. The Kickstarter total currently stands at well over $300,000 with nearly 4,000 sets ordered, and those figures will likely rise before the campaign ends this Sunday. Greene accepts that digital books have eaten into the market of their traditional counterparts, but doesn’t necessarily equate their rise with the end of the paper and hardbacks. ""If we embrace digital forms for ephemeral content, and reserve the ‘reverence’ of a bound book for enduring literature, I think we’ll see a resurgence of intrinsically beautiful books,"" he explains. ""We need to critically allocate proper vehicles to varied types of content, not simply treat all literature the same. Read the news on your tablet, and then curl up with your clothbound, woodcut-illustrated copy of Walden.""",0.6188502516348348,0.38114974836516524,0.17909232944345066,1498,5.1522029372496663,759,6.6021080368906455,0,0,"Design, Report, Typography"

Rafael Gómezbarros' sculptures measure 50 centimeters (20 inches) in length, and are put together from materials like resin, fiber glass, and human skull casts. Entitled Casa Tomada (Taken House), the skin-crawling exhibit is meant to depict the plight of immigrant workers across the world. It is also a tribute to his countrymen whose lives have been affected by the Colombian conflict, which has been raging for half a century now. In an interview with The City Paper, Gómezbarros explains that he chose ants as his subject material as they represent a fascinating duality. While often symbolic of hard labour and cooperation, the insects are also frequently regarded as pests — just like the immigrant worker.

Bring it to them through the trusted Trojan horse of video games, of course. Next Wednesday, April 8th, the premier episode of Silicon Valley will stream on Twitch. That's the company that built a billion-dollar business around broadcasting gamers in action. It marks the first time any TV network has broadcast a show on Twitch. Video games as Trojan horse Staying true to the format, the Silicon Valley cast will kick things off with a live chat on a couch, answering questions from the crowd and showing off their joystick skills before streaming the episode and some exclusive clips. What HBO gets out of this is obvious: it's putting its show in front of a huge new audience, roughly 100 million monthly active users. ""We were initially impressed by the scale of Twitch as a platform,"" said Sabrina Caluori, HBO's vice president of digital and social media. ""As we began working with them, we discovered that there's real quality engagement in addition to huge reach — it's rare to find both."" So what does Twitch get out of this? Over the last six months, the company has pushed aggressively to expand its repertoire beyond video games. It became the exclusive streaming partner for the Ultra Music Festival and hosted debuts from Skrillex and Diplo. With the HBO announcement, it is trying to flex its muscle in yet another area of entertainment. In the marketing campaign for the Ultra Festival we see a young man — Dutch DJ/Producer Martin Garrix — playing video games on Twitch when a little pop up on his phone alerts him to some live music. He switches over with a click. In a world where HBO has finally cut the cord and is offering a standalone streaming subscription, HBO Now, it is probably keen to find lots of new models for distribution.  Beyond just the size of the audience, Twitch has also pioneered a new model for monetization. There is usually a very active chat room running alongside the stream. Viewers can subscribe and leave donations to avoid ads and get noticed by broadcasters. Mix that mechanic with big name celebrities, and you might create a very lucrative revenue stream for television. Twitch has pioneered a new model for monetization Silicon Valley lead Thomas Middleditch actually has a Twitch account with a little activity on it, and the press release bills the cast as real-life gamers. It's hard to know how much of that is true and how much is just good marketing copy, but the partnership definitely represents an interesting experiment for both companies.

During rotations, if he’s feeling bored, he likes to whip out his smartphone and browse through Figure 1, a mobile app he compares to Instagram for doctors. He will offer suggestions on difficult diagnoses and favorite particularly beautiful photos of growths, gashes, and gangrene. By and large the service is used by medical professionals, but every once and a while, a picture is worth sharing with everyone. ""My dad works in hardware sales, so I had to show him this one picture of a patient with a two-by-four through his chest,"" says DeVito. ""There are images on here that anyone can connect to."" I downloaded Figure 1 a few weeks ago as I was preparing to write this article. Doctors would post images along with a description of the patient and the condition. Photos are tagged and organized by anatomy and speciality. Sometimes the poster would ask for advice. But just as often they wanted to highlight a particularly interesting x-ray, brutal injury, or before-and-after image of a successful surgery. I immediately felt like an interloper, prying into people’s deeply disturbing and tragic moments, and listening in as doctors discussed the prognosis. Only medical professionals can comment, but anyone can view the exchange of shop talk.   Figure 1 was created after Joshua Landy, a critical care physician, spent a semester as a visiting scholar at Stanford, studying how doctors were using their smartphones to communicate. It turned out that plenty of them were already exchanging images through email, text messages, and social media. ""But there was a big privacy problem there,"" says Landy, now the chief medical officer at the company. Identifiable information about patients was often left intact. ""While people were sharing knowledge, it wasn’t being done in a way that you could index, search, or scale."" The service, headquartered in Toronto, launched in May of 2013 and has since grown to 19 employees and hundreds of thousands of active users who view over 2 million images a day. Landy had imagined that Figure 1 would be a sort of an updated medical textbook or teaching file, a place to store images that illustrated a particular condition and could be used for education. But as the community on the app grew, it became something he hadn’t expected, a real-time resource doctors could use to crowdsource advice. Take the photo submitted by a nurse of a patient with a persistent and mysterious rash that had stumped all her local practitioners. In the comments someone suggested Porphyria, the ailment behind the madness of King George. ""I would never have come up with this if not for Figure 1. It’s extraordinarily rare — so rare that no one even looks at it as a possibility,"" the nurse wrote in a letter to the company. ""I’m very grateful to your site because otherwise she wouldn’t have much longer.""   Just as strikingly, the nurse pointed out that the person who suggested Porphyria was still a medical student who had learned about the disease as an oddity during the first few weeks of class. ""The biggest value of Figure 1 is hearing from people across the whole spectrum of medicine,"" says James Sancrant, a radiologist at Triad Radiology Associates in North Carolina who has been using the app for about a year. ""As a specialist, your focus can really narrow down, and the conversations on here help to round that back out."" The advice that flows through the app often crosses borders, bringing novel medical techniques to new parts of the world. ""When you’re part of a hospital or clinic, you have a certain team that does things one way,"" says Andrew Kesselman, a resident at SUNY Downstate. ""On Figure 1, I’m constantly learning new things by listening to doctors in Europe, who have access to different tests and tools."" Figure 1 asks users to remove all personal details and identifying marks such as tattoos. It has built-in tools so users can blur out faces and an algorithm that scans for and tries to block faces as well. A Figure 1 team reviews all images after they are uploaded to ensure they don’t contain any personal details which might be a violation of patient’s privacy. ""I once posted something that had a portion of a date on it, I think the year,"" said DeVito. Figure 1 rejected it for that little detail.  If someone flags an image because they think the patient can be identified, Figure 1 says it will remove and destroy the photo. With these precautions in place, the service positions itself outside of HIPAA regulations in the US and similar rules abroad, meaning many doctors don’t need any explicit permission from patients to take and share images. If their workplace or jurisdiction does require patient consent, the app has a ""tap, type, sign"" feature built in.  Popular posts on Figure 1 typically have hundreds of comments and favorites. The service also has its equivalent of the uplifting, inspirational messages you often see on Pinterest and Instagram. One of the most popular photos uploaded to Figure 1 is a tiny heart being cradled in the palm of a hand, about to be transplanted into a 13-month-old patient. It’s a bittersweet moment, given that it required a donor, but one that left commenters with a sense of joy at the power and progress of medicine, something to restore their faith in the profession amidst all the trauma. ""I am so moved by this picture. What a powerful gift,"" wrote one commenter. ""This is why I love the medical field.""   Right now the company is run with venture capital and has no immediate plans to introduce any revenue-generating products. But talking with users, I could see some possibilities for the future. All of the users I spoke with said that they frequently consult the app when they need advice on a case or just feel like having a second opinion. ""You build up confidence in power users, you come to trust them,"" says Kesselman. As a frequent poster, he is hopeful the activity on the app will translate into real world success. ""In the future, I could definitely see putting some of my statistics from Figure 1 on my resume."" The service integrated with Doximity, a sort of LinkedIn for doctors, to better verify who users are. ""Anyone can download the app and say they are a medical professional,"" says DeVito. ""That was a great update, because now you can have confidence following the advice of a commenter you don’t know in real life."" The idea was just to familiarize myself with the app so I could talk with doctors, but I ended up getting sucked into the stream of grisly photographs. There was a real curiosity the app awakened about how medicine works and a sense of awe at the resilience of the human body. Compared to the baby pictures and pet portraits that make up my Instagram and Facebook feed, it was a visceral change of pace. As it turns out, I’m not the only lurker from outside the world of medicine spending time on Figure 1. The company says roughly 10 percent of its user base is just curious folks like me. One of the most popular subjects on Figure 1 is gallstones. The shiny green rocks, covered in a glistening, semi-translucent slime, are typically framed and lit with far more attention to detail than other pictures. They are the carefully plated brunch of medical maladies.   I got that sense interviewing users. While lots of doctors are on Figure 1 to learn and share knowledge, sometimes it’s just another good distraction. ""I want to share this stuff but it's not always safe or acceptable to do so on normal social networks,"" says Sancrant. ""If I have 10 minutes of downtime and I want to decompress, instead of playing Angry Birds I’ll pull up Figure 1.""",0.6349424751470287,0.36505752485297127,0.8427197348610825,1341,4.7912005965697242,681,6.2951541850220263,0,16,"Apps, Business, Science, Tech, Report"

At some point in time I added my email to Square, so usually I choose that option and get a digital receipt instead of a paper one. Starting today my local shop owner could pay Square to send me a promotional email, part of a new offering called Square Marketing. As the company explains in its press release, ""Square gives you something no one else can offer: pre-organized lists of customers who’ve already visited your store — whether loyal, casual, or lapsed — so you can target the right audience with the right message from day one. You might invite loyal customers to a ""Friends and Family"" event or maybe re-engage lapsed customers with a special deal."" Fingers crossed for a deal on Junior Mints I've got my fingers crossed for a half-off deal on Junior Mints after midnight, but in the meantime, it's worth asking what this move means for Square as a business. The company was reportedly preparing for an IPO back in November of 2013. But subsequent reports painted a darker picture, with allegations that it was running low on cash and in talks to be acquired. The company denied those rumors, and talk of an IPO quieted. Square raised $150 million in a new round of funding. Over the last year and a half, it has been busy rolling out new products. 10 cents an email Square Marketing is part of the ever-expanding offerings the company is making to merchants. Along with their card reader and register, Square offers analytics and even loans, both backed by the data it collects on purchases. Getting analytics on customer behavior has been free so far, but this new product shows Square thinks merchants might be willing to pay for the consumer data it has amassed. The company will charge 10 cents per send for its marketing emails, or $15 to send unlimited emails to 500 customers. ""In the near term it won't add a ton of revenue but this and other future marketing services over time could become a meaningful source of revenue for the company,"" says Greg Sterling, vice president of strategy at the Local Search Association. ""True email marketing isn't as sexy as other channels but it can be very effective and it's heavily used by small and medium businesses, so there isn't a ton of education that the company needs to do.""   The company claims that ""during our pilot, sellers who sent out promotions saw open and redemption rates at two times the industry average. Those numbers translate into real dollars: Square sellers generated nearly $1,000,000 in sales tied directly to promotion redemptions."" There's lots of competition for the marketing dollars small and medium business owners spend. Online it's common to track someone from an offer to the actual website and see if they made a purchase. The one thing Square can offer that Facebook or Google can't is the ability to see when a customer targeted with an ad actually comes in a physical store and buys something, unless of course they're using good old-fashioned cash.",0.2140460510878488,0.7859539489121512,0.939369368884098,580,4.7017241379310342,342,5.7222222222222223,0,0,"Business, Tech"

New Shepard will be launched, uncrewed, from Blue Origin's basecamp in Texas about a dozen times before the company will allow pilots to take part in the tests, Reuters reports. And in the meantime, Blue Origin will start working on attaching the motor to the capsule. Like Virgin Galactic's SpaceShipTwo —  a ship that crashed in October, leading to a pilot's death — New Shepard is a suborbital spaceship.

That same day, Meerkat's popularity in the app store peaked, then started to fall off a cliff, plunging out of the top 500 before stabilizing this morning. So what happened? There are some simple explanations. Meerkat founder and CEO Ben Rubin says the company was featured in the app store for a week, saw a huge spike in downloads, and is now simply back to where it began. Meerkat's popularity is sliding because its hype got ahead of its actual traction, and we are now seeing a correction as the press and promotion dies down.   Last Thursday was also the day that Twitter debuted its Meerkat competitor, Periscope. I watched as many of the early adopters who had been experimenting with Meerkat moved over and started using Periscope instead. It wasn't a total exodus, but where there had been effectively one choice, there were now two. And three days later, no doubt thanks to the power of its parent company, Periscope had passed Meerkat in size, at least in terms of Twitter mentions, which is the central mechanism for distribution for both. Third day. pic.twitter.com/xnBd27zTvC  Meerkat's slide in the app store inspired a blistering editorial from Tero Kuittinen, who bashed the journalists and investors praising it as the next big thing. ""There is also no doubt that if Jared Leto and his merry band had realized a week ago that Meerkat would drop out of the top 500 iPhone app chart by Sunday night, they would have slammed their check books shut in a hurry. They were obviously blinded by the tech journalism flimflammery that has gone on unabated in America in recent weeks."" It's worth asking if the tail wags the dog in startup circles these days. The market for venture capital investment — and subsequent headlines about those billion-dollar valuations — is definitely frothy. I don't think that means however, as several articles have argued, that the app is destined for the deadpool. Meerkat's hype got ahead of its traction The problem with both Meerkat and Periscope right now is that when you open the app, you are greeted with a completely random collection of streams. Most of them are just ordinary people living their lives, and the average day for most people is pretty boring. Most broadcasters haven't learned what makes for compelling content, and the apps aren't robust enough yet to suggest great stuff when you open it. We're still in the embryonic stage of mobile live streaming. Think of it like Twitter when most people just tweeted about what they had for breakfast. That leads us to a more interesting question: can live streaming be the basis of a sustainable consumer product? Pseudo, Qik, Justin.TV, uStream, and many others either sold out, folded, or pivoted to the enterprise.  It's been a sort of holy grail for internet evangelists since the 1990s, but didn't make sense until we all had good cameras in our pockets, supported by fast data connections and underpinned by robust social networks. A fad or a phenomenon? With those pieces in place, however, live-streaming services like YouNow are building big audiences and generating serious revenue. This is not a fantasy product whose users consist solely of techies and journalists. It's a cashier from Brooklyn and a teenager from North Carolina and a dentist from Egypt who have built passionate fan bases. I don't know if the culture on YouNow will translate to Meerkat and Periscope, to the mainstream of live streaming in other words. Hundreds of teens will watch their favorite performer sleep for hours on YouNow, keeping each other entertained with conversation in the chat. I doubt that sort of scintillating content is going to help Meerkat or Periscope find its audience.  Data from Bitly Brand Tools These new apps will probably follow the 90, 10, 1 rule, first laid out by tech investor Fred Wilson to describe Twitter. One percent of the users will create the interesting content, 10 percent will curate it, and 90 percent will simply consume it. Media and celebrities will be the anchors. Hundreds of people tuned in live yesterday to watch The Verge show off the new Galaxy S6 and to see deadmau5 take his first ride in his new McLaren. A few native live-streaming stars will emerge. And ordinary people will have the occasional moment — look, a double rainbow! — when live streaming makes sense. If standalone apps fail, it will become a feature baked into Twitter, Facebook, and Snapchat. Does that mean Meerkat is going to thrive? The backlash and scrutiny from the press that built them up will no doubt be brutal. And it's tough to compete with a product being pushed by the same platform you're relying on for distribution and engagement. They have millions in the banks and some very famous funders. I think mobile live streaming is here to stay, but you'll have to stay tuned to see who survives.

It was largely a response to 2001's Enron scandal, when the energy company was able to hide billions of dollars in debt due to corporate loopholes and a little creative accounting. The bill, known as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, was signed into law by President Bush in 2002. It could carry up to a 20-year sentence Since then, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act has subtly provided the legal groundwork for prosecuting people for something like deleting their browser history. One such case is that of Khairullozhon Matanov, a 24-year-old former cab driver who ate dinner with Tamerlan and Dhzokhar Tsarnaev the night of the Boston Marathon bombings. Federal prosecutors have charged Matanov under Sarbanes-Oxley for destroying evidence, The Nation reports. According to The Nation, Matanov learned that the Tsarnaevs were suspects in the bombing a few days after the dinner, and went to talk to local police in Quincy, Massachusetts. He reportedly told a few lies to the police, including when he and Tamerlan had last prayed together. And then he wiped his internet browser history and deleted videos from his computer. In May 2014, after being tracked by the FBI for more than a year, Matanov was charged with four counts of obstruction of justice, with one count for ""destroying any record, document, or tangible object with intent to obstruct a federal investigation,"" which carries a possible sentence of up to 20 years in prison, The Nation reports. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act is largely related to corporate financial reporting, but one section, Section 802, imposes severe penalties for ""destroying, mutilating, concealing, falsifying records, documents, or tangible objects"" with intent to impede or stall a federal investigation. Its vague and far-reaching rhetoric allows it to be applied to even non-tangible, personal information like stored records of online activity. There is a precedent for this kind of prosecution. In 2010, University of Tennessee student David Kernell was convicted under Sarbanes-Oxley for deleting certain information from his computer and clearing his web browser's cache after hacking into Sarah Palin's Yahoo email account, according to The Nation. Intent is difficult to prove Such broad interpretation of a law that was originally meant to apply to large corporations highlights already simmering questions of what the federal government's access to citizens' data should actually look like. Because intent is difficult to prove, the current interpretation of Section 802 could make it possible for the feds to charge citizens for deleting data at any point in time, were it to end up becoming potential evidence at a later date. This past March, Matanov pleaded guilty to the four counts of obstruction of justice, hoping for a 30-month plea deal. His sentencing is scheduled for later this month.",0.557262313631366,0.442737686368634,0.8587462454518503,477,5.3417190775681345,299,6.2842809364548495,0,0,"Culture, Policy & Law, US & World, Web"

Despite this, they react like a crowd at a football match, letting out oohs and aahs in unison, responding to some unseen action. Suddenly, a small drone skitters out of the trees on their right, crashing through the brushes before landing in a spray of dirt and leaves. There’s a cheer from the begoggled watchers and a small round of applause. This is the world of first-person drone racing, an activity that currently occupies the ill-defined ground between dedicated pastime and fledgling sport. As drones become an increasingly mainstream phenomenon, racing leagues have popped up around the world. Anyone who takes it seriously — pilot or spectator — doesn't watch their craft from a distance, but instead uses mounted cameras and special video goggles to see the world from their drone’s perspective, also known as first-person racing or FPV.    ""We’ve had a quarter of the people complete the course so far,"" says Thomas Greer, a 25-year-old network engineer from Glasgow who runs the FPV League. ""Which is more than I expected."" He says that although a few of the participants in the race — the first to be thrown by the newly formed FPV League — are professional pilots who do commercial filming work by drone, they still struggle with this sort of precision racing. ""You need to be good with spatial awareness and know exactly how wide your quad is. There’s no point in thinking, ‘Yeah, I can get through that gap’ and forgetting about the propellers."" The racers are all men of mixed ages, wearing mostly jeans, T-shirts, and cargo shorts. More than a few work in the computer industry in one capacity or another, and all are racing small, custom-built drones constructed around 25-centimeter-long X-shaped carbon fiber frames, with four propellers —or props — on each corner. Although the video goggles let them fly from anywhere nearby, today's race has a special cordoned-off area in the middle of the track for pilots, where they take a seat in picnic chairs, leaning into the corners as they race as if playing an intense session of Mario Kart.   ""It’s a bit like [a video game] apart from it’s not virtual,"" says Bradley Austin, a 23-year-old first-time FPV racer who teaches video game design for a living. ""In a game you crash, you reload, you crash, you reload. If you crash [your drone] you’ve got to go pick it up and solder it back together — so you’ve got that adrenaline going that your £600 investment might smash into a tree."" Crashing is both a constant threat and a shared joy at FPV races. Some drones are clothes-lined by tree branches, others get snarled in bushes, some bounce off the rocks, and more than a few fail before they’ve even crossed the starting line, thrashing about on the floor in a cloud of leaves and dirt like a toddler throwing a tantrum. The best crash, however, goes to a pilot who manages to get his drone wedged between a pair of trees (just as Greer predicted). When his heat is over and the marshals have given the all clear, he and a few other pilots race down to where the drone is stuck, taking pictures in front of the craft and declaring it the ""crash of the day"" like hunters posing with a kill.   Although in this particular crash the drone comes away unscathed — the pilot puts it down to a brand of ""indestructible props"" he’s been buying from China — more often than not there’s repair work to be done between races. Up the hill from the course in the grass garden of what was once a stately house (and that’s now home to a scientology center), there’s a gazebo full of chargers and spare parts, and a taped-off area for pilots to test out their on-the-fly adjustments. More time is spent tinkering than racing, but quadcopter racing comes with a deep well of arcane detail for pilots to engross themselves in — everything from battery discharge rates to the proper way to balance propellers can be debated and fiddled with. Like a lot of enthusiasts who find their field of interest embraced suddenly by the wider world, the quadcopter pilots display a particular mixture of derision and pride when chatting about the popular acceptance of the craft. They’re irritated by the idea of kids buying camera-equipped DJI Phantoms to ""take a peek next door,"" but joke easily about the possibility of a ""drone Olympics,"" with just the slightest hint of seriousness. They also, for the record, don’t like to call them drones and prefer the term quadcopter — but popular usage is a hard rap to beat. When asked how much it costs to get into the sport, one pilot laughs and responds: ""Do you want the official cost, or the wife-cost?"" (The atmosphere around the charging tent is friendly and open, but extremely male — I only spot one female spectator and no female pilots.) He says that although you can get started in the sport with a £150 mini quad, once you’ve bought the video goggles, a transmitter, charger, spare batteries, and other assorted bits of kit, total expenditure usually hits around £600 or $920. Of course, says another pilot, that’s just for a single drone, and enthusiasts own more than one, with different frame sizes and rotor setups. ""You need to look at the rules,"" he says. ""The correct number of drones to own is n+1 … They multiply, they self-multiply.""   The winning craft in the day’s racing looks particularly chic, with neat wiring, green, bug-like antenna, and a central camera that makes it look like a cute Cyclops. It belongs to Dominic Clifton, a software engineer who also designs an open-source flight controller for drones used by many of the pilots in attendance. As he accepts the prize money for his winning flight time (you can watch the footage from his drone above), the day’s racing suddenly begins to feel somewhat official. There are outbreaks of applause and photographs, and Greer gives a short speech thanking both the participants and the day’s sponsors — a UK-based supplier of drone parts named RadioC. Whether FPV drone racing is headed for the big time or not is a popular topic of conversation. More than a few organizations have already taken the initiative and declared themselves the official so-and-so league for their own country or region, but as sports go, FPV drone racing still feels refreshingly free-wheeling. Some people might dismiss this as amateurism, but in East Grinstead's scrubby woodland, it feels accessible and welcoming. Greer tells me that at the moment he’s more interested in changing perceptions about the aircraft than becoming the Sepp Blatter of the drone world. ""Where it goes in the future, I don’t know is the honest answer."" ""Where it goes in the future, I don’t know is the honest answer,"" says Greer. ""This is just a hobby for me but I seem to be good at organizing things."" He adds that at the end of June he’ll be taking some of the League’s drones and goggles to a nearby model show to let the public get a proper hands-on. ""We’re going to give people a chance to try and see it for themselves, so they can experience flying from the quadcopter perspective,"" he says. ""By giving people the opportunity to see how much fun it is and how easy it is…"" He trails off.

Today, Kaspersky Labs published a postmortem on what it calls Duqu 2.0, a derivative of the Duqu program it investigated in 2011; Kaspersky has previously tied Duqu to Stuxnet. Where Duqu and Stuxnet were studied as part of outside investigations, though, Duqu 2.0 appeared right in Kaspersky's network. ""The thinking behind it is a generation ahead of anything we'd seen earlier — it uses a number of tricks that make it really difficult to detect and neutralize,"" writes CEO and co-founder Eugene Kaspersky in a blog post. Kaspersky Labs researchers say that around six months ago, unknown hackers targeted an employee from an Asia Pacific satellite office. While it's been difficult to reconstruct exactly what happened, they believe the employee received a targeted phishing email containing a malicious attachment. Once it was opened, the malware took advantage of multiple zero-day exploits — previously unknown security flaws that software developers haven't had time to fix — to insinuate itself into the machine. One of the key holes, according to the company's report, wasn't actually patched until June 9th of 2015. Kaspersky discovered the invasion in early 2015, when one of its researchers observed unusual bugs while testing a prototype of new security software. After realizing that the computer was infected, the company started monitoring the spread of the unknown virus. Slowly and almost invisibly, it spread through what Ars Technica — in its excellent recap of the case — calls ""dozens"" of machines in Kaspersky's network. ""The thinking behind it is a generation ahead of anything we'd seen earlier."" Kaspersky insists that the malware compromised neither its security services nor its customer data. Eugene Kaspersky speculates that the hackers were spying on its ongoing security investigations or research and development. What's particularly worrying, though, is that the sophisticated Duqu 2.0 is almost certainly a government project — and Kaspersky wasn't its only target. Since finding the malware, the company says it's uncovered Duqu 2.0 breaches in three hotels that were used for negotiations over Iran's nuclear program. As The Wall Street Journal reports, it was also found on the site of a 70th anniversary commemoration of liberating Auschwitz, where hackers could potentially have spied on world leaders. Duqu 2.0 modules could reportedly have hijacked security camera footage, pulled data off phones or computers connected to Wi-Fi, turned on microphones to eavesdrop on conversations, and accessed the front desk computers at the hotels. Kaspersky says it's still investigating what it believes is a much larger spread of targets. Based on the choice of targets and other circumstantial evidence, Israel may be the most likely suspect in these attacks. While US involvement in this particular case apparently looks more dubious, the US and Israel are widely suspected to have developed Stuxnet in partnership, Duqu is firmly linked to Stuxnet, and researchers say it would be extremely difficult for an outside developer to replicate Duqu closely enough for Duqu 2.0. Kaspersky, however, has refrained from naming any specific countries.",0.8533733327606574,0.1466266672393426,0.11291131591597336,521,5.4817658349328218,306,6.6013071895424833,0,0,"US & World, National Security"

All of Tomorrowland will be transformed, adding themed food locations, with the classic ride Space Mountain transformed into a X-Wing battle called Hyperspace Mountain. A new fireworks show will also be part of the Season of The Force event, which will kick off early next year. Disneyland has tackled themed makeovers of rides in the past.

As you can imagine, it's a crowd that's very prone to getting excited — but nothing in today's Pixar and Disney Animation presentation made the audience explode like the appearance of one man. A nearly mythic, transcendent figure who will clearly become one of Disney's most beloved heroes: Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson. The surprise appearance was part of the discussion of Disney Animation's upcoming film Moana. The film follows a young girl, named Moana, as she sails across the Pacific Ocean — but one of the individuals she ends up teaming up with is named Maui. No name had been attached to that role, but after a teasing intro, in which The Rock intoned from offstage about how the filmmakers needed to find somebody handsome and charming to play Maui, he bounced on stage, cellphone in hand, taking selfies of himself with the huge crowd behind him. Quite simply, the crowd went insane. They cheered louder than they had at mentions of Frozen. They whooped wilder than they had when Star Wars and Captain America: Civil War were briefly featured in a sizzle reel. They clapped harder than they did when there was mention of Toy Story 4. Of course they did. Because it was The Rock. At that moment, I'd like to think the entire crowd all felt a little bit like my colleague Casey Newton did last year. When he got into the entertainment business, Johnson said, ""I had a goal. And the goal was to be in the Disney family."" (I'd like to think another goal was breaking an arm cast just by flexing, but the topic didn't come up.) He then praised the filmmaker's attention to detail in researching the cultures and traditions the film is based upon. ""I am proudly half-Samoan, and I am proudly half-black,"" The Rock said, before cracking another set of delightful jokes and introducing a clip from Moana. (His character, while named after a demi-god, appears to be a teenaged boy with a ridiculous sense of humor, all of which seems tailor made for a former wrestler that's since turned himself into one of the most well-known movie stars in the world.)

It was gnawing at me, shriveling up around my hair follicles, so itchy I had to tense my entire body to keep from scratching it. I was sure it was getting bigger every day. Standing in front of the mirror in the bathroom of the apartment where I no longer lived with Drake, I turned my head forward, then to the right at a 45-degree angle. My eyes strained to see the spot near the back of my scalp. My fingers raked the area, hunting for the hardened bloody sore. When I found the scab, I teased it with my index finger until one edge curled up like a chameleon’s tongue, and then slowly, but with the precision and confidence of a surgeon who has only performed this very specific surgery, I pulled the scab from my head, ripping free a patch of skin along with it. I could feel the streams of blood funneling through my hair.  The sky outside was dark red. That’s not symbolic — a chemical spill at the Johnson & Johnson plant in New Toronto (formerly Toronto) in 2025 had changed the color of the sky from blue to cotton candy pink to its current red. The spill had already destroyed nearly all of the Western Hemisphere and was still spreading. Destruction was slow. There were no city-ending explosions; no untamed riots in the streets; no vials of cyanide available for those who couldn’t bear the wait. Just the painfully slow deterioration of everything, like the bothersome need to sneeze without the relief of it ever coming. Because the city’s only news was the chemical spill, Channel 4 Toronto weatherman Tom Bonson found himself temporarily out of a job and spent his days sending  Twitter dispatches about his green screen withdrawal. Our local dog grooming business, Soapy Paws, had shuttered its doors because all disposable income in the city was being funneled into human skin care. The end of the world, it turned out, was not good for your skin. During the summer of 2026 — this was years after the chemical spill — I worked at NPR, where it was my job to clean Terry Gross’ breathing mask. All the hosts were given FDA-approved masks to protect their superhumanly perfect voices. Terry drank nothing but milk, claiming that dairy was, in fact, the best thing you could do for your vocal chords, and anyone who said otherwise was a dumb-witted sycophant. I, of course, agreed. The inside of her mask was always slightly dewy and speckled with an off-white cream crust. The oils from her face left a Terry Gross-shaped imprint. Once I caught the kid who cleans Ira Glass’ mask huddled in the storage room, his nose to Glass’ plastic mouth-mold, inhaling deeply. At the time, I was living with Drake, whose royalties were still coming in from his greatest hits album. Despite the fact that the radiation had rendered government-issued currency basically irrelevant, we managed to maintain a grotesquely styled Art Deco condo in downtown New Toronto. After seeing Anthony Kiedis of the now-defunct Really Hot Chili Peppers Collective dancing for change one night in the street, we hired him to be our butler. We shaved his head for fun on rainy nights, and his hair grew back by dawn. He slept between us when we fought. Drake tended to claw the air when he went to bed angry, and Anthony Kiedis took the brunt of the scratches, which was fine by me. I was worried enough about my skin as it was. They told us that cleaning up the radiation entirely would be impossible. They could treat some of it, and the rest would slowly creep into our bodies, paralyzing our internal organs, crippling our lungs, and eventually our hearts, killing us. It would take years, they said, but it would happen. For now, the pain was mostly aesthetic. Small red bumps cropped up on my triceps like stubborn armies of red ants. Drake and I stopped having sex.   As I spent more and more time alone, I began taking Anthony Kiedis’ poodle, Bubbles, on long walks through the city. One morning, while Bubbles and I were out, I ran into our neighbor, Bono. Bono’s heyday as a well-known rock musician had ended decades prior, and he was very old, but he was immediately recognizable. He had that strong jaw, jutting into the sky like Florida out from the United States; thick, protruding brows; rose-tinted sunglasses. Except now his face was slightly skewed, like the man in Edvard Munch’s The Scream with his mouth wired shut. He invited me over for tea. When we got inside Bono’s apartment (made entirely of marble, even the couch), Bono removed his sunglasses, revealing two eyes completely unaccustomed to  daylight. Set deep in his face, surrounded by uneven splotches of dark purple skin, his eyes looked like two raisins melted onto a topographical map of the Great Lakes. He looked over at his son — a 32-year-old petri dish clone — who was sitting at the kitchen table, miming a wrestling match between two jumbo shrimp in a bowl of cocktail sauce. ""Let me tell you a little story,"" he said, ""about love."" I looked at his shrunken voodoo eyes and tried to think of a polite escape, but it wasn’t as if I had anyone else to talk to.   Bono fucked up. He knew that now; now that his creation, in his own likeness no less — what he had hoped would be a vessel of altruism and goodness with a stomach for Jameson — was slouched over a Burrito Bomber tiki bar in an Orlando suburb wearing a muscle tee and a Hawaiian shirt (unbuttoned), snorting wet chunks of margarita salt off the hairy, sweat-soaked chest of a mall security guard named Robert. This creation was Bono’s son, his flesh, a few bits of his DNA soaked in chemicals and female ejaculate, birthed out of a petri dish in a medical complex outside of Fort Worth, Teaxas that specialized in sheep cloning. The customers at the McDonald’s next door often found tufts of genetically modified sheep fur in their Big Macs. The management told them it was onion skin. The thing was born on an unusually cold day in June, one of those days when the morning dew turns into morning frost and everyone talks about it at work.  I say he was born, but really I mean he was ripe. The scientists in the sheep lab heard a noise that morning; it was the sound of a plastic petri dish cracking against the clone’s baby-sized mass. Then, not a cry, but instead, the manic Texan ramblings of an adult who has never before experienced Earth. It was back in 1981 when Bono first started to feel irreparably lonely, right as he was spearheading the change of his band name from The Hype to U2. This loneliness coincided with an unquellable bout of egomania, and he decided the best way to cure his insufferable solitude was to recreate himself.  A man, Bono’s thinking went, is only as good as the things he puts into this world, and what better way to give back than to give the world another him? And so, in the spring of ‘81, he contacted a group of scientists he discovered through a sponsored tweet. They told Bono to take a mental fitness test and then send a sperm sample to their lab. It took years and millions of dollars, but it worked.  The clone’s name — a name Bono cultivated from a series of Encyclopedia Britannica about large oil conglomerates — was Horst Simco. He looked like Bono: that sharp, geometric jaw; that sloping, heavy brow; those tinted sunglasses. The doctors said somehow the sunglasses had become such a part of Bono that his clone was born with the same ones. In fact, (poor Horst), the glasses were fused to his face. The doctors said their removal would require dangerous skin grafting around the eye area, and so Bono refused the surgery, deciding that his son would have to make due. It was the first of Horst’s many struggles. Despite their artificial beginnings, Bono’s relationship with Horst was a perfect picture of father and son: hours-long games of catch lead to late dinners and even later movie nights. But in his teen years, Horst started staying out late with other neighborhood boys, self-medicating with mescaline, reckless driving, and Wü Tang albums in an attempt to forget that he was nothing but a clinic-born replica of his father. As a teenager, Horst developed a stutter. When he would ask for pepper, it would come out p-p-pe-pepper. When he asked for salt, his mouth became a hissing radiator. His birth name was even more of a challenge.  He would always get stuck on the ""or,"" which led many people to believe he was perpetually in the middle of making a decision. Because of this, Horst legally assumed a new moniker on his 18th birthday, one more suited to his own self-perception: Riff Raff.   When Riff Raff was 19, he left home and moved to Houston. He spent his nights competing in rap battles in grimy clubs and warehouses. He got the MTV and Nike logos tattooed on his chest. He bedazzled his sunglasses with hundreds of small pink Swarovski crystals. Bono and Riff Raff didn’t speak for three years, until they decided to reconnect, shortly after The Incident of 2025, on a Floridian vacation. (Though the spill had occurred in Toronto, its effects were felt across the globe. Within weeks, the water of Florida had turned purple. No one knew why, but some claimed to prefer the color to the original blue.) Florida is neutral ground, as the saying now goes. And that brings us back to the tiki bar. Against his better judgment, Bono had agreed to go with Riff Raff to the Burrito Bomber tiki bar near their peach-colored, cement-walled resort. They had been fighting all week: Bono wanted to go spelunking; Riff Raff wanted to go to a strip club. A trip to the tiki bar was their attempt at a compromise. After two hours in the bar, Bono realized he was beginning to enjoy the way his thighs were bloated with booze and the way the syrupy margarita lined his tongue like a shag carpet.  Riff Raff picked his head up from the mall security guard’s chest and looked down at his phone. Frozen margarita dribbled out of his mouth and onto the screen. ""Horst, your phone,"" Bono said, gesturing at the neon green ice on the iPhone. ""Don’t worry, it’s fake. It’s made of plastic, see?"" Riff Raff said, sleepily hitting the phone against the wooden bar. ""Some dude gave it to me in a Sports Authority."" By the time Bono and Riff left the tiki bar, their sweat was five parts lime margarita to one part salt, and the bartender had taken away their car keys. They would have to take a cab back to the resort. Luckily, a taxi was idling outside the bar. Bono and Riff exclaimed that it was like the cab had been waiting just for them. In reality, there were dozens of other cabs streaming down the block, waiting for tiki bar patrons who had overindulged. As Bono slid the yellow van door closed, the cab was illuminated by what, to Bono and Riff Raff, felt like several thousand disco balls lit by a vengeful member of the Guns N Roses stage crew. The driver turned around, his bald head caught in a ray of fuchsia. ""Welcome to Cash Cab!"" he bellowed, spit flying through the air like mist from a broken sprinkler. The driver-slash-game show host’s bloodshot eyes bulged, framed by one bead of sweat traveling slowly from his temple. He spoke in at a manic, hyperbolic speed: the United States boycotted the 1980 Summer Olympic Games in which city?   ""You understand?"" Bono said. I didn’t. Moscow, he whispered. Two weeks later, we spent the night in Drake’s studio because New Toronto Power and Light (NTPNL) was testing the radiation levels in our apartment (not that there was anything we could do about the results). The studio was nicer than the NPR offices, which, due to the exorbitant face mask funding, had no money left to supply its employees with chairs, garbage cans, or a water cooler. The hosts stood at their desks, surrounded by crushed Styrofoam coffee cups, snotty tissues, and Ira Glass’ Nutri-Grain Bar wrappers. He warned us frequently not to move their shiny pink carcasses, because it was art. Drake’s studio, on the other hand, was bright and spacious, with floor-to-ceiling windows looming over downtown New Toronto, exposed brick, delicate recessed lighting, and a stainless steel refrigerator brimming with Nutri-Grain bars. An Ira Glass dream. The wrappers were nestled snugly in wicker wastebaskets. An Ira Glass nightmare. We agreed to meet there late one night, because Drake was working late and because a fan had just brought him a case of Dom Perignon. In the elevator Drake commented on my peeling nose. ""You should take care of that."" ""I know, I got lotion."" For dinner, Drake and I went to a 24-hour deli, where we picked up two plastic containers of food — one Caesar salad and one potato salad with an inexplicable raisin topping. The news blared from a small television in the corner. A droopy-faced anchor, reading half-heartedly from a spiral notebook, was talking about the Olympics. No city was equipped to host this year. The cashier gave us the salads for free.",0.16327039075569322,0.8367296092443068,0.7096018357868576,2337,4.6418485237483953,1155,6.1047619047619044,0,8,"Culture, Entertainment, TL;DR"

Each will be made up of 14 acres — what Iger described as the largest single themed expansion in the company's history. The parks will each have two main attractions: one allows visitors to board the Millennium Falcon and fly what is described as a ""secret mission."" The other is a battle that puts visitors between the New Order and the Resistance from Star Wars: The Force Awakens. The parks will be populated by characters from the new movies as well as the classic Star Wars trilogy, and it sounds like quite a few fan favorites will be included. ""You'd expect to find a cantina,"" Iger said, ""and there will be one.""   Most notably, Iger name-checked Scott Trowbridge of Walt Disney Imagineering. We spoke with Trowbridge in 2013 after getting a look at the company's advanced sensor technologies and experiments in immersive, real-life experiences.

After seeing what ILMxLab has been working on — and hearing that team has a passion for theme park experiences — there's quite a few fascinating opportunities for how these attractions will go beyond your average ride. Star Wars has had a presence at Disney parks before, of course, most notably with the Star Tours ride. This is something entirely different, however: a completely immersive experience that lets visitors step into the land of a galaxy far, far away, where everything — including shop merchants — are in-character as part of the universe.

I've stopped reading, watching movies — it's weird! I probably have a few more weeks until my interest burns out, or my loved ones get worried enough to stage an intervention. The game is pretty simple. You're a blob, and you go around eating little pellets (""food"") and absorbing blobs smaller than you without getting absorbed by a larger blob. That absorbing usually happens by splitting in two, which lets you launch out half your mass and swallow any small enough blobs in front of you. There are also virus blobs that explode the bigger blobs, and if you hit ""w"" you'll eject your own pellets. It sounds complicated, but it makes sense pretty quickly once you start doing it. I've gotten really attached to the strategy of the game All of the blobs are directed by actual people somewhere on the internet, often with racist usernames. It's one of the more addictive games I've played, I think because it's effectively real-time (multiplayer waits for no man) and the graphics and gameplay are so simple that it's easy to lose yourself in it. But as I've spent more and more time in the game, I've gotten really attached to the strategy of it, and the deeper meaning behind that strategy. The decision to split your blob becomes a really profound decision: to grow bigger, you must first become smaller and more vulnerable. More size makes you harder to eat, but it also makes you slower and makes you more likely to be targeted. It feels like all of this should mean something, even if it's not clear what it actually means. A few competing theories: Agar.io as biology: The blobs are single-celled organisms absorbing ""food"" and dividing through self-triggered mitosis, with the individual players struggling to reenact the elemental formation of life as we know it. The green blob-splitters are officially known as ""viruses,"" which seems to support this theory. Agar.io as web sociology: Players will often play as ""Reddit"" or ""4chan,"" signaling their allegiance to a particular community but also suggesting the game as a microcosm of the internet at large. The blobs represent various sites and communities within the internet itself. Notice the game's resemblance to the Internet Map, in which sites like Google and Reddit grow by siphoning users and content (""mass,"" in the lingo of the game) from competing locations, eventually swallowing competitors whole. Agar.io as geopolitics: Players will also adopt the names, flags, and faces of world leaders like Barack Obama, Vladimir Putin, and Angela Merkel. So while the blobs can be microscopic cells or web properties, they can also represent entire nations, competing to swallow up the fruits of private-sector enterprise and civil society alike. Diplomacy just means staying out of range. Or maybe it's just a game about blobs?

The Runtastic Moment watch, like almost every other wrist-wearable with a certain combination of sensors, tracks steps, active minutes, calories burned and sleep cycles. But, unlike some others, it's waterproof up to 300 feet, which means it can be worn during swimming. It doesn't exactly track swimming yet - but in the future, Runtastic says, it may be able to track swim strokes. Another selling point for this style of activity-tracking watch is its battery life. Runtastic estimates that the watch should last for about 6 months on a standard coin battery. It pairs wirelessly over Bluetooth to share data with a Runtastic app for iPhone and Android. There are two price tiers for the Runtastic Moment. The ""Fun"" and ""Basic"" versions of the watch have a stainless steel case, a silicon strap and ship for $130, the only difference being that the unfortunately-named Basic has a slightly larger watch face. The Elite Moment and the Moment Classic both cost $180; the former ships with a black leather band, and the latter is available in silver, gold and rose gold casing.

Nor is the Runtastic Moment the only analog wristwatch that includes some element of activity-tracking and pairs wirelessly with a mobile app. The Withings Activite, a $450 Swiss-made watch, and Withings Pop, its less expensive non-Swiss counterpart, are both strikingly similar in design. Both the Runtastic Moment and the Withings models have round, clean-looking traditional watch faces, with smaller dials that indicate how much you've moved throughout the day.

For five years now, Apple has held a big event around September to announce the next iPhone — or, as in the past two years, the next iPhones. This year is no different. Apple is holding a major event on Wednesday, September 9th in one of the biggest San Francisco conference halls it's ever occupied. We're expecting two new iPhones, but the announcements won't stop there. This is going to be a big event. If the reports coming out of Cupertino are accurate, we may also be seeing a long-awaited refresh of the Apple TV, a bigger and more capable iPad, and even an updated iPad mini. For all of the details on what to expect — including which of these announcements are a lock and which are just maybes — we've put together a full preview of the event below. The event itself kicks off Wednesday, September 9th at 1PM ET / 10AM PT. As always, you'll be able to follow along with our live blog for immediate updates on Apple's announcements. Wednesday's main event will be two new iPhones: the iPhone 6S and the iPhone 6S Plus, as they'll almost certainly be named. As with prior ""S"" years, these two phones should maintain the same design that the iPhone already has, albeit with some minor tweaks. Most notably, both phones are expected to be ever so slightly thicker, according to analyst projections and leaked prototypes. That's for a few possible reasons, such as to make room for new components, to account for a change over to the tougher aluminum used in the Apple Watch Sport, or simply to strengthen areas prone to bending. The biggest new feature of the 6S and 6S Plus is expected to be pressure sensitivity, which Apple calls Force Touch. Force Touch was first introduced on the Apple Watch earlier this year, allowing the Watch's display to detect when pressure is being applied to it. It'll likely work much in the same way on the iPhone: when you press down on the screen, it'll be able to detect where you're pressing and how hard. Force Touch on the iPhone could be used to pull up new menus or perform specific actions. It might even allow the iPhone to duplicate the functions of a pressure sensitive stylus. More than likely, we'll have to wait for developers to figure out the most interesting uses for Force Touch — certainly, some games will be able to take advantage of it in clever ways. Read next: The iPhone 6S review. Oh, and one final note on Force Touch: according to 9to5Mac, the feature may end up being renamed for the iPhone. Its latest report says that ""3D Touch Display"" will likely be the branding, with the name referencing Apple's plan to have three types of touches used consistently throughout the operating system. That includes a tap, a press, and a deeper press. It sounds confusing, but it's possible that the phone will offer feedback to make the interactions more natural. Apple will also be giving these iPhones the usual spec bumps. That includes a new, faster processor and supposedly a jump up to 2GB of RAM — finally. The more interesting changes may be around the camera: the new iPhones are expected to have a 12-megapixel rear camera, rather than an 8-megapixel camera like the last four models, according to several reports. It's also expected to be able to shoot 4K video. There'll be a big change for both iPhones' front cameras, too. That camera is believed to be jumping up to a 5-megapixel sensor with an accompanying flash, which should result in some improved selfies. A flash and a 5-megapixel sensor are pretty standard features across other top smartphones at this point, and given how widely used that camera is for selfies, it's probably about time Apple caught up. So how will you let everyone know that you have the latest iPhone and not just an iPhone 6? It sounds like there'll be at least one way: Apple is said to start offering the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus in rose gold, matching the Apple Watch color. It'll just be aluminum — not actual gold — which means it's something you'll actually see around, and not just under Apple's display cases. There have also been some predictions that Touch ID will get a bit faster or more reliable on the new iPhones. Otherwise, that's it for the major changes. The phones are expected to keep their existing pricing and storage tiers, according to 9to5Mac, so the iPhone 6S should start at $199 for a 16GB model, and go up to $299 for the 64GB and $399 for the 128GB model; iPhone 6S Plus models should all be $100 extra. The iPhone 6 and iPhone 5S should each remain on sale, both having their prices cut by $100. That means the iPhone 5C will vanish — and there isn't expected to be a new iPhone 6C to take its place. Not yet, at least. It's been close to three years since the Apple TV was updated, so it's no exaggeration when we say that Wednesday's announcement is long overdue. Since its inception, the Apple TV has done a fine job of streaming movies and TV shows into the living room, but its capabilities stopped at that. Now, Apple is finally about to take the position beneath your TV seriously and let the Apple TV become a lot more powerful. The main way it's going to do that is with an app store. According to BuzzFeed News, Apple is planning to let developers start creating Apple TV apps, allowing them to put games, new video services, and other apps right on your TV. That alone will make the Apple TV far more capable. While we don't really know what — if anything — makes for a good TV app, games and new streaming services will quickly open up far more possibilities for the set-top box than it's had before. We're also expecting some big changes around how you navigate the Apple TV. Right now, the interface is just an endless grid of rectangles that you scroll through until you find the service you want. Worse, if you want to find a specific movie, you have to go look for it in every service you have until you find it. The new Apple TV is supposed to solve that. The main way is with Siri and a universal search, according to BuzzFeed News. Rather than typing out the name of a movie, you should just be able to speak it to Siri and have the Apple TV show you which services are streaming it. And that's it. Done. It's not a unique feature — Amazon introduced something like this over a year ago, for instance — but it's going to be extremely helpful. The interface itself is also expected to get some sort of design overhaul. It's not clear if that'll just be stylistic or if it'll go deeper and actually make the system's menus more intuitive, but the latter would certainly be preferred. The good news is that the way you navigate the Apple TV is supposed to change big time. For the most part, that's thanks to a fancy new remote with Siri built in. You'll just hit a button and speak into the remote, and that'll be what activates the universal search feature mentioned above. The remote is also supposed to have a swipeable touchpad, which will hopefully make moving around the Apple TV's endless menus a bit quicker. It may also be helpful for gaming — the remote is supposed to double as a basic game controller, according to 9to5Mac, with it even having motion sensitivity built in just like an iPhone. Other than that, you can probably expect it to maintain some sort of home or menu button and a play / pause button. It's been widely reported that Apple eventually wants to offer its own streaming TV service. Unfortunately, that's not going to start next week. Or even necessarily this year, as Recode previously reported. Content deals aren't easy to make, and content providers are likely hesitant to work with a behemoth like Apple, which can turn an industry inside out. Instead, Apple seems to be interested in getting Apple TVs next to as many television sets as it can, so that when the service is ready, plenty of people will be able to sign up. That hardly means that there won't be anything to watch, however. If you're a cable subscriber — or you know the password of someone who is a cable subscriber — you should be able to stream TV from a number of major networks. There'll also still be all of the apps you expect, like Netflix and Hulu, and likely a whole lot more once app developers get to work. The Apple TV box itself is believed to be getting a bit slimmer on the outside. On the inside, it should be much more powerful, too. According to 9to5Mac and BuzzFeed News, it's expected to receive some version of the A8 processor that's currently in the iPhone 6, and it'll include either 8GB or 16GB of storage (we'd obviously love to see the latter, but never count on Apple to be generous with storage). Pricing is reported to start at $149, and it wouldn't be surprising to see models with additional storage sell for a premium. The only big downside that's been reported about the new Apple TV so far is that it isn't believed to support 4K video, according to 9to5Mac. That isn't a problem if you only plan on keeping it for a couple years, but 4K TVs are making their way into the market in a big way. If you're buying a TV soon, there's a good chance you'll be going 4K, and this model of the Apple TV won't be ready for that. For most people, that's not going to be a problem — there isn't much to watch in 4K yet anyway — but it's worth keeping in mind. For about a year now, word has been going around that Apple is working on a larger iPad. Apple supposedly wants the new iPad in stores by the end of this year, and that means it could see an announcement on Wednesday, according to 9to5Mac. Its announcement isn't a sure thing, but if we don't hear about it this month, we'll almost certainly hear about it next. There's no guarantee that the bigger iPad will be called the iPad Pro, either; but the name fits with Apple's existing naming schemes, so we're running with it until Apple says otherwise. Don't just think bigger tablet. Think: ""this is basically the size of a laptop."" The iPad Pro is expected to include a 12.9-inch display — for context, the new MacBook has a 12-inch display, and the MacBook Pro starts with a 13.3-inch display. This is going to be one big iPad. Expect that display to be every bit as sharp as the iPad Air's, too. This is almost certainly going to be a high-end tablet. The iPad Pro is almost certainly going to be as powerful — and very likely more powerful — than the current top-of-the-line iPad. Chances are, this new iPad will get filled with the same general specs as the new iPhones, including an A9 processor and 2GB of RAM. If Apple really is designing this iPad for the office, than it might make sense to see extra connectivity features — be it additional ports or wireless systems like NFC, as AppleInsider has reported — to let the tablet do a bit more. Steve Jobs famously derided the stylus when introducing the first iPad. But times have changed, and so have touchscreens. At least one analyst — and a reliable one, at that — has been guessing that Apple will sell a stylus alongside the iPad Pro. And as of Friday, 9to5Mac was reporting that a stylus may actually ship with the iPad Pro. Either way, Apple creating a stylus in would mark a big shift in how it sees the iPad being used. There's a good chance that the iPad Pro will use the same Force Touch technology as the Apple Watch (and soon the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus) in order to let its users get more done. Combined with the tablet's big size, a stylus could make this iPad into an excellent tool for creating art. It's possible that pressure sensitivity will make the iPad better for note-taking, too, which may finally make the iPad a viable alternative to a notepad when walking into class or a meeting. 9to5Mac also reports that Apple is working on a keyboard accessory for the iPad; it sounds like the keyboard won't be included, but — like the Surface — it's possible that it'll be a must-have accessory. Between that and a stylus, Apple should be able to set the iPad Pro apart from the iPad Air in a real way. Every time Apple introduces a new screen size, it adds some new features into iOS to take advantage of the difference. That'll likely be no different here, even if the changes are small. 9to5Mac reports that some changes are expected in how Siri and Notification Center are presented. One big feature that we're certain to see is multitasking. Apple is introducing true multitasking with iOS 9, and it's sure to play a prominent role here. With a screen that big, perhaps the iPad Pro will even be able to handle more than two apps at a time. The iPad Pro is by far the upcoming Apple product that we know about the least. It's easy to guess at what's in a bigger iPad, but it looks like we're going to have to wait for Apple to explain what extra software features are in it — not to mention why you'd actually want to buy this thing. According to 9to5Mac, even if the iPad Pro is announced on Wednesday, it likely won't ship until November. That'll give you plenty of time to decide if you really need one. That's right: we may see two new iPads on Wednesday. If 9to5Mac is right that Apple is introducing iPads at this event, then we're expecting to see a new version of the iPad mini, too. Last year, it was left behind when the iPad Air received a spec bump, and it looks like the mini is now finally due to receive an upgrade of its own, putting the small tablet on par with the iPad Air 2. The iPad mini 4 is supposed to take after the iPad Air in one other way: design. Though they already look a lot alike, the mini is supposed to shrink down even more to match the size of its bigger sibling. That means an even thinner and more portable tablet — basically, it's shaping up to be the iPad mini we wanted to see last year but never got. Oddly enough, there hasn't been any word about an iPad Air 3. The iPad Air 2 came out about 10 months ago, so an update is due in the near future, but it's possible that Apple is changing up its plans. With the arrival of the iPad Pro, Apple may want to put more of an ability gap between its tablet lines, and one way to do that is by making one of them cool off for a year. Another effect of that decision: producing the iPad Air would get a bit cheaper, which is something that Apple could definitely use. The Apple Watch was first announced this month last year, but it wasn't actually released until this April. That means Apple's smartwatch isn't anywhere near due for an update, and it isn't likely that Apple will tease details that early again, either. But 9to5Mac reports that Apple may still have something to share: new color options for the Apple Watch's sport bands. A bit more variety is something the bands could definitely use… especially since, I dunno, maybe everyone isn't into pastels? Apple has likely already announced iOS 9's biggest features, but there's one big thing we don't know about it: when it's coming out. As usual, the new version of iOS will ship with the new iPhone, and that means it'll likely be pushed out to the public a few days beforehand. Expect Apple to give a release date for iOS 9 sometime in mid-September. As for OS X El Capitan, you'll probably have to wait until October, if history is any indication.

Roll the wholesome family video: Where to even begin. Well, to start with, the mighty Philips corporation repeatedly refers to your loving child as ""it"" while comparing toothpaste to what every kid loves: peas. Next we see that its $49.99 Bluetooth toothbrush requires an iPad, the cheapest of which costs $299. Finally, it becomes clear that there's no way for the so-called ""smart"" toothbrush to know if it’s actually inside your child’s mouth. So, for all that expensive technology required to make it work, you’ll still have to stand there like most parents to ensure your child is brushing effectively.  No worries, I’m sure Philips will soon offer a remote monitoring kit that can be viewed from $700 smartphones. Don’t be stupid, be smart and buy your kid one of those $2 egg timers with suction cups instead. Then you can splurge on a luxurious $3 toothbrush and put the remaining $345 towards educating your child about the idiocy of the Internet of Things. A year ago, I was here at IFA in a state of exasperation. Every electronics company was throwing a diversity of awkward smartwatches at the wall and waiting to see what sticks. Nothing did, because they were all too big, unwieldy, and compromised. This year, though, Samsung has launched a volley so powerful and immediately convincing that it might just break the wall down entirely. I’ve just worn the first smartwatch that I would actually consider buying. Monster unveiled a selfie case at IFA in Berlin this morning as if it was a new product. The company actually launched it a few months ago, but that didn't stop it from claiming it was the biggest announcement at IFA. Monster hyped up its selfie case as if it had solved some type of problem that regular selfies and selfie-sticks can’t solve, but during a presentation it was nothing but a monster fail. A demo left an iPhone tumbling towards the floor as the selfie case failed to stick to a TV properly. Apple's new donut-shaped campus will house 13,000 employees scattered about a mind-boggling 2.8 million square feet, a nearly 230 percent bump over the company's current HQ at 1 Infinite Loop. And that doesn't include the 1,000-seat auditorium, nor the 300,000 square feet dedicated solely to R&D facilities. To help you conceptualize a facility of that magnitude, drone pilot and photographer Duncan Sinfield has released a video showing an aerial view of the site under construction.

Good has always had a bit more of a multi-platform focus than BlackBerry, so the move should help the company shore up its ability to help big companies manage the devices their employees use. It also probably doesn't hurt to mention that Good has a pretty strong suite of Android device management software — and everybody's expecting BlackBerry to begin releasing Android devices itself in the very near future. The acquisition will cost BlackBerry $425 million in cash. BlackBerry thinks that it'll close the deal by the end of November and start making money from Good's business right away, to the tune of $160 million in revenue in the first year. Although Good and BlackBerry have platforms that slightly overlap, CEO John Chen isn't too worried about that, and said on a conference call today that ""It is our plan to go to one, unified platform,"" although he declined to pin down any specifics on when that might happen. That's the relatively dry business story — but it doesn't cover the amusing history of Good and BlackBerry. The two companies have sparred publicly in the past. BlackBerry used to love to mark up Good's press releases with catty annotations pointing out where it believed Good was wrong. Here's one, and here's another:   Mean. Good Technology has also had a convoluted past. It was briefly owned by Motorola Mobility, who bought it in 2006 to try to compete with BlackBerry for push email. I used it myself back then, it was one of the better solutions for Windows Mobile back in the days before Microsoft figured out that maybe it would be a good idea for Exchange to support mobile devices directly. Motorola sold Good off in 2009, and the company was doing much more than just push email by then, creating a suite of device management products. While the sniping between BlackBerry and Good is fun, it's not my favorite part of Good Technology's history. No, as an Old and a Nerd, my favorite part is pointing out that Good Technology got its start creating an MP3 expansion module for the Handspring Visor PDA back in 2000. The Visor was the predecessor to the Treo smartphone.   In other words, Good Technology was there at the beginning of the smartphone revolution, which before the iPhone meant glomming on features on top of PDAs.

There's always a screen or viewfinder blocking your view, and in the end you never wind up in the photos that you're taking. You never get to be a participant in the moments that you're documenting. At least that's the way James Malcolm, the president of Ricoh America, sees it, and it's the thinking behind the Theta S — a $349 360-degree photo and video camera that's supposed to let you relive moments you capture without excluding you from the scene. Malcolm's claim wasn't all talk. I took a few photos with the Theta S at its unveiling yesterday, and it wasn't until I pinched and zoomed around all 360 degrees of one photo before I saw there was a woman performing aerial acrobatics just a few feet behind and above my head.  Two years ago, Ricoh found a way to produce full, spherical photos and videos without needing a 16-camera array or a ball with a bunch of lenses on it. It was a small, Apple TV remote-sized camera called the Theta. The problem was the quality was awful. Too much had been sacrificed for the sake of portability and ease of use. The Theta S is a much more competent version of its predecessor. It's capable of higher resolutions, has more internal storage (8GB as opposed to 4GB), and it comes in a more professionally polished design. Each of the two 12-megapixel cameras on the Theta S has a 190-degree field of view, so the images being recorded actually overlap. This helps the software stitch the images together more smoothly and also removes the camera from the finished photo or video, which means you can always be in the shot. And those finished products look great, by the way. Ricoh couldn't have picked a more challenging venue to show off its new product; we were in Manhattan's Diamond Horseshoe Theater, a below-street-level dinner theater joint with a burlesque show vibe (hence, the aerial acrobatics). But the 360-degree photos were still relatively free of image noise and full of detail, likely thanks in part to the f2.0 lens on each side, which produces even greater quality photos and videos in broad daylight. The Theta S is also dead simple to use. The camera only has four buttons: one to turn it on, one to activate the camera's Wi-Fi, one to switch between photo and video modes, and one to record. It reminds me a lot, both in shape and simplicity, of the Flip camera, the ""video camera for the masses"" before GoPro actually became the video camera for the masses. The photos and videos you shoot with the Theta S can be downloaded to your phone with just one tap in the Theta app. The app also gives you an interactive live view of what the camera is seeing, so you can get a really good sense of what your 360-degree scene will look like in the end. It's a small but important feature, because very few people are familiar with the idea with how, why, or even when to shoot 360-degree images. When you're done shooting, you can post your spherical images to Ricoh's dedicated website for the Theta and share them on various social media, try to get them published on Google Maps as ""Photo Spheres,"" or — if you shot video — upload right to YouTube, which has allowed interactive spherical video playback since March. (That last one is a big deal, because finding the right home for spherical content has been one of the biggest limitations of 360-degree cameras so far.) Of course, there are a handful of caveats, including the $349 price tag. The Theta S has its limits when it comes to video, which looks good but is not quite as impressive as the pictures the camera creates. And as for live streaming, Malcolm admitted that it will take a while for a full-featured mode to come to the Theta S. (Right now it only works if the camera is plugged in with an HDMI cable.) The unveiling event itself even had to be structured around the limitations of the device. It started with a Theta S dangling from the ceiling above a Cyr wheel performance, but neither Malcolm nor his team were able to access that footage wirelessly. Instead, they had to manually retrieve the camera, bring it backstage, and by the end of the hour-long presentation the video was finally shown to the audience. The Ricoh Theta S will be available in the US, Asia, and Europe in October for $349.",0.4311987298826474,0.5688012701173526,0.17392115019251608,784,4.5612244897959187,396,5.7297979797979801,0,26,"Photography, Tech, Hands-on, Photo Essay"
