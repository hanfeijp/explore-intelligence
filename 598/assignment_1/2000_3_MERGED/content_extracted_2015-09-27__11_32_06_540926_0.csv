With Apple, it was Steve Jobs being fired and coming back years later to lead the company to fortune. For Microsoft co-founders Bill Gates and Paul Allen, it was a failed business that crunched traffic data into reports for transit engineers. And for GoPro, it took one failed startup attempt and multiple wipeouts face-first into the ocean. GoPro was born out of necessity Unlike so many great inventions that have happened by mistake, GoPro was born out of necessity. Fresh from Funbug, a failed gaming and marketing startup, GoPro founder Nick Woodman did what any self-respecting entrepreneur would do, and went on a surfing trip halfway across the world. He was enamored with taking pictures, and as a side project, jury-rigged a waterproof camera that could be strapped around his wrist with a surfboard leash. But those cameras couldn't take a beating when Woodman wiped out, which was often. He eventually came to the realization it might be better to focus on making the cameras himself. With some borrowed money from his parents, and lots of testing, he built the first prototype of the GoPro in 2004. Now a decade — and many models — later, the company is going public with the hopes that it's left the face-plants in the past. That $100 million could go up substantially In a filing today, the company said it plans to raise $100 million from its initial public offering, and will list on the NASDAQ exchange under the ticker symbol GPRO. That number sets a baseline, and may increase substantially depending on investor interest GoPro encounters during its roadshow leading up to the IPO. Along with the IPO figure, the company disclosed its financials, saying that it earned $60.6 million in profit off revenues close to $1 billion last year. It also said that nearly half its sales came from outside the US last year, a percentage that's already beyond beyond the halfway mark so far, this year. GoPro also detailed a dual class plan for its common stock, giving voting control to Woodman and other executives. That means the group that founded and directed the company early on will hold the reins as it evolves, something that's been a key factor in the long term growth and evolution at companies like Google and Facebook. While GoPro's main product is cameras, the company sells a dizzying selection of mounts and accessories that take it beyond what you get out of the box. In fact, it's one of the big things that's helped make it stand out from competitors. You can stick one of the company's cameras anywhere, be it on your wrist, head, chest, or on surfboards, cars, bikes, or anything flat enough to handle a suction cup. GoPro also sells hardware add-ons, like wireless remote controls, external video screens, and power packs. Cameras are just the start In a world filled with inexpensive smartphones that get bigger screens and better cameras every few months, there is the very real question of how GoPro can not only survive, but continue to flourish, something investors will expect to be addressed. In an interview with Forbes last year, Woodman said he views GoPro as having an edge in durability and utility. More recently, he's argued that both GoPro and smartphones are eating away at traditional point-and-shoot cameras, and earning more space on store shelves as a result. Even so, in its filing, GoPro admitted that smartphones, tablets, and the companies making them could create hardened versions of their own products, becoming a very real threat. ""Smartphones and tablets with photo and video functionality have significantly displaced traditional camera sales,"" the company notes. ""It is possible that, in the future, the manufacturers of these devices, such as Apple Inc. and Samsung, may design them for use in a range of conditions, including challenging physical environments, or develop products similar to ours."" Even so, the GoPro has managed to flourish at a time when smartphones have seen some of their biggest sales. Sales of GoPro have soared, more than doubling each year since the first model launched. All told, it's sold 8.5 million HD cameras since 2009, with 3.8 million of those being sold just last year. In 2011, the company racked up $234.2 million in revenue, followed a year later with $526 million. In an interview with Forbes, Woodman originally said he expected last year's sales to double, though it fell just shy of that with $985.7 million.  Others haven't come close. According to IDC, GoPro had a 30.4 percent share of digital camcorders last year. That's higher than Sony, Panasonic, and Canon — companies that helped created that entire digital camcorder category, and that sell more than just action cameras. In the ruggedized camcorder category, GoPro accounted for 77 percent of the market last year, and have been the top brand in standalone video cameras for the past five quarters, according to the NPD group. ""I don't see anyone effectively competing with them because focusing on the quality of the hardware is missing the point,"" says Stephen Baker, a VP of industry analysis for the NPD Group. ""Go Pro wins because of its ecosystem, because people want to be associated with the brand.  It is about lifestyle and not hardware — which is a good thing."" GoPro cameras are available just about anywhere these days, but that wasn't always the case. Woodman originally began selling cameras out of a Volkswagen bus, and later at trade shows. GoPro's big break came once it got on store shelves, beginning with deals to get cameras inside REI and Best Buy. In 2011, GoPro caught the attention of five venture firms that, led by Steamboat Ventures, put $88 million into the company. A year later, Foxconn — a company more well-known for assembling electronics for Apple and others — bought an 8.88 percent stake in GoPro for $200 million, valuing GoPro at $2.25 billion. That particular deal was described as strategic by both companies, with Foxconn getting access to GoPro's imaging technologies, and GoPro having more direct access to Foxconn's massive manufacturing empire. GoPro's success has created plenty of competitors GoPro's success has spurred no shortage of competitors, including me-too products from existing tech giants. Sony, which made a pocket camera called the Bloggie, switched gears with the smaller, mountable Action Cam in 2012. The same year, JVC launched the Adixxion, a diminutive waterproof action camera with built-in Wi-Fi and a screen on the back. Last year, Panasonic even tried its hand with a camera that can snake around your ear. There have also been a handful of action-camera upstarts like Ion, Veho, Geonaute, and Drift, all of whom are intent on getting a piece of the growing pie. But others have not been so lucky. Contour, a Seattle-based startup, began around the same time as GoPro and with a similar aim. Instead of surfing, co-founders Marc Barros and Jason Green created the lipstick-style action camera to stick on to ski helmets. The company grew briskly, but ultimately couldn't keep up with GoPro, and closed up shop last August to the surprise of some of its employees. Contour investor Clarke Capital ultimately ended up buying the company's assets, and continues to sell existing camera models. Similar fears of staying power surround GoPro, despite stellar sales. There is a very real question of just how it plans to keep its momentum going, and whether that involves expanding into new areas. The earliest peek into that plan would seem to suggest that GoPro is determined to evolve beyond its status as a hardware maker, and move towards being a media company, piggybacking on the viral nature of the videos its users create and share. So far, that includes a curated channel on Microsoft's Xbox consoles, which launched on the Xbox 360 last month and is headed to the Xbox One later. That's on top of similar curated channels on YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook. For GoPro, the payoffs have been huge, and transformative in terms of documenting what's happening in the world. Like Russian dashboard cams that captured the Chelyabinsk meteor from just about every angle when it struck the Earth last year, GoPro has allowed the entire world to experience the thrill of extreme sports through the eyes of the daredevil athletes who risk their necks. What began as a mostly surfing-oriented device has quickly expanded to rock climbing, racecar driving, and everyday backyard hijinks. And all that relatively mundane footage means that occasionally something more exciting breaks out and goes viral, further adding to GoPro's cachet. Pigs help sell cameras too Case in point: a video that blew up in early February featuring a duo of skydivers. The clip starts with the pair of skydivers inside a plane high above Northern California, one of whom flashes the camera a sly middle finger. Seconds later, and without warning, the camera goes tumbling out of the plane, spinning so fast viewers are treated to a dizzying free fall. The camera ultimately lands in a pig pen, where it's nearly eaten by one of the inhabitants, but manages to keep rolling footage unscathed.  GoPro has used clips like this to promote its products in advertisements on various social networks. It's also pulled out all the stops when it comes to showing off the products in stores and to the press. The company's designed specialty kiosks with video footage that shows the product in action as well as its results. It's taken a similarly unorthodox approach pitching the product to the media, inviting around 60 journalists to test out its third-generation Hero camera on their choice of land, sea, or air: activities involved motorcycles, scuba diving with sharks, skydiving from hot air balloons, or riding shotgun in Czech military jets. Lifestyle imagery is a clear part of GoPro's business And now, as it aims to go public, lifestyle imagery and the aspiration to obtain it are becoming a clearer part of its business. Last October, GoPro inked a deal with Virgin America to show videos shot on its cameras to passengers. In January, that was joined with the aforementioned plans to launch a GoPro channel on Microsoft's Xbox console, where players can even buy cameras and accessories straight from their couch. And according to GoPro, the company plans to start making money off those partnerships with advertising and sponsorships this very quarter. In that sense, for GoPro now — and possibly well into the future — hardware is not everything. Competitors are catching up with, and even surpassing, GoPro with cameras that have more features at a lower price. There are also Sony and Samsung, which have begun hardening their smartphones to survive dunks in water and spills onto pavement, a trend that could very well spread to other manufacturers and shorten the durability divide Woodman preaches. If that ends up being the case, the one thing that's likely to separate GoPro from the pack is its brand. In just 10 years, it's become synonymous with the very activities it's been designed to chronicle — even if those are face plants into the ocean. ""Anybody can build hardened smartphones, sell head mounts or build a waterproof device, but they still cant be a GoPro,"" Baker says. ""Of course it remains to be seen if this can be effective in the long run.""

Take four or more circles of the same color and connect them to make a square. The app was created in the spring of 2013 by Patrick Moberg and Paul Murphy as part of a Hackers in Residence program at Betaworks, a four month development session meant to create new projects and see which ideas are worth pursuing. From those humble beginnings the game has gone on to be a worldwide sensation, hitting the top of the charts in over 20 countries. But in the world’s biggest mobile market, China, Dots hasn’t had an impact at all. While copycat games have been raking in the cash, Dots was basically ignored by Chinese consumers. ""It’s much bigger than North America, yet makes up less than 1 percent of our install base,"" said Dots CEO Paul Murphy. And so today the company is trying to succeed where so many companies, from Zynga to King, the maker of Candy Crush, have failed. It’s launching a Chinese version of its game and it's bringing on a big partner, arguably the biggest, in Alibaba, the Chinese web giant with more sales than Amazon and eBay combined. American apps are increasingly looking to China Kelland Willis, a Forrester analyst focused on China, says Dots' decision to attack the Chinese market highlights a much bigger shift among American tech companies. ""I would say that there are definitely more American apps as a whole looking to expand into China today, driven by the massive mobile market in China, the ease of scaling digital products today and likely reaching saturation in the US,"" says Willis. ""The difference between now and five years ago is massive."" ""China represents a massive business opportunity, one that a lot of tech companies can’t resist,"" says Eric Jackson, managing partner at Ironfire Capital, a technology-focused fund that has invested in both US and Chinese gaming companies. The region has three times the paying customers of the next-largest sector, North America, and the highest ratio of players who pay, at 47 percent. China’s mobile-gaming market is projected to equal or surpass the US in gross sales with $3.2 billion this year. It’s no wonder app developers are drooling at the idea of entering China, but Jackson warns it's not as simple as translating a few phrases or tweaking the design. ""There are a lot of dead bodies left behind by American consumer companies that thought they could go into China and keep doing things the way they always did,"" says Jackson. eBay, Amazon, Facebook, Google, and Twitter have all tried their hands at the Chinese market and been crushed handily by local competition and a political climate that favors local incumbents. Crush maker King failed for years to get traction, prompting it to call a do-over last month. ""If you’re going to take on three or four native copycats that understand how to talk to consumers, you’re going to need some local help,"" says Jackson. There is a long list of American companies that flopped in ChinaDots learned this lesson before launch and today it’s debuting in China with the help of Alibaba, the world’s largest e-commerce company and a titan of the Chinese internet. ""They were in the process of launching their gaming platform, and had recently recruited all-stars from the gaming world that offered to advise us,"" says Murphy, Dots’ CEO. ""They also happen to have a massive audience of hundreds of millions of daily users."" A lot of mobile consumers in China don’t download their apps from the stores run by Google or Apple, but from homegrown app stores instead. Dots will be featured in Alibaba’s Taobao store. It’s the same trick Candy Crush is trying this time around by partnering with Tencent. Another challenge for apps launching in China is getting connected with local infrastructure to assure speed and quality on the backend. Big service providers like Amazon, Rackspace, and Google aren’t available in mainland China. In-app payments are another challenge, as many Chinese consumers don’t use Paypal, Apple, or Google to make their mobile purchases. Alibaba solved all that in one stroke for Dots. ""We're hosting our backend on Alicloud, their equivalent of Amazon Web Services,"" says Murphy. ""And we’re using their ubiquitous payment platform, Alipay, for payments."" There is little stigma around bootleg versionsThe second part is crucial, as most Chinese consumers won't make in-game purchases unless the process is trusted and seamless, says Willis, the Forrester analyst focused on China. ""Even on official computer systems, the majority of the software is bootleg. The culture there has trained them to expect software to be free, and they don’t see any stigma in owning a counterfeit handbag or a bootleg app."" The genuine, article, in other words, has to be much better than the copycats, and priced within reach. While China has more mobile gamers than anywhere else, individual consumers mostly aren’t willing to pay the same prices as their American and European counterparts. Dots reduced their lowest price items from $1 to roughly 30 cents for in-app purchases. To make it up they will need a big audience, and unlike in the US, that’s not on iOS. ""It's a scale game, and most of the scale is on Android,"" says Murphy. The scale, and sales, are on Android in ChinaOf course Android, in China more than elsewhere, has its challenges. ""The Android device market is even more heavily fragmented there,"" says Murphy. ""The top five devices in China each only have about 2 percent market share. And one of the most popular Android device makers, Xiaomi, isn't even available in the US. We had to call in a favor from a friend to get a few to take home with us."" The final challenge was cultural. Dots decided to change the name. ""We came up with 点点, pronounced dian dian which doesn't directly translate, but is a more affectionate way to say 'dots', like calling a dog a puppy,"" says Murphy. The team created a new tutorial and handled all the translation themselves, relying on three employees who luckily speak Chinese. ""A lot of the changes are subtle like the tutorials, trophies, and in-app purchase mechanics,"" says Murphy. All told, he thinks of 点点 as a new app in it own right. ""You would definitely notice that they are related. Fraternal twins, not identical ones.""",0.5280158537749853,0.4719841462250147,0.8817181452369726,1081,4.9491211840888063,564,6.1471631205673756,0,0,"Business, Culture, Gaming, Mobile, Tech, Report",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

The fact that Wi-Fi will allow residents to connect phones and tablets should also be a big help, as those devices can be far less expensive than a traditional computer. Even with Wi-Fi, internet access will still not be widely accessible.

In 2009, the bureau began gathering communications for its own purposes and began adding new email accounts and phone numbers to monitor through the NSA's upstream data collection program.

The Personal Data Notification and Protection Act would demand that hacked American companies inform customers within 30 days if their data has been stolen, while the Student Data Privacy Act would stop tech firms from profiting from information collected from digital education products (e.g. tablets used in the classroom or online homework portals). Obama's focus on digital issues follows a year of high-profile hacks Obama is expected to announce these schemes in full during a visit today to the Federal Trade Commission reports The New York Times. The president will be highlighting cybersecurity and privacy issues as key topics ahead of his State of the Union address on January 20th. The focus on digital issues follows a year of high-profile cases including massive hacks on companies such as Sony and Target and a running battle between telecoms, tech companies, and consumers for control over the internet. ""As cybersecurity threats and identity theft continue to rise, recent polls show that 9 in 10 Americans feel they have in some way lost control of their personal information — and that can lead to less interaction with technology, less innovation, and a less productive economy,"" said a White House briefing document seen by the Times. Proposed laws would see the discovery of a data breach trigger a ""30-day shot clock"" for companies to inform affected customers. Additional voluntary legislation would protect home energy data and create an ""early warning system"" for identity theft. The Times also notes that new laws will make it a crime to sell ""cyberinformation"" belonging to US citizens overseas. In a separate speech in Iowa on Wednesday, Obama is expected to address the issue of internet access, pitching new initiatives to roll out affordable, high-speed broadband across the country. Some commentators are also predicting that the president will use his upcoming State of the Union address to reiterate calls to reclassify the internet as a utility. In a speech in November last year, the president asked the Federal Communications Commission to introduce stronger legislation stopping telecom companies from creating a tiered system of internet access. Although Obama has no direct control over internet legislation, his influential State of the Union address is scheduled to take place a little more than a month before the FCC votes on new proposals on February 26th. Update 12:50PM ET: The White House has published a fact sheet confirming the report. Besides the two bills, it includes news about various private-sector consumer protection agreements. The Personal Data Notification and Protection Act is accompanied by expanded options for seeing free credit scores, and the Student Digital Privacy Act appears alongside an announcement that 75 education-related companies have signed a ""student privacy pledge."" This appears to be an agreement that was first introduced late last year, requiring signatories to refrain from selling student data, provide clear notice of privacy policy changes, and limit data retention, among other things.",0.6126708432505585,0.38732915674944146,0.8919123669035428,501,5.3872255489021956,301,6.3255813953488369,0,0,"Policy & Law, Tech, US & World",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

""We’ve got to get something in place that allows both industry and government to work more closely together,"" an unnamed White House source told The Washington Post. Those indicators of cyber threats would immediately be shared with other government agencies like the FBI, NSA, and Secret Service, as well as private-sector Information Sharing and Analysis Organizations (ISAOs). But Obama's latest package — which comes after the massive hack against Sony Pictures Entertainment and earlier attacks directed at major US retailers — contains many other provisions designed to heighten cybersecurity. Companies would be shielded against lawsuits for sharing attack details It will allow for the prosecution of people found to be selling or renting out the botnets (often used in distributed denial of service attacks) and authorize courts to shut them down if criminal activity is detected. Obama's legislation would also make illegal the overseas sale of stolen US financial data, such as the personal information that spread across the web like wildfire after the Home Depot hack. It would not permit private sector companies to retaliate against hackers, though. According to Politico, Homeland Security and the Attorney General will also ""develop guidelines for the receipt, retention, use and disclosure of cyber threat data within the federal government"" under the legislation. That last part is of particular interest to the Electronic Frontier Foundation; wary of the intelligence community's snooping tendencies, the EFF wants to ensure that private details aren't carelessly exchanged between government agencies like DHS and the NSA. ""DHS needs to take an active lead role in ensuring that unnecessary personal information is not shared with intelligence authorities,"" a spokesperson told The Washington Post. Obama's plan must somehow pass through Congress first Privacy advocates are also concerned with the legal immunity granted to private sector companies being overly broad — especially if they end up needlessly disclosing sensitive, personal information. But the White House says that won't be a problem, noting that companies will need to stick closely to privacy restrictions like ""removing unnecessary personal information"" and carefully safeguarding the data necessary to qualify for the lawsuit protection. More often than not, the information being exchanged between private companies and the government will pertain to the method of attack, not the content that hackers are after, according to the administration. Obama's latest attempt to ramp up US cybersecurity efforts also includes two proposals introduced Monday: forbidding companies from selling student data and urging hacked businesses to notify consumers of a cyber attack within 30 days. With a Republican-controlled Congress, Obama may face long odds in passing this package of proposals, but he'll be meeting with GOP leaders in an attempt to find common legislative ground this week. Obama will outline the full vision of his plan during a visit to the Department of Homeland Security today at 3PM.",0.5203826488098656,0.4796173511901344,0.8445796617448885,506,5.6363636363636367,309,6.5372168284789645,0,0,"Policy & Law, US & World",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

Still, I spent 90 minutes watching Microsoft’s E3 event last night after I put the kids to bed. Not because I wanted to, but because it’s my job. What I didn’t expect was to fall in love with a game at the 52-minute mark.  “Hi I’m Chad from Studio MDHR, and this is my brother Jared. A few years ago when we first sat down to sketch Cuphead, we had no idea that character would eventually be the star of his own Xbox game.” Cue the trailer:  I watched, mouth agape, mind empty but for a single Keanuism: Whoa. The watercolor backgrounds. The original jazz composition that sounds like The Shadow giving chase through pre-Castro Havana. The hand-drawn and hand-inked cell animation reminiscent of Walt’s early Disney — aka, the Golden Age of Animation. I had to stop the broadcast and watch it again, combing through the 60-second clip like Abraham Zapruder. I discovered ACME-branded detritus. Baby birds weaponized with 10 penny nails affixed by rubber bands. A suitcase-wielding worker bee trudging through the daily grind. What looks like Bluto from Popeye and some kind of fish-head propeller boss in boxing gloves. As a game, Cuphead bills itself as an all action all the time run and gun, coming to Xbox One and Steam (PC) sometime in 2016. But it’s also a wonderful homage to 1930s animation.  Cuphead employs the ""plausible impossible,"" a technique that Disney used to give life to inanimate objects in shorts like Thru the Mirror (above) from 1936. Similarly, everything is alive in the world of Cuphead: anthropomorphized ships, barrels, a giant angry carrot, and a slot machine dispensing studded rock-n-roll bracelets of Nilay’s doom. Frenetic objects in constant movement like a bouncing Steamboat Willie. Roger Ebert famously proclaimed that video games can never be art. Like Ebert, I’m not experienced enough with the medium to exalt such an axiom. But I only have to watch this Cuphead trailer to know that great art can be used to create video games.

Sony has a similar deal in place for Destiny In an age where true platform-exclusive games are few and far between, Sony and Microsoft have secured DLC deals with other publishers to differentiate between the PlayStation and Xbox versions of new games. By stumping up undisclosed sums of cash, the platform holders have been able to get new exclusive maps, special weapons, and early beta access, tempting passionate and impatient fans to their side with minor additions to the biggest games. And none have traditionally come bigger than Call of Duty. The shooter series has generated $10 billion for publisher Activision over the past decade, growing from fairly humble beginnings as a World War II FPS to become a sci-fi staple pegged to a yearly release schedule, reliably selling tens of millions of copies with each iteration. Sony has a similar deal in place with Activision for the PS4 version of Destiny, but the announcement of the new Call of Duty deal marks the first time the Japanese company has secured DLC exclusivity for the series. The new deal replaces a long-standing agreement between Microsoft and Activision that previously ensured that owners of Xbox consoles saw new map packs and add-ons a month before PlayStation gamers, a feather in the company's cap that it showed off at every E3. The question is now whether Sony stole the rights from under Microsoft's nose, or whether Microsoft was simply happy to let the deal lapse. Perhaps Microsoft realized CoD was finding more of a home on Sony's console. Reports last year indicated that of the 11.44 million units 2014's Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare sold in its first month at retail, 4.01 million went to PS4 players, and only 2.61 million to Xbox One owners. But those figures don't necessarily mean Xbox players are particularly sick of CoD — in November last year, Sony's console was cheaper than its rival's and riding on the back of a successful PR campaign that put it in the ascendancy. It may be, instead, that Microsoft foresees a time when Call of Duty's popularity is waning. Indeed, we may be on that path already. Sales seem to be slowing for the series, with Advanced Warfare reportedly underselling predecessor Ghosts by some 27 percent in the US. Call of Duty's sales appear to be slowing down But even if Call of Duty doesn't maintain its staggering market performance forever, by securing CoD DLC exclusivity, Sony has pulled off a fairly hefty theft from its biggest rival. The PlayStation 4 is now the de facto home for two of the world's biggest games, and dedicated players of both Call of Duty and Destiny would sensibly choose the console to get their hands on weapons, items, and maps first. As third-party publishers release on all platforms to maximize their profits and triple-A first-party games take more time and more money to produce, we can expect to see similar exclusivity deals changing hands in the future, with the two core console platform holders clawing to use major games to make minor distinctions between their black boxes.",0.5797969333369231,0.42020306666307694,0.8455599031365572,570,4.9350877192982452,325,5.8738461538461539,0,0,"Culture, E3 2015, Entertainment, Gaming",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Will it bore you to tears with statistics or show you a wild HoloLens demo? Sony tends to follow a set strategy: overwhelm you with game after game after game. Tonight, that meant some long-expected sequels, a few re-showings of known titles, and a handful of big surprises. Nothing was bigger than The Last Guardian, which showed up in the very first minutes of the keynote. There were bright spots after that announcement, but its sheer magnitude meant that everything went a little bit downhill from there. Unfortunately, the most exciting games are either coming at a nebulous point next year or don't have release dates at all. So no matter how exciting the games, the payoff will be a long time coming.     The Last Guardian — which concludes the trilogy of Ico and Shadow of the Colossus  — has been rumored at every E3 for years, and it's never actually appeared... until now. It was a bombshell of an event opener for Sony, with a short, highly cinematic gameplay demo. More incredibly, the game has a release date, albeit a worryingly vague one: it's coming to PlayStation 4 next year. That's essentially the premise of Horizon: Zero Dawn, based on the demonstration we got at E3. There's no release date, but it's being developed by Killzone studio Guerrilla Games. I understand that the Hitman series does actually have a fairly complex body of lore, but its trailers are all virtually interchangeable. I'd be hard-pressed to tell you how this latest iteration differs from any of the previous ones, except that I think Agent 47 is wearing a hat and there are terrifying fashion models involved. Is that enough to sell you on it? It had better be. Street Fighter V probably won't exactly be a revolutionary new title, but it's a welcome continuation of the classic fighting game series, which has been making do with expansions to Street Fighter IV for the past several years. The game should be arriving by March of 2016, and an open preorder beta is coming exclusively to PlayStation 4 in July.   No Man's Sky is the kind of game that is both incredibly exciting and a little worrying. Will a whole universe of procedurally generated planets actually be fun to explore? What do you do on them, anyways? The 2015 E3 demo didn't give us satisfactory answers to those questions, but we're getting closer, hopefully. Unfortunately, there's still no release date, though one is coming ""soon."" Look, how would you describe Dreams, the new project from LittleBigPlanet developer Media Molecule? It's like a surreal art and animation studio that uses a PlayStation controller and produces results you can share with friends. That's about all we can say for now. Destiny, the massively multiplayer shooter from Bungie, has gotten a couple of expansions, but The Taken King is supposed to be the biggest so far. Among other things, it will include a new map, new gear, and a new strike mission when it comes out in September. As if The Last Guardian weren't enough, it's a very good year for Japanese game fans. For one thing, Final Fantasy 7 is being remade, though that's just about all we know. (Well, except that the remake is green. Very, very green. And that it's coming first, but not necessarily exclusively, to the PlayStation 4.) For another, the Shenmue series has a third installment up on Kickstarter. It's not exactly a guarantee, but there's a... pretty good chance fans will fund it to victory.   PlayStation Vue, Sony's promising internet TV service, is moving beyond its initial three-city reach and into San Francisco and Los Angeles. More interestingly, it's going to start letting users subscribe to specific channels instead of buying package deals like most paid TV services. It's about time to start getting some real news for Project Morpheus, the PlayStation-based VR headset that's coming out next year. Unfortunately, Sony wasn't forthcoming at tonight's event, except to say that it hopes VR will be a social experience. Seriously, he's just the worst.

The speed with which fans have voted with their wallets for Shenmue 3 means the game is likely to be one of the fastest ever projects to reach $1 million in funding, and with 31 days to go, the Kickstarter campaign is now headed toward its stretch goals — including additional subtitles and extra content. Sony is now three for three when it comes to announcing mythical games this year Alongside the announcement of The Last Guardian and the remake of Final Fantasy VII, this means that Sony's E3 has gone three for three in terms of confirming long-awaited, almost mythical games. Shenmue and Shenmue II were cult hits for the Dreamcast and Xbox back at the turn of the millennium, with the games' meandering open-world play style charming, confusing, and enticing gamers in pretty much equal measure. Shenmue 3's triumphant Kickstarter shows that more than a few players were left hankering for more.",0.6080523716562571,0.39194762834374286,0.815175723634524,209,4.8325358851674638,139,5.3884892086330938,1,0,"Culture, Entertainment, Gaming",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

I remember 2006, a year in which our wallets were raided by giant enemy crabs, flipped over and attacked for $599 and massive damage. I remember Ridge Racer. I remember Riiiidge Raaacer. I remember 2011, and Mr Caffeine, and a Ubisoft show so awkward I had to hover my finger over the mute button to slam down whenever someone started talking. I remember 2012, when Microsoft tried to convince us the most exciting thing about video games was TV. I remember every company talking about the past, about six-year-old consoles like they were the future. I remember feeling like there was no future in games. But something strange has happened to 2015's E3. It's actually good. Bethesda's show made good on the promise of post-apocalyptic RPG Fallout 4 with several minutes of game footage, while EA's show introduced a new Mass Effect game and let us plan out our Star Wars fantasies with Battlefront multiplayer. Microsoft, still recovering from its disastrous 2013 show, packed its conference with new Dark Souls, Halo, and Gears of War games, before being outshone once again by Sony. So far it's the Japanese company that's ""won"" E3, tossing out sequels to fan favorites previously thought dead forever like treats to a starved dog. Shenmue III is not only real, it's looking likely to hit its $2 million Kickstarter target inside 24 hours, having knocked the crowdfunding site offline for a while at the time of its announcement. The surprise appearance of The Last Guardian, a game first announced in 2007, was a shock only equaled by the news of a legitimate Final Fantasy VII remake, something fans have been clamoring for over the past two decades. In addition to a genuinely exciting slate of video games, this year's E3 has also shown that publishers and developers are listening to feedback and focusing on representing their audiences. Women have starred in the shows, both as presenters and as playable characters, a move that feels like a conscious change after the developers of Assassin's Creed and Battlefield: Bad Company 2 previously said female humans were too difficult to include in their games. The result is the best E3 for years. While the opulent show still isn't perfect, for anyone who can remember the bad times of E3s past, 2015's event has made gaming feel more inclusive, more forward-thinking, and more exciting than it has for long time. Microsoft's events are a bit of a wild card. Will it bore you to tears with statistics or show you a wild HoloLens demo? Sony tends to follow a set strategy: overwhelm you with game after game after game. Tonight, that meant some long-expected sequels, a few re-showings of known titles, and a handful of big surprises. Microsoft managed an unusually smooth keynote at E3 2015. It adroitly stayed away from less popular topics like Xbox apps and the Kinect (which was totally absent) and included crowd-pleasing announcements like the option to play Xbox 360 games on the Xbox One. Well, that was quick. Just nine hours after being announced at Sony's E3 press conference, the Kickstarter campaign for Shenmue 3 has surpassed its $2 million funding goal. This means that if all goes to plan, the long-awaited sequel to 2001's Shenmue II will be available to play on PS4 and PC in December 2017. Microsoft announced its plans to bring Xbox 360 games to Xbox One yesterday, and I’ve had a chance to take an early look at some of the titles available to Xbox preview members. Behind the scenes, Microsoft has built an Xbox 360 emulator that runs on the Xbox One to get these games working, and it’s easy to spot. The vast beauty of space is about to look even more beautiful on your computer screen. Starting today, NASA will offer ""4K Ultra High-Definition (UHD)"" videos on YouTube, taking advantage of the site's relatively new ability to serve up 4K videos at a super smooth frame rate of 60 frames-per-second.

A two-minute trailer, shown during Microsoft's E3 conference yesterday, confirmed both the game's existence and an early 2016 release date. While heavy on the CGI, the game's first trailer was light on details, indicating only that — as with previous Souls games — you'll play as a warrior in a destroyed and dark fantasy land. Where the last game from Japanese studio From Software — Bloodborne — was PlayStation-only, Namco Bandai says Dark Souls 3 will see release on PS4, Xbox One, and PC. The leak suggests the game will introduce a set of new mechanics to the series, including ""swordfighting arts"" that work like special moves and let players customize their play style, the ability to create save-point ""bonfires"" wherever they go, and a mysterious ritual involving human sacrifices that will put a bounty on your head. Dark Souls 3 details leaked two weeks ago A European press release for Dark Souls 3 indicated that the game would mark the ""final episode"" in the series, but importantly, the studio also said that Dark Souls creator Hidetaka Miyazaki was taking on directorial duties. Miyazaki took control of Dark Souls and its predecessor Demon's Souls, before stepping away to oversee the similarly excellent Bloodborne and leaving development duties on Dark Souls 2 to Tomohiro Shibuya and Yui Tanimura. Speaking at the time, From Software said the change was a ""company decision,"" while Miyazaki himself said he wanted ""new expressions."" Now president of From Software, we can assume Miyazaki can simply appoint himself onto any project he likes, allowing him to go back to the cult series he created. While his replacements did a fine job with Dark Souls 2, Miyazaki is one of gaming's true visionaries, injecting Dark Souls — and Demon's Souls before it — with mystery, pitch-perfect combat, and an almost unconquerable depth.

Now you can. The Google Translate app is about to get a lot more powerful. In an update released today, Google is adding dozens of new languages to some of the Translate app's most powerful features, and smoothing out the app to make it friendlier to slow connections. In particular, the update makes Translate's visual translation features significantly more powerful, letting mobile users translate 37 languages via photo, 32 via voice, and 27 through real-time video. Today's changes are updates to two features added to translate back in January: a real-time video translation feature called Word Lens and a conversation feature that translates bilingual speech in real-time. The Word Lens feature lets you point your phone's camera at a sign or any other text and have it translated into another language, with the translation appearing immediately on your screen. It's designed to work entirely offline, without making any queries to Google's servers — convenient for those backpacking trips around Europe or Asia.   Word Lens supported seven languages when it launched, but after today's update, Word Lens will be able to translate back and forth in 25 separate languages, including Czech, Turkish, and Ukrainian. The app can also translate text into Hindi and Thai but cannot translate back, since the script makes it difficult for the program to resolve individual letters. The new languages aren't built directly into the app, but they're available as 2-megabyte modules, which can be downloaded by accessing the languages within the app. The update will also make speech-to-speech translation easier to use on a slow connection, after Googlers noticed more and more users relying on the feature in areas with bad connections. By making more of the translation processes local, the new Translate can run more smoothly in the face of an intermittent connection. Every day, Translate processes 100 billion words across the globe, and 95 percent of those translations take place outside the US, so the recalibration toward slower connections could have real implications in countries with less developed cell infrastructure.",0.4641309935039877,0.5358690064960123,0.19668650841670512,348,5.2614942528735629,219,5.9634703196347028,0,2,"Apps, Google, Tech",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Over the years, Microsoft’s home-built browser became bloated, insecure, confusing to use, and just plain hated by many users. A lot of people turned to alternatives, such as Google Chrome, as a result. With Windows 10 (check out our full review here), Microsoft went back to the drawing board and scrapped everything it had done so far with Internet Explorer. It built an entirely new browser from scratch, one that would shed all of the baggage of Internet Explorer and offer a modern, fast web browsing experience for Windows users. That browser is Edge. Edge comes with Windows 10 out of the box. And I should say up top that Internet Explorer also comes with Windows 10, though it’s buried in the OS, and Microsoft says that’s largely for compatibility with legacy enterprise apps. But Edge is the default, and it will be available across Microsoft’s product line, from PCs to smartphones to Holo Lens and Surface Hub. Microsoft said it built Edge to be clean, tight, and responsive. In my tests, it mostly was. Edge feels really lightweight and fast — and in some cases bare-bones — which is a refreshing change from IE. After IE, Microsoft has some work to do to rebuild users' trust, and the company says the days of cluttered, unwanted task bars and constantly changing home screens from nefarious apps are long gone. Edge uses its own rendering engine, which was built off of IE 11's engine, but slimmed down. Microsoft does note that it has done some work to make sure websites that are designed for browsers like Safari or Chrome still work well in Edge, which has long been a problem with IE. I did run into some bugs on some webpages with Edge, but mainly stuff loaded fast and accurately. Edge's default home page is informative and inviting Open Edge and you are greeted with a clean home page that asks, ""Where to next?"" above a combined search and address bar. Below that are links to popular websites, and below those is a customized news and information feed, that can display personalized news articles, sports scores, and weather information based on your Microsoft account. Unsurprisingly, Edge’s built-in search is powered by Bing, but what may be more surprising is just how hard it is to change it to another service, giving the impression that Microsoft really doesn’t want you to. To change it, you need to visit the search engine you want to use (such as Google), go to Settings, Advanced Settings, scroll to the ""Search in the Address bar"" setting, select ""Add New"", choose the engine that’s in the list, and click ""Add as default.""   Changing Edge’s search provider doesn’t turn off one of its coolest new features, which is integration with Cortana, Windows 10’s virtual assistant. Cortana pops up here and there as you browse with Edge, providing context when you highlight a word and choose Ask Cortana or when you type in queries for weather and other common search terms in Edge’s search bar. (Microsoft says Cortana can provide direct answers without loading a search page for 20 different types of questions.) A feature called Cortana Assist can scan a webpage and highlight relevant information, such as a phone number or address to a restaurant. Microsoft says that Cortana Assist works with 150,000 restaurant websites, mostly in the US for now, and it will expand it with other features in the future. Edge also has some other new features that are cool, but have limited utility. A Reading List feature lets you save articles and webpages for later reading, much like Pocket or Instapaper, though it doesn't work offline. Edge can present a page in a stripped-down format that removes ads and extraneous banners for easier reading, similar to Apple's Safari browser on OS X. A note-taking mode lets you doodle and mark up a webpage, then save that image right to OneNote or share it out to another app. I really like Edge's native sharing feature, which makes it easy to post a link to Twitter or Facebook without having to bounce between apps. Browsing in Edge can be a joy: pages load quickly, scrolling is smooth, and rendering issues are far less common than they were with Internet Explorer. On a Surface Pro 3 with 8GB of RAM and a Core i5 processor, Edge actually beat the latest version of Chrome in both the Sunspider and Peacekeeper benchmarks. Microsoft is employing a bunch of tricks to make this happen, including pre-fetching websites before you get to them, but the end result is all that really matters, and it is mostly good. It has also built Adobe Flash support right into Edge, and says it is working closely with Adobe to make sure performance is high and security is a priority. Still, there are times where Edge struggles and it becomes clear this is a version one product, such as when it offers to kick you to Internet Explorer if it’s having trouble with a particular site. Extensions and other power-user features aren't here yet Edge’s newness also means it doesn’t have a number of power features that Chrome and Firefox users have long been accustomed to. It doesn’t yet support extensions or plugins (the former are coming later this year and in a format that’s very similar to Google’s Chrome App Store) nor does it have the ability to pin tabs. There’s no way to sync your browsing history or favorite sites with your mobile device until later this year when Windows 10 for phones launches. Edge also doesn’t play nice with Google’s web apps, so if you’re a diehard Google Docs or Sheets user, you’ll want to stick to Chrome. Microsoft’s own Office web apps work great, however.   If you're like me, and many other people, chances are you haven't given Microsoft's browsers a second thought for years. But Edge will likely change that, and though it's not quite as good or feature-complete as it should be (which really can be said for Windows 10 as a whole at this point), it's a really great start and already much better than Internet Explorer. The days of having to spend hours uninstalling toolbar after toolbar during family holidays are a thing of the past, and Microsoft finally has a web browsing experience it can be proud of. It’s not yet a Chrome beater, but this time, Microsoft is putting up a fight.",0.6443871810054885,0.35561281899451147,0.1553818171444529,1101,4.7901907356948232,544,5.7959558823529411,1,6,"Microsoft, Tech, Review",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

At an event today in Manhattan, Yahoo announced a new app called Livetext, available tomorrow in the iTunes store. Yahoo describes the app as ""live video texting,"" essentially a combination of self-facing live video and chat. Each Livetext starts as a live stream akin to Periscope, which is then overlaid with text messages typed by the user in real time, scrolling upwards like a conventional texting program. Each Livetext is one-to-one and doesn't begin until both parties agree to open the channel, cutting down on the potential for spam or abuse. The result is a combination of traditional texting and more media-rich platforms like Snapchat and Beme. But while those apps work with both video and audio, Livetext is entirely silent, communicating only through muted video and text. The result falls somewhere between a Snapchat and a GIF, a combination Yahoo hopes will foster a sense of intimacy among users. ""We want to create the emotional connection,"" said Yahoo product manger Arjun Seti. ""We want to make sure you can get into a conversation as quickly as possible."" The app is also ephemeral, deleting the chats and video as soon as the app is closed. Livetext first appeared earlier this month for users in Hong Kong and Thailand, but hasn't been available elsewhere before now. Much of the team working on the app came from Yahoo's 2014 acquisition of MessageMe, an app with similar features.   Livetext is Yahoo's first move back into messaging in recent years, after effectively abandoning the once-popular Yahoo Messenger. Messenger apps like WhatsApp and WeChat have proven explosively popular in recent years, leading to increased interest in across the industry. Facebook launched its own stand-alone messenger app earlier this year. It's still unclear how Yahoo plans to make money off of Livetext, but for now, the focus seems to be on building a strong user base. ""We want to start by finding that audience,"" said Yahoo VP Adam Cahan. ""Once you get to scale, there are opportunities to monetize.""",0.4589966460890033,0.5410033539109966,0.8287190534474647,345,5.0028985507246375,217,5.9400921658986174,0,0,"Apps, Mobile, Tech",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Even with a few outstanding bugs left to quash, Microsoft’s new software marks a major improvement over its predecessors and should be considered essential, so that’s a fairly solid yes to Windows 10 itself, but what about the PC that runs it? The answer to the hardware upgrade question is much less obvious. Microsoft’s minimum spec requirements haven’t changed since Windows 7, making it possible to enjoy the latest software without having the latest PC. And yet, to get the best possible Windows 10 experience, with neat extras like Windows Hello facial recognition, you’ll probably want to upgrade your computer even if you don’t strictly need to. Unlike Windows 8 before it, Windows 10 really doesn’t introduce any new specific hardware requirements. Windows 8 was all about touch, so everyone was encouraged to grab a laptop-tablet hybrid device to get the most out of it. The closest thing to that with Microsoft’s latest operating system is the need for an Intel RealSense 3D camera to enable Windows Hello. There are 10 PC models currently shipping with RealSense cameras or you can buy one separately for $99. Like touchscreens or fast graphics cards, both of which Windows 10 can make excellent use of, one of these 3D cameras is an addition that’s nice, but not necessary, to have. You can be absolutely sure that the best Windows 10 PCs are yet to come. Microsoft’s OS updates always catalyze a big upgrade cycle among PC manufacturers, which this year will sync up with the back-to-school shopping period and the introduction of Intel’s Skylake processor. So there’s plenty to look forward to. But that’s a universal truth for anyone looking to buy a PC, and at some point you just have to put a stop to all of the roadmap tracking and decide what the best PC is right now. What better moment for it than Windows 10’s debut? Picking out the best Windows 10 PC is really no different from finding the best PC, period, which is a tough task given all the diversity on offer. Still, the computer cornucopia can be reduced down to a manageable shortlist if you know what you’re looking for. Here’s our rundown of the best available options for Windows 10 PCs, assorted by the needs you may be looking to sate.   There’s no universally accepted best Windows 10 PC, but the machine that comes closest is Dell’s XPS 13 laptop. It embodies everything good and modern in laptop design today, with a high-resolution display that has almost no bezels, a generous glass trackpad, and plenty of power condensed into a very compact, aluminum-wrapped package. The XPS 13 has raised the bar of expectations for what an ultraportable laptop can and should look like, but it also has the performance and practicality to be your everyday workhorse computer. The upgraded touchscreen version also allows you to make full use of Windows’ touch-friendly features, though that does come at the cost of some battery life. The Lenovo ThinkPad X250 is the more utilitarian and pragmatic alternative to the XPS 13. With the extended six-cell battery attached, this ThinkPad promises to last up to 20 hours on a single charge. It’s predictably thicker and heavier than Dell’s PC, but that allows it to include an Ethernet jack, a VGA output, and a more comfortable keyboard with deeper key travel — all of which remain valuable conveniences for business users. The X250 has a matte screen, as with the non-touch XPS 13, which can be flexed open to a full 180 degrees. Lenovo maintains the underrated ThinkPad tradition of making some of the hardiest and best hinges around, and the X250 overall feels like a computer that can withstand years of reckless abuse.   Both of our top two laptop picks offer excellent portability, great keyboards, and performance that's adequate for almost all tasks, but neither is a great choice for gamers on the move. If your idea of the perfect Windows 10 PC is a mobile gaming station, then you should look to Alienware’s 2015 laptop range. The Alienware 15 and 17 come with the usual litany of high-end spec options (including touchscreens), but what sets them apart is the compatibility with Alienware’s Graphics Amplifier, which is simply a breakout box into which you can install a full desktop graphics card. These laptops thus become a new sort of hybrid device: portable gaming machines in their basic form, and upgradeable, highly capable desktop rigs when connected to the graphics amp. Mobility isn’t a must-have feature for everyone, but a small footprint is always appreciated, and the toaster-sized MSI Nightblade offers a great option for new PC buyers. It’s part of the Taiwanese company’s gaming range, so it comes with neat extras like Killer LAN networking and extra-durable motherboard components, and it can fit a full-size graphics card. You needn’t think of the Nightblade as just a gaming PC, however: it’s fully customizable and can be adapted to whatever purpose you seek to fulfill. Plus, it has a relatively austere, universal look that can fit into most environments. There are numerous alternatives from the likes of fellow Taiwanese PC maker Shuttle out there, but the Nightblade seems to strike the best balance between compact dimensions and room for future upgradeability.   The most effective way to minimize the space that a PC occupies on your desktop is to just build it straight into your display. This sort of convergence is what all-in-one PCs are all about, and the most desirable among them today is the Asus Zen AiO. It’s not on sale quite yet, but we’re including it on this list anyway just because of the exciting trend it foreshadows. The Zen AiO will be among the first Windows computers with a USB-C port and it will be one of the few with an integrated Intel RealSense camera. Core i7 processors from Intel, up to half a terabyte of SSD storage, and discrete Nvidia graphics make the Zen AiO more than powerful enough to handle Windows 10 and a variety of tasks besides — but what’s most impressive about it is the slim and handsome aluminum case that all of that power is enveloped in.   Microsoft’s effort at building the best Windows 10 PC is probably on the near horizon, however the company already has a very capable candidate for the role in the Surface Pro 3. Featuring an integrated kickstand and one of the best keyboard covers in the business, the 12-inch Surface Pro is the best tablet-laptop hybrid we’ve seen so far. It even has a stylus, which works remarkably well and shows off some of the synergy of having Microsoft software and hardware working together. It’s not perfect as either a laptop or a tablet, but the Surface Pro 3 is more versatile than both.   No serious PC buying guide would be complete without including the honored tradition of building your own machine. The most personal and satisfying Windows 10 PC will always be the one you make yourself, and the options for doing so have never been more diverse or affordable. To set yourself up for the best of Windows 10, start with a graphics card that supports DirectX 12, the latest set of graphics APIs that will accompany the release of the new OS. Among other things, DX12 will make better use of multi-core processors and multi-GPU setups to deliver more frames of more detailed content on the screen. And to make the most of that graphical fidelity, you’ll also probably want one of those delightful 34-inch ultrawide monitors that highlighted Computex this year. Finally, though USB-C is still hard to find, making sure your motherboard has at least one of those future-facing ports will ensure your PC doesn’t feel aged prematurely. The best of Windows 10 is surely yet to come, but there are already plenty of fantastic ways to experience the latest and greatest from Microsoft. As ever, the question of the best Windows PC depends most on who’s asking the question. Once you’ve identified the things you truly need, the most suitable choice will quickly make itself apparent.",0.9189244853763006,0.08107551462369944,0.1591313131313167,1394,4.8629842180774752,663,6.3122171945701355,0,28,"Microsoft, Tech, Windows 10",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The operation, which has been deemed success, was unlike any other, because for the first time, it didn't involve a brain-dead donor who's heart was still beating. ""when we warm it up, the heart starts to beat."" Normally, heart transplants call for the removal of a still-beating heart that's put on ice for a few hours until it can be placed in a recipient. But two months ago, that didn't happen. Doctors removed a heart that had stopped beating, and placed in a machine called a ""heart-in-a-box."" That machine then revived the heart by pumping warm blood into it. ""We removed blood from the donor to prime the machine,"" cardiologist Peter MacDonald told WebMD. ""We then take the heart out, connect it to the machine, warm it up, and when we warm it up, the heart starts to beat."" Once the recipient was ready, the doctors disconnected the warm heart from the machine, and placed it in the patient. The technique effectively eliminates the current requirement for brain-dead patients. This means it could one day significantly increase the number of hearts available for transplant. It's also far easier on the heart than conventional techniques, because it reduces the number of heart cells that die during the transplant process, and limits the amount of damage caused by lack of oxygen. So far, only three people have received a ""dead heart,"" so the technique isn't about to become a staple in the average hospital just yet. Still, for the people who received these hearts, the procedure is nothing short of amazing.

I've been seated in a clear plastic chair, where I am about to try an experimental medicine for a brain disorder I don't have. The space is home to PureTech Ventures, the parent company of Akili Interactive Labs, which makes the new medicine. Since December, children in Florida and North Carolina have also tried the treatment as part of a formal clinical trial for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The medicine is unusual because of its delivery system: an iPad or iPhone. That's because the medication is a video game called Project: EVO. Until now, I haven't touched a video game since about 1991. What if I fumble the mechanics, or worse — what if the game deems me cognitively deficient? One of Akili's founders, 32-year-old Eddie Martucci, hands me an iPad and I see my avatar: a yellow humanoid, floating on a jet-fueled raft down a crooked, icy river. My task seems simple: I tap on blue fish that zoom overhead, but avoid the red and green fish, as well as blue birds. Of course, I'm also steering the raft to avoid frozen spikes along the riverbank. It's hard. It feels like I'm constantly missing my targets and smashing into the sides. Most frustrating — and addictive — of all: as I get better, the game instantly gets harder. If Akili's clinical studies are successful, doctors will one day prescribe EVO for ADHD as well as a variety of other disorders affecting so-called executive function — the ability to plan, inhibit actions, and quickly switch between tasks. The game has been part of a dozen clinical trials to date, involving people with ADHD, Alzheimer's, autism, and depression. The plan is realistic enough that Big Pharma wants in: Akili has already struck deals with two traditional drug companies, Pfizer and Shire. Within the industry, Martucci says, ""there's definitely a growing receptivity to digital technology."" Over the past few years, a torrent of studies on video games and brain function have spurred a booming consumer market. The ""digital brain health"" industry reportedly grew from $600 million in annual revenues in 2009 to more than $1 billion in 2012; the biggest players are names like Lumosity, Cogmed, Posit Science, CogniFit, and Brain Resource. But most companies aren't making medical claims; they haven't done the trials necessary for that. And what's more, scientists have said that these games promise quick-fixes they can't deliver. In contrast, Akili is navigating through clinical trials required for EVO to become an FDA-approved medical device. If they make it, they'll have access to a completely untapped market: patients. ""We don't see other people playing in that space,"" says Akili co-founder Eric Elenko. ""From a business perspective it represents a more lucrative opportunity."" THEY'LL HAVE ACCESS TO A COMPLETELY UNTAPPED MARKET: PATIENTS The drugs used to treat brain disorders don't just have side-effects; they usually don't address executive dysfunction. That's because drugs don't have feedback loops that aid learning, according to Adam Gazzaley, a neuroscientist at the University of California, San Francisco. ""Drugs are relatively blunt instruments,"" he says. ""They're not selective for networks and circuits in the brain."" Gazzaley got interested in scientific gaming around 2008, while conducting brain-scanning studies aimed at executive function. He wondered whether training people could improve their everyday executive function skills. But his laboratory tasks were boring; getting volunteers to play them for hours was a ""preposterous"" idea, he recalls. So Gazzaley got in touch with his friend Matt Omernick, a game designer at LucasArts who was working on Star Wars: The Force Unleashed. The duo, along with other engineers and researchers, had evening get-togethers to talk about how to translate the lab's tasks into something fun. ""He'd feed us sushi and beer and we would brainstorm,"" Omernick says.   The result was NeuroRacer, in which players steer a car along a curvy highway while responding to pop-up signs. Last year Gazzaley made the cover of Nature with a study testing senior citizens' performance on the game. At first, the seniors were horrible at it. After a month of training, they were better than untrained 20-year-olds. More important, though: their scores on untrained skills, such as sustained attention and working memory, went way up — and remained strong for at least six months. By using scalp electrodes to measure participants' brain waves, the researchers also showed that NeuroRacer training altered participants' wave patterns: the older brains looked decidedly younger.   Design-wise, NeuroRacer is like something I might have played on my Compaq 486. ""I hesitate to even call it a game, it's so simplistic,"" Omernick says. It did have one innovative feature: its difficulty adapted in real time. Most video games get harder as a player progresses through different levels, but Omernick says NeuroRacer was the first to update on the fly. While working on NeuroRacer, Gazzaley and Omernick met Martucci and Elenko; together they founded Akili. The company licensed NeuroRacer's algorithm; and Omernick overhauled the design to create Project: EVO. The most important part of EVO's design, Omernick says, was making it appealing for a wide array of players, from a 7-year-old with ADHD who loves video games to an 82-year-old grandparent who's never touched a tablet. ""We had to create something universally appealing that people weren't going to be intimidated by,"" he says. That meant no weapons and no deaths. ""WE HAD TO CREATE SOMETHING UNIVERSALLY APPEALING THAT PEOPLE WEREN'T GOING TO BE INTIMIDATED BY.""   The engineers also made EVO even more adaptive than NeuroRacer, capturing performance data 30 times a second. ""People are never in a spot that's either too hard or too easy for them,"" Martucci says. ""You just literally hand the iPad to a patient and it works."" Shire — the world's largest seller of ADHD drugs — invested an undisclosed amount in Akili early on and helped design its ongoing ADHD study. The trial enrolled 80 children ages 8 to 12; half have ADHD and the other half are cognitively normal. All will play EVO for about 30 minutes a day for a month.   The goal is to see whether there's any difference between the ADHD group and controls on the game's metrics. In particular, the researchers want to study multitasking, which is what happens when participants must both steer and tap on birds. Multitasking is cognitively draining and some groups have a hard time with it; the Akili team believes they'll find a multitasking deficit in kids with ADHD. The trial's results will come sometime in 2015. If that trial — about midway through the regulatory process for medical devices — finds a difference between the ADHD group and controls, then Akili will move on to a larger and more rigorous 'pivotal trial', testing the game against a placebo. The clinical trials mean Akili also has to worry about EVO's side-effects, notes Stephen Faraone, a professor of psychiatry at SUNY Upstate Medical University who's consulted with Akili. Boys with ADHD or autism, he points out, have an increased risk of problematic use of video games, spending more hours playing them and having trouble disengaging. (For the ADHD trial, EVO is programmed to automatically shut off after 45 minutes.) But the game format might make children less likely to avoid taking their medicine. ""It's a treatment that children will want to do,"" Faraone says. Children with ADHD are more at-risk for problematic use of video games The video-game approach makes sense based on what we know about brain circuits that are affected in ADHD, says Chandra Sripada, an assistant professor at the University of Michigan, who isn't involved with Akili. Brain imaging studies from his lab and others have shown that people with ADHD have glitches in areas involved in cognitive control, leading to an inability to stifle impulses to blurt out inappropriate words or act without thinking.""The idea that these games would train the very same circuits that are weak in ADHD is very plausible,"" Sripada says. Even if EVO doesn't turn out to be an effective treatment for brain disorders, it may be useful in other ways. Pfizer is funding a 100-person clinical trial to see if EVO data can be used to find markers for healthy elderly people who develop Alzheimer's disease. Currently there's no good way to predict who will get sick. The goal of the trial is to see whether Akili's game might be used as a biomarker in future clinical trials of Alzheimer's treatments, says Dean Mastrojohn, a Pfizer spokesman. pfizer is funding a 100-person clinical trial in alzheimer's disease Elenko and Martucci gave me a peek at my data from the 15 minutes or so that I played EVO. Happily, my 30-year-old attention skills are far better than I thought they were. I have a multitasking deficit of about 5 percent, which Martucci assured me is ""extremely low"" for EVO — my scores were similar to those of healthy people in their 20s. If EVO is approved by the FDA, it will be fascinating to see how its use compares to a traditional pharmaceutical. How will doctors determine dosage? Will regular consumers like me need a prescription to get it? Will there be an over-the-counter version? Though Akili is focused on the patient market, I would be surprised if it didn't eventually cross over into the giant consumer market of cognitive enhancement. On my long train ride home from Boston, as I play 2048 on my phone again and again and again, I find myself wishing I had EVO instead.

We're still early in the research, but there are already plenty of projects aiming to give human beings greater control over the inner workings of the brain.   The most promising technology, deep brain stimulation, is already in use across the world to treat Parkinson's symptoms and dystonia using a single wire surgically implanted in the brain. The same devices can also fight back pain by dropping the wire into the right part of the spine. It's a thoroughly tested method, even if the current applications are limited.   Another method is transcranial simulation, which applies current to the brain from outside the scalp. Research shows that it boosts a patient's memory and concentration, but results in poorer performance on automatic tasks like writing.   We change our neurochemistry all the time, whether with pharmaceuticals, naturally occurring hormones or drugs like alcohol and caffeine. But electrical intervention is different, in part because it can be turned on and off so easily.

A robot startup named GrabIt is making mechanical ""hands"" that use electrostatic attraction to gently pick up and transport objects. Powered electrodes, either on the surface of the gripper or on flexible, tentacle-like fingers, generate and maintain powerful attractive forces between nearly any object. In demos, the company has shown its grippers can pick up everything from cans and fruits to iPads, boxes, crates, and sheets of glass, silicon, or fabric.  Grippers are the business end of robots: without them, machines wouldn't be able to pick up or manipulate objects. But it's not easy to pick things up: many robots rely on mechanical movements or vacuum suction, both of which are big, expensive, and power hungry. More importantly, they can be less flexible than grippers that use electrostatic attraction — often they need to be reconfigured to pick up particular objects. And they can struggle to pick up fragile objects like sheets of glass. GrabIt says it's overcome that issue with its powered electrodes — they evenly distribute force across a large surface area. And the technology's not just for robot hands. One of the more promising ideas is to build the electrodes into conveyer belts to help sort objects or allow for steeper inclines on manufacturing belts. The company, which was founded in 2011, is still developing its grippers, but in the meantime, you can check out some videos of the devices in action. We just wish we had one of these for those pesky stuffed animal claw machines that have a penchant for eating quarters.

A Facebook spokesperson told the publication that the program would begin soon, but approval could come as soon as this week. NBC News is intending to publish a similar number of instant articles a day, The Wall Street Journal says, while both BuzzFeed and The Atlantic are looking to make as much of their output available through the new feature as possible.

But those concerns seem to have been soothed by positive results from the initial trial —  the nine partner publishers are reportedly only waiting for the social network's go-ahead before they start flooding it with instant articles. BuzzFeed CEO Jonah Peretti said that at first, Facebook will only make the articles available to certain groups of users, to gauge their reactions, but that the publisher plans to build the option to share a story as an instant article into its content management system. As for the delay between launching the feature and actually filling it with stories, Facebook said earlier this month that it had planned for a slow rollout all along, first gathering feedback on the original articles, then conducting a larger trial, before eventually allowing publishers to put out instant articles whenever they want.

That would make it second only to the hypothetical 30 million accounted for by the Comcast-Time Warner Cable merger, which is still pending. The Wall Street Journal first reported that the boards of each company had approved the deal for a price of $95 a share — which values the satellite TV provider at $48.5 billion. In a press release, AT&T confirmed the news, adding that the acquisition will be a stock-and-cash deal. Deal gives AT&T more opportunities to bundle services The two companies already work together to bundle DirecTV with phone and internet from AT&T, and the opportunity of offering complete packages was likely a part of the appeal for the acquisition. AT&T currently has very limited TV service through U-verse, which is available in a limited number of states and covers roughly 5.7 million customers. Meanwhile, DirecTV has struggled as it, unlike cable companies, cannot make up for lost TV revenues by transitioning users to internet packages. AT&T notes in a press release that the acquisition will let the company ""offer bundles that include video, high-speed broadband, and mobile services using all of its sales channels"" including ""AT&T’s 2,300 retail stores and thousands of authorized dealers."" In a statement, AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson noted that DirecTV ""is a great fit"" that offers ""a unique opportunity that will redefine the video entertainment industry and create a company able to offer new bundles and deliver content to consumers across multiple screens — mobile devices, TVs, laptops, cars and even airplanes."" The two companies have been in talks for some time, with rumors heating up in recent weeks before today's announcement. BuzzFeed first reported that the deal would be announced as early as Sunday. Previously, satellite TV competitor Dish Network expressed interest in a merger with DirecTV, but CEO Charlie Ergen called off talks after concluding that it was too expensive. AT&T promises to abide by the FCC's net neutrality rules for three years if deal closes  AT&T is quick to note that the combined company will offer stiffer competition to entrenched cable companies. Additionally, as part of the deal, AT&T notes that it will agree to abide by the FCC's contentious 2010 net neutrality rules for at least three years after the date the deal closes. Currently, those rules are in limbo, and the move is certainly meant to help appease regulators and gain their favor to approve the deal. The company also says it will expand broadband service in 15 million — mostly rural — locations where it does not currently offer service today. While both companies are primarily involved in US services, DirecTV has a large presence in Latin America — it's the largest pay TV provider in the region, with 18 million customers.

The Japanese tech giant's operating income was ¥26.5 billion ($257 million) off ¥7.77 trillion ($75.4 billion) in sales. Twelve months ago Sony reported a ¥43 billion net profit for 2012, its first in five years, but after these 2013 results Sony is now forecasting a second consecutive loss for the current financial year: it expects to lose ¥50 billion ($489 million) by the end of next March. PS4 and smartphones boost Sony's revenues Sales were up 14.3 percent year-on-year, which Sony puts down to the weakening of the yen, a ""significant"" increase in smartphone sales, and the launch of the PlayStation 4. The mobile and gaming divisions respectively brought in 29.6 percent and 38.5 percent more revenue than the previous year — Sony says the mobile phone business itself turned a profit, but it's joined in the mobile division by the loss-making VAIO unit. The digital camera business reported a sales decrease of 2 percent, owing to an overall contraction in the market, but sales in the home entertainment division were up with Sony highlighting the performance of ""high value-added"" TVs. The overall loss is largely down to restructuring costs. Earlier this month Sony revised its earnings forecast downward after announcing various charges associated with selling off its VAIO PC business, as well as a contraction in the physical media market. The company had previously expected to make a ¥50 billion, then ¥30 billion, net profit for the year, and replaced its chief financial officer with Kenichiro Yoshida last month. Although Sony predicts its smartphones and the PS4 to continue their strong performance alongside an expected sales boost from 4K TVs, the company plans further restructuring this year. CEO and president Kazuo Hirai is set to announce Sony's long-term strategy at a May 22nd briefing. His ""One Sony"" restructuring plan has so far focused on shoring up the company's gaming, imaging, and mobile businesses; attempting to revitalize the ailing TV division; and expanding into the medical sector. Earlier this week it was reported that Sony would concentrate on producing 4K LCD TV sets rather than more expensive OLED panels.

Governor Andrew Cuomo said today that the state's Public Service Commission would be reviewing the purchase to see if it was in the interest of New York and those currently subscribing to TWC within the state. ""The state is taking a hands-on review of this merger to ensure that New Yorkers benefit,"" Governor Cuomo says in a statement.  Review aims to ensure better service after the mergerThe commission's review is meant to ensure that Comcast and TWC will commit to delivering ""strong service quality, affordability, and availability"" throughout the state. TWC's service quality is already widely maligned in areas such as New York City, but with little competition, it hasn't really been pressed to address those complaints. Cuomo's particular interests in the merger, however, appear to surround the expansion of internet access, including how the deal would help deliver it to underserved areas and improve access in schools. Beyond reviewing how the merger might impact broader pricing and competition, the Governor's Office also specifically notes the commission's ""thorough and detailed investigation"" will be looking at protections around pricing for low-income consumers. ""To determine whether the proposed transaction is in the public interest,"" commission chair Audrey Zibelman says in a statement, ""the commission will examine the proposal to ensure services the merged company would provide will be better than the service customers currently receive."" Critically, the deal would give Comcast a major hold in New York. At the moment, it only has around 23,000 subscribers in the state, while TWC has around 2.6 million that it's in line to acquire. Comcast will have the burden of proving to the state that the purchase is in the public's interest — something that could be difficult using its shaky logic — and the commission intends to conduct a detailed investigation too. It's also considering holding public forums throughout the state to hear the public's opinion on the deal. Though the Governor's Office doesn't suggest whether the commission is already leaning in one way or another, it does sound as though it could be looking for certain service guarantees at a minimum to help it achieve state goals of spreading broadband. New York expects its review to be completed within four months, which should still allow Comcast to meet its estimate of closing the deal by the end of the year.",0.47961283706546215,0.5203871629345378,0.5135362230320125,425,5.1764705882352944,233,6.2746781115879831,0,0,Business,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

Microsoft has a weapon up its sleeve While Respawn Entertainment's Titanfall was the best-performing game over April, that's thanks to the release of an Xbox 360 version to supplant the original Xbox One launch; PlayStation senior marketing VP Guy Longworth says that Sucker Punch Productions' Infamous: Second Son was the number one ""new-gen"" software title in April. NPD does not track digital sales of software. Though the PS4 has exerted its dominance so far, Microsoft has a weapon up its sleeve.

""If you think back to the ’90s the marketplace was full of small companies. We've seen wave after wave of mergers and now there are fewer and larger companies,"" says Jeff Kagan, an independent analyst. ""Going forward we're going to see even fewer and even larger competitors going forward or moving toward a national, competitive marketplace for television, telephone, internet, wireless."" For AT&T, the deal is mainly about gaining scale in video and acquiring the bargaining power that comes with that to license premium content — particularly with the looming specter of a tie-up between Comcast and Time Warner Cable. AT&T will combine its 5.7 million U-verse TV customers with DirecTV's roughly 20.3 million US subscribers. ""All of a sudden you're talking about the number-two pay-TV provider in the country,"" says Dan Rayburn, an analyst with Frost & Sullivan. ""That means you can negotiate for better programming, and at a better price.""  NFL Sunday Ticket is a huge deal Having access to premium content is key to AT&T's ambition to become a major player in the world of streaming video. ""DirecTV is way ahead of AT&T in terms of licensing deals. Something like NFL Sunday Ticket is a game-changer for AT&T if they can offer it as part of a package to their wireless customers,"" says Rayburn. AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson said on an investor call this morning the deal will allow AT&T to offer premium video on all screens, from TVs to smartphones, from cars to airplanes. Just how important is big-ticket content like the NFL? The deal terms actually stipulate that AT&T can walk away from the merger if DirecTV doesn't win the contract with the NFL to renew that exclusive. There are synergies on the DirecTV side as well. Currently DirecTV can't offer its customers competitive high-speed internet as part of its satellite package. ""AT&T can bring high-speed internet to those same customers,"" says Rayburn. AT&T's Stephenson says that he expects the deal will mean 15 million DirecTV customers, many in rural areas, would be given access to broadband internet using a combination of technologies, including wireless. (DirecTV currently offers its customers satellite internet through packages with Exede, which can deliver download speeds of 12Mbps.) AT&T helps solve DirecTV's broadband internet problemIn a world where double- and triple-play packages are virtually ubiquitous, this kind of upgrade will help ward off competition. ""The one big thing we’ve been missing is a two-way broadband pipe to the home,"" says DirecTV CEO Mike White. ""With this deal we can bundle video and broadband to combat the dominance of cable."" Of course, the cry to combat ""the dominance of cable"" overlooks what White and Stephenson would prefer to obfuscate: DirecTV already counts over 20 million subscribers in the US alone, compared to 26.8 million for Comcast. By that metric, the satellite provider is no underdog. DirecTV also gives AT&T a boost to its bottom line — it reported a free cash flow of around $2.6 billion last year — and gives the telecom giant substantial new inroads in Latin America: DirecTV currently counts more than 18 million customers there. On the call this morning, Stephenson made several mentions of AT&T's desire to expand aggressively in Latin America, especially Brazil. ""If you thought the net neutrality folks were angry before, this is really gonna set them off."" The deal, like Comcast–Time Warner Cable, will need to pass regulatory scrutiny before it's approved. If both the mega-mergers do succeed, the media and communications landscape in America will have shifted dramatically. ""You're talking about a world where two companies control 60 percent or more of the paid-TV and internet market,"" says Rayburn. ""If you thought the net neutrality folks were angry before, this is really gonna set them off.""",0.6106387817660595,0.38936121823394054,0.8480151530621908,657,5.1567732115677325,372,6.002688172043011,0,0,"Business, Report",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

Russell Taylor, Samsung's UK marketing VP describes this as a ""one-off opportunity to push the boundaries like no other brand has been allowed to do before."" A Heathrow Airport spokesperson clarifies that Samsung hasn't bought the actual naming rights to the terminal, just an expansive ad campaign to be distributed within it. She says ""Samsung want to call it Terminal Samsung Galaxy S5 and we are relaxed about that.""

Confusing to use and volatile as a store of value, bitcoin has also been the frequent target of hackers, thieves, and incompetent businessmen. Despite bitcoin’s appeal to venture capitalists eager to profit from a new financial system, the value for the average person remains elusive. Circle, a highly anticipated new bitcoin startup that has raised $26 million, is hoping to change all that. The company, which is opening its service today in a limited release, hopes to be your friendly online bitcoin bank. Its web-based interface lets you deposit US currency and see it converted instantly to bitcoin without any fees. It physically isolates your bitcoin keys in cold-storage vaults and requires multiple ""signatures"" to bring them online. Its deposits are 100 percent insured, and it complies with US money transmitting and anti-money laundering laws. ""The focus is on making this easier for people to adopt,"" says the company’s CEO, Jeremy Allaire, who previously helped create the Macromedia (later Adobe) Flash platform and co-founded the video platform Brightcove. ""The focus is on making this easier to adopt."" Specifically, the focus is on making bitcoin easier to use for transactions as opposed to merely fueling speculation by investors. Its web interface offers a streamlined way for you to send or request money, review your transactions, and access information about your account. You can tie your bank account and credit cards to your account to make it easier to add and withdraw funds, or you can operate entirely in bitcoin. The important thing is that customers begin to see bitcoin as a convenient way to conduct transactions. ""We’re not driving people to buy and hold bitcoin,"" Allaire says. ""We want to drive that utility value and remove as much friction as possible.""   It won’t be an easy sell — at least not in the United States, where cash and credit-card transactions are relatively simple already. It remains unclear why the average person would conduct a transaction in bitcoin instead of cash, although advocates for the cryptocurrency say that merchants may eventually offer discounts to bitcoin users that take advantage of lower transaction fees. The service may have more appeal in countries where the traditional currency is unstable or being dramatically manipulated by the government, such as Argentina. Bitcoin users could eventually see discounted prices Circle faces a number of competitors in the race to become the leading provider of bitcoin services, including Coinbase and Bitpay. Its success also hinges on how bitcoin comes to be regulated at home and abroad. Many current users of bitcoin enjoy it for its semi-anonymous nature; Circle asks its customers to verify your phone number and email address. Linking a credit or debit card requires submitting your name, address, and the last four digits of your Social Security number. ""If your mission is to hide in the dark shadows of the web, we’re probably not going to be the service for you,"" Allaire says. Circle isn’t devoting much time at the moment to the revenue side of its operation, but it says it will make money on the ""spread"" from acquiring and converting currency at market rates. Over time, it's easy to imagine the company adding fees for services that it charges to merchants. But before any of that can happen, people have to trust Circle to do what Mt. Gox and others have failed to do: make a bitcoin wallet that’s secure and easy to use. The site looks clean and simple in screenshots, and the limited rollout of accounts to the general public will help Circle test for weaknesses.

FBI Director James Comey had given some details on the attribution process earlier in the week, but did not speak directly to the NSA's role in the process. For many, the NSA's involvement has been a missing link in the attribution of the attack, explaining the FBI's strong confidence in the attribution in spite of what many saw as less-than-convincing public evidence. A number of NSA programs could have been used to track the Sony files across the web — a task that recent Snowden documents referred to as ""trivial"" — and researchers have observed that the Xkeyscore program would have been ideal for tracking the Sony malware programs back to their source. Speaking to Fox Business before the conference, Rogers reaffirmed his agency's conclusion that North Korea was behind the attack. ""I have very high confidence,"" Rogers told Fox's Matt Dean.

Petraeus hasn't commented on the charges, but has apparently told the Justice Department that he has no interest in a plea deal. It's up to Attorney General Holder whether or not the government presses charges against Petraeus, but if it does, the result would be one of the largest court cases against a senior military officer in recent memory. The FBI alleges that Petraeus gave Broadwell access to his CIA email account and other classified information as part of the research for her biography of Petraeus. The investigation also involved the bureau breaking into Petraeus' personal Gmail account, where he and Broadwell communicated through unsent messages in the Drafts folder.

Following the demo, Ueda stood up in the audience to a round of applause. In the footage, a young boy and a giant terrier / chicken / goat-thing navigate treacherous ancient architecture. They both help one another to get from one place to the next. It's quite cute.

Microsoft has made a lot of promises about it. And oddly enough, we’ve heard most of them before, with Windows 8. Both were designed to acknowledge and embrace mobile and mobile apps, work well on touchscreens as well as laptops, and form the basis of a new phone platform. But there’s a big difference between them: Windows 10 actually does all those things. Three years ago, tablets like the iPad looked like they might be a serious threat to Windows. In response, Steve Ballmer, Steven Sinofsky, and the rest of Microsoft took a big bet on a forward-thinking interface that asked its users to forget their old point-and-click ways and embrace a tiled future. Windows 8 and Windows Phone 8 were related pieces in a bold strategy to move the company into a future of touchscreens and connected apps. That strategy flopped. Users roundly rejected the confusing new version of Windows, and without them, developers balked. But the iPad hasn’t killed off laptops, and consumers haven’t shown a big interest in touchscreen PCs yet. Another version, 8.1, attempted to stem the bleeding, but it was too late. The market had spoken. Like Vista before it and Windows ME before that, Windows 8 was the version of Windows you skipped. Now, a new leadership team for Windows under CEO Satya Nadella and executive vice president Terry Myerson are trying it all again. But this time around, the goal is much more ambitious: if they succeed, Windows 10 will be the final iteration of Windows: The one that will be updated like a service, continuously, in perpetuity. The one that finally makes good on all the promises of a synergistic ecosystem of like-minded devices designed to work together. In a series of exclusive interviews with The Verge, the team behind Windows 10 revealed how they’re doing it, why they think it will succeed, and what they’re working on next. This is the story of Windows 10 from inside Microsoft. Terry Myerson never imagined he’d last at Microsoft. ""I thought I was going to stay here a couple of weeks, but found that I really loved the people."" It’s now 18 years since Myerson sold his small company to Microsoft, during which time he worked on Exchange, Windows Mobile, and Windows Phone. Now, he’s sitting in front of me as the head of Windows, just days before the software maker launches Windows 10. It’s been two years since Myerson was promoted to the top job, and the release is important to him and the company.  Microsoft needs customers to love and want Windows enough to upgrade to it, thereby creating a massive install base to attract developers. The pressure is on. Myerson is confident without being arrogant — he’s more than happy to tease me about my MacBook. His forthright manner is mirrored in how he chose to release Windows 10: out in the open, bugs and all, even before the company had finished thinking through what it should be. Microsoft now solicits feedback directly from users in a very public way: over the past nine months, the company has been testing Windows 10 with 5 million ""Windows Insiders."" Anyone can sign up to test, and the results of Microsoft’s work will go on display today as Windows 10 launches to millions of people around the world. ""It has sometimes been daunting,"" says Myerson. ""You're putting it out there when it's not done, then you're getting all kinds of feedback and stuff that you know is broken."" That feedback has been constant and varied over the last nine months, and it will continue over the months and years ahead. Initially, ""there was a lot of hand-wringing around what was that going to be like and were people going to form opinions too early,"" explains Gabe Aul, engineering general manager for Microsoft’s operating systems group. ""I think we just decided to go for it."" Aul launched his Microsoft career in product support 23 years ago. He went on to help build Dr. Watson, a debugger that gathers error data when your PC crashes, into basically every product at Microsoft. Today Aul is the face of Microsoft’s Windows 10 testing. He receives Microsoft feedback, praise, and abuse on Twitter daily, but he remains perfectly cool. Even before we start our interview, I start moaning about some Windows 10 bugs I have, and he’s keen to listen, even emailing me a fix for a problem within seconds. He admits he’s ""passionate about quality"" after working in product support for years, and it’s clear he genuinely cares. While many will joke IT support is simply a help desk asking a user to reboot their PC, Microsoft has built a whole system to process the feedback it receives for Windows 10. It all gets collected in a database where Microsoft engineers can use tools to analyze it visually. If Cortana starts breaking in France, Microsoft will hear about it, and engineers can detect trends and issues based on pop-ups that appear for testers. Feedback doesn’t always come from within the operating system, though. The Continuum feature, which lets you switch between desktop and tablet modes in Windows 10, generated a wave of negative responses from  social media. That’s probably because Microsoft initially ripped out all of Windows 8’s good touch work, a move that surprised testers, before slowly building it back in. ""The trash can icon — the feedback we got on that thing..."" He cuts short to laugh because Windows Insiders (myself included) were really vocal in comments and online forums about the how ugly the first version was. Sometimes, Windows customers reached out to Myerson directly, including one during the time when the Windows chief misspoke and the result was that everybody thought Windows 10 would be free. ""There's this kid in Bangladesh who somehow got my email address, he runs pirated Windows,"" Myerson says. ""It was a great dialogue. It was more for me a learning experience about how did he pirate Windows, and why did he pirate Windows."" The conversation hasn’t changed Microsoft’s stance, though. Windows 10 still isn’t free for pirates. To handle feedback, the Windows build team hosts daily ""flight ops"" meetings to decide which prerelease versions of Windows 10 get released. A ""flight commander"" takes control of the team, for that day. ""He has a red hat that says ‘phone’ on it, and he has a black hat that says ‘PC’ on it,"" Aul says. ""When it’s time to talk about phone, he will take the PC hat off and put the phone hat on. That’s how we keep the room in check."" @mikevierling It's real :-) pic.twitter.com/dwF9EJOQkQ There’s also a red outfit hanging on the wall, a symbol of a time when one employee came to the ship room wearing embarrassing matching red shorts and a T-shirt (he’s an Ohio State supporter). It became a running joke. Now, if a Microsoft engineer enters the meeting with a bug that’s equally embarrassing, they have to wear something red. To continue with the red theme, Aul has a 3D-printed red button that’s become something of a Microsoft meme among Windows fans. Aul hits it when a build is ready to be released to the public. ""It’s mostly ceremonial, but it actually does send a trigger to the flighting system,"" explains Aul. ""The other thing it does, that most people don’t know, is it says something inappropriate in a Stephen Hawking voice because it’s got a voice synthesizer in there."" Aul wouldn’t give me any examples, but quotes are sourced from the team or jokes about his tweets. Microsoft’s willingness to solicit user feedback on early versions is a big change from the past. During the days of Vista, Microsoft’s lawyers ended up at my doorstep because I dared to write about prerelease versions of Windows. And while Windows 8 had a few public previews, it was largely developed with little consideration to feedback. Windows 8 shipped despite user concerns about fullscreen apps and a lack of attention to keyboard and mouse users. Microsoft’s management seemed to spend more time explaining every new feature in sprawling, technical blog posts instead of understanding why users hated the changes. Myerson has a different philosophy: ""It isn't one guy comes down from a mountain with a tablet [saying] what the right product is,"" he explains. ""We just believe the customer feedback shaping the product is how we're going to build clarity and confidence that we have a great product."" Microsoft may have been confident about Windows 8, but the ambitions to push touch computing didn’t work out. Microsoft has been forced to admit several times that it’s aware customer satisfaction rates for mouse and keyboard users are low. Microsoft’s new Start menu isn’t as domineering, it’s just designed to get them to move to Windows 10. ""Our strategic belief is, if we have a big audience of people… then developers will put apps in that store because there will be demand,"" explains Microsoft’s Joe Belfiore. Belfiore looks after the customization of Windows for PCs, tablets, and phones. He spent years building Windows Phone, alongside Myerson. To many fans, he’s the face of Microsoft’s mobile efforts. Microsoft has been constantly resetting and rebuilding its Windows Phone OS. Windows Phone 7 users couldn’t upgrade to Windows Phone 8, and it took far too long for Windows Phone 8.1 to arrive with features that should have been there from the beginning. It’s knocked developer confidence, to say nothing of crippling its chances at gaining significant marketshare. Part of Windows 10’s big promise is that the same apps can run across PCs, tablets, phones, and even the Xbox One console. As a result, the next phones will have an expansive set of apps from Windows 10 to jumpstart the ecosystem. ""We have one common operating system for all the device types that we are making,"" explains Belfiore. He’s also surprisingly blunt when he characterizes Windows Phone 7 and Windows Phone 8, products he was intimately involved in developing.  ""We've had a couple of, sort of, practice runs with phone and PC,"" Belfiore says, before pivoting to the presumably brighter future with Windows 10, ""We now have all the devices lined up. I don't expect to see the platform change again, in the same way it has before."" That’s encouraging to hear, but it doesn’t help Windows Phone right now. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella revealed recently that the company is restructuring its phone business, scaling it back massively as part of a $7.6 billion write-off from the Nokia phone business acquisition. Around 7,800 jobs are being cut, and Microsoft is planning to make fewer models. ""We are going to focus on a few great devices and the most notable being that premium consumer category,"" explains Myerson, adding, ""The direction we will head is the premium-branded lineup."" I push him on whether that’s a similar approach to Surface, and he claims ""the goal is to have one Microsoft device family that plays this role in the Windows ecosystem."" I’m not sure if that means a Surface Phone is in the cards, but it sure sounds like it. The first example of that one Microsoft device family will arrive later this year. ""One's coming. Maybe two are coming, but at least one is coming,"" teases Myerson, as he hides an unreleased Lumia phone in his pocket. Microsoft is rumored to be working on two high-end devices that will include a new Continuum feature from Windows 10. Continuum on phones lets you use the phone as kind of a PC. You can connect up a keyboard, mouse, and monitor and start using Windows 10 apps. ""I think it is the future of the phone,"" says Myerson. Belfiore is equally bullish about Continuum, but the phone version of Windows 10 doesn’t ship until later this year. ""The phone is significantly feature complete, but we'll continue to polish and tweak and iterate the things that still need to work,"" explains Belfiore. ""We'll put features in right up near the end. But in general, the broad feature set is set."" Windows 10 is also coming to the Xbox in a big way. A new Xbox app for Windows 10 is a significant addition, and it’s one of the best built-in apps available right now. You can stream Xbox One games to a Windows 10 PC and use the Xbox controller, and you can chat freely from a PC to an Xbox One with or without a headset. It’s a great addition for Xbox gamers after a rough couple of years. Sales have been second to Sony’s PlayStation 4, but it feels like Microsoft is recovering from the original unveiling of the Xbox One two years ago. ""The launch of Xbox One, it was from a brand and a customer pride standpoint… a tough time,"" says Phil Spencer, Microsoft’s head of Xbox. ""A lot of the original ideas around Xbox One didn't meet the expectations that Xbox fans have of what we should do with our product."" Spencer, who has worked on products like Encarta at Microsoft, has spent the last year or so getting the Xbox team re-centered on its fans and gaming. It’s an approach that Myerson says inspired the Windows Insider program. ""Xbox had this passionate focus on their fans and engaging with their fans and listening to their fans,"" says Myerson. ""Something that Phil Spencer just has at his core is his caring. He lives for those Xbox fans."" Spencer sees Windows 10 as a ""massive opportunity"" to bring Xbox Live and a single store to people. Today, the Xbox store is separate from the Windows store, but Microsoft is unifying them this fall. That doesn’t mean apps will be immediately available on the Xbox One, though. ""Getting to one store where all the content is there will happen a little bit later,"" says Spencer, meaning we’ll be waiting until next year until we finally see Windows 10 apps on Xbox One. Microsoft’s store isn’t designed to kill off Steam, either. ""Five years from now, I want Steam to be incredibly popular and successful. I look at the health of Steam as a harbinger of the health of Windows gaming."" What is coming this year is a Windows 10 update for Xbox One that brings a refreshed UI, speed, and Microsoft’s Cortana digital assistant. ""You can imagine scenarios of ‘Hey Cortana, what are most of my friends playing? What are most people watching?’"" says Spencer. ""The next step is being able to help you in-game, of really thinking about scenarios like ‘Hey Cortana, how do I get past this boss?’"" Further out, Spencer says that streaming PC games to Xbox One is something he wants to enable. ""We understand if you're going to go PC to Xbox, we need to get keyboard and mouse working completely so you could play those games. In terms of where we want to go with our platform, those are absolutely in the scope of things that we want to do."" Myerson and his team have shifted Windows 10 to a ""Windows as a service"" model, meaning regular updates instead of a major release every few years. It doesn’t feel like Microsoft really knows exactly how this is going to play out, but the Windows 10 release marks a milestone. But it’s not the kind of milestone we’re used to. Windows 10, even at release, is not done. Right now, it’s all about updates that fix issues and bugs. If you upgrade from Windows 7 and Windows 8 this week, then you’ll start to see those regular updates, and they’ll install automatically to keep everyone up to date. Myerson is confident in the quality of Windows 10. ""We look at these quantitative metrics and we think the quality's great, and we're continuing to fix more,"" he says. ""We're going to keep fixing. We're committed to listen and respond. Every day we're shipping out new updates with 30 more fixes."" That listening and responding sums up Windows 10. If there’s something wrong this time, then Myerson and his team will be listening. This can’t (and likely won’t) be another Windows 8 or Windows Vista mess for Microsoft. The company simply can’t afford to make those mistakes again. ""Our goal is to roll out Windows 10 and build a base of millions of happy and engaged Windows 10 users,"" says Myerson. ""Happy and engaged"" is one of those talking points you hear a lot from Microsoft. Myerson used it nine times in our hour together. But behind the PR-approved phrasing is a simple truth: it’s been a long time since Windows users have been either, and Microsoft needs to fix that. It’s as good a North Star as any, especially when your product development cycle is founded on taking user feedback seriously. If Microsoft can make people love Windows again, then the rest — developers and apps — is easy. If I’ve learned anything from speaking to the team building Windows 10, it’s that Microsoft is taking user feedback very, very seriously. Everything Microsoft is making — from the Xbox to phones to HoloLens — is based on Windows 10. It’s not just the foundation of this operating system, it’s the future foundation of the company. Microsoft doesn’t have a Plan B for Windows, and it’s proud of the fact: ""There's no one working on a Windows 11,"" Myerson says, ""but there's a group of people working on some really cool updates to Windows 10."" When Windows Insiders see those updates, you can be sure Microsoft will want to know exactly what they think.

Fortunately, your options for buying Windows 10 are a lot simpler than they were in the Windows Vista and Windows 7 days. As it did with Windows 8, Microsoft will offer four versions of Windows 10: Home, Pro, Enterprise, and Education. Before getting into the differences between these four options, it’s worth remembering that Windows 10 will be offered as a free upgrade to anyone running Windows 7 or newer (you'll have to make sure your Windows 8 install is updated to 8.1, though). It’ll match up as closely as possible with whatever you’re running — for most of you, it’ll probably mean you’re getting an upgrade to Windows 10 Home or Pro. Read next: Our Windows 10 review. If you’re buying a new machine or a fresh retail copy of Windows 10, the choices are nearly as simple — if you’re an individual buying a copy of Windows 10, you’re again getting either Home or Pro. Enterprise and Education are limited to institutional buys — so while many of you readers will likely encounter those versions of Windows, they aren’t ones you’ll actively set out to purchase. Fortunately, the days of way too many different Windows options are behind us For most users out there, the answer is easy: pick up the $119 Home version and don’t look back. It comes in both 32-bit and 64-bit editions and features the main new features and services that Microsoft has been promoting, including Cortana, Continuum, the biometric ""Windows Hello"" security feature, and — of course —  the new Edge browser. Stepping up to Windows 10 Pro (priced at $199) does get you a decent set of additional features for your $80, which power users will certainly appreciate. Among them is the Bitlocker disk encryption feature, Hyper-V for virtualizing different operating systems on your Windows 10 machine, the ability to join Active Directories (a big feature for business users), and a number of additional features. Windows 10 Pro also supports the ability to set your machine as a Remote Desktop host — if you’re using 10 Home, you’ll be able to join other host computers, but you won’t be able to set your machine as a host itself. A pretty easy question for most users For the most part, though, Windows 10 Pro feature is really only necessary for power users or people with clearly defined business needs — those people who probably already know exactly what features 10 Pro will include and whether or not they need them. For everyone else, Windows 10 Home is probably the way to go — and if you later decide you need to upgrade to Pro, you can do so for $99. But if you have an older computer, just make sure that you get the free copy of Windows 10 that is likely coming your way.

It’s the biggest update to Windows in years and represents a number of new directions for Microsoft’s premier software product. Windows 10 replaces Windows 8 and 8.1, and serves to attract those Windows 7 users that never bothered to update to Windows 8. There are a host of new features in Windows 10, ranging from updated interfaces to new apps and services. For all of our in-depth thoughts on the new platform, be sure to check out our full review. Perhaps the most notable thing about the new platform is that you don’t have to pay for it, so long as you already have Windows 8 or Windows 7. But if you’re looking for a reason or two to update your current Windows 8 machine or aging Windows 7 box, here are the top new features in Windows 10 that might make you want to. The most obvious change from Windows 8 to Windows 10 is the new user interface. It’s still flat and modern looking, but Microsoft went through great efforts to make it work for both touchscreen devices and computers that rely mostly on a mouse and keyboard. While Windows 8 essentially forced a touch interface on users whether they had hardware that took advantage of it or not, Windows 10 works equally well on both touch devices and mouse-and-keyboard PCs. Fullscreen apps can now be easily windowed on the desktop, and there are new ways to arrange and manage multiple windows for easier multitasking. For power users, Microsoft has implemented new windows-switching gestures similar to Expose on the Mac and native virtual desktops. All of these updates are pretty minor in themselves, but they add up to a much better user experience for the vast majority of Windows users, something that Microsoft whiffed on with its last version of Windows. If Windows 8’s take on the user interface was too different from prior versions of Windows for you, Windows 10 should be just what you’ve been looking for. A big part of Windows 10's interface overhaul is the new Start menu, which replaces the fullscreen Start screen of Windows 8. It’s a blend of the traditional Start menu from Windows 7 and earlier with the Live Tiles of Windows 8 and Windows Phone. Users looking for quick access to recently used apps, the file explorer, and power controls will be just as happy as those that want the extra information displayed by Live Tiles. It’s a really great blend of the old and new and rectifies one of the biggest complaints many had with Windows 8 (and Windows 8.1, which fixed some issues, but didn’t really go far enough). Windows 10 includes something that Microsoft has never offered in a desktop operating system before: a built-in virtual personal assistant. Cortana, which first became available on Windows Phone last year, is Microsoft’s answer to Google Now and Apple’s Siri, providing useful information at a glance. In Windows 10, Cortana is built into the system’s native search function, pulling in both local and web-based data whenever you perform a search on your machine. It also crawls your mail and calendar to provide updates on upcoming events, plane tickets, travel plans, and more without you having to ask for it. Cortana in Windows 10 is also able to be fully voice controlled and can even be activated with a simple ""Hey Cortana"" command. You can set reminders, perform searches, send email, add calendar events, and more with just your voice. If your experience with a PC has been mostly silent so far, Cortana might just get you talking to your computer and liking the results. Every major new version of an operating system comes with new versions of core apps for email, calendar, photos, mapping, and more. But with Windows 10, you might actually want to use these core apps, because the updated versions of them are actually quite good. The Mail and Calendar apps have been completely overhauled with new interfaces and features. They borrow a lot of ideas and design from Microsoft’s very highly rated Outlook app on iOS, and support a variety of email and calendar services. Threaded conversations, easy ways to delete or archive mail, and gesture controls make the new Mail app fast and efficient to use. Mail and calendar also provide a lot of data to make the Cortana personal assistant more useful, so even if you plan to use web tools to manage your inbox and appointments, it’s worth the time to set up your email and calendar accounts when you install Windows 10. The built-in Photos app has been redesigned with a new interface and plugs into Microsoft’s OneDrive service to make it easy to view all of the images or videos backed up from your phone. It also has automatic image enhancement features and basic editing tools. Maps has also been overhauled with a new interface and better integration with other parts of the system, such as Cortana. A big piece of Windows 10’s new interface is the Continuum feature, which lets devices that can be both tablets and PCs seamlessly switch between the two modes. Continuum allows Microsoft to keep the tablet-style interface ideas of Windows 8 without interfering with the desktop interface that works best with a mouse and keyboard. On a device like the Surface Pro 3, disconnecting the keyboard will switch apps to their fullscreen mode and turn the Start menu into a fullscreen experience. Pop the keyboard back on, and the interface will revert back to the windowed desktop and standard Start menu. Continuum will also allow smartphones to act as full-fledged computers when connected to appropriate displays, once Windows 10 is available on mobile later this year. Ever since Windows 95, Microsoft has included a web browser with its operating system. For years, that’s been Internet Explorer, which has been left behind by more modern browsers such as Google’s Chrome or Mozilla’s Firefox. For Windows 10, Microsoft is leaving the bloated and slow remnants of Internet Explorer behind and including Edge, its first new browser in 20 years. (Technically, Windows 10 still ships with Internet Explorer mostly for enterprise compatibility purposes, but most people using the system will be using Edge.) Edge is a completely overhauled browser that’s lean, fast, and supports modern web experiences. It also includes useful features such as integration with Cortana and a note-taking mode that lets you doodle on a web page and share it with others. The first version of Edge will still be too bare-boned for power users — conveniences such as extension support are not yet available — but for the vast majority of people, it should provide a much better web browsing experience than anything Microsoft has offered before. Windows 8 included a basic notification panel, but Windows 10 takes it to another level with its Action Center. Accessible via a swipe in from the right on the screen or trackpad or by clicking the icon in the task bar, Action Center organizes notifications by app and provides quick access to a number of commonly used settings. It’s completely customizable in terms of appearance and which apps display notifications, and you can even perform actions on certain alerts, such as calendar notifications. Windows 10 is coming with an all new Xbox app that lets you stream games from your console to a PC or laptop. It’s still a beta feature for now, but it works quite well over Wi-Fi and makes use of Windows’ native support for the Xbox’s USB controller. It also offers the ability to record your gaming session up to two hours in length right to your laptop’s drive. If you’ve been fighting for time on the TV to play games but other people are hogging the screen, this might be just the reason you need to get Windows 10. Windows 10 has a new, cleaner lock screen that’s available to everyone. But if you have a laptop or PC with supported hardware, the new Hello feature will let you log in without ever typing in a password. Just sit in front of your computer, and Windows 10 will recognize you and log in. It’s similar to image recognition login systems we’ve seen for years on Android, but Microsoft insists it’s far more foolproof thanks to the requirement of special cameras and infrared hardware. There aren’t many laptops that can take advantage of Hello just yet, but that will likely change quite a bit in a short time.

Apple launched the first salvo by giving Music listeners the ability to rate tracks with both stars and hearts leaving us struggling to define our feelings with such pictographic exactness. But Twitter’s taking it further by quietly replacing stars with hearts in a battle royal where only one favorite icon can survive.   Thing is, stars and hearts are not synonymous. To star something is to measure its quality. To heart something is to emote it. These are lessons learned long ago in grade school: gold stars were reserved for a 100 percent on a math test or when Mario defeated Macho Grubba, hearts were doled out like Valentines by a horny Periscope user. To change the icon would change the very meaning of a favorited tweet.   My colleague Micah Singleton was recently converted to hearts on Twitter, yet I’m still seeing stars. This is an outrageous injustice. If Twitter knew its users it would know that I should be the heart and Micah the star. The ending of Rocky makes me cry every single time and I can recommend The Notebook without any sense of irony. Micah is a man of uncompromising luxury. He’s the guy that rented a Vegas suite for one night at CES this year because he needed a suitable place to hang his aviator scarf. I’m the heart and he’s the star — this couldn’t be more obvious. Despite the slight, I fully agree with Twitter investor Chris Sacca who argued to replace everyone's starred favorites with hearts last month: ""A very high bar is set by using the word 'Favorite' on Twitter. Favorite is a superlative. It implies a ranking. In the early days of Twitter many of us interpreted the word literally and only keep a few Tweets in our favorites that were truly, well, our favorites. Today, many of my friends and I use the star as a 'Like' button equivalent or even a simple acknowledgement that we saw a Tweet. Whereas other people use favorites as bookmarks. However, the majority of users are baffled by favorites and they don’t end up using the star much, if at all."" There's no such confusion at Coachella, where fans regularly pinch their hands into the shape of a heart to show DJs exactly how they feel. Have you ever seen someone trying to convulse their hands into a star? No, because that would be stupid, even for Burning Man. Take emoji as another example. An April 2015 study published by the makers of the SwiftKey keyboard app showed that hearts are used far more often than stars. Hearts are the third most popular category after happy and sad faces. Meanwhile stars peaked at a lowly 26th, just ahead of categories titled ""Transport,"" ""Bird,"" and ""Farm Animals."" In Gmail, gold stars are useful as a means of private prioritization. But Twitter is a public forum where goons are quick to call you a ""fucking moron"" in less time than it takes to read a headline. Hearts mean you like me. Right now, you like me, and Twitter could certainly use more of that. Windows 10 is here. After nine months of public beta testing, the final version is rolling out to machines across the world. You can now upgrade to Windows 10 free of charge if you have Windows 7 or Windows 8.1 on your existing PC. Windows 10 launches on Wednesday, and you're probably going to want to update. The good news is that Microsoft has made the process surprisingly painless. Seriously, you just click a couple buttons and everything should be set. The man who paid $54,000 to kill a beloved lion in Zimbabwe was identified this week as Walter James Palmer, a dentist from Minnesota. Palmer, whose name was first reported by The Telegraph on Tuesday, traveled to Zimbabwe earlier this month, where he killed Cecil the lion with a bow and arrow after luring the animal out of a national park. But the bad news is that you may not be able to update this week, even though Windows 10 is coming out. Still, there may be plenty you can do to prepare. For all of the details, keep on reading. If the Empulse TT looks familiar, there's a good reason: it's a refreshed and rebadged version of the Brammo Empulse. Victory bought Brammo's motorcycle business earlier this year, taking its electric vehicle tech over to the famed (and notoriously deadly) Isle of Man TT for a proper shakedown — now, it's heading back to the retail market.

Even though fish generally reproduce externally by releasing eggs and sperm outside the body, a group of researchers back in 2009 found that at least one type of fish had started using internal fertilization about 350 million years ago. That same group of researchers, led by John Long of Flinders University, has now found a different species that they say was having sex as early as 385 million years ago, presenting what's now the earliest-known example of an animal that reproduced through internal fertilization. The findings are described in a study published in Nature.  ""They gave us the intimate act of sexual intercourse."" Called the Microbrachius dicki, the creature is one of many long-extinct armored fish. It lived in lakes around Scotland and was barely over 3-inches in length. While studying them, Long and his research group noticed that the fish's male fossils had small limbs called ""claspers"" that could be used to deliver sperm and that the female fossils had a pair of bones that could lock the claspers in place. ""This is the first time in vertebrate evolution that males and females developed separate reproductive structures,"" Long says in a statement. Similar structures exist today on sharks. Long says that a good number of features in modern humans came from the group of animals, called placoderms, that M. dicki is a part of. Those include jaws, teeth, and paired limbs, which are believed to have originated with them. ""“Now,"" Long says, ""we reveal they gave us the intimate act of sexual intercourse as well."" What's still quite notable is that this development eventually went away in fish before returning again later.

Google worked with Goodall and other local researchers to create its new Street View trek through the park, a voyage that required two researchers to wear Google's 42.5-pound Trekker backpacks deep into the African rainforest, as Smithsonian Magazine reports. Goodall says in a statement that she hopes the resulting view of chimpanzees — who share 98 percent of their DNA with humans — will inspire others to support conservation efforts. ""What I learned in my years of research at Gombe inspired and enriched me,"" Goodall writes. ""I hope that your journey through this website and the Street View imagery takes you on a similar voyage of learning and discovery.""

""The next oldest human for which we have genome sequence is the 24,000 year old Mal’ta boy,"" says Janet Kelso, a geneticist at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, and a co-author of the study published today in Nature. And the quality of the genome Kelso managed to produce is ""as good as the genome sequences that are available for present-day people."" In the study, researchers sampled bone material from a thigh bone that was found in 2008 on the banks of the river Irtysh, near Siberia’s Ust’-Ishim settlement. They used collagen taken from the bone to date it, and DNA samples to sequence the man’s genome. Once they had the full sequence, they were able to compare it to that of present-day humans, and count the ""missing mutations"" in the Ust’-Ishim man’s genome — mutations that had yet to occur in the human lineage. ""Given that we know that the Ust’-Ishim individual is 45,000 years old, we can calculate how many mutations accumulate per site per year,"" Kelso says. And ""we find between one and two mutations per year accumulated in the genomes of populations in Europe and Asia since the Ust’-Ishim man lived."" ""equally closely related to present-day Asians and to early Europeans."" Mapping this man’s genome helped the researchers gain a better understanding of the relationship between ancient Ust-Ishim human populations and present-day humans. ""We found that this Ust’-Ishim individual is equally closely related to present-day Asians and to early Europeans,"" Kelso says. This means that the population to which this man belonged probably diverged from Europeans and Asians around the same time, or slightly before, these two groups diverged from one another. If that’s correct, the researchers write, it’s possible that this Siberian human population ""failed to leave descendants among present-day populations."" Moreover, the presence of a human population in Siberia 45,000 years ago indicates that human migrations into Eurasia weren’t restricted to a southern route, as was previously suggested. Interbreeding with Neanderthals would have occurred 50,000 to 60,000 years ago  There’s more to this genome than its humanity, however. As it turns out, the Ust-Ishim man’s genome contains longer Neanderthal DNA segments than ours do today. This, Kelso says, doesn’t mean that he was ""more Neanderthal"" than we are —  the amount of Neanderthal ancestry present in his genome is similar to ours — but it does hint that our own Neanderthal DNA segments were once longer than they are today and reduced in size over generations. In addition, dating the bone and producing a complete genome helped the researchers determine when his ancestors might have mixed with Neanderthals. Previous estimates have ranged from 37,000 years ago to 86,000 years ago, but Kelso and her colleagues think that a mixing event would have happened about 50,000 to 60,000 years ago — or about approximately 7,000 to 13,000 years before this individual was born. The genome didn't provide evidence that this man or his ancestors had breed with Denisovans, however, a hominin population that's thought to have bred with aboriginal people of Oceania.   Having this genome on hand provides a new, independent way of estimating human mutations rates, Kelso says. Usually, researchers either use phylogenetic trees — a method that allows researchers to count mutations between closely related species — or estimates of errors in DNA replication to determine mutation rates. Now, this genome can help researchers double-check their estimates. ""By providing these genomes as public resources,"" Kelso says, ""we hope [to see] many more insights into the history of modern humans.""",0.6293406855929158,0.3706593144070842,0.8890791755654485,642,5.3021806853582554,332,6.2530120481927707,0,0,"Science, Report",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

So why can't they fund a trial to find out? A team of international researchers has gone begging for four years, looking for funding for a trial to settle a troubling question: does Depo-Provera, one of the most widely used hormonal contraceptives in Sub-Saharan Africa, increase a woman’s risk of HIV infection? The strange thing is that other scientists hope they will never run their trial. The link between Pfizer’s Depo-Provera and HIV isn’t new. In the early days of HIV research, scientists looked at every factor they could think of that might increase infection risk. Of course, behavioral factors like intravenous drug use generated a lot of interest. But other researchers went further afield, looking at everything from insect bites, to human urine, and hormonal contraceptive use. Although most of these factors were dismissed, the injectable hormonal contraceptive DMPA, a progestin-only based method that goes by the name of Depo-Provera, continued to raise concerns. In 1998, for instance, researchers wrote that women who use DMPA exhibit higher rates of HIV infection. But like many others, this study was based on observations, and was easily overlooked. Today, we don’t know much more. A 2013 review of the observational data estimates that DMPA might be associated with 48 to 100 percent increase in HIV acquisition risk. That would mean an additional 27,000 to 130,000 cases globally each year — 88 percent of which would occur in Sub-Saharan Africa. Still, most researchers think these numbers aren’t enough to justify a drug ban. ""I participated in several of the studies that suggested there was increased HIV risk associated with injectable progestin contraception, most specifically Depo-Provera,"" says Jared Baeten, an infectious disease expert at the University of Washington and one the researchers attached to the proposed trial, which has been codenamed ECHO. ""And when I first saw the results, I felt tremendous concern, but also skepticism, because the data from the observations is not as rigorous of an approach as a trial would be — observational results don’t fully reflect the truth.""   Every study that has linked Depo-Provera — or DMPA, as researchers call it — to HIV infection has been observational. So although a well-regarded DMPA study estimates that the contraceptive might double a woman's risk of acquiring HIV, policy-makers and charitable organizations that provide countries with contraceptives have yet to change their policy on Depo-Provera. That’s where the new trial comes in; it could provide confirmation of the observational results — or show that they weren’t reliable. The proposed trial has its share of critics, though. Some think it would unethical to ask women to take DMPA for an extended period, because it would amount to knowingly putting them in harm’s way; these critics think the observational data already supports an immediate phasing out of DMPA. Others think a trial shouldn’t lead to a global ban on DMPA, even if results show that the drug has increased the rate of HIV infections. In most countries, removing it would ultimately cause more deaths than leaving it be, some experts say, because a greater number of women would end up dying during childbirth without it. The most alarming explanation for the trial’s funding woes is also the hardest to prove: some HIV activists suggest that women’s health advocates are afraid of what we might learn if the trial goes ahead. If the link researchers have observed between DMPA and HIV is real, that would mean that women’s health advocacy groups are inadvertently responsible for the high HIV infection rates seen in countries like South Africa, and Mozambique — countries where over 45 percent of women rely on injectable contraceptives like DMPA.   Part of the problem with trying to get at ""the truth"" is that scientists haven’t had much luck finding a mechanism that might explain how progestin-based contraceptives like DMPA make women more vulnerable to HIV infection. In 1996, researchers found that implants filled with progesterone — the non-synthetic equivalent of progestin — make the vaginal epithelium of macaques thinner, which increases their likelihood of acquiring SIV, the non-human primate version of HIV, by 7.7 times. ""We do see that in macaques and in fact, in certain HIV research studies, macaques are injected with DMPA in order to make them more vulnerable to SIV, so that SIV has a greater chance of taking hold,"" says Chelsea Polis, an epidemiologist at the Guttmacher Institute in New York City. This finding, however, wasn’t replicated in a recent study conducted on women who took the drug for up to two years. What researchers found instead is that DMPA seems to reduce the number of CD3-T cells — cells involved in the human immune system response — that are able to infiltrate the vaginal mucous membrane. This immunological effect hasn’t been directly linked to HIV infection, however, so little is known about how this research avenue might eventually play out. Beaton's skepticism at his own results also stems from the fact that a number of studies have noted no difference in HIV acquisition between women who take the drug and women who don’t. For example, one 2007 study that looked at HIV acquisition in 4,200 South African women found no difference between those who didn’t use hormonal contraceptives and those who used either the Pill or injectable contraceptives. These types of contradictions aren’t unusual for observational studies, however, as results can vary based on the population sampled. Still, the World Health Organization thinks these inconsistencies are enough to raise doubts; after reviewing the evidence in 2012, it decided to continue recommending the use of DMPA, and told women who use it to use condoms. To many, the WHO’s stance was wholly disappointing. In an emailed statement, Pfizer said that the observational-only aspects of the Depo-Provera studies that have taken place so far can't be trusted. ""Couples seeking to prevent both unintended pregnancy and HIV transmission should be strongly advised to use dual protection — condoms and another effective contraceptive method, such as hormonal contraceptives,"" said Pfizer spokesman MacKay Jimeson. But convincing a partner to use a condom isn’t always easy for women, says Mitchell Warren, executive director at AVAC, an HIV prevention advocacy group. Some women don’t have the power to impose their use. That’s why he thinks the trial should take place. Although promoting condom use is right and important, it’s also key to make sure women know what kind of risks they run by taking a drug — in this case, a contraceptive. And right now, that isn’t something health care providers can do; when it comes to HIV, scientists don’t know what sorts of risks DMPA may or may not carry. Under the trial’s current proposal, ECHO researchers would enroll 7,800 women in Sub-Saharan Africa, and assign each of them to one of three forms of contraception: the copper IUD, a contraceptive implant, and the injectable DMPA. These women would then receive regular testing for HIV over several months. This is an adequate trial formulation, Warren says. But it could have been a lot better. When the researchers first proposed the trial, ""we decided to go for the Rolls-Royce of clinical trials, and made a proposition to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,"" says Ward Cates, one of the researchers associated with ECHO and an HIV researcher at the nonprofit FHI 360. This ""Rolls-Royce"" approach would have cost $80 million, enrolled 10,000 women and would have a included a second injectable contraceptive called NET-EN. But the researchers soon realized few funding agencies were willing to fund the trial. Cates thinks the trial’s interdisciplinary nature might be to blame. Family planning agencies see the trial as an HIV trial, he says, whereas agencies that focus more on HIV think about the trial in terms of women’s health — a field that has been largely segregated from HIV prevention efforts, despite the fact that women make up 50 percent of those living with HIV worldwide. ""That's the problem of this whole study,"" Cates says. ""[We ended up seeing] this juggling of well, ‘Do you own this, do we own this, and is it your responsibility to fund it or is it ours?’""   Cates’ group chose the Gates Foundation, which has prioritized both HIV research and the distribution of contraceptive methods — DMPA included — to women in Africa. So the ECHO group was elated when the Gates Foundation pledged to fund the trial for up to $30 million in February 2013. But with a budget of $80 million, that wasn’t nearly enough; by the spring of 2014, the group had only raised an additional $10-12 million. So the researchers decided to cut the cost of the trial down to $60 million. And then again down to $48 million in August. Today, the ECHO trial is just $1 million short of its goal, and the researchers are hopeful. The trial has managed to gather the support of a few more organizations and the South African government — but the largest funding bodies (the NIH, the WHO, and UNAIDS) aren’t among them. And as the researchers begin making plans to start the trial sometime in mid-2015, those who oppose the ECHO trial continue to make themselves heard. Warren is hesitant to say other groups don't want to know whether DMPA is responsible for increasing the rate of HIV infection among women. He does say he hasn’t seen many women’s health advocates acknowledging DMPA’s potential risk. That may be because DMPA is the focus of many reproductive health programs. A finding that firmly links DMPA and HIV would be  ""a significant challenge"" for existing reproductive health programs, he says. E. Tyler Crone, a human rights attorney and founder of the Athena Network, an HIV advocacy group, also thinks that some women’s health advocates have shied away from the issue. ""I often feel that some people are unwilling to question DMPA… because they fear it will undo their family planning efforts,"" she says. No organization has publicly admitted to this. But the sense that women’s health advocates are worried about the trial’s outcome remains. ""I think we all envision ourselves as being committed to family health,"" Crone says. But if DMPA does increase a woman's’ risk of HIV infection, ""are we going to feel like we have done more harm than good?"" ""A pretty cynical view"" Then there's the ethical issue. The most recent meta-analysis — a study that compares other studies — has shown women taking Depo have a 1.5 times increased risk of acquiring HIV. ""Our best guess is that it does increase the risk slightly,"" says Heidi Jones, a reproductive health expert at City University of New York who has written about the ethics of the trial. Given that information, asking thousands of women to take DMPA for a clinical trial would be unethical, she says. ""We owe the ethical commitment to individuals in our study, and the benefit to society can never take the place of our obligation to individual participants."" Instead, Jones suggests phasing out DMPA, and making more methods of contraception available to women in Africa. She also thinks that researchers should focus on finding the mechanism that allows HIV to infect women more easily. ""We should work to find evidence that [DMPA] suppresses the immune system,"" she says. Jones isn’t the only one worried about ethics. ""I wish there was another way, that I could wave my magic wand and we could move this issue without the trial,"" says Crone, Athena Network’s founder. But the WHO doesn’t appear ready to budge on this issue, she says, ""so I guess I’m a reluctant supporter of it."" Polis says she rethinks her approach to the issue every time a new study is published. ""There is genuine uncertainty among the experts over whether or not the link is real,"" she says. This uncertainty is the main reason some scientists have called for a trial. But even if the trial does show that the contraceptive puts women at moderate increased risk for HIV acquisition, she doesn’t think those results will warrant immediate discontinuation of DMPA use on a global level. Removing it might reduce the number of new HIV infections, but banning DMPA is the kind of decision that needs to balanced against other factors — like how effective it is at preventing unwanted pregnancies, and its ease of use. Childbirth is still life-threatening Because DMPA only needs to be administered once every three months, it’s a lot easier to take reliably. It also comes with a higher efficacy rate than the birth control pill. The fact that a single dose lasts so long is also a huge advantage for women who don’t have control over condom use: they can use Depo-Provera covertly, Polis says. Although some women manage to do that with the birth control pill, hiding a long-lasting injection is far easier. In addition, the injection is more practical than implants, because unlike implants, doses of DMPA can be administered by nonmedical providers — so they’re easier to get. And when women want to start having children, they can simply let it wear off. Finally, early research suggests that DMPA might be one of the only hormonal contraceptives that doesn’t become less effective at preventing pregnancy when taken alongside drugs that treat HIV. Women who are HIV positive and don’t wish to have children therefore benefit from having the drug around. Given these benefits, Polis says, removing DMPA in countries that don’t carry a high risk of HIV infection wouldn’t make much sense. But this isn't just about the injectable approach; Polis also worries removing the contraceptive could increase deaths. Removing the drug would likely cause more women to become pregnant  against their wishes. And because childbirth is still a life-threatening event in some developing countries, phasing out DMPA may lead to an increase in overall deaths among women — particularly  in regions with high use of injectables and high rates of maternal  mortality. ""If we remove DMPA all over the world tomorrow, it’s possible that a certain proportion of women would switch to this method or that method, but many would be left without alternative, accessible, and acceptable contraceptive options,"" she says, citing a 2013 study she published in AIDS in which she and other colleagues modeled the possible outcomes of a removal of DMPA.   There's one more thing. Polis says that removing Depo would increase HIV transmission — between mother and child. ""What we found is that unless the true effect [of DMPA] more than doubles the risk of HIV, continuing to use DMPA would result in a net public benefit, with the possible exception of certain countries in southern Africa,"" Polis says — countries where close to half of women use injectable contraceptives and HIV infection rates are high. Polis’ position isn’t exactly popular, and some women’s health activists have gone to great lengths to let her know. In 2013, one of her unpublished reviews, a manuscript that summarized findings from eight observational DMPA studies that was being evaluated by The Lancet Infectious Diseases, ended up in the hands of The Rebecca Project for Justice, a US-based women’s advocacy group that opposes the use of DMPA. It’s not entirely clear how this happened, but an editor’s note indicates that a reviewer might have been to blame. The Rebecca Project published the study — which was peer-reviewed and later published by the journal — by without the authors’ or the journal’s permission, because they felt that The Lancet was attempting to hide the truth about DMPA from the public. Someone sent the group the document, because the leaker didn’t believe it would be published, says Kwame Fosu, policy director at The Rebecca Project for Justice. ""[The journal’s editors] told me they were going to, but I don’t believe that."" Despite repeated requests from the journal and legal action from Elsevier, the journal’s publisher, The Rebecca Project for Justice refused to take the manuscript down (it can still be found on their website, here). ""As far as we’re aware, our publishers, Elsevier, have now exhausted credible legal means of redress,"" said Daisy Barton, The Lancet’s media relations manager, by email. ""The matter is not currently being pursued further."" It’s been four years since the ECHO trial was first proposed, and although the researchers have nearly reached their goal, rumors about potential funding deadlines have surfaced. ""As far are we understand it, if enough funding isn’t made available, it’s possible that the money might disappear,"" Warren says. ""There’s a rumor that the deadline is the end of the year."" Cates says that at one time, there was a fear that funders might move on to other research questions. ""But now we are hopeful,"" he says. ""Hopefully by getting started with planning the trial, and showing the progress that we have made on whittling the budget down, those pledges won’t go away by the end of the year."" When The Verge contacted The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to ask about its funding of the trial, a representative said that it was ""actively engaged in ongoing conversations with partners about funding and potential grantees, to ensure that the trial is fully funded."" But it has yet to make any grants to support trial implementation. According to Cates, the Gates Foundation has told them they can start planning the trial. And they will keep fundraising until they reach their goal. Meanwhile, the WHO has stayed on message: the condom is still king, regardless of concerns over women's ability to make their partners don one. ""The most important message,"" says Mary Gaffield, a WHO epidemiologist, ""is that — and we continue to say this — the only method of contraception that protects against STIs, including HIV, are condoms."" Right now, she says, there are ""no restrictions on these hormonal contraceptive methods for women who are at high risk for HIV,"" and ""DMPA remains a very effective contraceptive method."" Whether or not this stance is endangering women remains, in the absence of a rigorous trial, anyone’s guess.

In addition, customs personnel ask about travel history, and look for symptoms of the disease. These precautions stop short of a travel ban — a measure that is becoming increasingly popular among certain politicians. A travel ban would likely make the outbreak in West Africa even worse because it would spread panic and cause more people to become infected, scientists say. Controlling the outbreak in Africa would therefore become even harder. Precautions that stop short of a travel ban At present, the US does not have an Ebola outbreak. Two nurses in Dallas were diagnosed with Ebola after treating Thomas Duncan, a now-deceased Liberian citizen who travelled to the US to visit family members. So far, the Ebola outbreak has been concentrated in three African countries: Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. Since the beginning of the outbreak, about 9,200 have been infected, and more than 4,500 have died from the disease.

""The only solution is how can we join our efforts to contain those kinds of viruses and epidemics at their epicenter, right where they start."" Countries should focus on raising funds and providing treatment to those with confirmed cases of Ebola, said Sy. If they can do that, the outbreak could be contained within six months. The outbreak could be contained within six months Sy isn’t the first person to speak out against travel bans. The president of the World Bank, Jim Yong Kim, said last week that Ebola needed to be stopped at the source, not through travel bans. Restricting people's movements would make the outbreak in West Africa harder to halt, because a ban would limit aid workers’ movements, and increase the rate of new infections. Still, a number of politicians in the US have called for a travel ban, despite the fact that the US has only experienced two Ebola transmissions thus far. At the moment, the US government demands that people coming from countries with an Ebola outbreak enter the country through one of five airports, where they can go through enhanced screening procedures.

The story is a total hoax, put out by a deeply cynical site called the National Report. But to the 340,000 people who saw it pop up in their news feed, it looked real enough to share. ""We’ve seen stories on satire sites — fake news sites — getting tremendous traction because they feed on people’s fears,"" says Craig Silverman, the founder of Emergent.Info. ""It’s really becoming an epidemic now."" Silverman launched Emergent with Columbia’s Tow Center for Digital Journalism last month to track the spread of rumors online in real time. Many of the stories he’s seen have been organic rumors, things like the pumpkin spice condom or the 50-foot crab that begin life as jokes, get taken out of context, are written up in news stories, and take off on Facebook before anyone bothers to verify them. But he’s finding that a surprising number, especially when it comes to Ebola, are deliberate attempts to deceive. ""I've had people emailing me about the Purdon story, very scared, asking if it was true,"" says Silverman.  ""It’s really becoming an epidemic now"" These sites claim to be satirical but lack even incompetent attempts at anything resembling humor. They’re really fake news sites, posting scary stories and capitalizing on the decontextualization of Facebook’s news feed to trick people into sharing them widely. On Facebook, where stories look pretty much the same no matter what publication they’re coming from, and where news feeds are already full of panicked school closures, infected ISIS bogeymen, and DIY hazmat suits, the stories can fool inattentive readers into thinking they’re real. Panicked, they share, spreading the rumor farther and sending more readers to the story, generating ad revenue for the site. It’s proving to be a very successful strategy, particularly for a site called the National Report, which saw its traffic spike to 2 million unique visitors yesterday according to Quantcast. Very few are repeat visitors, meaning they’re just seeing the link on Facebook and clicking.  The tendency for bad satire to take off on Facebook is well-documented. I’m not talking about The Onion, which is absurd and funny enough that most people paying attention can’t mistake it for real news, and well-enough known that anyone who does will be quickly mocked. The problem is more with sites like The Daily Currant, whose brand of just-barely-unbelievable stories are political share-bait and have suckered more than a few actual publications into aggregating its stories as news. The Awl’s John Herrman calls it the Borowitz Problem, after The New Yorker humor columnist whose pandering fake news often gets shared far out of proportion — I hope — to the people who actually find it funny. ""When you publish a fake headline that sounds almost real, place it on top of satire that's soft enough to skim without really reading, give it a newyorker.com URL, and promote it on Facebook, where basically every headline sounds like satire now, you know what you're really doing,"" Herrman writes.   The new sites like National Report take this phenomenon and push it to its amoral conclusion. If satire mistaken for news can get shared more on Facebook than real news, and you're totally unscrupulous about how you get your clicks, why not drop the satire pretense and just write fake news? ""What we’ve seen emerge over the last year is a much more malicious breed,"" says Silverman, ""which are not driven by trying to do comedy or satire, but by what kind of fake stuff can we spin up to get shares that earn us money."" The National Report appears to have begun as an inept satire site a little over a year ago. Notable past stories include the news that residents of Hanna, Oklahoma, were going to be implanted with RFID chips as part of an Obamacare pilot program, which freaked people out sufficiently to warrant a debunking in the Caspar Star Tribune — ""Satirical article creates stir in Wyoming town"" — in which the Report’s publisher, Allen Montgomery, mocks anyone dumb enough not to fact-check his stories. That was back when the site called itself satire in a now-deleted disclaimer. More recently, the Report wrote a tremendously popular story claiming that Facebook would begin charging users, replete with fake quotes from Mark Zuckerberg. Earlier this week it posted a story about Banksy getting arrested and identified, repeatedly debunked but still getting tens of thousands of likes. On October 1st, National Report posted a story claiming that an entire Texas town was quarantined after a family tested positive for Ebola. The story exploded on Facebook, accruing hundreds of thousands of likes. The Report has since thrown all its fake resources into the fake story, sending a fake journalist to file fake reports from the ground about fake outbreaks, quarantines, and CDC coverups. On Monday the site claimed that a class of kindergartners had been infected by a Liberian exchange student, a xenophobic detail in keeping with the site’s right-wing tone. Now it’s pushing a story about ISIS Ebola agents in Arizona.      Facebook is the major vector for these fake news stories, partly because Facebook drives much of the traffic to news stories generally, but also because certain characteristics make it a powerful platform for disseminating rumors. Sites, no matter their pedigree, look pretty much the same in your news feed — just a headline and a caption — making disreputable sites harder to detect. You’re more likely to trust news coming from someone you know. Readers often reshare without reading, or skim quickly if they do click through. Salacious and alarming stories are more sharable than stories debunking them; Silverman's initial data shows multiple takedowns combined getting just a fraction of the shares as the original rumor. The Banksy hoax was quickly debunked by 12 different sources, and for a while the truth was winning out over the lie, but three days later the fake story has been shared almost three times as often. The Texas quarantine story was shared almost entirely on Facebook — 0.3 percent of shares came from Twitter — which makes sense considering how quickly it would be debunked on a faster platform populated by more news-savvy users. ""Twitter is more where rumors are birthed,"" says Silverman, ""but Facebook is where things absolutely catch fire, in particular when you’re talking about hoaxes and fake news articles."" A change Facebook made earlier this year may have inadvertently made it a better vector for fake news. Facebook added ""trending topics"" in an attempt to highlight important, or at least popular, stories in a near real-time, Twitter-like fashion. In doing so it created new pressure for sites to quickly glom on to whatever topic trending as a way of reaching a wider audience. People have complained that this encourages shoddy, rushed reporting, but the sites best positioned to capitalize on it are the ones that don't need to report at all. I wasn't watching the Ebola section when National Report's campaign ramped up, but I've since seen stories that indicate trending topics will highlight nutty stories (pot can cure Ebola, Obama is infecting Christian's with Ebola to start a new era of liberal darkness) along with legitimate ones. By running fake stories on trending topics, these fly-by-night sites can drastically increase the number of people who see their stories, increasing the odds that their posts will go viral. There are a bunch of them, spammy banner-ad-festooned sites like Big America News, Huzlers, Celebricity, Empire News, and others that run the spectrum from Daily Currant plausibility to National Enquirer fantasy, Ebola outbreaks to Ebola zombies. Some have disclaimers at the bottom of the site saying it's satire, or a mix of news and satire; others bury them so deep they might as well not exist. National Report used to have a satire disclaimer, but at some point deleted it (Snopes took a screenshot), leaving only a single line at the end of a hard-to-find legal page, reading, ""The National Report officially states its purpose as an online portal for general news and commentary from its staff, citizen journalists and other sources, and may include unconfirmed or satirical material."" Ebola is the perfect subject for these sites. ""There’s a lot on Emergent about ISIS and Ebola for the simple reason that it’s human behavior,"" Silverman says. ""When there’s a lot of fear and anxiety and lack of information, or at least lack of understanding, humans try to talk through it, they throw stuff out there, and that births rumors."" Aid workers in Africa dealing with the actual Ebola crisis have also had to contend with dangerous rumors — that Ebola itself is a hoax, that it’s a Western plot, that aid workers will kill anyone infected. Here in the States there is less to fear, but plenty of media ready to capitalize on it, whether through deliberately deceptive ""satire"" sites or irresponsible misinterpretations of science. The idea that Ebola is airborne is proving a particularly persistent rumor as various sites twist statements that such a mutation is not beyond the realm of biological possibility to mean that it’s possible or may have already happened. These rumors would likely be bouncing around anyway. Social media and the incentives it creates, Silverman says, simply work as an accelerant. Obviously it's in Facebook's interest to keep its newsfeed from filling up with garbage, but it's unclear how it could stop the spread of these hoax stories. Facebook is continuing to test ""satire"" labels, but only in the related articles that pop up after you click on a story and return to Facebook. (The Onion summed up people’s response well.) It has attempted to algorithmically weed out misleading clickbait headlines by burying stories that people share without reading, or that people click on and immediately return to Facebook, but it’s hard to imagine a similar filter that would work for posts that deliver exactly the story the headlines promise, albeit a fictional one. Debunking fake stories has a limited effect: a Facebook data science study earlier this year found that putting a link to the rumor-debunking site Snopes into fake stories made people four times more likely to delete their link, but the story continued to spread. ""This suggests that their high virality can overcome the temporary setback dealt by being Snoped,"" wrote the researchers. Maybe the sites will become victims of their own success. The Daily Currant doesn’t seem to get linked to so much anymore, and it seems likely that the National Report’s Ebola spree is on its way to burning itself out. Already you can see the narratives diverging. As the quarantine ends for those in contact with Dunan, the National Report is declaring that Dallas has cancelled Halloween and infected ISIS agents are crossing the border. Hopefully panic will subside to the point that these headlines seem obviously fake to everyone, and attention will go back to the real crisis in Africa. At least until we find something new to panic about. In the meantime, Silverman is busy with Emergent, watching how the rumors spread and get debunked, collecting data for a paper due sometime next year. He’s interested in the dynamics of online rumors generally, but the fake news sites have become an unexpected focus. ""I’m actively now thinking about ways to go after these fake news sites,"" he says. ""We need some way to crawl these sites and figure out which stories are starting to get velocity so we can counteract them, ruin their incentive, prevent them from getting the big hits. But I have no idea what the best way might be. There are so many.""",0.4293779343514565,0.5706220656485435,0.14901794698508816,1989,5.050276520864756,920,6.4576086956521737,0,16,"Culture, Science, Report",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Samsung confirmed to The Verge that Lee was admitted to hospital early Sunday morning and is making a recovery after treatment for acute myocardial infarction, the medical term for a heart attack.  Lee's son has long been expected to take the reins The episode raises questions over how long the 72-year-old Lee, often a source of controversy, will remain at the top of the company he turned into a global power. His only son Lee Jae-yong (also known as Jay Y. Lee) has long been expected to take the reins at some point; the younger Lee is presently vice chairman of Samsung Electronics after serving as COO until 2012. Fluent in English and Japanese, he is considered one of the international faces of Samsung. South Korea's family-run chaebols often pass power down from generation to generation, and Lee Kun-hee himself assumed his following the death of his father, Lee Byung-chull. Lee Kun-hee is not thought to play a major day-to-day role in the running of the company, with three CEOs serving below him — as The Wall Street Journal notes, however, he is still believed to have a final say in major strategic decisions.

""I would not like this broadly known,"" wrote Intel CEO Paul Otellini at the time. ""I don't want to create a paper trail over which we might be sued later,"" wrote Schmidt. But instead of being hauled off to court, the companies hammered out a class-action settlement for pennies on the dollar. Now, one of the lead plantiffs wants to change that. In a rare occurance, one of the named plaintiffs in a class-action lawsuit is opposing a deal. Michael Devine, a former Adobe software developer, is asking Judge Lucy Koh to reject the settlement. He claims his own lawyers went behind his back to secure a ""grossly inadequate"" sum of money for affected employees, one that won't make companies blink at flaunting the law in the future. ""We want our day in court,"" says Devine. ""We want a chance at achieving real justice."" In a letter to Judge Koh (PDF), Devine writes that the $324 million settlement would amount to just one-tenth of the $3 billion that some 64,000 tech workers are estimated to have lost over the course of the gentlemen's agreements. ""If a shoplifter is caught on video stealing a $400 iPad from the Apple Store, would a fair and just resolution be for the shoplifter to pay Apple $40, keep the iPad, and walk away with no record or admission of wrongdoing?"" asks the former Adobe employee. Though Devine stands to make more than most from the current settlement — $20,000 for being a named plaintiff  — he told The New York Times that ethics were at stake. ""The tech industry is ethically challenged. Customers and the government don't fully understand technology and therefore don't know when the law is broken. I'm attracted to the industry for the opportunities for innovation but repulsed by the ease with which folks can cheat and get away with it."" Devine is just one of 64,000 plaintiffs, though. Others would need to join his cause. He's erected a website, Tech Worker Justice, and is currently looking for new lawyers to take up the issue.

But what if we’re all missing the point? What if Apple isn’t buying Beats for a known quantity, but for a product that hasn’t been announced? Imagine if tomorrow, Apple announced a smartwatch. Imagine how Beats could help. Apple’s modus operandi has always been to acquire firms that help it build things. Do you remember SoundJam MP? P.A. Semi? How about C3 Technologies? Probably not, because Apple ground their bones to make its bread. Apple baked their technology and talent into iTunes, the Apple iPhone’s processor, and Apple Maps, respectively. At the time, their ideas were key to a direction Apple wanted to pursue, but their brands were relatively worthless. Beats is all about the brand Yet Beats is all about the brand, as headphone enthusiasts and streaming audio fans will gladly tell you. With its copious engineering resources, Apple could build better headphones itself. And while Apple might indeed want to pursue a streaming music service to compete with Spotify, there’s no indication yet that Beats Music might be able to help do so. As my colleague points out, the service appears to have acquired fewer than 200,000 followers so far, compared to Spotify’s millions, and Apple wouldn’t be able to transfer Beats’ music deals to a streaming service of its own. So what could Apple do with that brand? What everyone seems to be forgetting is that Beats is a fashion company that makes technology you wear.  No matter how obvious it might be that wearable computing is the future, and how much brand value Google has, Google Glass was a fashion disaster when the $1,500 prototype went on sale last year. Getting its own spread in Vogue didn’t stem the concern that wearers looked ridiculously geeky and potentially creepy while wearing them around. Glass has also recently become an occasional symbol of economic inequality, something Apple surely wouldn’t want for a new wearable device of its own. Meanwhile, Beats has spent its entire existence selling expensive, fashionable wearables, ones that are accepted as status symbols without a second thought. Celebrities wear them, and people want them. In Piper Jaffray’s latest ""Taking Stock with Teens"" survey, 46 percent of teens said Beats was the headphone brand they’d like to purchase next. Only 17 percent said they might like a $350 Apple iWatch. Iovine's marketing muscle is undeniable Under the shrewd eye of music mogul Jimmy Iovine, Beats has demonstrated a remarkable knack for being in the right place at the right time with celebrity deals while the entire world was watching. In 2008, Iovine turned a personal connection with LeBron James and his manager Mav Carter into international publicity when James distributed them to every member of the men’s basketball team at the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing. Just this January, Beats managed to inject its brand into a real-life controversy surrounding football star Richard Sherman, garnering priceless attention. One increasingly popular theory is that Apple is entirely after Iovine’s dealmaking prowess: both he and Dr. Dre will reportedly become Apple executives after all is said and done.  Apple doesn't need to buy cool, but cool isn't enough Some have also speculated that Apple is simply buying Beats to replenish its ""cool factor."" That might be partially true. Apple products have gotten a little boring, allowing rivals like Samsung to become increasingly popular. It’s easy to look back to when the iPod was dominant, white earbuds everywhere, and say that Apple is trying to recapture that market. But Apple doesn’t need to buy cool, because Apple’s brand isn’t weak. In fact, it’s at the very top of Interbrand’s Best Global Brands list for 2013, with brand value ahead of Google, Coca-Cola, IBM, and Microsoft. White earbuds are also quite alive and well. Walking the downtown streets of San Francisco and the Caltrain commuter rail, I saw one, two, three, four, eight sets of Beats in all. But I also saw 84 sets of Apple earbuds. Still, you have to remember that consumers didn’t buy those 84 pairs of Apple earbuds: most came free with the purchase of an iPhone or iPod, and many of those iPhones were free on contract or at least an expected biennial purchase. Just because Apple has products in the market now doesn’t mean it can convince people to buy new ones for a premium. That’s where Beats comes in.  What Apple needs to make a wearable product successful isn’t just superb technology, or fantastic manufacturing and distribution. The company’s core strengths aren’t enough. It would need the iWatch to be seen as a fashionable luxury product, one worn by influencers. Beats has those in spades. The streaming music deals may not transfer, but Apple could retain the celebrity cachet. While Beats may not be as universally popular as Apple itself, it could do what one of the world’s most profitable companies might not risk on its own: convince people that a potentially controversial, optional piece of technology is worth spending top dollar to purchase. $3.2 billion may be a small sum when you consider the price of failure. My hunch is that if Apple is buying Beats, it’s because Apple is ready to announce the iWatch. It just needs Dr. Dre and Jimmy Iovine to wear one. Then, Apple would be doing something totally in character, something not surprising at all: buying the last key piece it needs for a technology that could change the world.",0.6414302280990754,0.35856977190092465,0.14736072513959256,961,4.9947970863683659,516,6.0658914728682172,0,0,"Apple, Business, Culture, Entertainment, Tech, Editorial",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

The same is true in the UK and Europe, which are also seeing price bumps of £1 and €1. This is the first price increase that the streaming plan has seen in most regions since its introduction in 2011. Other regions may also be seeing a similar price change.  ""We want to get this done well.""""To continue adding more movies and TV shows and delivering a great streaming experience, we previously announced that we planned to increase our price slightly for new members,"" a Netflix spokesperson says in a statement. ""That increase is happening today."" In the US, the basic streaming plan will now cost $8.99 per month. Netflix CEO Reed Hastings announced that the price hike was coming last month, at the time explaining that it would likely be a one to two dollar increase and that existing members would be grandfathered into their current plans for a ""generous"" period of time. With a two-year price lock, it's hard to argue that Netflix didn't live up to its promise. ""We want to get this done well and make sure we grandfather people cleanly,"" Hastings said last month. Though this is far from as big of a deal as when Netflix split its streaming and DVD services back in 2011, it received a lot of backlash when that happened. Certainly, Netflix is hoping to avoid anything similar from happening once again. Alongside the price increase, Netflix is also introducing a less expensive plan that doesn't allow viewers to watch anything in high definition. For $7.99 per month, the plan will stream video in standard definition only and will limit viewers to playing back one video at a time — the standard plan allows for two, and a more expensive family plan allows for four. That's a pretty major drawback, and it's hard to imagine subscribers not paying the extra dollar each month if they own an HD screen. But Netflix has been testing the plan for at least a few months now, so seemingly it's seen some success.

These buttons pop the user out to a webpage, where they can add more details if they want to, like what they were dissatisfied about. The entire interaction is anonymous — the seller only sees the user's review and receipt contents.  ""How was your experience?"" ""The ability to work things out one-on-one is something really powerful,"" a Square spokesperson told The Verge. ""That [customer] might have gone and put that experience on Yelp or tweeted it to their friends."" Feedback is marketed as a way for any Square seller to add ""instant customer service"" on the fly, but what's more important is how Feedback is priced. The feature is the first subscription service for Square, which ordinarily makes money by taking a small piece of each credit card transaction. Square can't build a big business on top of these tiny margins, many have theorized, but Feedback, priced at $10 per month, operates on top of the credit card system. Merchants who buy Feedback create a new monthly revenue stream where Square's in control of the margins.   When I asked if Square would consider adding more new features as paid subscriptions, a Square spokesperson said ""Yes, definitely."" But perhaps not always. Square recently added inventory management to its feature set, but made the feature free, like all of its point-of-sale and analytics features up to that point. It's not yet clear how Square will choose to price upcoming features — paid or free — but one thing is certain. As Square looks to create new revenue streams that don't rely on tiny interchange fees, it will have to think more about paid services. Square originally marketed itself as a beautiful, functional middleman between companies like Visa and consumers, but as time has gone on, the credit card companies (and other services like PayPal) have caught up. Meanwhile, Square's Wallet payments app was recently shut down, and the company's free Cash person-to-person payments solution is in all likelihood losing money.

Beats Electronics looks set to become part of Apple's vast electronics empire. A flurry of overnight reports were today corroborated by Dr. Dre in an impromptu video where he describes himself as ""the first billionaire in hip hop."" While the music mogul that co-founded Beats back in 2008 doesn't openly confirm his company has been acquired, his words suggest the rumored $3.2 billion deal is now all but completed. Throughout its short history, the Beats brand has always been polarizing: its headphones are as often derided for their exaggerated bass and gaudy looks as they are appreciated by celebrity endorsers. LeBron James, Cesc Fàbregas, and Colin Kaepernick are just some of the myriad sports stars to have associated their names with Beats products, and artists like Pharrell, Lady Gaga, and Nicki Minaj have also added to its notoriety. Here's our look at some of the most significant moments in the company's history so far.   The Beats by Dr. Dre headphones got everything started. Manufactured by Monster Cable, a company that already had a reputation for “premium” products that didn’t match their own hype, this set of cans didn’t inspire the warmest of critical receptions. It was priced at a shade under $350 and relied on a bombastic launch campaign and Dr. Dre’s notoriety to sell. What matters is that it did, helped in no small part by Apple itself, which sold the Beats headphones in its online and retail stores. ""Beats by Dre and Monster have teamed up with pop music and fashion icon Lady Gaga to bring you Heart Beats."" From the moment they were announced, these in-ear buds signaled a manifestly different way for promoting audio gear: they were more about fashion and aspiration than sound quality. Lady Gaga led the way in associating her brand image with that of Beats — something that many others, including luxury carmaker Ferrari and clothes designer Alexander Wang, have since done. Nothing sells as well as exclusivity and Beats made its first foray into embedding its technology in other devices with the limited edition Envy 15. The use of Beats Audio in HP laptops and tablets has since become widespread. Even though the benefits of the actual technology may be dubious, the partnership between HP and Beats has helped enhance the stature of both brands. Jimmy Iovine, the man most often credited as the business genius behind Beats' success, joined the cast of American Idol in 2011 as a mentor to aspiring music stars. Serving that role through 2013, Iovine did much to enlarge his profile and, as a result, that of Beats headphones. He was essentially a walking and talking commercial for the company he co-founded with Dr. Dre, embedded right at the heart of one of America's most popular shows. (FOX / FOX Image Collection / Getty Images) In typically immodest fashion, Beats announced its partnership to implement Beats Audio in the Chrysler 300S as ""bringing the music studio to consumers in cars."" Today, Beats Audio can also be found in Fiat and Dodge models. As with HP, carmakers seem happy to have a recognized brand that can help them up-sell customers onto more expensive equipment packages. HTC was riding high as one of Android’s preeminent phone manufacturers and was looking to make a splashy acquisition. $300 million later, the Taiwanese company owned half of Beats, which nevertheless continued to operate autonomously and maintained its ongoing product partnerships. Dr. Dre and Jimmy Iovine are the dynamic duo of Beats, but for a long time the company was just one half of the formula. Monster Cable collaborated on the design and took care of the production of Beats headphones for five years, however once its exclusive contract ran out, it was dumped unceremoniously by Beats. Monster has since sought to recreate the magic with endorsements from Swizz Beatz, Shaq, Adidas, and others, but it hasn’t been enough to match the continuing growth of the original brand. The prelude to Beats Music, MOG was one of a number of small startups vying to turn music streaming into a commercial success. It was gobbled up by the growing Beats brand in the middle of 2012 , and though it was expected to feature prominently in upcoming HTC phones, the anticipated synergy never really materialized. Depending on what Apple chooses to do with its alleged acquisition of Beats, MOG may now form the core of the next big streaming service. Brand recognition — whether positive or negative — is at the heart of Beats' success, and it's been achieved through a series of aggressive promotional campaigns. One of the emblematic pieces of ambush marketing from the company came during the 2012 London Olympics, when Beats shipped boxes of specially decorated headphones to the hotels where Team GB athletes were staying. This prompted the British Olympic Association to ban the unsanctioned headphones after its Olympians started wearing them and tweeting their approval of the freebies. It wasn't the first Beats product outside the realm of headphones, but the Pill has been easily its most recognizable. Nicki Minaj and Pharrell Williams contributed to its promotion, once again underlining the hip and fashionable image that Beats has consistently sought to project. The Sensation XE was the first in a series of underwhelming HTC phones bearing the Beats Audio branding and software. Any momentum brought about by this partnership quickly fizzled out and almost exactly two years after the XE’s launch, Beats bought out HTC’s share of the company. While Beats had kept growing both its brand awareness and product range, HTC was having to deal with shrinking sales and profits — the two companies were on diametrically opposite trajectories and breaking up just made sense. Paying $265 million for HTC's remaining 25 percent of the company, Beats was valuing itself at a little over $1 billion only a few months before the presently rumored $3.2 billion Apple takeover. Between the release of the original Beats by Dr. Dre headphones and the present rumor of an Apple takeover, the most significant change in Beats' history has been the inauguration of its music streaming service. Beats Music is a highly ambitious, subscription-based service setting out to battle an army of free alternatives. It hasn’t yet convinced a skeptical audience, but in the hands of Apple, it could morph into something altogether more compelling. And hey, having Trent Reznor involved in the project is never a bad thing. It takes a lot to attract Apple’s attention for a potential takeover, and the rumored $3.2 billion deal for Beats would be the Cupertino company’s biggest to date. That’s both in terms of the money being spent and the profile of the acquisition. Such a bold step from CEO Tim Cook would certainly signal Apple sees great value in Beats, whether as a music streaming service and ecosystem or as a pure promotional tool for its products.

It would be a tapestry composed of tiny squares. Each square would represent an app, a game, an experience of some sort, and you’d be able to just reach out and touch it. Or, if you already knew what you wanted, you’d be able to simply speak a name, and have the object of your desire materialize out of thin air — regardless of whether you were using a smartphone or lazing in front of a TV set. That’s the vision Microsoft was building with Windows 8, with Windows Phone, and most intriguingly, with Xbox. That vision is dead. Today, the input device that made it all possible on a television screen — the Kinect — will no longer be bundled with every new Microsoft game console. For now, the $499 Xbox One bundle still exists, but consumers will soon be able to save $100 by sacrificing the cameras and microphones that let the system respond to your gestures and voice commands. ""Xbox One is Kinect. They are not separate systems,"" said Microsoft VP Phil Harrison last August. So much for that.   Kinect hasn't earned its keep In the short-term, possibly even over the long-term, it’s a keen business decision to sell the Xbox without a Kinect packed in. The Xbox One hasn’t been selling as well as the PlayStation 4 despite critically acclaimed exclusive games like Titanfall and Forza Motorsport 5, which suggests that price might have been a factor. Now, the two consoles are on even footing. The new Kinect has also failed to justify the Xbox One’s $100 price premium over the PS4. There’s a dearth of games that actually support the sensor in any meaningful way, and dreadful results from the few games that have. The Kinect also hasn’t been foolproof for navigating the Xbox’s own UI, often failing to recognize commands, and apps haven’t taken enough advantage. Navigating the Netflix interface with voice is a tremendous chore. It’s far faster to pick up a controller. Right now, when the Kinect doesn’t matter, chopping it off makes a lot of sense. If Microsoft can convince more people to buy an Xbox now with a cheaper price, it can guarantee itself a solid footing against the PS4, and sell more games and Xbox Live subscriptions to go with those units. At $399, Microsoft might even make more money on each console, if it’s true that the new Kinect costs quite a bit to manufacture.  The Xbox 360 with optional hard drive. (iFixit) Plus, if the Kinect ever becomes important to the Xbox again, consumers can simply add one to their existing console. We’ve seen this strategy before: the original Xbox 360 shipped with and without a hard drive, but as digital downloads picked up, the drive became an increasingly valuable add-on. For that matter, the original Kinect was a hugely successful standalone product, even though it shipped late in the Xbox 360’s life. It won a Guinness World Record for the fastest-selling gaming peripheral. But there’s a gigantic difference between an optional peripheral and a guaranteed pack-in with every game console. Microsoft promised early adopters and developers alike that every Xbox One would come with a Kinect, and defended that promise time and again. ""As we've said from the very beginning, we believe Kinect is an absolutely integral part of the Xbox One experience,"" UK marketing chief Harvey Eagle reminded us in February.   Well then. We WERE interested in doing a Kinect game.    Those promises sent a clear message that the Kinect would not be chicken and egg. Developers could count on having a guaranteed market for Kinect games and apps, and Xbox One buyers could count on developers building innovative experiences. Now that Microsoft is breaking those promises, that guarantee is gone, and the market for Kinect software will never be the same. The company has suggested that Kinect voice recognition could get better over time by learning from users, but now there will be fewer reasons to keep it plugged in, and a smaller eventual install base. And now that Microsoft has backtracked to such an extreme degree on its original vision, it’s hard to believe any of the company’s other promises about the system’s potential. What chance is there that Microsoft might release a version of the Xbox One that doesn’t include TV functionality? The Kinect served as a heavy-duty IR blaster for controlling your home-entertainment system, so that vision may be in jeopardy as well. How long until the $299 Xbox One without HDMI passthrough appears?  And with Microsoft also no longer requiring Xbox Live Gold subscriptions to use apps like Netflix, Hulu, and Skype — don’t get me wrong, it’s a very welcome move — can we still count on the company helping to foot the bill for games to harness additional horsepower from Microsoft's compute cloud, another promised differentiator? Microsoft's about-face doesn't bode well for apps The biggest casualty, though, might be the as-yet-unrealized potential for the Xbox to be a computer. Time and again, Microsoft hasn’t had a good answer when and how the Xbox One might open up to app developers, even though they were happy to proclaim that it runs Windows underneath. As the company distances itself from anything that isn’t key to the core game-console experience, though, it seems less likely that app developers would want to jump in. When the original Kinect first hit shelves for $129, it was incredible to see the ways the maker community hacked and harnessed the technology for its own ends, and it was exciting to think how apps might evolve on a system where the paradigm was guaranteed.   But now, spurred by the success of the PlayStation 4, Microsoft is sacrificing that future to focus on the present, just as it has already done with the confusing Windows 8. Now that Microsoft is no longer steering consumers towards touch and voice and gesture control, the Metro user interface is mostly just window dressing. But don’t be surprised if you see these ideas again: Microsoft was early to tablets and early to smartphones, after all. There will be colorful tiny squares in your future, and I wouldn’t lay odds that you’ll control them with a joystick. Not after what we’ve seen the Kinect do.",0.635704120338215,0.364295879661785,0.14431889016980656,1075,4.8762790697674419,552,6.0108695652173916,0,0,"Business, Culture, Gaming, Tech, Editorial",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

A police spokesman says three hooded men entered the building and opened fire using Kalashnikov rifles, shotguns, and, according to witnesses, a rocket launcher. The assailants escaped in a getaway car, fled east and abandoned the car, before hijacking another and disappearing, according to a Reuters report. Speaking to French media following the shooting, President Francois Hollande described the incident as ""undoubtedly a terrorist attack,"" adding that France has raised its terror alert to its highest level for the greater Paris area. One suspect, 18-year-old Hamyd Mourad, was arrested early Thursday after turning himself into police at Charleville-Mézières, about 145 miles northeast of Paris. Authorities say he drove the getaway car and reportedly turned himself in after hearing his name on the news. The other two, Said and Chérif Kouachi, 34 and 32, remain at large. French police arrested seven other people connected to the attack early Thursday, though their names have not yet been released. The Kouachi brothers were born in Paris and were on the radar of French intelligence. Chérif was arrested in 2008 after attempting to go to Iraq to fight for al Qaeda. He was sentenced to three years in prison and released. The magazine, Charlie Hebdo, sparked controversy on several occasions for publishing cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed. Its offices were destroyed by a firebomb in 2011 after the magazine named the prophet as its editor-in-chief and featured a caricature of Mohammed on its cover. The last tweet published to Charlie Hebdo's Twitter account included a cartoon drawing of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the purported leader of ISIS, though it is not yet clear whether the attacks are linked to the magazine's treatment of Islam or ISIS. The magazine's offices had been under police protection for years due to threats it received. World leaders denounce attack on the media Hollande and other world leaders have condemned the incident as an attack on the media, with British Prime Minister David Cameron tweeting that the UK stands strong with France in ""defending the freedom of the press."" The White House later condemned it in ""the strongest possible terms."" This week's issue of Charlie Hebdo, released today, features a cover story on French author Michel Houellebecq, whose latest book describes a future Europe that is dominated by Islam. Some have criticized the book for stoking anti-Islam sentiment at a time when fears of ISIS- or al Qaeda-linked attacks were already running high in France. Video from France TV Info show one of the gunmen shouting ""God is great"" in Arabic and proclaiming that they have ""avenged the prophet.""   Aurelien Meunier/Getty Images Thousands gathered Wednesday evening for an impromptu memorial at the Place de la République in Paris, not far from the site of the massacre. Many held signs reading ""Je suis Charlie"" (""I am Charlie""), which has become a slogan of solidarity on social media and across the world. In a televised address Wednesday night, President Hollande declared a national day of mourning that will be observed with a minute of silence at midday Thursday across France. Stéphane ""Charb"" Charbonnier, Charlie Hebdo's editor-in-chief and the cartoonist who drew the Mohammed cartoons, was named in Al Qaeda's most wanted list in 2013. The headline on his latest cartoon chillingly notes that there still haven't been any terrorist attacks in France.

In a new federal lawsuit filed by Universal yesterday in California, the music giant accuses companies like the Centric Group, its affiliate the Keefe Commissary Network, and others of flat out stealing the work of its artists and attempting to skirt copyright issues by calling the finished product a mixtape. ""Such so-called 'mixtapes,' unless authorized by the copyright owner or owner of corresponding state law rights, are nothing more than collections of infringing, piratical compilations of copyrighted or otherwise legally protected sound recordings and copyrighted musical compositions,"" says the complaint, which was spotted by The Hollywood Reporter.

""Performances by such legendary artists as James Brown, Eminem, the Jackson Five, LL Cool J, Marvin Gaye, and Stevie Wonder, among many others,"" Universal says. Also included are acts like Public Enemy, 2Pac, and Dr. Dre, which the record companies say are ""just a small sampling"" of the music it found on the tapes. In many cases, it's not the care packages companies producing these mixtapes, the lawsuit claims. Instead, it's allegedly the work of a Pennsylvania-based company called Ari's Mixtapes, a company that sells most of its ""official mixtapes"" for $5.99 through its site.

""We see no evidence that the drones contribute to a more secure border,"" said DHS Inspector General John Roth in a statement, ""and there is no reason to invest additional taxpayer funds at this time.""

""We're going to circulate it to the commissioners on February 5th and vote on it February 26th,"" Wheeler told CEA President Gary Shapiro in a public interview at CES. Wheeler did not specifically say whether the commission was selecting a hybrid approach or reclassification of broadband as a utility, but he did speak highly of Title II's regulatory abilities. In November, President Obama urged the FCC to classify internet traffic under Title II, although Wheeler has declined to explicitly endorse the proposal.  ""How do you make sure that that pathway stays open?"" ""I was standing at one of the [CES] booths ... there was an ethernet port in their router that has to go into the router of the ISP, who may offer — and in this case was offering — a competitive service,"" Wheeler said. ""How do you make sure that that pathway stays open ... and make sure that the ISP has an opportunity to get a fair return on investment?"" In response to questions from Shapiro about Title II, Wheeler spoke about the need to find a balance between the allowance for innovation and then need to incentivize the ISPs' continued investment in broadband. He also continued to suggest that the commission isn't about to hand the ISPs everything that they want. ""When the president came out ... there was an effort made to say Wheeler and the president are pulling in opposite directions on this,"" Wheeler said. ""But that wasn't exactly the reality because we're both pulling in the same directions, which is no blocking, no throttling of applications, and transparency about how we get there."" Wheeler spoke about the success of regulating the wireless industry under Title II-style regulations but removing some of the harsher restrictions — much like what Obama proposed. At the same time, Wheeler continued to refer to his prior remarks that, in some instance, prioritization may be appropriate. Previously, the commission has said that something like an emergency health alert may deserve prioritization. ""There are instances where priority makes a whole heck of a lot of sense,"" Wheeler said. However, he sees the ability to buy into prioritization as a different story. Wheeler by no means drew the line for what is and isn't appropriate, but the commission's proposal next month will have to — even if that's saying no prioritization, period. The FCC has said over the past few months that it has been exploring a hybrid approach to protecting net neutrality. It's believed that this approach would use strict, utility-like Title II regulation on the parts of the internet that connect content providers, but the approach wouldn't apply that regulation to the final stretch of the internet that connects to consumers' homes. There, a lighter regulation would be used that would still allow prioritized fast lanes to be sold. The FCC initially began exploring that approach at the suggestion of the court that struck down its last net neutrality rules. If it chooses to go in this direction, it would mean that the FCC will have to decide when it is ""commercially reasonable"" to allow a fast lane. Critics of the plan would argue that there really is no point at which it is reasonable, while ISPs would love to have that level of flexibility to charge consumers more for services. It's not yet clear exactly where the commission comes down, but we should find out soon. ""You'll notice that I have not addressed any of the specifics,"" Wheeler said, trying to temper his remarks. ""You have to wait until February to see the specifics."" Update January 7th, 4:21PM PT: this story has been updated to emphasize that Wheeler's later remarks spoke quite favorably of Title II, rather than suggesting that the commission is still interested in a hybrid approach.",0.5547944949780039,0.4452055050219961,0.24741061687265387,653,4.9402756508422661,344,6.0639534883720927,0,0,"Policy & Law, US & World",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

As the Colombian army’s communications expert watched the grainy video again, he saw kidnapped soldiers chained up inside barbed-wire pens in a hostage camp deep in the jungle, guarded by armed FARC guerillas. Some had been hostages for more than 10 years, and many suffered from a grim, flesh-eating disease caused by insect bites. It was 2010, and the straight-talking Espejo was close to retirement after 22 years of military service. But he couldn’t stand the thought of quitting with men left behind enemy lines. He needed an idea, and when he needed an idea, he always went to one man. Juan Carlos Ortiz was dunking his kids in the pool at his home in Coconut Grove, Miami, when he got the call from Colonel Espejo. With his easy charm and seemingly natural talent for creating clever commercials, the 42-year-old advertising executive had earned himself a Don Draper-like reputation in Colombia. The ambitious Ortiz had shot to fame at the Colombian office of Leo Burnett — the legendary ad agency behind Tony the Tiger — where he created an anti-drug TV spot for the Colombian President’s Office. The ad showed an addict on a bus mistaking a fellow passenger’s dandruff for cocaine and snorting it up his nose. It made Ortiz the first Colombian to win a gold Lion at Cannes, the advertising industry’s Oscars. He returned to Bogotá a national hero and received a commendation from the nation’s first lady.  The success of his ad also brought threats from FARC guerillas, who relied, in part, on the cocaine market to fund their decades-old campaign against the government. ""I had gone against their objectives with my anti-cocaine commercial,"" he remembers. ""They offered me the opportunity of paying them in exchange for my life."" Deeply concerned by threatening letters and phone calls, Ortiz bought a bulletproof car for his family, and even assisted police in a sting operation to catch his blackmailers. But the threats persisted, and fearing for his safety, his employer urgently transferred Ortiz to its New York office. He took his family with him. A high-profile move to rival ad agency DDB in Miami followed, but Ortiz could never forget his enmity toward the FARC. He became the go-to guy for the Colombian army’s more bizarre requests in their battle against the guerillas. On the telephone, Colonel Espejo explained that he urgently needed to get a message to the captured Colombian soldiers: help was coming. Daring commando missions were taking place throughout the region, including Operation Chameleon — a sixth-month operation that involved 300 government soldiers and secret raids. Because the FARC shoots hostages dead at the first sight of a military invasion, Espejo had to convey to the captives to be ready to escape. How do you reach soldiers held under 24-hour armed guard in deeply rural territory? Juan Carlos Ortiz’s mind raced between ideas: Sky-writing? Aid parcels containing secret messages? Ortiz had designed unorthodox campaigns to battle the FARC before. In 2008, he dreamed up an operation to persuade pregnant female guerrillas to defect: the army air-dropped 7 million pacifiers into the jungle with a message encouraging rebels to return to civilization. The operation involved seven helicopters, three airplanes, 960 flight hours, 17,800 gallons of fuel, and 72 soldiers flying twice a week for four months. During the holidays, the army illuminated giant Christmas trees across the jungle to remind guerrillas what they were missing. They also wrote messages promoting peace on soccer balls and floated them down the river toward the rebel encampments. But this operation would be far more challenging. They had to create a message that could be understood by the hostages, but remain invisible to their captors. They needed to give the hostages hope, and encourage any soldiers harboring plans of escape that now was the time. Ortiz agreed to participate, and boarded the next plane to Bogotá. The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, emerged in the 1960s as a group of armed Communist peasants opposing the government and demanding labor reforms. This followed a period in Colombian history known as ""La Violencia,"" when fighting between the Liberal and Conservative parties resulted in 300,000 deaths. Driven deep into the jungle by a 1964 military bombing campaign, the FARC built up their strength and numbers. By 2010 the FARC had an estimated 8,000 to 10,000 members, according to the International Crisis Group. By the time that the FARC and the Colombian government announced a ceasefire at the end of last year, their civil war had become one of the longest-running and bloodiest in the world. The FARC, Latin America’s oldest surviving left-wing insurgency, has been labeled a terrorist group by the US State Department and has a long history of kidnapping to help finance its operations. In the past decade, 6,880 people have been snatched in Colombia and held for ransom — some for as long as 18 years. Five hundred of the hostages are either involved with the military or politics. While the FARC prefer to kidnap Americans for money, prominent Colombian prisoners can be valuable political leverage. Hostages’ accounts of their time in captivity are harrowing: Sgt. Jose Libardo Forero was one of Colombia’s ""forgotten"" hostages, held by the FARC for nearly 13 years. After his release, Forero spoke of relieving his mental anguish by bonding with jungle animals and one pet pig he called Josefo, whom he got hooked on coffee. Colombian politician Ingrid Betancourt, held for six years, recalled being chained to a tree by her neck. Ortiz arrived at the Bogotá headquarters of the DDB advertising agency. The modern building features floor-to-ceiling windows that boast panoramic views of the traffic-choked Colombian capital, but keep out the symphony of car horns playing below. That day he was joined by his team of creative minds: Rodrigo Bolivar, Alfonso Diaz, Mario León, and Luis Castilla, the leading lights of Colombia’s advertising industry. Together with Colonel Espejo, they brainstormed ways to get a message to the hostages. Sending messages directly to hostages is often impossible and not found in the guidebook of any law enforcement or military agency, says Christopher Voss, the FBI’s lead international kidnapping negotiator from 2003 to 2007. Now the owner of the negotiation firm Black Swan Group, Voss says: ""When you send a message to a hostage, you have to assume the hostage takers are seeing it too."" Gary Noesher is a former Chief Negotiator for the FBI who spent 23 years rescuing hostages and has dealt directly with the FARC. He says that sending sensitive messages meant solely for hostages is ""incredibly risky."" Colonel Espejo’s case reminds him of a siege at the Japanese ambassador’s mansion in Lima, Peru, in December 1996. Noesher was on the team tasked with saving 72 hostages. ""Secret messages were transmitted through the garbage. We received word that terrorists played indoor soccer in the living room, and a bomb was placed underneath the room and detonated,"" Noesher says. ""That is the only time I can remember covert messages sent to hostages."" Noesher won’t say exactly how the messages were sent, but adds: ""Food and water were going into the embassy. All I can say is… messages were transmitted."" All of the militants were killed, along with two commandos and one hostage. Col. Espejo ran the brainstorming session with the efficiency of a military operation. He explained that FARC guerrillas usually allow hostages access to radios; it relieves the tedium of long hikes through the Colombian jungle and keeps their minds from escape. Communicating with hostages via radio is a years-old practice in Colombia. The show ""Voices of Kidnapping"" on Bogota’s Caracol Radio is dedicated to victims’ families who send messages to their loved ones via special call-ins. Creator Herbin Hoyos Medina came up with the idea in 1994, after he was kidnapped for 17 days. He now broadcasts the show from Madrid, giving families 30-second slots to send messages. Ortiz considered hiding a message in a radio commercial, perhaps hidden in the fine print spoken quickly at the end. Then Diaz, the creative director, suggested using code. What about código Morse, he said — Morse code.  It wouldn’t be the first time Morse code was used in a hostage situation; in 1977, one of 52 hostages held captive by South-Moluccan gunmen on a Dutch train managed to transmit the message ""get us out of here,"" using sunlight and a hand mirror. Then there was Jeremiah Andrew Denton Jr., a United States Navy rear admiral who spent almost eight years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam, four of those in solitary confinement. In a forced North Vietnamese television interview in 1966, Denton ingeniously used Morse code to communicate with American Intelligence by blinking his eyes to spell out ""T-O-R-T-U-R-E"". ""It was a eureka moment! We thought about hiding the Morse code in an advert,"" says Ortiz. ""Then we thought, how about a song?"" As a young man, Ortiz was a musician, but his career never took off. The idea of producing a hit song appealed to him. Ortiz pitched the Colonel a plan as if he were pitching a commercial to Heinz or Coca-Cola. The Colonel stroked his chin. Espejo liked the code idea, because he knew that many soldiers — especially in the communications departments — were taught Morse code in their basic training. Furthermore, Espejo reasoned, ""The FARC were peasants from the fields, they wouldn’t know [Morse]."" It was a longshot, but if the team could disguise the telltale dot-dot-dash signals in a song, there was a chance the soldiers would hear the message. Radio Bemba is a small recording studio with six electric guitars on the wall where musicians write catchy commercial jingles. If the DDB agency is in Bogotá’s ""Manhattan,"" Radio Bemba is in the city’s ""Brooklyn,"" sharing its front door with an architecture company in a 50-year-old building on an edgy street.Word quickly got around the studio that the military wanted to produce a song so popular it would enterr the ""Lista 40"" — Colombia’s Billboard charts. Producer Carlos Portela, 34, thought they were nuts. ""But they were deadly serious, and explained it was a secret project,"" says Portela, who wears an eyebrow ring and produces music for beer commercials. ""Obviously we had never worked with Morse code before. But they were very specific about what they wanted. They needed to know if we could hide their message in a song, so that nobody would detect it unless they knew Morse code."" The team began experimenting with Morse code using various percussion instruments and a keyboard. They learned that operators skilled in Morse code can often read the signals at a rate of 40 words per minute — but played that fast, the beat would sound like a European Dance track. ""We discovered the magic number was 20,"" says Portela. ""You can fit approximately 20 Morse code words into a piece of music the length of a chorus, and it sounds okay."" With the help of a military policeman skilled in Morse, they coded the message: ""19 people rescued. You are next. Don’t lose hope."" It was a signal to boost morale and indicate that help was nearby. Portela wrote the song and the lyrics with composer Amaury Hernandez, creating a thinly-veiled ballad about life as a hostage: ""In the middle of the night / Thinking about what I love the most / I feel the need to sing… About how much I miss them."" He even added the lyric, ""Listen to this message, brother,"" just before the coded message kicks in. The code sounds like a brief synth interlude just after the chorus. Portela says they played with the Morse code using Reason software, which gives each audio channel or instrument its own dedicated track. With a separate visual lane for certain elements, it was possible to match the code to the beat of the song — and, crucially, blend it in. Hiding the Morse code took weeks, with constant back-and-forth with Col. Espejo and the military to make sure their men could understand the message. ""It was difficult because Morse code is not a musical beat. Sometimes it was too obvious,"" says Portela. ""Other times the code was not understood. And we had to hide it three times in the song to make sure the message was received."" Finally, in September 2010, the song was mastered. They titled it ""Better Days,"" performed by session artists Natalia Gutierrez Y Angelo, fairly anonymous background musicians who’d worked on other jingles at the studio. Ortiz thought it was a masterpiece. ""When I first listened, I thought it was a song of freedom,"" he says.  With the song completed, they had to get it on the airwaves. Commercial Colombian stations largely only played hits by famous artists like Coldplay and Shakira. Luckily, says Col. Espejo, in many of the jungle areas where the hostages were held, all the radio stations were controlled by the government. ""The hostages were listening to our own stations, so we made sure the song was played,"" he says. ""The code message said, ‘you’re next’ because the hostages thought if they ran away, they would die in the jungle. We let them know that our troops were nearby.’"" At that time, active commando missions were underway, placing troops undercover in FARC-controlled areas. Former hostage Major General Luis Mendieta Ovalle Herlindo helped the operation by appearing on live television and making an appeal directly to the guerillas. Herlindo, who escaped in one of the secretive commando-led escapes during ""Operation Chameleon,"" said: ""This message is for members of the FARC. For those being held captive without a radio. Please, give them radio."" Though it might seem that this gave the game away, to Colombians it sounded like an appeal for hostages to be able to hear the voices of their families, who call in to radio shows. The song was played on over 130 small stations and heard by 3 million people. Though most Colombians in major cities would not even recognize the song, it became popular in the rural areas controlled by the FARC. By December 2010, ""Better Days"" was echoing across the jungle. And the plan worked. ""We know of hostages who heard the message and were able to escape and provide information that led to the release of more hostages,"" says Colonel Espejo. ""Better Days""  [VERSE 1] In the middle of the night Thinking about what I love the most I feel the need to sing What my heart has to give I talk about those I love About how much I miss them I talk about pride and strength Which beat inside my heart [CHORUS] A new dawn singing this message From my heart Although I'm tied up and alone I feel as if I'm by your side Listen to this message brother [MORSE MESSAGE] 19 people rescued. You’re next. Don’t lose hope [VERSE 2] I want to keep on fighting For my friends, my family, my children We will soon see each other again I'm sure better days are coming [CHORUS x 2] Later in December 2010, the FARC announced its plans to release five more hostages as a humanitarian gesture, including a police major, two military service members, and two politicians; two months later, Major Guillermo Solorzano, 35, and Corporal Salin Sanmiguel, 28, were released back to their families; and in the spring of 2012, the last 10 police and military hostages — some of whom had spent 14 years in captivity — were released and flown in a Brazilian military helicopter to safety. Colonel Espejo watched the hostages on TV, waving and punching the air with delight as they stepped off a helicopter in Villavicencio. At the country’s presidential palace, the president, Juan Manuel Santos, said: ""Welcome to liberty, soldiers and policemen of Colombia. Freedom has been very delayed, but now it is yours, to the delight of the whole country."" One former hostage was able to confirm the song’s effectiveness, according to Col. Espejo. He told Ortiz of a clandestine operation that resulted in the release of Private Joshua Alvarez. In his military psychological evaluation, Col. Espejo says that the soldier spoke of hearing ""the code hidden in the song,"" and revealed how the message was passed from soldier to soldier. The song was even enjoyed by the FARC, who were oblivious to its secret message. Back home in his village in western Nariño, Alvarez was greeted with a hero’s welcome, including fireworks and banners. ""It makes me very happy to think of the hostages listening to our song,"" Ortiz says. Ortiz still keeps in touch with Col. Espejo, who retired from the military and now works as a journalist. Col. Espejo wrote the book El Gran Cartel, an investigation into the FARC’s finances. Ortiz continues to travel between Colombia, New York, and Miami, where he has created commercials for Rice Krispies and Volkswagen. He’s earned a place in the American Advertising Federation’s Hall of Fame, and on a top 10 list of ""exceptional Colombians."" On the wall of Ortiz’s Miami office there’s a photo of him celebrating his gold Lion for the dandruff cocaine ad in 2000, wildly waving a Colombian flag on stage. He recalls how he persuaded a local tailor in Cannes to fashion him a Colombian flag on the morning of the awards. Receiving that award should have been the greatest moment of his life, he says, but that victory was marred by the FARC and their threats. ""One moment, I was the king of the world,"" he says ruefully, ""the next… just another Colombian victim of the terrorists. Being able to help the military with the code project was my way of helping them fight."" The army agreed to declassify ""The Code"" operation in 2011 and allowed the song to be entered into the Cannes Lions. ""Better Days"" earned Ortiz his second gold Lion. ""This time,"" he says, ""we enjoyed it.""

The ban was originally put into place by former Mayor Michael Bloomberg under the guise that cell phones were not only a distraction to students, but also a potential privacy issue for schools if students were to use them to take illicit photographs. A lot has changed since 2006, including phones In a speech today, cuurent New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said that times have changed quite a bit since the idea was hatched, and that the ban ultimately created more issues it was originally designed to solve. That includes spurring a cottage industry of rental lockers outside of schools where students could pay to safely store their phones, racking up charges that averaged an extra $180 a year. Moreover, de Blasio said it made it extremely difficult for parents to get in touch with their kids. ""We used to have a policy that didn't understand the reality of parents,"" de Blasio said. ""We're now going to make this a policy that works with parents so they can do their most important job.""   The new policy requires approval from the city's panel for educational policy next month, and would go into effect on March 2nd if approved. As part of the change, the city says schools would be able to create localized sets of rules about phone use on both school grounds and in classrooms, with the stipulation that would be extra training to identify and prevent cyberbullying.

Crawford's target is zero-rating, a system that lets content companies buy out specific portions of a given user's data plan, offering effectively free data as long as you're using the right apps. Under this system, Google might pay AT&T to make YouTube exempt from any data caps, giving AT&T customers the chance to go wild with video consumption, but also shutting smaller competitors like Vimeo out of the picture entirely. As Crawford points out, that's not how net neutrality works. Once carriers start discriminating between different services and making money off it, the internet may not stay open very long. The practice has already been banned in a number of countries, but new plans from AT&T and Sprint show the idea is alive and well in the US, with potentially troubling consequences for anyone trying to compete with a major web company. ""Can you imagine trying to launch a competitor to Facebook in a country where most of your potential customers will have to pay data charges for your service—while the incumbent Facebook is exempt?""

According to Comey, the Guardians of Peace ""got sloppy"" when masking their IP addresses, allowing FBI researchers to determine that emails and other messages to Sony employees were originating from internet connections used exclusively by North Korea. This evidence had been hinted at in a previous Wall Street Journal article, but has never been publicly attributed. ""We know who hacked Sony. It was the North Koreans."" Web access in North Korea is extremely limited and connections are almost exclusively controlled by the government, which makes it unlikely a third party would be able to hijack a North Korean IP without the government's explicit consent. ""We know who hacked Sony. It was the North Koreans,"" Comey told the audience. ""I have very high confidence about this attribution."" The FBI publicly attributed the Sony hack to North Korea last month, based on similarities in the attack methods and physical infrastructure to previous attacks that had been attributed to North Korea. The bureau cited further evidence that could not be made public, which has been the subject of intense speculation in the weeks since. In the wake of the announcement, many have criticized the bureau's public evidence as flimsy, while others have questioned whether the FBI simply got the attribution wrong. It's a particularly serious issue now that the US has levied sanctions against the North Korea in response to the hack. North Korea has maintained its innocence, although it has applauded the actions of the hackers on a number of occasions. Researchers have speculated that NSA tools like XKeyscore could also have been used to track leaked data across the network, but kept secret because of the classified nature of the programs involved. In many cases, the leaked files took hours to fully seed, giving officials ample time to trace the source, and recently leaked NSA documents described similar file-tracking operations as ""trivial."" Still, Comey and others seem determined to hold North Korea accountable for the attack on Sony. President Obama has described the sanctions against North Korea as only the first aspect of the government's retaliation, suggesting further measures, public or otherwise, may still be in the works. Speaking at the same conference this morning, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper called the Sony hack ""the most serious cyberattack ever made against US interests.""",0.5066429949250498,0.4933570050749502,0.8558386592405891,425,5.3200000000000003,250,6.3639999999999999,0,0,"US & World, National Security",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

The good news is that Microsoft has made the process surprisingly painless. Seriously, you just click a couple buttons and everything should be set. But the bad news is that you may not be able to update this week, even though Windows 10 is coming out. Still, there may be plenty you can do to prepare. For all of the details, keep on reading.  Read next: Our Windows 10 review. If you already own a computer running Windows 7 or Windows 8.1, then Windows 10 is going to be completely free — and updating should be really easy. Just make sure you don't put it off too long: if you don't update within a year from Wednesday, you'll have to pay for it. If your version of Windows is as up to date as it can be, you should see that a Windows icon has appeared in your task bar. (If you don’t see it by Wednesday, Microsoft has some unfortunately complex instructions on how to make it show up.) Clicking on the icon will open up Microsoft's Get Windows 10 app, which allows you to sign up to download the new OS and determine if your computer is compatible. Enter your email address into the system, and from there you're pretty much set. Now you just have to wait.   Chances are good that you won't actually be able to download and install Windows 10 immediately. Microsoft is rolling the OS out slowly to make sure that it has time to clean up any bugs that it discovers, so you may end up waiting weeks or more before you're given the go ahead to install it. Once you are, Microsoft will download Windows 10 to your computer and then notify you with a pop up that it's ready to install. Then it's time to get going. If you don't see an icon for the Get Windows 10 app in your task bar, then there's a good chance you need to take care of some other updates first. If you're running Windows 7, make sure that you've updated all the way to Service Pack 1. To do that, go to the Start menu and search for Windows Update. If you're running Windows 8, you'll have to bump it up to 8.1. To do that, click the Store tile on the Start screen; inside the store, you should see an icon for the update. Once you're on the latest version of either operation system, the Get Windows 10 app should be available, and you'll be able to grab the free update. If you're running Windows Vista or XP (...you're not still on ME, are you?), then you'll have to pay to update to Windows 10. It costs $119 for Windows 10 Home and $199 for Windows 10 Pro, but you'll want to take more into consideration than just the price. Windows 10 has the same system requirements as Windows 7 and 8, but those requirements are still substantially higher than those for earlier versions of the OS. Make sure that your computer meets these minimums before updating: Processor: 1GHz RAM: 1GB for 32-bit or 2GB for 64-bit Storage: 16GB for 32-bit or 20GB for 64-bit Graphics support: DirectX 9 or later with WDDM 1.0 driver Display: 800 x 600 resolution Even if you do meet those requirements, you may still want to think about getting Windows 10 another way: by buying a new PC. You can buy a new laptop for the same price as you can buy Windows 10 Pro, which is worth keeping in mind. There's some bad news: you've been stranded. Windows RT machines aren't being updated to Windows 10. Microsoft is promising some kind of update in September, but it hasn't said what to expect just yet. This first step isn't mandatory, but it's a good idea: back up your computer. If you can, make sure that all of your most important files are saved outside of your PC. More than likely you aren't going to need this, but it's better to have it in the event that something goes wrong. Once Windows 10 starts installing, you're almost set. Depending on how new your computer is, this could take anywhere from 20 minutes to an hour or longer, but there isn't that much for you to do aside from click ""Next"" a few times. Click Next, check off some settings, and you're basically good to go Eventually, the Windows 10 installer will ask you to configure some settings. It'll offer you the option to customize the settings or to choose what Microsoft calls ""express settings."" We'd recommend clicking customize — it won't take more than a couple minutes longer, and there are some options that you may want to change. That includes how Windows handles location privacy, ad tracking, browser settings, and whether or not your computer automatically connects to open hotspots. Once you're through that, the installer will finish setting things up and bring you to the desktop. From there, you're very nearly good to go. You'll want to run Windows Update one final time to make sure that you aren't missing any recent updates or drivers specific to your computer. And that's it — once you're sure everything's up to date, you're good to go: Ask Cortana a question. Stare at the beauty of the Start menu. Annotate something in Edge. And enjoy the rest of the new but familiar world that is Windows 10.

The Galaxy S6, HTC One M9, LG G4, and the new Moto X Style (or Moto X Pure Edition, if you live in the US) are all universally fast, well built, and (for the most part) have better-designed software than ever. That leaves the camera as the main sticking point, and luckily we've seen great progress from Samsung and LG (HTC: not so much). The last of the big four Android makers to check in is Motorola. And it's checking in with some very big talk about its camera quality. At today's event, Motorola's head of design, Jim Wicks, laid his cards on the table in no uncertain terms: ""We're extremely excited about the camera. It's the best we've ever built and one of the best in the world."" Later, another executive went so far as to cite an article here at The Verge about how the camera is the main thing that matters. And Motorola even handed the Moto X Style to a couple of camera sites to review. So how'd it turn out? Pretty good! If you're the sort of person who puts a lot of stock in quantitative analysis of camera performance, DxOMark has charts aplenty that detail how the Moto X Style performed in its tests. The summation is a score of 83, which places it behind the Galaxy S6 Edge and Note 4, but above the iPhone 6 Plus. But these kinds of numbers are hard to equate with real-world experience — especially the ""just give me a quick photo without hassle"" kind of experience most people demand from their smartphones. It's an area where Apple has often excelled and Android has had trouble. The difference can come down to a wide variety of factors, many of which boil down to software choices and post-processing. Luckily, DPReview got a chance to take some sample photos, a couple of which are reproduced below. (Head to DPReview for the full images and the breakdown of their thoughts.)      The gist is this: ""Image detail in bright light is impressive, and in lower light a well-balanced approach to noise reduction means that a lot of detail is preserved while noise isn't getting too intrusive,"" according to DPReview. That seems like a fair assessment, but I'm not quite ready to give the Moto X Style full marks just yet. For one, it's just too early to say. It appears like neither site has had significant time with the Moto X Style, especially in the real world with moving objects (like kids). For another, my own hands-on time with the Moto X Style today has left me optimistic, but with a small shadow of caution. The question is low-light performance. The Moto X Style has a 21-megapixel sensor, and basic optics will tell you that the more pixels there are, the smaller they are. When the pixels get smaller, low-light performance tends to suffer. (That's the defining principle of HTC's bet on low-megapixel ""ultrapixel"" sensors.) At its event today, Motorola set up three booths to show off its camera sensors, including its wide-angle selfie camera, HDR mode on the Moto G, and lastly its low-light performance. It's there where I saw what could be a warning sign. The setup was designed to compare the Moto X Style's camera performance with the Galaxy S6. With phones mounted on tripods, the Moto rep took a shot with flash to show the differences. Sure enough, the S6 didn't seem to perform as well. There was a purple haze around the tungsten lightbulb in the scene, and the white balance was a little bit off compared to the Moto X Style. That's all good news! The bad news for the Moto X Style is that when I took the shots myself without the flash, it exhibited a lot more noise. The ostensibly flat white wall was mottled with tell-tale pixels. It's possible (actually likely) that the difference came down to Samsung more aggressively post-processing that noise out — but whatever the cause, the noise was there. The bar for camera performance on a flagship phone has been raised significantly in the past year, and by all indications the Moto X Style has cleared it. But whether it lives up to Motorola's vaunted claims still remains to be seen. As I said, I'm optimistic based on what I've seen and on what DPReview and DXoMark say — but we won't know for sure until we've seen (and done) more testing.",0.6468454071463624,0.3531545928536376,0.1634006792990057,788,4.5774111675126905,442,5.5701357466063346,1,6,"Google, Tech, Hands-on",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Verge reader Luke M. alerted us to Facebook's new profile tags feature, and the company confirmed it was testing them out with the following statement: ""Profile tags are a creative tool that lets you and your friends add tags to your profile to highlight the things that describe you and what you're into."" Created as part of an internal Facebook hackathon, the new feature will let you add tags to your own profile, or let your friends add tags for you, which you must approve before they become publicly visible. Tags are free-form, which means you can type in pretty much whatever you want, even including emojis. Designer? Thinker? Tags let you describe what you're into Once the feature is rolled out to everyone, friends can add tags by going to your profile and tagging you using words or phrases that describe you, or what you do (""happy camper"", ""thinker"", ""graphic artist,"" etc.) You'll receive a notification, prompting you to accept or decline your tags. If you accept, the tags become visible to everyone; if you decline, the tags disappear. Or you could just ignore the notification (cough, just like you do with certain friend requests), and the tags will remain pending, visible only to you and the friend who tagged you. Once approved, other friends can ""like"" your tags, which will appear in descending order by the number of likes.   With this new feature, Facebook is both pulling features from other sites but also adding yet another layer to an already complex experience — the social network seems to want to be your one stop-shop for connecting with friends, catching up on news, watching videos, and, with this latest update, maybe even connecting with strangers who have similar interests.

This gear usually includes goggles and a face mask, but staffers reportedly stuck to their scrubs and gloves while waiting for Duncan's Ebola test results. This delay may have exposed dozens of hospital staffers to Ebola, reports Dallas News. It may also explain why two healthcare workers who were caring for Duncan, the first person diagnosed with Ebola in the US, have now been diagnosed with the disease. They only wore scrubs and gloves while waiting for Duncan's test results Duncan, a Liberian citizen who died on 8 October, was admitted to the hospital in Dallas on 28 September because of a suspected Ebola infection. Upon his admission, his doctors made him take a blood test that didn't return results until 30 September. During that time, Duncan's caregivers didn't wear protective gear recommended by the CDC. Eventually, they were offered face masks and shields, reports the CDC, but the guidelines they were given kept changing. ""[Hospital officials] kept adding more protective equipment as the patient [Duncan] deteriorated. They had masks first, then face shields, then the positive-pressure respirator,"" Pierre Rollin, a CDC epidemiologist, told The Washington Post. Then, ""they added a second pair of gloves"" — a practice that CDC director Tom Frieden doesn't recommend because wearing two pairs make them harder to remove. This raises the likelihood that more hospital workers will be diagnosed with Ebola in the coming days. According to hospital officials, a total of 70 hospital workers cared for Duncan before his death, but they have yet to reveal how many were involved in treating Duncan during those first two days. Yesterday, the CDC announced new guidelines for protective equipment. These include wearing a hood that covers the neck area — a part of the body that was previously exposed. The CDC has also sent a team to Dallas to oversee the care of Nina Pham, the 26-year-old nurse that marked the first case of Ebola transmission in the US, as well as the treatment of an unidentified female hospital worker who's infection was revealed earlier this morning. 70 hospital workers cared for Duncan before his death So far, the Ebola outbreak has been concentrated in three African countries: Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. A total of 8,400 have been infected, and more than 4,000 have died.

That’s especially exciting because those patients had failed all conventional treatments.Today’s report, in the New England Journal of Medicine, is an extension of data presented last year at the American Society of Hematology’s annual meeting. Not all of the remissions lasted, the report showed. Nineteen patients in the study remain in remission 2 to 24 months later, and 15 of them didn’t need any additional treatment. Seven patients relapsed between 6 months and 9 months after their infusion; those included three people whose cancers spread beyond the blood cells the new treatment targets. Five patients left the study for alternative therapy. The numbers are remarkable because these patients had cancer return as many as four times before they joined the study, including some whose cancer had returned after stem cell transplants, said Carl June, the leader of the research team and an immunotherapist at the University of Pennsylvania. In other words, these people were the sickest of the sick.  ""Initially, we didn’t know if we were just lucky with the first patients,"" June says. The group’s first patient, a 9-year-old named Emily Whitehead was treated when she was 6. Shehas remained cancer-free without any further intervention for more than 2 years and was at a fundraising bike ride with June last weekend, where $1.9 million was raised to continue the research. ""She’s become sort of a legend,"" June says. Living without B cells isn't perfect, but it's better than dying of cancer The best comparison to the group's results are those for Novartis's Gleevec, which aided 90 to 98 percent of patients in early trials, June says. It is now approved for 10 kinds of cancer. Unlike this method, however, patients must take the Gleevec pill every day. June's treatment regimen requires just one dose.For this method, the researchers harvest a patient’s T cells using a process like blood transfusion. Then the lab at the University of Pennsylvania’s Clinical Cell and Vaccine Production Facility does a gene transfer, to teach the T cells to target a protein found on the surface of B cells, another type of blood cell that’s affected in leukemia. The T cells are then transplanted back into the patient, where they hunt and kill anything with the protein attached to it. That means all B cells, not just the cancerous ones, are killed. Tests of all treated patients showed that their normal B cells had been killed along with the tumors. Because B cells are responsible for creating antibodies, which hunt any viruses or bacteria circulating in the blood stream, the solution isn’t ideal; patients usually receive immunoglobulin replacement to help boost their immune systems to healthy levels.""It's striking how similar their response rate is to ours."" Living without B cells isn’t perfect, but it’s better than dying of cancer, says Michel Sadelain, an immunologist at Memorial Sloan-Kettering who wasn’t involved in today’s study. He’s also doing research on the designer T cells, using a different technique for programming and growing the modified cells. His group’s response rate was 88 percent in a group of adults with a different type of leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Most of today’s patients were between 5 and 22 years old, and they all had acute lymphoblastic leukemia.""It’s striking how similar their response rate is to ours,"" Sadelain says. ""Those numbers are almost the same, but coming from different hands, at different centers, in different patient populations. It probably speaks to the power of the approach.""Because the numbers are so similar between the two centers, it means that it’s less important to focus on manufacturing differences, Sadelain says. More important are the side-effects, seen in all groups of patients who’ve been treated by this method. Twenty-two of the 30 patients experienced cytokine release syndrome, where their immune systems went into overdrive while hunting down the cancer. The cytokine release syndrome creates flu-like symptoms, such as a fever, nausea and muscle pain; 8 patients also experienced breathing difficulties. Those responses can be severe; Whitehead nearly died. The syndrome dies down on its own with time. Figuring out how to manage the response is the next big challenge, Sadelain says. Designer T cells could become an outpatient treatmentUnlike with most cancer therapies, the genetically-modified cells need to be given only once, June says. He hopes to treat patients in less dire straits eventually. For those patients, designer T cells could become an outpatient treatment, since the cytokine release syndrome seems to be related to how many tumors the people being treated have.Today’s trial took into account all patients who were treated. The National Cancer Institute has done work with modified T cells also, using a so-called ""intent-to-treat"" study, a kind of analysis that includes every patient who initially enrolled, even if that patient later drops out of the trial or doesn't take the right dose of drug. The NCI research found that some patients weren’t able to grow full doses of the T cells. Taking into account patients who researchers wanted to treat but couldn’t reach in time or couldn’t grow cells for would probably drop the response rate by about a third, says Crystal Mackall, the chief of pediatric oncology at the National Cancer Institute. The field has undergone a boomThe NCI data, published in the Lancet on Monday, showed that of the 21 patients enrolled, 19 received the prescribed dose; the other two patients had blood cells that didn’t grow to the assigned dose concentration. Unlike in today’s experiment, all surviving patients went on to bone marrow transplant as part of the study design.The most exciting part of the method, which uses what the scientists call chimeric antigen receptor T cells, is that it can be used to target any sugar or protein expressed on the surface of a cancer, June says. His group is looking to begin trials in glioblastoma, pancreatic and ovarian cancer. Sadelain’s group will open studies in breast and lung cancer patients next year. The field has undergone a boom as more researchers and drug companies have become interested.""We're gratified to see industry stepping in.""Besides Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, the University of Pennsylvania and the National Cancer Institute, two other major academic facilities are doing similar work, Baylor College of Medicine and the Seattle Cancer Care Alliance. Meanwhile, Novartis is partnering with the UPenn researchers; Pfizer signed a deal with Cellectis to develop their own technology; GlaxoSmithKline is working with Juno Therapeutics to work on treatments as well; and so too are Celgene and Bluebird Bio, which have rights to the Baylor work. Kite Pharma, another company developing similar technology, had a $128 million IPO in June.""We’re all gratified to see industry stepping in,"" Mackall said. ""Ten years ago, five years ago, if you’d asked me if biotech and big pharma would jump in, I’d say no way. But it’s absolutely happening.""That’s explosive growth since the first case report from June’s lab in 2011, when two of three patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia experienced remission, according to reports in NEJM and Science Translational Medicine. Those patients remain in remission, June says.""We pinch ourselves.""June’s group received a breakthrough therapy designation from the US Food and Drug Administration in July, for treating acute lymphoblastic leukemia in adults and children. The designation, created in 2012, is meant to speed new drugs that treat life-threatening illnesses. The designer T cells were the fifth therapy to receive the designation.""This is unlike almost all cell and gene therapies in that it’s actually ahead of the schedule we set for ourselves when we first started treating patients,"" June said. ""We pinch ourselves because, you know, until recently we didn’t know if we got lucky or if it would last. Our initial patients are still in remission, so we know it’s durable and reproducible. That’s something that makes us excited every day.""",0.6502008887968578,0.3497991112031422,0.8417571774958766,1343,5.3231571109456439,657,6.5433789954337902,1,0,"Science, Report",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Three times the size of today's largest species, these colossal beasts were over 10 feet tall and weighed 240 kg — or 529 lbs. Because of their size, it was hard to tell if they would have moved around like kangaroos do today: by hopping at high speeds and walking on five limbs (arms and tail included) when they slowed down. Now, a study published in PLOS One suggests that these giants may have developed an upright posture — a posture that would have allowed them to put one powerful, gigantic foot in front of the other. In short, they probably didn't hop at all. A rigid back limited their ability to hop In the study, researchers examined the bones of over 45 different species of kangaroos, including bones from the extinct giant kangaroo, Sthenurus stirlingi. This helped them identify some notable differences between current and past species. For instance, the study shows that giant kangaroos had larger knees and hips than the species we see today, as well as stabilized ankle joints. Moreover, they found that the backbone of the giant kangaroo was a lot more rigid than those of other species, a characteristic that indicates that the muscles that flex the spine were probably a lot smaller, proportionally speaking. ""This would limit the ability to hop,"" the researchers write, but would have braced the backbone against the rotational forces generated by putting one foot in front of the other. Because of these differences, the researchers think that as kangaroos became larger, some species started walking on two limbs at slower speeds, instead of bending down to walk on their arms, legs, and tail. And as their backs became more rigid, their tails shortened, because they didn't need them for support, and a long tail would have gotten in the way. Eventually, the largest species stopped hopping altogether. Imagine a 500-lbs kangaroo walking around on two legs What's notable about this finding — besides the visual of a 500-lbs kangaroo walking around on two legs — is that, with the exception of the musky rat-kangaroo, every single species of kangaroo alive today hops. This indicates that hopping is probably an efficient way of getting around, even for larger species. It's also a good explanation for why scientists took so long to suggest that giant kangaroos weren't capable of moving around that way. When researchers look at the bones of extinct specimens, they often use information from living relatives to interpret what they see. Generally, this works pretty well. But every once in a while, you encounter a giant kangaroo. And that kangaroo turns out to be hop-less.",0.38178312673873505,0.618216873261265,0.20672241516272952,448,4.9709821428571432,258,5.6279069767441863,0,0,Science,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

But the satellite record of sea ice only extended as far back as 1979 — at least until recently. As Barents Observer reports, a climate scientist named David Gallaher at the US National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) in Colorado recently managed to painstakingly recover old satellite data from the early 1960s captured by vintage NASA Nimbus satellites. The process was an elaborate one: Gallaher and his colleagues had to sift 25 boxes full of 200-foot-long (60-meter) reels of 35-millimeter film, digitize them using a vintage film reader, and then match them to the location of the satellites in orbit so they could pinpoint the exact location of the photos.  That latter part proved perhaps most challenging, as the record of the orbit was kept in separate infrared imagery, which also had to be processed on its own. In the end, the scientists managed to recover more than 250,000 images, over 90 percent of the data, which they have made public on the website. Already, the data has yielded new insights about the climate, showing larger areas of sea ice in the Arctic on average in the 1960s than we have today, and a huge swing in sea ice in the Antarctic. Aside from yielding new insights about Earth's climate, the new images make for some pretty cool wallpapers, too.

The nurse, 29-year-old Amber Vinson, was among those who provided care to Ebola patient Thomas Duncan at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas. Before flying back to Dallas after a three-day stay in Cleveland, she informed the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that she had a temperature of 99.5 degrees. CDC spokeswoman Barbara Reynolds tells Bloomberg that her temperature was below the agency's threshold for people who have been exposed to Ebola, noting that the mark was lowered in recent weeks from 101.5 degrees to 100.4 degrees. CDC director Thomas Frieden told reporters yesterday that Vinson should not have taken a commercial flight, though he stressed that she would have posed an ""extremely low"" risk to those she traveled with.

In this week's Big Future, Adrianne Jeffries takes a look at the nuts and bolts of a martian settlement, from food shipments to radiation management. There are a lot of problems, but we've got good ideas about how to solve them.   The most encouraging sign is the discovery of water ice on Mars. (There's even some evidence it was once liquid water.) If the colony set up next to a martian glacier, it could potentially convert the ice into drinkable water and breathable air. That would go a long way towards providing for the basic needs of early colonists.   We don't have any idea how to produce food in Martian soil, so even the most ambitious settlements will rely on years of food shipments from Earth. Still, any meaningful colony would have to create a self-sufficient food supply eventually, either through industrial or agricultural breakthroughs. And then there's the radiation...   Background radiation is thousands of times higher on Mars than it is on Earth, so even if we succeed in all the other areas, settlers would still probably face shorter and less healthy lives on Mars. Human beings simply didn't evolve for the Martian environment. But despite the many problems, Mars is still basically as good as it gets. It's close, relatively similar in climate, and there's enough sunlight to run solar power grids. If we can't make it work there, we won't be able to make it work anywhere.

Shocked I tell you, shocked. Meanwhile #clipboarddude #clipboardman thinks he is invisible. Smh. They need to quarantine his ass pronto!!!  Fuck you #clipboardman The vitriol seemed directly linked to the media's take on #ClipboardMan's attire. The Telegraph, for instance, published a video of the event that told viewers that this was both a ""breach of protocol"" and ""an embarrassment for the [US] government.""     Credit: Telegraph But here's the thing: although #ClipboardMan could be wearing more protection — gloves and a face mask wouldn't hurt — he doesn't look like he's touching Vinson. He doesn't look like he's touching the people wearing protection either. So if what we see in the video is all that happened, #ClipboardMan's risk of getting infected doesn't appear to be very high. After all, Ebola isn't airborne. It can only be transmitted by coming into contact with the bodily fluids of someone who's showing symptoms. Vinson, of course, has been showing symptoms for a few days now, but if she isn't projectile vomiting, and #ClipboardMan isn't going out of his way to touch things she has also touched, this probably isn't a big deal. He isn't touching Vinson or the people wearing protective gear Still, this form of reasoning doesn't explain why he wasn't wearing a suit in the first place. Fortunately, ABC News took the time to dig up some information. As it turns out, biohazard suits aren't just hard to remove, they're also hard to see through. #ClipboardMan is the medical protocol supervisor charged with making sure that the people wearing protective gear don't accidentally trip over something, or touch a surface they shouldn't. ""Our medical professionals in the biohazard suits have limited vision and mobility and it is the protocol supervisor's job to watch each person carefully and give them verbal directions to insure no close contact protocols are violated,"" a spokesperson from Phoenix Air, the airline used to transport Vinson to Atlanta, told ABC News. ""it is the protocol supervisor's job to watch each person carefully."" This is a perfectly reasonable explanation for #ClipboardMan's lack of protective gear. He was making sure everyone else was being careful. Yet multiple news outlets rushed to point out his clipboard without supplying readers with an explanation. Ebola is a scary, gruesome disease, so it's only natural that some people are concerned, especially given past ""breaches in protocol"" in Dallas. But that's why we need reporters to help people make sense of it all (Fox News' Shepard Smith is a great example). They have a responsibility to stop unnecessary panic — to explain why Ebola isn't easy to catch in the US — instead of causing further alarm with unfinished stories and inaccurate statements.",0.180894790242108,0.819105209757892,0.6667311258171694,588,5.2193877551020407,347,6.2680115273775217,0,2,,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The US will not fund any new research and is encouraging those with existing research to pause their experiments. There were apparently biosafety ""incidents"" at federally-funded research centers. As a result, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, along with the Department of Health and Human Services, is launching ""a deliberative process"" to assess risks associated with this type of research. In August, a CDC researcher contaminated samples while rushing to a meeting. And in June, the CDC left anthrax samples unlocked and used expired disinfectant on them.  It's not clear from the White House statement if these were the  incidents being referred to. A call to Becky Fried, a spokeswoman for  the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy wasn't  immediately returned.

Right now, these types of studies are ongoing in influenza, Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome, and sudden acute respiratory syndrome. The White House is particularly concerned with research expected to create versions of those pathogens that increase airborne transmission. The risk that viruses and bacteria will become stronger or easier to transmit exists in nature. Scientists do gain of function studies in order to evaluate the risks and figure out how to fight future mutations. ""NIH  has funded such studies because they help define  the fundamental nature of  human-pathogen interactions, enable the  assessment of the pandemic potential of  emerging infectious agents, and  inform public health and preparedness  efforts,"" the National Institutes of Health director Francis Collins said in a statement.  ""These studies,  however, also entail biosafety and biosecurity  risks, which need to be  understood better."" This isn't the first time gain-of-function research has been halted. In January 2012, international researchers issued a moratorium on testing H5N1, the bird flu virus, and didn't resume testing until 2013. This isn't the first time gain of function studies have been haltedThe National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity will meet on October 22 to debate the issues and begin making recommendations. The NSABB is the official Federal adviser for oversight on these areas of research. In addition, the National Research Council will be asked to create a scientific symposium to debate the benefits and risks, as well as a second one, later, to discuss NSABB's draft recommendations. The final recommendations from the NSABB ""will inform the development and adoption of a new U.S.  Government policy regarding gain-of-function research,"" according to the White House statement.

When turned on, the switch activates a copper grid that blocks all wireless signals, acting as a Faraday cage for each room.

Well, where to start. Microsoft's now-defunct digital assistant has long been a byword for disastrous software design, but it seems there are still new lessons to be learned from the anthropomorphic paperclip's demise. One problem identified in the recent documentary Code: Debugging the Gender Gap and reported by The Atlantic, is that Clippy was the product of an unthinkingly male environment. Roz Ho, a former Microsoft executive who was at the company during Clippy's conception, said that early focus group feedback from female users on Clippy and other Office assistants was ""kind of negative."" In the documentary Ho says: According to The Atlantic, Ho goes on to note that in the end, Clippy's creators just ignored this feedback because it didn't fit with what they were expecting to hear. Today's sexualized female assistants show we've not learned much Although Clippy's implied sexuality was only a small part of what went wrong with the software, it's interesting to consider how little we've apparently learned from episodes like this. The latest crop of digital assistants like Apple's Siri and Microsoft's Cortana may not be leering and male, but they've certainly got their own gender issues. While Clippy's personality was interfering and patronizing, Siri and Cortana are subservient to the point of creepiness, leading to accusations of latent sexism. Critics point out that these computer programs are marketed as real people, as real women, and they just happen to be unquestioning and compliant — implicitly confirming society's expectation of women. As Jezebel's Isha Aran pointed out in 2013, the tech world has long cultivated ""an inextricable link between feminine sexuality and technology"" which is ""indicative of some intense and harmful objectification of women."" Aran points to sexist ads from the 60s as evidence, but it seems that not much has changed for the smartphone generation. A Microsoft ad from earlier this year compares both Cortana and Siri to girlfriends that users can choose between.

That has been a major concern for tech investors and entrepreneurs ever since the FCC lost its court battle with Verizon back in January. Today a group of leading venture capitalists published an open letter to the FCC calling on them to prevent what they say would be the end of net neutrality and a crippling blow to young startups. ""The internet will no longer be a level playing field."" ""If established companies are able to pay for better access speeds or lower latency, the internet will no longer be a level playing field,"" they write. ""Startups with applications that are advantaged by speed (such as games, video, or payment systems) will be unlikely to overcome that deficit no matter how innovative their service."" The group includes investors from around the country, including Union Square Ventures, Andreessen Horowitz, First Round Capital, and many more. Collectively they have funded companies like Twitter, Facebook, Foursquare, Tumblr, and others. You can read their full letter here. They join a group of the world's biggest tech companies who filed a protest with the FCC yesterday. So far these ""fast lanes"" are just hypothetical. A good example of a young startup that could suffer from paid fast lanes is Twitch, which sits at the intersection of video and gaming. During its peak hours, Twitch already sends more traffic than giants like Facebook or Amazon. But of course it doesn't yet have anywhere near their revenues. If it had to pay for a ""fast lane"" to ensure its data got to customers, its business could be crippled. So far these ""fast lanes"" are just hypothetical. Many companies, like Netflix, Google, and Microsoft, already pay for special interconnection to ISPs. But this is a separate issue than the FCC's ruling on whether companies like Verizon and Comcast can charge to privilege some data in the so-called ""last mile"" between their networks and consumers' homes. The FCC has promised that all those deals will be regulated to ensure they are ""commercially reasonable,"" a vague term that has net neutrality advocates very worried.

Epic Games has just announced that the next Unreal Tournament will be completely free, and developed entirely in the open. Starting today, anyone can contribute. While the project will be led by senior Epic Games programmers, the game will be effectively developed by you. """"From the very first line of code, the very first art created and design decision made, development will happen in the open, as a collaboration between Epic, UT fans and UE4 developers,"" writes longtime Unreal Tournament programmer Steve Polge, in a blog post discussing the plan. All the code and all the content will be freely accessible in a Github respository, which should be live soon. The company is also detailing the project on Twitch, and intends to issue regular video updates there. ""This is real development from scratch."" What's the catch? According to Polge, you shouldn't expect to play the game anytime soon. ""This is real development from scratch."" The company also plans to pay for the game, eventually, with an online marketplace for user-generated mods and content. Epic will take a share of the revenue from those, much like how Valve makes its money from Team Fortress 2 and DOTA 2. The company also sees other advantages to crowdsourcing, though: ""All those ideas we'd never be able to push or iterate on, we now have this huge group of people who are able to do that. You can't buy that,"" says Epic Games veteran Joe Wilcox. What will the game actually be like? That's up to you: ""From the very first line of code, the very first art created and design decision made, development will happen in the open, as a collaboration between Epic, UT fans and UE4 developers,"" writes Polge. All we know for sure is that it will be ""true to its roots"" as a competitive first-person shooting title, and target Windows, Mac, and Linux. ""a collaboration between Epic, UT fans and UE4 developers"" The decision to make Unreal Tournament completely free and completely open may dovetail nicely with another recent Epic Games move: the company drastically reduced the price of building games with Unreal Engine 4 to $19 a month, plus five percent of a game developer's gross revenue. Though Unreal Tournament fans will be able to share ideas for the new game on the company's forums, you'll need to be a UE4 developer to fully contribute.

The company announced the news yesterday, but Vyrros left Apple several months ago, sources tell The Verge, where he was also responsible for Apple's push notification services, iTunes Genius, Game Center, and Back To My Mac. Prior to Apple, Vyrros held leadership roles at Yahoo and Xerox PARC, and was a developer at Steve Jobs' NeXT computer company. Not much has been written on Vyrros, who has remained mostly under the radar during his time at Apple, but his contributions were immeasurable, sources say. Vyrros becomes CTO at Layer, a startup we profiled back in December that hopes to let any developer add chat features to their app with only ten lines of code. Layer also provides push notification services, cloud sync, offline storage, and most other services a message app would need. These kinds of services could take several months to build from scratch. Layer hopes to offer up these services for a small fee.  ""Layer offers something beyond all that. Because we're not just focusing on a single application."" Vyrros is only the latest of several tech all stars to join Layer. Jeremie Miller, the man credited with creating the XMPP (Jabber) chat language joined the company last fall, as did George Patterson, former director of operations at OpenDNS — a global infrastructure that handles 50 billion queries per day. Layer was also co-founded by Ron Palmeri, one of the guys behind Grand Central, which was acquired by Google and became Google Voice. Few people have as much experience scaling infrastructures as the people Layer has collected. Vyrros, for one, saw iMessage grow from nothing to handling billions of messages per day. ""Building that crap is hard. If you want security, scalability, low latency, bandwidth and power efficiency (and you do), it becomes brutally difficult. But also interesting and challenging and pretty darn fun. This is where Layer comes in,"" Vyrros wrote in a blog post yesterday. ""Layer offers something beyond all that. Because we're not just focusing on a single application. We're laying out a whole dang platform, something that can grow a multitude of novel apps."" Layer hasn't yet launched to the public, but has amassed a wait list developers hoping to add messaging features to their app. Correction: An earlier version of this article credited Andrew Vyrros as the ""inventor"" of iMessage.

But the original Financial Times report in early May that broke the news Apple was planning to buy Beats Electronics — giving it a billion-dollar electronics brand and a functional Spotify competitor — was soon followed by weeks of an impending deal, even some rumors buoyed by Dr. Dre himself. Now Apple has officially confirmed its purchase of Beats for $3 billion, its biggest acquisition to date. So, what exactly is it buying? In the short term, Apple acquires a fast-growing brand whose ability to sell electronics at a high premium is rivaled only by Apple itself. Beats, a six-year-old company whose founders include Dr. Dre and record executive Jimmy Iovine, is reportedly profitable on revenues that were said to exceed $1 billion last year. Beats entered the market in 2008 with $350 headphones, and five years later commanded 59 percent of the market for headphones that cost more than $99, according to NPD Group. Its revenues quintupled between 2010 and 2012, according to The Wall Street Journal. A design that replaced white earbuds as a status symbol Along the way, Beats came to colonize the Apple Store, where its products dominate the headphone table. Though critics generally panned their ham-fisted sound reproduction, the company’s bold designs and the endorsement of Dr. Dre helped transform premium audio from a geeky obsession of audiophiles to an affordable luxury craved by the masses. The company also showed a genius for marketing — when Iovine served as a judge on American Idol from 2011 to 2013, a product-placement deal put Beats headphones on display in front of millions every week. Over time, the company’s lowercase ""b"" logo replaced Apple’s iconic white earbuds as a status symbol for music lovers. Acquiring Beats lets Apple begin selling a range of high-end accessories to its own best-selling devices, earning profit margins that can exceed its own. (A $200 pair of Beats Headphones is said to cost the manufacturer as little as $14.) It gives Apple control over a powerful new music brand that has proven especially popular with younger people. And if the Beats brand survives, there would seemingly be a huge opportunity for Apple to grow it globally.  And in the longer term, the Beats acquisition could give Apple a music service to rival Spotify. Apple is still the dominant seller of digital music, but the 99-cent downloads that it pioneered are declining as more people turn to streaming services like Pandora and Spotify. Sales of individual songs have declined 12 percent in the past year, according to Nielsen SoundScan. Steve Jobs famously hated the subscription model of online music, but the growth of such services indicates an appetite that Apple may no longer have been able to ignore. ReCode reports that revenues from iTunes Match (a cloud music locker) and iTunes Radio (a Pandora clone) have disappointed the music industry. Meanwhile Beats Music, which launched its all-access music service in January, is said to have acquired fewer than 200,000 followers despite a massive marketing campaign and a number of friendly deals with cellular carriers. Spotify is expanding aggressively While Apple has dithered with music services, Spotify has expanded aggressively around the world. The Swedish company, which has raised more than $500 million, expanded from 17 to 32 markets last year. It remains unprofitable, and its long-term prospects remain unclear. But its notion of on-demand access to music for a low monthly fee has already converted tens of millions of paying subscribers. Apple may be looking for a fast way to offer its customers a similar service — and with more than 800 million credit cards already on file, it could rapidly eclipse all competitors.    More worrisome, from Apple’s perspective, may be that it could give music fans one less reason to buy an iPhone, iPad, or iPod Touch. Apple was the first company to make it easy to synchronize music to a mobile device, with iTunes as the linchpin connecting everything. A Spotify account, on the other hand, can bring your music from iOS to Android to Windows Phone. Given the essential role music played in bringing Apple back from the brink of death, it’s only natural that the company would want to keep pace with the changing ways we listen to it. Notably, the company has reportedly been exploring iTunes for Android.  None of which is to say that acquiring Beats is conventional for Apple. For starters, it’s expensive: the company’s largest acquisition to date, NeXT, was for $400 million in 1996 and gave Apple the core of an operating system it still uses today. (It also returned to Apple Steve Jobs himself, who had founded NeXT after departing Apple in the 1980s.) The Beats acquisition would put Apple in the unusual position of managing a consumer brand not its own — and raising difficult questions about whether to keep the existing music service and, if so, on which platforms. How Beats will — or will not — integrate into Apple will be one of the most closely watched aspects of the merger agreement. As with any acquisition, it will be months before we can begin to assess whether Apple is getting its $3 billion’s worth. But if music technology in the 2000s was all about the iPod plus iTunes, in this decade that equation is shifting rapidly toward Spotify and Beats. Premium music technology that operates independently of platform, marketed with flair to a younger generation. In time, Apple may have been able to build that technology itself. But it may be less risky simply to buy it. Editor's note: this post was updated after publication to reflect confirmation of Apple's purchase of Beats.

It's the first of what Lyft hopes will be a fleet of vehicles people will pay more to ride than the smaller, less luxurious Toyota Priuses and Corollas that make up the bulk of the cars in its network. Short of the word ""Explorer"" emblazoned in chrome in the back and on the side mirrors, the outside's been stripped of nearly all its branding. The typical blue Ford oval in the back has been hidden, and in the front is a jet black grill with a diminutive, off-center silver mustache - a classy reimagining of Lyft's signature pink, furry logo. Not aimed at bargain passengers This is Lyft Plus, and it will soon be an option in San Francisco at twice the price of what Lyft currently charges for set-price hauls. Similar to Uber's black SUVs, it's aimed less at the people who would normally shell out for a taxi, and more for those who are having a night out (on a date or in a group), or just don't mind spending more for luxury. If Lyft's pilot of Plus is successful, it could roll out to additional cities. What you get for the extra rate is a white Ford Explorer that fits six people. It's also been gussied up with diamond-stitched leather seats, dark gray suede across the ceiling, silver and black rims, and music from Spotify's premium service. There are other little touches too, like chocolates, bottled water, and a universal phone charger that pokes out of the center armrest.  The new service was developed primarily because Lyft is growing like crazy, both in staff size and customer base. So far it's in 60 markets, and has tallied up ""millions"" of rides shared. The company's new office in the Mission District of San Francisco, where the car in front of me is parked, opened just two weeks ago, and already there's talk of moving somewhere bigger within a year. Paying for all that is more than $330 million in funding, with $250 million of that coming as part of a Series D round last month. The company's said it plans to use the funds to expand its operations to new cities, and with good reason: as the number of people who want to use the service has grown, so are the riders who want to travel in groups. The requirement to be a driver has always been that you could fit four passengers, but as Lyft's gotten more popular, the company realized it was giving up business to competitors. ""We saw huge holes."" ""We saw huge holes with people who wanted to take a whole group, or to go to the airport with luggage, or move something,"" Lyft's Ethan Eyler explains to me while we both sit in the back seat of the Plus vehicle. ""All these seats fold down,"" he adds, noting you could even do a move using one of these if you wanted to. Eyler was the one who created the mustache for cars (also known as a ""carstache""), the pink version of which immediately became Lyft's brand and persona. Part of his job as the company's in-house ""inventor"" was to figure out what would go into making the higher-end rides jibe with the company's scrappy persona. He's the one sourcing the chocolate bars, and who worked with California car shop West Coast Customs to select the vehicles and trim they'd end up using, though he says the actual interior design and matte white paintjob were outside ideas.  The cars are destined to be purchased by Lyft drivers, the company says. It's purchasing the vehicles and having them outfitted, but then drivers have the opportunity to buy them and drive in them. The first crop of drivers given the chance to buy into that are some of the oldest and most active, Lyft says; how much they'll pay for that privilege, the company won't say. Drivers are basically investing in Lyft In return for their service, Lyft Plus drivers have the chance to make more than they would as a typical Lyft driver who charges by distance (some also drive for a donation depending on what city the service is in). For Lyft Plus, that works out to 50 cents per minute and $3 per mile, with a $5 pickup fee and $10 minimum per ride ride. Even with those rates, Lyft says Lyft Plus will cost 20 percent less than Uber's black car service, and 40 percent less than its SUV offering. It also doesn't plan to adjust those prices based on supply and demand like its ""Prime Time"" mode, or what Uber does with its surge pricing, at least not until there are more of these new cars on the road. All these differences could help set Lyft Plus apart in an industry that's quickly becoming crowded with both entry-level and luxury options. Where Lyft found a way to shake up the established world of taxis and private car companies with something that could cost less and give normal drivers a way to make money, it now hopes to do the same for those with cash to burn. Even so, Eyler hopes Plus will still feel like a casual and communal experience. ""So much of it is about socializing, and about who you're riding along with too,"" he says. ""We still have the ‘stache magic.""",0.5135589662578707,0.4864410337421293,0.8684498519489803,929,4.4725511302475782,478,5.5627615062761508,0,0,"Business, Tech",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

To meet the Pentagon's demands, the Air Force has begun pulling drone operators from its schools, which has in turn left its training squadrons understaffed. Overworked crew members have had to miss training that would help advance their careers, spurring many operators to leave the Air Force altogether.

The Washington Post reports that Wheeler is planning to internally distribute an updated version of the Open Internet rules he's been working on for almost a year, with the goal of getting them passed in a February 26th meeting; an FCC spokesperson confirmed to The Verge that Wheeler would indeed circulate an order next month. There's no clue as to what these rules might entail, but the Post paraphrases analysts and officials close to the FCC, saying that Wheeler is planning ""far more aggressive regulation"" than he originally proposed. Wheeler may plan on ""far more aggressive regulation"" than originally proposed The proposal would replace the Open Internet Order that was struck down in court at the beginning of last year, creating rules to prevent internet service providers from unfairly blocking or discriminating against content. After introducing a tentative proposal in the spring of 2014, Wheeler initially hoped to have new rules in place by the end of 2014. But both critics and supporters of net neutrality were wary of his plan; the former worried that any regulation could stifle internet innovation, and the latter believed that his proposal might not stand up to another lawsuit, or that it would leave loopholes that would let ISPs charge more for preferential service. At the end of the year, President Barack Obama came out in favor of a potentially stricter solution: reclassifying broadband as a Title II service like telephone networks. It's a solution internet companies like Netflix have lauded, but cable providers have opposed. This reportedly conflicted with Wheeler's proposed plan, but the chairman has remained equivocal on the issue — though we'll expect to see more specifics soon. Either way, the vote will likely be split down party lines: Wheeler, along with liberal commissioners Jessica Rosenworcel and Mignon Clyburn, voted for new Open Internet rules, while conservatives Ajit Pai and Michael O'Rielly have vocally opposed them.

Of course, it's been adjusted to work better on a laptop screen, and there's been a big focus on speed and getting you through the interface quickly.

You can also hover over elements of the new interface to pull up more information rather than clicking through to a new screen.

When it was released in the summer of 2005, it wasn’t the only superhero movie on the block, but it was by far the best, and the impact it had continues to reverberate to this very day. We wouldn’t have Christian Bale's Batman voice without it, for one — nor would we have its even more beloved 2008 sequel The Dark Knight. Most importantly, Batman Begins made dark reboots a thing, a successful template that studios would bank on for years to come. And that’s why I’m calling it out. Batman Begins was the beginning of a rut that Hollywood still hasn’t managed to get out of.  Now, I can tell you’re upset, so let me back up and say that it’s still a great movie. Where other superhero flicks of the time leaned on their effects budgets often to their detriment, director Christopher Nolan gave Begins a grounded, neo-noir feel that helped distract from how inherently silly it is for a billionaire to dress up like a bat and spend his nights beating up mob thugs. As grimy as his take on Gotham City was, Wally Pfister made everything look gorgeous. And the cast? It might not have been Katie Holmes’ most memorable turn, but the film had the likes of Michael Caine and Gary Oldman classing up the joint even further, and Christian Bale quickly made himself a contender for ""Best Batman,"" right up there with Michael Keaton and Kevin Conroy. Batman Begins isn't the Godfather of 21st Century Superhero Movies But Batman Begins is not the Godfather of 21st Century Superhero Movies, as some more hardcore fans might have you believe. Yes, it managed to till the scorched earth of the Batman brand after Joel Schumacher’s Batman & Robin crashed and burned so spectacularly. But by 2005, Hollywood had already been trying (and often, succeeding) to make ""good"" superhero movies for a while. The X-Men (2000) and Spider-Man (2002) movies saw great mainstream commercial and critical success, and are both considered classics. And don’t forget that there were five other comic book movies in 2005 right alongside it (Fantastic Four, Elektra, V for Vendetta, Sin City, and Constantine). That something like Begins would come along seems almost inevitable. No, the most important thing about the movie is its being a standard bearer for contemporary gritty realism. Granted, Nolan didn’t have to do much heavy lifting to make that work given Batman’s already noirish themes. But its success taught Hollywood that digging up old stories and repainting them with a darker palette could make a whole generation of moviegoers fill theater seats. We’re living in the age of the reboot, and ""dark"" is an easy shorthand to follow if studios won’t spring for originality. If not for Nolan’s Batman, we wouldn’t have The Amazing Spider-Man, which retold Peter Parker’s origin story with a few bleak twists. We wouldn’t have Man of Steel, which gave us a dour look at Superman’s first fight to save the world. We wouldn’t have Rise of the Planet of the Apes, RoboCop, or even Godzilla, all grimmer takes on storied properties. Some of those films turned out quite well, but the formula has long since turned stale. It’s a meme. (Naturally, the internet runs wild with the concept.) In 2015, we’re conditioned to expect that each of our beloved cultural touchstones will eventually get its own grimdark retelling. But there’s something inherently lazy about essentially remixing The Wrath of Khan for a post-9/11 age in Star Trek Into Darkness or turning Dracula into history’s first anti-hero in Dracula Untold. We're now drowning in a deluge of franchise reboots Batman Begins helped put us on the path to where we are are now — drowning in a deluge of franchise reboots — but, considering Disney is now redoing everything it’s ever done, the film isn’t solely to blame. And not everyone is going grim. But I groan every time I learn about some gritty rehash about to hit theaters. Again, it’s a great movie, and we’re better off having made the leap away from Joel Schumacher’s take on the Dark Knight. But I wish the movies I love today were a bit brighter and told stories I haven’t heard before.",0.642455596119998,0.35754440388000197,0.15757091293524575,721,4.8807212205270458,429,5.7156177156177153,0,0,"Culture, Entertainment, Does it hold up?, Film",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

It adroitly stayed away from less popular topics like Xbox apps and the Kinect (which was totally absent) and included crowd-pleasing announcements like the option to play Xbox 360 games on the Xbox One. It's nearing the release of its flagship exclusive Halo 5: Guardians, which is coming out later this year. And the rest of its slate, including Rise of the Tomb Raider and a new Gears of War, doesn't look half bad either. In theory, Microsoft is competing with Sony here, but its keynote seemed like a much more direct response to PC gaming: it introduced a more customizable controller and an early access program for Xbox One games. And the rest of the week is going to be big for augmented and virtual reality: one of the coolest parts of the show was a HoloLens version of Minecraft, which we'll be learning more about next month.     Microsoft was dismissive of backwards compatibility when the Xbox One was in development. Now that the console has been out for a year and a half, though, the company is walking that back. Around the end of the year, Microsoft will make its first batch of around 100 last-generation Xbox titles playable on the console, with a promise that players won't have to pay for titles they already own. The ""Elite"" wireless controller is a more customizable version of the standard Xbox gamepad, with features like controls that can be re-mapped and a directional pad that can be swapped out. It works on Windows 10 as well as the Xbox, making it a bit of a competitor to the computer-friendly and similarly remappable Steam Controller. Halo 5: Guardians appeared at last year's E3 as well, but we've now gotten a much better look at the game's cooperative combat and its over-the-top cinematic graphics. Among other things, there's a new multiplayer mode called ""Warzone,"" and the multiplayer maps in general are supposed to be several times larger than in past games. Halo 5 is coming out in October, giving the Xbox One a much-needed exclusive blockbuster. We generally know very little about the post-apocalyptic ReCore, but our own Jake Kastrenakes describes it as a mashup of Star Wars and Wall-E. It's an Xbox One exclusive developed by Keiji Inafune, who helped create Mega Man, and the makers of Metroid Prime. And it's going to be out in the spring of 2016.   Granted, the Forza series generally banks on looking gorgeous — if you don't have any guns in your game, you've got to have something to make up for it, and it might as well be dynamic weather. But the early Forza Motorsport 6 footage from E3 gives us a hint at what's to come. The game itself will be out on September 15th. Microsoft is announcing something that looks a lot like Steam's Early Access program, which has helped boost cult games like DayZ. As of today, Game Preview will let Xbox One owners buy and play unfinished versions of games, effectively acting as beta testers in exchange for getting to play it sooner. The program is starting with The Long Dark and Elite: Dangerous, but if this follows the trajectory of PC early access games, it could take off quickly. Rare is the studio behind beloved titles like Perfect Dark and Conker's Bad Fur Day, and the Rare Replay collection is exactly what it sounds like: a whole lot of Rare games (30 of them, actually) bundled and sold for $30 this August. Sadly but predictably, it looks like the especially beloved games Goldeneye and Donkey Kong Country won't be included — licensing issues with Nintendo have tied them up a little too firmly.     One of the original demos for Microsoft's HoloLens augmented reality headset was something very much like Minecraft, but now it's official. You can create a pixelated world on your coffee table, using HoloLens' voice and gesture commands to build it. These controls still aren't very sophisticated, though, so a standard controller is probably still more comfortable We'll learn more about AR Minecraft this summer. Besides Halo, one of Microsoft's more high-profile exclusives is Rise of the Tomb Raider. The game, which was announced in 2014, will launch first on the Xbox platform (both One and 360) before making its way to PlayStation. Microsoft showed off its prize at today's event, giving us a glimpse of some wintery exploration. Gears of War, the series Microsoft acquired from Epic Games last year, is getting its first non-Epic installment. It's called Gears 4, and while we saw some footage at E3, all we really know is that it's slated for the holiday season of 2016. As it did with the Halo series, Microsoft is also remastering Gears of War, with an ""ultimate"" edition available in beta today.

But VSCO has long had greater ambitions for the app than just editing images. The Grid and Journal features offer ways for photographers to share their images with other VSCO users, either one at a time or through a collected narrative. Today, the company is adding the ability to curate images taken by others to your own VSCO account. The new Collections feature, which is available on both the iOS and Android versions of VSCO Cam today, lets users re-share images published by others that are visible through in the Grid, through search, or through their own feed. Sharing an image is a two-step process: you double tap something you like to save it to your library, and then you have to go back into your library of images to re-share it out to the world. VSCO co-founder and CEO Joel Flory says this added friction when sharing images was intentional in order to make sharing more deliberate. ""It's a very intentional publishing aspect,"" he notes. Images shared to a collection preserve attribution to the original photographer and link back to their accounts, further differentiating the feature from other platforms that are known for curation. At launch, VSCO Cam Collections only support still images, though the company will likely expand it in the future to include other forms of media that are shared through the platform. Users are also only allowed one Collection on their account, so it's not yet possible to create different ones for different themes.   Collection mimics the internal tools VSCO has been using to share and highlight images on the platform Flory says that the new feature mimics the tools that the VSCO team has been using to highlight users and content internally, and it is the first time that the company is giving its tens of millions of users access to these same tools. Until now, the VSCO platform has been focused on original content, but Flory believes that curation plays a part in the creative process and the Collections feature was built to address that. Though Collections adds even more sharing capabilities to the VSCO platform, it still has a different take and feel than other image sharing platforms, such as Instagram or Tumblr. Statistics like number of shares are only visible to the original image owner, and are not publicly displayed in other Collections. Users also cannot like or comment on images shared to a Collection. Flory says the goal of Collections is not to drive user numbers, but to ""encourage the consumption of more quality content."" Flory also says that Collections and curation are the first of many things the company will ""continue to innovate on,"" and it plans to improve upon and open up the curation process even further in the future. For now, it's both a useful bookmarking tool and sharing system, and it will be interesting to see if it takes off with VSCO's many devoted users.",0.8829525510193423,0.11704744898065766,0.8306964846612512,519,4.8208092485549132,262,5.8053435114503813,0,2,"Apps, Photography, Tech",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

In a live keynote today, the companies announced 3D Xpoint, a new category of non-volatile memory that claims to be 1,000 times faster than the NAND architecture underlying most flash memory cards and solid state drives. The new architecture does without transistors entirely, relying on a bulk material property change to switch bits from a low-resistance to a high-resistance state. From there, memory cells are layered in an intricate three-dimensional checkerboard pattern that Intel researchers say is 10 times denser than conventional memory. ""For decades, the industry has searched for ways to reduce the lag time between the processor and data to allow much faster analysis,"" said Intel VP Rob Crooke in a statement. ""This new class of non-volatile memory achieves this goal and brings game-changing performance to memory and storage solutions."" The limitations of the new memory class are still unclear, but its earliest applications are likely to be in real-time data analysis, where fast access to large datasets is at a premium. Intel singled out fraud detection and disease tracking as likely early applications, but said the chip could also be used to power more immersive gaming experiences if brought to the PC.

It was a giant bet on touch-based computing, but it made using a PC with a keyboard and mouse awkward, frustrating, and outright confusing. In our original review, I wrote that there was a “risk of alienating users and creating another Vista-like perception catastrophe” due to the sweeping changes.  That’s exactly what happened: developers didn’t flock toward Windows 8, and regular users did their very best to avoid it. While the tablet interface was a great experience, the rest annoyed everybody who just wanted a laptop that worked the way they were used to. Microsoft is trying to fix all that with Windows 10.  Windows has a cycle. Windows XP saved us from Windows ME, Windows 7 saved us from the Windows Vista mess, now Windows 10 is here to save save us from Windows 8. It’s nice to be on the good part of the cycle.  If you’re upgrading to Windows 10 on a desktop or laptop PC, then prepare to be delightfully surprised: the Start menu you know and love is back. It feels slightly odd to celebrate its return, as it should never have gone away. It’s probably the biggest change, aside from the dark theme, that you’ll notice after Windows 8. But Microsoft hasn’t simply just reinstated the old version from Windows 7. Instead, it’s completely redesigned it in a way that combines the best aspects of the last two versions of Windows. Instead of booting you a completely different screen, the Start menu lives in the lower-lefthand corner — just like it did in Windows 7. Microsoft is keeping the Live Tiles it introduced in Windows 8, but it’s put them inside the Start menu. That means that they  won’t take up your entire monitor anymore (unless you really want them to). You can pin both modern and traditional apps to the Start menu, and there’s easy access to settings, shutdown or restart, and a list of most-used apps complete with handy jump lists for apps like Word that handle files. This mix of features feels like the best approach for bringing the Start menu back, and you can resize it freely to customize it further. It seems like every version of Windows brings a different theme, and Windows 10 is no different. It’s more restrained than Windows 8 or Vista were — but not as boring as Windows 7. A black theme sets the stage for Windows 10, but if you’re not a fan of the darkness, then there are options to pick an accent color that can be shown on the Start menu, task bar, and the new Action Center. Across all three, you’ll notice subtle transparency effects have returned to Windows 10 from their roots in Windows Vista and Windows 7. Microsoft hasn’t added any transparency to built-in apps like File Explorer, so the effect isn’t overplayed or irritating. It feels utilitarian, but in a modern way. Navigating around Windows 10 is also greatly improved. The annoying hot corners in Windows 8 that made you pull your hair out just trying to access settings or even the Start screen have been removed — thank god. A new Action Center works as a notification center to collect alerts from apps and provide quick access to settings. Microsoft has focused a lot on multitasking with Windows 10. The Snap feature has seen the biggest improvements here. You can drag any window to a screen edge to snap it to half of your screen, and then the OS helpfully displays all of your other windows in an array for the other half. If you use a touchscreen, you can swipe from the left to bring up a list of all open apps and snap two of them alongside each other. Alongside the snapping improvements is a new feature called Task View, which is a lot like Mission Control on the Mac. It displays all your open windows on a single screen so you can find what you’re looking for quickly. Microsoft has added a dedicated button to the task bar to try and get Windows 10 users to activate Task View and start using it. Microsoft claims the vast majority of its users have never used Alt+Tab to switch apps (one of those ""weird but true"" things about computers), so the idea is to help those users get better at multitasking. That little button is also the gateway to a great new feature: virtual desktops. Yes, Microsoft has finally added this to Windows after years of having to use third-party alternatives. It’s a true power user option, allowing you to create separate virtual desktops with different apps. I consider myself a Windows power user, but I only find myself using virtual desktops on my laptop rather than my desktop PC. There’s no quick way to switch between virtual desktops using a trackpad or mouse, but Windows key + Ctrl + left / right is a handy shortcut. I find the quickest way to access Task View (and virtual desktops) is simply by swiping up with three fingers on a trackpad. Microsoft has also built a virtual assistant like Siri right into Windows 10. It’s called Cortana, and  it’s designed to look and feel like an extension of the Start menu, and just like the Windows Phone equivalent, you can also use your voice to search. There’s also an option to enable a ""hey Cortana"" feature that lets you simply holler questions at your laptop. It’s useful for simple things like the weather, but I found myself mostly using it to demonstrate Cortana to friends and family. Cortana’s visual interface is a lot more useful. It’s an overview of your day mixed with the weather, news, local restaurants, and other interests you’ve selected. I tap on Cortana’s icon in the task bar occasionally to see this overview, and all the data is displayed in sections that resemble Google’s Now cards. Cortana keeps everything it knows about you in a virtual notebook, which you can edit to trim out information you don’t want it to remember. It’s also cloud powered, meaning you can download Cortana for Android (or iOS in the future) and get the same features there, all synced up with your laptop. So if you ask Cortana to remind you to buy some milk from a local grocery store, that reminder will sync to your phone and activate as soon as you’re near the grocery store. That’s a particularly useful and powerful feature of Cortana, and it’s one I find myself using regularly. Cortana also handles local search, and it’s excellent. Hitting the ""My Stuff"" button within a Cortana search will search for files that are local to the machine and any data stored on OneDrive. Having a single interface for virtual assistant searches, web searches, and traditional computer searches is a super convenient and powerful thing, and Microsoft has done a really great job of integrating it here. It might be my favorite thing about Windows 10. Windows 10 also includes a new browser, called Edge. It may be new, but it sadly sticks to the past in a number of ways. Edge’s task bar icon is barely different from that of Internet Explorer, in an effort to keep it familiar to the millions of diverse Windows users. It’s simplified, clean, and performs well in most cases — but it’s lacking features you might expect of a modern browser. Snapping tabs into new windows is messy and clunky, and downloads start automatically with no choice of where they’re being stored. This is basic stuff, and it’s surprising it’s missing. Microsoft really started from scratch with Edge, and it shows. With most browsers, the one key thing I care about is performance, and Edge mostly delivers. Rendering most popular websites is smooth, and load times are usually good. It still feels like there’s some work to be done on occasions, and I’ve run into situations where pages just don’t render well at all or sites ask me to use Internet Explorer. Yes, Internet Explorer still exists in Windows 10, and you can access it through an ""Open with Internet Explorer"" option in Edge. Edge does have some neat new features.  You can draw all over webpages and send a copy to friends. It’s useful if you want to quickly share a screenshot of a site with some annotations, but it’s something I haven’t found myself using regularly (it’s better if you use it with a pen-enabled device like the Surface). It’s cool for the first few times, and then you quickly forget it exists. One addition I did find very useful is Cortana. The digital assistant is integrated into Microsoft Edge, and it shows up in clever little ways. If you search for something in the address bar like ""weather,"" then it will immediately surface the weather nearby. The instances in which it's really useful are when it gives me the information I need without having to load a full search page. If I search for ""how tall is Tom Cruise"" then it immediately returns the result before I’ve even had the chance to hit Enter. Microsoft Edge still feels like a work in progress, much like Windows 10 itself. Changing the default search experience is stressful, with a requirement to visit Google itself and then access a feature buried so deep in the settings menus that it feels like Microsoft really doesn’t want you moving away from Bing. Equally, if I want Google Chrome as my default browser then I have to navigate deep into PC settings to change that behavior. That seems like a new security measure to stop apps hijacking the system, but it’s not user friendly at all. Microsoft actively blocks apps from setting themselves as default, so this isn’t even something Google can improve itself. Perhaps the most disappointing part of Edge for me is the lack of extensions. Firefox and Chrome have both supported web extensions for years, and it feels like a miss not to have these available in Edge at launch. However, Microsoft has said these will arrive later this year. For now, I’m begrudgingly sticking with Google Chrome until Microsoft Edge is ready. Microsoft’s Xbox app might be my favorite new feature, because it lets you stream Xbox One games to your laptop. It works surprisingly well, with no lag even over a Wi-Fi network. You simply plug in an Xbox One controller via USB and then connect to your Xbox One and start streaming over a local network. You can also create party chats straight from your laptop with Xbox friends. This is beta at launch, and I’ve found it’s a little hit and miss on successfully connecting you, but once it works the sound quality is great even if you use a built-in microphone on your PC. One of the big additions to the Xbox app for PC gamers is game DVR. You can take screenshots and recordings, generating clips up to two hours in length. If you want to record a tutorial or just something to upload to YouTube, then you can also activate the feature, with options to change audio and video quality, and clips are just stored in MP4 format. It’s a nice secret feature and one less reason to purchase an expensive third-party screen-recording app. Windows 10’s built-in apps are a great complement to the operating system. While Windows 8’s ""Metro-style"" apps were basic and lacking in features, Windows 10’s have mostly everything you’d want. Microsoft’s Maps app provides 3D images, directions, and streetside imagery. It’s all wrapped up in a simple interface with a hamburger menu to access settings and features. Most importantly, these built-in apps no longer run fullscreen by default. It was always irritating to run an app fullscreen on a 30-inch monitor, and you’re no longer forced to do that for any Windows 10 apps. My favorite new app is Mail. Microsoft has taken a lot of the features from its acquisition of Acompli and applied them to this Mail client. There are swipe gestures for touch-based machines and a large reading pane to focus on messages. It all works a lot like Outlook.com, with the support of the Word engine for composing emails. That means writing messages is smooth, and they can be as simple (just text) or complex (tables and pictures) as you want. There are some things missing, like a unified inbox, and a lot of quirks. Occasionally, all the subject lines of my emails disappear randomly, or an account refuses to open. I’m hoping Microsoft can iron out these bugs with an update, because the app is great otherwise. The new calendar app is also great. Although I’d like to see some Cortana integration in the future, the uncluttered interface is exactly what you expect from your calendar. Best of all, Google Calendar is now supported so you can easily add your Gmail account and have it work just fine across email and calendar. You’ll also need to add your Google accounts here to get the Cortana integration across Windows 10 to work, it won’t just fetch information over the web. Microsoft has also finally improved its Photos app to be a lot more useful. Images are automatically corrected, and it does some smart album creation on the fly. I use OneDrive to back up photos from my iPhone automatically, and when I open the Photos app on Windows 10, they’re all there. It’s just like having a Windows Phone, but Microsoft doesn’t care what phone I use. But the most impressive additions are the new stripped-down, touch-based Office apps. Microsoft has labeled them Word, Excel, and PowerPoint Mobile, but they’ll work on any Windows 10 PC. I wrote this entire review using Word Mobile, and it’s just a delight to use. It has a clean UI, it’s super fast, and it has all the basic editing features I need. Likewise, the Excel and PowerPoint Mobile versions are enough for me. I’m sure they’ll be enough for most people who don’t require the full power of Office desktop apps, and the best feature is that they’re free for devices with a 10.1-inch screen or smaller. While we’re discussing apps, it would be remiss not to mention Microsoft’s new Windows Store. Apps, games, music, movies, and TV have all finally been combined into a single place. The goal, eventually, is that developers will write a single app and it will run on your Windows PC, tablet, phone, Xbox One, and the upcoming HoloLens headset. That’s all good news, but the bad news is that there’s still a lack of true quality apps. Microsoft’s built-in apps show what’s possible, and I hope that Windows 10 will finally encourage developers to create better ones. Microsoft is offering Windows 10 free to Windows 7 and Windows 8 users with a view to create a huge install base to attract developers. It’s a wise move, but it might be years until we see the results. While Microsoft is focused on mouse and keyboard computing with Windows 10, it hasn’t forgot about all the good touch work that went into Windows 8. A new tablet mode in Windows 10 aims to bridge the fullscreen world of Windows 8 with the traditional way you use a Windows PC. If you have a 2-in-1 convertible laptop, then you’ll be prompted to enable tablet mode when you physically switch modes from laptop to tablet. Windows 10’s tablet mode simplifies the task bar, makes everything touch-friendly, and brings back the fullscreen Start screen. Overall, it’s a good improvement over the hidden gestures in Windows 8, and it feels a lot easier to use if you’re enabling it for the first time. Microsoft still has some work to do to blend these two modes a little better, but this already feels less jarring than Windows 8. Windows 10’s development has been unique. If you wanted to, you could test public beta versions of the operating system over the past eight months and watch Windows 10 reach its final point. Windows 10 has some great additions over Windows 8 and Windows 7, and it really feels like a good blend of the familiarity of Windows 7 and some of the new features of Windows 8. It’s not irritating to use, and you don’t need a tutorial to find the Start menu. It just works like you’d expect. It’s easy to recommend Windows 10 as an upgrade for anyone on Windows 7 and Windows 8, but maybe not just yet. ""Wait for service pack 1"" has always been the default advice for new versions and Windows, and it absolutely applies here. During my testing on a variety of hardware, I’ve run into a lot of bugs and issues — even with the version that will be released to consumers on launch day. Some range from basic problems like app icons on the task bar disappearing, all the way up to my audio randomly failing or blue screens. I don’t own every PC configuration out there, but as I look at others expressing frustration over these odd issues on Twitter, it’s clear I’m not alone. Even during Microsoft’s review demonstration of Windows 10, a PC rebooted due to a blue screen. Everything about Windows 10 feels like a new approach for Microsoft, and I’m confident these early bugs and issues will be addressed fairly quickly. I’m hoping and expecting that as we approach the holiday season, we’ll see a more finished Windows 10. If you can deal with a few oddities here and there and you’re frustrated with Windows 8, then by all means upgrade now. But if you depend on your Windows computer on a daily basis and it’s working fine for you, you should hold off until everything is a little more polished. Microsoft is rolling out daily updates at the moment, so it might only be a matter of weeks until things are fixed. Windows 10 is a work in progress, and it’s at the early part of its life right now. Windows 10 is hugely exciting. I rarely touch my MacBook Air anymore as I find the combination of some good hardware (like the Dell XPS 13) and Windows 10 is a joy to use. I like the direction Microsoft is taking with Windows 10, accepting feedback and ideas from its customers along the way. It feels like the best way to shape Windows into something people enjoy using, rather than something they have to use. That’s the nature of the Windows cycle: bad version, then a good version. Windows 10 is a great fix to the problems of Windows 8, and that’s exactly what we all expected. But what about the next version? Oddly, Microsoft says there won’t really be one. This is the ""last Windows"" and Microsoft will be iterating on it for the coming years. Assuming Microsoft can kill the bugs in this initial release, it’s going to make computers better for billions of people. The best part of Windows 10 is that it ends the cycle of good and bad in favor of something great. Lead image and photos of Microsoft Edge, Cortana, and Xbox app by Chris Welch.

It started off with the Moto X Style, a 5.7-inch phone that it basically claimed would have a camera that could rival the iPhone's. Next was the Moto X Play, a 5.5-inch device with an enormous battery. Finally, there was the the new Moto G, which has good looks, LTE, and supposedly a decent camera all for a price below $200 off contract. While the lineup is pretty straightforward — high-end (Style), mid-range (Play), low-end (G) — Motorola's sales strategy is anything but. The Moto G is available widely, launching in 60 countries today, including the US. The Play will be available in August in Europe, Latin America, and Canada, but it won't be coming to the US. The Style will have a similar launch in September. It's coming to the US, but under a different name: the Moto X Pure Edition. The Pure Edition is by all accounts the same phone, only it'll be sold off contract and able to work with any carrier. These phones aren't all fighting for the same turf — especially the Moto G — but Motorola is clear about positioning these up against the best of the best. It even borrowed Apple's ""Shot on iPhone"" style when demonstrating the quality of its cameras. In the chart below, we've put together a comparison of how Motorola's new phones look on paper against the two newest iPhones and the Galaxy S6. In a lot of ways, they compare pretty favorably, with big batteries and lower prices. They don't always win on power alone, but that's why it'll matter much more how these phones — and particularly their cameras — handle when put to the test.

The nurse was involved in the care of Thomas Duncan, a man who arrived in Dallas from Liberia before showing symptoms of the disease. A hospital official said the healthcare worker was ""following full CDC precautions,"" including a mask, gloves, gown, and face shield while caring for Duncan when he arrived at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital's emergency room on September 28th. ""Clearly, there was a breach in protocol."" At a press conference in Atlanta this morning, CDC director Tom Frieden said that ""clearly, there was a breach in protocol,"" adding that the agency will ""undertake a thorough investigation to understand how this may have happened."" The patient has been identified as a nurse who had ""extensive contact"" with Thomas Duncan, though she was not included on a list of 48 people who were under monitoring by the CDC following Duncan's original diagnosis. The agency, Frieden explained, had ruled out health care workers who came in contact with the patient after September 28th, when he was placed into isolation. In extended remarks, Frieden added, ""It is certainly very concerning, and it tells us that there is a need to enhance the training and protocols and to make sure that the protocols are followed. The protocols work. We have decades of experience caring for patients with Ebola, but we know that even a single lapse or breach … can result in infection."" The CDC has performed its own tests to confirm that the nurse indeed has Ebola. It is unclear how the disease spread considering the precautions that were taken. Daniel Varga, chief clinical officer of Texas Health Resources, which runs the hospital, said ""We’re very concerned."" It's possible that the worker contracted the disease while removing the suit — a nursing assistant in Spain who tested positive for the virus last week after caring for an Ebola patient there suggested she got the disease from her protective gear. Her case is the first transmission of the disease outside of Africa. ""It is not news that should bring about panic.""  The worker in Texas had been under voluntary self monitoring after coming in contact with Duncan, though she was not labeled a ""high risk,"" Varga told reporters. Self-monitoring includes taking one's temperature twice daily. After reporting a fever on Friday, the nurse was immediately admitted to an isolation room at the hospital, and an Ebola test came in positive on Saturday night. Hazmat crews were then deployed to decontaminate the area where the worker lives, and officials began the process of tracking down anyone who had been in contact with the person. Varga noted that ""The system of monitoring, quarantine and isolation was established to protect those who cared for Mr Duncan as well as the community at large by identifying any potential Ebola cases as early as possible and getting those individuals into treatment immediately."" That system worked as planned here. Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins said, ""We expected that it was possible that a second person could contract the virus. Contingency plans were put into place ... which will make our jobs in monitoring and containment much easier in this case than in the last one."" He added, ""while this is obviously bad news, it is not news that should bring about panic.""

At the time of the announcement, the nurse — now identified as 26-year-old Nina Pham — had already been placed in isolation and was being treated for Ebola in Dallas, Texas. But in a conference call today, Tom Frieden, the CDC’s director, admitted that the CDC still doesn’t know how Pham contracted the disease while wearing protective gear recommended by the agency. ""If we knew that there was specific incident, such as a needlestick, then that means we could narrow it down to workers who have that kind of exposure,"" Frieden says. ""But since we don’t know we need to cast the net more widely,"" and look at every aspect of treatment — including how health care workers don and remove their protective equipment. This is especially important because taking off protective gear safely isn’t exactly easy and ""even a single, innocent, inadvertent slip can result in contamination,"" Frieden says.  .@semiotic_pirate I did it once as a training exercise and yeah, hopeless. needs practice, and probably support/buddy/overseer at time? According to the CDC, a health care worker has to remove four pieces of equipment immediately after leaving an isolation unit. Given the amount of items involved, taking them off might not seem like a particularly difficult process, but the key thing to remember here is that the order in which this is done (there are actually two suggested methods) is a matter of life and death.     The World Health Organization, on the other hand, breaks the whole process down in  a series of  eight or nine steps, depending on whether a healthcare worker is wearing boots. These steps are pretty much the same as the CDC's, however. And again, the order in which they take place is crucial.   Because of the complexity of the process, many hospitals and treatment centers around the world have implemented a ""buddy system,"" where a second person oversees the removal of protective gear to make sure healthcare professionals don't accidentally touch a gloved hand to their face, for instance. Moreover, rooms in hospitals are typically designed to make the rules as easy to follow as possible. Shelves, for example, are placed in areas that nurses and doctors are unlikely to frequent as they make their way to the sink, writes Maryn McKenna over at Wired. ""Even a single, innocent, inadvertent slip can result in contamination."" There’s a lot of room for error, but the thing to remember here is that these procedures work. Every Ebola outbreak that has occurred until now has been contained, and that’s in no small part because of the care that was taken during the removal of hazardous materials from treatment sites. Of course, there’s always room for improvement. Frieden notes that the decontamination process in Dallas includes spraying medical gloves with a product that can kill the virus. But now that Pham has tested positive for Ebola, the CDC is examining the possibility of spraying medical gowns before their removal as well. ""The bottom line is that the care of Ebola is hard,"" Frieden says. But ""the control of Ebola is already something we know how to do.""

Yet that's exactly what two of Silicon Valley's largest companies are doing in real life in an apparent bid to recruit more women talent, a laudable goal. Facebook and Apple will both cover the costs of egg-freezing procedures up to $20,000 for individual employees, according to NBC News. Facebook's employees were able to participate in the policy as of this year, while Apple's policy won't be available until early 2015, according to the report.  The cost of egg freezing is up to $10,000 per cycle Egg freezing (technically called ""oocyte cryopreservation"") as an elective process is still a relatively new trend, first pioneered in humans in 1986. It is designed to allow a woman to attempt to have children past her most fertile years (20-35, according to Mayo Clinic). The process generally involves having a woman in her peak fertile years take hormones to produce more mature eggs than the one that would result naturally during her menstrual cycle, up to 45 eggs, according to the NYU Fertility Center. The mature eggs are then extracted or harvested in a procedure that takes 10 to 15 minutes under sedation, and the healthy eggs are then frozen in a fertility clinic and kept until a woman wants to have a child, up to 10 years, at which point they are unfrozen and fertilized with sperm, then re-implanted into a woman's uterus. The technology hasn't been very reliable and was until recently considered experimental. It is also expensive, costing around $10,000 per cycle or ""round"" of egg production, so the Facebook and Apple contributions could be extremely helpful for younger adult women who want this procedure.  Advocates of the technology have applauded Facebook's and Apple's support, and the overall effort to attract more women employees in the predominantly white male workforces of both companies is certainly commendable. But there are several concerns worth raising: one is that egg freezing is still not a very reliable way of getting pregnant, and thus still isn't recommended for ""career women"" by The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. Another is that it puts the onus on women to decide when to have kids, yet men's sperm quality also declines with age and sperm storage is far cheaper. It also would seem to encourage delaying childbirth and reinforce a workplace culture that isn't supportive of childrearing earlier in people's careers. Facebook and Apple, both of which already offer some childcare support, may find that their money is better spent investing in more flexible work/life options for their employees at all stages of life.",0.561532613416986,0.438467386583014,0.8839894022088498,487,5.0800821355236137,281,6.1779359430604979,0,0,"Apple, Science, Tech",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The compact fusion reactor, or CFR, is (at least in theory) safer, cleaner, and more powerful than existing nuclear reactors, according to an Aviation Week article. It's much harder to use fuel required for fusion to build weapons Fusion happens when two or more high-energy atoms collide, creating a new atomic nucleus and releasing a great deal of energy, provided that the atoms being crunched together have a lower atomic mass than iron. It's how the sun shines: by slamming together high-energy hydrogen particles, and in so doing, creating helium atoms. It's the opposite of fission, which splits an atom apart to release energy. Fission is how the bombs dropped on Japan during World War II worked; the first energy-releasing reactor in the US was built in Idaho by Argonne National Lab and started operation in 1951. It's much harder to use the nuclear fuel required for fusion to build weapons, and atomic scientists have called for further exploration of fusion power. Lockheed appears to have obliged. Most existing fusion devices slam together atoms using a tokamak, a magnetic device that contains the superheated plasma required for fusion to occur. Invented in the Soviet Union in the 1950s, it's what most nuclear fusion devices use. The problem is, the energy required to sustain the reaction is almost as much as what's created by the reaction. The research field is littered with failures Lockheed says they've figured out how to solve that problem, using their CFR, a jet-engine-sized device. They've changed the process for holding the plasma in a way they say has 10 times the output of a tokamak.They also say there's no risk of a meltdown, and that radioactive waste will be considerably lessened. No prototype has been built or tested yet, though, and this research field is littered with failures, despite millions of dollars of investment. The most notable is ""cold fusion"" — when, in 1989, Martin Fleischmann and Stanley Pons, working at the University of Utah, claimed they had achieved fusion in a simple tabletop device working at room temperature. However, no one who tried to reproduce their experiment was successful, and the finding was discredited. Physicists often joke that widespread use of nuclear fusion energy has been 40 years away every single decade since the 1970s. Lockheed says its new device will be ready for prime time in 10 years, and that a prototype will be developed in 5. We'll see.

In a statement released early Wednesday morning, the Texas Department of State Health Services said that the worker ""reported a fever Tuesday and was immediately isolated"" at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas. Today's announcement comes after another nurse at the same hospital was diagnosed with Ebola, which marked the first known transmission of the disease in the US. Both workers were providing care for Thomas Duncan, who died from Ebola after returning to the US from a trip to Liberia. Officials said yesterday that the first health care worker, 26-year-old Nina Pham, is receiving treatment and in good condition, though it remains unclear how she contracted the disease, which spreads through direct contact with the body fluids of an infected patient. The second worker, who has not been named, has been interviewed to identify any others who may have been exposed, and those people will be monitored. ""it is certainly very concerning."" In a statement issued today, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) described the second diagnosis as a ""serious concern"" and said that confirmation testing is underway at its laboratories. ""As we have said before, because of our ongoing investigation, it is not unexpected that there would be additional exposures,"" the agency said. Tom Frieden, director of the CDC, said earlier this week that the diagnosis of the first health care worker suggested a clear ""breach in protocol."" ""It is certainly very concerning, and it tells us that there is a need to enhance the training and protocols and to make sure that the protocols are followed,"" Frieden said in a press conference Sunday. ""The protocols work. We have decades of experience caring for patients with Ebola, but we know that even a single lapse or breach … can result in infection."" Update, 8:24AM ET: Daniel Varga, Chief Clinical Officer at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital, inadvertently admitted during a news conference this morning that the latest health care worker to become infected with Ebola is a woman. Officials have not revealed her identity or what position she holds at the hospital, however.   Varga also said that his hospital could have done things differently, but failed to explain how two hospital employees contracted Ebola. ""We are looking at every element of our personal protective equipment. We don't have an answer for this right now, but we are looking at every angle,"" he said. ""No one wants to get things right more than our hospital."" Update, 9:43AM ET: The CDC has announced stricter equipment guidelines for health professionals treating Ebola patients. According to Bloomberg, Workers at the Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital must now wear hoods that will cover their necks. They must also make sure they wash their hands in a specific sequence. These measures are reminiscent of those enforced by Doctors Without Borders, which requires its workers to don equipment that doesn't leave skin exposed. But the CDC's newest guidelines still differ from those imposed by Doctors Without Borders, as the US agency requires that its workers wear a single pair of gloves. Doctors Without Borders asks for two. Doubling up on gloves, explained CDC direct Tom Frieden earlier this week poses a risk because the practice makes gloves harder to remove. Update, 11:28AM ET: The CDC is reporting that the second health care worker took a flight on Monday, the day before she began showing Ebola symptoms.

Last week, ZeniMax said that the Oculus Rift VR headset couldn't have existed without help from John Carmack, who it accuses of giving Oculus intellectual property developed at and owned by ZeniMax. Carmack, who co-founded id but left to work at Oculus last year, was an early supporter of Oculus, and Oculus has previously acknowledged his support. But it says that ZeniMax played no part in the process and actually impeded VR development. ""There is not a line of ZeniMax code or any of its technology in any Oculus products,"" says Oculus in a statement, and Carmack ""did not take any intellectual property from ZeniMax."" Instead, the company accuses ZeniMax of making misleading and vague claims. ZeniMax has cited a non-disclosure agreement that Oculus founder Palmer Luckey signed in 2012, in which it bars Luckey from using or claiming ownership of unspecified VR software. According to Oculus, ZeniMax ""has misstated the purposes and language"" of the document and has ""never identified any ‘stolen' code or technology"" in the company's publicly available source code. ""There is not a line of ZeniMax code or any of its technology in any Oculus products."" The company also refutes allegations that ZeniMax had attempted to get compensation for stolen intellectual property well before Facebook bought Oculus for $2 billion last month. ""Zenimax did not pursue claims against Oculus for IP or technology,"" it says, ""and only after the Facebook deal was announced has Zenimax now made these claims through its lawyers."" It also points out that Carmack has previously said he left id because ZeniMax wasn't interested in VR development. One of the most interesting claims, though, is that a financial spat with ZeniMax is the reason that Doom 3 BFG never ended up supporting VR. Doom 3 was one of the first games tested with the Rift, and it was supposed to be one of the very first games released for it — every development kit, in fact, was supposed to come with a copy. That plan was later scrapped. ZeniMax claims that it previously attempted to settle with Oculus over intellectual property, asking for equity in the company. Though Oculus maintains that there were no intellectual property disputes involved, it confirms that some kind of negotiation happened, saying that ZeniMax canceled VR support for Doom 3 when Oculus refused to grant it equity. Since the legal threat was made public, Oculus has characterized ZeniMax's claims as the standard fee-chasing that companies see during an acquisition.

Nintendo expects to return to the black in its 2014 fiscal year, forecasting an operating profit of ¥40 billion ($394 million) with 3.6m Wii U and 12m 3DS consoles sold. Shareholders may not take the claim at face value, though — CEO and president Satoru Iwata maintained until January that the company would make ¥100 billion profit in 2013, before backtracking dramatically and predicting a ¥35 billion loss on poor Wii U sales. As it turned out, Iwata underestimated the loss by more than ¥11 billion. Nintendo expects to return to the black in 2014 ""Nintendo will focus on efforts that seek to stimulate the platform,"" the company said in its release, promising to expand Wii U sales ""by providing software that takes advantage of the Wii U GamePad, utilizing its built-in functionality as an NFC reader/writer, and adding Nintendo DS Virtual Console titles to the Wii U software lineup."" If 'Mario Kart 8' doesn't sell systems, what will? Despite the release of the excellent Super Mario 3D World, the Wii U software situation hasn't improved a great deal, and Nintendo needs to pick up the pace. This month sees the release of Mario Kart 8, the latest entry in a franchise which is as close to a guaranteed system-seller as anything in Nintendo's stable; the Wii version sold over 34 million units, and Mario Kart 7 for 3DS has sold over 8 million copies to date. Mario Kart 8's release will leave Super Smash Bros. as the only major first-party Wii U title on the calendar, however, and Nintendo will be expected to reveal a convincing software lineup over next month's E3 conference. One thing's for sure — if Mario Kart 8 doesn't perform, it's hard to imagine what might convince customers to pick up a Wii U.",0.3700989216180502,0.6299010783819499,0.5070573363152048,449,4.7772828507795104,257,5.6731517509727629,0,0,"Business, Gaming",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

The accusations come from Level 3, a communications company that helps connect large-scale ISPs like Comcast or AT&T to the rest of the internet. According to the company, these six unnamed ISPs are deliberately degrading the quality of internet services using the Level 3 network, in an attempt to get Level 3 to pay them a fee for additional traffic caused by services like Netflix, a process known as paid peering.  ""They are not allowing us to fulfill the requests their customers make for content."" ""They are deliberately harming the service they deliver to their paying customers,"" writes Level 3's Mark Taylor. ""They are not allowing us to fulfill the requests their customers make for content."" While Taylor doesn't name names, he describes the six offenders as ""large broadband consumer networks with a dominant or exclusive market share in their local market."" He adds that ""in countries or markets where consumers have multiple broadband choices (like the UK) there are no congested peers."" He also says that Level 3 won't be paying up. ""Our policy is to refuse to pay arbitrary charges to add interconnection capacity,"" he explains. The situation recalls recent claims by Netflix that Comcast is intentionally throttling traffic with intermediaries like Level 3 and Cogent, a problem that Netflix says ultimately led it to start signing direct traffic deals — Comcast and Verizon have been paid so far, with more likely to come. Since the Comcast deal, Netflix says its streaming speeds on Comcast have increased 65 percent. But despite the performance improvement, Netflix doesn't appear happy about the arrangement.

But they will soon. Last year there was over $240 billion in sales on Alibaba, more than Amazon and eBay combined. On Black Friday of last year, Alibaba sold $5.75 billion in goods. That’s three times more money transacted in a single day than all of America spent on all US shopping sites combined across Thanksgiving and Black Friday. The public offering is expected to be one of the largest in history, valuing the company at $150 billion or more. With the money it collects from an IPO Alibaba has plans not just to dominate China, but to take on titans like Amazon with the launch of its own US marketplace. More sales than Amazon and eBay combined Alibaba is the brainchild of Jack Ma, an eccentric entrepreneur whose reputation in China is akin to a Steve Jobs or Jeff Bezos. He was rejected from college both at home and abroad more than a dozen times before finally securing a spot at a local university in his hometown of Hangzhou, where he studied English. During a trip to Seattle in 1995 he learned about the internet and returned home determined to build an online business. He created China Pages, a directory and portal that was one of the earliest websites in the country, but it was ahead of its time and not much of a success. Four years later he had left that company behind to start Alibaba out of his small apartment. At first Alibaba’s business was a marketplace connecting American merchants with Chinese suppliers. It quickly expanded into retail with Taoboa, where 8 million small merchants now list their items. It then went upscale with Tmall, a shopping site where big brands such as Disney, Apple, and Nike host virtual shops for Chinese consumers. Like Amazon, Alibaba has a diverse array of other businesses. It is a shipping company, cloud-services provider, and payment processor. It has even begun experimenting with banking, making loans to the same small merchants who sell on its marketplace. The company has been growing at a phenomenal rate. According to its IPO filing with the SEC, Alibaba made over $6.5 billion dollars in revenue during the last nine months of 2013, nearly half of which was profit. Alibaba's profit margins dwarf those at American e-commerce companies American companies like eBay also had their eyes on China’s huge customer base and rapidly expanding middle class. In 2003 Meg Whitman led the charge with a $150 million purchase of the Chinese e-commerce company Each-net, an acquisition that gave eBay control of 85 percent of China’s online shopping activity. Alibaba had far fewer resources, but a much better grasp of the local market. By 2005 the companies were neck and neck. Whitman approached Ma about a possible partnership, but he decided to take a $1 billion investment from Yahoo instead. By 2006, Alibaba had passed eBay to become China’s biggest e-commerce company. That same year eBay bowed out of the Chinese market.    The biggest challenge for Alibaba as it looks to crack the US market will be trust. Alibaba has been criticized before for allowing shady merchants to promote defective or counterfeit goods on its sites. Unlike most e-commerce companies around the world, Alibaba does not allow search engines like Google to index its wares. So customers must go directly to its  websites and search there. Alibaba lets merchants list for free on sites like Taobao, but it charges them a premium if they want their goods promoted in its search engine. This has led to criticisms that customers are being pushed inferior products, and in fact at one point the Office of the US Trade Representative labeled its sites as ""notorious markets,"" a designation it has since removed. Alibaba has struggled with fraud In its IPO filing Alibaba writes about this issue, noting that, ""The first risk Alibaba displays, which typically means its most important for investors, is the 'trusted status of our ecosystem' ... If we fail to balance the interests of all participants in our ecosystem, buyers, sellers and other participants may stop visiting our marketplaces, conduct fewer transactions or use alternative platforms…"" David Pakman, a tech investor with Venrock who lives in New York, has used Alibaba a few times in recent years. He said that trust was definitely an issue for him at first, but that in the end price won out. ""I was looking for professional-grade theatrical lasers,"" says Pakman, to be part of a DJ setup. ""I found them for sale in the US at very high prices and just assumed they were probably made in China. I searched Alibaba and found all of the exact same units direct from the manufacturers at 10 percent of the price on US sites."" While the intention may not be to compete with US merchants, says Pakman, ""they will be showing people exactly what the markup is when you shop at an American seller.""  ""The exact same units direct from the manufacturers at 10 percent of the price.""For Amazon, which has built its business on being able to undercut the competition, the arrival of Alibaba, and its hordes of Chinese manufacturers willing to sell direct, is a frightening prospect. Alibaba already does business in Russia and Brazil and is working on an American marketplace it’s calling 11 Main. When he was battling the much larger eBay in China, Jack Ma famously said that ""eBay is a shark in the ocean. We are a crocodile in the Yangtze River. If we fight in the ocean we will lose, but if we fight in the river we will win."" Alibaba proved it could defeat larger, more established Silicon Valley rivals on its home turf. Now it's venturing into the ocean to see if it can’t swim with the sharks after all.",0.6407206675535038,0.35927933244649624,0.8800643719424205,1000,4.7969999999999997,511,5.904109589041096,0,0,"Business, Report",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

But a proposal may not be imminent; just yesterday, DirecTV CEO Mike White looked to steer the conversation away from ""possible transactions that might involve DirecTV."" During a media conference call, White emphasized that the Journal's report wasn't based on ""official"" sources of information. ""We don't view it as productive to speculate about alternative business combinations which may or may not occur."" It might not be productive, but the rumor is hard to ignore — especially in light of Comcast's ongoing pursuit of Time Warner Cable. AT&T and DirecTV may not have entered talks in the first place if not for Comcast's mega purchase. White has already stated that regulators should leave no stone unturned in scrutinizing that deal.

This is actually the SEC's second cryptocurrency-related alert. The first was issued last summer after the agency prosecuted a man for running a pyramid scheme in the virtual currency. Meanwhile, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) recently issued a similar alert, while the North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA) added virtual currencies to its list of top 10 investor threats for 2013. The SEC issues investor alerts a few times a year about popular schemes that cause people to part with their money. ""A new product, technology, or innovation – such as bitcoin – has the potential to give rise both to frauds and high-risk investment opportunities,"" the agency says. ""Potential investors can be easily enticed with the promise of high returns in a new investment space and also may be less skeptical when assessing something novel, new and cutting-edge."" ""Potential investors can be easily enticed with the promise of high returns."" There are a few reasons why virtual currencies are especially risky, the SEC says. Most cryptocurrencies have irreversible transactions, which can make it more difficult to recover money. The services that function as banks for virtual currencies are also not required to have insurance. Meanwhile, fraudsters have identified the virtual currency community as a ripe target. The SEC also notes that bitcoin and other currencies are very volatile, vulnerable to hackers, and may be restricted by governments. ""As a recent invention, Bitcoin does not have an established track record of credibility and trust,"" the agency says. There is no shortage of horror stories about people who have lost money investing in bitcoin and other virtual currencies. The recent closure of the Japan-based Mt Gox exchange resulted in frozen accounts with no guarantee of reimbursement.

Omari sent a picture of the search warrant to The Daily Dot, and said that police took ""everything,"" including his Xbox One, phones, laptops, and USB sticks. Security expert Brian Krebs had previously identified Omari — who appeared in an interview for Sky News as a ""security analyst"" commenting on the PSN and Xbox Live downtime — as a member of Lizard Squad.

While the MPAA and others have launched lawsuits against US-based infringers, reaching offshore torrent sites like Isohunt and The Pirate Bay is still a slow process, and whenever a site is taken down, others quickly pop up to fill its place. As a result, the MPAA has consistently pushed for the power to block infringing sites from the internet: first by pushing for new laws like SOPA in 2011, then through a series of novel legal tactics. The fight has pitted them against some of the most powerful companies on the web, and drawn them into a long, secret battle with Google. A little-known legal venue that's poised to take on new digital powers But leaked documents show that Hollywood has a new secret weapon in the fight, a little-known legal venue that's poised to take on new powers over the digital realm. It's called the International Trade Commission, a quasi-judicial agency that regulates imported goods as they enter the country. Traditionally, that means physical goods — if you want to ship in a boatload of fake iPhones, the ITC is the agency that will stop you — but the ITC recently gave itself the power to rule on data as it crosses US borders, as a result of a complex 3D printing case. If the ruling holds, it could have huge implications for the way data moves across the global web, and give the MPAA the site-blocking powers it’s been grasping at for years. The heart of the case is a company called ClearCorrect, which 3D prints clear plastic braces custom-designed for each patient's teeth. Much of the technology involved in the process is already under patent, but ClearCorrect has gotten around those patents by farming out its intricate computer modeling to an office in Pakistan. That modeling violates a number of US patents — and if ClearCorrect were shipping back the resulting braces in a box, it would be a simple case: the goods would be contraband, to be stopped at the border. But instead, ClearCorrect is only transmitting digital models from Pakistan and printing out the braces in local offices in Texas. The only thing coming in from Pakistan is raw modeling data. So what's a trade commission to do? Enforcing import controls on data would require powerful new tools In April of last year, the ITC arrived at an answer with huge repercussions: stop the data at the border. The ITC is only supposed to rule on ""articles,"" which has usually been taken to mean physical goods, but last year’s ruling took it to include data too. That gives the ITC the power to stop ClearCorrect's contraband braces data at the border, but it could have far greater implications. If a web service like Gmail or Facebook ends up on the wrong side of a patent dispute, the court could potentially forbid the service from transmitting data into the US until the dispute is resolved — making the cost of a losing a court battle astronomically higher. It would also require powerful new tools for monitoring data as it crosses national borders, a fundamental break from the international structure of the web. Aware of the huge issues at stake, the ITC stayed the ruling until the Federal Circuit weighs in later this year — but already, legal groups are reeling from the possible consequences. The MPAA has taken particular interest in the case, seeing the ITC as its best chance to stop pirated content in transit. Documents obtained in the wake of the Sony hack show MPAA lawyers already mapping out a way to turn the ruling to their advantage. ""Seeking a site-blocking order in the ITC would appear to offer a number advantages over federal court litigation,"" one memo (embedded below) reads. ""This now seems even more so given the ITC's recent decision (albeit now on appeal)."" The MPAA has also filed two public briefs (available here) to this effect, supporting the ITC’s new authority over data. If you shipped in a boatload of DVDs, the ITC would have no problem stopping it at the border — so why not an ISO file? The logic is easy to follow. If you shipped in a boatload of Expendables DVDs, the ITC would have no problem stopping it at the border — so why not an ISO file? The technical mechanisms for blocking that file in transit would end up looking a lot like site-blocking, and the memo goes on to explain why targeting consumer-facing ISPs would be their best strategy in the wake of a favorable ruling by the Federal Circuit. It's still unclear whether copyright would fall under the same rules (the current ruling may only apply to patents), but if it does, it would be Hollywood's best legal channel for blocking sites in transit, supporting the same ISP-based blocking regime that was proposed by SOPA. The ITC is a particularly appealing tool for groups like the MPAA because of its strong legal powers and logistical benefits. The ITC usually processes cases faster than federal courts, and trying a case there requires specific legal expertise that gives big companies a kind of home-field advantage. More importantly, if the ITC rules that a particular product is infringing, the company is immediately barred from importing it — a much stronger ruling than most federal courts will ever hand down. That has particularly striking implications for the web, where stopping data in transit is easier said than done. Instead of a monetary settlement, the ITC's infringement penalties would mean preventing sites from sending data into the US entirely. The threat of legal action might be all it takes to block a site As with SOPA, the biggest concern is what content owners can do without ever going to court. As long as there's a credible case, the simple threat of legal action against ISPs may be all that's required to take something down. Most ISPs have little stake in the specific sites that travel over their network, and faced with the prospect of a long, expensive legal battle, they'll have no desire to raise trouble. Furthermore,  simply building the infrastructure to comply with the requests may require serious changes to the structure of the web. Public Knowledge's Charles Duan has written a brief for the Federal Circuit pushing exactly this case, claiming that giving the ITC free rein over data would inevitably lead to easy site-blocking procedures. ""If this is a successful technique, it's basically going to require ISPs to build in all sorts of systems that would make it very easy for someone to take something down very very quickly,"" says Duan. A fundamental change to how data is routed through the web It's not just web freedom advocates that are worried. The courts have also heard from the Internet Association, a trade group representing web giants like Google, Facebook, and Amazon, on the grounds that the ITC's new powers might result in major problems for cloud computing. (Google has also filed a separate brief challenging the ruling.) Running a high-traffic service like Netflix or Google Drive means having servers all around the world and routing traffic based on which server has the lowest load. If companies are exposing themselves to a legal challenge every time they send data across US borders, it would require massive changes to the existing server infrastructure, as well as a fundamental rethinking of the way data is routed through the web. Since vicious  patent fights are already common within the tech industry, the prospect of stopping patent-infringing software as it crosses the border is seen as particularly dangerous. ""The cloud presents enormous economies of scale,"" said Abigail Slater, the Internet Association's VP of legal and regulatory policy. ""But the cloud can only deliver these benefits by being able to operate seamlessly around the globe."" While the stakes are high, we won’t get a clear answer from the courts until late in 2015 at the earliest. The Federal Circuit will be hearing arguments well into the summer, and it may take months beyond that to finally issue a ruling. If the Federal Circuit’s ruling is appealed — as it likely will be — the Supreme Court could take years to settle the issue. In the meantime, lawyers on both sides are left to plead their case and cross their fingers. For web freedom advocates like Duan, it’s easy to see the case as a pre-electronic model of trade that's come smashing into the internet era. As Duan puts it, ""it feels like the FAA deciding they want to regulate radio because it's sent over the air.""

Electronic filing systems have become the norm in lower courts, but are still in the midst of being overhauled to make accessing documents feel like like you're stuck in the 1990s. Then there's the Supreme Court, which still relies on paper filings, which need to be scanned and distributed by others like the Scotusblog for public consumption. That will change sometime in 2016, Chief Justice John Roberts said today. Writing in a year-end report on the Federal Judiciary, Roberts said the court was developing its own electronic filing system to help it escape the clutches of paper, and freely host major documents for the public to see — at least eventually. ""Initially, the official filing of documents will continue to be on paper for all parties in all cases, with the electronic submission an additional requirement for parties represented by attorneys,"" Roberts wrote. ""Once the system has operated effectively for some time and the Supreme Court Bar has become well acquainted with it, the Court expects that electronic filing will be the official means for all parties represented by counsel, but paper filings will still be required."" ""The courts cannot decide to serve only the most technically-capable or well-equipped segments of the public."" Why not jettison paper altogether? Roberts says the goal is to be as diplomatic as possible given the amount of access some people may or may not have, and that the court doesn't want to add potential barriers to people who aren't tech savvy. ""Unlike commercial enterprises, the courts cannot decide to serve only the most technically-capable or well-equipped segments of the public,"" Roberts wrote. ""Indeed, the courts must remain open for those who do not have access to personal computers and need to file in paper, rather than electronic, form."" The annual review, which was spotted by The New York Times, makes no mention of any other technological endeavors, including opening up the court to cameras. That's long been a heated issue, with efforts to make footage of Supreme Court arguments available to the public, with the court arguing that it could change the dynamic of how it comes to decisions. Roberts was keen to note that the Court has not historically been speedy about embracing new technology, a track record that includes the use of pneumatic tubes to deliver paperwork from office to office. In fact, it took the court 42 years to implement such a system after hearing about it in an 1893 article in The Washington Post. ""The courts will often choose to be late to the harvest of American ingenuity,"" he said. ""While courts routinely consider evidence and issue decisions concerning the latest technological advances, they have proceeded cautiously when it comes to adopting new technologies in certain aspects of their own operations.""",0.4133810993248794,0.5866189006751206,0.24159402591259152,496,5.074596774193548,277,6.1083032490974727,0,0,"Policy & Law, Tech, US & World",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

In a legal complaint filed yesterday in California, Miami residents Paul Orshan and Christopher Endara say that the 16GB iPhones and iPads they purchased had less than that amount of usable space, something Orshan contends was further reduced after upgrading his iPhone 5S from iOS 7 to iOS 8. ""Rather ironically, Apple touts iOS 8 as 'The biggest iOS release ever.'"" The lawsuit makes clear that Apple notes the size of a gigabyte after it's been formatted by system software. But it also argues that Apple's iOS system software then takes up another large chunk of the space, reducing the usable space more when upgrading to iOS 8. ""Apple’s misrepresentations and omissions are deceptive and misleading because they omit material facts that an average consumer would consider in deciding whether to purchase its products,"" the complaint says. ""Rather ironically, Apple touts iOS 8 as 'The biggest iOS release ever.' Of course, Apple is not referring to the literal size of iOS 8, which appears to be entirely undisclosed in its voluminous marketing materials extolling the purported virtues of iOS 8."" According to the complaint, the out of the box size discrepancy works out like this on some of Apple's newer devices, ranging from 18.1 to 23.1 percent:   The complaint, which seeks class action status for others who purchased 16GB devices, further accuses Apple pushing users to its paid iCloud storage plans to store things like photos when they run out of room on the device. It also accuses Apple of not working with third-party storage vendors and desktop file transfer utilities for customers to be able to offload their files. ""Using these sharp business tactics, [Apple] gives less storage capacity than advertised, only to offer to sell that capacity in a desperate moment, e.g., when a consumer is trying to record or take photos at a child or grandchild’s recital, basketball game or wedding,"" it says. ""To put this in context, each gigabyte of storage Apple shortchanges its customers amounts to approximately 400-500 high resolution photographs."" Apple, which is not commenting on this complaint, has been sued over this before, notably over the amount of advertised storage in iPods in 2007 (which was ultimately dismissed). The big difference there is that the complaint was lodged over an 8GB iPod Nano only having 7.45GB of usable storage, which is just a 7.5 percent difference. It could be far worse.

The Xbox One is about to look a lot like a gaming PC, and that's really exciting. Since the Xbox One was announced, we've seen a move towards bringing the couch experience of consoles and the rich flexibility of gaming PCs together in a single package. Valve is tackling the problem by starting with the PC and trying to make it more friendly for the living room, but its Steam Machines haven't quite cracked the formula yet. Microsoft is coming from the opposite direction, starting with a console and making it more like a PC, and it's doing a better job.  Microsoft announced three big features for the Xbox One Today, Microsoft announced three big features coming to the Xbox One: backwards compatibility with Xbox 360 games, access to games that are still in development, and free PC modifications for Fallout 4. These features — extensive compatibility with old games, early access to games still in development, and free game modifications — are all things PC gamers currently enjoy. Modifications are especially important, since access to free game changing mods is one of the most valuable exclusive features offered by PC gaming. The new features won't give the Xbox One parity with gaming PCs, and we're not sure if free mods in Fallout 4 means that Microsoft will offer mod support to other games, but taken together they're signs that the arbitrary barrier between consoles and PCs is quickly disappearing.

Motorola's ""cheap"" phone can't really be called low-end anymore. Like a car that got introduced as a value machine, it has steadily increased in power and features until it's become solidly a mid-range Android phone now — one that's still impressive. But what does ""mid-range Android phone"" even mean in 2015? The ever-changing and ever-more-complicated striations in the Android market are hard to keep track of, so let's break it down. It has a 13-megapixel camera partially borrowed from the Nexus 6, 5-inch 720p Gorilla Glass display, 2GB of RAM (in the 16GB model), a quad-core Snapdragon 410 processor, and the latest version of Android. You can get one in multiple storage sizes (8GB or 16GB), and in multiple colors thanks to Moto Maker. It's also water resistant and can work with two SIM cards in some markets.  All that adds up to a phone that not only competes with top-tier phones from only a couple of years ago, it competes now as a phone that's more than powerful enough for most people. And it also now feels more premium than ever. It's not flawless; the display doesn't really stand out, for one, and it lacks the battery life of Motorola's true flagships. But this is by far the best feeling Moto G ever — the back is metal — and Motorola's most successful phone could be due for a big year if consumers take notice. You can purchase it starting today from Moto Maker, Amazon, or Best Buy for $179 (8GB/1GB RAM) or $219 (16GB/2GB RAM) and it'll be in Best Buy retail stores on August 2nd.

The Moto X didn't have the best specs on the market, but it did have something virtually no other phone had: customizability. The Moto Maker store let buyers pick the color of the phone's backplate and accents, eventually adding options like a bamboo case. Motorola followed up with the Moto G, perhaps the cheapest usable smartphone on the market. We're now on the third generation of Moto phones, and Motorola didn't have many surprises for us at its event today — especially since most of the details leaked out beforehand. It announced three new but widely expected phones at different price tiers, all of which will come out between now and September. But it's also trying to fix some of the fundamental problems that have held Android phones back.   Motorola isn’t exactly shaking up the look of its phones. The new Moto X Style uses very similar design language to its predecessor, though it’s a little larger, with a 5.7-inch screen instead of a 5.2-inch one. But that’s a good thing, because the Moto X’s problems were never aesthetics. Motorola is focusing on shoring up basic features like the battery, which it claims will charge 50 percent faster than the Samsung Galaxy S6. It’s got universal LTE banding, which means LTE data will work on any carrier — Verizon, T-Mobile, AT&T, and so on. And like earlier Moto X phones, it’s customizable. For US buyers who aren't fans of Motorola's custom software, there's also a stock Android version that’s been dubbed the ""Moto X Pure Edition."" The Moto X Play is a smaller, cheaper version of the flagship Style — almost a competitor to the low-cost Moto G. It’s 5.5 inches instead of 5.7, and one of its big selling points is a massive battery; Motorola claims it will last two days at a time and can get 8 hours of power from a 15-minute charge. The rest of its specs and design are a bit less impressive than the Style’s, and it doesn’t include universal LTE support. A few years ago, Motorola’s Droid Razr Maxx phones were known for having the best batteries on the market. The Play follows in this tradition, but without the Razr’s notoriously clunky design and terrible software. Unfortunately, it's apparently just coming out across Europe, Latin America, and Canada for now, with no US release planned. Motorola’s recent phones have been pitched with the idea that specs are getting less and less important — even a low-end phone can be perfectly usable. With that in mind, it announced a third generation of its low-cost Moto G this morning. The Moto G is notably less powerful than either the Play or the Style, and it’s got the same 5-inch screen as its predecessor. Unlike earlier generations, though, it supports LTE networks. It’s also got the same sort of intricate customization options as the Moto X, instead of just offering a handful of colorful, swappable backplates. And it’s the first of Motorola’s new phones to see release — you can buy it starting today. Cameras have historically been one of the biggest problems with Android phones — at best, they’ve got one or two major drawbacks, and at worst, they’re a complete mess. Motorola is promising to fix this on all its phones. The Moto X Style and Play both come with 5-megapixel front cameras, and they’ve got 21-megapixel rear cameras that have supposedly been rated highly by independent reviewers. The Style can also record 4K video, while the Play can handle a more quotidian 1080p resolution. The Moto G, meanwhile, gets the less ambitious label of ""best in class"" for a low-cost phone, with a 13-megapixel rear camera. By normal smartphone standards, Motorola’s phones range from ""cheap"" to ""incredibly cheap."" The Moto X Style will be released worldwide in September with a price that’s ""$200 to $300"" lower than other flagship phones — the stock Android edition costs $399 in the US, compared to $650 for the iPhone 6. The Moto X Play isn't available in the US, but it's coming to Canada, Europe, and Latin America in August for ""$300 or $400 less"" than a standard flagship phone. And the Moto G (which is out today) costs as much as its predecessors, starting at $179.99. Correction: The first-generation Moto X came out in 2013, not 2010 as originally written, and the Moto X Play will be available in August.",0.5122960978450186,0.4877039021549814,0.2046624174393915,761,4.8646517739816035,388,6.054123711340206,0,28,"Mobile, Tech",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It looks a lot like last year's Moto X, but it comes with a bigger, higher resolution display and a new, 21-megapixel camera. It's going to be available this September for $399 unlocked. And this time around, it will work on any of the major carriers in the US. Motorola is making a big bet and some weird branding decisions with the Style. In the US, at least, the bet is that consumers will spring to buy it directly from Motorola, Amazon, or Best Buy. We confirmed here that it will not be available in any carrier stores. That's the bet, and at $399 unlocked it's a pretty solid deal for a flagship phone —  but we'll have to see where US consumers are finally ready to buy phones this way in large numbers. The weird branding decision: the Moto X Style is going to be called the Moto X Pure in the US. That's because market research has told Motorola that US consumers care a ton about ""pure"" Android — apparently more than they do about Style. But other than the difference in radio bands between the US and the rest of the world, Motorola says they're the exact same phone. Motorola's biggest claims for the Moto X Style are about the 21-megapixel camera. We've only had the briefest of moments to play with it and our first impressions is that it is fast. Very fast. Lighting is hit and miss here, of course, so we need more time to really say what we think of it. Motorola has set up an entire photography station here at its event, and we'll be sitting through the long line of reporters to check it out very soon. The phone has a 5.7-inch screen but feels remarkably smaller that it ought, thanks to the very thin bezels on the left and right. The screen is pushed about as far to the edge of the phone as it can be, minimizing the overall footprint of the phone itself. I'm still not convinced that I could use this phone comfortably in day to day use — my time with the similarly-sized Nexus 6 was fraught with drops and fumbles — but if you can live with a 5.5-inch phone, you can likely live with the 5.7-inch Moto X. Aside from size, the display is bright with great viewing angles and it's impossible to see any visible pixels. We won't know until we've got a review unit in hand if it has some of the odd color casting that plagued Motorola's earlier models, but initial impressions are quite good. Performance also seems to be really good — the new X is snappy and responsive. That's likely helped by the near stock version of Android 5.1 that it is equipped with, which Motorola is once again using as a selling point. There are a few customized apps included, but they are largely limited to Motorola's camera app, Assist, Connect, and a handful of other basic services. It's still the most pure version of Android you can get this side of a Nexus. There's not too much more to say about the Moto X Style at this point — the optional wood and leather finishes feel just as great as last year, and it's still a very well-built device. The Style has the signature curve that Motorola puts on all of its phones to make them more comfortable to hold, and it has a nice dimple on the backside to rest your index finger when holding the phone in one hand. Perhaps the most important story is the price — at $399, Motorola is aggressively undercutting the competition and even beating some of the other players in the low-cost flagship smartphone space. It's within spitting distance of the just-announced OnePlus 2, and less than the recently announced ZTE Axon. That's sure to be an appealing offer for those that want to buy their phones unlocked and without a commitment, but it remains to be seen whether or not this is aggressive enough to get the rest of the smartphone buying population on board with unlocked devices. Motorola won't be selling the Moto X Style until September, but we'll be sure to put it through its paces when it's available to see if it does indeed live up to Motorola's lofty claims.

Though LEDs of other colors have been around since the mid 1900s, the blue LED proved far more difficult to create as researchers struggled to find a material that would produce blue light. The three researchers being awarded today, Isamu Akasaki, Hiroshi Amano, and Shuji Nakamura, recognized that gallium nitride would lead to a blue color and discovered a way to produce the light in an efficient way by adding in aluminum and indium. Red, green, and blue light needs to be combined to create white light, so the work of Akasaki, Amano, and Nakamura provided the final piece to a long-running puzzle. Since then, white LED lights have increased in efficiency and are slowly becoming more prevalent.

And according to the researchers, these findings help explain why some coffee lovers bounce off the walls after a single cup, whereas others feel the need to invent alarm clocks that wake you up with a shot of espresso. Yet what's most interesting about this study isn't the individual variants that modulate our response to coffee, it's the fact that it confirms what coffee drinkers have known all along: the genetics of coffee drinking really just comes down to caffeine. the genetics of coffee drinking really just comes down to caffeine ""Researchers and much of the general public can relate to individual differences in taste preferences as well as the effects they feel when consuming coffee and how these factors influence the amount of coffee they drink,"" says Marilyn Cornelis, a geneticist at Harvard University and a co-author of the study published today in Molecular Psychiatry. But pinpointing specific genetic variants — areas of the genetic code that vary from person to person — wasn’t always possible, she says, so it was hard to tell whether caffeine was the most important factor in coffee drinking behaviors. Now that scientists can decipher the genetic components of behaviors, however, we’re that much closer to figuring out why coffee affects us the way it does. In the study, Cornelis and her team examined 2.5 million genetic variants from over 120,000 women and men, which they then linked to the participants' coffee drinking habits. This analysis helped them establish the central role of caffeine, as the variants they found were almost all related to the stimulant. For instance, two genes called POR and ABCG2 were found to play a role in caffeine metabolism, whereas another two appear to influence the rewarding effect of caffeine. The findings weren’t universal however, because coffee consumption is far from uniform.  Europeans, Americans and Australians for example, exhibited similar genetic patterns, but when the researchers examined a population living in Pakistan, they were unable to replicate their findings. ""Only 3 percent [of our sample in Pakistan] reported consuming any coffee,"" Cornelis says, so it's hard to link behaviors to specific variants. ""I would expect to see the same challenges for other non-coffee consuming nations."" The future might hold individualized caffeine consumption guidelines This study probably won’t change current coffee consumption habits, but that doesn’t mean it isn’t worthwhile. Eventually, Cornelis says, these results will help doctors and nutritionists create individualized caffeine guidelines — ones that are optimal for human health. ""Our results will enable us to study the health effects of coffee better, by taking into consideration these genetic factors,"" she says. And given the confusion that continues to surround coffee (coffee drinking is widely considered a ""bad habit,"" even though it’s been linked to decreased rates of Type 2 diabetes, prostate cancer, and oral cancer), that’s bound to be a good thing.",0.3756481817906349,0.624351818209365,0.3691729346723925,509,5.4106090373280944,309,6.1488673139158578,0,0,Science,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

And it originated in Canada, so it's unsurprising that North America controls its use.   And now that Ebola has ""reached"" the US, American privilege — white  privilege, especially — is floating to the surface, in even less subtle  ways.  From Vox.com: Living in a country ravaged by Ebola. The difference in treatment for US patients and African patients is stark, beyond the use of experimental drugs. Some Ebola-stricken regions in West Africa don’t have access to fuel to power ambulances, and many health workers lack the protective gear to stave off infection. Which is why it's so strange that Duncan's health has been used as an excuse to voice concerns about the presence of foreigners in Dallas. Instead of asking government officials why the WHO has a much smaller budget than the CDC or why it has suffered massive cuts in the last two years, Americans have preferred to focus on themselves. Duncan’s health is an excuse to voice concerns about foreigners Yesterday, The Raw Story wrote about how immigrants living in the same neighborhood as Duncan’s family were facing immense discrimination. Some have been turned away from their jobs, David Edwards writes, while others have been refused service in restaurants. The color of their skin and their accents makes them a target, even though they never came into contact with Duncan, and therefore pose zero risk. It doesn’t matter: they’re dark-skinned and foreign. They’re in Dallas. They might be infectious. Now, an ugly new hashtag has emerged: #Obola, a coinage that was popularized thanks to a tweet by conservative writer Dinesh D’Souza, and a Michael Savage radio segment. If you don’t get the reference, I don’t blame you. The President’s name doesn't exactly resemble ""Ebola."" But D’Souza, a known ""birther,"" has somehow managed to liken a name like Obama with a disease that’s raging in Africa — not in the US. Predictably, this has given racist xenophobic Americans a banner to rally around.  #Obola is a terrorist. He allowed a volatile virus into the Republic & encourages illegals w/disease 2 enter. #ISIS @ChipGates1 @Philscbx WE'RE FUCKED thanks to you politically correct IDIOTS and you PATHETIC crackers with white guilt! #Obola #Ebola #CNN pic.twitter.com/5zAoZwZ7Nh  Why don't we quarantine anybody from Ebola-stricken countries who wants to enter US at GITMO for 25 days? #Obola America: your xenophobia is showing. Many have lost sight that the only way to become infected with Ebola is by coming into contact with the bodily fluids of someone who’s showing symptoms. Others have ignored the fact that, so far, no one who came into contact with Duncan has developed symptoms of Ebola. Instead, there are calls for larger quarantines in Dallas — or a continent-wide one in Africa — which would only lead to more infections, and a greater sense of panic. Xenophobic rhetoric has dehumanized individuals dealing with a terrible disease Ebola is scary because it causes quick, gruesome deaths. But it isn’t easy to transmit. Had we acted sooner, had we prevented the WHO’s budget from being cut, we probably wouldn’t be dealing with such large numbers of infected people now. It’s not like we don’t know how to stop Ebola — we’ve done it in the past. That’s what we should be talking about. We should be asking why the first case of Ebola transmission outside Africa happened in Spain, a country that recently experienced public health cuts. We’re playing catch-up, and the CDC is optimistic. But when people spend more energy on dehumanizing individuals in Dallas than on urging politicians to help the people of Liberia and Sierra Leone, we all lose out.",0.46497274265570393,0.535027257344296,0.8417726718184194,799,5.0275344180225279,455,6.2241758241758243,1,0,"Science, US & World, Essay",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The three scientists will share a reward of 8 million Swedish kronor ($1.1 million). Betzig and Moerner are US citizens, and Dr. Hell is a German citizen. For years, scientists believed that the resolution of optical microscopy was limited to half a wavelength of light, or 0.2 micrometers. But Hell passed that limit in 2000, when he developed stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy — a method that uses two laser beams to return images of higher resolution than the perceived limit. Betzig and Moerner each developed a second method called single-molecule microscopy, which Betzig demonstrated for the first time in 2006. This method relies on controlling the fluorescence of individual molecules and superimposing images to yield a ""dense super-image"" at the nano level. Today, nanoscopy is used to track the movements of individual molecules inside cells, and has opened new doors in the study of Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, and Huntington's diseases. It has also been used to study synapses in the brain and to track proteins in fertilized eggs.

For no apparent reason, the comedian and actor started musing about Mars and the origins of life on Earth. Check out some of the tweets below: It really feels like Mars used to be a here that got globally warmed by some very us-y people-things.   What was left turned into here and our moon and got seeded by marsian corpse DNA. And later we'll use our moon to go back. In case you didn't quite catch that, C.K. suggests that ""us-y people-things"" once lived on Mars, but that they died from global warming... on Mars. He also posits that DNA from Martians reached Earth and ""populated"" our planet. And even though he was probably just gunning for some laughs, the amazing thing about this theory is this: He might not be completely wrong. Let's examine the facts, shall we? Mars' average temperature is minus 80 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 60 Celsius), which means it's actually much colder than Earth. This makes a lot of sense since Mars is located farther away from the Sun. Still, global warming isn't about a planet being hot — temperature is all relative anyways — it's about a planet getting progressively and significantly warmer over time. So was Mars once a lot colder? Unfortunately that's really hard to tell. We have very little information about Mars prior to the 1970s. What scientists do know is that Mars isn't experiencing any form of warming right now, despite what some climate skeptics might tell you (that argument has been used to ""demonstrate"" that climate change isn't caused by humans). Instead, the regional temperature changes that do occur are a product of Mars' very thin atmosphere — which makes the planet more susceptible to temperature changes — and its extremely large oval-shaped orbit, which causes it to experience larger fluctuations in temperature as it approaches and then moves away from the Sun. Moreover, depending on their severity, Mars' many dust storms also tend to cause the planet's temperature to fluctuate from year to year. Given that lack of historical data on Mars' climate, however, I'm calling this a tie. This is the first part that C.K. might be right about. There exists evidence that water was once present on Mars. This fulfills a pretty crucial part of the life-supporting equation, because unless you're a tardigrade or a rotifer, surviving without water is rarely possible. Yet, water on its own isn't enough evidence for life on Mars. You also need something like a fossil to prove that bit. Enter NASA geologist David McKay. In 1996, his team of researchers found complex organic molecules and what appeared to be fossilized microbes in a Martian meteorite that had landed on Earth. This, the researchers said, might be a sign that Mars once harbored life. That whole idea is still up for debate (it's highly contested, actually), however, and current scientific consensus says that we don't have enough evidence for life on Mars. That might change, of course, especially since one of the main objectives of the NASA Curiosity rover is to find signs of ancient life on the Martian surface. So right now C.K. isn't completely wrong. He just isn't right. Because McKay's meteorite was found on Earth, some researchers have suggested that life on Earth may have originated on Mars (or vice versa). And more recently, a biochemist named Steven Benner pointed out that an element named molybdenum wasn't present in its life-constructing, oxidized form when life first appeared on Earth. It was present on Mars, however. ""It's only when molybdenum becomes highly oxidized that it is able to influence how early life formed,"" he said in a statement at the time. ""This form of molybdenum couldn't have been available on Earth at the time life first began, because 3 billion years ago, the surface of the Earth had very little oxygen, but Mars did."" Thus, it's possible that life on Earth originated on Mars, which means that C.K.'s claims kind of make sense if you look at them in a certain light. Unfortunately, there isn't enough evidence at this time. What little evidence we have of life on Mars comes from organic molecules and what might be interpreted as fossilized microbes. The idea that a humanoid form would have evolved on Mars, and then somehow devolved prior to making it to Earth isn't supported by any respected source. Sorry, C.K. The tweets that followed are by far the kookiest, but from what I can tell, C.K. suggests our solar system is a space ship, and once our planets align just right, we will get some sort of powerboost from the Sun. This, he says, will send us to a ""bigger"" and far away place that I'm guessing is better than our current location.  And it feels like we are gonna keep bopping around on moons til we realize the whole solar system is actually a spaceship.  The sun is the engine and if you wait til it all lines up just right and you push ""go"" you can ride it to a bigger far place.  I would really like to emphasize that these are not opinions or theories. It's just a feeling I have. It probably goes without saying, but there's no scientific evidence to support C.K.'s feelings. I therefore urge you all to enjoy the jokes, and walk away.    I'm not high.   Update 5:36PM: A planetary scientist at NASA, Paul Niles, emailed us with more information. As it turns out, what's perhaps most incoherent about C.K.'s tweets is that ""global warming in the Mars case would have made it MORE habitable rather than less habitable."" He also pointed out that given that water once flowed on Mars' surface, it's likely that Mars was much warmer in the past. C.K's whole global warming ""feeling"" isn't looking too good right now.

The company emerged back in 2009 with a novel app that let people “check in” to a location. That vision, and the local information that followed, propelled it to amass tens of millions of users, hundreds of millions in funding, and billions upon billions of data points from people who used Foursquare to check in around the globe. The problem was, in 2014, that story no longer worked for Foursquare. In fact, it was holding the company back.   “Listen, the point of the company, this whole thing, was never to build an awesome check-in button,” says Crowley. “That’s not the thing we got out of bed and said, that we wanted to build the most awesome check-in button in the world!” Back in 2009 declaring your location was a necessity, because phones didn’t have the power to reliably pinpoint a user, and Foursquare didn’t have much data on what venues were nearby. By 2014, however, both the technology and the data have finally come of age.   With the check-in front and center, however, Foursquare was still struggling to enter the mainstream and saw its user growth overtaken by younger startups. The company had created a new paradigm around location sharing, but that activity was never going to be as popular as snapping a selfie, sharing a link, or firing off a tweet.   So Crowley decided it was time to do something radical. “What if we don't need people to check in anymore?,” he asked. “What does a version of Foursquare look like that doesn't beg you to check in as soon as you open it up?” Over the last six months, the team has been hard at work on a complete reinvention of the company. In the end they decided that, in order to save Foursquare, they would have to break it half, splitting the iconic service into two separate apps.   Today, the company is announcing the first fruit of this labor, a brand new app called Swarm that will exist alongside the current Foursquare app. Swarm will be a social heat map, helping users find friends nearby and check in to share their location. A completely rewritten Foursquare app will launch in a month or so. The new Foursquare will ditch the check-in and focus solely on exploration and discovery, finally positioning itself as a true Yelp-killer in the battle to provide great local search.  The next era of Foursquare began in a room aptly nicknamed ""Don’t Stop Believing."" Crowley gathered his top brass. They had spent the last couple years shaping and reshaping the mobile app, moving buttons around, and changing language, but it was time for a bigger transformation. Starting in November of 2013, Crowley instructed them to break the app down into its basic parts, little Lego blocks that represented everything it could do. Then they would rebuild Foursquare from scratch. One block was Pilgrim, the company’s cutting-edge tech for guessing a user’s location. Another was the 60 million venues and points of interest the company gathered across the world in one of the largest databases of its kind. The team came up with dozens of different ideas for what the service should look like in 2014, but every answer had one thing in common: they all said Foursquare needed to grow out of its one-app approach. Foursquare's new direction wasn't based on gut instinct. It relied on some pretty scary data the company gathered about how people had been using its app — or how they hadn't been using it. ""We looked at the session analysis and saw that only 1 in 20 sessions had both social and discovery,"" says Noah Weiss, Foursquare’s vice president of product management. In other words, just 5 percent of Foursquare’s users were opening it to find friends and find a restaurant. ""Why not actually just split those apart, because 19 out of 20 times, tapping on one icon or the other, you have satisfied your need completely,"" says Weiss. ""The more we played with that idea the more we realized that there was a ton we wanted to do on both sides that we can’t do if they are married together,"" says Jon Steinback, Foursquare’s VP of product experience. ""It’s like we were in a three legged race and each side was slowing the other side down."" Weiss is a bit more cynical. ""We had been taking on a little bit of a mission impossible,"" he says, ""trying to make a single-purpose mobile app that actually had two purposes."" Foursquare’s decision can be seen as part of a larger trend in the mobile space to unbundle complex web properties into a suite of connected apps, rather than trying to jam numerous features into a single package. Foursquare’s new divide might actually make even more sense than the unbundling strategies Facebook, Google, and Twitter have employed, since Foursquare’s two sides seemed to be holding each other back. ""I think mobile forced this fundamental switch. We were born in mobile but we were born in this idea that each mobile app was kind of like a web property bundled up for mobile,"" says Steinback. ""And as mobile usage has broadened and evolved you get individual experiences instead. You open an app to do a specific task and not as a gateway to a large complicated experience."" Having the check-in button as the main interface every time users opened the app created a noticeable hurdle for engagement. ""Imagine if you opened up YouTube and the first thing it asked you to do was create a video. That would scare off a lot of people,"" says Bijan Sabet, one of Foursquare’s early investors and a current board member. ""Just like you don’t need to tweet to enjoy Twitter, splitting the app in two will help make it clear to a big audience that you don’t need to check in to find value in Foursquare."" During months of testing, the company found that unbundling the two halves of Foursquare made each experience more focused and efficient. Sessions were shorter, but more frequent. And using some simple hooks in iOS and Android, Foursquare can shuttle users back and forth between the two apps with ease, much as Facebook does with its main app and its Messenger app. ""By simplifying a lot of the story, and having an app that's dedicated to search and discovery I think it's going to be very clear to people that the search and discovery tools that we built are some of the best in class,"" says Crowley. Swarm should work very well for seeing who’s around to get one more drink at 1 AM, but Foursquare may have been beaten to the punch by an old rival: Facebook. Two weeks before Foursquare announced its big split, Facebook debuted ""Nearby Friends,"" a feature two years in the making which, for better or worse, looks and acts a whole lot like Foursquare’s Swarm. Crowley posted on Tumblr the following day that he’s not concerned, for the same reason he wasn’t concerned when Facebook first tried check-ins back in 2010. Your Facebook friend list is far too big for people to be comfortable sharing intimate data like their location, Crowley says. Passive location-sharing in a way that people actually wantA number of similar apps like Highlight, Sonar, and Banjo, which helped you track down friends and interesting strangers, were so broad that they bombed with the mainstream.  Both Nearby and Swarm try to ease user’s concerns by providing a sense of which friends are close by without giving away too much detail. ""[We’re] using passive location-sharing in a way that people actually want,"" says Weiss. ""They don’t want to be precision-pointed [latitude and longitude] on a map so somebody can go find them in the middle of a park. What they want is for friends to be ambiently aware of where they are, so when they got out of the train in Williamsburg, they can say, ‘Who are my 10 friends in Williamsburg?’"" Most importantly, while you can check in with Swarm, it also passively notes your general location even if you don’t open the app. So if you come out of a subway station and look at your phone, Foursquare will understand that you’re in a new neighborhood and update your status accordingly. This might still seem creepy for some people, but in that sense Foursquare may have one big advantage over Facebook when it comes to ambient location sharing. People who download Swarm are making an explicit decision to provide this kind of data to a specific set of friends. Swarm is the big story today, but it’s really the changes that will occur within the classic Foursquare app that could grow the company in a massive way. It's a distinction signified by the apps’ internal nicknames: Batman for Foursquare, Robin for Swarm. It’s a tacit acknowledgement by Foursquare that checking in may never appeal to more than a niche audience. Local search, however, is a mainstream activity that anyone with a smartphone is going to want. ""The thinking is, if we start to remove a lot of the friction, we make the tools much more accessible to people, that’s the path by which you get from where we are now to 75, 100 million, more than 100 million users,"" says Crowley. Back in 2012, Foursquare struggled to raise new funding at an attractive valuation. First it took on debt, then raised fresh capital, but at a lower valuation than its earlier rounds. The company’s net worth, in other words, was shrinking, and one of its two co-founders, Naveen Selvadurai, departed. The core issue was that its user growth had slowed considerably and fallen behind its peers in the world of mobile social networks. But if these changes help Foursquare finally hit those bigger user numbers, its investors believe it will be extremely valuable. The company has been inserting ads into its app for a little over two years now, and that taught it some critical details. ""We’ve learned a lot,"" says Ben Horowitz, one of the company’s investors and board members. ""And the results have been quite good in that Foursquare already monetizes better than almost any social experience."" When it comes to advertising, Foursquare can make far more per user than public companies like Facebook or Twitter. ""That is a powerful fact going forward and helps them keep a focus ... they know they can build an extremely valuable company without having anything like a billion users."" The company’s head of revenue, Steven Rosenblatt, knows better than most about earnings potential. His previous job was at Apple, one of the most profitable companies on the planet, where he helped launch its mobile ad product. He was inspired to leave for Foursquare, he says, because he thought it was simply the best way to do mobile advertising. ""Everybody else is using geo-fencing, which is nice, but gets things wrong about two thirds of the time,"" he says. ""We have location accuracy that is better than anything I’ve seen during my 16 years in this business, and that’s why advertisers are willing to pay."" Sources familiar with the situation say Foursquare has grown its revenue from around $2 million in 2012 to $12 million in 2013, and is on pace to make between $40 to $50 million this year. The best model for where the company hopes to be a few years from now is probably Yelp, and in fact people around the Foursquare office refer to its new discovery app as a ""Yelp-killer"". Built on its user-generated reviews of local shops and restaurants, Yelp is now a public company valued at $4.6 billion. Foursquare thinks it has the data and technology to beat Yelp, but people just haven’t realized it because they were scared off by the check-ins, badges, and social features that Foursquare originally pitched. ""If we all went to Google right now, or went to Yelp right now, we'd all get the same results, and that seems really really broken to me,"" says Crowley. ""Foursquare should understand the neighborhoods I've spent a lot of time in, and the restaurants that I went to once but never went back to."" In that sense Foursquare hopes to provide not just the best local search, but the kind of predictive intelligence that comes with a digital assistant like Microsoft’s Cortana, Apple’s Siri, or Google Now. In Crowley’s future, your phone doesn’t just tell you what’s nearby — it tells you what you’ll enjoy based on everywhere you (and your friends) have ever been. But how can Foursquare personalize its users' results if they are no longer collecting check-ins, the foundation of Foursquare’s recommendation engine? Crowley smiles and says something a bit shocking. He no longer needs check-ins, the meat and potatoes of Foursquare’s entire business and data collection engine for the last five years. Not only has Foursquare collected 6 billion check-ins, he says, but it has collected 6 billion signals to help it map out over 60 million places around the world. Each place is a shape that looks like a hot zone of check-ins — of times when people have said ""I’m here."" Foursquare’s ""Pilgrim"" location-guessing engine factors in everything from your GPS signal, to cell tower triangulation, to the number of bars you have, to the Wi-Fi networks nearby, in order to create these virtual shapes. Now that it has this data, Foursquare can make a very accurate guess at where you are when you stop moving, even without a check-in, a technology it hopes will allow it to keep its database of places fresh and accurate. Foursquare calls these implicit check-ins ""p-check-ins,"" or Neighborhood Sharing. Take your phone into four or five different Japanese restaurants over the course of six months and without a single check-in Foursquare will learn that you like Japanese food and start making recommendations for you based on that data. ""This ability to be contextually aware, to have a general sense of the things that I like based upon where the device has been, and the things that I might like based upon where I’ve been in the past or where my friends have been, that’s a really magical ability."" argues Crowley. Tiny micro-facts are part of what could make Foursquare bigger than a recommendations service. ""We don’t want you to read longform reviews. We don’t even have longform reviews. What we do have is many millions of people telling us tens of millions of times what is this place known for? What is the vibe of this place?"" says Weiss. ""How can we surface that back to you in a really authoritative way so you can scan that at a glance?"" In this way Crowley and his team don’t really think of Foursquare as a Yelp competitor. They think of it as something much bigger — a means to finding interesting things around you anywhere in the world. Crowley has for years promised a service that buzzed you when something cool is nearby, and he might finally be in a position to offer it. ""We think of Foursquare as a technology that’s enabling these superpowers… to see around corners and through walls, it’s like I want to find the best stuff that exists within you know, 100 yards, 5 miles, 10 miles of me,"" says Crowley. ""I walked into a restaurant and it told me what to order. I walked into a neighborhood and it told me three places to go to. My plane landed in a city I’ve never been to and it’s telling me that two friends are nearby. That’s stuff that we’re doing now, and I think what people will get is that it’s very clearly the future.""

Since its former employee John Carmack helped improve the Oculus Rift VR headset, warned ZeniMax Media, Oculus would have to pay. Initially, Oculus laughed off the threat, characterizing it as a cash grab timed to intercept the $2 billion Facebook deal. But it turns out that ZeniMax has more than threats: it has Oculus founder Palmer Luckey's signature on a piece of paper. The document in question is an agreement that gave Oculus the ability to use a ""VR testbed"" provided by ZeniMax. We have since removed it from this article at the request of our source. The paper by itself, signed before Oculus even became a company, may not mean very much. For the most part, it looks like a standard non-disclosure agreement, the kind that people routinely sign whenever companies give one another permission to look at — but not obtain any rights to — another company's intellectual property. It could be as simple as ""Palmer Luckey, you have permission to show the Oculus Rift running Doom, but you agree that Doom still belongs to us."" ZeniMax sees this as a smoking gun But The Verge understands that ZeniMax takes this document to mean a whole lot more. They believe that anything John Carmack contributed to the Oculus Rift is now their property as a result. That may not just include code, but any other suggestions Carmack made as a consultant for Oculus while on the ZeniMax payroll. It could potentially mean that his role promoting the Oculus Rift could also be included. For instance, we understand that some of the original investors in Oculus were introduced to Palmer Luckey's project via John Carmack. It also sounds like Carmack wasn't working alone: that ZeniMax had an entire team on the project, several members of whom also joined Oculus VR when all was said and done. All in all, the argument is that the Oculus Rift went from a janky prototype to being shown at the world's most important video game conference in the blink of an eye, thanks to the work that ZeniMax employees did under Carmack's watch, and that could be true. But we don't know if that would stand up in court, and without knowing what Palmer Luckey agreed to when he signed this document, and what John Carmack and his fellow id Software employees agreed to when they left id Software, it's hard to predict anything for sure. Oculus declined to comment for this story. There is one popular argument that ZeniMax may not be able to make, though: John Carmack says that the current Oculus Rift uses no code that he wrote while on the Zenimax payroll. Oculus uses zero lines of code that I wrote while under contract to Zenimax.

Everyone from Ayn Rand to Karl Marx will give you a slightly different answer, but the majority of solutions boil down to some combination of cost, competition, popularity, and good old trial and error. That basic formula hasn’t changed for centuries. The modern rise of supersized, sell-everything stores has, however, fundamentally altered the method of calculation. With over 200 different varieties of canned tomatoes on Walmart shelves, the complexity of putting a sticker on any one of them has exploded. To take the guessing out of this process, big store chains are now turning to data. Data of the scale and breadth to match their football-pitch-sized supermarkets. Big data.  This past week I visited the offices of Dunnhumby, a company that started off as a charming husband-and-wife operation in 1989 and has since grown into one of the biggest customer analytics firms in the world. It specializes in collecting and making sense of the masses of information supermarkets collect on a daily basis — both about their own operations and their customers’ particular shopping habits. ""It’s all about ensuring logic at the shelf,"" says VP Sean Dangler as he walks me through a demo of the KSS Retail PriceStrat software. KSS Retail is a subsidiary of Dunnhumby, which is itself owned by Tesco, the UK’s dominant supermarket chain and the world’s second-largest retailer after Walmart. Tesco recently deployed PriceStrat across its UK stores, meaning that the system I was looking at was the very same that sets the price of a loaf of tiger bread.  16 million loyalty cards can tell you a lot about the way people think Dangler takes me down the virtual yogurt aisle to demonstrate his concept of shelf logic. We see no fewer than 517 varieties to choose from. He needs to set a price for each one that coheres with every variant nearby and makes sense to the browsing shopper. It’s not enough to simply know that a 12-pack should cost less per item than a six-pack, nor that branded yogurts should command a price premium. This system is aware enough to tell its user by exactly how much each of those prices should vary. Dynamically and in real time. The key to all of this is your store loyalty card. Dunnhumby got its big breakthrough with the introduction of the Tesco Clubcard as the UK’s first customer loyalty card in 1995. Today, it continues to manage all the incoming data from the roughly 16 million Clubcard members and it’s that additional insight that the PriceStrat software taps into. Knowing customers’ names, addresses, family situation, and shopping habits, it can detect such nuanced things as your yogurt flavor preferences and internal hierarchy of brands. It’s capable of identifying the precise price point at which you would switch between brands or how much incentive you’d need to buy the bigger pack. It’s this extra layer of personalized data, which is combined with two years’ worth of checkout receipts, that makes PriceStrat formidably knowledgeable. Even if you’ve never stepped foot in a Tesco store before, your shopping habits are now predictable to the big supermarket chain, which can synthesize a model of your preferences by referring to demographically similar shoppers. Anonymous data is good, but it only provides an average. The customer-specific tracking that comes from the use of loyalty cards is exponentially more valuable in adding social and economic dimensions to what stores know about their customers. It also sets the stage for PriceStrat’s next big trick: forecasting sales as prices change. PriceStrat can simulate the impact of any pricing change to a 95-percent certainty.  Once Dangler has set up his basic pricing rules, he’s ready to start testing out potential discounts and special offers to try and improve sales. He goes for an aggressive price cut on the own-brand natural yogurt, cutting the profit margin to a few pennies, and the volume of predicted sales balloons as a result. It turns out that people are really price-sensitive when buying cold desserts. Alas, a large proportion of the gains is offset by a drop in branded sales, meaning the idea would probably result in worsening relationships with suppliers in exchange for a modest increase in profits. We keep searching for the optimal solution, with every small change having an immediate trickle-down effect on related products. It’s like a chaos theory testing suite, with each price being a flap of a butterfly’s wings. The only thing missing is a button to make the system automatically optimize everything, you still need humans to input scenarios. It’s like a chaos theory testing suite, with each price being a flap of a butterfly’s wings Along the way, I discover phenomena like asymmetric cross-price elasticity — an eight-pack’s price affects sales of four-packs more strongly than vice versa — and the fact that a ""buy one, get one free"" offer is more cost efficient than a straight 50 percent price cut (that’s because some people will still take just one). Melding such insights with seasonal trends and household-specific behavior tracking can lead to incredibly accurate predictions of the price a supermarket needs to set to get its next shopper to buy yogurt. Dangler tells me that the PriceStrat sales estimates are consistently within 5 percent of the actual numbers — no matter what weird and multilayered scenario you throw at the system. I notice that almost none of this sophistication addresses the classic considerations of cost and competition, and Dangler tells me that’s quite intentional. Companies like his are trying to invert the traditional structure of looking at per-item profit margins and competitors’ prices first, choosing to take customer preferences as their starting point. His software includes price comparisons and direct costs, but only as pieces in the greater puzzle of organizing a vast array of goods and products in an economically optimal way. The amount of information we produce, not just consume, was the subject of a recent blog post by new Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, who believes we’re on the brink of an era of ""ambient intelligence."" With the use of digital devices becoming ubiquitous and generating an ever-expanding ""data exhaust"" from each individual, Nadella thinks that the future of computing lies in correctly interpreting and learning from that mass of information. IBM, which offers a similar 360-degree customer analytics platform to PriceStrat, reported in 2011 that 90 percent of the world’s data had been produced in the previous two years. Though Nadella and guys like those I met at Dunnhumby are universally optimistic about this trend, it does create an obvious privacy concern. ""What scares me,"" remarked Lord MacLaurin, Tesco’s boss at the time of the launch of the Clubcard, ""is that you know more about my customers after three months than I know after 30 years."" ""What scares me is that you know more about my customers after three months than I know after 30 years."" In an act that is simultaneously democratizing and disquieting, supermarkets are starting to place the customer at the center of their pricing strategies. They know more about who we are, what we like to buy, and how we tend to buy it than ever before, and they’re reaching out for even more. Tesco has successfully rolled out its Hudl Android tablet and a Clubcard TV online service as a pair of extra incentives to encourage its users to volunteer more of their information. In many ways, it’s just an effort to keep pace with data-driven online companies like Amazon and Google, whose profitability relies on knowing as much about their users as possible. My experience with the PriceStrat software has been a study in better profitability through science: it’s a mathematical system that accounts for a wide spectrum of consequences, but takes no regard of ethical or socioeconomic considerations. Nonetheless, the actual functioning of the software, the vast databases it can harness, and the oftentimes counterintuitive insights it can produce are undeniably impressive. It might never be smart enough to determine the fair price of a milkshake, but it can certainly figure out the most profitable one.",0.6376585098402414,0.3623414901597586,0.19453804756431323,1370,5.123357664233577,711,6.556962025316456,0,0,"Business, Tech, Report",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

Now, it may come back to bite Oculus and Facebook in the ass. Now that John Carmack works for Oculus, his former employer ZeniMax Media claims that it owns part of the intellectual property in the headset, and may sue Facebook and Oculus over those ideas in the near future. The Wall Street Journal obtained two letters from ZeniMax lawyers sent to Oculus and Facebook, which claim that Carmack's contributions were invaluable to the initial success of the Rift: ""It was only through the concerted efforts of Mr. Carmack, using technology developed over many years at, and owned by, ZeniMax, that [Oculus founder Palmer] Luckey was able to transform his garage-based pipe dream into a working reality,"" the letter reportedly reads. ""ZeniMax provided necessary VR technology and other valuable assistance to Palmer Luckey and other Oculus employees"" ""ZeniMax provided necessary VR technology and other valuable assistance to Palmer Luckey and other Oculus employees in 2012 and 2013 to make the Oculus Rift a viable VR product, superior to other VR market offerings,"" said ZeniMax in a statement to The Verge. ""The proprietary technology and know-how Mr. Carmack developed when he was a ZeniMax employee, and used by Oculus, are owned by ZeniMax."" ZeniMax claims, and The Verge has confirmed, that Luckey signed a non-disclosure and non-ownership agreement in 2012 that covered some form of VR technology, though it's not clear what it included. The company also says that Oculus was aware of the issue well before the Facebook buyout. ZeniMax and Oculus ""previously attempted to reach an agreement whereby ZeniMax would be compensated for its intellectual property through equity ownership in Oculus but were unable to reach a satisfactory resolution,"" says a spokesperson. In a statement to The Verge, Oculus ridiculed the idea. ""It's unfortunate, but when there's this type of transaction, people come out of the woodwork with ridiculous and absurd claims. We intend to vigorously defend Oculus and its investors to the fullest extent,"" wrote a company representive. The original Oculus Rift prototype, as shown off by John Carmack However, Oculus could be more vulnerable than you'd think to such threats. The Oculus Rift is unusual in the consumer technology space in that Oculus owns very little intellectual property on the physical hardware, in part because its key ingredients were openly developed at a research lab where Oculus founder Palmer Luckey was an intern. That's not to say that ZeniMax necessarily owns Carmack's work on virtual reality, which he openly discussed on the web, but Oculus may not be able to defend itself simply by pulling out a stack of patents. And, at least according to the Journal's anonymous sources, ZeniMax isn't a Johnny-come-lately that's only asking for money now that Facebook dropped $2 billion for the virtual reality company. The Journal reports that Zenimax became interested back in August 2012, back when the Oculus Rift Kickstarter campaign began. That seems odd, though, particularly given comments made at the time Carmack and ZeniMax parted ways. Carmack said he actually left the studio he founded, id Sofware, because owner ZeniMax didn't want him working on virtual reality. Even if the claim turns out to be bunk, it could be interesting and costly if Oculus and new owner Facebook are forced to prove it in court. John Carmack says that his work at ZeniMax wasn't patented either, so ZeniMax may need to prove that Oculus is using its proprietary code and ideas in order to force a settlement or reach a favorable verdict. No work I have ever done has been patented. Zenimax owns the code that I wrote, but they don't own VR.

The new security measures come following the alleged rape of an Uber passenger by one of its drivers, which led to the service being banned under taxi regulations.

It also intends to implement some type of background screenings, though it does not say what those will be yet. The new measures appear, in part, to respond to criticisms that surfaced in a Fortune article discussing issues with police verification and forged documents in Delhi. Uber also intends to reverify all current drivers.  A lot of Uber's plans are vague for now In addition to better screening its drivers, Uber is also providing some new safety features for its riders. For one, Uber is slightly enhancing its ShareMyETA feature — which has been available for over a year now — to include a photo of the driver when a rider in India chooses to share their trip information with a friend. That's in addition to the information that feature currently shares, which includes a live-updating map of your location, your driver's first name, and your vehicle's plate number. Uber also says that it is introducing a local incident response team, though it did not provide details on when this would launch or how passengers would be able to reach it. These features are only being made available in India for now, though Uber suggests that they may eventually roll out globally. News also surfaced today about Delhi loosening restrictions on taxi upstarts, which some outlets believed would allow companies like Uber to move back into the city. Those changes appear to only impact taxi companies that use a radio dispatch, however, so it won't change the situation for Uber, which cannot operate until the Delhi High Court lifts its ban.

A report in Der Spiegel has shed new light on the NSA's encryption-breaking programs, and put a spotlight on the handful of programs that are still giving them trouble. The findings, based on leaked documents, were also presented onstage at the Chaos Computer Club Conference in Hamburg by researcher Jacob Appelbaum and Laura Poitras, who took the findings as a call to action. ""We really wanted to have some of these answers for 15 years,"" Appelbaum told the crowd. The reports describe ""major problems"" following users across the Tor network The most impressive news to come out of the dump is that, as of 2012, certain emails and chats were still indecipherable by the NSA database when they had been encrypted with the right tools. Reports describe ""major problems"" following users across the Tor network, or deciphering messages sent through heavily encrypted email providers like Zoho. The agency reported similar problems when deciphering files that had been encrypted with TrueCrypt, an open-source disk-encryption program that was discontinued earlier this year. PGP encryption tools and OTR chat encryption also caused major problems for the agency, causing entire messages to disappear from the system, leaving only the message: ""No decrypt available for this PGP encrypted message."" ""No decrypt available for this PGP encrypted message."" Not every service fared so well. Following a particular file across the web is marked as ""trivial,"" while decrypting emails sent through the Russian mail service ""Mail.ru"" is marked as ""moderate."" Virtual private networks also offer little protection: documents show the NSA planning the capacity to surveil 20,000 VPN connections per hour. Perhaps most alarming, the NSA seems to have completely circumvented the HTTPS system, which is used to secure connections between websites and browsers. By late 2012, the agency expected to be able to intercept 10 million HTTPS connections per day. This also doesn't mean PGP and Tor users are completely inaccessible. Law enforcement has performed successful attacks on Tor using a variety of tactics, and even the most impressive encryption tool can't get around a local malware infection. The age of the documents has also raised concerns: documents from 2012 show the NSA struggling to crack the AES encryption standard — one of the most widely used standards in cryptography — and some observers are worried that the NSA's efforts may have succeeded in the two years since. For security experts, the result is a mixed bag. Many of the cracked standards were already known to be faulty, so the news of widespread HTTPS circumvention is alarming, but not entirely surprising. At the same time, anyone depending on PG or Tor to throw off surveillance should be relieved to find evidence that the tools have often succeeded in doing just that. But for Appelbaum, the broader lesson was the ongoing fight between government surveillance and private communications. ""During the crypto wars, we thought that we had won.... We thought that with cryptography we could change the entire balance,"" Appelbaum said. ""We can say now that the first crypto wars were not won.

At least, that appeared to be the National Security Agency's thinking. Last night, the NSA released reports detailing all the times they've illegally spied on American citizens. Ho ho ho! the redactions make it hard to judge how often privacy violations happenThe heavily redacted documents were released in response to a lawsuit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union under the Freedom of Information Act. Many of these privacy violations have been previously reported on, but these documents show new specifics. A series of annual and quarterly reports from 2001 through the second quarter of 2013 are now available for perusal, and they cover some of the NSA's greatest hits: stalking potential romantic partners, a practice apparently so common it's been nicknamed LOVEINT; erroneously targeting US citizens for spying; database queries that returned queries on US citizens who weren't targeted; storage of data on servers ""not authorized"" to hold it; and access by people without security clearance to — well, to something; the specifics were redacted. In fact, the frequent redactions make it hard to judge how often these privacy violations are happening, though previous reports suggest they occur thousands of times a year. But don't worry, the NSA says. ""The problems uncovered were routine,"" according to NSA/CSS Office of the Inspector General report in the documents representing the first quarter of 2013. the reports do not exactly fill a citizen with confidence Between agents forwarding emails to ""unauthorized recipients"" with the identities of US citizens, the release of identities to ""unauthorized chatrooms,"" and the release of classified intelligence to someone not authorized to see it, the reports do not exactly fill a citizen — referred to as an USP, or ""US person"" in the reports — with confidence. The errors are bad enough, but agents have deliberately overstepped their legal bounds while spying on Americans. Congress has considered restrictions on the agency's authority, but hasn't acted to do anything about illegal spying on its citizens.

It appears that Rock Band 4, the first Rock Band game for this generation of consoles, will be released on October 6th, which is when Amazon lists the game as becoming available for both the Xbox One and PlayStation 4. It's worth noting that retailers are sometimes wrong about release dates, but the timeframe seems right — it'd put Rock Band in competition with the new Guitar Hero, which is targeted for this fall and will likely receive a proper release date soon.  Getting a full band is going to be pricey As usual, buying a full Rock Band kit is going to be pricey. Amazon has the full set-up — with a guitar, drum kit, and mic — available for $249.99. Toys R Us also lists a package that just includes the guitar at $129.99. If you have old instruments lying around, those should still work, and you can buy the game itself for, likely, $59.99. If you're not already set up with instruments, that means getting started with Rock Band is going to be more expensive than getting into the new Guitar Hero, which includes its guitar for $99. Of course, there are really big differences between the two games this generation. Rock Band 4 seems to be just another Rock Band, while Guitar Hero Live is going back to being a guitar-only game and brings with it a new key layout and a rethought formula of what the game should look like.

And from the sounds of it, developers are experimenting with what else is possible on Sony's VR platform. Adam Boyes, Sony's VP of publisher and developer relations, told Wired that game makers aren't limiting themselves to typical genres. In all, Sony is tracking development of 30 games for Morpheus. There are small puzzle games. Relaxation games. First-person exploration games. Networked games where you can play with other people.

He’s a trustworthy and gracious collaborator; he’s a knowledgeable, curious, and versatile musician, not just a button-pressing nerd; he’s a maturing artist and normal dude, closer to that guy you see at your local bar’s hip-hop night than some fame-starved egomaniac. Most importantly, he’s trying to send a message out of some musical version of The Elephant Man: I am not a trap lord! I am a human being! It’s the one constant in every interview he’s conducted in advance of the album’s release: Mohawke has been stifled — trapped, you might say — by one specific branch of his successful career. Lantern is his escape plan. HudMo is trying to send a message: ""I am not a trap lord! I am a human being!"" After a formative period spent in DJ competitions and PlayStation music programs, then-21-year-old, Glaswegian-born Ross Birchard signed to venerable British electronic label Warp in 2007 as Hudson Mohawke; two years after that, he released Butter, a Ritalin-addled explosion of funk, soul, and colourful, cluster-bomb synths. By 2011, Mohawke’s new material was glittering and mammoth, pairing the rhythm and structure of hip-hop with the synthetic textures and sharpness of electronic music. When he partnered with Canadian DJ Lunice as TNGHT for an eponymous EP a year later, they ended up laying the groundwork for an entire subgenre of dance music. From ""Harlem Shake"" and ""Turn Down for What"" to festival stages around the world, EDM trap fused the trunk-rattling bombast of Southern hip-hop with the more-more-more dynamics of American dubstep. TNGHT did it early and did it best, with brain-melting bangers like ""Goooo"" and ""Higher Ground"" that whacked festival crowds like punches from cartoon superheroes. I can personally attest to their insane impact: one of my most memorable live moments involves Flying Lotus dropping an as-yet-unreleased ""Higher Ground"" into his DJ set at Pitchfork’s music festival in 2012. I’ve never seen or felt a crowd move like that before. TNGHT’s success vaulted Mohawke and Lunice to new heights; at the same time, Mohawke signed a contract with Kanye West’s label G.O.O.D. Music and was part of the massive crew behind West’s Yeezus, the 2013 acid bath that reset the rapper’s musical career. Production work for rappers like Pusha T and Drake soon followed. A reaction to one-dimensional, over-the-top masculinity It all sounds rosy, but there was one problem: in Mohawke’s eyes, his phenomenal success as both a hip-hop producer and one of the forefathers of trap was belying his voracious, omnivorous musical interests. After announcing TNGHT’s indefinite hiatus at the end of 2013, Mohawke doubled down on finishing his long-awaited second full-length. And now that Lantern is out in the wild, everything about it feels like a reaction to the one-dimensional, over-the-top masculinity that’s come to define Mohawke’s descendants post-TNGHT. The album is consciously couched in the rhetoric of ""true artistry"": Mohawke’s talked about gleaning his ""executive producer"" approach from Kanye, the album’s diverse array of guests, its conceptual underpinnings, and its breadth of styles and sounds. (Electronic music’s still vulnerable to the sinister creep of traditional ideas about musical legitimacy, even in its position at the vanguard of genres.) Mohawke’s Glaswegian contemporary (and labelmate) Russell Whyte, the maximalist producer who records as Rustie, made a very similar play last year with his own second full-length, Green Language. In attempting to make a more nuanced and comprehensive artistic statement, he ended up largely stripping his music of the intensity and vitality that won him plaudits in the first place. Even if Lantern appeals to a certain strain of musical conservatism, it’s not a risk-free gambit. The component parts are familiar, but there's brightness and levity Mohawke succeeds, in large part because he compensates for a lack of sheer magnitude with thoughtfulness and balance. ""Scud Books"" is a great example: its component parts are familiar, with horns out of the Imperial March and an elephant stomp of a beat, but there’s a brightness and levity to its doodling synths and spry handclaps. It’s been cleansed of any menace that might have rendered it oppressive. Similarly, while ""Lil Djembe"" isn’t that structurally innovative — it wouldn’t feel out of place on the TNGHT EP in that regard — it’s pushed off-kilter by eerie, toy box-like percussive elements. And for every textbook-adjacent heater like the ones mentioned above, Mohawke tries his hand as a different genre somewhere else: the modern classical of Philip Glass and Steve Reich (via Emeralds) on ""Kettles"" and ""System,"" ""The Final Countdown"" gone French touch of closer ""Brand New World,"" moody Prince-aping funk on Jhené Aiko collaboration ""The Resistance."" Once more likely to wow you with texture, dynamics, and pure force than melody, Mohawke’s discovered a newfound gentleness and sentiment, especially on the album’s strong vocal features. He told The Verge’s own Emily Yoshida last week that ""leaving space for vocals is something [he’s] worked on learning over the last two or three years,"" and that work has paid off. He gives guests room to shine and highlights their best qualities, whether cocooning Antony’s soft tenor in his own sampled vocals or giving Miguel room to butt up against the end of a microphone’s range over grainy, faraway synths. Best of all is ""Ryderz,"" which charts an entirely new path forward for Mohawke: working over a sample of D.J. Rogers’ 1973 cut ""Watch Out for the Riders,"" he pays homage to the deft, soulful work of hip-hop producers like Just Blaze and the young Kanye West, arranging with patience and real joy. It’s proof positive that Mohawke can match the effectiveness of TNGHT’s titanic jams without falling back on the same old tricks, and the thought of that compromise worming its way into his work for his other artists is really exciting. Lantern may not inspire any new genres, but it accomplishes what Mohawke set out to achieve: it frees him from the legacy of trap and confirms his worth as an inquisitive, eager artist.

This is the time when all the giants of popular gaming make their big announcements, competing for your attention and future gaming dollars. Today is also a big day for YouTube, which doesn't make games, but will soon be introducing a dedicated YouTube Gaming service. It too will be competing for the attention of millions. The goals of YouTube Gaming are as grand as YouTube itself. Google wants its new website and app to become ""the biggest community of gamers on the web"" and the destination for live-streamed game video, whether it comes from professional tournaments or amateurs playing just for fun. If that sounds exactly like Twitch, that's because it is. Having lost out to Amazon in the pursuit to acquire Twitch last summer, Google has spent the past year building up its own alternative, and that's what we have to look forward to in the coming weeks.  There'll be more ways to watch E3 live than ever The clash between YouTube Gaming and Twitch gets an early preview today. Google has set up a shiny new E3 hub over at youtube.com/e3, which will play host to ""a 12-hour live stream marathon"" filled with interviews, commentary, and exclusive demos of the newly announced games. Well-known YouTube gamers and more conventional celebrities will offer their reactions to the news as it happens, and the big press conferences will also be broadcast live. Twitch is already up and running on the streaming front, having hosted the Nintendo World Championships and Bethesda's first ever E3 showcase, and it is also the official streaming partner of E3. Just like YouTube, Twitch is investing in generating its own content, with a dedicated stage on the E3 show floor populated by some of Twitch's star broadcasters and an exclusive PC Gaming Show event stream scheduled for Tuesday. YouTube has tried producing live events before, and they've been comically bad E3 presents a great opportunity for YouTube to assert itself as a legitimate competitor to Twitch, because it's a one-off event. Twitch is still the game streaming capital of the web and commands an audience of tens of millions, but YouTube can claim a significant share of that group for a brief period of time by having more interesting and compelling E3 content. Tony Hawk, Felicia Day, Xbox chief Phil Spencer, and Oculus founder Palmer Luckey will all be dropping by to chat with YouTube host Geoff Keighley. It's enough if you find just one of those names appealing: the point is to present YouTube as a credible source of live gaming content, whether it be news, interviews, gameplay, or whatever else. That being said, YouTube has tried producing live events before, and they've been comically bad, so Google will have to improve the way it executes what are otherwise sensible plans. The excitement surrounding E3 is simply a concentrated, one-week dose of the passion that video games are enveloped in year round. Capturing even a snippet of it now will stand YouTube and YouTube Gaming in good stead for the future. And although the E3 schedule pits YouTube and Twitch as direct competitors covering the same events and fighting for the same audience, the primary business of streaming pseudo-amateur, personality-based content should be big enough for them to coexist in relative harmony. If the gaming world is big enough to have both Dota 2 and League of Legends, then it's big enough to have both Twitch and YouTube Gaming.",0.5900592639325798,0.4099407360674202,0.6889910768423894,599,4.9348914858096826,327,5.9724770642201834,0,0,"Culture, E3 2015, Entertainment, Gaming, Web, Report",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

But I’m pretty sure the Oculus Rift will mark my return to gaming. My exile wasn’t entirely of my own design. While friends would eventually own Atari and Sega and Nintendo systems, my parents made the brash decision to forbid gaming in favor of doing stuff, any stuff as long as it was outside and away from the TV. As an adult I’ve met each new generation of game consoles with the same wistful declaration: this is the year I return to gaming. Then I read reviews that downgrade the features I’d been excited by to mere gimmicks, until finally I just throw up my hands and say, ok, let's see what comes next. What’s next is virtual reality. VR draws a bold line between what we’ve known as gaming and what’s yet to come. In that respect the Rift is perfectly named:  Rift | noun | A crack, split, or break in something. Even the Oculus logo is brilliant, resembling both an eye of cybernetic design and a port for jacking your brain into another world.  Maybe I’m wrong about Oculus. Maybe the headset I buy will be from Sony, Valve/HTC, Microsoft, or Razer. We’ll certainly learn more at E3 this week and the nine months or so before the Rift and peripherals are released. But I’m not wrong about the promise of VR. I was lucky enough to be in the room when Oculus had its big coming out party three years ago. I’ve since tried Rift in all its physical incarnations for gaming, art, and immersive story telling. It’s not just next generation gaming — it’s next gen entertainment. My parents are gone but I can still hear their cautionary tones. Still, I think they’d be fine knowing that I was about to go outside and experience the future, even if I’m just sitting in front of the TV. It seems like only yesterday we got our first confirmation that Fallout 4 existed (seven years of unofficial anticipation notwithstanding). And now on the eve of E3 2015, Bethesda is giving us a real look at the game. More importantly, a release date: November 10th, 2015 for Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and PC. The collector's edition of the game will include an actual Pip-Boy wearable sleeve that you can slot your phone into, meaning you'll be able to access all of the features just by glancing down at your IRL arm. ""As far as stupid gimmicks go, I chose the best fucking one,"" said Bethesda's Todd Howard on stage at E3. At the end of the demo, the hero cuts through the humanoid demons with a chainsaw in a variety of angles to show that for him, dismemberment isn't a job — it's a craft. The new Doom runs on the id Tech 6 game engine, and it's the first game to do so. The engine and the game look noticeably better than id Tech 5 games, like Rage and the most recent reboot of Wolfenstein. Jurassic World has turned into quite the blockbuster hit. The film has crushed industry estimates, and has raked in a record $511.8 million globally, making it the first to ever break half a billion dollars over its opening weekend. That number comes from $204.6 million domestically, just shy of The Avengers' record $207.4 million weekend haul in 2012. Look at these jiggly GIFs! They're the work of Sam Lyon, the guy behind the deliriously strange Tumblr Jelly Gummies. Lyon makes gelatinous dancing dolphins, sticky bubblegum faces, wobbling starfish, and alien babies with slimy Jello tongues — plus a bunch of weird unnamable stuff.

And Motorola's announcement actually confirms one important thing: the new Moto G now includes LTE as part of its standard model. That hasn't been the case until now, and it was one of the low-cost smartphone's biggest downsides. With this new model, which Motorola is releasing today, the Moto G becomes an even more compelling choice for people looking for a cheap smartphone.

LTE is now in every configuration of the Moto G  The new Moto G keeps the same 5-inch, 720p display specs as last year's model, but the outside of the phone has still seen some improvements. The new model borrows some of the Moto X's style, and it can also be customized through Moto Maker for the first time.

It now includes a 13-megapixel rear camera, up from 8 megapixels. Motorola says it's the same camera in use on the Nexus 6, calling it ""best in class"" and optimized specifically for this phone. The phone comes in two configurations with either 1GB of RAM and 8GB of storage or 2GB of RAM and 16GB of storage. It also includes a microSD slot, a 5-megapixel front camera, and basic waterproofing. It's running Android 5.1 Lollipop, which, as usual, Motorola is keeping pretty close to stock. Motorola says that last year's G was a big hit for it. This year's model doesn't change the formula much, but it updates the phone in all the right areas. LTE was always one of the big areas where the G came up short, and Motorola even promises that we'll get good photos from it this year. The phone's pricing starts at $179.99 for its 8GB model — the same price that its predecessors started at — so Motorola shouldn't have much of a problem winning over existing fans.

The Moto X is Motorola's flagship smartphone, and now's the time of year that it unveils a new one. The most noticeable change this time around is expected to be a size bump to a 5.5-inch display, up from the current model's 5.2-inch display. Reports are conflicting, but the display may either stay at a 1080p resolution or jump up to Quad HD, as other flagships have in the past year. The Moto X continues to grow Similar changes are expected on the inside. The new Moto X is believed to have a Snapdragon 808 processor, a substantially larger battery, a microSD card slot, and a 21-megapixel rear camera. The Moto X's camera has always been a sore spot — and megapixel count doesn't mean much when it comes to quality — so the real hope is that Motorola has put a nicer sensor and some much-improved processing behind it. Otherwise, you can expect standbys of the Moto X to stick around. That includes a wide array of options for how to customize the device's look, a metal rim around the edges, and a dimple in the back with Motorola's ""M"" inside of it. It's a relatively good-looking phone — no need to change what already works.   At 5.5 inches, the new Moto X will be kind of big. As in, it'll be the same size as Apple's ""Plus"" model. Fortunately, Motorola is expected to unveil a phone that's fit for people with smaller hands and pockets. The Moto X Sport — a brand new offshoot of the Moto X — is supposed to be the answer. It's believed to have a 5.2-inch display, which would match it up with 2014's Moto X. Details are slim on the Sport Other than that, there really aren't many details on the Sport — in fact, if it weren't for Motorola's own hints at a second ""X"" device, it'd be hard to believe that this one was even real. But there are a few other details we can guess at. Given the ""Sport"" name, it seems safe to assume that the phone will have basic shock resistance and waterproofing. It's also expected to have lower specs than the flagship Moto X; given its size, perhaps we'll be looking at something similar to last year's flagship.   The Moto G continues to be the best low-cost smartphone you can buy, and it looks like Motorola is about to give it a nice refresh. In fact, we basically know it is, because almost every detail of the new phone has leaked out. The G's most exciting change is style The biggest change to the Moto G may not be specs, but looks. Motorola appears to be bringing Moto X-style customizations to the Moto G through Moto Maker. That means buyers will be able to choose different colors for its face, its back, and its accents. It's the same system that's made choosing a Moto X way more interesting than picking out which color iPhone you want. The Moto G's body is expected to keep its 5-inch display, with either a 720p or 1080p resolution. It also includes a 5-megapixel front camera, a 13-megapixel rear camera, dual micro-SIM slots, and up to 16GB of storage and 2GB of RAM. It may also include a Snapdragon 410 processor, which would make this the year that the Moto G's base model starts including LTE. Both of the Moto G's earlier models went on sale for around $179 off contract — if this model keeps the price, it should be a solid update.",0.6777216054551093,0.3222783945448907,0.18706577387328463,764,4.3769633507853403,395,5.5139240506329115,0,4,"Google, Mobile, Tech",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I’ve been using it on and off as a beta tester for months now, and I'm already running the final build ahead of tonight's big release. But I’m not going to switch. Not now. Unlike Chaz_UK I’m too entrenched in Apple hardware and Google services. I’m not supposing my experience is representative of yours or even the majority of people. Despite the MacBook’s apparent dominance in trendy cafes, 9 Windows PCs are sold for every computer running OS X.    My switch from the PC to Mac started on Christmas day 2001 when I was gifted an original 5GB iPod with click-wheel. I was so impressed that I returned to New York and promptly bought a Power Mac G4 (I also had no choice as the iPod was Mac-only at launch). My switch from Microsoft to Google services began with Gmail back in 2004. I switched from Hotmail because my default search engine offered better spam protections and filtering. Soon I was on Docs, happily eschewing the Office bloatware I was required to use at work. There was a time when I could see jumping back to Windows. I’d buy an Xbox which would entice me to buy a Zune and then a Windows Phone and then a Surface. But it took Microsoft too long to turn its silos into a holistic ecosystem. And now that Ballmer’s gone, Microsoft is abandoning its grand device strategy and embracing iOS and Android device owners with a deluge of new software and services. Thing is, Apple and Google already provide me with everything I need — and I’m satisfied, happy even. Besides, upending my digital life to get the same result down a different path is not a great use of my time. As a former IT manager, I understand the efficiencies of cost and support achieved through standardization. My wife and I use newer iPhones, iPads, and MacBooks while the kids tussle for the digital hand-me-downs. I’m also thinking of buying an Apple Watch for my wife and HomeKit-compatible automation devices for the home. And the accessories, all those Made for iPhone/iPod/iPad accessories we’ve accumulated over the years, in addition to hundreds of OS X and iOS apps and games we’ve purchased — I'm not going to throw all that away for a few nice to have features exclusive to Windows and Microsoft apps. And you can’t beat free for best-in-class services like Google Photos and Maps — even if I have to give up some perceived privacy in the process. Not that Microsoft cares about me. Oh sure, it’s courting iPhone and Android users who also have Windows PCs at home and work (which is almost all of them), but my wife and I are full-time Mac users, too — both professionally and by personal choice. We're a niche that Redmond can ignore for now. My kids, though, are another story. Microsoft cares deeply about the next generation who’ll be living in a world dominated by realities both augmented and virtual, unencumbered by the hardware wars from the days of yore. And right now, Microsoft is beating Apple two-to-one for my kids’ attention in their three respective schools — Google hasn’t even bothered to show up. So, you could say that I’m married to Apple with a little somethin’ somethin’ from Google on the side. Even with a perfect 10 Microsoft barely stands a chance at luring me away. But it’s okay to look, right?  After nine months of waiting, Windows 10 is almost here. Tuesday night at midnight ET, Microsoft will release the first full release of Windows 10, the biggest sea change in PC software in nearly three years. It's kind of a big deal! We've been getting previews of Windows 10 since October, and the rollout of the actual software will happen in stages, but midnight will still be zero hour for answering a lot of the questions that have swirled around Windows 10 since it was first announced. How do you build a single OS for laptops, tablets, and smartphones? Tuesday night, we'll find out. There are more options than ever for getting a good, cheap smartphone, and last year’s OnePlus One was a standout. For $300, you got a well-made, nice-looking phone with cutting-edge hardware and few compromises to be found (assuming its 5.5-inch size didn’t put you off). The just-announced, heavily-leaked OnePlus 2 doesn’t deviate strongly from the formula that made the One such an intriguing phone, but there are some notable differences to be found once you dig into the new device. Samsung today officially announced its next major product launch event, which will take place in New York on August 13th. Galaxy Unpacked 2015 will be at 11:00AM ET on that date, and will likely include the announcement of the Galaxy Note 5 and Galaxy S6 Edge Plus, the details of which have leaked extensively over the past few weeks. The next mainline entry in arguably the most popular game series of all time in Japan has just been announced. Dragon Quest XI is coming to both the PlayStation 4 and the 3DS, according to a live broadcast currently underway in Japan, with a release date targeted for next year. The PlayStation 4 version is being developed internally at Square Enix, and will use the Unreal Engine. The 3DS version, meanwhile, is like two games in one — it runs in full 3D on the top screen and uses retro 2D sprites on the bottom. Oddly, Square Enix also announced a version for NX, the upcoming Nintendo system that we know basically nothing about. Bugs Bunny, one of the most beloved and enduring characters of the 20th century, turns 75 today. That's a major milestone for any American pop culture icon, putting him on a plane right beside the likes of Superman in terms of sheer longevity. As a cartoon character, he's a legend; many of us, along with our parents, grew up with him. He even has his own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. But if anyone asked you who the single greatest cartoon character ever created was, you might waffle. It's really not that hard. Bugs is GOAT.

The best email apps tend to do more than just manage your mail — they make it easy to view your calendar, contacts, and file attachments all in one place. Today, Boxer is joining that crowd with version 6.0 of its email app, which brings along a full-fledged calendar app. Boxer 6.0 introduces a refreshed design of Boxer's email experience, with updated visuals and performance. But the real appeal is the new calendar app, which is integrated into the iOS version of Boxer email and available as a stand-alone app for Android. It allows you to view your calendar right from your email and quickly share availability with others. You can also accept or decline meeting invitations without ever leaving your inbox. The iOS version also includes built-in contact management. It's very similar to the integrated experiences Outlook and Spark email offer on the iPhone. Boxer says that more integration features between email and calendar will be coming soon.   Aside from the new calendar integrations, Boxer email supports a variety of email services and accounts, including Gmail, Google Apps, Outlook, Yahoo, iCloud, and Exchange. It has support for push notifications, swipe gestures for inbox management, integrated quick replies, and threaded messaging. One thing that Boxer doesn't yet support is a prioritization of messages based on sender, like Outlook's Focused inbox or Gmail's Priority inbox. Boxer's email and calendar apps are the defaults on Cyanogen devices, and the new versions will be available on that platform in the coming months.

The Department of Veterans Affairs' brain repository, based in Massachusetts, found that 76 of 79 former pro players had evidence of the condition, which can be caused by repeated head trauma. The brains were submitted for study after death The findings came as part of a wider study in which the department examined the brains of 128 deceased football players who had played the game at professional, semi-professional, college, or high school level. It found that even in the brains of those that had played at lower standards, the rate of CTE was high — of the 128 players, 101 tested positive for the disease. The brain condition is caused when blows to the head cause the production of tau, a protein that manifests as dense tangles around the brain's normal cells and blood vessels. The degenerative condition can cause depression and fits of rage among its sufferers, and confusion, memory loss, and dementia later in life. The Department of Veterans Affairs' findings come from a weighted testing group — the experiments were conducted on brains donated to the brain repository by players and families who suspected the presence of the condition — but neuropathologist Dr. Ann McKee, who directs the brain bank, says that there's a correlation between playing football and developing CTE. ""Playing football, and the higher the level you play football and the longer you play football, the higher your risk."" CTE can cause depression, fits of rage, and dementia The NFL is currently responding to a lawsuit brought against it by more than 4,500 ex-players. The new Department of Veterans Affairs' report comes two weeks before an October 14th deadline at which thousands of NFL retirees have to decide whether to agree to the league's proposed settlement. Frontline says the ex-players have accused the league of hiding links between football and CTE, but these findings could help address ""a key sticking point"" in negotiations now that the league has acknowledged long-term concussion effects. Data filed in a federal court this month shows the NFL actually ""expects nearly a third of all retired players to develop a long-term cognitive problem, such as Alzheimer's disease or dementia, as a result of football."" Recent advances in medical science have allowed doctors to preliminarily detect CTE while the sufferer is still alive, but Frontline says the condition can currently only be conclusively detected after death. Autopsies on a number of high-profile NFL players have shown that they were suffering from CTE, which might have influenced their behaviour. Chris Henry, a wide receiver for the Cincinatti Bengals, was found to have evidence of the condition in his brain when he died at 26. Henry's once-promising career was blighted by arrests for assault and drug use before he died from injuries sustained a car crash in 2009. Earlier this week, ESPN reported that ex-Kansas City Chiefs linebacker Jovan Belcher, who shot and killed his girlfriend before turning his gun on himself in the Chiefs' parking lot last year, was suffering from CTE when he died. Mike Webster, the Steelers center whose autopsy in 2002 kickstarted the investigation into degenerative brain diseases in football players, died homeless and living in a truck. Retired NFL players have been offered a settlement by the league Other players who suspected they might be left permanently suffering from the after-effects of repeated blows to the head committed suicide in such a way that their brains could be left to science. Dave Duerson and Junior Seau, both top-level defensive players who spent a decade or more in the NFL, shot themselves in the chest so their brains could be studied after death, in the hopes of helping others avoid or manage CTE.",0.3655519542850242,0.6344480457149758,0.8722987943954875,668,5.1781437125748502,349,6.3180515759312321,0,0,Science,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The patient had already been placed in isolation because of his symptoms and because he had recently traveled to Liberia, which is experiencing an epidemic, before two tests confirmed the disease. This patient is the first to be diagnosed outside Africa with the strain that is currently epidemic there, said CDC director Thomas Frieden, during a conference call with reporters. The outbreak has largely been concentrated in three countries: Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, where 6,574 have been sickened and 3,091 have died so far. ""I have no doubt we will control this importation of Ebola so it does not spread widely in this country,"" Frieden said. The patient came to the US to visit family members here and stayed with them, said Frieden. People who shared a flight with him are not at risk for developing Ebola, as patients don't spread the disease until they have symptoms. This patient's symptoms developed four days after the flight. Two days later, on September 26, he sought care, and he was admitted to a hospital and placed in isolation on September 28. The patient wasn't hospitalized right away because early Ebola symptoms look a lot like many other diseases, Frieden says. ""Only someone sick can spread the disease,"" Frieden says. So anyone the patient was in contact with starting on September 20, is being tracked by public health authorities. They'll be tracked for 21 days; after that, if the disease hasn't developed, it won't. That means that people on the flight from Africa with the patient aren't at risk — only a ""handful"" of people, including the patient's family, have been exposed. The patient doesn't appear to have been involved in the Ebola response effort, and won't be moved to a different hospital, since any hospital with an isolation ward can do isolation for Ebola, Frieden says. He declined to say how sick the patient was or what treatment he was receiving, citing privacy concerns. This isn't the first Ebola patient being treated for the disease in the US, or the first case of a hemorrhagic fever being diagnosed here. Four other hemorrhagic fever patients have been treated here, and one in 2007 had Marburg virus, which is very similar to Ebola. Ebola can be controlled through routine hand-washing and by using gloves and other barriers to prevent contact with infectious bodily fluids. Ebola can't be spread through the air; only direct contact with the body fluids of a patient who is showing symptoms will spread the disease.",0.33295893581021896,0.667041064189781,0.8532037032989063,453,4.9426048565121414,247,5.6518218623481777,0,0,"Science, US & World, Breaking",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Not because of any specific disease, but because climate change will cause an 250,000 additional deaths per year between 2030 and 2050, by the WHO's own estimate. ""WHO has shown important leadership on climate change but has stopped short of declaring a global public health emergency,"" writes BMJ editor-in-chief Fiona Godlee, in an editorial. But the evidence that climate change poses a ""threat to human health and survival"" is strong, she writes, and it's time to act. Dwindling fresh water supplies, increased soil erosion, heat stress, malnutrition, malaria and extreme weather will have catastrophic effects on human health, if humanity doesn't act fast. The BMJ therefore hopes to change attitudes within the healthcare system, which is itself ""a major emitter of greenhouse gases,"" Godlee writes, due to the amount of waste it produces and the energy it consumes. doctors should ""become effective advocates against climate change."" To get the point across, the journal published a climate change guide in early September that addressed itself to doctors, but did not contain information about medicine or healthcare. Instead, the guide answered questions such as ""Is global warming unequivocally the result of human activity?"" (answer: for the most part, yes), and ""What will future climate change be like?"" (answer: further and more drastic changes are expected). The guide also called on health professionals to explain climate change to their patients in terms of its health consequences. It’s ""pure climate science,"" Godlee says, ""because if we doctors are to become effective advocates against climate change, a better understanding of the science will help us."" Given the Ebola crisis, it's understandable that WHO has yet to declare a public health emergency, Godlee writes. But it shouldn't put this off any longer. ""Deaths from Ebola infection, tragic and frightening though they are, will pale into insignificance when compared with the mayhem we can expect for our children and grandchildren if the world does nothing to check its carbon emissions."" So if we truly want to prevent such a catastrophe, she writes, ""action is needed now.""",0.6468578654802652,0.35314213451973475,0.8525819030015315,371,5.401617250673854,241,6.203319502074689,0,0,"Science, US & World",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Much like her own child, the American girl had been born with HIV, and had immediately received antiretroviral therapy following her birth. Now, doctors were announcing that the Mississippi baby had remained virus free for 10 months after stopping the treatment. Aggressive, early intervention had cured her, doctors said. So, when the mother in Italy saw the good news, she asked her child’s physicians to do the same. She wanted her three-year-old off the drugs, and they agreed. the mother heard about the Mississippi baby, and wanted her kid off the drugs too ""We thought that we had achieved a cure, since the virus has been absent from the child’s body for three years,"" says Mario Clerici, an infectious disease researcher at the University of Milan in Italy and the co-author of a case report relating the child’s story in The Lancet today. ""So when the mom asked us, we took him off the drugs, because apparently the Mississippi baby had been cured."" Before stopping treatment, the child tested negative for HIV. Even so, two weeks after stopping treatment, the virus was back. ""All the world believed that it could be done, that if you started treating kids early, and then took took them off the drugs, you could achieve a cure,"" Clerici says. ""But that’s not the case."" After the child's physicians took him off the drugs, they ran an immune system test — one that the Mississippi child never received, Clerici says. ""We did in-depth, sophisticated immune testing, and what we saw was that the virus was still there, hiding."" This, the researcher says, means that even when there appears to be no virus in a person's body, it leaves a detectable trace on the immune system. The Italian child’s condition represents another big blow for researchers who think early, aggressive antiretroviral therapy can rid an infant’s body of HIV, Clerici says. The first one came in July, when doctors announced that the Mississippi baby’s virus had returned after 23 months off therapy. But Yvonne Bryson, a pediatrician at the University of California Los Angeles, doesn’t see it that way. ""Staying virus free for 23 months is unheard of,"" she says, and anything that allows a child to be off drugs for a certain amount of time is an improvement. ""All the world believed that it could be done, that if you started treating kids early... you could achieve a cure."" Bryson is one of the researchers involved in a federally funded clinical trial in which doctors will give early, aggressive treatment to over 50 babies born with HIV. The trial, she says, will begin recruiting patients within the week. ""We did reevaluate the whole clinical trial after the Mississippi baby,"" she says, ""and many people in science and in the cure agenda felt like it was really important that it go ahead."" As for the child in Italy, Bryson says that she isn’t surprised. ""I suspect there will be more babies who are treated early, and who see the virus return,"" she says. The treatment’s success doesn’t just depend on its timing. It's also about what drugs are used, whether they're received in significant enough doses, and how high a child’s viral load — a measure of the quantity of virus in a person — is at birth. In the case of the child in Milan, his viral load was higher at birth than that of the Mississippi child. This indicates that he was probably infected in the womb, instead of during his birth, Bryson says — a detail that may have allowed the virus to become more entrenched in his cells. Moreover, the Milan baby was given a lower dose of drugs than the Mississippi baby during the first few days of his treatment. In addition, it took three months for his viral load to drop all the way down. ""So in this case,"" she says, ""they didn’t reduce the amount of virus in the reservoir as much as in the Mississippi baby."" It took three months for the Italian baby's viral load to drop completely Regardless of these differences, Clerici thinks that the clinical trial shouldn’t take place. ""Ethically I don’t think they will be able to do it because both the Mississippi child and this one aren’t saved,"" he says. ""I think they’ll have to put the trial on hold."" The Mississippi baby wasn't the only ""functionally cured"" child in the US. In March, researchers announced that a baby girl in Long Beach had received early treatment, and was now in remission. She had not yet been taken off antiretroviral therapy, however. ""The results from the time that we reported in March have not changed, and the child is still considered ‘functionally cured,’"" says Audra Deveikis, the pediatrician who first diagnosed the baby with HIV. But news of the child in Italy is ""a major concern,"" she says, because ""it tells us that there’s a lot of stuff about HIV that we don’t know."" For now, there are no plans to stop the Long Beach baby's treatment. ""We are learning more with each case,""  Bryson says, and no one expects to see a lot of cases with the same results. ""It will take time,"" she says, but ""we’re still thinking that some cases might have an even better result than the Mississippi baby.""",0.36532156521907966,0.6346784347809203,0.8606360458331485,927,4.7594390507011868,414,5.7270531400966185,0,0,"Science, Report",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

O'Keefe will share the 8 million Swedish krona ($1.1 million) award with May-Britt and Edvard Moser, a husband-and-wife team from Norway. Their discoveries have shed light on how the brain maps and navigates spaces, and may lead to a better understanding of Alzheimer's disease. O'Keefe, a professor at University College of London, made his breakthrough discovery in 1971, when he observed so-called ""place cells"" in rat brains. Certain nerve cells were always activated when the rats were in one part of the room, and others were activated when they moved to different areas. This led him to to the conclusion that these place cells, located in the hippocampus part of the brain, constitute a map of the space that is stored in the rats' memory. The Mosers expanded on O'Keefe's work in 2005, when they discovered ""grid cells"" — nerve cells that form a coordinate system in rat brains, allowing for precise spatial navigation. These cells are located in the entorhinal cortex, near the hippocampus, and were activated when the rats moved through paths. The hexagonal grid cells work together with place cells to form a ""comprehensive positioning system"" that allow for recognition and navigation of environments.  Recent studies have shown that similar systems exist in human brains, as well. Understanding how the brain maps and navigates spaces could prove critical for people suffering from Alzheimer's disease, which affects the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, leaving many patients disoriented and incapable of recognizing their surroundings. May-Britt and Edvard Moser are both professors at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim. With today's announcement, May-Britt Moser becomes the 11th woman to receive the Nobel Prize in medicine since 1901, when the first prize was awarded.

They live in tropical areas of the world, and don’t get as much press as the North American populations that show up en masse on weather radars. But for scientists who study monarchs, they’re critical to understanding the bugs. They’re the reason that most researchers think that these insects first evolved in South America as a non-migratory species, and only started migrating a few hundred years ago, once they moved into the US. And, if a study published today in Nature is further supported, they’ll also be the reason that we were just plain wrong. It’s easier to imagine migration as a recent occurrence Most people — including scientists — think of migration when they think of monarchs, said Marcus Kronforst, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Chicago and a co-author of the study. That may be why so many biologists think that this behavior is one that the butterflies evolved into having, rather than one that came standard and which some monarchs subsequently lost. But today's study suggests that migration predates stationary monarchs. By taking genetic data from over 100 butterflies and mapping it out, the researchers were able to establish that not only did the monarch start out as a migratory species, but that the non-migratory populations that live in Europe, South America, and Hawaii are actually the product of independent dispersal events. ""It looks like the most closely related butterfly to the monarch itself — the southern monarch — is also migratory,"" Kronforst says. Which means that at some point, millions of years ago, a butterfly evolved migration, and then split into two separate species. This, Kronforst says, is how the migratory North American Monarch came to be. This is how the migratory North American Monarch came to be But that was far from the researchers’ most surprising finding. Because, as it turns out, only a tiny part of the butterfly's genome substantially contributes to monarch migration. And every time the researchers ran their analyses, a single gene popped up as being wildly different when comparing migratory and nonmigratory populations — a gene that’s actually related to flight muscle function. It participates in muscle metabolism, so when it’s expressed at high levels, it helps butterflies fly more powerfully. ""So clearly, we thought the migratory monarchs would have more of this gene,"" he says. But when they put monarchs in flight chambers, the researchers realized that this simply wasn’t the case. Migratory monarchs don't express the gene as much, so when they travel long distances, they consume less oxygen, and are therefore more efficient. ""And they don't show that difference when they aren't flying,"" Kronforst says, ""so we know it’s related to this gene."" ""Of all that things this gene could be involved in, it’s related to flight efficiency.""  If he has to guess, Kronforst says, his bet would be that butterflies who don’t migrate probably need to fly harder and faster so they can chase mates or evade predators. Migratory monarchs don’t experience the intense competitive pressures that non-migratory butterflies do, Kronforst says, so they can get away with having slower metabolisms and flying more slowly. ""The section on demographic history is spectacular,"" says Francis Villablanca, an evolutionary biologist at  California Polytechnic State University who did not participate in the  study. The paper, he says, provides answers to many questions that  researchers have long wished someone could answer.  ""In one fell swoop, this paper provides the context for us to be able to think about and understand the origin of and the differences between populations."" The study’s findings also matter for monarch conservation, Villablanca says. Monarch populations have been dwindling because humans have waged a war against the monarch’s host plant, the milkweed. But this study shows that each monarch population is genetically unique, which means protecting as many monarch populations as we can suddenly becomes more important. ""They may all be descendants of an ancestral North American population,"" he says, ""but it would be difficult to recreate any of them because now they contain unique characteristics."" ""it would be difficult to recreate any of them."" Moreover, Kronforst says, most scientists think that monarch migration is just a few hundred years old. But his study’s results suggest that the behavior is much older than that — thousands upon thousands of years older. So ""if you think of migration as just being a very recently evolved thing, then maybe you care less if it disappears,"" he says. But ""it’s actually very old, and we might be witnessing the very last days of it."" For some reason, he says, that seems far worse.",0.3531034079055342,0.6468965920944658,0.7205556643129502,786,5.2315521628498729,396,6.1868686868686869,0,0,"Science, Report",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The legislation is meant to cut down on waste throughout the state and to help protect its land from pollution. The ban will begin this coming July in grocery stores and pharmacies, and it'll expand to convenience stores and liquor stores one year later. ""This bill is a step in the right direction,"" California Governor Jerry Brown says in a statement. ""It reduces the torrent of plastic polluting our beaches, parks, and even the vast ocean itself.  ""We’re the first to ban these bags, and we won’t be the last"" The ban is estimated to cut California off from using over 13 billion single-use plastic bags each year. Some plastic bags will still be allowed, however, such as those used to wrap up an open food item or to protect hung up clothing. The state will also provide $2 million in loans to businesses that will begin moving away from manufacturing plastic bags. Stores will be able to sell paper bags to consumers for 10 cents a piece. While that may sound frustrating, this isn't new for a good number of Californians: local plastic bag bans have already covered where 10 million residents live — about a quarter of its population. The law is a huge step, in particular, toward reducing ocean pollution. Legislation co-author Alex Padilla says that single-use bags kill thousands of marine animals each year. Plastic items in general are also estimated to account for 60 to 80 percent of marine debris. The National Resources Defense Council calls the legislation ""a thrilling win"" for ocean lovers. Plastic bag manufacturers are, unsurprisingly, pretty unhappy about the ban, with their trade group calling it a scam and a bad law. It also says that the legislation jeopardizes thousands of jobs. The trade group, the American Progressive Bag Alliance, hopes to have voters overturn the law through a referendum. California is confident that it's on the right track here, and environmentalists, naturally, are in agreement. It will, of course, take a lot more than just one state law to truly begin cleaning things up.

Creating the final product isn't exactly easy (there's a fair amount of soldering required, as well as access to a 3D printer to create the attachment that operates the spray can), but it's well within the grasp of any dedicated tinkerer. There's also an option to buy a graffiti drone pre-made, although KATSU told Vice that these orders would only be considered on a ""case-by-case basis."" The artist stressed that the challenge of building the ICARUS ONE is more than worth it: ""Imagine scrawling your name or a doodle 100 feet by 100 feet. Imagine sitting on a rooftop at night while your drone tags the building across the street.""  At the moment, though, controlled paintwork isn't something ICARUS is capable of. Videos of KATSU's drones in action (including a series of canvas artworks he produced in 2014) show that simply controlling the craft is a challenge. ""It’s like 50 percent me having control and 50 percent the drone kind of like saying, ‘I need to turn this way to accomplish what you want me to do but still maintain myself so I don’t just fly into the wall and explode.’ Which it does, all the time,"" KATSU told the Center for the Study of the Drone at Bard College last year. However, KATSU says this is only the beginning for the project. The artist claims that he's planning to develop a second version of the drone (named ICARUS TWO) that will use computer vision to let artists draw their tag on an iPad before the drone executes it automatically. It sounds ambitious, but KATSU is accustomed to dreaming big. When asked by VICE to name a graffiti target that conventional methods can't reach but ICARUS can, his reply is simple: ""Statue of Liberty's face.""",0.6177573457452326,0.38224265425476744,0.1963231036740329,482,4.7593360995850622,294,5.6360544217687076,1,0,"Culture, Tech",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The announcement mirrors a similar peering deal inked earlier this year made by Netflix and Comcast, and likely won't be the last of its kind. The details of the arrangement are currently confidential. However, they surely must come as a foregone conclusion at least for Verizon CEO Lowell McAdam, who said that he expected to sign a deal with the streaming company days after the Comcast agreement. However, the deal flies in the face of the stance Netflix has thus far espoused, saying that preferential treatment violates their definition of true and total net neutrality. In an impassioned blog post, CEO Reed Hastings wrote, ""The essence of net neutrality is that ISPs such as AT&T and Comcast don't restrict, influence or otherwise meddle with the choices consumers make."" After the company made what many saw as a Faustian pact with Comcast in February for direct connectivity, Hastings conceded that the company would reluctantly make deals of that kind going forward, while still fighting for net neutrality. Future deals are by now a sure bet Verizon has long had issues with Netflix streaming, causing observers to accuse the carrier of throttling the service. Even though the company has officially denied any issues on their end, it did imply that users having issues with content might be the fault of Netflix itself. With the new deal in place, those complaints will likely vanish. But it also means similar deals with other carriers are a sure bet.

Twitter posted solid financials and user growth today, but it wasn't enough to reassure Wall Street after the company's struggles last quarter. The company reported $250 million in revenue, more than double what it pulled in for the same quarter last year. But it also reported a net loss of $132 million for the period, more than four times what it lost in the first quarter of 2013. Investors were actually more concerned with its user growth than financials. Twitter added 14 million new people, more than it did last quarter, for a total of 255 million active users. Engagement was also up, an improvement over last quarter's decline. But total timeline views still remain below their 2013 peak, a troubling sign. CEO Dick Costolo said that some of this drop in timeline views is due to product changes. For example, by collecting a conversation between multiple people into a single stream, Costolo says new users have a better, simpler experience, which results in less clicking around. Twitter has a clear challenge ahead of it: how to connect with mainstream consumers and get its user growth moving in the right direction again. As its new chief operating officer Ali Rowghani told the Wall Street Journal this morning, it's all about ""the question of how do we really turbo-charge the natural, organic growth rate that we have.""  Anticipation was high for this quarter's results. Last quarter the company turned in some improved financials, but showed stagnant user growth and an actual decline in user engagement. All this has added up to a big drop for the stock, which is currently sitting around $40 a share, a more than 40 percent decline from its high at the start of this year. The stock is down more than 5 percent in after-hours trading based on today's earnings report. On the earnings call, Costolo called out big events like the Oscars, Olympics, and Super Bowl as major drivers of Twitter's advertising growth and signals that it was increasingly important to mainstream users. He noted that the company saw more than 3 billion views of Oscar-related tweets in the 48 hours after the event, an audience that puts it on scale with major services like YouTube. The company's challenge now is proving its relevance and reach beyond these massive televised events. We've already begun to see the results of Twitter's campaign to connect with basic users as it moves toward an image-heavy stream and profile pages that seems to bring it closer in style to its rival Facebook. ""There's a bunch of short-term tactical stuff that is already in process that will move the needle,"" says Rowghani. ""Over the medium-term we are going to make a bunch of enhancements to the way early users to our platform sort of become healthy and engaged users.""

As it is, Vegas is known as a place where out-of-towners can come and get crazy for a weekend, because ""whatever happens in Vegas stays in Vegas."" Throw legal marijuana into the mix, and you’ve got a potential stateside Amsterdam. As a result, Vegas has turned into a serious land grab for would-be marijuana entrepreneurs. ""Anybody who ever had any ambition to do something in the cannabis industry, whether they’re from CO, CA, they’re all looking at Las Vegas,"" says Leslie Bocskor, founding chairman of the Nevada Cannabis Industry Association, and a consultant and investment advisor to the cannabis industry at large. Those wanting to get involved in Nevada’s weed industry will have to take part in a bifurcated process: first apply for a permit with the county, then apply for the state’s approval. The state has not opened up its application process yet. And unlike most states in the country with legal medical marijuana, Nevada’s cannabis market will be for profit. That is, dispensaries won’t have to operate as collectives or cooperatives the way they do in California, for example. Nevada will also allow what’s known as ""full reciprocity"": people with medical marijuana cards from other states will be able buy cannabis in Nevada without having to get a new prescription or card. They’ll simply sign an affidavit when they enter their first dispensary. (And they'll have to stick to that dispensary, exclusively, for one month before trying another one.) ""People who aren't comfortable getting on an airplane with their medicine ... can get [it] when they arrive in Nevada."" Nevada officials are hoping this will make the state even more friendly to tourists, and those in the cannabis industry agree. ""People who aren’t comfortable getting on airplanes with their medicine now know they can get their medicine when they arrive in Nevada,"" says Kris Krane, a Phoenix, AZ-based consultant for the marijuana industry who also runs an incubator for startup cannabis companies. Colorado and Washington have fully legalized weed for recreational as well as medicinal use, so in theory it would seem like those states would be bigger markets for cannabis. But those with knowledge of the marijuana industry believe that Nevada, and Vegas in particular, represents an even greater opportunity. According to a recent survey by Love Home Swap, a home and rental trading site, the Las Vegas Strip attracted 39 million tourists last year, making it the most visited tourist attraction in the world over both the Eiffel Tower and Times Square. If even as small as 1 percent of tourists have — or obtain when they arrive — a medical marijuana card and buy weed in Vegas, the numbers will be huge. ""We’re looking at anywhere from a $600 million to $1.5 billion yearly market in Vegas,"" says Derek Peterson, CEO of the Irvine, CA- based hydroponics company, Terra Tech, who applied for licenses.  Derek Peterson, CEO of Terra Tech (Terra Tech) The competition is fierce: there are only 10 dispensary licenses being allocated for unincorporated Clark County, with a similarly limited number for growing operations, processing outfits (where marijuana could be turned into edibles), and testing labs. And the application requirements are enough to scare away all but the richest and best-connected players: prospective cannabis business owners have to prove they have $250,000 in liquid assets, on top of $35,000 in application and registration fees. They also have to submit to extensive background checks, not unlike those required for ""unlimited gaming licenses"" that are required to operate casinos in the state. Anybody wishing to legally sell weed near The Strip better be squeaky clean and majorly bankrolled ""There’s a saying in Nevada that it’s harder to get an unlimited gaming license than it is to become a Secret Service agent guarding the president,"" says Bocskor. Likewise, anybody wishing to legally sell weed near the Strip better be squeaky clean and majorly bankrolled. The similarities between the county’s gambling regulations and its weed-market regulations are by design. ""We have had a great experience with licensing gaming institutions, and we’ve brought that concept to bear here,"" says Richard ""Tick"" Segerblom, state senator for Nevada’s District 3, which encompasses the Strip. But don’t expect to see the Steve Wynns of the world — big-league casino operators — opening up pot clubs. Segerblom says the Nevada Gaming Commission and State Gaming Control Board have made it clear they would not look kindly on that, given that pot is still federally illegal. ""They’re very protective of our [gambling] industry, and they don’t want to do anything that will run afoul of the feds,"" Segerblom says. Applicants will also be graded on how much income tax they've paid to the state of Nevada, making it necessary for out-of-state players to partner up with well-heeled local businesspeople to get an edge. Derek Peterson is an example of somebody who wasn’t scared away by the rules. A recognizable name in the nation’s burgeoning marijuana industry, the former Morgan Stanley investment banker operates a cooperative cannabis dispensary in Oakland, CA, called Blum, and is also the CEO of Terra Tech, which is a public company selling hydroponic grow equipment. Peterson set up a separate LLC solely for the purpose of applying for licenses in unincorporated Clark County, hoping to run two dispensaries and two grow operations. He hired a lobbyist and an established Las Vegas law firm with experience applying for gaming licenses to put together his 500-page application. His business plan includes a shuttle service to transport people from casinos to his dispensaries. Peterson will find out if he got the licenses he applied for in June, but then must also apply for a permit at the state level. ""Will they do what strip clubs do, where they pay taxi drivers to bring their guys there?"" In general, so-called Sin City is acting conservatively with its first steps into marijuana capitalism. No big flashy signs are permitted, no dispensaries are allowed on the Strip itself (though near the Strip is fine), and businesses can only operate during daylight hours. ""Nevada isn’t what people think on the outside — we have a tolerance for many things, but we move sort of slowly into those things,"" says Joe Brezny, executive director of the Nevada Cannabis Industry Association. ""How will these places advertise? Will they do what strip clubs do, where they pay taxi drivers to bring their guys there? Or are you going to give the hotel concierge an incentive to recommend your club?"" says Lisa Mayo-DeRiso of Mayo & Associates, a Las Vegas consulting firm working with several cannabis business applicants. ""It’s still an unanswered question."" Steve D'Angelo, executive director of Harborside Health Centers (Steve D'Angelo) Steve D’Angelo, a longtime marijuana activist and executive director of the Harborside Health Center medical marijuana dispensaries in Oakland and San Jose, CA, says he believes the cannabis industry in Vegas should take pains to differentiate itself from the casinos, or risk a culture clash. In a white paper he wrote, entitled: ""Opportunity or Peril: The Economic Potential of Cannabis Tourism in Las Vegas,"" D’Angelo advocated for self-contained cannabis-themed resorts, complete with cannabis film festivals and museums, hotel rooms with hemp sheets and in-room vaporizers, and cafes serving salads with organic hemp-seed dressing. The alternative, he writes, is a scenario where patients ""ingest"" cannabis in their hotel rooms, casino bathrooms, public walkways, shows, and nightclubs. ""Wafting smoke and seeping aromas will confront and disturb families and children along with much of the existing adult clientele,"" he writes ominously. In other words, casinos and cannabis, at least in D’Angelo’s opinion, don’t mix. That said, D’Angelo is also throwing his hat in the ring in Nevada — just not in unincorporated Clark County. He says he objects to the county’s stipulation that all its weed must be grown indoors, rather than in more environmentally friendly greenhouses. D’Angelo was cagey about exactly where he’d be applying for a cannabis business license, but says he was excited about the potential of downtown Las Vegas, which Zappos CEO Tony Hsieh has been trying to reengineer into a playground for artists and tech startups. (Downtown Las Vegas is in a different jurisdiction from the Strip. It belongs to the city of Las Vegas, as opposed to the Strip, the Airport, and the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, which belong to unincorporated Clark County.) The city of Las Vegas is expected to begin its licensing process soon. Meanwhile, the rest of the country continues to find Vegas’ vision compelling enough based on past history. The place is less a city than a state of mind — one where you're free to live out your fantasies, including the naughty ones. ""People who love cannabis will come to Las Vegas,"" says D’Angelo. ""We need to create an all-encompassing, immersive cannabis experience, not just be vending little bags of pot.""",0.6848423334740046,0.3151576665259954,0.8567549575279921,1530,5.2281045751633988,751,6.5579227696404789,0,0,"Business, Report",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

As usual, the bulk of the company's money came from smartphone and tablet sales, which were flat-to-down year-over-year, reflecting what Samsung calls ""lower demand due to weak seasonality."" Next quarter, it expects to see only a ""slight increase"" in demand when compared to the corresponding period in 2013. While the market for smartphones appears to be flat, the mobile division is still extremely profitable. Samsung's cash pile increased to almost $60 billion this quarter — that's up from around $43 billion this time last year.   In addition to uninspiring mobile and tablet performance, the company's TV and display panel revenues were both slightly down. The only area that saw meaningful growth is Samsung's semiconductor division. Revenues rose by 9 percent and profits grew a massive 82 percent year-over-year, primarily due to stronger sales of memory. The semiconductor business accounted for 17 percent of Samsung Electronics' overall revenue last quarter. Samsung may rein in its marketing budget The Galaxy S5 launched after the end of this financial quarter, and Samsung took the opportunity to reassure investors that it expects to see the new smartphone outsell its previous flagship, the Galaxy S4.

The electronics giant previously expected to pull in an operating income of 80 billion yen ($782 million) over the financial year, but is today adjusting that figure down to just 26 billion yen ($254 million). The sharp reduction — the new operating income estimates are 68 percent down from a February forecast — can be attributed to a pair of somewhat unexpected events. Roughly 30 billion yen ($293 million) of the drop is due to ""additional expenses"" from Sony's exit from the PC business. The company announced it's to sell its PC division to a Japanese investment fund earlier this year.  Blu-ray is dying faster than expected The second charge is due to what Sony calls ""demand for physical media contracting faster than anticipated,"" especially in Europe. Because of this, Sony says it does not believe the business will generate ""sufficient cash flow in the future to recover the carrying amount of long-lived assets."" It anticipates an impairment charge on those assets, and a second charge on the overall value of its disc manufacturing business, which will amount to 25 billion yen ($245 million). Blu-ray was officially introduced in 2006, backed by Sony and other manufacturers, and briefly battled against competing ""next-generation"" format HD-DVD. Buoyed by widespread adoption thanks to integration with the PlayStation 3, the popularity of Sony's format of choice saw HD-DVDs die without trace. Winning this battle required heavy investment from Sony, an investment that it expected to recoup with years of strong sales. Instead of the market moving from DVD to Blu-ray, consumers began to embrace downloads from Apple's iTunes service and streaming from sites like Netflix and Hulu. Although Blu-ray is integrated with some Windows laptops, it was never offered by Apple — Steve Jobs famously called the format a ""bag of hurt.""  With the rise of movie streaming and downloads, Sony is now accepting that its disc business is not worth as much as it hoped. Sony will give a full rundown of its financial performance over the past year in two weeks.

In an opinion from earlier this month, district court judge William Martini responded to a request by Daniel Gatson, who is accused of running a lucrative jewelry theft ring that was busted by the FBI in 2013. Among many other requests to suppress evidence of cellphone location data, seized physical evidence, and phone conversations, Gatson asked for the court to throw out his social media history: namely, pictures from a private Instagram account, which law enforcement officers had accessed by creating a fake account and friending him. ""No search warrant is required"" to go undercover on Instagram Social media, especially places where people might feel safe enough to post secrets, have become a standard tool for law enforcement. In 2013, the NYPD shut down an illegal gun-selling operation after seeing pictures of weapons and cash on Instagram. Prosecutors have used tweets to show intent in murder charges, and Facebook messages were central to a New York gang raid last year. In some cases, the information was public. In others, though, it was restricted to friends, so police had to either find informants or actively create fake accounts and gain a suspect's trust. This might not be a complicated process: it's not difficult to make someone think you have friends in common. But they're still gaining information under false pretenses, and defendants have sued on those grounds, saying it constituted an invasive search. On a site like Facebook, which requires real names, it would at least violate community standards; Buzzfeed reported on such a case in October. Instagram, though, has much looser standards, and Judge Martini shut the request down quickly. ""No search warrant is required for the consensual sharing of this type of information,"" he wrote. Besides the statement that law enforcement used an ""undercover account"" to become friends with Gatson, there's little information about the move in either this or other court filings. It appears far less important to the case than phone surveillance — police gathered location data to put Gatson near the scene of burglaries and tapped phone conversations between him and other alleged conspirators. We're still figuring out how the law should treat social media, especially when it comes to nebulous online crimes like threats. But Martini was able to refer to a case from 2012 that was similarly favorable to police: a New York district court decision saying that if a Facebook friend is working with the police, it's entirely legal for them to share what you post.",0.5087212818172304,0.4912787181827696,0.8518229107526419,431,5.1554524361948957,275,6.0509090909090908,0,0,"Policy & Law, US & World",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

The case of Garcia v. Google Inc. was considered in an appeals court, in front of a panel of 11 judges. At issue: Innocence of Muslims, the controversial video uploaded to YouTube in 2012. The plaintiff, an actress in the film, argues that she holds a copyright to her performance, and has demanded that Google take the movie down. But Google says that if her lawsuit is taken seriously, then frivolous copyright claims will be used to constrain free speech and debilitate the internet companies that host it. With the court’s decision expected some time next year, both sides are girding for a ruling that could have significant consequences. Cindy Lee Garcia’s role in the 2012 film Desert Warrior was supposed to be minor. After answering a casting call the previous summer, Garcia was paid $500 for what turned out to be five seconds of screen time. But it was hardly a bargain: She was cast for a movie that never materialized. A video that spurred violent protests in almost 20 countries Instead of acting in a ""historical Arabian desert adventure film,"" as she had been promised, Garcia and the Desert Warrior cast had their dialogue redubbed by a producer. The result was a 14-minute, Islamophobic film trailer that came to be known as Innocence of Muslims, which portrayed the Prophet Muhammad as a belligerent, pedophilic dupe. (Garcia was originally cast to play a role as a mother; in the finished film, however, she appears to insinuate that Prophet Muhammad is a child molester.) In September 2012, the video was translated into Arabic and shared on YouTube. The clip’s antagonistic message spurred violent protests in almost 20 countries, including Egypt, Libya, and Tunisia. The uproar over Innocence of Muslims was even initially linked to the killing of US Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens, and has served as a crucial talking point for the Republican Party’s irrational fixation on an Obama-led Benghazi conspiracy. An Egyptian cleric issued a fatwa against every person involved with the film. Fearing for her life, Garcia sought protection in, of all things, copyright law. Garcia sued the film’s producer, Nakoula Basseley Nakoula, as well as YouTube and its parent company, Google, in an attempt to have Innocence of Muslims taken down. While service providers like YouTube aren’t held responsible for the kind of deception that Nakoula engaged in, they are on the hook for misappropriating intellectual property. This helps explain Garcia’s curious legal strategy. A novel interpretation of copyright law To compel YouTube to get rid of the video, and to protect her from the death threats, Garcia had to fashion her possible allegations of libel and fraud into a copyright claim. She argued that her performance amounted to an independent work of authorship, a copyright upon which Google was infringing. The court denied her request. But the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals sided with Garcia, in a 2–1 decision, and ordered Google to take the video down. Concerned with the court’s interpretation of copyright law and the demands it might impose on internet companies, Google asked the Ninth Circuit — whose jurisdiction includes both Hollywood and Silicon Valley — to rehear the case with a full panel of judges. In oral arguments on Monday, Google’s counsel stressed the ramifications of upholding this expansive understanding of copyright. Under the DMCA, copyright holders can urge internet companies to remove illegal content by submitting takedown requests. If, as Garcia argues, one’s performance merits its own copyright claim, a slew of newly legitimate takedown requests might inundate the web’s media platforms. Not only would this jeopardize the viability of smaller film studios and content hosts, it would also restrict free speech. It could invite other claims of copyright that exist solely to suppress information, rather than to protect creative work.   Several judges seemed skeptical of Garcia’s copyright claim. ""Take the battle scenes, for example, in The Lord of the Rings. In your view does every single person who made a cameo in the battle scenes have a copyright interest in their performance as fixed in the film?"" Judge M. Margaret McKeown asked the plaintiff. On the other side, Google’s lawyer was needled incessantly by judge Alex Kozinski, who ruled against Google in the previous appeal. Kozinski challenged Google to show why actors like Garcia shouldn’t hold a copyright in their performances. I spoke to Corynne McSherry, Intellectual Property Director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, who filed a brief joined by the ACLU and others in support of Google. McSherry told me that Garcia’s copyright claim is ultimately unpersuasive. ""A five-second performance responding to the direction of somebody else in a much larger video does not give you a copyright interest in that work,"" McSherry explained. ""Copyright law is vague enough, but not that vague."" ""Copy right law is vague, but not that vague."" McSherry said this issue goes back to the Constitution, which grants Congress power to secure exclusive rights to artists and inventors. Copyright claims have always involved someone doing something creative tied to a tangible work, rather than a minor recital of a line, or something more inchoate. ""There can be circumstances where an actor might exercise sufficient creative control and that person might have a copyright interest,"" McSherry said. ""So it’s not to say that an actor can never have a copyright interest in the work, but this isn’t one of them."" Michael Page, a partner at the law firm Durie Tangri and counsel for Netflix, told me that even if Garcia did enough creative work to be considered a joint author, she would still share authorship with Nakoula, who would be free to post her performance on YouTube. Using Garcia’s theory, Page said, any actor, no matter the insignificance of their role, might be granted unprecedented power over producers, studios, and distributors in a way we’d consider unfair. ""You have a heckler’s veto from anybody in the world who can basically censor the internet by sending a DMCA notice,"" Page said. Garcia might have had an easier way to get the video taken down: Public Citizen filed a brief arguing that she could have sued the producer in state court, arguing fraud and unfair businesses practices. With a court order against Nakoula, she’d be able to petition Google to honor the removal of the wrongful content. Public Citizen believes Google would have complied. (Google temporarily blocked the video in Egypt and Libya out of concerns for violence, and restricted access in other countries including India and Indonesia, where the video violated local laws.) Where Garcia’s opponents see censorship and a tedious meddling with their business model, her allies see a recognition of their work and worth. ""Each actor adds something new to the character she performs … the actor imbues the character with originality,"" the Screen Actors Guild and other entertainment groups argued in a brief. And in this originality, however small, lies a copyright claim. The brief goes on to describe the different actorly interpretations of Batman: how Christian Bale’s Bruce Wayne was different from George Clooney’s. (The brief did not mention the nipples on the batsuit.) Is five seconds on screen enough to deserve a copyright? While Garcia appears only momentarily in Innocence of Muslims, the entertainment groups point out that her script was over five pages. By industry standards, this amounts to about five minutes of screen time, had her full performance been used. Garcia worked for three and a half days, according to court documents. SAG and others contend that the five seconds of screen time is enough to merit a copyright. ""Some of the most memorable film performances are ones that were exceptionally short,"" states the brief. The legal document invites us to consider Clint Eastwood’s Dirty Harry line: ""So you gotta ask yourself this question: ‘Do I feel lucky?’ Well, do ya, punk?’ It asserts that while this scene was part of Eastwood’s larger performance, this particular line was made memorable by the actor. Thus, even fleeting performances — such as Garcia’s — could be separately copyrightable. (I would like to see a short performance where a lawyer from SAG restates this analogy with a straight face.) Google’s opponents believe the company could easily sort through any increase in copyright notices using its sophisticated, automated systems. But it’s not clear that other video hosting platforms have the same capabilities, or whether independent filmmakers will be able to comply with the new rules. It’s hard to imagine the dread that emerges from a flurry of death threats. Or the anxiety of seeing your own image, clumsily edited, mouthing out words you have never spoken. But Garcia wants to use the ownership rights of her performance as a shield. She wishes to harness the power granted to authors as a workaround to coerce Google, to alter a record of history she disputes. The Ninth Circuit shouldn’t use the unfortunate facts of her situation to create a new kind of intellectual property, where extras and bit parts carry the creative status of author. The court may soon cite a dubious copyright to silence protected speech. We should hope they don’t.",0.5504842970026262,0.44951570299737376,0.4961349479802921,1552,5.195876288659794,776,6.4536082474226806,0,2,"Culture, Policy & Law, US & World, Report",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

As the day progressed, the number of theaters playing The Interview grew into the hundreds. Notably, however, no major US theater has joined the list. Last Friday, President Barack Obama told the world that he thought it was a ""mistake"" for Sony to cancel the release of The Interview. Later that same day, the movie studio's CEO, Michael Lynton, defended the company's decision, saying it had no choice but to cancel the film's Christmas release date after all major US theater chains refused to screen the film. He also reiterated in a televised interview that ""we have always had every desire to have the American public to see this movie."" ""We have always had every desire to have the American public to see this movie."" The question, until today, was how Sony would get the movie in front of the public's eyes. In that very same CNN interview on Friday, Lynton said that ""there has not been one major VOD distributor [or] one major e-commerce site that has stepped forward and said they're willing to distribute this movie for us."" He added, ""we don’t have that direct interface with the American public so we need to go through an intermediate."" That statement suggested that Lynton had entirely overlooked Sony's very own Crackle streaming video service, which is home to a number of Sony Pictures films. The FBI has linked North Korea to the massive cyberattack that's crippled Sony Pictures since November 24th. The hacking group, which calls themselves the Guardians of Peace, has released massive amounts of internal Sony data and demanded that the company halt the release of The Interview. During Friday's press conference, Obama said the US ""will respond"" to the North Korean attack on Sony but didn't clarify beyond saying it would be ""proportional."" Following threats of physical violence, all major theaters dropped the movie and Sony later canceled the premiere altogether. According to CNN, the hacking group last emailed Sony on Friday, threatening to release more data unless it (somehow) removes all signs that The Interview ever existed. The film's official Facebook and Twitter pages, along with the clips from Sony Pictures' YouTube channel, did in fact disappear for a few days.

We are  pleased we can now join with our partners to offer the film nation-wide today. We never stopped pursuing as wide a release as possible for The Interview. It was essential for our studio to release this movie, especially given the assault upon our business and our employees by those who wanted to stop free speech. We chose the path of digital distribution first so as to reach as many people as possible on opening day, and we continue to seek other partners and platforms to further expand the release. I want to thank Google and Microsoft for helping make this a reality. This release represents our commitment to our filmmakers and free speech. While we couldn’t have predicted the road this movie traveled to get to this moment, I’m proud our fight was not for nothing and that cyber criminals were not able to silence us. No doubt the issues we have confronted these last few weeks will not end with this release, but we are gratified to have stood together and confident in our future. I want to thank everyone at Sony Pictures for their dedication and perseverance through what has been an extraordinary and difficult time.   President Obama also praised the move: ""Mistake"" no more: @WhiteHouse says the president ""appreciates Sony's work on this effort over the past few weeks"" pic.twitter.com/5GXPQnr08m  As did Microsoft's general counsel Brad Smith: In the United States, freedom of expression is a fundamental principle that is protected by law.

In the 21st Century, there is no more important place for that right to be exercised than on the Internet. After substantial thought, we decided to stand up with Sony and work with others to ensure that freedom of expression triumphs over cyber-terrorism. We of course appreciate that there are varied views regarding this film. That’s true of many works and many issues. We’re not endorsing this movie or any other.

Yesterday, the Colorado District Attorney's office said it had detained 33-year-old Jeremiah Perez, who is accused of transmitting an online threat in retaliation for the death of unarmed 18-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. On December 17th, Google notified the FBI about a Google+ account called ""Vets Hunting Cops,"" which had commented on a YouTube video. The comment said that since Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson fatally shot Brown in August, ""our group"" had killed six retired sheriffs and police officers and would ""hunt two more in Colorado this week."" The account had made similar previous statements, saying that ""we are armed and getting ready for war, cant [sic] wait to kill you fake patriots on the right."" ""We are armed and getting ready for war."" The Colorado FBI tracked the IP address of the post and requested the name associated with it through Perez's ISP. After police got a warrant to search his residence, he allegedly confessed, saying that the post was ""the result of misplaced frustration and a way of experimenting with words ... his intent was to engage YouTube viewers in conversation, but not a single person replied to his postings."" Perez then ""expressed remorse"" for making the threats. While the Google+ post implied that a group of people was hunting police, he allegedly said this was only to lend weight to his words. The FBI says that an investigation of Perez's computer confirmed he made the posts and also showed searches for ""Kill Barack Obama,"" ""Kill Darren Wilson,"" ""Kill Fox News Racist,"" ""Hunt Darren Wilson's Family,"" and ""How to Find Somebody's IP Address Through YouTube."" Ismaaiyl Brinsley, the man who shot two police officers in Brooklyn on Saturday before killing himself, posted his own threats to Instagram shortly before the killings. If convicted, Perez faces up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine.

In a report on the use of slideshows during trials, The Marshall Project points to a number of instances where prosecutors have been reprimanded or convictions have been overturned because of how PowerPoint was used. Basically, PowerPoint seems to be making it far too easy for prosecutors to make ridiculous and inappropriate slideshows — for instance, slathering the word ""guilty"" in big red letters over a defendant's head — thus improperly affecting the outcome of the trial.  GUILTY GUILTY GUILTY GUILTY *SO* GUILTY Covering a defendant's head with the word ""guilty"" is a recurring issue, according to The Marshall Project. But prosecutors have tried all kinds of other effects, including putting the defendant's name or photo in a bullseye and even using sounds and flashing text. This has reportedly led to at least 10 instances over just the last two years of a criminal conviction being reversed because a prosecutor violated fair argument rules with a slideshow.  Slides from New Jersey v. Geraldo Rivera There's nothing strictly new about what the prosecutors are getting into trouble over here — it's more that technology continues to enable flashier and more convincing presentations than many were previously capable of creating, making this an increasingly common problem. The Marshall Project reports that higher courts do seem to be taking issue with presentations like these when they come up, but that prosecutors will likely continue to push the limits of what they can do until the boundaries of PowerPoint presentations are clearer.

This followed a $600,000 settlement case in October, when it was discovered that the employees of Marriott's Gaylord Opryland Hotel & Convention Center were using a jammer to block off internet access. Microsoft laid out its arguments against the petition in the filing, stating that a Wi-Fi hotspot set up by a hotel guest is authorized to operate in the unlicensed spectrum, and pointing out that ""wilfully excluding these other authorized devices from using that unlicensed spectrum, under the guise of mitigating so-called threats to the reliability (performance) of an operator's own network, violates Section 333,"" which bars ""wilful or malicious interference"" to radio signals."" The company also pointed out that by restricting the ability to set up their own connections, Marriott would be forcing the customer to pay to access the hotel's own Wi-Fi, having already paid their mobile operator for the ability to set up a hotspot anywhere. The hotel chain had argued that it wasn't breaking the law, but was protecting its guests from ""rogue wireless hotspots that can cause degraded service, insidious cyber attacks and identity theft."" But Marriott's arguments are weak, as there are several examples that show guests are far safer jumping onto their own personal Wi-Fi hotspots than they are connecting to a potentially compromised hotel Wi-Fi network.

And now on the eve of E3 2015, Bethesda is giving us a real look at the game. More importantly, a release date: November 10th, 2015 for Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and PC. In additional to the regular game, there will be a collector's edition featuring a ""working"" Pip-Boy (provided you use your own mobile device). Fallout 4 starts just before the apocalypse — ""on a beautiful Saturday morning."" This is where you build your character, looking into a bathroom mirror while your significant other looks on (you can choose to play as male or female), and unlike past Fallout games, your character has a voice of his or her own. The majority of game itself, however, takes place 200 years later, and based on what we're seeing, it looks like you can get a dog companion fairly early on.  Howard claims the game — which is confirmed to take place in Boston — will be one of the developer's biggest yet. Fallout 4 is running a new version of the Creation Engine, and the abundance of environmental detail is clear. We didn't see a lot in the way of characters except for the main character (which looked pretty good), and a pre-apocalypse salesman (which didn't). Players will be able to explore the wilderness, complete quests, and visit towns in standard RPG fashion, but Fallout 4 also adds the ability to build your own homestead. Players can scavenge wood, metal, and other materials to build houses, starting out small with shacks, but eventually kitting out their new settlements with color-changing lights, guard towers, stalls for traveling merchants, and sentry guns. The more you build, the more people will move in — and the more likely you will be to attract raiders. World-building is entirely optional, by the way, if you just want to focus on a story.  It's not just buildings you can construct. There are more than 50 base weapons you can build — and 700 different modifications for both weapons and armor. Some of the weapon / armor combinations we saw definitely play up the absurdism more than in the last Fallout (think: Dead Rising).  Over 50 base weapons and over 700 mods. You can even modify your own power armor. #Fallout4 #BE3 pic.twitter.com/Pveaii94on  Some other notable additions: the new in-game Pip-Boy now lets you play ""game tapes"" (think: classic games like Donkey Kong with a Fallout twist) and out in the real world, Bethesda is also releasing an actual Pip-Boy mobile app that you can slot into a physical Pip-Boy (it comes with the Fallout 4 collector's edition, but the app works just fine without it). Bethesda is teasing a lot of ""new"" for the game but says it's trying to avoid spoiling any story details beyond the character-building basics.

Fallout 4 is set in Boston, and it's going to arrive with a renewed (albeit optional) focus on rebuilding the wasteland. And a dog. But there were other reasons to tune into tonight's press conference. And they primarily involved demons, chainsaws, swords, magic, and taking care of tiny people in a vault.   Was there ever any doubt that the new Doom was going to be ridiculously gory? Bethesda made an effort to balance the game's new graphics (it's the first game on the idTech 6 engine) with old-school touches, which effectively means more detailed, quasi-realistic ways to tear inhuman flesh apart with old standby weapons like the chainsaw and super shotgun. True to Doom's history, there's also a multiplayer component, but that was much scarcer during the event. The original Doom's level creation tools helped establish the tradition of modding, where a lot of budding game designers still learn their craft. Bethesda as a whole has one of the most vibrant modding scenes, particularly in its fantasy RPG Skyrim. The latest installment of Doom is trying to continue this tradition: it will include a simple system called Snapmap, where players can create and share their own arenas. Perhaps most notably, it's cross-platform, available for PC, Xbox, and PlayStation. We can't be absolutely positive that The Elder Scrolls Legends will be Bethesda's take on Hearthstone. But all we've seen of it is a distinctly Hearthstone-tinged trailer, and it's a free-to-play strategy card game based on a fantasy video game. There's a pretty good chance. Either way, it's coming to PC and iPad at some point this year. The 2012 Dishonored was a relatively rare piece of ""new IP"" (i.e. a new franchise) amid long-standing Bethesda-published series like Doom and Fallout, but there was little doubt it would get a sequel. Besides the fact that Dishonored 2 exists (though we don't know when it's coming out), the biggest news at this year's E3 is that you'll be able to switch between playing as two characters, original Dishonored protagonist Corvo Attano and his ward Emily Kaldwin. The long-awaited Fallout 4 was officially announced in the lead-up to E3. Today, Bethesda showed us a little bit more of the game — crafting is a big deal, and in a major change, you'll actually spend a little bit of time before the apocalypse. It also gave us a fairly close launch date: November 10th. That's not too long to wait for your full-sized real-life Pip-Boy. It's called Fallout Shelter, and it's pretty cute. You're the overseer of your own post-apocalyptic vault, responsible for keeping its inhabitants happy and reproductively successful. Given that it's essentially advertising for a full-cost AAA title, Bethesda can avoid the paywalls that plague some free-to-play games. Chris Plante calls this a cross between SimTower and XCOM: Enemy Unknown, but I'd rather think of it as Neko Atsume with vault-dwellers instead of cats.

For $300, you got a well-made, nice-looking phone with cutting-edge hardware and few compromises to be found (assuming its 5.5-inch size didn’t put you off). The just-announced, heavily-leaked OnePlus 2 doesn’t deviate strongly from the formula that made the One such an intriguing phone, but there are some notable differences to be found once you dig into the new device. From a specs perspective, the OnePlus 2 features a 5.5-inch, 1080p screen, a Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 processor, and either 16GB of storage with 3GB of RAM or 64GB of storage with 4GB of RAM. The back-facing camera has a 13-megapixel sensor with optical image stabilization, while the front camera lets you shoot selfies at 5 megapixels. That back camera also includes a two-tone flash and a laser focusing system. While most of these specs are pretty standard fare for a high-end smartphone, the price remains anything but: the 16GB model will retail for $329, while the 64GB version will go for $389. That’s more than last year’s model, but after spending some time with the phone, I feel like the price increase is justified for what you get.    On the surface, the OnePlus 2 is very similar to its predecessor. It’s still the same 5.5-inch device, but the body material is significantly nicer this time — most of the frame is made of aluminum, but the back keeps the textured, grippy material featured on last year’s phone. That back is easier to replace this time; OnePlus showed me a handful of new backs including two wooden options and a kevlar back that brings to mind Verizon’s never-ending parade of Droids. The combo of the unusual textured back with the shiny metal frame looked great to me, and the Moto X-like contour of the phone meant that it nestled into my hand and felt a bit smaller than such a large phone should feel. There are a few other hardware tricks you’ll see on this phone that you won’t find on most other devices, perhaps most importantly the USB-C connector on the bottom. We knew this would be the case, but it’s still nice to see a company moving people over to the new port as soon as possible. There’s also a three-position switch on the side of the phone that lets you cycle through the three default notification settings in Android Lollipop (all, priority, and none). I use an iPhone pretty frequently and am very used to using the side switch to silence sounds, so having a more granular hardware switch on the OnePlus 2 is a very welcome addition. Thoughtful software and hardware tweaks abound Another new addition is the front-facing fingerprint unlock sensor, and it does indeed work as advertised. With the phone locked, it only took barely a second of laying my finger on the sensor to get the phone open and ready for use. Much like the iPhone, you have to back up the fingerprint sensor with a traditional on-screen lock, but whatever sensor and software OnePlus are using here seem like a very reliable combo. Once you’ve unlocked the phone, you’ll see the very familiar stylings of Android 5.1 — but this time, OnePlus has added its own in-house software (called OxygenOS) over the top, rather than using Cyanogenmod as it did last year. Fortunately, it’s a very clean skin, with minimal extra features — there are some new options included in the settings, like a menu that lets you enable gestures to tap the screen to wake it, or draw a circle on the screen to launch the camera. You'll have to go through the notorious OnePlus invite system again, but the phones will at least ship faster this time But the biggest addition is something OnePlus calls the ""shelf."" When you swipe to the left from your home screen, you’ll see an area that collects your favorite contacts and most used apps (Google Now can still be accessed by long-pressing on the home button). OnePlus says it’ll extend the functionality of the shelf over time, but right now it doesn’t really do much worth noting. Hopefully that’ll change by the time this phone gets into consumers’ hands, because right now I’d rather just have Google Now in its default spot. By and large, though, OnePlus’ software implementation is graceful and minimalist, with thoughtful additions like the ability to swap between on-screen navigation buttons versus using the capacitive buttons below the screen. OnePlus also included its own camera software, which is fast and minimalist; we’ll have to wait until we get to spend more time with the phone to judge the picture quality. Unfortunately, just like last year, the OnePlus 2 will be available online through an ""invite"" system — you’ll only be able to preorder it if you get an invite. The good news is that getting an invite will hopefully be easier this time around, as anyone can sign up to receive one on the OnePlus website (among other places, like OnePlus's social media accounts). There’s no telling how long it’ll take to get an invite once you've signed up, but OnePlus knows it needs to move faster than it did last year: the phone will start shipping to the US, Europe, and India by the middle of August.",0.6349512273643859,0.3650487726356141,0.17956214973734538,910,4.7956043956043954,465,5.9483870967741934,0,18,"Google, Mobile, Tech, Hands-on, Photo Essay",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Recode reports that the startup now plans on designing its own smartphone. Though details are thin, the device will presumably showcase the company's unique take on cloud storage. More information is promised for the coming weeks. NextBit, which is run by alums from Google, Apple, HTC, and Amazon, initially unveiled its app transfer software late last year. Called Baton, the software allows the user to save their state in whatever app they're using, and share that data to other Baton-ready device. Then, via a NextBit account, the same app can be opened on another device in the exact same spot. The one caveat is NextBit requires manufacturers to build Baton into their devices instead of allowing users to download it. The company thus partnered with CyanogenMod to release the tool at launch as a way of making it available. ""We don't have to be for everybody."" Making a phone of its own might put NextBit in a position to get its vision more exposure.

HelloMotoHK has published what it claims to be accurate hardware specs for the device, and those point to the 2015 Moto X having a 1080p screen — just like last year's. This display will be larger, however, coming in at 5.5 inches. That puts it on par with the LG G4 (which has a much sharper 2560 x 1440 resolution) and Apple's iPhone 6 Plus. If accurate, the new Moto X will be larger than the Samsung Galaxy S6 and HTC One M9, though still falls short of the biggest phablets like Samsung's Galaxy Note and Motorola's own Nexus 6. Sticking with 1080p could mean better battery life So the screen resolution may disappoint some, but if true, Motorola is likely sticking with 1080p for an important reason: battery life. The new Moto X is rumored to contain a 3,600mAh battery, which should be more than enough to carry it through an entire day of usage. Motorola has apparently chosen Qualcomm's Snapdragon 808 processor — a great performer in the LG G4 — to power its latest flagship. That should also help keep it running longer, since the 808 isn't quite as juice-hungry as the Snapdragon 810. HelloMotoHK is also saying that the new Moto X will include support for microSD cards, which is something we've seen in Motorola's less expensive handsets. And the camera reportedly uses a 21-megapixel sensor (which could mean it's borrowed from the Droid Turbo), with a 5-megapixel front-facing cam. That's a bit less exciting to hear, since Samsung and LG have both recently shown the sweet spot for 2015 Android flagships is 16 megapixels. But who knows what optimizations and improvements Motorola has made to its camera, one of the lone weaknesses of its last Moto X.

It's an important step toward reducing the thirst of the trigger-happiest users.   Mute is part of a broader update to the iOS app that also lets you update your language preferences so that broadcasts in your global list of recent broadcasts are in a language you actually speak. (By default, Periscope will use whichever language you have chosen in your device's settings.)

In its biennial Living Planet Report, the WWF finds that the largest declines have occurred in tropical and low-income regions, where biodiversity has suffered due to increasing resource demands from high-income countries. ""We're gradually destroying our planet’s ability to support our way of life,"" Carter Roberts, WWF president and CEO, said in a statement Tuesday. ""But we already have the knowledge and tools to avoid the worst predictions. We all live on a finite planet and it's time we started acting within those limits."" ""We need leadership for change."" The group's Living Planet Index — a representative sample of more than 10,000 populations of birds, mammals, reptiles, and fish — decreased by 52 percent between 1970 and 2010. That marks a far greater decline than previously believed, partly due to more available data. The WWF's previous Living Planet Report, released in 2012, found that the index declined by 28 percent between 1970 and 2008. Freshwater species saw the steepest decline between 1970 and 2010, dropping by 76 percent, followed by marine and terrestrial species, which both fell by 39 percent. Much of this decline has been driven by unrelenting demand for natural resources, which destroys natural habitats and ecosystems, and has been compounded by climate change. The report also measures each country's ""ecological footprint,"" which highlights regional differences in resource use. Kuwait was found to have the largest ecological footprint per capita, followed by Qatar. The US has the eighth largest per-capita footprint, but is second only to China in the aggregate. India, Indonesia, and some other low-income countries have sustainable per capita ecological footprints, but the world as a whole would still require 1.5 Earths to sustain its current resource consumption. ""If all people on the planet had the footprint of the average resident of Qatar, we would need 4.8 planets,"" the WWF said. ""If we lived the lifestyle of a typical resident of the USA, we would need 3.9 planets."" The outlook is certainly grim, but the WWF says there's still a chance to reverse course if businesses and politicians make conservation a priority. ""We need leadership for change,"" Marco Lambertini, director general of WWF International, wrote in the foreword to the report. ""Sitting on the bench waiting for someone else to make the first move doesn’t work.

Their results are published in the journal Nature.  Life as we understand it requires liquid water Astronomers figure out what elements compose an exoplanet by studying how light from the planet's star is absorbed as the planet passes in front of it. Until now, Neptune-sized and smaller planets hadn't been possible to study, probably because of heavy cloud cover. When HAT-P-11b passed in front of its host star, in the constellation Cygnus, it showed clearly the planet had water vapor. This bodes well for the search for life elsewhere in the galaxy. Life as we understand it requires liquid water, carbon-based molecules, and an energy source; in the case of humans, that energy source is the sun. We know life can survive on an Earth-sized planet in the habitable zone: we're proof. Now, if we can detect water vapor on similar planets, we may have a better bead on where to look for other kinds of life.   Of course, a Neptune-sized planet is still about four times larger than Earth. But this discovery, made using instrumentation on the Hubble Space Telescope, bodes well for Hubble's successor, the James Webb Space Telescope, which is due to be launched in 2018.

In its manifesto, the Society declares that  “we believe that clouds are unjustly maligned and that life would be immeasurably poorer without them.” A decade on, the organization boasts a lively online community, over 56,000 Facebook followers, and tens of thousands of members across almost 100 countries around the world.  One of the Cloud Appreciation Society website’s most popular features is an expansive photo gallery where anyone can submit, say, an altocumulus floccus gracing the sky over Cabbagehall, Fife, Scotland, a wispy cirrus formation over Nova Scotia, Canada, or a menacing thunderstorm over Maryville, Tennessee. The section takes itself as seriously as the rest of the organization, which is to say not very — one of the major branches of the gallery is dedicated to ""clouds that look like things,"" which includes seahorses, ghosts, cyclists, and at least one pterodactyl. The majority of the clouds on display are easily recognizable varieties: featherlike cirrus clouds and big, photogenic cumulus clouds. But soon after launching the site, Pretor-Pinney received a couple pictures that didn’t quite fit into existing classifications. One image, taken from the 12th floor of an office building in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, looked positively apocalyptic — a violent and undulating thing menacing the city skyline. ""They struck me as being rather different from the normal undulates clouds,"" Pretor-Pinney says, referring to clouds with a wave-like formation. ""They were more turbulent, more confused — as if you were underneath the water looking up toward the surface when the sea is particularly disturbed and chaotic."" Every six months or so, Pretor-Pinney says, a similar photo would come into his mailbox. In time, he came to wonder if there was a case to be made for a brand-new cloud type — the first addition to the cloud classification system in half a century. Credit: Louisa Price, Location: Colchester, Essex, UK In the winter of 1803, a British pharmacist named Luke Howard presented a paper titled ""On The Modification of Clouds,"" in which he set out four primary cloud classifications: the fuzzy cirrus, the popcorn-like cumulus, the expansive stratus, and the water-logged Nimbus. Over the next century, those terms were honed and expanded on and by the late 19th century, multiple ""cloud atlases"" had emerged in hopes of codifying nature’s most ephemeral element. But all these were superseded by the mammoth International Cloud Atlas, published in 1896, which quickly became the global standard for cloud identification. The Cloud Atlas cemented into place four levels of classification. In order from most to least important, these are genre, species, varieties, and lastly, supplementary features and accessory clouds. Numerous editions of the International Cloud Atlas (now overseen by the World Meteorological Organization) have been published over the decades, though the pace has slowed down drastically as fewer and fewer adjustments need to be made. The last edition was published in 1975, and with its colorful plates it is a beautiful and much sought-after commodity — copies can go for thousands of dollars. If Pretor-Pinney’s new cloud had any hope of finding any legitimacy in the world, it would have to find a way into the pages of the International Cloud Atlas. Fortunately, the World Meteorological Organization is currently in the process of preparing the first new edition of The International Cloud Atlas in four decades. Finally, the Atlas will be available online — the clouds are coming to the cloud. Credit: Gary McArthur, Location: Burnie, Tasmania, Australia To name is to conjure into existence, so before Pretor-Pinney could propose a new cloud variation, he called a cousin, a latin teacher, who suggested the verb aspero, used by Virgil to describe a roughened sea. The churning clouds in Pretor-Pinney’s photos now had a name: undulatus asperatus. Pretor-Pinney took his cloud to England’s Royal Meteorological Society who suggested he needed scientific justification for the creation of a new cloud type. So the cloud enthusiast visited the University of Reading, where a graduate student adopted the undulatus asperatus as the subject of his final paper. In 2010, Graeme Anderson published a lengthy dissertation, ""Asperatus: the Application of Cloud Classification to a Suggested New Cloud Type"" in which he concluded that indeed, ""there is a case for defining these formations as a new supplementary feature."" Tweaking the existing Cloud Atlas — either by adding or removing variations — is not a decision taken lightly. ""We don’t want to make changes; it’s a standard,"" says Dr. Roger Atkinson of the World Meteorological Organization. ""If a standard has been properly done and well written out, it should stand the test of time and place."" Accurately identifying and observing clouds can help meteorologists fine-tune weather forecasts, better understand regional ecology and even diagnose larger shifts in the global climate. A change in definitions can have a significant and lasting impact on how, and what, gets measured. Change the name of cloud A to cloud B, and overnight all the cloud As of the world vanish into thin air. Credit: Elaine Patrick, Location: Newtonia Missouri But there comes a point, Dr. Atkinsons says, when the benefits of including a new classification become greater than the costs of excluding it. The WMO assigned a task team to identify the needs of a new edition of the International Cloud Atlas and one of their responsibilities was establishing the legitimacy of undulatus asperatus — among a few other new varieties. In November 2013, that task team formulated a definition of the asperatus cloud: ""A formation made up of well-defined, wavelike structures in the underside of the cloud, more chaotic and with less horizontal organization than undulatus. Asperatus is characterised by localized waves in the cloud base, either smooth or dappled with smaller features, sometimes descending into sharp points, as if viewing a roughened sea surface from below. Varying levels of illumination and thickness of cloud can lead to dramatic visual effects."" The task team also recommended that the asperatus be included in the forthcoming edition of the International Cloud Atlas, though the ultimate decision lies with the WMO’s larger commission body. The chances of Pretor-Pinney’s cloud coming to life, says Dr. Atkinson, is ""very high, but we cannot be certain."" ""Whether it’s going to be called asperatus is another matter,"" says Dr. Atkinson. ""We need to receive advice from a proper latin scholar."" ""If there is a better latin term, of course, I’m all ears,"" says Pretor-Pinney. For the cloud connoisseur the inclusion of the asperatus into the International Cloud Atlas would be a crowning accomplishment of what he terms ""the democratization of science observation enabled by the internet."" But more than that, it would give the public a reason to look up. ""By naming things around us, it focuses our attention,"" he says. ""When you know the names of different butterflies, you start to seeing them and paying attention to them. It’s the same with clouds. The motivation is to keep people engaged with the sky — paying attention to clouds and thinking of them as a beautiful and fascinating part of our surroundings.""

Hobaiter, a chimpanzee researcher at the University of St. Andrews in the UK, told fellow primatologist Thibaud Gruber that she had witnessed a group of chimps using a mix of moss and leaves to soak up drinking water from a watering hole in the forest. In 20 years of research, no one had observed this behavior in this community of chimps, and yet Hobaiter had managed to capture the behavior on video — numerous times. ""When she told me that she had all the videos on her laptop and, most importantly, that we could probably extract from these videos all the information necessary to document the spread of the behavior within the community,"" Gruber says in an email to The Verge, ""I knew we were in business!"" ""The chimpanzees just decided to display this novel behavior right in front of us."" Chimpanzees are widely considered the most ""cultural"" of all non-human animals, Gruber says. Their ability to use tools is well-known, and their capacity to transmit those behaviors socially has garnered a lot of attention in recent years. Until now, though, observations of chimps learning to use tools from each other had only taken place in captivity — a setting that, necessarily, doesn't resemble the wild. Captivity had limited the ecological validity of the earlier findings, says Gruber, who works at the University of Neuchâtel in Switzerland. ""This has been a major point in the animal culture debate for the last 25 years,"" he explains, ""with critics pointing out that there was no evidence so far that any of the presumed cultural behavior found in wild chimpanzees, were in fact socially learnt."" As a result, some scientists think that ""chimp culture"" has nothing to do with the social transmission of culture in humans. But that might soon change. Thanks to Hobaiter’s videos, researchers have been given a rare look at wild chimp society — one that, for the first time, shows the spread of a cultural behavior in the wild. In the study, published today in PLOS Biology, Gruber and his team investigated how two new variations of ""leaf-sponge"" use spreads across a population. These single-use tools are usually the result of a chimp folding leaves into its mouth and subsequently using it to drink, or even to collect honey in experimental conditions. But Hobaiter’s footage showed that some chimps reuse their sponges, whereas others make them by mixing moss into the leaves. ""The chimpanzees just decided to display this novel behavior right in front of us,"" Gruber says, ""and we only needed our camcorders to capture the scenes."" With the footage in hand, the researchers gathered data and ran statistical models. The goal was to see if these novel behaviors were socially transmitted from chimp to chimp. And, according to their results, moss-sponging was a product of social learning among the chimp population. Leaf-sponge reuse, on the other hand, wasn't. What's more, every time an individual sees another chimpanzee perform a behavior, that first chimp is 15 times more likely to develop the behavior, the research showed. ""Most interestingly,"" Gruber says, ""the spread of the behavior was very fast, with seven individuals acquiring the novel behavior in only six days."" This shows that chimpanzees can adopt new tools very quickly. Critics think it's ""just a bunch of anecdotes."" Due to the study’s observational nature, some researchers might object to the findings, Gruber says. ""Many critics continue to think that what we collect in the field is a bunch of anecdotes, and like to claim that 'the plural of anecdotes’ isn’t data."" But Gruber, who mostly focuses on experimental work, thinks that there’s value in collecting observational data in the field. It’s ""highly frustrating"" when people universally suggest otherwise, he says, even if you’ve collected ""over 1,000 instances of the same behavior."" Still, some researchers have embraced the results. Shinya Yamamoto, a primatologist at Kobe University in Japan, told The Verge that the study’s results provide sound evidence of tool-use transmission. ""We are now almost sure that chimpanzees have socially transmitted culture,"" he says. Yamamoto’s own work also focused on social learning and tool-use in chimps, but his experiments took place in a lab. ""This is the start point of further investigation of what are similar and different between human and chimpanzee cultures — to know the basis of technology would be helpful to know the future of our technological societies."" human ancestors likely learned cultural behaviors from each other Along those lines, Gruber thinks the findings strongly support the idea that the last common ancestors of chimps and humans could have learned cultural behaviors from each other. Moreover, chimps appear to build upon old knowledge ""little by little,"" Gruber says, so it’s also likely that ""little changes in cultural knowledge — in contrast to big qualitative jumps — characterized early hominin species."" But before he can dive further into the possible implications for human evolution, researchers will have to address the specific mechanisms that allow for the transmission of chimpanzee culture. ""Unless we do that, there will always be questions about whether the two phenomena are really comparable."" Unfortunately, figuring out just how ""chimp culture"" works will take time — time that chimpanzees might not have. Like many forests in Africa, the Budongo Forest is under constant threat from deforestation. So ""it is great to have finally this evidence of social learning in wild chimpanzees, but it will be to no use if chimpanzees disappear in the wild in the next 50 years,"" Gruber says. That’s why ""it’s of utmost importance to conserve chimpanzees, for themselves, for their cultural knowledge, and for all the still unknown information that they can give us about our past.""",0.5963763988411096,0.4036236011588904,0.847226386213837,981,5.1977573904179408,500,6.266,0,0,"Science, Report",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The US government made history on September 18th when President Obama signed an executive order establishing a task force to combat antibiotic resistance at the federal level. The order outlined general goals such as tracking the use of antibiotics and creating incentives for drug development. Some applauded the announcement, while pointing out other countries’ continued failure to do the same.  Antibiotic resistance is one of the greatest threats to humans worldwide, according to the Infectious Diseases Society of America, a professional group of disease specialists. It costs the US health-care system over $21 billion each year to treat resistant infections. Those treatments aren’t always successful, though: antibiotic resistance claims about 23,000 lives in the US each year, from its more than 2 million annual illnesses across the country.  But even though America has taken some steps to help curb superbugs, infectious disease researchers and doctors just don’t think the government’s strategy is enough. That’s because it doesn’t take into account some major consumers of antibiotics: farm animals. Approximately 80 percent of antibiotics are used on animals, not humans. ""There’s not the same    control or restriction on their use as there is in people,"" says    Stuart Levy, a microbiologist at Tufts University who has spoken out    against the overuse of antibiotics for 30 years. And some of the drugs    used on animals are medically important for humans. So  when   they’re overused in animals, we humans end up with bacterial   infections  that our drugs can’t treat. Resistance occurs when bacteria encounter antibiotics in their    environment in doses too small to kill them. This allows them to adapt    to the drugs in ways that help them resist to larger doses in the    future. And although many emerge from human antibiotic use (about 50 percent of people who take antibiotics don’t actually need them), it’s thought that the    large quantities of antibiotics given to livestock for disease    prevention, treatment, and growth purposes leads to people ingesting bacteria that doesn’t respond to antibiotics. That’s why some epidemiologists    and infectious disease experts are stung that the agricultural uses of    antibiotics didn’t receive more attention in the bill. Obama’s  plan largely glossed over the use of antibiotics in  agriculture.  Besides banning their use for growth purposes — something  the FDA had  already announced it would do in December 2013 — it doesn’t address the preventative use loopholes that remain. ""I   think it’s a step in the right direction,"" Levy says, ""but we wanted a   leap."" Other scientists were more blunt in voicing their discontent. ""It  reads as if it had been written by someone either from the meat  industry, or the vet drug industry,"" says James Johnson, an infectious  disease researcher at the University of Minnesota. Although the  government’s strategy bans the use of antibiotics for growth purposes,  Johnson says, one could easily continue to use them for that purpose,  and call it a preventative measure. ""The language is the standard party  line about how antibiotic use in animals makes stronger animals — that  it’s all wonderful. But that’s just one perspective, and I don’t think  it’s a science-based perspective.""  Not everyone is of this opinion, however. Christine Hoang, assistant director of scientific activities at the American Veterinary Medicine Association, says the goals outlined by the Obama administration are good enough. They reflect the FDA’s stance on antibiotics use in food production and the intention to phase out growth promotion uses, she says. ""There aren't really any loopholes,"" Hoang says. Under Obama’s plan, drugs will be used to treat and prevent disease, she says, and there will be more veterinary oversight. ""I don't think we should limit antibiotic use any more. It's a great detriment to us as a profession, as well as to animal welfare, to restrict them further."" Hoang’s take was echoed by Paula Cray, microbiologist at North Carolina State University and former leader of the USDA’s Bacterial Epidemiology and Antimicrobial Resistance Research Unit, who added that the planet will be home to 4 billion additional humans by 2100, all of which will expect to be fed. ""There’s a need to double the production of animal protein,"" she says. And that kind of production — the kind that presumes that every human will want to eat meat — will take a certain capacity, one that may not be compatible with less crowded animal housing practices. This might very well be the thought process behind the US antibiotic plan. Instead of trying to change farming practices — which guarantees a painful fight with large agricultural corporations — the government has opted to push for the development of new drugs, ones that will be used on either humans or animals, but not both. Accordingly, the US has promised to support basic research and ""leverage existing partnerships"" that will help reduce the obstacles that pharmaceutical companies face during clinical trials. The White House also pledged to inject drug research with an additional $800 million a year to develop new medicines. That may not be enough. ""I’m   not sure that the incentive part will get the pipeline full,"" says   Henry Chambers, chair of the Antimicrobial Resistance Committee at the   Infectious Diseases Society of America. Developing a new drug costs about $5 billion. When companies make that kind of an   investment, it’s because they expect sales numbers for the drug to be   high enough to turn a profit. But when doctors encounter a new   antibiotic, their instinctive reaction is to use it sparingly, so they   have it on a rainy day. ""The   first inclination is to say, ‘Wow this is really good, we better not  use  it because resistance will occur,'"" Chambers says. Besides, new   antibiotics might not be better than the old ones, he says. And some,   such as ciproflaxin and daptomycin,   may have serious side-effects. Doctors who choose new antibiotics therefore end up making their patients purchase drugs that are probably   just as effective, but far more expensive. When you look at it that way, Chambers says, the incentive for doctors to   use new drugs isn’t all that high. And without doctors pushing the drugs out to patients, drug companies aren’t as likely to profit off their $5 billion investment. For many companies, even the government  incentives  don’t make antibiotics as appealing as blood-pressure pills  and cancer  medications.   The US can’t fight off superbugs alone, of course. Countries need to talk to each other when they encounter new health-care challenges, or when they find solutions. The sooner scientists and policy-makers know about new resistance, the easier it is to slow the organisms’ spread. Right now, there’s no fast way to do that, Cray says. Also crucial are better diagnostics. Remember the 50 percent of people who take antibiotics and don’t need them? Cray, Levy, and Johnson all say that aiming antibiotics only at people who need them is key. To do that, faster tests may be needed to separate people who really require antibiotic treatment from those who don’t. Right now, doctors don’t always determine whether something is a bacterial infection before prescribing antibiotics, if they test at all. ""With our current tests, even if they’re done, many take several days and by then people have already taken antibiotics,"" Johnson says. Quicker tests are starting to trickle down to physicians, he says, but they rarely come cheap. Finding ways to accelerate test development — and lower prices — could do a lot more than finding novel antibiotics. But Obama’s plan only provides $20 million for the development of a rapid diagnostic tests, a small sum when compared to the $800 million going to drug development. Since antibiotics were discovered in 1942, we’ve wasted a lot of them, Grayson says. ""If you were an alien standing on Mars, and looking down on the Earth — on humans —  you would say, ‘What an idiotic species!’"" So it’s good that the president is doing something, even if it isn’t as comprehensive as experts at hoped. At least it’s a start, Grayson says. Of course, one of the most important steps to take in curbing antibiotic resistance remains the one that has evaded us for over 70 years: education. Teaching the public about proper antibiotic use ""really has to be developed,"" Cray says. Even basic levels of public education on antibiotic use are lacking. For instance, says Cray, lots of people still think antibiotics will help them get over a cold. That’s wrong, since colds are caused by viruses, not bacteria. The real preventive strategy for viral infections is usually a vaccine, but lots of people go to doctors and ask for antibiotics anyway; sometimes doctors even prescribe them. That contributes to antibiotic resistance too. ""I don’t think everyone needs a deep understanding, but we should have some idea of how things work,"" she says.",0.5939293475518157,0.4060706524481843,0.7575248964205348,1575,4.9168253968253968,691,6.4905933429811871,0,8,"Science, US & World, Features",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Leveraging Google tools to tell better stories In a blog post outlining the goals for the News Lab, Google explains that it wants to collaborate with journalists and entrepreneurs to help map out the future of media. To that end, the company has created a destination for reporters to better leverage Google products in their work. While that doesn't mean designing new products per se, it does mean identifying best practices for newsrooms using apps like Maps, Search, YouTube, and Trends to better track stories in real time, tell stories using data, and distribute them on Google channels. In addition, the company is already working on partnerships with newsrooms to work on specific data projects, while also partnering with media startups like Matter and Hacks/Hackers to develop new ideas and tools for next-gen journalists. All this signals that Google, like a number of its competitors, views media and journalism as an industry to invest resources in. After all, developing a clear focus on quality news means attracting more users — and advertisers — to its services. Facebook already launched its Newswire tool last year, aimed expressly at journalists, and debuted ""instant articles"" last month to strengthen its dominance in news distribution. Meanwhile, Snapchat recently snapped up CNN's Peter Hamby to head up its nascent news division.

The parades have all stopped and the confetti that fell to Earth has been swept aside. I awake at 6:15am to news that Taylor Swift has toppled Apple Music. My oldest, the teenager, the boy whose gift to me was a drawing of a giant robot handing me a flower — he’s still fast asleep. But at 6:45am I begin singing the usual wakeup song: good morning to you, good morning to you, you smell like a monkey, you look like one too. He struggles to sit up and hug me — after 14 years of primate insults he knows I won’t quit singing until he’s upright. I kiss his forehead and return to my laptop. 30 minutes later I do it again. Good morning to you, good morning… repeating the same verses for my 12-year-old son, the one who drew “Happy Father’s Day” in block graffiti letters with mustaches replacing the horizontal lines of each “H.”   My daughter, the youngest, the one whose Father’s Day gift was to read me a story because she knows how proud I am that she’s reading books two years beyond “normal,” is already awake from the commotion. She deftly climbs into my lap, snaking her way between my arms already stretched out to the keyboard in front of me. I withdraw my hands and embrace. These are the three best moments of every day and they arrive without any fanfare, #branded tweets, or help from Hallmark. It’s the time when familial love resets. The time when nobody is arguing. Nobody has yet to skin a knee and nobody is late for dinner. It’s the time I’m reminded of just how fragile my “babies” can be and how important being a dad is — despite the memes poking fun at the role. It’s the day after Father’s Day and I’m just papa again, one of millions but also irreplaceable in the three young lives I must steward into this world — and that’s no joke. After being publicly smacked down by music's biggest star, Apple is changing its tune. Late Sunday night, Apple VP Eddy Cue responded to the open letter that Taylor Swift posted earlier in the day, revealing that Apple now plans to pay artists, labels, and publishers for streams during Apple Music's three-month free trial. The premium streaming service is due to launch on June 30th. Stewart Butterfield, the co-founder of both Slack and Flickr, has condemned the The Wall Street Journal on Twitter for an editorial it published after the Charleston shooting. The WSJ described the massacre as ""a problem that defies explanation"" and claimed that ""the system and philosophy of institutionalized racism identified by Dr. King no longer exists."" Butterfield responded: ""Pretending it doesn't exist is, cognitively, really hard work. And it is dishonest and unfair and cruel work too. It's its own violence."" Back in 2009, Russian design house Art Lebedev introduced the dramatically titled Transparentius concept for improving road safety. It was remarkably simple: put a camera on the front of large, slow-moving trucks and connect it to video displays on the back, thereby informing trailing drivers whether it's safe to overtake the big rig. That's the exact same idea that Samsung is now pursuing with a new prototype truck. YouTube might never be dethroned as the king of online video, but Microsoft has just made a compelling case for visiting Bing before you watch anything on YouTube.  Microsoft gave a much-needed makeover to its Bing video search feature this week, and the final product is pretty good. It features larger, easier-to-identify video thumbnails, and you can even preview videos straight from the results to get an idea of what you're looking at. Just hover your cursor over a result to watch a small bit of the video. The pricing means that Sony's new models won't be competing with the likes of Vizio for the entry-level 4K TV market, but the company said earlier this year that it was confident its Ultra HD TVs stood above their rivals. In The Verge's own experience with the X-series at CES this year, Sony's X series offer inky blacks, impressively bright colors, and OLED-rivaling contrast, on a 0.2-inch screen that's probably thinner than the smartphone in your pocket.

Some of these protesters identify with The Counterforce, while other fragmented supporters agreeing with the group have sprouted in Seattle.

That's a big improvement over the same quarter last year, when it reported $1.45 billion in revenues and $373 million in profit. That means in the last year revenue was up 72 percent and profit roughly tripled. One of the numbers that really stood out was how much Facebook makes per user. In the US and Canada Facebook now makes $5.18 in annual advertising revenue per user. That's an increase of over 80 percent from one year ago. After the raw financials, an important metric investors watch with Facebook is the number of active users, both on desktop and mobile. The company reported 1.28 billion monthly active users and over 1 billion monthly active mobile users. This time last year Facebook had 1.1 billion active monthly users and 751 million monthly mobile users, an increase of 34 percent. It was the first time it had over 1 billion mobile users in a single month. 1.28 billion monthly active users and over 1 billion monthly active mobile users One of the big knocks on Facebook as it prepared for its IPO was that its business was still focused on the desktop while its users were migrating to mobile. The company has turned things around since then, and last quarter reported that more than half its revenue came from mobile ads. This quarter it made 59 percent of its advertising revenue on mobile, compared to around 30 percent one year ago. On the mobile front, Facebook paid a whopping $19 billion for WhatsApp this quarter. During today's earnings call Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that he thought ""WhatsApp could be as ubiquitous as Facebook one day."" At the same time he noted that there were no plans to monetize this acquisition yet by opening it up to advertising, but instead to focus on getting it to a billion users. He also said it doesn't cannibalize Facebook's existing user base. ""WhatsApp and messenger are growing independently because they have different use cases,"" said Zuckerberg. ""WhatsApp could be as ubiquitous as Facebook one day."" Not everyone was excited about today's Facebook earnings. Nate Elliot at Forrester Research said that, ""Today was most notable for what Facebook didn't say: They didn't given an update on teen usage, they didn't announce video ads, and they didn't announce a mobile ad network."" The company also announced David Ebersman, its chief financial officer, will be stepping down. Ebersman helped guide the company through its troubled IPO and its recent strong showing over its first few quarters as a public company. He will be replaced by David Wehner, the former Zynga CFO, who has been Facebook's number two finance executive.

Having led HTC's industrial design and user experience teams since his One & Co studio was acquired in 2008, Croyle is now departing to work on his own projects. HTC confirmed Croyle's plans to The Verge, though the company describes the move as a ""long-term transition"" where he will remain involved with HTC product development in a consultancy role for a few months to come.  ""HTC remains at the forefront of smartphone innovation. Scott Croyle will be focusing on special projects and dedicated on next generation developments."" Croyle will occupy this transitional role while handing off his full set of responsibilities, the most important of which will be the development of next year's flagship HTC device. His second-in-command, Jonah Becker, is likely to take over most of his duties and step up to lead HTC's San Francisco studio. In a potentially related move, Drew Bamford has been promoted from overseeing the Sense user experience to being in charge of all HTC software and services. The company plans to simplify its internal structure by consolidating its user experience team much in the same that it did with its industrial design and engineering group. ""Drew Bamford is an experienced and talented leader at HTC with solid track records in leading and building our user experience team. Effective immediately, in addition to his current duties in product development and user experience, Drew will lead HTC Creative Labs and focus on innovative new products and user experience strategies."" Bamford will report directly to CEO Peter Chou, who has expressed a desire to return his attention to product design and leave the corporate side of the business to others. HTC's executive team has seen a lot of turnover in recent months, but Croyle's departure is the most significant one yet. Amid consistently slumping sales, the one bright light for HTC has been its critically acclaimed leadership in design.

But sales of the iPad were down 16 percent. Apple reported earnings of $10.2 billion, or $11.62 per share on $45.6 billion in revenue during a quarter that saw the release of no new products. That was above both the $42 to $44 billion in revenue Apple forecast for itself in January, and the $43.6 billion it reported the same time this last year. The company also announced a seven-for-one stock split, with a $90 billion stock buyback program. As usual, the thrust of that revenue came from iPhone sales. Apple said it sold 43.7 million iPhones during the quarter, up from the 37.4 million it sold during the same quarter last year. Apple also said it sold 16.3 million iPads, 4.1 million Macs, and 2.76 million iPods. That's a higher number than the 3.9 million Macs Apple sold in its previous second quarter, but down big from the 19.5 million iPads it reported. ""We're eagerly looking forward to introducing more new products."" ""We're very proud of our quarterly results, especially our strong iPhone sales and record revenue from services,"" Apple CEO Tim Cook said in a statement. ""We're eagerly looking forward to introducing more new products and services that only Apple could bring to market."" For its next quarter, which ends in June, Apple said it expects to bring in between $36 to $38 billion in revenue, which is up from the $35.3 billion it made during the same quarter a year ago, though lower than the $38.3 billion Wall Street forecasted.  The news sent Apple's stock to $564.47 a share, up $39.72 or 7.57 percent, in after hours trading. Wall Street was expecting earnings of $10.17 per share on revenue $43.5 billion. Apple's gross margin, or the amount the company makes after all costs are accounted for, came in at 39.3 percent. That's higher than the 37 to 38 percent the company forecast when reporting its previous quarter in January. It's also one of the most closely-watched numbers Apple reports since it's a key indicator not only of how Apple keeps its costs down, but also how it can grow its profits. Just two years ago, Apple's margins hit 47.4 percent, but have hovered some 10 percent lower for the past year. In recent quarterly calls with analysts, Apple's outgoing CFO Peter Oppenheimer has said this decline was due to higher costs of its products, changes in currency, and adjustments to the way the company does its accounting.  One other closely watched metric is iPad sales, which were down 16 percent from the 19.5 million the company sold during the same quarter last year. Wall Street was expecting a modest improvement of 20 to 22 million units sold. In a call with analysts, Apple's VP of finance Luca Maestri said the company viewed the drop in sales as closer to a 3 percent decline due to year-over-year channel inventory changes. Cook also chimed in, trying to put the overall sales of the iPad in comparison with the company's other products. ""We've come a long way, very very quickly."" ""We've sold over 210 million, which is more than we or anyone thought was possible in that period of time,"" Cook told analysts. ""That's almost twice as many iPhones as we've sold in a comparable amount of time ... we've come a long way, very very quickly."" The larger issue is the iPad's role as a replacement for traditional computers, including the Mac. The iPad began outselling Macs the same year it was introduced, but both its growth and the overall rise of tablets has slowed. According to a report released by IDC in January, much of the reason for that has centered on ""high levels of consumer saturation"" for tablets in the US.  Apple also said it would repurchase $90 billion in stock, up from the $60 billion the company announced last year. It also announced plans to split its stock seven ways on June 2nd, 2014, giving each shareholder an additional six shares. Trading on that split stock will begin on June 9th, 2014, the company said. The last time Apple split its stock was in 2005; the company also did it in 2000 and 1987. Despite the investor-friendly moves like an increased buyback and stock split, some have expressed caution, saying that Apple's masking poor fundamentals, namely the company's continued lack of earnings growth and new products. That includes lowered guidance for its full year. Apple is under a microscope Apple is under a microscope, with worries the company's biggest growth is behind it. While the iPhone and iPad vaulted sales and profits up, the rate at which those two products have grown has slowed. The big expectation for future growth comes from new product categories, be it a new wearable device or an upgraded set top box. Apple CEO Tim Cook has hinted at neither, though has vaguely (and repeatedly) said that the company is hard at work on new products. In the meantime, revamped versions of existing Apple products are expected at the company's annual developers conference in early June. Last year that brought new versions of OS X and iOS, along with upgraded MacBook Air and MacBook Pro models. Apple also previewed a redesigned Mac Pro that went on sale six months later. Ahead of this year's show Apple has promised new versions of OS X and iOS, but nothing else.

It argued that Comcast could use its newfound power to charge a toll for content that might compete with its own video offerings — a toll like the one that Netflix already found itself paying to improve the quality of streaming for Comcast customers. Comcast wasn't too happy about that, of course, firing back that it was Netflix's decision to cut out the middleman and work directly with Comcast to speed things up, and that the fee is standard practice for companies that offer ""transit service"" to quickly move data between networks. But in a new blog post, Netflix now claims that Comcast isn't truly offering ""transit service."" It accuses Comcast of extorting content companies and its own customers by charging twice for the same content. ""Comcast is double dipping by getting both... to pay for access to each other."" In the blog post, Netflix explains that while transit networks like Level3 and Cogent help carry traffic to every network on the internet, Comcast isn't performing that role. Comcast isn't even helping Netflix move the traffic — according to Netflix — but simply acting as a gatekeeper for its own customers. Yet those customers are already theoretically paying Comcast for access to whatever internet content they request, including Netflix, no? ""In this way, Comcast is double dipping by getting both its subscribers and Internet content providers to pay for access to each other,"" argues Netflix VP of content Ken Florance. Netflix also suggests that Comcast intentionally allowed its connections to existing transit providers like Cogent and Level3 to clog up in order to force the issue, but it's not clear who is actually at fault. No one wants to pay to upgrade the pipes if they can pass the costs to someone else. In a response to Netflix's latest attack, Comcast declined to directly address specific claims, but again accused Netflix of bending the truth and attempting to make Comcast pay the cost of transporting Netflix data. ""Comcast has a multiplicity of other agreements just like the one Netflix approached us to negotiate, and so has every other Internet service provider for the last two decades,"" writes Comcast.  ""And those agreements have not harmed consumers or increased costs for content providers - if anything, they have decreased the costs those providers would have paid to others."" The center of a raging debate on net neutrality This issue — charging a potentially discriminatory fee for access to certain kinds of content — is bigger than Comcast, Time Warner Cable, and Netflix, though. It's also at the heart of a raging debate on net neutrality right now. The FCC apparently wants to make discriminatory fees normal and legal as long as companies only charge ""commercially reasonable"" rates, and will soon vote on new rules that could make those fees okay.

The Wall Street Journal reports that Amazon is in the early stages of branching out its delivery operation into something that could eventually compete directly against UPS and FedEx — two companies that play a critical role in getting its packages to customers today. The online retailer is already testing such a service with trucks making ""last mile"" drop-offs in San Francisco, New York, and Los Angeles, according to the Journal. Aside from giving shoppers greater control over where and when they take a package, Amazon's big plan would also eventually cut expenses and bring the company closer to offering same-day delivery in more cities. Amazon has already established its own delivery network in the UK. UPS and FedEx are more experienced at this game The Journal notes that Amazon is ""several years away"" from becoming a full-fledged US delivery company  — assuming the company decides to pursue such a significant and challenging venture. But job listings suggest that Jeff Bezos is giving it serious thought. ""Amazon is growing at a faster speed than UPS and FedEx, who are responsible for shipping the majority of our packages,"" reads one recent posting cited by the Journal. ""At this rate Amazon cannot continue to rely solely on the solutions provided through traditional logistics providers. To do so will limit our growth, increase costs and impede innovation in delivery capabilities."" That same listing boldly proclaims Last Mile — the presumed name of Amazon's latest delivery push — as ""the answer"" to this obstacle. ""It is a program which is going to revolutionize how shipments are delivered to millions of customers."" Combined with Amazon's many distribution centers, Last Mile could help forge a powerful delivery network for the company. Or if Amazon chooses smaller goals, it could be a competitor to same-day delivery services from eBay and Google. Of course, Amazon can't start up a logistics company overnight. Instead, the company would at first rely on smaller, regional couriers and the US Postal Service to reduce its dependence on the two major shippers. But those carriers are often more prone to delays, making them the target of angry customer complaints. That's just another sign of the upward climb Amazon faces if it decides to someday back away from UPS and FedEx. But after a holiday season filled with missed deliveries, the company seems to be realizing it's simply growing too big too to stick with conventional methods.

Just two days after President Obama promised a proportionate response to the North Korean attack on Sony, the country mysteriously disappeared from the internet and stayed offline for the next 10 hours. Given the timing, the question was inevitable: was this the retaliation Obama had promised? But while it's tempting to connect the two, early reports suggest it's very unlikely that the downtime was the work of a government actor. ""I'm quite sure that this is not the work of the US government."" For a start, the timing doesn't add up. Arbor Networks' traffic monitoring project Atlas has been tracking denial of service attacks against North Korea all week, and it saw the first signs of an attack on Thursday, a full day before the FBI confirmed North Korean involvement. In his speech this Friday, President Obama pledged a proportionate response from the US, but also said he was still waiting for retaliatory options to be presented to him in the wake of the FBI's report, implying that he had not yet taken action. According to Atlas' data, the denial-of-service attacks against North Korea had already begun when Obama made that announcement, although they were not yet strong enough to bring the connection down entirely.  A graph from Atlas tracking the volume of attacks sent to North Korean IPs. (Note: The data from the 22nd is incomplete.) Denial-of-service attacks work by flooding a connection or server with so much phony traffic that it becomes impossible for legitimate traffic to get through. In North Korea's case, that connection is the country's single link to China Unicom, the pathway for all of the country's limited internet traffic. But while the flood of traffic eventually grew large enough to overwhelm the connection, Atlas' research suggests it was primarily directed at the public-facing websites for the DPRK and Kim Il-sung University, neither of which seem to be likely targets for a military operation. More importantly, the slow ramp-up of the attacks suggests group-limited capabilities. If Obama had really ordered a North Korean blackout, the resulting attack would have taken seconds, not days — and stayed offline for significantly more than 10 hours. ""I’m quite sure that this is not the work of the US government,"" concludes Atlas' Dan Holden. ""Much like a real world strike from the US, you probably wouldn’t know about it until it was too late. This is not the modus operandi of any government work."" The content delivery network CloudFlare, which does significant work in denial-of-service mitigation, took a similar line. Reached by The Verge, CloudFlare CEO Matthew Prince broke out three alternate scenarios: a hardware failure, a voluntary internet shutdown, or a cut-off on the part of China Unicom. ""I do think that it's highly unlikely that, if this was caused by an attack, that it was necessarily sponsored by a nation state,"" Prince said. Given the exceptionally low barrier to entry for a denial-of-service attack, nearly anyone on the web could be behind North Korea's connectivity problems. In fact, a number of online groups are already claiming responsibility, including an Anonymous-affiliated group called Lizard Unit. As with any Anonymous-linked claim, it's best to be skeptical — but as Prince put it, ""I'd be far more surprised if it was a government launching the attack than I would if it was a kid in a Guy Fawkes mask."" 12/22 23:15pm ET: Updated to reflect North Korean connections coming back online.",0.2994743647904862,0.7005256352095137,0.8282370835193555,578,5.1020761245674739,335,6.107462686567164,0,2,"US & World, National Security, Report",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

Wanted to get in touch and let you know about a rather peculiar video that just got uploaded on the Pornhub site. Turns out a drone pilot managed to stumble onto a couple getting hot-and-heavy in their apartment - windows open and everything while he taking his gadget out for a spin. Strange part is, the guy kept on filming like some sort of amateur porn director as this unsuspecting couple kept going at it, then uploaded the footage to our site. Thought this would make for a really cool...and maybe creepy story about drone tech. Anywho, here's a link to the vid on our site - some really weird/creepy stuff, I have to say. Let me know your thoughts on this when you get a chance. Looking forward to your feedback. Thanks! Best, Mike I assume I got this pitch because I do lots of writing and reporting on drones. The video (NSFW) appeared to have been shot with a drone outside the window of a hotel. If it was real, it was indeed very creepy. The clip had been uploaded to Pornhub by the anonymous user Droneman1 and tagged as amateur, implying it was a real couple. But I noticed a watermark on the video for a site called DroneHunter.com. I asked Mike about that, but he was adamant there was no connection to his company. At the time the website for DroneHunter.com was just a landing page with a cartoon drone and some text informing visitors it was ""under construction."" But when I clicked through the link at the bottom for customer support, I was redirected to a service site run by Mofos.com. That turned out to be a porn company owned by Mindgeek, a massive conglomerate that owns dozens of different sites, including, you guessed it, Pornhub. I emailed Mike to ask what was happening, but he plead ignorance, saying Mindgeek was a sprawling empire where lots of sites act independently. A concept even adult industry publicists pitch as ""creepy."" I find that hard to swallow, but this isn’t a story about the slippery practices of Pornhub’s PR. It’s a story about the fact that Pornhub, or its sister company, or its parent company, or some combination of the three, is creating an standalone website devoted to the idea of drone porn — a concept even adult industry publicists pitch as ""creepy.""  Verge Video: How will drones change the skies? | Subscribe to The Verge on YouTube Porn, as it has throughout history, is experimenting at the fringes of our legal and cultural norms, helping us to process exactly what it is we are afraid of or excited by, and why. But in this case, drone porn is also playing on real life fears generated by stalkers and peeping toms who have been testing the limits of the law in their experiments with drone technology, and the fetishes of those who crave ""illegal"" or amateur voyeurism. ""Porn takes advantage of an interest in seeing a new technology used."" ""Porn takes advantage of an interest in seeing a new technology used,"" says Clarissa Smith, a professor of sexual culture at the University of Sunderland. ""The laws and ethics kind of follow the technology, we’re not sure where it will go, and we have to learn and adapt. People in the porn industry can afford to take risks, to explore areas of society that others won’t."" The real-life drone users are pushing the limits in their cities, enabled by a Wild West landscape with little legal oversight. At the same time, the FAA is in the process of creating broad federal rules that will determine the future of the technology, and in the interim, states and even cities are stepping in to craft their own legislation, some of which is frighteningly restrictive. Concerns over privacy are as paramount as safety. The video Mike sent me depicted exactly the nightmare privacy scenario that have legislators worried: a couple being secretly filmed in the intimacy of their own home. That frame is a good tease, the classic ""peeping tom"" setup that so much of pornography is premised on, just updated with modern technology. By calling it ""creepy"" in the initial email, Pornhub was either expressing genuine concern or hoping I would take the bait and sound the alarm. It doesn’t work too hard to maintain the illusion. DroneHunter.com launched a few weeks after Mike’s initial email. It doubled down on the use of technology by adding FPV glasses in with drones. The fantasy it’s peddling is that the women involved were being filmed, without their knowledge, both by their partner and from the sky. Like most pornography, it doesn’t work too hard to maintain that illusion. Lots of the shots were clearly made on a set with standard film equipment. But Smith says that rarely matters. ""Drones are a framing device, that idea that you’re peeping in on something that we construct as really private."" Unlike the anatomical close ups that typify a lot of porn, Smith says the thrill of these videos isn’t what you see, but where it comes from. ""People will put up with crap visuals because they want to see how the new technology will be used. What’s arousing is the idea of new possibilities for voyeurism, more than the actual footage itself."" What matters more, in other words, isn’t the technological breakthroughs that drones enable for filming.

The page was created on Friday to organize a Moscow demonstration to support Alexei Navalny, an anti-Putin blogger who has been targeted by the Russian regime since 2011, when he spearheaded widespread anti-government protests. Last week, Russian prosecutors called for Navalny to serve a 10-year jail sentence on nebulous charges of embezzlement, sparking calls for pro-Navalny protests. The Facebook event page, which has 13,000 attendees as of Monday morning, was blocked within Russia on Saturday, though it remains online for users outside the country. The Washington Post reports that similar pages have since sprouted up and remain accessible in Russia. A spokesman for Roskomnadzor, Russia's communications regulator, told the Interfax news agency Saturday that the government had requested that Facebook block the page because it calls for ""unauthorized mass events"" and that its request ""is being fulfilled."" A controversial law passed earlier this year allows Russian regulators to block any sites that call for unauthorized demonstrations or publish ""extremist"" content. The pro-Navalny demonstration was to be held on January 15th, the day Navalny's verdict will be handed down, in Manezhnaya Square, near the Kremlin. A Facebook spokesperson told the Post that the company is currently investigating the matter. A Facebook spokeswoman declined to comment on this story. The crackdown continues   The Russian government has tightened its control over the internet in recent years, mirroring its broader crackdown on domestic television, newspapers, and other media outlets. This week's move comes amid continued economic turmoil in Russia and after Putin's annual marathon press conference on Thursday. During the three-hour press conference, Putin warned that ""the border line between the opposition and the fifth column is very thin,"" evoking a World War II-era term for government traitors. Facebook isn't as popular within Russia as the social network VK, which last year came under control of pro-Kremlin oligarchs after a hostile takeover. Both Facebook and Twitter have complied with government requests to block certain material in the past, and regularly acknowledge them in transparency reports. During the first six months of this year, Facebook removed 29 pieces of content at the request of the Russian government. A new law going into effect on January 1st requires internet companies to store data on Russian citizens within the country's borders, potentially making it easier for the government to monitor them.",0.4179730299619776,0.5820269700380224,0.8965724562117905,432,5.5462962962962967,264,6.5,0,0,"Policy & Law, US & World, Web",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

And it's pretty nuts. The season features three shorts introducing us to the new status quo — and new, darker takes on the three most iconic heroes in superherodom. From the first, it's already clear that Timm is digging deep to make this series and the upcoming movie as different from DC canon as possible, but with enough there to keep things recognizable. Take a look:  The first episode, Twisted, stars Batman, voiced here by Dexter's Michael C. Hall. The episode's title is extremely appropriate; Harley Quinn has holed herself up in a warehouse that she's turned into a funhouse filled with human remains. It's more unsettling as anything the Joker has ever pulled off in the comparatively cheerful animated series, but it all ends when Batman reveals himself to be a vampire. I'll admit here that it isn't my favorite.  The second episode, Bomb, stars none other than Superman, as he's called in to take down Brainiac. But this isn't Kal-El. This is the Son of Zod, and he looks the part. I won't spoil the ending, but it's simultaneously shocking, moving, and appropriate. Benjamin Bratt plays a Man of Steel who still seems grounded in his willingness to do what's right.  In the final episode, Big, we're introduced to Wonder Woman (Tamara Taylor), who's actually a New God of New Genesis here. Of course, we also meet Steve Trevor, who's ever the character's love interest. This episode has a bit more fun than the previous two, but there's no question that these characters are willing to kill when necessary.

The film has crushed industry estimates, and has raked in a record $525.4 million globally, making it the first to ever break half a billion dollars over its opening weekend. That number comes from $208.8 million domestically, beating The Avengers' record $207.4 million weekend haul in 2012. The Colin Trevorrow-directed film also earned $315.61 million abroad, outstripping the international weekend record held by Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 ($314 million). The international figure for Jurassic World includes $100.1 million from China alone. Any way you measure it, then, Universal's fourth entry in the dinosaur franchise is a massive box office success. Universal originally released its figures on Sunday, but was apparently a bit conservative with its domestics estimates on Sunday because of competition with the game five of the NBA Finals. Ultimately, Jurassic World beat The Avengers domestically for best opening weekend ever, showing that moviegoers weren't too bothered that the movie rejects modern science with its featherless dinos. 'Jurassic World' could beat 'The Avengers' for biggest domestic opening ever  Part of Jurassic World's success comes from big numbers at 3D, IMAX, and premium large format theaters. Roughly half of the box office numbers came from 3D ticket sales, and the action flick took in $44.1 million globally from IMAX theaters — crushing the record set by Iron Man 3 of $28.8 million. 90 percent of the Chinese box office sales came from 3D tickets The movie, of course, marks yet another massive hit starring Chris Pratt. Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy turned Pratt into a star, and last year also saw the massive success of The Lego Movie. Don't be surprised if you see Pratt in more major blockbusters over the next few years. The gigantic box office numbers give Universal two huge hits this year, in the form of Furious 7 and Jurassic World. If the studio manages to take the record for largest weekend opening away from The Avengers, you can be sure Disney will be looking to take back the crown this December with Star Wars: The Force Awakens.

We talked to Trevorrow about what that jump was like, and how some of the big screen pressures influenced Jurassic World's themes. TrackingPoint kept making headlines for its ambitious project to create a rifle that never missed a shot. But inside the company, a lot was going wrong.

Can anything be done to stop bad science from getting published? It's a daunting task given the millions of papers published each year, but a new movement in peer review could help expose fakers more quickly than scientists have done in the past. Elon Musk, Larry Page, and Travis Kalanick all showed up to the final event of DARPA's Robotics Challenge, which says a lot about how exciting this technology can be. The only problem? The tech isn't very mature, so the humanoid robots still need a lot of human help to get by. WiredAndrew Rice reports on the decision-making process behind the World Trade Center’s final tower design. When Bjarke Ingels set out to create the fourth and final skyscraper at the reborn World Trade Center earlier this year, he faced the same dilemma that has burdened every architect who has ventured onto New York’s most hallowed and expensive construction site. Would he design a stately tower, respectful of the history of the property, where some 3,000 people died in 2001? Or would Ingels, a brash Danish prodigy, follow his instincts and steer the building in a more adventurous direction—and risk running into the controversy that has dashed the ambitions of many a World Trade Center architect before him? BloombergPaul Ford masterfully unpacks the mystery of code in a 38,000 word missive. So many things are computers, or will be. That includes watches, cameras, air conditioners, cash registers, toilets, toys, airplanes, and movie projectors. Samsung makes computers that look like TVs, and Tesla makes computers with wheels and engines. Some things that aren’t yet computers—dental floss, flashlights—will fall eventually. When you ""batch"" process a thousand images in Photoshop or sum numbers in Excel, you’re programming, at least a little. When you use computers too much—which is to say a typical amount—they start to change you. I’ve had Photoshop dreams, Visio dreams, spreadsheet dreams, and Web browser dreams. The dreamscape becomes fluid and can be sorted and restructured. I’ve had programming dreams where I move text around the screen. Aeon Lizzie Wade explores the potential ethical dilemmas that might come with meeting extraterrestrial life. It wasn’t the Martians’ fault their planet died. If they existed – once – Martians were likely microbes, living in a world much like our own, warmed by an atmosphere and crisscrossed by waterways. But Mars began to lose that atmosphere, perhaps because its gravity wasn’t strong enough to hold onto it after an asteroid impact, or perhaps it was gradually blown away by solar winds. The cause is still mysterious, but the ending is clear: Mars’s liquid water dried up or froze into ice caps, leaving life without its most precious resource. Any Martians would have been victims of a planet-wide natural disaster they could neither foresee nor prevent. The New Yorker Carolyn Kormann tells the story of Chris Eyer and his popular Instagram account that he uses to detail the lives of his nine mules. It was a sunny spring afternoon at the U.S. Forest Service’s Ninemile Remount Depot, in western Montana, where working horses and mules are bred, reared, trained, and wintered. Soon, rangers from districts across the Rocky Mountains would come to retrieve their pack animals for the summer season. (The animals are crucial to resupplying outposts in federally designated wilderness areas, where motorized and wheeled vehicles are banned.) I was stopping at the depot on my way to meet Chris Eyer, who once took a packing class here. Down the hill, by the corrals, a mule-driving class was just letting out. I asked one of the students, a ranger with five summers’ experience in the nearby Bob Marshall Wilderness, whether he had ever encountered Eyer. ""Yeah, I know Chris,"" he said, peering at me from under the brim of a droopy-edged felt hat. ""You’re the third person who’s asked me about him this week. Isn’t he, like, the most famous guy in Montana or something?""  The New York Times Magazine Samantha M. Shapiro spends time with young — as in 11 years old — preachers in Brazil. Adauto invited those in need of healing to the base of the stage. Roughly half the congregants made their way forward. Some hobbled, and some were held up by attendants. Many had copies of recent medical exams in their hands. Alani stood onstage wearing a pink dress and cardigan with matching sparkly shoes, nervously finger-combing her hair. She made her way slowly through the line of sufferers as they explained their symptoms: low platelet counts, chronic anxiety, swollen joints. She listened to each story with precocious focus and empathy, seeming to grasp both the gravity of their ailments and the gravity of her own power to ease them. When she had heard from everyone, Alani looked up at the deacons, who had positioned themselves behind the line. The men signaled that they were ready for her to begin.

During a Twitch streaming test yesterday, Arkane Studios' Harvey Smith and Ralph Colantonio were caught discussing a scheduled presentation about Dishonored, hinting that Bethesda would use its E3 show to unveil a sequel to 2012's stab-happy stealth game.

The sequel to the sprawling Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas is set in a Boston slowly rebuilding after being ravaged by nuclear war. Details are thin at the moment, but as in Fallout 3, the player character looks set to get their own dog — always a plus in any game.   The show should also see mention of the upcoming Doom game. Technically Doom 4, but simply titled Doom, the game was teased last month with a tiny 12-second trailer. So far we know it has guns, demons, and demons shooting guns. There's also an outside chance we'll see an update on Prey 2 — a game in a state of development limbo having been shown off at E3 2011 before being canned in 2014 — and a teaser for the next Elder Scrolls game. While it's unlikely Bethesda would split the limelight between the Elder Scrolls and Fallout series, it's been four years since Skyrim saw release.

Thing is, she doesn’t want one as much as I want her to have one. See, Nguyen’s phone is always in a bag. Her phone doesn’t fit in her tiny front pockets, and she’s wise enough not to carry it in the back in a city where pockets are occasionally picked. Of course, when she’s wearing a skirt or dress she doesn’t have any pockets at all. A confluence of fashion and technology that, despite our vows, could our union put asunder. Slack, Whatsapp, Messages, SMS, and DM have conditioned me to expect real-time access to my friends and colleagues. When I hit send I expect a response within seconds, and definitely within a few minutes. Otherwise, my mind races to black: are they dead? did I offend? is the internet down?  This type of communication works because the recipient either hears or feels my advances. But when I try to communicate with my wife — the most important person in my life — I never know when she might respond because she often misses the alert. What's usually just an annoyance can quickly foster panic during the inevitable family emergency. That’s where smartwatch alerts can help. On a recent trip to the Apple store Nguyen saw the Watch for the first time. “Ohhh nice,” she said, eyes widened with delight. A response she’s never expressed when looking at my Pebble or a Galaxy Gear. She likes the 38mm Sport model with white band, but at €400 she also says it’s too expensive.  Truth be told, Nguyen doesn’t want a smartwatch at all but she might humor me by wearing it if I gave it to her as a gift. In that way, it’s a lot like lingerie: I benefit directly by giving her something with more frills than what she usually wears; that’s really just an expensive, pretty, and sexed-up variation of something far more utilitarian. An object that ultimately interests me a lot more than it interests her. If you're anything like me, then the first thing you do when you reach the office in the morning is dig into your pocket, take out your smartphone, and place it next to your computer where you can catch any incoming calls or messages. With this in mind, Samsung's new SE370 monitor with built-in wireless charging for mobile devices makes complete sense to me. I keep a normal charger at work in case I'm going out in the evening and need to top up my phone, but it would be easier to just drop my phone underneath my screen to start charging. The gentleman patiently walking me through the controls of the McLaren 650S Spider stopped mid-sentence and eyed me, as if he’d picked up on a tell in my body language.

Read next: Our Windows 10 review. Tuesday night at midnight ET, Microsoft will release the first full release of Windows 10, the biggest sea change in PC software in nearly three years. It's kind of a big deal! We've been getting previews of Windows 10 since October, and the rollout of the actual software will happen in stages, but midnight will still be zero hour for answering a lot of the questions that have swirled around Windows 10 since it was first announced. How do you build a single OS for laptops, tablets, and smartphones? Tuesday night, we'll find out. First thing's first: how do you get it? Microsoft is sending out Windows 10 in waves, starting with Windows Insiders and then moving through preorders gradually. The waves are designed to make the release more stable — issues that pop up in one wave can be fixed for the next one — but it means it could be days before you actually get the chance to download the new OS. At the same time, some Windows 7 and 8 users have already noticed full installer files being downloaded ahead of the official launch. What will Windows 10 look like when it arrives? The good news is that, unlike Windows 8, Windows 10 is designed to work as a straight upgrade, so as long as your computer meets the specs, you should be able to install it right away. Still, we definitely recommend doing a full backup before you install. If you've got Windows 7 or Windows 8, you'll be able to upgrade free any time in the next year. Otherwise, the official price is $119, although third party sellers are already offering cheaper versions for pre-order, to ship at the end of the month. But the bigger question is what Windows 10 will look like when it finally does arrive — and you won't have to wait days to find out. The Verge and other outlets are going to be putting the OS through its paces as soon as it becomes public, which means Microsoft fans will have a lot to piece through on Tuesday night and Wednesday morning. To start with, there's a whole new interface to work through. Based on developer previews, Windows 10 seems to be a combination of the best features from 7 and 8, but it also comes with a lot of new ideas that have never been implemented at this scale. Cortana will be everywhere in Windows 10, available in the Start Menu and through voice commands. It's also the first big stage for Microsoft's new Edge browser, a fully revamped notification center, and deeper Xbox integration than we've ever seen before. And then there's the biggest question of all: will it be ready? As recently as June, there were still some troubling and persistent upgrade bugs kicking around the developer preview. As Tom Warren put it at the time, ""the Windows team has a lot of sleepless nights ahead throughout June and July to ensure the quality is high across the vast amount of PCs out there."" After Vista and Windows 8, there's a lot of pressure to make sure this launch goes smoothly, but engineers have been fighting an uphill battle to make it happen. Still, we won't know for sure until Windows 10 goes live on Tuesday. Will the new Cortana outpace Siri? Are we on the cusp of a PC renaissance?

However, if 30 seconds isn't enough time for you to spot an error (or realize that that's actually a totally inappropriate thing to say to your boss), then you might want to try Dmail: a Chrome extension that allows Gmail users to revoke access to an email any time after sending. You can even set a self-destructing timer that automatically makes an email inaccessible an hour, a day, or a week later. Dmail doesn't actually delete messages from users' inboxes Perhaps the most useful thing about Dmail is that it works even if not installed on a recipient's computer. This is because the service doesn't actually delete messages from users' inboxes, but instead encrypts and decrypts them on demand. Users who receive a Dmail and don't have the extension installed are shown a ""View Message"" button that opens the email in a new tab. (If they do have Dmail installed, then the message is just shown within Gmail.) After a sender revokes access to an email — either manually or automatically — recipients are informed that ""this message has been destroyed and is no longer available."" Self-destructing email with DmailPreviousNextView full GalleryPreviousNext Dmail's Eric Kuhn explains to TechCrunch that whenever a user sends a message with the service, it's encrypted locally on their machine with a standard 256-bit algorithm. ""An encrypted copy of that email is sent to a datastore controlled by Dmail. The recipient of the email is sent both the location of that datastore, as well as a key to view the decrypted message,"" says Kuhn. ""Neither Gmail nor Dmail servers ever receive both the decryption key and encrypted message. Only the recipient and sender can read the email legibly."" If you revoke access to an embarrassing email, you'll still have to explain why It's a neat trick, but it's not quite the same as deleting a sent email remotely. This means that using Dmail as a security measure makes more sense than as a face-saving ""Undo Send"" option. After all, if you do revoke access to a message a few minutes after sending, you'll still have to explain to the recipient what was so regrettable about the email in the first place. (The excuse ""Oh, I'm just testing this new service out"" only works the first couple of times.) Still, Dmail is slick and easy to use, and the team responsible (part of social bookmarking service Delicious) have plans to extend its functionality, rolling out support for iOS and Android later this year, as well as hopefully adding a ""self-destruct"" functionality to document attachments. They also have plans to make Dmail a freemium service, with extra options for paying businesses and power users.

Dubbed ""Stagefright,"" the vulnerability affects roughly 950 million Android devices worldwide, according to researcher estimates, although the most vulnerable devices are those running pre-Jelly Bean versions of Android. Google has released a patch for the vulnerability to manufacturers, but most have not yet pushed that update to customers. Zimperium hasn't released all the details of the attack, pending a more detailed presentation at the Black Hat conference next month, but it appears to target how Android processes video, specifically in the phone's MMS messaging capability. Attackers could exploit that vulnerability sending out malicious code disguised as a video message. Once the exploit takes hold, an attacker would gain the power to execute code remotely, compromising the phone's microphone, cameras, or any number of other core functions. In the most vulnerable cases, a user would not even have to interact with the message in order for the code to execute. Google seems to have had little difficulty in coding a patch for the vulnerability, but deploying that patch may prove very difficult, given the widespread fragmentation in the Android ecosystem. With only 12 percent of devices running the latest version of Android, many carriers simply aren't deploying updates for Android phones on their network, creating long-standing patch deployment problems. Typically, those have been solved with application-level updates, but a function as fundamental as MMS may prove more challenging for Android's security team.",0.31648255097767314,0.6835174490223268,0.4002940184541961,249,5.738955823293173,163,6.6134969325153374,0,0,"Google, Mobile, Tech",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I keep a normal charger at work in case I'm going out in the evening and need to top up my phone, but it would be easier to just drop my phone underneath my screen to start charging. (That is, of course, if I actually had a phone with wireless charging — a rather large flaw in this plan.) You'll need a phone that supports the Qi wireless charging standard to use the SE370 If you do have a phone that supports the Qi wireless charging standard (such as Samsung's own Galaxy S6, or the LG G3), then the SE370 monitor might be worth a look. It's available in 23.6- and 27-inch variants, although the 1920 x 1080 resolution might be a bit disappointing for anyone familiar with the new generation of cinematic, 34-inch displays. The SE370 also supports AMD FreeSync, which Samsung says makes for a smoother refresh rate when gaming (although only if you're using an AMD graphics card). Unfortunately, there's no word on either pricing or availability at the moment, but we'll be curious to see if other manufacturers pick up this trend.

But after a 2,500 mile journey, the giant globe was stuck at 71st Street and Central Park West, and cops were getting nervous about the crush of people stuck behind it. Someone suggested moving the balloon forward a few feet to ease the congestion. “If people would just follow the Earth,” suggested Officer Cummings, sheepish in the presence of such an obvious metaphor. “We need help over here!” an organizer yelled out, and people rushed to grab the ropes. The crowd inched forward, spreading out. We did it, guys! We saved the Earth!  This past Sunday saw the biggest global climate change demonstration in history – organizers estimated a turnout out of 300,000 people in New York alone. In theory, the entire march had been organized by the climate change organization 350.org, but the reality on the ground was a patchwork of different groups, each managing its own bloc and its own agenda. Sting was there, along with Kevin Bacon and Ban Ki-moon. The goal was to pressure the delegates of the upcoming United Nations Climate Summit to take action, and nudge the world to grapple with climate change – but everyone already knew that it wouldn’t be that simple.  Last year, CO2 levels rose faster than they ever have, despite decades of alarm bells. A catastrophic drought is hitting California as the Louisiana coastline sinks into the ocean. The costs of inaction get higher and higher, and we aren’t even slowing down. What it would it look like to do something about it? What would that even mean? In the 25 blocks from 59th Street to 86th Street, I counted at least four other globes, including a melting-ice-cream Earth that had been commissioned by Ben & Jerry’s in a canny bit of socially conscious cross-promotion. (""If it’s melted, it’s ruined,"" the slogan read.) The more elaborate floats had lined up early, planning for an 11AM kickoff, but at half past noon we hadn’t started moving yet. The streets were clotted with people, but there was nowhere to go. Streetlights flicked from green to yellow to red above our heads. Higher up, a police chopper paced back and forth. Every 20 minutes or so, a cheer would rise up from the crowd at random. Maybe this was it? Then it would settle down and we would go back to waiting. The floats eventually headed downtown through the office blocks of Midtown and across Times Square. The marching order went by an elaborate thematic choreography, which got muddled almost immediately. The front of the demonstration was reserved for people directly affected by climate change (""Frontlines to the Front""), primarily indigenous communities and Rockaways residents. After that came ""We Build The Future,"" which put organized labor marching alongside mothers and children, followed by Food Bloc, Bike Bloc and the Anti-Capitalist Bloc (lumped together as ""We Have Solutions""), with a mix of scientists and beekeepers trailing behind. Rabbis and ministers rode together in a makeshift ark – a log cabin built on top of a parade float — shaking hands and giving out bags of animal crackers that read ""we are all Noah."" As the first marchers crossed 39th Street, you could see the row of cardboard sunflowers they were holding from blocks away. Behind them, one group pushed a faux-stone totem while another operated a giant Mother Earth puppet, waving ominously over the crowd. As each bloc reached the concrete spit outside the Javits Center, an organizer was there to tell them, ""Thank you for changing the world!"" When it was over, the cops cleared the streets, and the marchers filtered back into Midtown. The rabbis and ministers headed uptown to St. John the Divine and a tow truck hauled Noah’s Ark back to New Jersey. ""People’s Climate March isn’t talking about the crisis,"" an organizer named Winnie Wong told me. ""The crisis is capitalism."" The morning after the march, I was standing with her at Battery Park for Flood Wall Street, a kind of aftershock march for hundreds of activists who thought Sunday had been too tame. Bill McKibben, 350.org’s founder and the march’s organizer, stopped by, although he told us he was there as a friend, not a participant. ""We’re not marching to celebrate,"" Winnie said. ""There’s no celebration at all. It’s a confrontation. It’s a peaceful, non-violent confrontation, but we are there to confront."" A man named Matt told me he had missed Sunday’s march entirely, coming down last night to sleep in Penn Station and then walking to Battery Park at five in the morning, just in time to watch the sun rise over the water. Organizers told us that Battery Park was a Green Zone, a place for lawful free assembly, and that the arrests would only come once we had stepped outside the Green Zone in a spirit of civil disobedience. But unlike Sunday’s march, the NYPD hadn’t been told about any of this in advance, and there was no telling how thoroughly they had grokked the whole Green Zone concept. The idea was to surge toward Wall Street like floodwaters (the demonstration’s preferred metaphor), flowing into every available outlet. Organizers talked us up in the halting cadence of the people’s mic, pausing to repeat each line to the rows that were farther back. ""Blood is the water in our bodies! (blood is the water in our bodies!) The oil and gas they are extracting is the blood of the earth! (the oil and gas they are extracting is the blood of the earth!)"" Most people I talked to expected to be dragged into police vans the moment they set foot outside the park, maybe even before. Instead, the cops held back. The first wave of marchers made it out of the park and one full block north before the barricades stopped them. The police stayed on the side, holding the barricades and trying to channel the crowd. The flood stopped traffic, weaving between freight trucks and double-decker tourist buses, but all the police did was watch. Once the block was taken, the protesters sat down and started singing. A Carbon Bubble balloon floated up and down the block, and a wiry, brown-haired man from the Industrial Workers of the World jumped on top of a phone booth to explain how we could seize all industry and discard whatever was unsustainable. After about an hour, the police plucked him out of the crowd like a lobster from a tank. Past the barricades, you could see them marching him into the van, one on each side holding him upright, his toes dragging behind him on the pavement. They stayed there until dark, with a little over 100 people carted off by the end. You wonder, maybe, how so many people ended up in the barricades, or why so many decided to leave the park before they knew it was safe. As we walked out, a man explained it to a reporter: ""I don’t want to look back and say, I went home that day."" You only get so many chances to do something, so by the time one comes along you’re desperate for it. Outside of a speech at the New School on Saturday, a man named Gene Fry was handing out CDs with details on low-till farming. There were people like that everywhere, pushing communist reading groups or geoengineering conspiracies. Fry wasn’t a nut though. He was just desperate, like everyone. He had charts with the same figures you see everywhere: rising CO2 levels, shrinking ice caps, all the usual horsemen. Three hundred thousand people in the street, and Fry had come away thinking he was the only one who knew how bad it could get. He had come all the way from western Massachusetts. By coming here, he could get the message out to 500 people, which was enough to make it worthwhile. Why 500? Well, he had 500 CDs.",0.2584821709903028,0.7415178290096972,0.8627985371164613,1357,4.7745025792188649,717,5.9930264993026503,0,12,"Science, Report",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Thanks to a successful Kickstarter fundraising effort two years ago, one motley crew of engineers and scientists called LiftPort has been working on turning that idea into reality, and now they're getting their own documentary: Shoot the Moon is a film-in-progress that plans to record LiftPort's upcoming attempt to send an unmanned robot on a 30,000-foot high climb along a tether attached to a high-altitude balloon. The creators of the documentary have taken inspiration from their subjects and are today launching their own Kickstarter project seeking $37,000 to finish their film documenting LiftPort's audacious attempt. ""There's kind of a science fiction appeal to this and the film is going to have that for sure,"" says Benjamin Ahr Harrison, the first-time feature film director behind the documentary. Indeed, if Shoot the Moon can reach its relatively modest Kickstarter fundraising goals, they want to build and film miniature models of a completed, futuristic space elevator, giving their film the kind of otherworldly practical effects seen in the original Star Wars trilogy and 2001: A Space Odyssey. If LiftPort's robot launch goes off as planned in the coming months, the film should be finished and ready to screen by the fall of 2015.     Already, Ahr says he and his colleagues have filmed 60-75 percent of the interviews needed for the film, many with LiftPort's founder Michael Laine, a smooth-talking ex-NASA contractor. Laine says after initially balking at the idea of a documentary, he agreed to give Harrison full and independent access to his work. ""Public awareness is as important as the actual engineering,"" Laine says. ""We could have all the parts for a space elevator sitting in a warehouse, ready to go, but we can't build it without public support."" ""we can't build it without public support."" To his point, LiftPort plans to approach its ultimate goal of an earth-to-space elevator in three main stages: first building a prototype climbing robot here on earth — named ""Neil,"" after Neil Armstrong, the first person to walk on the moon, naturally — which Shoot the Moon will film. Then, LiftPort wants to build a full working space elevator on the moon, a lunar elevator, where the lower gravity and absence of atmosphere would theoretically allow for the use of existing materials. Finally, once that works, they want to try and build a full Earth elevator, which would require a whole new class of materials for the cable. There is no firm timeline for these latter projects, but it's safe to say they are decades out at best. It's worth pointing out this isn't Laine's first attempt: LiftPort tried and failed to build a full space elevator over a decade ago, eventually going out of business in 2007. Laine has given several reasons for his initial failure, including the 2007-2008 global financial crisis and the fact that he wasn't able to research any materials capable of building a tether strong and flexible enough for Earth's atmosphere. ""Once I had gotten my brain wrapped around [the space elevator], I spent the next eight years beating my head against a brick wall,"" Laine says. Undaunted, he returned in 2012 with a space elevator proposal that raised $110,000 on Kickstarter, allowing him to relaunch LiftPort. And for all of the self-described ""bumps"" in Laine's quest, he does have some success to lean on: the last time LiftPort tried something like this, in 2006, the company succeeded in sending a robot climbing up a tether a mile high. Whether this time works out quite as well, Harrison will be there recording it all for posterity.",0.6230974005695038,0.3769025994304962,0.33223560500160076,660,5.0106060606060607,379,6.047493403693931,0,0,Science,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Previously, the WHO has warned that 20,000 could be infected before the disease is contained. Today's report is less optimistic. Already there have been more than 4,000 confirmed cases and almost 2,300 confirmed deaths from the disease, but those numbers are almost certainly underestimates, according to WHO data published by the New England Journal of Medicine. The number of cases is continuing to double every 16 days in Guinea, every 24 days in Liberia and every 30 days in Sierra Leone, the report says. ""Without a more-effective, all-out effort, Ebola could become endemic in West Africa.""    It's crucial to get the infections under control, because ""without a more-effective, all-out effort, Ebola could become endemic in West Africa,"" according to an accompanying editorial written by Jeremy Farrar of the Wellcome Trust and Peter Piot of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. If  that happens, then Ebola may spread to other parts of Africa and  beyond. The epidemic is ""unprecedented in scale,"" the report says. The previous largest outbreak had 425 cases over the course of three months in 2000 and 2001 in Uganda. The severity of the current outbreak isn't because the virus has changed; it hasn't. Rather, the problem is that disease control efforts haven't been good enough. Though the outbreak began in December 2013 in some districts of Guinea, the WHO wasn't notified of the outbreak until March 23, 2014. Nine months since the first case, the epidemic is still growing, despite international efforts to control the spread of the disease. The number of Ebola patients is now greater than the number of  hospital beds in Guinea, Libera and Sierra Leone, the WHO report said. There are shortages of  healthcare workers and basics like soap and water in some of the  countries. Because Ebola is spread mostly through contact with the bodily fluids of infected people—sweat, tears, blood, vomit—transmissions can be halted with early diagnosis, patient isolation, infection control, and safe burial. Also crucial is tracing anyone who's been in contact with an infected person and monitoring those people for symptoms for 21 days, by which time most people who have been infected are sick.""We basically need 20,000 more healthcare workers on the ground."" ""The infrastructure has been a huge factor,"" says Daniel Epstein, a spokesman for the WHO. ""There were very few clinics and hospitals. The few they had were overwhelmed rapidly, and they didn't have great infection control practices, so they lost a lot of healthcare workers."" Determining the fatality rate of this epidemic is tricky, since some patients weren't diagnosed with Ebola until after their deaths. That's because the symptoms of Ebola look an awful lot like the symptoms of the more-common malaria: fever, fatigue, and loss of appetite. Still, WHO estimates that roughly 70 percent of people who are infected will die. Previous Ebola outbreaks have suggested that the pattern of  disease spread can be broken within 2 to 3 weeks of infection control  measures, the report says. To reduce the spread, monitoring contacts of a  patient is important; so too is getting someone who's sick to the  hospital immediately—right now, most patients don't come in until a mean  of 5 days after their symptoms begin. ""We basically need 20,000 more healthcare workers on the ground,"" Epstein says. ""We need doctors and nurses and we need to set up functioning Ebola treatment centers. We need 3,000 vehicles to carry the patients. We need to contract tracers, who can monitor everyone in contact with an infected person and take them in for treatment if they're positive for Ebola."" Last week, the US announced it would send 3,000 troops to the affected areas, and help build medical centers in Liberia, which has been hardest-hit by the epidemic. More than $500 million will be drawn from defense spending to aid the affected countries. Britain and France have also agreed to build treatment centers, while the World Bank and Unicef have sent supplies—100 metric tons of them on September 17. In their editorial, Farrar and Piot characterize international response as ""highly inadequate and late."" Not only did it take 3 months to determine that an Ebola outbreak was taking place, but it was not until 2 months had passed and 1,000 people died that anyone declared a public health emergency.

Now the heirs of that sizable fortunate are doing a 180: the Rockefeller Brothers Fund, a philanthropic organization with investments worth $860 million, announced plans today to divest the from the majority its holdings in fossil fuels over the coming years. The fund will begin by reducing its investments in two major polluting energy sources — coal and tar sands — to less than one percent of its entire portfolio by the end of this year, then sell-off any remaining fossil fuel investments ""as quickly as is prudent"" over the coming years, according to a statement on the fund's website. The fund plans to move more of its money into clean energy investments instead, a notable move given the rapid development of Canada's oil sands in recent years. Per the leaders of the fund, it's precisely what John D. Rockeller would have wanted.

That's the best-case scenario. The worst-case scenario is 1.5 million people infected in Sierra Leone and Liberia by January. Guinea wasn't included in the estimate because the cases there have varied in ways that can't be reliably modeled. To end the epidemic in January, about 70 percent of people who are infected need to be treated at an Ebola treatment facility or at home to reduce disease transmission, according to CDC data. Right now, only 18 percent of Liberian patients and 40 percent of those in Sierra Leone are receiving that kind of care.  ""Even poor clinical services can cut the death rate in half,"" Frieden  says. Treatment for Ebola generally involves making sure patients stay  hydrated. Hospital treatment does this using an IV; at home, families  should give patients water and time. The numbers are from an Ebola modeling tool that the CDC released today, based on  data available at the end of August. Changes since August make the worst-case scenario unlikely, as the US and other  countries have pledged aid to the West African countries. Supplies and more people are already on the ground. Given the  changes since August, Friedan says, ""I am confident the most-dire  projections are not going to come to pass.""

Yesterday's report from WHO found that the number of Ebola patients is now greater than the number of  hospital beds in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. The CDC report suggested alternate methods of treatment, based at home or in community centers, where relatives are provided with the gear required to keep from getting infected. That means gloves and disinfectant, gowns and masks, according to an NPR report. The US government is sending 400,000 kits containing those tools to Liberia, to help care for patients who don't make it to a hospital.

After launching in November 2013, an Indian spacecraft called Mangalyaan finally reached the red planet's orbit early Wednesday morning, marking what Prime Minister Narendra Modi described as a ""near impossible"" feat. The successful mission makes India the first Asian country to reach Mars' orbit, beating neighboring rival China, whose 2012 attempt ended in failure. The country's Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM) was also financed for just $74 million — less than it cost to make the movie Gravity, as Modi and others have pointed out.   ""The odds were stacked against us.""   ""The odds were stacked against us,"" Modi said at a press conference today. ""When you are trying to do something that has not been attempted before, it is a leap into the unknown. And space is indeed the biggest unknown out there."" Mangalyaan, which means ""Mars craft"" in Hindi, is expected to last about six months before it runs out of fuel. It won't land on Mars, but will use five scientific instruments to gather data about the planet's surface and atmosphere. The 3,000-pound spacecraft isn't as technologically complex as those launched by the US and Russia, but reaching orbit is no small feat. As Modi said during today's press conference, only 21 of the 51 previous attempts to reach Mars have been successful. India's space program is still small relative to other major players, and operated for years under global isolation following sanctions for a nuclear missile test in the 1970s. But Modi has made clear his intent to expand India's program under his tenure, saying the country could become a leading supplier of low-cost technology.

So too are the tissues they use to conduct tests. Despite the loads of research demonstrating important biological differences between how men and women react to various drugs or diseases, the default study subject is male. That trend’s about to change, as the world’s largest medical funding agency — the US National Institutes of Health — announced today that it would grant a total of $10 million to 80 researchers who will study the effects of gender in their work. To ""overcome historical gaps in our knowledge of female biology"" ""These awards are investments in science, helping us go deeper, and enabling a transformative shift that can overcome historical gaps in our knowledge of female biology,"" said Janine Clayton, NIH’s associate director for research on women’s health. They’re also the first step in a funding policy change that will soon force researchers to consider sex differences at the non-human, preclinical research stage if they wish to obtain federal grants. One such instance is traumatic brain injury — women tend to recover faster than men. For some reason, women’s brains seem to have a protective benefit that researchers don’t understand. So ""imagine if we knew more,"" Clayton said, ""and could take lessons learned from the female brain to help men and boys recover faster."" Another example is heart attacks. Women show different symptoms than men, and these are often dismissed by physicians. If we could study this more closely, Clayton says, then perhaps we could develop ""clinical decision support software [for] emergency rooms that took sex into account."" There are many reasons for the current gap in our knowledge of female biology. Historically, scientists have been men, who have largely studied themselves. That, combined with the (incorrect) idea that hormonal changes in female animals could destroy statistically significant results, made for extremely male-centered research. And even though many researchers today acknowledge that sex differences are worth investigating, paltry funding has slowed efforts to understand them. Historically, scientists have been men, who have largely studied themselves ""The larger the variability with each group, the greater the sample size needed to detect differences,"" said Brian Stauffer, a vascular biologist at the University of Colorado and one of the grantees, in an email to The Verge. So ""the bottom line is large group size means more expense."" Stauffer himself had fallen victim to this kind of budgetary constraint. His study, which began in 2013, is aimed at investigating the differences between heart failure in children and adults. Because of initial budgetary constraints, though, his research team was unable to include enough tissue samples to properly examine sex differences. Now, with the NIH’s grant, the researchers will increase the number of children in the study, which Stauffer says will allow them to ""understand some of the unique aspect of heart failure in boys versus girls."" Changes among scientists will be gradual. But today’s announcement is meant to alert medical researchers that these changes are, indeed, coming. Details about the policy and implementation plans will roll out gradually over the course of the next year, and the NIH will take the time to consider scientists’ concerns. But ""in the long term,"" Clayton said, ""we want scientists to consider sex from the start.""",0.6614820816375129,0.3385179183624871,0.7753848951361381,553,5.3869801084990963,341,6.1378299120234603,0,0,"Science, Report",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Using the BICEP2 telescope positioned at the bottom of our planet, the scientists said they were able to find evidence of gravitational ripples in space that they said were echoes of the Big Bang. But a new report has cast doubt on the BICEP2 team's findings, suggesting that the ripples might not be telltale waves left over from the moment of our universe's creation, but simply clouds of space dust that happened to coalesce into swirling shapes after being polarized by magnetic fields. The apparent gravitational waves could just be clouds of dust The report, authored by astronomers using data from the European Space Agency's Planck satellite, says that the dust is so pervasive in outer space that it's incredibly difficult to see the gravitational waves the BICEP2 team was looking for. If identified, the spiral waves would support the popular theory of Inflation, which says that the universe expanded exponentially a trillionth of a second after the start of the Big Bang. But the new report says that ""even in the faintest dust-emitting regions there are no ‘clean' windows in the sky"" through which the theorized gravitational waves could be fully observed. The BICEP2 team asked Planck scientists for data at the time of the studies, but due to an apparent instrument failure, it was unavailable. The original BICEP2 report was questioned at the time of publication for ignoring the implication of space dust on the findings, and the original authors themselves tempered their findings in a revised paper. In an email quoted by The New York Times, Raphael Flauger of Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study said the new report's findings made it seem ""clear that at least the majority of the signal is caused by dust."" Princeton's Paul J. Steinhardt called for the BICEP2 report to be retracted. The new report doesn't dismiss the previous findings outright But the scientists using the Planck satellite were careful to specify that while dust might have led to inaccurate results, it doesn't mean the BICEP2 team's hypothesis is incorrect. Jonathan Aumont, one of the report's authors, says that his team's work ""does not imply that [the BICEP2 team] did not measure at all a cosmological signal."" Aumont says BICEP2 and Plank use ""very different observation techniques and signal processing,"" and that he cannot say how much of the signal reported in March was produced by dust, and how much by the birth cries of our baby universe. The scientists using the Planck data emphasized the need for a joint analysis, and both teams are set to combine their results by the end of the year. In the meantime, it's going to be tough to tell Stanford professor Andrei Linde about the new report's findings. Linde, a major proponent of Inflation theory whose jubilant response to the original BICEP2 report was captured on film, said in March that hoped the apparent discovery of the gravitational waves was not a trick.

The company has started rolling out product and place pages that allows users to discover and purchase items within the service, Twitter said in a blog post Friday. The new pages will organize related tweets about products and brands on dedicated pages. If you look at a product page, you'll see other users' tweets about that product, prices, and, sometimes, a buy button. As you can see in the image below, if you were to look at the publishing company Penguin Random House's Twitter profile, you could redirect to a product page for Andy Weir's novel The Martian. You could then read what other people were tweeting about the book, and decide if you wanted to buy it, which you could do directly from the product page. Retailers can choose if they want to sell on the service or link out to an alternate page.     The company is also rolling out what it's calling Collections — a way for brands and celebrities to curate products and recommend them to followers. Demi Lovato, Reese Witherspoon, and Nike are just a few of the 41 partners that have curated collections for the service so far. The Collections feature seems to be more about browsing — window shopping, if you will — while product pages are aimed at providing information. Last year, Twitter unveiled a ""Buy"" button to users, but the one-click purchasing option was only available on some promoted tweets. The implementation of product and place pages seems to be part of an effort to get users to think of Twitter as a shopping destination, and as a resource for information about the products they're interested in buying. Window shopping on Twitter This is the second new feature Twitter has unveiled this week. On Thursday, the service announced it was building Project Lightning, a news platform that would allow users to follow events instead of people.

Investors are watching closely for the impact of the recent Comcast deal Netflix's stock price is currently wavering around $344, well off the high of $454 it posted this March. But that is part of a larger trend among tech stocks, which have been punished in recent weeks, pushing down the NASDQ exchange. This is largely due to investors taking profits before being hit with any earnings-season surprises, and isn't indicative of a real slowdown in the Netflix fundamentals. Investors will be watching very closely to see if they can gauge the financial impact of the deal Netflix struck this quarter with Comcast, in which it agreed to pay for direct interconnection. Speed and performance had both been degrading on Comcast for some time, but the trend sharply reversed after this deal was completed, and Netflix recorded a 65 percent speed increase on Comcast.  Netflix didn't alter its guidance for this quarter after announcing the Comcast deal, indicating that it wouldn't take a heavy financial hit. But since it has yet to strike a similar bargain with AT&T and Verizon, the other big ISPs in the US, the overall drag of these kinds of paid connection deals is a major question mark for Netflix's fiscal health in the future. While it wasn't explicit, the company did cite the need to improve streaming as one of its reasons for the planned price hike. Hastings also took time in his shareholder letter to again voice his opposition to the proposed Comcast-Time Warner Cable merger. More Netflix customers are sticking with the service Overall Netflix has now become the number one online video site, passing YouTube, which had long held the top spot.

Tucked into modules with names like ""around the web"" or ""you might like,"" there she is, demonstrating her bosom or backside or pearly-white smile. Often she is a celebrity, talking about weight loss, filing a lawsuit, or collapsing onstage. Other times she is a fitness guru, or a fashion expert, or (in at least one case) a ""former pole vaulter"" who is ""still smoking HOT."" The women of ""Around the Web"" are ubiquitous, they are alluring, and they only want one thing — your click. To finish an article on the web today is to immediately enter the desperate, and strangely tedious, world of ""content discovery."" Eager to keep visitors on their websites for as long as possible, publishers have long built widgets filled with links for their readers to consider. But increasingly, those links are pointing away from their own sites to titillating items from other publishers, many of whom have something to sell. Readers are clicking, publishers are reaping millions, and the startups that power these modules are profitable and on the cusp of becoming public companies. But there’s reason to believe ""Around the Web""-style links won’t be with us forever. Very interesting real estate Over the past few years, paid links like these have popped up on some of the biggest sites of the web: CNN, Fox News, MSNBC, USA Today, and Huffington Post, to name a few. And those are just the sites that use Outbrain and Taboola, the leading players in the field. Outbrain, an eight-year-old company that has raised $99 million, is reportedly in the early stages of planning an initial public offering of its stock. Taboola, which began as a way of recommending videos and has since expanded into web links, has raised $40 million and says it is profitable. ""The way these started was with this realization that people were more likely to click on a ‘related story’ than a banner ad — even if it’s advertising content,"" says Shane Snow, vice president of content at Contently, which among other things helps brands develop advertorials. ""So that became very interesting real estate."" But as ""Around the Web""-style widgets have become ubiquitous, their style has been widely imitated, so that the average reader has no idea what they might find when they follow a link. Clicking on that beautiful woman might lead you to an interesting story, to a thinly disguised advertisement, or to an infinitely scrolling landing page filled with weaponized clickbait, designed to get you to open as many tabs as possible. Companies like Outbrain use cookies to track your clicks over time in an effort to learn your preferences and serve you stories that you’ll actually like. It also maintains editorial standards designed to keep pure advertisements out of its modules. But as less scrupulous competitors ape their style, readers are likely to start tuning out article recommendations in the same way they learned to tune out banner ads. ""It’s our number one challenge,"" says Lisa LaCour, vice president of global marketing at Outbrain. So what if the Around the Web girls all went away? Would anyone really miss them? Publishers, for their part, have a vested interest in making sure the girls stick around. There’s a simple reason for the sudden ubiquity of the Around the Web link: cash. Outbrain, Taboola, and their peers have a simple pitch for the sites they work with: add our modules to your site for free, with just a few lines of code, and start making money immediately from the traffic you deliver to paying partners. ""Our whole pitch to publishers is a no-brainer,"" LaCour says. Adam Singolda, co-founder and CEO of Taboola, says top journalistic outlets are making more than $10 million a year adding its modules to their sites — significant revenues in an industry still struggling to find its footing online. 150 billion links a month And people are clicking. Fainthearted readers may still feel disoriented finishing a smart piece of reporting only to encounter ""15 hot celebs who dress too scandalously,"" as I did recently, but we seem to be in the minority. Singolda says that 70 percent of people who clicked on a Taboola link this month clicked on at least one other Taboola link the past 90 days, which he takes as an encouraging sign. Then there’s the sheer scale of the clicking: Taboola says it serves 3.5 billion recommendations a month, to 300 million people. Outbrain is used on more than 100,000 sites, and recommends 150 billion links a month. But publishers don’t seem eager to discuss their adventures in content discovery. I asked Outbrain and Taboola to speak with one of their publishing partners about their growing enthusiasm for recommended links, but all of them declined. It seems possible that publishers themselves remain unconvinced of the long-term value of the Around the Web girls. ""Our view of them is that these guys are the Groupons of publishing — it’s a really good short-term hack,"" says Ryan Singel, co-founder of Contextly, which sells module technology to publishers that recommend only internal links. ""Sending people off your site for three cents a click to sites you can’t control — that’s not what is going to work in the long term. The future of native advertising isn’t going to be sending people off your site, it’s going to be having that content living on your site."" The Around the Web folks take another view. Once upon a time, a reader might come to a site like the Huffington Post through its home page and scroll down hunting for links. These days, that reader is much more likely to come to an individual story page through a link from email, social media, or a search engine. In that world, they say, publishers have to advertise their best stories on other publishers’ sites. ""People are navigating the web site to site now, and not up and down,"" says Outbrain’s LaCour. ""We’ve got to get better at personalization, but what we want to say is, ‘Hey Casey, we know what you want. We know about you, we know about your reading habits, we know what you want to consume. So here are our recommendations for what we think is best.’"" The shrill seductions of the supermarket tabloid It’s a pitch that would be more persuasive had one of these recommendations ever showed me something I wanted to see. While chatting with LaCour, I pulled up a page at random on the website of New York Magazine and read her Outbrain’s suggested stories: the aforementioned hot pole vaulter, ""celebs who fell in love with people who didn’t love them back,"" and ""22 ‘used to be’ hot celebs who aren’t anymore."" The superior journalism and refined editorial sensibility of New York had given way to the shrill seductions of the supermarket tabloid. LaCour fired back with the recommendations OutBrain had given her, and they were much better targeted: stories about New York, about being a mom, and about real estate — all topics close to her heart, and some presumably from genuine publications. The secret, LaCour says, is that she clicked on enough Outbrain links to teach its algorithms what she likes. But who has the time or inclination to teach a widget? Meanwhile, the success of companies like Outbrain have led to proliferation of less savory recommendation engines. Companies like Hexagram and Crowd Ignite make widgets where the recommended links lead not to the stories you expected but to landing pages full of other stories, with a goal of getting you to stay and click through multiple stories before you leave. These so-called link exchanges don’t always involve direct payment — they’re just a way for publishers to attract new visitors. But chances are you won’t know what you’re getting before you click. Today, a single-digit percentage of readers will click through a link in an ""Around the Web"" module, compared to 0.1 percent who will click on a traditional banner ad. But banner ads once had high clickthrough rates themselves. Over time, readers learned that banners rarely led to anything good. At Outbrain and companies like it, there’s an existential fear that their own products could suffer a similar fate. Speaking of the company’s ideal customer, LaCour says: ""We want to make sure that she’s happy and she’s delighted. If we as an industry continue to try to clickbait her, and she’s not happy after she clicked, then we’re all screwed."" (LaCour says Outbrain strives to recommend only high-quality links.) ""How do you get increases in revenue? You show babes."" But it seems just as likely that a handful of rotten apples will eventually spoil the bunch. ""The problem is, you make more money when you show a risqué link,"" says Reggie Renner, co-founder and CEO of ZergNet, a kind of link exchange where human editors select all of the recommendations. ""You make more money, you get more short-term benefit. When it’s time to IPO, you need to show increases in revenue. And how do you get increases in revenue? You show babes."" Notably, everyone I interviewed described their companies not as link purveyors but as technology platforms that will prove invaluable to publishers over time. The modules are just the beginning, they insist — in the future, the data they have collected about readers’ habits can be turned into all sorts of useful products and services for their publisher clients. In the meantime, though, here are some beautiful women to look at. They’d appreciate your click.",0.4413270048714111,0.5586729951285889,0.8237043229878717,1623,4.9408502772643255,760,6.2276315789473689,0,0,"Business, Culture, Tech, Web, Report",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

Its CEO, Jack Dorsey, was being called the next Steve Jobs and bankers were reportedly salivating at the prospect of taking it public. But in the last few months its prospects seemed to have soured, at least according to the press. A recent report from the Wall Street Journal said that Square is running low on money and engaged in talks with multiple companies about possibly getting acquired. Its CEO was being called the new Steve Jobs So is the situation really that dire? Square has vehemently denied that it’s looking to sell, both to the WSJ and in a discussion with The Verge. While that particular detail is in dispute, there are a few salient facts about Square that might help to explain why it's suddenly being framed as a troubled startup getting shopped around. Early this month Square took on $100 million in debt funding from Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and JP Morgan Chase. Banks are typically late-stage investors when it comes to tech startups. They are happy to extend a loan like this to a company that will soon greatly increase its valuation, either through another round of financing or an IPO. Facebook and Twitter both raised debt before going public. Debt financing can also be a bad sign, however. When Foursquare took on $41 million in debt it was seen as evidence that the company was struggling to attract new investment without deflating its valuation, not that it was about to offer an IPO. So it makes sense when the WSJ reports that ""during the first quarter of 2014, a Square executive told a potential acquirer that the company had nine months before it would hit a predetermined 'cushion' of funds set aside as a last resort."" That would mean Square likely has nine months of venture funding left before it digs into its $100 million in credit. While the WSJ casts this as a bad sign, for a startup to have between one and two years of runway before it runs out of cash is fairly typical. Profits aren't necessary in the bizzaro world of startups All of this assumes of course that Square isn’t profitable, something Dorsey has admitted publicly, but again that’s not necessarily a negative in the bizzaro universe of high growth tech startups. Plenty of companies, from Twitter to Box, have gone public or announced IPOs without any profits to speak of. Even Amazon, a well established tech titan with massive annual revenues, often invests in growth to the point where it produces little or no profits. While Square processes billions of dollars for merchants each year, Square has very thin margins on this revenue. Every time customers swipe their credit card through a Square reader, whether it's at a flea market or a Starbucks, Square takes a 2.75 percent fee on the cost of the transaction. But 70–80 percent of that ends up going to the credit card companies and toward fraud prevention, leaving Square with less than 1 percent of gross revenues. Even if it was processing $10 billion a year, in other words, Square would get to keep less than $100 million. The margins on Square's core business are razor thin Though those thin margins are an issue, the major problem for Square seems to be that it’s struggling to grow the side of its business that could one day be quite profitable. Square has been trying to break into the higher-margin business of consumer services. It launched its Square Wallet App, which lets people pay with their phones, and it rolled out Square Cash, which makes it easy for people to transfer money to their friends or family. So far, however, neither of those have found mass adoption. That brings us back to the rumors of an acquisition. Payments is a two-sided market: to succeed, a company needs both merchants and customers on the same system. Square has done a good job attracting small merchants and proved that it's capable of handling a customer as big as Starbucks. It’s been less successful getting consumers to use its wallet app. Square is  good fit for a tech titan with cash to spare Big players like Apple or Google, both of whom were reportedly considering purchasing Square, have a ton of consumers using their phones, consumers who have already shared their credit card numbers. Acquiring Square would mean that apps like Google Wallet or some future version of Passbook would suddenly work in many more stores. So it’s not surprising these companies are at least making overtures about possibly acquiring it. In today’s startup environment, it can be hard to judge a company’s health. Square has taken on debt, lacks profits, and is being discussed as a possible acquisition by some of the bigger companies in tech. Six months ago those signals meant it was preparing for an IPO. Today they're interpreted as signs of a struggling company looking to sell. Either way, as is so often the case with high-flying startups, it needs a dramatic win to get its public narrative moving in the right direction again.",0.45144702662539227,0.5485529733746077,0.8024376511266721,875,4.7668571428571429,462,5.7857142857142856,0,0,"Business, Tech, Report",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

This view is, of course, no surprise: Netflix has already been pressured by Comcast into paying what it views as a net-neutrality violating fee in order to improve streaming service to its subscribers, and it's certainly fearful that it'll have to pay more of these down the road and that Comcast could even eventually come to directly compete on streaming with a service of its own.  ""Comcast could control high-speed broadband to the majority of American homes."" ""If the Comcast and Time Warner Cable merger is approved, the combined company’s footprint will pass over 60 percent of US broadband households,"" Netflix writes, noting that this figure includes Comcast's proposed divestiture of equipment that would bring it down to serving just 30 percent of the US market after the deal closed. Netflix says that with the decline of DSL, ""Comcast could control high-speed broadband to the majority of American homes."" As a household name and a common example of internet success, Netflix's view on the potential merger of major internet service providers certainly carries some weight. Senator Al Franken even specifically called on Netflix CEO Reed Hastings to deliver his opinion on the deal, noting that he was ""uniquely positioned to gauge the risks."" Franken now has his answer. Netflix is already concerned with Comcast's abilities to push it around as it is — if the deal goes through, it'll have even more to worry about. But despite his company's strong issues with Comcast and the proposed purchase, Hastings did have kind things to say about how Comcast would manage should the merger go through. ""Brian Roberts is incredibly thoughtful,"" he said of Comcast Corporation's CEO during a call with investors. ""I'd say if there's anyone that you wanted to trust with controlling half of the US internet, you might pick Brian Roberts. He's very thoughtful, very long term about it, very reasonable."" ""But I don't know that we want anybody to control half of the US internet,"" Hastings added. ""That's the real basis of our objection to the merger."" Comcast, of course, takes offense to the idea that it might be violating net neutrality in any way, issuing a press release that objects to Netflix's remarks: ""Netflix's opposition to our Time Warner Cable transaction is based on inaccurate claims and arguments.  There has been no company that has had a stronger commitment to openness of the Internet than Comcast and we are the only ISP in the country that is currently legally bound by the FCC's vacated net neutrality rules. In fact, one of the many benefits of our proposed transaction with Time Warner Cable will be the extension of Net Neutrality protections to millions of additional Americans."" Comcast accuses Netflix of unfairly singling it out when other companies like Google and Yahoo also pay for better connections between subscribers and content. The company also reiterates its position that there would still be competition in the ISP market if the deal goes through, relying on the shaky logic that expensive cellular data plans and nacent upstarts like Google Fiber can count as meaningful competition for the might of a combined Comcast and Time Warner Cable. ""Netflix should be transparent that its opinion is not about protecting the consumer or about net neutrality,"" writes Comcast.  ""Rather, it's about improving Netflix's business model by shifting costs that it has always borne to all users of the Internet and not just to Netflix customers.""

Preston-Werner was not explicitly named until now. However, most people had figured out that he was the ""co-founder"" referred to by former developer Julie Ann Horvath, who quit last month due to what she says had become a hostile work environment. Horvath claimed to have experienced sexism and gender-based harassment at GitHub. She also spoke out about Preston-Werner and his wife, who she says personally harassed her for two years, the former berating her in his office and the latter stalking her at work. According to Horvath, the Preston-Warners were apparently concerned that she would undermine the company's reputation, perhaps due to her outspokenness on the issues around women in tech. CEO Chris Wanstrath was vague about what the investigation turned up. There was no legal wrongdoing but ""the investigator did find evidence of mistakes and errors of judgment,"" he writes. ""In light of these findings, Tom has submitted his resignation, which the company has accepted."" ""The investigation found no evidence to support the claims against Tom and his wife."" When asked exactly what happened between Horvath and the Preston-Werners, GitHub responded that the details of the investigation are confidential. However, the episode has clearly made a big impact at the company. ""We are implementing a number of new HR and employee-led initiatives as well as training opportunities to make sure employee concerns and conflicts are taken seriously and dealt with appropriately,"" Wanstrath writes. ""We know we still have work to do."" When asked for comment, Preston-Werner directed The Verge to his blog post about resigning, where he strongly denies that he and his wife engaged in gender-based discrimination. ""I believe in diversity and equality for all people in all professions, especially the tech sector,"" he writes. ""Unfortunately, the investigation and all the attention surrounding it have me concerned that remaining at GitHub would be a distraction for both me and the company."" ""GitHub would bleed good employees if he didn't resign."" Preston-Warner was CEO of GitHub until January, when he became president and Wanstrath became CEO. Inspired by the Oculus Rift, he says he wants to do something with immersive computing next. For the immediate future, he's moving to New York to help his wife with her startup, Omakase, which assists technology-centered nonprofits. ""He didn't have a choice,"" Horvath tells The Verge.

Yet, few startups have really tried to improve it — perhaps because the mattress business isn’t exactly the sexiest industry around. Buying a mattress will never be like buying an iPhone. The archetypal smarmy mattress store salesman is nothing like an Apple Store Genius. But Krim, the CEO of ""sleep startup"" Casper, doesn’t see how the two are so different. You spend a third of your life sleeping on a mattress, which is probably also in line with the amount of time you spend on your smartphone. All the while, you drop hundreds of dollars on a phone every two years, but mattresses are a considered to be a pricey purchase, even when you only buy one every five or more years. But it’s hard to blame consumers, Krim says, since mattress stores are downright terrible. He decided to start his own company selling premium mattresses on the web, for half the cost of competitors. Casper’s first mattress goes on sale today.   ""Statistically, lying on a bed for four minutes has no correlation to whether it’s the right bed for you,"" says Krim, citing leading mattress reviews site Sleep Like The Dead. But even if they were correlated, he’s convinced that most mattress stores are selling people the wrong beds. He wants to expose the showroom fallacy pervading mattress stores across the country. ""We looked at the hotel industry, where they don’t ask you what kind of bed you need, and in general people love sleeping on hotel beds,"" he says. ""We always knew about the games retailers play with having eight gradients of firmness — that’s part of how they guide you through the showroom towards something more expensive and more comfortable."" ""Statistically, lying on a bed for four minutes has no correlation to whether it’s the right bed for you."" The most comfortable beds at the mattress store quite likely also cost the most to produce, but Krim’s convinced that he can produce a similar quality mattress for much cheaper. After reflecting on his experiences selling mattresses at his father’s e-commerce company and testing dozens of designs, Krim and co settled on a ""medium-firm,"" 10-inch-deep bed that has a bottom layer of less expensive foam, a midsection of Tempur Pedic-esque memory foam, and a top layer of latex foam. For the final testing phases, Casper even lent some beds to local New York City Airbnb hosts and got feedback on how renters liked them. Casper mattresses are vacuum-packed for shipping, and inflate over a course of two to three hours. Latex mattress often cost over $1500, but Casper’s mattresses cost between $500 for a twin-sized mattress and $950 for a king-sized mattress. You could attribute this price differential in part to the notoriously high markups in the mattress industry — markups which Krim says he has cut out by breaking down the supply chain and sourcing manufacturers one by one. Casper also cut costs by not dealing with resellers and showrooms. Thus, he says, Casper isn’t as much about creating a new mattress as much as it is about bringing what he claims is the best mattress technology to the masses for the first time. ""Latex is the greatest sleep material out there, but it hasn’t been popularized in the US really — there’s no big company trying to sell the benefits to consumers,"" he says. ""You can build something that’s universally supportive and comfortable for 99 percent of people out there."" ""We always knew about the games retailers play."" Setting aside Casper’s supportive beds, convincing the average American to splurge on a web-based, one-size-fits-all model will be challenging. Fortunately, some of the work has already been done there. Tuft & Needle, another mattress startup that offers a similar to Casper, has the No 1-rated mattress on Amazon. Both companies offer free delivery and returns on all mattresses within a 30-day period. Tuft & Needle foam beds are a few hundred dollars cheaper than Casper’s, but also don’t include latex foam. A competing mattress from Tuft & Needle. The global mattress market is expected to hit $24.65 billion by 2017, Casper says, and memory foam mattresses are the market’s fastest growing segment, despite having less than 25 percent market share.

AT&T's influence is obvious: the company has a nationwide presence with over 110 million wireless subscribers and over 16 million broadband customers.

""Combining our expertise in network infrastructure, mobile, broadband and video with The Chernin Group’s management and expertise in content, distribution, and monetization models in online video creates the opportunity for us to develop a compelling offering in the OTT space,"" said John Stanley, AT&T's chief strategy officer. It's too early to know what the upcoming service will look like — especially since it may be pieced together through numerous acquisitions. It could be a straightforward Netflix and Hulu competitor, or the companies may share bigger ambitions and decide to build out an over-the-top cable competitor, perhaps with AT&T's U-verse branding.

Today the company released some of its findings of an investigation into the attacks, saying that malware was found in 113 of its US stores, and may have affected purchases at those locations made between August 10th, 2014 and September 16th, 2014. Staples added that at two stores, the malicious software could have been running unseen for even longer, dating all the way back to late-July. Attackers could have accessed card names and numbers Staples says it removed the malware from its systems back in mid-September, and has since bolstered its security with newer encryption tools. That didn't stop attackers from potentially getting customer credit card numbers, verification codes, expiration dates, and full cardholder names before those extra measures were added. Staples says it plans to offer free identity protection services to customers that shopped at those stores with their cards, including credit monitoring and identify theft insurance. Besides the malware issue, Staples disclosed what it says were ""reports of fraudulent payment card use"" at four of its stores in Manhattan, but said that there was no malware or ""suspicious activity"" at those locations. Nonetheless, the company says it's also erring on the side of caution, and offering similar identity protection to people who shopped there as well. This breach is tiny compared to Target and The Home Depot Staples acknowledged the potential of a breach back in October, saying it was beginning its own investigation into the matter. That was preceded by a dispatch from cyber security expert Brian Krebs, who reported ""a pattern of credit and debit card fraud,"" that had been picked up on by several East Coast banking sources, and was believed to be tied to point-of-sale malware. Both the number of stores, as well as the potential list of affected cards is quite low compared to high-profile retail security breaches that occurred in the past year or so. The one on Target last December claimed 40 million credit and debit cards, as well as the personal information of approximately 110 million Target shoppers, something that's led to to a lawsuit from consumers against the retail giant.

That's a big deal, because networks aren't required to negotiate with most companies in the same way that they negotiate with cable and satellite providers. If this proposal goes into effect, any company that wants to offer TV shows over the internet will have the same negotiating powers to do so as a traditional TV provider would, meaning that internet TV providers could finally get off the ground. FCC chairman Tom Wheeler announced his intention to propose this back in October, writing that ""21st century consumers shouldn’t be shackled to rules that only recognize 20th century technology."" Under this new proposal, any company using any technology to broadcast video streams would have the ability to license content owned by cable and broadcast networks. In effect, the commission is just expanding the rules that Congress once used to give satellite TV providers a leg up — and it's clear that that effort worked.

The network has been teasing the interview all day — here's the relevant snippet: ""There are a number of options open to us, and we have considered those and are considering those. As it stands right now, while there have been a number of suggestions... there has not been one major VOD distributor [or] one major e-commerce site that has stepped forward and said they're willing to distribute this movie for us...

At that time we had no alternative not to proceed with the theatrical release on December 25th. We have not caved, we have not given in, we have persevered and we have not backed down. We have always had every desire to have the American public to see this movie."" According to a tweet from Zakaria, the interview wrapped up after Obama's press conference. What isn't discussed, at least in this teaser, is when or how Sony Pictures would release the the film. More so, the focus here feels like Lynton shifting more blame on the theaters for the canceled premiere. In a later teaser, Lynton reacted to Obama's comment that he wished Sony had reached out to them. ""We definitely spoke to a senior advisor in the White House to talk about the situation. The fact is, did we talk to the president himself? ... The White House was certainly aware of the situation."" (Even CNN's on-air anchor described that answer as ""muddled."")

""For people who have just discovered me via TNGHT, it's gonna be, 'The fuck is this?'"" Ross Birchard, the 29-year-old Scottish producer better known as Hudson Mohawke, is nearing the release of his second full-length solo album, Lantern (out June 16th on Warp.) It's an adventurous, at times impressionistic departure from the club bombast he's built his name on, and includes some real capital-S songs with vocalists like Antony and Miguel. And he's fully aware and candid about how the festival kids might take it. But when I spoke to him at the Tribeca Grand Hotel in New York, he was even more anxious about the debut of the Lantern live show in 24 hours at Irving Plaza — a full live band performance featuring Two Door Cinema Club drummer Ben Thompson and British musician Redinho on keyboard. It was a riskier, more labor-intensive way to debut his new material, but something he says it was important he take his time to get right. And at this point, Birchard knows how to take his time — perhaps better than one would expect from a producer known for his straight-for-the-jugular bangers. It's been six years since his exhilaratingly playful debut album Butter, and he's been DJing since the age of 15. But the last three years have been a lurch into hyperspeed — getting the Kanye West stamp of approval will do that for you. Birchard, who is signed to West's G.O.O.D. Music as a producer, provided the signature horn-throttle of Yeezus' ""Blood on the Leaves"" as well as 2012 Song of the Year contender ""Mercy,"" off the G.O.O.D. compilation Cruel Summer. But it was his collaboration with Canadian producer Lunice as TNGHT — the duo largely credited for the rise of the now-ubiquitous EDM Trap sound — that made him a festival tent staple. Talking to Birchard, it's clear that sound is a blip in the big scheme of his goals as a producer, albeit a very enjoyable blip. Birchard refers to tracks — even some of his biggest, most recognizable hits — as ""songs"": ""The 'Kettles' song,"" ""The 'Chimes' song,"" ""The 'Mercy' song."" It's an endearing bit of linguistic downplay, but also speaks to the huge catalog of music in his head and his near-constant perspective checking about the realities of the music industry and his place within it. I spoke to Birchard about playing the long game, never-ending squabbles for credit, and how to, in his words, ""make 10,000 people fucking go into a mosh pit or some shit like that.""   I think it's safe to say that the majority of your audience in the states has found you via Kanye West. Do you feel like there's a big difference between how people have discovered you here versus in the UK, and thus what's expected of you? Yeah, I guess — it's just the way of the world. If I'm booked to play somewhere in the UK or a European festival or something like that, even just DJing, people are aware. Whereas [when I play in the US], maybe I haven't really done the sort of groundwork out here to build a full profile. But that's what this show is about, and that's what having this new record is about, because I feel a lot of people came across me just via TNGHT, particularly in the US. I can't remember who it was, but some reasonably high-profile magazine the other day was talking about me gearing up to release my first debut album. And I'm like, ""My debut album came out like six years ago."" Yeah, and journalists and writers can still get very stuck on the idea of an album as being this legitimizing body of work. But you've been plenty busy since Butter — so what made you want to do another full-length album all these years later? And how is the approach different, compared to doing an EP or a one-off track?  There's something about EPs where you're less precious about it, because it's just ""Get this out,"" or maybe [it's a way to release] some of these songs we banked for like a year or two. But as far as a full-length record, that's in your discovery feed forever; you don't want 10 years down the line to be like, ""What the fuck did I do that for?"" Is it that much different? It all ends up on the same Spotify page or Soundcloud feed. Of course, but as far as something setting together as one succinct project, I wanted this new record to just represent a full range of my tastes — rather than just make a record of club songs, which I'd be happy to do, but not necessarily on a full-length record.   Musically, what were you able to get into on this album that you'd been missing in the last few years? I think just melody. This is also one of the reasons why we decided to release the Chimes record before this record. That's the reason why that song isn't included on this record — obviously I really like that as a club song, a fast and loose song — but it's not necessarily something that I'd like want to put on a full-length album. So, it's getting more into what I see myself as — a more melodic, traditional producer — rather than like, ""I'll make a load of club bangers and just fucking do it."" It's not the last bit of [the club material], because I'm going to return to that; the TNGHT project will return to that. But as far as solo material, this project is something that I really wanted, specifically working with Antony, working with Miguel. It's a little bit more restrained, [compared to] the first record and the EPs. I think the track on Lantern that defines that for me is ""Kettles."" That big, exaggerated horn sound is such a part of what you're known for now. And ""Kettles"" uses that sound, but in a much more lush, orchestral context.  I think it was just more sort of me experimenting as far as what I really want to hear, as opposed to what's going to make 10,000 people fucking go into a mosh pit or some shit like that. Is that — the mosh pit thing — something you feel like you can target consciously at this point? Do you finish a track and think, ""Oh man, people are going to freak out to this?"" Or, ""Apple's gonna totally put this in a commercial?""  I mean, [""Chimes""] was made quite a while ago. The final version wasn't made until last year, but the original version of it was made in 2013 or something like that, so it was, I guess, it was before there was this sort of ""EDM trap"" thing. That sound wasn't as prevalent then, and I just sort of made it ... it wasn't really meant to be anything. It was just a sketch, sort of? Yeah. But again, I guess it's sort of those types of songs that end up becoming ones that people [latch on to].  Do you find it more challenging to work on something where there's not one specific goal or context for the music? Yeah, of course, it's more challenging for me. But having said that, I want it to be more challenging for me, because I can't fucking make another 10 ""Chimes"" songs. That's fun, and then what? I feel like if you're not really challenging yourself, what's the point of the whole thing? So that's another thing I was going for with this record — as you're saying, the ""Kettles"" song, it's the same palate of sounds, but it's not a club song or something like that. So how did you kind of take that approach when you were working with vocalists? How did you go about making a sound that's specific to Jhene Aiko, Antony, and your other guests? Well, a great deal of it is learning to not go over the top with the instrumentals in the first place. Because I've done a bunch [of tracks], I guess more so around the first record, where I wasn't yet in the situation of being able to go into the room with certain artists and play them music. So I was just sending stuff to the managers, and most of the feedback I was getting was ""this is too complicated, there's no space for anyone to sing on this."" So I think learning to have less going on and leaving space for vocals is something I've worked on learning over the last two or three years. You're working with artists who have very distinctive voices, too. There's sort of a tendency in mainstream EDM tracks to just throw any old vocalist in there, knowing the voice will be processed anyway. But it seems like you made the choice to bring in people who really sound like distinctive human beings. It was something that was a big consideration for me when picking the guests for the record because he was like, do you go for the big, huge A-list names? But potentially at the risk of the song coming out and basically [credited in the press as] their song, and not your song. So the people I picked to work with were people who I really admire and that I've been wanting to work with for a long time, but at the same time not people who would necessarily take away from the fact that it's my record, or collaborative song rather then it being like an A-list artist on my beat or something like that. Sometimes I feel like it can get a bit muddy with production and credit, too. There are tracks where I see your name in credits along songs with 10 other people, and it's not always clear what specific elements were ""yours."" It's a funny thing — I guess maybe this is something that is potentially my own fault for not putting my foot down more — but people will take credit for like, one word in a song or something like that, and other people will get an equivalent credit for doing like most of the song. And it's difficult, specifically within the hip-hop realm of things, everybody wants their credit whether they did one word or whether they spent five weeks. Obviously there's a lot of ego involved within the hip-hop world, so are you going to argue for your credit on such-and-such? A lot of people don't know that I was involved in the ""Mercy"" song in the first place. But a lot of people are listed in the credits, so unless you specifically go in the credits, you're not going to know that. And I'm not the sort of person on Twitter like, ""And I did this! And I did this!"" I'm just like, well, if you go on my discog, you can find out [what I've done]. But I'm not going to be shouting about it. Why not? Because I just don't really feel it's necessary! If people want to do the Googles, then... [Laughs]. But I don't want to — it's the same thing as not wanting to be the guy out in the street handing out demos and shit like that. It's just not me. Is that kind of also the reason why you're taking a break from a sort of traditional DJ-booth, ""I'm the boss"" show setup? Yeah, the last two shows, Chicago and the Movement Festival in Detroit, were DJ shows, and I still love doing that. But you know, as far as credits on major label stuff, I feel like it's more [about] sort of building yourself up the ladder. It's really more about cutting your teeth within that world to the point where your managers don't have to get into a chain of 10,000 emails about where you get credited. I don't fucking care about that. You prove it yourself with your work. And as I said, I've only been involved in that sort of level of things for maybe two or three years. I think 2012 was the first major label thing I was involved in, and in that period there have been so many people who were tipped to be the next fucking massive thing, and just disappeared. So I'm just working my way toward it. So you've completed this kind of solo vision quest with Lantern, but you've been involved with the new Kanye album, and you're continuing your work producing for other artists. Do you like the continual change of pace, or is there a way you prefer to work? Previously, my preferred mode was working entirely alone, in like, the middle of the night. But now I really feel like I've flourished more in the collaborative environment, because I certainly have the tendency, if I'm working on my own, to sit and go overboard and just work forever and be like, ""Oh, it's not good enough! It's not good enough!"" Whereas, if you work with a bunch of people, it's much easier to [let things go]. ""It might be fucking terrible. But it's something that I wanted to try."" I guess one of my first experiences like that was doing the TNGHT project because the whole thing came together so quickly — we were really like, ""Okay, we just made three songs in three hours."" And it was more about the atmosphere and the vibe of the working environment versus [stressing over] ""how can I make this better?"" And it's more of a hands-on thing as well, because one person is on the keyboard here, another person is working there. It's more organic because you have more ""mistakes"" that end up becoming part of the song that weren't planned for — you just kind of fuck around, and all of a sudden it becomes part of the song. It's the same for the new live set that we've been working on, because we have all the individual parts of the song, and we can sort of deconstruct them and build them into something new. And everybody has their own input. And do you think this is going to be kind of the show that you're going to be doing for a while now? Well, I'm still doing the DJ shows at the same time, and I'm not going to stop doing the DJ shows because they're still so much fun, but in terms of challenging myself creatively, this is something that I wanted to move toward. It might be fucking terrible. But it's something that I wanted to try.",0.6379942622079622,0.3620057377920378,0.15644492486468362,2462,4.3696181965881395,836,5.8552631578947372,0,4,"Culture, Entertainment, Music, Report",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Remember Fake Steve Jobs? During his time as Forbes tech editor, Lyons created The Secret Diary of Steve Jobs in 2006, pretty much just as a way of understanding how to blog. It was funny and insightful, and it got people to pay attention. Pretty soon the site was earning 1.5 million visitors a month. To this day, the site remains one of Lyons’ best-known achievements. He’s since written for places like Valleywag and ReadWrite, and is a minor celebrity in the bubble that is tech media. It even landed him a writing gig on Silicon Valley, whose second season finale airs on Sunday. Lyons insists the whole thing was just a crazy accident, though — yet another happy circumstance in a life spent just trying things out. Lyons is currently in the middle of writing a book titled Disrupted: My Misadventure in the Startup Bubble, which sounds like the next natural leap from working on TV. I spoke with Lyons this week ahead of Sunday’s finale to ask how he wound up at HBO, his new book, and what it’s like being the real Fake Steve Jobs.  How did you end up in the job? In 2010, I had a novel about my Fake Steve blog, and the novel was called Options, and I sold the rights to the book to a company called Media Rights Capital in LA. They teamed me up with a guy named Larry Charles who had worked on Curb Your Enthusiasm and Seinfeld, and we created a show called Icon, which we shopped around and sold to the Epix cable network. Then we spent the next 18 months writing scripts, but then in the end Epix decided not to make any shows. Then, when Silicon Valley was picked up by HBO, the original showrunners left the show right after the pilot was made. HBO brought in this other guy named Alec Berg. Alec had worked on Curb and on Seinfeld, so he went way back with Larry Charles, and Larry said to him, ""Oh, you should talk to Dan."" He showed Alec some of my old scripts and said, ""This guy really knows Silicon Valley really well."" [So] I get this call from my agent, saying, ""Completely weird thing, but HBO just called and asked if you would come work on a show for the summer?"" The thing that's always struck me about it was that I was really heartbroken in 2010 when the Icon show got dropped. I just was kind of crushed, but then weirdly enough something good came out of it. It was one of those stories when people say you never know where things are taking you. Speaking of you knowing a lot about how Silicon Valley works, how did you wind up becoming Fake Steve Jobs? Well, here's the thing. I wouldn't say that I know a lot about Silicon Valley. I live in Boston, for one thing. And I don't live and breathe this stuff the way most of the guys out there do. I was working at Forbes, and I covered big enterprise companies — IBM, Sun, and EMC — and it was kind of boring. Forbes only came out every other week, so it was not the most fast-paced job in the world. It was very nice, comfortable. I wanted to learn how to blog, so I was playing around with Wordpress and Typepad and Blogger, starting all these different blogs just to learn how these things work. I had a fake Sergey Brin blog, an anonymous, fake Ph.D kind of blog. I did it for like, I don't know, six weeks, and the Steve Jobs one just caught on. I don't know why. I think someone saw it, and passed it on to someone else, and someone else saw it. It was like a practical joke that got out of control. In fact, originally I was working on a novel in my spare time, and I kept thinking, ""I'd better drop this stupid blog and get back to my novel."" And then I realized it was probably more interesting than the novel. Then the blog became a novel, then it became a TV show, and that TV show led to Silicon Valley. It was just that one random decision to do that one stupid blog [that] led to all these other things. So could you walk me through a day of you being a staff writer at Silicon Valley? I learned a lot, but basically... there are 10 writers on the show, but that includes Alec Berg and Mike Judge. So Alec and Mike and then eight writers and a couple of assistants. So you go in every day at like 11, and from 11 to like 6 or 7 we just sat around a big conference table. And we shot the shit all day, and we had whiteboards all over the wall. So  usually Alec or Mike, would be up at the whiteboard, break out beats, and be like, ""Okay, let's have a storyline"" and often you'd spend a whole day and fill up a whiteboard and be like, ""Fuck. No,"" and just erase the whole thing. It was kind of a grueling process. Basically, you just sit there and talk, and Alec might call on you and be like, ""Hey, what do you think would happen now?"" But more often than not it's just a conversation and you kind of have to jump in. I was the lowest-ranking person. The absolute lowest ranking of the 10 people in the room. You just have to try to get a word in edgewise. Alec would finally feel like he had an episode that was broken out sufficiently; he would go write a very detailed outline of that episode, and he would run it by HBO, and they’d send back notes; we'd go over it together; he'd do another draft; then he'd send it back to HBO, get notes from them, then have a finished outline draft. And then, since there were 10 of us on the show, we each got one writing credit. So I got episode 8. Just like ""Here, take the outline, go put this in script format. You can tinker around with it if you want."" I wasn't gonna mess with Alec Berg's work. He’s forgotten more about screenwriting then I'll ever know. And then they go and shoot it. So you’re working on a book — what's it about? I spent a little under two years working at a software company [HubSpot] in Cambridge, as they were ramping up to an IPO and through the IPO. It's a classic place with the foosball tables and the free beer and the dogs and all that shit. My prior stint at Newsweek was a very different world. So it's what it's like to be in one of these kooky software startups as a grown up. It's not entirely pleasant! It's like, ""Oh, I don't fit."" And I don't know about you, but as a reporter, I used to always cover these places and be like, ""Wow, these people seem to be having so much fun. This looks like a blast! So much more fun than being a reporter! You get free food!"" But now I'm not sure, I think if you're predisposed to being a journalist you're not really suited to do much else. What did you study in school? What kind of background lets you bounce around like you have? I went to a bunch of different colleges. I was kind of a bad student. I bounced around a lot and dropped out and then went back, but I ended up at this place called Bradford College, and my degree was a BA in Liberal Arts. After that I took an MFA in creative writing at the University of Michigan, and I wanted to be a novelist and teach at university. So I wrote a few books before the Fake Steve thing. I had written one collection of short stories and one novel that both got reviewed okay, but they didn't sell a lot. But that's what I really wanted to be. You know, those guys who teach creative writing and live in some college town. I thought that sounded like a really cool, ideal life. That never worked out. And all things considered, what is probably the strangest thing you've ever had to do for work? I first went to college to be a dentist. I was on a six-year dental program at Case Western Reserve, [and I] just completely fucked up. I dropped out, and I came home to Massachusetts, and I didn’t know what to do, so I worked in a textile mill. This place called Malden Mills, just this disgusting textile mill, and I did that for a couple years. And I liked it. I'd fix machinery. What's your best career advice to wind up where you've been? And where you are now? The thing I would say is that no one should take career advice from me, because I have fucked up my career in every way. [Laughs.] That's one thing. And on the other hand, I do think the lesson I learned from the Fake Steve thing was there was something I found and I couldn't stop even though I thought I should have. I had people telling me, ""You really need to stop before you get caught."" I think that was the first time in my life that I found something that was such a passion and was so crazy. I think if you find something like that, my advice to someone now is to just ride that. I wasn't making any money at Fake Steve. It wasn't paying me anything. I tell my kids (I have young kids) to try everything. What the hell? Try lots of different things, you never know what choice in life is the choice you want, and there's nothing wrong with not liking something and going, ""Oh, it was worth a try"". But I just sort of try to be open to new things. Like with the TV thing. I thought, ""Well, at the least it'll be like a free summer vacation for us,"" and we all went out to LA and had a good time, the kids went out to surf camp. It was fun. So that might be it.

Martin. I’ll always be grateful for that. As cliche as it sounds now, A Game of Thrones was high fantasy that expertly subverted the ideals and aesthetics of high fantasy, a genre that had driven me away with too much florid prose and Tolkien imitation. Its general excellence is enough to make me feel bad about wishing the series — in all its forms — had died a long time ago. A Game of Thrones explored what fantasy’s nostalgia-tinged conventions might actually produce in a world full of ordinary humans instead of mythic heroes. Dragons weren’t wondrous creatures, they were terrifying super-weapons — a friend at the time called them the ICBMs of the fantasy world. Courtly love and chivalry were the product of a rigid, bigoted hierarchy. Living as royalty in a feudal system meant accepting that all relationships, romantic ones especially, were transactional. And serving an ideal, instead of whoever happened to be in power, could get you killed. It wasn’t that the book was ""dark,"" or even revolutionary, it just shook up a set of tropes that I had spent years rolling my eyes at. Game of Thrones shook up a genre I generally hated After finishing it, I knew that I wanted more. I burned through A Clash of Kings and A Storm of Swords, which included some of my favorite sections of the series. It doesn’t come through quite as well in the show, but George R.R. Martin does a great job of conveying the sheer foreignness of Westeros, a world effectively run by children and old men following an archaic moral code. Like many people, though, I quickly internalized the golden rule of A Song of Ice and Fire: if you enjoy reading about a character, their days are probably numbered.   For a while, this risk genuinely made the series more interesting. But as I neared the end of the third book, it started to feel more like a required Song of Ice and Fire flourish than a useful narrative tool. Ironically, the tipping point was George R.R. Martin killing off perhaps the books’ most loathsome character. In a stand-alone story, it would have been shocking and satisfying. But all I could think about was the fact that I wasn’t even halfway through the series, and one of its biggest personalities was gone. George R.R. Martin killed off my least favorite character, and it was terrible One of my least favorite high fantasy conventions is what would charitably be known as the genre's epic scale. I don’t like knowing everything about a place, or everything that happens to a person. It makes it too easy for plots and characters to become vehicles for world-building, instead of compelling things in their own right. A Game of Thrones reinvented the overused mythos of medieval-tinged fantasy, but after enough time, the extensive family trees and the fight for the Iron Throne became constraints in their own right. When new characters showed up to replace the old ones, they ended up fitting awkwardly into stories that had been built around someone else.   After a while, I realized that I was more invested in A Song of Ice and Fire’s lore than in the actual books. I continued  because I needed to know what happened, but I didn’t really enjoy finding out. Following A Feast for Crows was a chore. I read Wikipedia instead of A Dance with Dragons. I stuck with the TV series for a while longer, but the same tipping point happened somewhere around the third season: for every moment I genuinely enjoyed, there was another that I only watched to check how it compared to the books. HBO wasn’t a TV network, it was a vending machine for my Westeros fix. HBO was a vending machine for my Westeros fix At some point around my initial Song of Ice and Fire binge, I started Martin’s The Armageddon Rag. In a way, it’s another weird, original take on Tolkien — a murder mystery about a journalist who uncovers the sinister plot behind a Led Zeppelin-esque fantasy-rock band. If Game of Thrones is what happens when noble myth meets human cruelty, Armageddon Rag is about 1960s idealism meeting 1980s cynicism. It’s great. When I finished it, I wondered for a moment what would happen next. I would probably have read a sequel. A sequel might even have been good. But I’m incredibly glad there wasn’t one. The longer A Song of Ice and Fire goes, the more I feel like I’m missing out on other interesting fictional experiments — especially ones from Martin himself. But every time someone mentions a character, I end up spending 20 minutes clicking through A Wiki of Ice and Fire, trying to figure out what’s going on in a series I’ve all but abandoned. George R.R. Martin has managed to do what Tolkien never did: turn me into a desperate lore-hound for a world I’m fundamentally tired of visiting. Please. Someone.

According to The Hollywood Reporter the movie will be debuting in select theaters in 70mm on December 25th, Christmas Day. The standard release will follow on January 8th. The Hateful Eight has a certain amount of drama to its legacy thus far. A draft of the script leaked in early 2014, prompting Tarantino to sue Gawker and eventually call off the film entirely. Several months later he directed a staged reading of the screenplay in Los Angeles for a public crowd, and then eventually decided to make the movie after all. Then in April a teaser for the movie leaked, prompting more frustration and a bevy of takedown notices. Frankly, we just want to see the movie already. What's intriguing about this particular release plan, however, is the focus on film. Tarantino has long been an outspoken advocate for shooting and projecting film, turning the New Beverly Cinema in LA he purchased into a shrine to film projection. Much like Paul Thomas Anderson did with The Master, Tarantino shot The Hateful Eight in 65mm, and the Christmas Day release will be shown exclusively in the bigger format. This is going to drastically limit the number of theaters that will be able to show the film — if the number of theaters that still have film projectors is a small subset of the whole, the number with 70mm projectors is a smaller subset of that — but those who trek out to see the film right away will get to witness a medium with rich, lush colors that today's standard digital projectors simply can't match.

They are the type of gadget that can make you feel like you're living in the very near future, pumping tunes into your ear holes without having to be plugged into anything. There are a ton of wireless headphone options available, ranging from the horrible to the pretty great. This week, Plantronics (you may know them best for the oft-mocked Bluetooth headsets every business bro had jammed in their ear five or 10 years ago) released the BackBeat Sense, a riff on the wireless headphone that adds some useful smarts to an attractive and comfortable design. The $179.99 BackBeat Sense is on the more expensive end of on-ear headphones, but they have some really nice features such as well-padded memory foam ear cups, actual physical buttons to control playback and volume (as opposed to less reliable touch-based controls), an audio pass-through option to hear the world around you, and the ability to be connected to two different devices at the same time and switch between them. Plantronics says the Bluetooth radio in the Sense is strong enough to stream music up to 100 feet away, and the internal battery lasts up to 18 hours between charges. The headphones are also very lightweight and comfortable, making it easy to wear them for hours at a time. Automatic play and pause make these headphones smarter than others The Sense's smarts come into play with their ability to automatically pause or resume music when you put them on or take them off, or the ability to automatically route incoming calls to them when you put them on. Plantronics' Bluetooth headset experience comes into play with dual microphones that support HD Voice and the battery status meter that works on iOS and Android devices.   Of course, none of those features mean much if the Sense headphones sound like crap, but fortunately they sound just as good as the many other Bluetooth headphones in this price range. In the few days I've been testing them out, Bluetooth reliability was on par with the best of the field, with only rare instances of interference. Battery life was as good as advertised, as well. My only complaints with them are they don't fold up as compact as the Bose SoundLink on-ear, nor do they have any sort of active noise cancellation. (Noise cancellation isn't too common in this price range, but it would certainly be a nice thing to have.)

I had just finished cooking, cleaning, and setting the table, and there it was: Tap Tap. ""Time to stand!"" Activity tracking is one of the most exciting things that wearables and smartwatches can do for us. But it's also something that they still need to work at. When I got the Apple Watch, I was excited to measure how much (read: how little) I was moving each day, but its activity tracking has quickly turned into something entirely different for me.  Tap Tap That's because, Tap Tap, one big piece of the Apple Watch's activity tracker is kind of wonky. As in, it doesn't really work — but it also doesn't work with such incredible regularity that it actually helps me to tell the time. The Apple Watch is supposed to track three things each day: how long you've exercised, how many calories you've burned, and how often you stood up. It's that last one that starts to get weird. The Watch challenges you to stand up at least once during 12 different hours in a single day. It sounds simple, but you'd be surprised at how lazy we all really are. The Watch really makes you work to meet its standing goal, too. Hanging around my standing desk for an hour doesn't count. Even walking around my apartment cooking and cleaning won't always set it off. You have to get up, walk an appreciable distance, and only then will it give you credit. Two taps doesn't mean stand, it means an hour has almost passed The way you know that either you or the standing tracker is failing is that the Apple Watch will alert you with a pair of taps and a message — ""It's time to stand!"" — if it thinks you haven't stood up in a while. And more often than not, I get this alert whether I've been standing or not. At first I found it frustrating — I wanted credit for the incredibly basic activity I'd completed! — but eventually I started to find its failures oddly helpful. The standing reminders, it turns out, are perfectly reliable: they always come at 10 minutes before the hour. I don't get all that many notifications sent to my Watch, so whenever I feel those two taps, it's easy to tell when they mean that another hour has almost passed.    Using the standing reminder this way has turned my Apple Watch into light version (or maybe a hyper-intelligent version) of the Durr, an odd watch that came out last year with no face on it. Made by a pair of designers, the Durr lightly vibrates every five minutes, and that's it. It doesn't tell you what time it is. It just tells when that time is passing. Wearing one is an interesting experience — sometimes you just entirely ignore its vibrations, but other times they'll shake you out of a trace and really get you moving. Time is passing. You need to get things done. This is far from the high-tech health feature that Apple dreamed of, but it's also probably the best way to deal with the odd side effects of a confused computer strapped to your wrist. Getting a vibration once an hour on the Apple Watch isn't quite as meaningful as feeling the Durr's vibration every five minutes, but it still delivers a sliver of that same sensation. Not only does the standing reminder's regular pair of taps serve as a signal that time is passing, it's actually able to tell you the time. There are 10 minutes until the next hour begins: Maybe you have a meeting. Maybe something's due. You might want to wrap up what you're doing and move on. Speaking of which — Tap Tap — I'd better wrap this up. I'm supposed to be somewhere soon.",0.456155812014674,0.543844187985326,0.15536931653003086,655,4.4213740458015272,347,5.3170028818443802,0,0,"Apple, Tech",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

When artificial sweeteners are in the news, it’s rarely positive. In the last few years, sweeteners have been linked to everything from Type 2 diabetes to cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure, and stroke. Still, products like Splenda and Sweet‘N Low remain a cornerstone of many a weight-loss strategy, mostly because doctors don’t quite understand how sweeteners contribute to disease. That may soon change, however, as results from a study, published today in Nature, point to a possible mechanism behind these adverse health effects. ""Our results suggest that in a subset of individuals, artificial sweeteners may affect the composition and function of the gut microbiome"" in a way that would lead to high blood-sugar levels, said Eran Elinav, an immunologist at the Weizmann Institute of Health in Israel and a co-author of the study, during a press conference yesterday. This, the researchers say, is bad for human health because when sugar levels are high in the blood, the body can’t break it down, so it ends up being stored as fat. High blood sugar ends up being stored as fat. To reach these conclusions, Elinav and his team first tested the effect of three common artificial sweeteners — aspartame, sucralose, saccharin — on rodents. They found that each of the sweeteners induced a change in blood sugar levels that surpassed that of the mice who consumed actual sugar. And later tests involving the main sweetening agent in Sweet‘N Low, saccharin, yielded similar results in both lean and obese mice. But mammals don’t actually digest artificial sweeteners — that’s why they’re ""calorie-free"" — so the reasons why these mice were experiencing blood-glucose alterations was still mysterious, Elinav said. Still, the researchers had an idea: maybe the bacteria that lived in the guts of the mice were interacting with the sweeteners. So the researchers performed several experiments to test their idea. In one, they gave antibiotics to mice who had been fed sweeteners regularly. Antibiotics kill gut bacteria, and when these mice had their microbial guests cleaned out, their blood sugar levels went back to normal. In another experiment, the scientists transplanted feces — a rich source of gut microbes — from sweetener-fed mice into rodents that had never consumed artificial sweeteners. The procedure caused the recipient mice to experience oddly high blood glucose, like the mice in the sweetener group. Finally, Elinav and his colleagues used genetic analysis to reveal that alterations in the composition of microbial colonies were also accompanied by changes in bacterial function — changes that could very well explain why the mice were experiencing such high blood sugar. Findings in mice aren't nearly as convincing as findings in people  But findings in mice aren’t nearly as convincing as findings in people, so the researchers set out to investigate human sweetener consumption. In the first experiment, the researchers analyzed the blood-sugar levels and gut bacteria colonies of 381 participants. And, as expected, Elinav and his colleagues found that people who consumed sweeteners in large quantities also showed disturbances in several metabolic parameters — including increased weight — as well as distinct microbial changes in their guts. The results from the second, much smaller human experiment might actually be the most illuminating. ""We followed for a single week a group of seven human volunteers who do not consume sweeteners as part of their normal diet,"" Elinav said. During that period, the researchers gave them a single dose of saccharin, and monitored their vitals. After just four days, half the participants showed microbial alterations and increases in blood sugar levels, he explained, ""while the other subset had no meaningful effect immediately following the consumption of sweeteners."" In other words: some people are more susceptible to the effects of artificial sweetener than others. The handful of studies suggest that consuming non-caloric artificial sweeteners boosts the risk glucose intolerance in both humans and mice, as a result of changes in gut microbe function, the researchers wrote in their report. Yet, because of the preliminary nature of their results and the small number of human participants involved, they stopped short of suggesting that people change their eating habits. ""By no means are we prepared to make recommendations as to the use and dosage of artificial sweeteners based on the results of this study,"" said Eran Segal, a study co-author also at the Weizmann Institute of Health. Other researchers, however, were more forthcoming. ""People need to be much more mindful of what they are eating and  drinking and make efforts to avoid products that have added sweeteners  in any form"" said Susan Swithers, a behavioral neuroscientist at Purdue University who wasn’t part of the Nature study, in an email to The Verge. The studies showed not only a causal link between the changes in the gut and artificial sweeteners, but that the observed changes happen quickly, she wrote. ""People need to be much more mindful of what they are eating and drinking."" Not everyone agrees with the design the researchers used to address the question about artificial sweeteners and weight gain. Christopher Gardner, a food scientist at Stanford University who didn’t participate in the study, says that the fact that the researchers gave the FDA's maximal acceptable daily intake of saccharin to the human participants — about 5 mg / kg body weight per day — isn’t ideal. In a real-life setting, that dose would be the equivalent to a 150-pound person consuming 42 12-ounce sodas per day, or 8.5 packets of pink Sweet 'n Low per day. ""That may be ‘acceptable’ according to some set of guidelines,"" Gardner wrote in an email, ""but it should be noted that realistically this is a very high dose they are using and one that wouldn't be consumed by a typical consumer."" Still, the idea that we might finally have an explanation for the adverse health effects seen in certain sweetener studies is worth paying attention to. Should the findings prove reproducible, doctors will be tasked with understanding why some people are susceptible to microbiome alterations, while others aren’t. And sweetener companies will have to address the criticism — in addition to rethinking their marketing strategies. ""The work is important,"" Swithers said, ""because it underscores the role that artificial sweeteners may play in contributing to the very problems they were designed to help.""",0.49843103787462895,0.501568962125371,0.8364257627759857,1061,5.2959472196041473,514,6.4591439688715955,0,0,"Science, Report",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Currently, there are over 7 billion people on the earth.  ""Rapid population growth in high-fertility countries can create a range of challenges."" The research was led by the University of Washington and the United Nations, and it's being published today in the journal Science. The researchers write that their new estimate was made using more modern statistical models than what have been used in the past — in fact, prior estimates, they write, factored in a number of arbitrary and unhelpful figures. Though they landed on 10.9 billion, they also provide a broader estimate, writing that there's a 95 percent chance that the world population will land somewhere between 9 billion and 13.2 billion in 2100. Most of the growth is predicted to come from Africa, which the researchers say will grow from 1 billion today to around 4 billion at the end of the century. This is likely because family size is still large there, and there's still a significant and unmet need for contraception. Populations almost everywhere else aren't expected to grow anywhere near as much, with Europe, North America, and Latin America remaining below 1 billion each. Asia is currently at 4.4 billion, but it's only expected to hit around 5 billion in 2050 and then start to decline. The estimates are all based on life expectancy and fertility rates. How those two factors are changing is going to make the biggest difference in what actually becomes of the population, and the researchers suggest that some of the population increase might be reduced by investments in family planning programs and the distribution of contraception. It may well be important that governments of the world do that, too. ""Rapid population growth in high-fertility countries can create a range of challenges,"" the researchers write.

United Launch Alliance, or ULA, is a joint venture by defense contractor Lockheed Martin and aerospace company Boeing, which recently won one of two contracts to develop a spacecraft capable of shuttling astronauts to the ISS. ULA's Atlas and Delta lines of rockets are used by both NASA and the US military, but it's been criticized for using Russian-built rocket engines, especially after sanctions were declared earlier this year. ULA said this summer that it had signed contracts with ""multiple American companies"" to investigate the feasibility of developing new designs, and Blue Origin may have been one of those companies. The current contract covers a four-year development period, entering ""full-scale testing"" in 2016; Blue Origin has apparently already been developing the BE-4 rocket engine for three years and is currently testing components. ULA says it's not a ""direct replacement"" for the current RD-180 engines, but it will be integrated into future generations of rocket, and the frequent references to ""American"" components suggest that this is an attempt to move away from Russian products. It will supposedly be cheaper, though the price isn't given, and Blue Origin plans to eventually sell it to manufacturers besides ULA. Founded in 2000, Blue Origin has been more secretive than competitors like SpaceX. After buying up land in Texas for undisclosed purposes, Bezos revealed in 2005 that he was planning to build a testing range for reusable rockets that could travel to low-Earth orbit. Since then, the company has remained quiet about its progress. It was an early member of NASA's commercial cargo and crew program, receiving a $3.7 million contract in 2010 to develop its New Shepard launch system. According to NASA's site, Blue Origin has received a total of $25.6 million, but while it remains a partner, it wasn't funded in the latest rounds of the program. The latest major milestone for Blue Origin came in December of 2013, when the company revealed it had successfully test-fired a BE-3 rocket engine at its Texas base. ""Blue Origin has made steady progress since the start of our partnership under the first Commercial Crew Development round,"" said NASA commercial spaceflight development director Phil McAlister at the time. The company, however, failed to convince the US government to give it access to the Kennedy Space Center's Launch Complex 39A, which was officially leased by SpaceX in April — SpaceX founder Elon Musk had earlier pushed for the decision by saying he would more likely ""discover unicorns dancing in the flame duct"" than see Blue Origin come out with a workable spacecraft that could take advantage of the pad.

It's the latest step in the commercial crew transportation partnerships that it began exploring as the space shuttle program wound down. In 2011, after a round of smaller preliminary grants, NASA gave a total of $270 million to Boeing, Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin, SpaceX, and Sierra Nevada Corporation, which were asked to work towards ""safe, reliable, and cost-effective"" ways to get astronauts to space. Ultimately, the final craft will provide an American alternative to Russia's Soyuz capsules, on which NASA currently rents seats for its astronauts. The latest contract, which will last until 2017, provides six seats for $424 million. But political tensions with Russia have made this an uneasy bargain. It suspended relations with Russia's space program during the Ukraine crisis in April, and companies like Boeing have leveraged international conflict to push for more rocket funding. Private companies have already begun to deliver supplies under contract with NASA. SpaceX's Dragon capsule became the first commercial craft to dock at the ISS in 2012, and Orbital Sciences Cygnus craft followed in 2013. SpaceX's fourth resupply mission — which, among other things, will send the first 3D printer into space — is scheduled for this Saturday, September 20th. NASA, meanwhile, is putting its own resources towards the Space Launch System, a large rocket capable of deep space exploration. The SLS is supposed to propel a crewed mission first to an asteroid, then to Mars sometime in the 2030s. It's supposed to make its first test flight by November of 2018, and NASA just went through a ""dress rehearsal"" for recovering the capsule from the ocean. ""As research takes place in Earth orbit and the companies refine these new space transportation systems, we at NASA will be working just as diligently readying our new heavy-lift rocket,"" said Bolden.",0.47265010432919974,0.5273498956708003,0.8848249978588908,510,5.2509803921568627,306,6.1470588235294121,0,0,Science,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Thankfully, a group of NASA scientists have finally looked into the question. And, according to the study they published today in the Journal of Experimental Biology, humans can run a lot faster in lunar gravity than anyone ever expected. In the study, researchers took eight study participants — three of which were actual astronauts — on a trip aboard NASA’s DC-9 aircraft, a plane capable of reducing its internal gravity to that of the moon during swooping, parabolic flights. There, the astronauts were asked to run on a treadmill during 20 second-long dips at lunar gravity.   Credit: NASA John De Witt, senior biomechanist at the NASA Johnson Space Center and a study co-author, told a reporter at the Journal of Experimental Biology that the experiment wasn't exactly pleasant for the eight participants. ""If you get sick you're done... We wanted to be sure we had people that were used to flying."" Still, it appears that they made it through with flying colors. According to NASA's theoretical calculations, the test subjects should have had an average walk-to-run transition speed of about 1.8 miles per hour (that's compared with transition speeds of 4.5 miles per hour here on Earth). But in the real-life setting offered by the DC-9 aircraft, things turned out differently: the participants' average transition speed was actually 3.13 miles per hour — a speed that's much closer to those we see on Earth.   Credit: NASA So why were NASA’s theoretical calculations off-base? De Witt thinks the forces generated by the counter-swinging movement of the runners' arms and legs gave them a boost. That force probably exist on Earth as well, he said, but because Earth’s gravity is far stronger, the effect is too small to notice.

Carried aboard a SpaceX Dragon capsule, the printer will be installed in the International Space Station, where astronauts will test the technology that NASA hopes will one day transform space exploration, eventually playing a vital role in travel to the moon, asteroids, and Mars. For consumers, the hype surrounding 3D printing has generally far overshot clear uses for it, but space exploration is one case where the technology could actually be revolutionary. ""Right now if something breaks, we’re completely dependent on launching a replacement from the ground,"" says Niki Werkheiser, the project manager for the printer experiment, a process that can take months and cost thousands of dollars per pound sent into orbit. ""Imagine launching everything you might ever need for mission to Mars or an asteroid, it would be challenging or impossible."" ""We’re taking our first step from launching hardware to space to emailing our hardware to space."" With a printer, astronauts could manufacture replacement parts and tools on demand. The ability to do so also means they would have to bring far fewer replacements with them to begin with, lightening the load and freeing up valuable space. ""We’re taking our first step from launching hardware to space to emailing our hardware to space,"" Werkheiser says. ""It sounds pretty science fiction but it’s soon to be science fact."" But space also poses unique challenges for 3D printing, the most obvious being the lack of gravity to make extruded molten plastic drop onto the print bed. Heat also works differently in microgravity. There is hardly any convection — heat transfer through the movement of liquids and gasses — so new ways of managing temperature have to be developed. A space printer can’t emit fumes the way many off-the-shelf ones do, lest it contaminate the enclosed habitat of the space station. NASA’s printer was designed by Made In Space, a company founded in 2010 and based in Mountain View, California. It’s small, about the size of a microwave, and prints a Lego-like plastic. To get around the lack of gravity, they modified the printer so that the surface tension of molten plastic keeps each layer sticking together. The whole printer had to be built sturdier than off-the-shelf models so that it would survive launch, and constructed in such a way that components wouldn’t float around. ""Everything on Earth is built with gravity assumed,"" says Grant Lowery, Made in Space’s communications director. Werkheiser is confident the new printer will work, though NASA hasn’t been able to test a full print in microgravity yet. The Made in Space team has taken over 400 flights in the parabolic microgravity simulator — also known as the ""vomit comet,"" a jet that flies in a curved pattern to briefly relieve its passengers of gravity — but it gives them only 30 seconds of weightlessness, not the 15 minutes they would need to complete a print. On the space station, the printer will first make small plastic patches, called ""coupons"", to test things like tensile strength, flexion, and compression. After that, it will proceed to small tools, including the winner of a student design competition. The printer is entirely automated: designs are uploaded from Earth, printed out, and monitored via a live stream, with astronauts needed only for removing the finished object. This printer is a a tech demonstration for larger one due to be flown up sometime in the next year or two. That one will be able to print larger objects out of harder plastics. It will also be available for commercial use. ""Essentially anyone on Earth is going to be able to contract with us for manufacturing ability in space,"" says Lowery. Researchers could print lab tools, Lowery says, and microsatellite companies like Tyvak and Planet Labs could print components and assemble their satellites aboard the station.   The next step is a recycler, which both Made in Space and Tethers Unlimited are working on, as part of a NASA grant. Due to launch sometime in 2016, a recycler would allow astronauts to print a tool, use it, and melt it back into feedstock to be used again. In the more distant future, NASA envisions sending 3D-printing robots to the moon or Mars and having them build structures out of materials on-site. Made in Space has conducted a test using synthetic regolith, the powdery dirt found on the moon. ""At the end of the day we hope to use in-situ sources,"" says Werkheiser. ""We consider this printer the first step on that path to sustainable production of what you need when you need it with resources on hand."" In the meantime, printers will likely be solving more mundane problems. ""If something like the Apollo 13 filter breakdown happens again,"" Lowery says, ""Instead of MacGyver-ing a solution with duct tape and sweat-socks, we can have an engineer on the ground design something and print it out.""",0.3808030237887765,0.6191969762112235,0.8420434545258036,834,5.057553956834532,460,6.2413043478260866,0,2,Science,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Etsy has been shaking up its community of virtual shop-owners in the last few weeks by placing a ban on the sale of metaphysical items such as spells, hexes, potions, and crystals. Shop-owners who were offering such items began receiving emails in the second week of June, stating, ""We've recently clarified our spells-related policies in a way that impacts your shop. Because of this, your shop has been suspended."" The change is part of an update to Etsy's policy on the selling of services. The sale of services has always been forbidden with a few exceptions for services that produce tangible items — such as custom graphic design products and workshops that result in tangible take-home items. Until some point earlier this month, the policy on spells fell under the heading of a service that resulted in a tangible item — so long as the purchase came with a print-out or photo evidence of the spell being cast and didn't make a firm promise that it would bring about the intended effect. The new policy states: Any metaphysical service that promises or suggests it will effect a physical change (e.g., weight loss) or other outcome (e.g., love, revenge) is not allowed, even if it delivers a tangible item. A petition to overturn the rule currently has close to 4,000 signatures and a forum on the Etsy website already has over 950 comments, largely indignant and confused, in response to the changes. Commenters rightly point out that the delineation between what will and won't be allowed under these new rules isn't all that clear. While religious items are supposedly protected, what about those with slightly more mystical properties — for example, the St. Christopher (patron saint of travelers) medal that my grandmother clipped to my car mirror to protect me while I'm driving? Surely anyone selling such a medal would want to suggest what it's for, and that doesn't seem to line up with Etsy's new rules. what will and won't be allowed under these new rules isn't all that clear Another point of contention is the exact definition of the word ""suggest."" Does naming a tea with the word ""sleepytime"" overtly suggest that you should take it in place of a sleeping pill? Is marketing a healing crystal as soothing somehow more insidious than marketing a bath salt in the same manner? Where can I buy a decent mood ring anymore? One commenter posted a clarifying email she had received from the site, which read: To qualify for sale, psychic and tarot readings must be sold in the form of a digital file or a physical document. Both the listings' titles and descriptions need to state the format in which the reading will be sent (e.g. PDF). Listings are not allowed to promise or suggest that the items or readings will effect a physical change (e.g., weight loss) or any other outcome (e.g. love, revenge). Independent of any metaphysical properties they may have, the items themselves must qualify for sale on Etsy as either Handmade items (including digital products), Vintage goods, or Craft Supplies. Etsy has further stated: We want to assure you that this policy applies equally to all intangible services (whether spiritual services or any other types of intangible services). We respect and value the metaphysical community of Etsy, who come from a wide variety of cultural and religious backgrounds. Please keep in mind that other types of metaphysical goods that meet our handmade and services policies are welcome in our marketplace. Ostensibly the goal is to protect suckers from getting seriously swindled, as stories about psychics milking hundreds of thousands of dollars from clients have made national news. But it's hard to believe that anything that extreme was happening on Etsy, and the e-commerce site's public offering in April of this year might be a more obvious, if less altruistic, reason for them to tighten ship. Etsy isn't the first online retailer to ban the sale of ""magical"" items — eBay took similar strides in 2012. So where will the witches go now?

It’s the thing that lies at the heart of Apple’s new Music and News services, and it will soon serve as the fulcrum for Twitter’s Project Lightning initiative. Today’s web user is beleaguered by an overabundance of things to read, listen to, or watch, and the coming battles between web companies will be about how to reduce rather than expand the choices on offer. This month, Apple and Twitter presented their visions for new models of curation that rely on humans first and machines second. Apple Music is a complex, multifaceted beast, but its core concept is a simple one: expert curators making music listening more enjoyable for the end user. The 24-hour Beats 1 radio station ""plays music not based on research, not based on genre, not based on drumbeats, just music that is great and feels great,"" says Jimmy Iovine. The former chief of Beats Electronics has brought his idea of expert-curated playlists over to Apple and the hope is that their quality and relevance will set Apple Music apart from the competition. If nothing else, they promise something different from the usual tech company pledge of ever-smarter machines. ""Music not based on research, not based on genre, not based on drumbeats, just music that is great and feels great."" Not too dissimilar from Apple Music will be Apple News. This new app gathers stories from a wide variety of sources — like so many other news aggregators out there — but it will employ dedicated editors to pick out the most important, relevant, or interesting pieces of news to promote. In this way, Apple is attempting to differentiate not through its technology but through the discernment of its curators. Exactly how successful either of these ventures will be depends on how well Apple does in recruiting the skilled workforce it needs to make the curation credible and trustworthy. If Apple News strips out, say, 90 percent of the stories coming out on the web every day, and if those discarded items are mostly noise and repetition, then it’ll be a great tool for people desperately seeking a higher signal-to-noise ratio in their news-reading app. And if not, it’ll be just another pretty news reader clogging up your home screen. The algorithm aggregates, the curator chooses Both Apple Music and Apple News will, of course, rely on computer algorithms as well. What distinguishes them from the more automated systems that already exist is the emphasis on human input in the final decision making: the algorithm aggregates, but the curator chooses. Twitter is embracing the exact same philosophy with Project Lightning. Live events have always been Twitter’s great strength. When people talk about ""second screen"" experiences associated with watching something on TV, they’re usually referring to the Twitter conversation that is going on alongside notable events like the Super Bowl, the Nepal earthquake, or the latest broadcast of Castle in the Sky in Japan. These conversations are the thing that Twitter is now seeking to organize into tailored collections, replete with richer visuals and a far more coherent presentation than the usual hashtag stream of consciousness. As with Apple’s new efforts, Twitter is pursuing higher quality through selectiveness. The social network is gathering an international group of editors with newsroom experience that will, as BuzzFeed’s Mat Honan explains, ""use data tools to comb through events and understand emerging trends, and pluck the best content from the ocean of updates flowing across Twitter’s servers."" Google Now and Cortana are smart, but they don't have taste Intelligent algorithms and machine learning are undoubtedly useful instruments, but they have their limits. At their present stage of development, smart assistant services like Google Now and Cortana can already predict many of our actions and proactively surface useful information. But they don’t really have taste. A machine can’t explain what makes Threes or Dots such wonderfully fun games to play, which is why Apple and Google have Editor’s Choice sections in their app stores to highlight such standout titles. An algorithm can also collate review scores and present the highest-rated and most-downloaded music album, but it doesn’t have the experience or acumen to recommend an underappreciated artist like Aesop Rock when queried for a more obscure suggestion. The big worry that may arise with the introduction of editorial discretion is the problem of trust. Facebook was sharply rebuked for clandestinely manipulating users’ news feeds in a psychology experiment last year, so Apple and Twitter will have to prove their reliability and good judgment. How will Apple’s editors handle news unfavorable to Apple, for example, and how inclusive will Twitter’s conversation shapers be when it comes to airing unpopular points of view on a given subject? These are relevant concerns, but they’re no different from the ones faced by traditional news organization or even Google, which is famed for its search algorithms but still maintains human oversight of its results and makes deliberate choices in certain circumstances. Apple and Twitter are far from the first to recognize the value of human input in creating the best possible web experience. Websites like Reddit and Digg have grown into massive online communities by using automation only to tally up the popularity of stories among their readers, and then having moderators to maintain quality. Ultimately, it’s always some mix of human and machine that helps us distill the web into something digestible. Right now, the momentum is swinging back in favor of the conscious curator, the human that can make decisions for us in order to tame the big, beautiful chaos of the web.",0.9048631430602936,0.09513685693970642,0.1714271979178952,941,5.2337938363443142,512,6.484375,0,0,"Apple, Culture, Tech, Web, Report",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

This interest isn’t exactly positive: Dad is often the butt of the joke, portrayed as a middle aged, out of touch person with a severe lack of awareness or personal style. Making fun of Dad isn’t really new — Danny Tanner was often the punchline of the jokes on Full House two decades ago — but it’s everywhere you look today. Instead of being thought of as a part of a family unit or as a supportive parent, Dad is more often associated with bad, embarrassing jokes; socks with sandals; and unironic use of a fanny pack.

Telling dadjokes is often a self-deprecating move that’s both endearing and self-embarrassing. It’s admitting (often in a tongue-in-cheek way) that you’re out of touch, but without being mean-spirited. Dadjokes can make a fatherly figure less intimidating while having a little fun at the same time.  But when I step back and observe all of the ways the modern generation has found to make fun of the out-of-touch dad, it’s hard to see it as just another topic that people whip cynical jokes at on social networks. The dadjoke may be inoffensive and patronizing, but beneath the surface it reads as the manifestation of an underlying fear carried by an entire generation. For the millennial (or snake people, if you will) generation, it feels like the fear of becoming our parents. This dad next to me at the Royals game yells ""I got it, I got it"" every time a foul ball is hit #dadjokes  Looking at the backlash against Dad (the dadlash?) through that lens puts a lot of things into perspective. There can be a lot of love in making fun of Dad, but it’s often laced with cynicism, which is more obvious when you’re both the target and deliverer of the punchlines. Youth has been the center of our modern culture for decades, but millennials have been fighting growing up and getting old with fervent abandon. You can see that in the numbers of people in their mid–20s that still live at home with their parents (including, yes, Dad, which provides ample material for making fun of him), or the average ages when people get married and have children, which are higher than they’ve ever been. Millennials have plenty of reasons to fear becoming their parents Millennials have plenty of reasons to not want to be their parents. They grew up in a world with skyrocketing divorce rates, broken homes, and crashing economies. They are entering or already in a workforce where pensions and opportunities to plan for retirement are virtually taboo. They are burdened with crushing student loans and face a housing market that offers bleak prospects for home ownership. Studies have shown that for the first time in American history, the current generation stands to be worse off than their parents in terms of financial stability and job security.

He lives in Milwaukee. pic.twitter.com/2AwmXG8Vwo  If blowing off steam about crummy employment opportunities or lousy housing market manifests itself in memes that make fun of Dad, that’s far from the worst that could happen. We are, all of us, saying ""Oh Dad, You"" as a way of accepting that keeping up with the latest trends is becoming increasingly impossible and that’s ok. No matter how hard we might fight it, eventually everyone does get old, grows up, and no longer lives at home with their parents. I'm really good at dad jokes and that worries me  Watch out snake people, because before you know it, guess what, the dad is you.",0.5004040242390807,0.4995959757609193,0.1766334228528843,900,4.7177777777777781,474,5.9451476793248945,0,0,,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Today, RiverRock operates two dispensaries, grows its own, and makes edibles, extracts, and concentrates. It used to cultivate all its cannabis indoors — a quantity John Kocer, RiverRock's CEO, wouldn't specify, but says comprises between 3 percent to 5 percent of the state's $14 million monthly weed market.  A year and a half ago, the company shifted a large portion of its grow operations to a 27,000-square-foot greenhouse. In simple terms, a greenhouse is an outdoor, semipermanent structure with translucent ceilings and walls, through which light can filter. It's the same kind of thing that conventional farmers use to grow flowers and vegetables. RiverRock's is particularly state-of-the-art, with automated humidity and temperature controls and a special blackout system that can create pitch-dark conditions in the middle of a summer evening. Pitch-dark conditions in the middle of a summer evening The fact that RiverRock is using a greenhouse to grow pot may not seem that extraordinary, until you realize that until recently, most marijuana was grown indoors to stay hidden from view. But in a monumental shift in the cannabis industry, that's about to change. ""This is the trend for the future,"" Kocer says. ""We're the only industry on the planet that grows indoor under light. Tomatoes, flowers, you name it, people don't grow indoors."" And there's good reason other industries don't: it's expensive to grow indoors, where powerful artificial lights — and massive air-conditioning systems used to counteract the heat from said lights — require massive amounts of energy. By harnessing the free power of the sun, growers can save as much as 90 percent on their electricity bills. RiverRock's monthly electricity bill is $25,000 a month, only $2500 of which is used in its greenhouse, versus its residual indoor grow operations which run up the bulk of that bill. Not surprisingly, RiverRock isn't the only cannabis grower going ""green."" In Colorado, industry consultants and greenhouse suppliers estimate there are 10 marijuana greenhouse operations of similar scale to RiverRock's, with several even larger ones in development. RiverRock has plans to triple its greenhouse capacity in the coming months, which will double its weed production. (Although Washington state also recently legalized marijuana, Colorado has progressed much more quickly in setting up its legal cannabis marketplace.) Until now, high-grade pot was almost exclusively grown indoors. ""The reason why indoor cultivation became the cultivation technology of choice was because this was illegal for so long and indoor is easier to hide,"" says Kris Krane, a consultant for the marijuana industry who also runs an incubator for startup cannabis companies.  Patient, ""Wade"", inside RiverRock's greenhouse (RiverRock). Now, even though pot is still federally prohibited, Washington and Colorado have fully legalized it, and 20 other states (and DC) have approved it for medical use. If Colorado is an example, a regulated, legal pot marketplace will mean growers are less concerned about shielding their plants from view, and more motivated to explore cost saving opportunities. Carefully monitored conditions of light, temperature, and ventilation Whether indoors or in greenhouses, growing top-grade cannabis with high THC content requires carefully monitored conditions of light, temperature, and ventilation. Cannabis thrives in warm, moist conditions: RiverRock's greenhouse is kept at 71 degrees, with 40 percent humidity, and is watered via a drip system from overhead plastic tubing. Although every factor in cannabis growth needs to be tightly controlled, humidity is arguably the biggest challenge, according to Zev Ilovitz, president of the Richmond, CA-based Envirotech Greenhouse Solutions, whose company has designed and installed many small greenhouse projects for cannabis growers, and is currently involved in some of the new, larger operations being developed in Colorado. ""Cannabis is particularly susceptible to fungal disease,"" he says. ""You have to have a good venting system."" When growing in the wild, Cannabis plants produce buds as the days become shorter. To get plants to bud, a grower must simulate 12-hour ""nights,"" by blacking out some of the daylight. This is relatively easily achieved in a warehouse, but to do it in a greenhouse, you need a retractable blackout curtain. Some blackout curtains are automated, and can be rolled over the greenhouse like a garage door, while others are manually hung. Indoor growers' greenhouse gas emissions are equivalent to that of 3 million cars. Beyond saving money, marijuana greenhouses impose a smaller environmental footprint — an issue that's become an increasing concern in the cannabis industry. One independent study published in 2011 by Evan Mills, a scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, looked at the yearly energy consumption of indoor pot-growing operations (based on federal estimates of total national marijuana production, from legal and black-market sources). He estimated that annual energy expenditures were $6 billion — six times that of the entire US pharmaceutical industry. Indoor growers' greenhouse gas emissions, he reported, are equivalent to that of 3 million cars. Although marijuana greenhouses eliminate the need for many energy sucking lights, some growers opt for a hybrid approach, using some grow lights to manipulate the plants' cycles. Marijuana, for instance, will grow higher during longer daylight hours, as opposed to budding during shorter daylight hours. So growers who want to encourage the plant's initial growth phase in the middle of winter, say, may artificially produce more ""daylight"" hours through the use of lights. In February, residents of the southern Colorado town of Penrose complained: ""Neighbors in the town said the smell from the plants is too strong and the bright lights from the greenhouses are too invasive at night,"" according to the Denver-based local CBS news affiliate. A $5 million pot 'superstore' has been proposed for the small town of Eagle, CO. Still, any reduction in energy cost is likely to make greenhouse cultivation an attractive option in the competitive world of weed farming. ""Eventually a lot of these warehouses where people are paying top dollar for rent will get squeezed out by greenhouses,"" says Jay Czarkowski, managing partner of the Boulder, CO-based cannabis business consultants, Canna Advisors. ""Greenhouses allow producers to ... have more competitive pricing, too."" Nexus Corp., a traditional high-end greenhouse designer, fabricator, and supplier that has worked for clients including the University of California at Berkeley, reports that it's receiving an increasing number of inquiries from the marijuana industry. ""As long as it's a legal crop, we'll do it,"" says Craig Humphrey, vice president of engineering at Nexus. ""They just need to prove where they are located. We're not selling to a customer who lives in a state that doesn't have it legalized in some manner."" Meanwhile, Colorado is already in full expansion mode. A $5 million pot ""superstore"" has been proposed for the small town of Eagle, CO, which would incorporate a 45,000 square foot greenhouse (in addition to a 6,000-square-foot retail store, and a 3,750-square-foot ""prohibition museum""). Silverpeak Apothecary, a ritzy dispensary in Aspen, CO, in January erected a 25,000-square-foot greenhouse, called High Valley Farm. On a national scale, marijuana greenhouses, like wind turbines or giant satellite dishes, may one day transform cheap land that sits on the outskirts of cities. And Ilovitz of Envirotech, envisions a time when there may also be ""microbrewery style"" greenhouses attached to marijuana stores in cities. ""Greenhouses,"" he says, ""really reflect the fact that the industry is stepping out into the light.""",0.6379578382930758,0.36204216170692416,0.8384470985342611,1248,5.5232371794871797,682,6.7214076246334313,0,0,"Business, Report",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

The nearly two-minute-long video is narrated by none other than Apple CEO Tim Cook, who explains how the company has been aggressively shifting over to renewable energy. ""Now more than ever we will work to leave the world better than we found it,"" Cook says. Under Cook, Apple has increasingly drawn focus to its environmental initiatives, and it appears that it's now pushing toward being seen as a real leader on sustainability. The overhauled environment section on Apple's website now resembles a page advertising a new product more than a corporate initiative, with different sections breaking down the ways that Apple says it's making progress.  ""We are proud of our progress."" In particular, Apple focuses on climate change, stating clearly: ""We believe climate change is real."" Cook recently scolded investors who wanted to see Apple drop its sustainability initiatives in order to focus more on profit, while effectively rejecting climate change. Apple seems to be expounding upon Cook's feelings here, acknowledging that as a major technology manufacturer it can be a significant contributor to climate change through carbon emissions.  To that end, the tone of the new video is not strictly celebratory. Cook and Apple's updated website repeatedly note that their efforts are still a work in progress. Apple has managed to turn its sustainability efforts into something meaningful quite quickly, however. Over the past several years, Apple has shifted from a company that was sternly criticized by Greenpeace for its use of ""dirty energy"" to a company that's been praised by Greenpeace for its use of renewable energy. The video's release also coincides with an article published today in Wired, which finds Apple's environmental initiatives leader, former EPA chief Lisa Jackson, giving a tour of one of the fields of solar arrays that power Apple's data centers. Jackson has been at Apple for less than a year, but Apple is already coming close to meeting its standing goal of powering its facilities entirely with renewable energy. Wired reports that it's now at 94 percent. Apple's new campus in Cupertino — often colloquially called the spaceship for its large circular design — will also be powered by renewable energy exclusively. City council members got a closer look at its environmental impact and the thought behind its design back in October from a video featuring Jackson and architect Norman Foster, and Apple has now brought this video online for everyone to see. The video also introduces David Muffly, Apple's senior arborist, who's overseeing the balance between the campus and the surrounding landscape.  Speaking to its initiatives overall, Jackson writes in an open letter on Apple's website that the company intends to keep the public updated on its path toward sustainability.

Google grew its revenue 19 percent year over year Two weeks ago the company completed a stock split that doubled the number and halved the price of individual shares from around $1,060 to $530. While the total value of outstanding shares shouldn't be affected by the split, there is often a psychological effect of lowering the price per share. It may offer new incentives as investors see an opportunity for greater retail interest in Google's stock at this lower price. Google made some big moves in the last four months. It sold Motorola, giving up on its most expensive acquisition to date and conceding that perhaps it had moved too deeply into the hardware space. At the same time, it acquired Nest and dove into new projects around smartwatches and modular phones. Google took a large one time charge for its $3.2 billion purchase of Nest. For the time being, however, Google's revenues are still comprised almost entirely of digital sales around advertising, apps, and media. Google's Play Store is now larger than iOS in terms of quarterly downloads, although Apple still holds the edge in terms of revenue. But a new report from App Annie indicates that Google is closing the gap on revenue as well. R&D spending continues to increase The company has garnered a lot of press for its ambitious research projects, things like driverless cars and Wi-Fi balloons. Its spending on R&D was up roughly $500 million since this time last year, increasing to from 12 to 14 percent of its overall revenues. Interestingly its operating margins declined by 2 percent over the same period.

Executives from all three companies have met in recent days and negotiations remain ongoing, the report says. Selling off a sizable chunk of customers could help better the odds of Comcast's TWC acquisition getting a thumbs up from federal regulators. The company has already said it's willing to sell 3 million subscribers to a competing cable provider if the historic buyout is approved. Comcast claims those assets and subscribers would be worth a total of $17 billion, a figure that would climb if the company winds up letting go of 5 million customers. If a deal can be worked out, it would be a decent consolation prize for Charter, the fourth-largest US cable company. Before Comcast announced its controversial proposal, Charter had put in its own bid for Time Warner Cable. At one point, Charter reportedly weighed selling several valuable markets to Comcast if it helped fund the deal. But Charter's offer was met with stiff resistance from TWC executives, and soon after the company found itself blindsided by Comcast. Charter felt betrayed by its more powerful competitor, according to The Los Angeles Times. But it seems those wounds are already healing, as now the opposite scenario is playing out. The Financial Times says that Comcast and Time Warner Cable could simply hand over affected customers if all parties agree to a sale, but they're also considering spinning off those subscriptions into a new company — a situation that would see Charter rewarded with a ""substantial minority stake.""",0.45463147861742925,0.5453685213825707,0.8503417978200521,271,5.1439114391143912,177,5.8361581920903953,0,0,Business,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

The documents show a continued focus on the power to blocking sites from the web — a central issue in the 2011 SOPA debates — and a concerted effort to enlist state attorney generals in that fight. Both Google and the MPAA have issued harsh statements over the news, but today the fight is growing into a full-fledged legal battle. Google is striking back against the Goliath project This morning, Google filed a lawsuit in Mississippi district court against State Attorney General Jim Hood, alleging Hood had singled the company out for a ""burdensome, retaliatory"" subpoena. (Hood has faced scrutiny for his role in the MPAA efforts.) ""We regret having to take this matter to court,"" Google said in a statement, ""and we are doing so only after years of efforts to explain both the merits of our position and the extensive steps we've taken on our platforms."" Alongside the lawsuit, Google has launched evidentiary actions against the MPAA and its retained counsel at Jenner & Block, asking them to retain documents for a possible future action. Alongside the legal campaign, Google has launched a public advocacy campaign against the MPAA's newly revealed site-blocking measures, asking users ""kill off #ZombieSOPA"" with a petition to the MPAA. Google has fought the legal actions before, but this is the first time the company has gone on the offense, and suggests a new dynamic in the ongoing struggle between Google and the MPAA. Google is striking back against the Goliath project, and it's doing so in court. The lawsuit centers on a subpoena Hood delivered on October 27th, 2014, asserting that Google anti-piracy provisions were violating a Mississippi consumer protection law. Google says it's protected under federal law and the first amendment, and that the subpoena is an attempt to coerce them into blocking sites that infringe on copyright. ""The Attorney General may prefer a pre-filtered Internet,"" the lawsuit reads, ""but the Constitution and Congress have denied him the authority to mandate it."" While the case is pending, Google's suit also asks that the court enjoin Hood from enforcing the subpoena or bringing any new charges against Google, which would stop Hood's crusade in its tracks. ""The Attorney General may prefer a pre-filtered Internet, but the Constitution and Congress have denied him the authority to mandate it."" According to Google's lawsuit, Hood's subpoena asked for far more data than necessary, so much that simply complying with the order became a penalty. The subpoena asked for 141 specific documents, 62 interviews, and a broad request for any information relating to ""dangerous content"" hosted on Google's network. If Google fails to include anything that fits that description, it could open the door for further lawsuits, creating a potentially staggering burden of evidence. ""In order to respond to the Subpoena in full,"" today's lawsuit alleges, ""Google would have to produce millions of documents, at great expense and disruption to its business."" The suit also emphasizes Google's own efforts to make it easier to report infringing or dangerous content. According to the lawsuit YouTube engineers created a custom reporting tool for Hood earlier this year, and trained his office on how to use it. Unfortunately, Hood seems to have been unimpressed by the tool. ""To date, over half a year later, the Attorney General has used this tool to report only seven videos,"" the lawsuit reads. ""Nor, to the best of Google’s knowledge, has the Attorney General filed any legal action against any of the actual creators of the specific underlying content to which he has objected."" Google's counteroffensive isn't limited to Attorney General Hood. The company has also issued a document preservation notice to both the MPAA and the law firm Jenner & Block, asking them to retain documents related to the Goliath campaign and hinting at further legal action in the future. The result is a major campaign against a program that, until a week ago, no one outside of Hollywood studios knew about. It's just the kind of counteroffensive MPAA executives worried about in the initial email leaks, when they raised concerns over ""what Goliath could do if it went on the attack.""

Yesterday, the search company said it was ""deeply concerned"" by the MPAA's efforts to push new content-blocking methods and help attorneys general build legal cases against Google, accusing the organization of attempting to ""secretly censor the internet."" But a spokesperson for the MPAA says these claims are disingenuous. ""Google's effort to position itself as a defender of free speech is shameful."" ""Google's effort to position itself as a defender of free speech is shameful,"" said the spokesperson. ""Freedom of speech should never be used as a shield for unlawful activities and the internet is not a license to steal.

Google has been a primary target of the MPAA, which argues that it hasn't done enough to prevent users from turning its search tool into a copyright infringement platform. For the past two years, Google has attempted to counter these assertions with a report on its anti-piracy efforts, including YouTube's Content ID matching system and showcasing of legal alternatives. Two years ago, it began downranking sites that received a large number of piracy complaints, a system it extended in the fall of 2014. The MPAA has remained critical; in some cases, going through Google also hasn't wiped out site traffic. Here, it's accusing Google of taking the focus off current state investigations of seedier issues. Last year, attorneys general went after the company for a variety of alleged offenses, including making it too easy to find illegal pharmaceuticals or carry out human trafficking with Search. Google has previously paid settlement money to states over privacy violations. Leaked documents showed that the MPAA was active in supporting investigations against Google, offering legal support, research assistance, and help seeding news about the investigations. The MPAA didn't get into the specifics of these documents, but it defended the strategy at a very broad level.

The FBI formally identified North Korea's government as culprit in the hack this morning, following anonymous reports from US officials Wednesday evening. North Korea has been widely suspected to be behind these attacks for weeks.  ""Such actions of intimidation fall outside the bounds of acceptable state behavior."" ""We are deeply concerned about the destructive nature of this attack on a private sector entity and the ordinary citizens who worked there,"" the bureau writes, saying that this hack emphasizes why cyberattacks are among the biggest national security threats. ""North Korea's actions were intended to inflict significant harm on a US business and suppress the right of American citizens to express themselves. Such actions of intimidation fall outside the bounds of acceptable state behavior."" The FBI does not say what actions it will be taking in response to this attack. President Obama is expected to speak this afternoon, when he will likely explain how the US will respond to North Korea. The White House began setting expectations for his response yesterday, explaining that the response must be ""proportional,"" as the attackers may be looking to elicit a certain reaction. The bureau says that the malware used to attack Sony is related to malware that has previously been used by North Korea. ""For example, there were similarities in specific lines of code, encryption algorithms, data deletion methods, and compromised networks,"" the bureau writes. It also saw ""significant overlap"" in the infrastructure used in this attack and the infrastructure used in past attacks linked to North Korea. Similar tools were used as well. Many of these similarities have been reported in the press over the past few weeks, making these conclusions largely unsurprising. However, the FBI also notes that it used ""sensitive sources and methods"" in identifying the party behind this attack, and those sources and methods are not being described. Sony first became aware of the attack in late November, when its computer systems were brought down globally. A group calling itself the ""Guardians of Peace"" took responsibility for the attack, and since last week it's been releasing stolen Sony files online. On Tuesday, the hackers also threatened attacks on screenings of the film The Interview, leading Sony to cancel its release. North Korea is presumed to take issue with the content of The Interview, which is about an assassination attempt on its leader, Kim Jong-un, and depicts him dying graphically. The comedy stars Seth Rogen and James Franco and was planned for a Christmas Day release. That will no longer happen. In fact, Sony has insinuated that it may choose not to release The Interview at all, including online, on-demand, or on DVD and Blu-ray. That would amount to a big loss for Sony: The Wrap reports it's already spent around $90 million on the film, and that Sony expected to take in at least $210 million in return. The FBI's full statement is reprinted below: Today, the FBI would like to provide an update on the status of our investigation into the cyber attack targeting Sony Pictures Entertainment (SPE). In late November, SPE confirmed that it was the victim of a cyber attack that destroyed systems and stole large quantities of personal and commercial data. A group calling itself the ""Guardians of Peace"" claimed responsibility for the attack and subsequently issued threats against SPE, its employees, and theaters that distribute its movies.   The FBI has determined that the intrusion into SPE’s network consisted of the deployment of destructive malware and the theft of proprietary information as well as employees’ personally identifiable information and confidential communications. The attacks also rendered thousands of SPE’s computers inoperable, forced SPE to take its entire computer network offline, and significantly disrupted the company’s business operations.   After discovering the intrusion into its network, SPE requested the FBI’s assistance. Since then, the FBI has been working closely with the company throughout the investigation. Sony has been a great partner in the investigation, and continues to work closely with the FBI. Sony reported this incident within hours, which is what the FBI hopes all companies will do when facing a cyber attack. Sony’s quick reporting facilitated the investigators’ ability to do their jobs, and ultimately to identify the source of these attacks.   As a result of our investigation, and in close collaboration with other U.S. government departments and agencies, the FBI now has enough information to conclude that the North Korean government is responsible for these actions. While the need to protect sensitive sources and methods precludes us from sharing all of this information, our conclusion is based, in part, on the following: We are deeply concerned about the destructive nature of this attack on a private sector entity and the ordinary citizens who worked there. Further, North Korea’s attack on SPE reaffirms that cyber threats pose one of the gravest national security dangers to the United States. Though the FBI has seen a wide variety and increasing number of cyber intrusions, the destructive nature of this attack, coupled with its coercive nature, sets it apart. North Korea’s actions were intended to inflict significant harm on a U.S. business and suppress the right of American citizens to express themselves. Such acts of intimidation fall outside the bounds of acceptable state behavior. The FBI takes seriously any attempt—whether through cyber-enabled means, threats of violence, or otherwise—to undermine the economic and social prosperity of our citizens.   The FBI stands ready to assist any U.S. company that is the victim of a destructive cyber attack or breach of confidential business information. Further, the FBI will continue to work closely with multiple departments and agencies as well as with domestic, foreign, and private sector partners who have played a critical role in our ability to trace this and other cyber threats to their source. Working together, the FBI will identify, pursue, and impose costs and consequences on individuals, groups, or nation states who use cyber means to threaten the United States or U.S. interests.

""We anticipate, occasionally there will be breaches like this."" In a lengthy discussion of his view on the cyberattack, Obama took a number of digs at North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, saying that he may be a leader whose ""sensibilities probably need to be offended"" by a movie. ""I think it says something interesting about North Korea that they decided to have the state mount an all-out assault on a movie studio because of a satirical movie starring Seth Rogen,"" Obama said. ""I like Seth ... but thinking that was a threat to them? That gives you an impression of what kind of regime that is."" Obama says that the US government will work with the film industry and other private sector businesses in an attempt to better prepare for future attacks. ""We anticipate, occasionally there will be breaches like this,"" Obama said. ""They will be costly. They will be serious. But we can't start changing our patterns of behavior any more than we can stop going to a football game because there's a possibility of a terrorist attack, any more than Boston didn't run its marathon this year because of the possibility that someone might cause harm. Let's not get into that way of doing business."" ""In this interconnected digital world, there are going to be opportunities for hackers to engage in cyberassaults both in the private sector and the public sector,"" Obama said. ""Our first order of business is to make sure that we ... prevent those attacks from taking place."" Obama said that he hopes strong cybersecurity laws will be passed when Congress returns next year, saying that better communication is needed between the public and private sectors. ""Even as we get better, you know the hackers are going to get better too,"" Obama says. ""Some are going to be state actors, some of them are going to be non-state actors. Many of them are going to be sophisticated, and some are going to do some damage."" ""Yes, I think [Sony] made a mistake."" Obama stressed that despite the ability of hackers to take these actions from afar, that cannot be allowed to interfere with American business. ""We cannot have a society in which some dictator someplace can start imposing censorship here in the United States."" Obama was very critical of Sony's reaction to the attack, saying that he felt the studio made the wrong decision in canceling the release of The Interview. ""Sony is a corporation. It suffered significant damage. There are threats against its employees. I am sympathetic to the concerns that they faced,"" Obama said. ""Having said all that: yes, I think they made a mistake."" ""Sony is a private company worried about liabilities,"" Obama added later. ""I wish they had spoken to me first. I would have told them, 'Do not get into a pattern in which you are intimidated by these kind of criminal attacks.' Imagine if instead of a cyberthreat, someone had broken into their offices and destroyed a bunch of computers and stolen discs. Is that what it takes for you suddenly to pull the plug on something?"" Like many who have been criticizing Sony's decision, Obama expressed concern over how scrapping The Interview might set a bad precedent for free speech. ""If somebody is going to be able to intimidate folks out of releasing a satirical movie, imagine what will happen when they see a documentary they don't like,"" Obama said. ""And imagine what will happen when producers start engaging in self-censorship so that they don't offend the sensibilities of someone whose sensibilities probably need to be offended.""",0.4111077915788698,0.5888922084211302,0.6487452841079033,677,4.7976366322008861,353,5.977337110481586,0,0,"US & World, National Security",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

Much of that conversation has focused around the FCC reclassifying the internet as a Title II utility, which would let the commission impose more stringent rules and avoid things like paid ""fast lane"" access, but a new piece of Congressional legislation might seek to limit those controversial fast lanes without requiring reclassification. According to The Washington Post, an upcoming bill backed by Republicans in Congress will establish a new way for the FCC to regulate internet access without reclassifying it as a utility — this bill would give the FCC the ability to prevent internet providers from prioritizing traffic, but the tradeoff would be that the FCC wouldn't be able to reclassify the internet under Title II. Republicans have opposed Title II as it is typically considered anti-business; this proposed ""Title X"" bill could essentially establish a middle ground between full reclassification and a world in which providers can charge for access to their internet pipes. Given that there have already been threats that attempted Title II reclassification could get tied up in the courts for years, this might be an easier path to get around such a protracted battle. Additionally, this bill seems like it could provide a legal path to re-establishing the open internet rules that were struck down at the beginning of the year. Back in January, the FCC lost a case against Verizon — that loss meant that the FCC's basis for treating all internet traffic equally no longer had a legal leg to stand on. The timeframe for this bill's introduction is unclear, but it would have to come soon — the FCC is expected to introduce its own new net neutrality legislation in February or March. If the Republicans can get their bill out first, it could find support from Democrats as well as President Obama, who've typically been against the concept of fast lanes. Indeed, President Obama recently came out strongly in favor of classifying the internet as a utility, but this potential bill could be effective enough to gain his support. However, if the FCC puts forth its own proposal before this planned Republican-backed bill is ready, it might struggle to find support from Democrats who will more likely align themselves with whatever the FCC proposes.",0.39475881219946585,0.6052411878005342,0.8176733429843613,420,5.0619047619047617,229,6.0436681222707422,0,0,"Policy & Law, US & World",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

Expect to see plenty of sequels to popular franchises at this year's Electronic Entertainment Expo. E3 is arguably the most important gaming convention of the year. The biggest titles in the industry — Halo, Uncharted, and Mario — will all make appearances on behalf of Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo, respectively. And each third-party publisher will seek to establish or cement its own major property in an attempt to dethrone Call of Duty and Assassin's Creed.   We should also see the return of many games announced, hinted at, or even show during E3s past. This just may be the year The Last Guardian stops being a Twitter punchline. But the throwback that has us most excited is also the most futuristic piece of tech at the show. Virtual reality and augmented reality should have huge showings, fulfilling a promise made by video games almost two decades ago. We've already told you what surprises we expect to see, along with which big name games we know will return. Here are our top-level expectations for this years Electronic Entertainment Expo. In the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 era, video game publisher Ubisoft established itself as a major contender alongside Electronic Arts and Activision. In large part that stemmed from the massive success of Assassin’s Creed's annual releases. This E3, Bethesda will make a play to join that trio of publishers with its own press conference. We know Doom and Fallout 4 will appear at the event. We may also see a renamed Prey 2 and a sequel to Dishonored. Bethesda’s brands, including Elder Scrolls, are wildly popular, but they've yet to nail an annual series. Maybe that’s for the better, but don’t be surprised if at least one of these games becomes the company’s E3 staple. The biggest publishers on the planet are operating on horrifically thin margins. This manifests itself in a few unsavory ways: employees work longer hours, publicists advocate constant drips of blog promotion, retailers incentivize preorder sales, and publishers green-light sequels. Sequels build off the successes of proven brands. When there’s no room for risk, sequels get made. But sequels aren’t all bad. Blockbuster video games have benefited from regular iteration, allowing developers to focus on the content of a game, and not creation of the tools that will build it. Call of Duty, Uncharted, Halo, Madden, Assassin’s Creed, Mario: these are the big names of E3 this year and every year for the foreseeable future. Microsoft has revealed huge collaborations with Disney at past E3s, most notably Disneyland and Star Wars Kinect games. Like most Kinect games, the final product fizzled. Recently, Disney partnered with EA on at least two AAA video games, both of which should appear at E3 alongside the already successful Disney Infinity brand. Marvel will also appear, in the very least, in Lego form, though AAA games in the universe seem inevitable. With at least one Marvel, Star Wars, Pixar, and Walt Disney Animation Studios film released each year, along with tie-in books and television series, the company has mastered the art of juicing its properties. So where are decent games for Iron Man and Frozen? DC Comics has the latest Batman nearing release with Warner Bros. E3 2015 would be an opportunity for the comic brand to get a leg up on Marvel. We’ll see if they take it. For years, games like The Last Guardian, Prince of Persia, and Mafia 3 have been rumored to appear at E3, only to be no shows. This year, many of these long-delayed projects should finally get overdue presentations. We’re already off to a good start with Doom, announced in 2008 as Doom 4, appearing at Bethesda’s press event. Nintendo’s current roadmap looks a bit sparse. With the delay of The Legend of Zelda on Wii U, the rest of 2015 will see only a handful of new Nintendo-developed console games. While we don’t know for sure what will be on display at E3 — names like Metroid and Star Fox have been tossed around — we do know that Nintendo needs something to keep its fans excited. Last year it had a great showing at E3, and hopefully 2015 will be much of the same. Maybe we’ll even see what a Nintendo-developed mobile game looks like. For the past few E3s, I've overheard conversations about the inevitable failure of virtual reality. At first, Oculus demos took place in small meeting spaces. Then VR spread to the main hall with the help of Sony and Morpheus, but the skepticism remained. This year it will be tough to ignore VR's momentum. Oculus has already announced its plans, leaving Microsoft and Sony to show what they intend to do in the space. 2015 will be the first big year for consumer VR, and E3 is primed to be its promotional launching pad. That means you should expect to see an emphasis on VR games, not just the hardware. The tech each company has planned is impressive, but what will matter most is the games they play.

The console is there to provide a pretty backdrop for the flood of video interviews he’ll be doing to promote his upcoming film Jurassic World, but right now he seems more excited about the memories it’s conjuring up. “In the film when you see the control room, everything on the screen is practical. There are no visual effects involved. So this is all stuff.”  If he sounds enthusiastic, that’s because the 38-year-old filmmaker has enjoyed a rapid ascent over the past couple years. Trevorrow made his feature debut in 2012 with the indie comedy Safety Not Guaranteed, a charming Sundance hit about a newspaper intern (Aubrey Plaza) who chases down an eccentric man (Mark Duplass) who may or may not have built a time machine. The film caught the attention of Steven Spielberg, who picked Trevorrow to take on a new installment of the Jurassic Park franchise, a project that had been kicking around in development for over a decade but had yet to make it to the screen. The result is World, in which a fully functioning Disneyland of dinosaurs finds itself threatened when a new hybrid creature wreaks havoc.  I sat down with Trevorrow to talk about how he made the jump from a $750,000 indie to a $150 million blockbuster, how Steven Spielberg allowed him to make a personal film without compromise, and how the corporate pressure of making a gigantic sequel led to some of the movie’s most interesting themes. Bryan Bishop: Jurassic World is a more thoughtful film than your average blockbuster, but it’s a huge leap from your last film. Was doing a movie of this size and scale even on your radar after Safety Not Guaranteed? Colin Trevorrow: Not right away. Not immediately after. You know, I love these kinds of films. They’re part of the kinds of movies that informed my love for film in the first place, and yet I felt that it was almost crucial, almost an imperative, to make a series of films that would allow me to build my voice and hone my craft. That’s why we have a farm system in sports, that’s why we have filmmakers make many movies before they reach this level. And so if I had any trepidation about doing it, it was because of that. And I almost had to be — you know how they have method actors? I had to be a method director. I had to almost play the role of myself 20 years from now, with far more experience and far more knowledge, and I went method the whole damn time. This movie had been in development for a long time, and nobody could crack it. What intrigued you about this particular sandbox when [producer] Frank Marshall contacted you? I didn’t know necessarily what the movie was about going in. I knew they wanted to make a Jurassic Park IV, and my question was Why? [Laughs.] And so we have that conversation right away, and once we came up with some answers as to why, then it got really interesting. And then we were able to build a story around those answers, and build a plot around them. I feel like it is a great privilege to write a screenplay based on a story by Steven Spielberg. These are his ideas; this idea of having a park that’s functional, and having a raptor trainer who is trying to communicate with those animals, and then having this genetically modified dinosaur that breaks loose. Those three pillars came from his mind, and they’re so rich and they have so much room to build something creatively around them that I couldn’t help myself. Yes, I had to go into that world; I had to do it. Going back to that idea of being a method director— We’ve coined that phrase now! It worked! But I’m just wondering how you handled the logistics of such an enormous production, coming from this much smaller movie. Like anything, you act like you’ve been there before. And I made sure if I didn’t know something, I would say, ""I don’t know what that is,"" and someone would explain it to me. I did always know what I wanted, and I don’t know where that comes from, but I was very confident in what I wanted to see and how I wanted to see it and how these shots were designed and how these performances should be and what the story was. I think when you’re surrounded by technicians and craftspeople on the level of the ones that I very intently surrounded myself with, [you get the best results] as long as you are willing to not necessarily defer choices, but to empower people to be creative and to do what they do as best they can do it, and not feel like they have to sit back and just execute your vision. Everybody who’s making a movie has a vision of how their particular piece can fit in. And to me, that’s just good directing, and I’ll continue to do that even when I do have more experience. I do know how to do this now. I can direct a big blockbuster movie now; I learned that over and over the course [of production]. I slowly earned a master’s degree in making blockbuster movies. I was really impressed with your action sequences. They’re big, effects heavy, and they’re very confident. Was there anything you looked back to as a reference point beyond the first film for those? No, and I shot them myself. I had a second unit that operated for a very specific sequence, which is when the vehicle was moving fast and the raptors were running. All that exterior vehicle stuff, we have a second unit do that. And also Pratt riding the motorcycle, those plates — we had a great second unit. And that was just [because] we shot the movie in 78 days. That’s an insane schedule for something this size. Yeah, that’s an insane schedule. So we did need to bring in a second unit of some pretty skilled people for that. But I shot the rest of it myself with John Schwartzman, my cinematographer. And I laid them out very carefully in previs [animated storyboards], and I storyboarded them. I love the previs process. I was very creatively invigorated by it, and I worked with that team — these guys at Halon — very, very closely for a long period of time. And I think we’re going to do it on the Blu-ray, we’re going to put the previs up with the sequence next to it, and it is just shot for shot what had been designed. So I directed the movie three times: in the previs, I directed it on set, and then when we put the animals in I had the chance to do it a third time. When you direct a movie that many times, you should probably get it right at some point. You shot this movie on film, and you often pushed for using animatronic dinosaurs instead of just going straight CG across the board. How much of that was about grounding this in the world of the first film, and how much was it just about making it feel as real as possible? It was both. I had a very interesting relationship with Jurassic Park on this movie. I would say it on set: I want to hold Jurassic Park in our hands, but not too tight. I was constantly pushing against any instinct I had to do an homage to it, and then also sometimes embracing it and just doing it. I don’t know what made me decide now it’s okay to do a twisting shot away from a dinosaur bone being brushed away. But if I was going to do it, I wanted to then subvert into something else. So very, very rarely — if ever — do we do something that is just a straight homage. It always turns into something else. I have to imagine the awareness of the legacy you’re working within — even while you’re collaborating with Spielberg — had to be there, if only because you were clearly able to push against it and make the film your own at the same time. And he really encouraged me to make it my own throughout the process. [My co-writer] Derek [Connolly] and I came in pretty hot, and we knew what we wanted to do, and we felt like if we didn’t do it then this whole thing wasn’t going to work. Because at the time we were pushing toward a release date that we ultimately didn’t have to do. Steven bought us another year, which was [the right call]. It was no way to make a movie, the way that it was being done. And actually, the fact that we were pushing toward that release date informed what the movie ended up being about. You had this big corporation who had this product, and they had to deliver it to the people in order for the shareholders to feel like they were doing their jobs. And so we wrote a movie about it. And amazingly, they’re releasing it all over the world. But Steven was extremely supportive and encouraging, [and wanted me to] make a movie that was personal for me, and that I could feel was an original movie set in the context of Jurassic Park. And that’s a very specific idea, and it’s a different kind sequel, or reboot or remake. I don’t even know what it is. It’s its own thing. And this movie feels as original and personal to me as Safety Not Guaranteed, because we built it. Jurassic Park is one of those just profoundly indelible ideas that Steven happened to be involved in during a period of time. There are four that come to mind. A kid who tries to help an alien get home. A teenager has to make sure his parents fall in love so he can exist. Then stopping the Nazis from getting the power of God, and dinosaurs being resurrected and walking the earth. These stories are as valuable as myths and legends and fairy tales to us, and I think that’s why they’re being retold. You’re part of a class of filmmakers with specific voices and visions that are making the move to blockbusters while still maintaining your own unique perspective. I think of someone like Rian Johnson, or Duncan Jones; Gareth Edwards. It’s beginning to feel a little bit like the ’70s, in that we’re seeing studio movies with more personal voices than we have in the past. Do you think this will change the way the industry approaches summer movies? I hope that it makes them good! All of the people you just named really love movies, and are very sincere in their want to make good movies. And are very creative; aggressively creative, all of those names. And I have other friends who I consider part of my generation — certainly my generation at Sundance. The three filmmakers that I identify with as being my generation are James Ponsoldt [The Spectacular Now], Ava DuVernay [Selma], and Benh Zeitlin [Beasts of the Southern Wild]. And each of those filmmakers has made very different choices. And I constantly urge Ava DuVernay to take on, not necessarily a franchise or one of these things, but to test the limits of what she’s capable of because I think she’s truly great. And I think James Ponsoldt is capable of anything, and we all know Benh Zeitlin’s capable of anything. I’m so proud to have been at Sundance that year with those three filmmakers, and I consider them friends. I hope they consider me friends, too.",0.6539256794522561,0.3460743205477439,0.16523594339084335,2022,4.4609297725024728,775,6.0490322580645159,0,12,"Culture, Entertainment, Film, Interview",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

It was a simpler time, when all most people expected out of VR was a cool way to play games. Now, more than two years after that first trip into virtual reality, Oculus has announced its final product... and we're back to where we started, with games. But that's a good thing. During the very first wave of real Oculus hype in 2013, everyone had something they wanted to play (or were scared to play) on the Rift, whether it was an MMO or a horror game or a first-person shooter. Very few people had spent more than a few minutes in the headset, and we were still blissfully ignorant of problems like motion sickness or poor weight distribution. Soon enough, though, the doubts crept in. Valve started to hack in support for Team Fortress 2 and quickly realized that this raised all sorts of problems. First-person shooter characters move incredibly quickly. The heads-up display conventions we were used to looked strange in VR. Head tracking duplicated a kind of motion we were used to doing with mice or gamepads. Making VR games turned out to raise all sorts of questions Some of the most interesting and promising Rift projects came out of the period of experimentation that followed. A multiplayer space-fighting demo from EVE Online developer CCP, for example, would later become the much-anticipated game EVE Valkyrie. Other creations were focused less on play and more on the feeling of ""presence"" that VR could create. Disunion took a couple of minutes at most and involved no interactivity except head motion, but it turned out that this was all you needed to experience being executed by guillotine.  Oculus was always open about one thing: it didn't understand how people were going to control anything in virtual reality. Despite experiments with motion controllers like the Leap Motion and Razer Hydra, and the existence of quirky custom hardware like the Virtuix Omnidirectional treadmill, developers tended to focus on the traditional and widely available Xbox gamepad. ""At the beginning, I think we’ll focus primarily on gamepads,"" Oculus co-founder Palmer Luckey told us at the end of 2013. ""We don’t want to say you’re going to need a $200, $300, $400 system in addition to your Oculus Rift."" Slowly, it started looking like you wouldn't need any system beyond the headset itself. In 2014, Oculus showed up at Sundance to demonstrate the potential of cinematic virtual reality. A combination of live-action video and 360-degree audio could create uncanny experiences, like a stunningly realistic recording of musician Patrick Watson. When Facebook bought Oculus later this year, the company said it would still focus on games, but the possibilities seemed much broader. Soon, it seemed like you might not need a controller at all Since Oculus discouraged all but the most determined from buying their own development kits, though, audiences primarily needed foolproof options that didn't take long to get through. As it turned out, advertising tie-ins filled this gap perfectly. Pacific Rim, Game of Thrones, and The Avengers were obvious choices, but even companies like Marriott and Mountain Dew produced their own VR experiences. VR felt closer than ever to the mainstream, but only in the form of short and comparatively passive experiences. Though a custom Oculus controller was rumored over and over, when the company introduced Crescent Bay in the fall of 2014, it gave users a wider range of motion but no controller at all. For the past year, most Oculus statements about input have been noncommittal and slightly frustrated.  When Oculus partnered with Samsung on the Gear VR mobile headset, it explored one possible solution: a trackpad paired with a simple point-and-click interface. The same strategy had been used in Google Cardboard, which was purposely designed to avoid making users do anything too complicated or time-consuming. Even some leaked Oculus images showed a ""simple input device"" that looked like a remote control. It was certainly possible to build a good point-and-click game, and several developers did, but the Gear VR didn't feel like a gaming-first platform. The Rift, meanwhile, was mostly used to show off Lost, Oculus' first VR movie. (A second is premiering in late July.) From Xbox gamepad to... Xbox gamepad But until the very end of today's pre-E3 press conference, it was almost as if none of the past year had happened. Oculus came out, brought out the Rift, and announced that it would be shipping with an Xbox gamepad. It showed off a survival horror game, an RPG, even the old standby EVE Valkyrie. Everyone in VR has spent a long time exploring the range of experiences you can create in virtual reality, from puzzle games to journalism, with the assumption that they'll mostly be seen at public events, on bare-bones headsets, or in the homes of hardcore VR enthusiasts. After two development kits and several prototypes, though, Oculus seems to have reached a point where things aren't perfect, but good enough. At this point, it's time to turn the most solid of those ideas into things that can stand on their own, and that real people will want to experience for long enough to justify buying a whole new piece of technology. And that's going to set the stage for VR's next big ambitious leaps, like the motion controllers Palmer Luckey introduced at the last minute. (It's less clear how Oculus will deal with the range of custom peripherals that are already out there.) It's taken a long time to get back to where the Rift began — as the best gaming display on the planet. If the wave of demos at next week's E3 hold up, though, it might finally be time to say that Oculus has pulled it off.",0.4074263029378379,0.5925736970621621,0.1902777581710646,995,4.9035175879396986,522,6.0862068965517242,0,0,"Culture, Entertainment, Gaming, Editorial",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Huge fall movies are starting to make their presence known, with three enormous names putting out trailers this week (Hunger Games, Ridley Scott's adaptation of The Martian, and Spielberg's spy thriller). Outside of that, there's still a lot of interesting stuff going on, ranging from Disney animation to an adaptation of Scream for MTV. You can see this week's 11 trailers worth watching below.   Mockingjay Part 2 may still be months away, but a first look at it is already here. A teaser debuted this week showing everything in the film coming to an appropriately huge climax, which is about what you should expect from a ""Part 2."" It'll be out November 20th.   This looks like it should be some good sci-fi. Ridley Scott's latest film is based on the popular novel The Martian, about an astronaut who becomes stranded on Mars. It looks like a story about survival and ingenuity rather than battles and explosions, which is always an exciting change of pace. The cast is also packed with incredible names. It'll be out October 2nd.   Steven Spielberg's latest film is a Cold War spy thriller with Tom Hanks as the star. Basically, there's a lot to like here, including the fact that the Coen Brothers worked on the script. It'll be out October 16th.   The Program is about how Lance Armstrong's use of performance-enhancing drugs was eventually uncovered. It's obviously a fascinating story, and this film is even based on a book by David Walsh, the journalist who was instrumental in uncovering Armstrong's drug use. I also love that Dustin Hoffman just kinda pops up? There's no release date for the film just yet.   Disney's Zootopia doesn't come out until next year, but the studio is already starting to introduce the film to audiences. And that's really all this is: an animated introduction where Jason Bateman explains what's going on. It's hard to get too excited about some talking animals just yet, but Disney still has plenty of time to show more. It comes out next year on March 4th.   I think it's pretty safe to say that Scream Queens is going to be the best TV series with Scream in its name this fall, but it's still interesting to see how MTV is trying to take Scream and adapt it for TV. This latest trailer shows that it's maybe kind of hokey. It starts June 30th.   This movie certainly seems to live up to its name. Creep is the latest low-budget horror film out Blumhouse, so you can probably imagine its found-footage vibe and perpetually eerie atmosphere. It's about a cameraman who spends a day filming a weird dude out in the forest, and things appear to get really messed up as the day goes on. It'll be on iTunes starting June 23rd and on Netflix beginning July 14th.   Why are Will Ferrell and Kristen Wiig starring in a Lifetime movie? I'm not sure that anyone knows, but hopefully the result is the two of them having a lot of fun on screen. It premieres June 20th.   Rian Johnson tweeted this out, saying that Creature Designers is the result of his friends traveling ""the world interviewing creature FX masters for the past few years."" And that result seems pretty fascinating. If you're curious how the most incredible movie creatures are made, you should definitely check this out. There's no date yet on its actual release.   Here's the second trailer for Guy Ritchie's update to NBC's classic spy show. Ritchie is clearly trying to bring a ton of style to this film, but this trailer makes it all feel a bit uneven — like it's too stuck in classic spy conventions even as it tries to take a sly approach to them. It's out on August 14th.   I have very little idea what's going on in this movie or why it's going on or how well any of it is going, but whatever, you just kinda watch it when it stars Bill Murray and Zooey Deschanel and also somehow Bruce Willis is involved.

Since all we can glean from a few still images are cosmetic differences, that's what's being talked about now, however aesthetics won't be the thing that determines the quality of the new Moto X. Motorola knows how to build good phones, but to make them great, it needs to start putting better cameras in them — because what a phone sees is more important than what it looks like. The 2014 Moto X is already a very capable device. Hell, even the 2013 Moto X is still perfectly usable. Both have earned plaudits for their restrained implementation of near-stock Android, which has helped Motorola deliver reliably speedy software updates. The earlier iterations of the Moto X are also well built and can be personalized with a wide choice of colors, materials, and finishes to produce a truly custom look. They offer reasonable battery life coupled with the performance to handle any Android app. They are very good smartphones. But their cameras are terrible. If everyone knows cameras matter, why aren't all cameras great? Every single smartphone manufacturer knows how important cameras are in today’s world. Financial executives dream of the glorious revenues that a great cameraphone can unlock, while hardware engineers have nightmares about trying to fit that sort of imaging equipment within the extremely thin confines of a modern handset. It’s a chronic problem for every mobile device maker, and it’s the most salient question that Motorola has to answer next week: Can you make a good cameraphone? Korean giants LG and Samsung have taken on this challenge directly with their 2015 flagship phones — the G4 and Galaxy S6 — and both have offered compelling answers. Neither is perfect, of course, but these new Android handsets have the image quality and ease of use to compete with the iPhone. Those are the things that Motorola, at least up to this point, has never had. The original Droid did things the iPhone couldn’t, and phones like the RAZR Maxx have provided extraordinary battery life, but Moto has consistently been dodging raindrops by trying to get away with only so-so cameras. Moto has the opportunity to be a champion for Android On Tuesday, when it unveils its full range of new Android handsets, Motorola will be sure to speak enthusiastically about its cameras. It will probably tell us about all the big steps it’s taking to make selfies easier and mobile photography as painless as possible. But those words have to be backed up with actions. HTC spent Mobile World Congress this year proclaiming its new One M9 to be an amazing cameraphone, only to be proven upsettingly wrong by the device's mediocre reality. Motorola should learn from HTC’s mistake. The M9 was disappointing not because it looked similar to previous HTC flagship phones, but because it failed to live up to its own promises of better performance. Nobody is truly waiting for a better-looking Motorola phone. That’s just not a problem for Moto.

Variety reports that a website for the service was accidentally made public this week, revealing the name and also showcasing TV shows from AMC and Fox, two content providers that Verizon hasn't yet announced.

It hasn't been the stablest year for MakerBot. Since last August, the quirky 3D printing company has switched CEOs twice, replacing co-founder Bre Pettis with executives from parent company Stratasys. After missing growth targets, it laid off around 20 percent of its staff and shut down its three retail stores in April. And it's fighting a class action lawsuit that alleges MakerBot and Stratasys knowingly sold faulty printing heads while misleading investors. But the company is also turning a more positive corner. Earlier this week, it opened a new printer assembly center in Brooklyn's Sunset Park neighborhood — a 170,000-square-foot facility that will produce everything from its compact Replicator Mini to the large and high-end Z18. MakerBot says the new factory currently employs around 140 people, with around 40 more open positions, and will let the company double its production capacity. It's positioned it as not just a step forward for MakerBot but a step forward for the borough in general, a shift toward skilled jobs that don't require higher education. In theory, it will also create a more stable production environment, cutting down on equipment failures like those behind the current class action suit. The MakerBot plant's unique twist is that it's essentially a factory for tiny factories. Amid the rest of the equipment, you'll find the odd 3D-printed placard, container, or manufacturing jig; MakerBot puts the designs for its fixtures online. They contribute to a Lego-esque atmosphere that stands in sharp contrast to the building's aging architecture — it's part of a century-old complex currently known as Industry City, where MakerBot has been leasing space since 2013. After years of touting itself as an across-the-board ""prosumer"" printer company — selling machines for thousands of dollars instead of the tens or hundreds of thousands that a company like Stratasys might charge — MakerBot seems to be focusing hard on education as a way to carve out a lasting niche. Along with CEO Jonathan Jaglom, the grand opening included appearances from Brooklyn Technical High School's principal and the dean of SUNY New Paltz's science and engineering school, which opened MakerBot's first ""innovation center"" printing lab last year. Instead of a printer in every home, Jaglom is looking for one in every school — and he wants it to be a Replicator. ""It's like the Xerox of 3D printing,"" he boasts. ""They're not asking for a 3D printer, they're asking for a MakerBot.""  Industry City, home of MakerBot's new facility, was known as the Bush Terminal when it opened in the late 19th century. It served as a Brooklyn shipping hub and once housed The Topps Company, producers of Bazooka gum and several lines of trading cards. In recent years, Industry City has been revamped as a home for artisans and craft-oriented companies like MakerBot, which has moved through several locations in Brooklyn since its founding in 2009. Brooklyn borough president Eric Adams (center) cuts the ribbon at MakerBot's grand opening, as CEO Jonathan Jaglom waves to the crowd. MakerBot's first professional product was the Cupcake CNC, launched in 2009. Note the many small screws — MakerBot plant manager Diana Pincus says replacing them with parts that slide together has been a major priority. While the factory currently operates with 140 workers, CEO Jonathan Jaglom says it could operate with over 200 at full capacity. The Replicator Mini is the smallest and cheapest of MakerBot's designs. It can print items that are around 4 inches wide and long.  MakerBot says it typically requires a high-school degree and a few years of general work experience in factory employees, who are trained on the job. Fans cool the MakerBot factory floor. Gray plastic jigs, printed by a MakerBot replicator, hold parts in place during assembly. MakerBot won't reveal how long it takes to put together one of its printers, which are passed down several steps in an assembly line. This hammer isn't made of either wood or metal, but MakerBot sees adding more kinds of printable materials as one of the biggest new challenges in 3D printing. A testing ground for MakerBot's Smart Extruder printer heads, which were the subject of a class action lawsuit earlier this year. 3D-printed decorations adorn all parts of the MakerBot plant, from conference rooms to employees' computers. MakerBot's plant manager says the company changes products too often to efficiently program robots that would replace human workers on the assembly line. While the majority of the floor space is devoted to assembling products, the plant also includes offices, conference rooms, and presentation space.

Maybe you'll go for a jog after work. If you're looking to improve your speeds, you should imagine a robotic cheetah bearing down upon you. It's not as far fetched as it may seem. After several years of work, researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) announced today that their prototype robotic cheetah can now run free under its own power, without cables or wires attached. Ostensibly designed with futuristic search-and-rescue missions in mind and funded by the military (DARPA, of course), the robot cheetah has been updated with a new ""bounding"" algorithm that precisely controls the amount of force each foot exerts when it hits the ground. The cheetah recently took a test run through a field on campus, achieving speeds up to 10 miles per hour and controlled jumps over obstacles taller than a foot high (30 centimeters).   Researchers at MIT's Biomimetics Robotics Lab (that is, a lab dedicated to robots that mimic biological organisms) say that the robot will soon be able to reach speeds of up to 30-miles-per-hour, exceeding the record running speeds of the world's fastest human, Usain Bolt (27.79 miles-per-hour). MIT's robot cheetah is not the first animal-inspired robotic quadruped to run free and into the darkest corner of our psyches. We saw even faster speeds a year ago from the WildCat robot from Boston Dynamics (a company that was founded by former MIT researchers and has since been acquired by Google).

Typical traps, such as those use to catch the tree-ravaging emerald ash borer, use scents such as pheromones to attract males (males are easier to catch because of their mating behavior, which consists of following and landing on females). But scent-based traps aren't ideal: they often require maintenance, and they don't let researchers know exactly how many insects they've has caught. Fortunately, a group of international researchers appears to have hit upon a brand new way of gaining male beetle's attention: luring them with female decoys. And although the use of a visual cue is interesting on its own, the novelty of their method actually resides in the fact these decoys were biologically accurate, synthetic females (not to mention the fact that the males totally fell for it).  never before have scientists attracted insects ""by synthetically replicating a visual signal."" ""In the field of entomology this finding is quite novel,"" said study co-author Michael Domingue, an entomologist at Pennsylvania State University and a co-author of a study published today in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, in an email to The Verge. Most insect researchers are familiar with the chemical attractants that insects produce to attract mates, Domingue explained, and ""hundreds of such pheromones are currently used for trapping pests."" But never before have scientists been able to attract insects ""by synthetically replicating a visual signal from an insect."" In the study, Domingue and his colleagues created three different types of emerald ash borer decoys — two of which were made using molds of actual females, and one using a 3D printer. The 3D printed version was similar in size and shape to the molded ones, but it lacked the surface texture that characterized the other two. Once they were ready, the scientists pinned the decoys onto leaves in a forest in Hungary, along with two dead female emerald ash borer beetles. If the males were attracted to the synthetic decoys, they would land on the decoys as often as they landed on the dead ones, the researchers reasoned. As expected, the males flew onto the molded decoys as well as the dead ones, whereas male mating flights that were initially directed toward the 3D-printed decoys ""were not completed,"" the researchers write in the study. ""The breakthrough we've achieved,"" Domingue said, ""is that we now know that light scattering caused by small bumps and spines on the surface of the bugs are required to obtain a [mating] response.""    From left to right, a bioreplicated decoy, an ash borer, a 3D-printed decoy, and an oak borer. Credit: Michael Domingue The researchers didn’t stop there, however. To ensure that they could use the decoys to catch and kill the beetles, the scientists also made decoys that bore a 4,000-volt charge so when male beetles landed on them, they were zapped and gathered in a cup below — an occurrence that lead to some pretty gruesome damage, the researchers wrote, ""such as decapitation or distension of the head or reproductive structures."" And interestingly, these zapped specimens also included some females, even though there exists no evidence of females approaching other beetles in nature. ""decapitation or distension of the head or reproductive structures."" ""I’m especially interested to see how this method will compare with those currently used for emerald ash borer [...], both in terms of detection and overall cost of the traps,"" said Dave Jennings, an entomologist at the University of Maryland who didn’t participate in the study, said in an email. Because of North America’s ongoing struggle with the Emerald Ash Borer — an Asian beetle species that was first detected in the US in 2002, and has spread to 24 states and two Canadian provinces since then — developing effective trapping methods has become a priority for entomologists and government officials everywhere. The ""emerald ash borer is a devastating invasive insect pest that has thus far been very successful at avoiding detection methods when present at low population densities,"" Jennings said. So ""being able to find [it] in an area before it’s able to cause significant tree mortality will be very beneficial."" Unfortunately, it’s not yet clear how the males of species will react to the decoys. So far, the traps appear to attract a number of jewel beetle species — beetles of the Buprestidae family — but Domingue’s team isn’t sure if the decoys will be able to target serious pests in a specific way, while excluding less harmful species. The next step in the research will therefore attempt to figure out if varying the decoys’ colorations might increase the traps’ specificity. The emerald ash borer has spread to 24 states and two Canadian provinces since 2002  Regardless, this study represents a significant advancement for the scientists and government officials who have been fighting to keep the beetle from spreading across North America. Synthetic decoys would require less maintenance than scent-based one, and might bring about new forms of trapping technologies, Domingue said — including ""high-tech"" systems that could alert researchers wirelessly when males land on decoys. ""With that capability, entomologists could obtain information about the pests immediately rather than waiting weeks or months to check trap contents"" — a boon when trying to curb the invasion of one of the most tenacious beetle species North America has ever encountered.",0.5134458713504658,0.4865541286495342,0.8470191360063071,921,5.1965255157437564,463,6.3520518358531319,0,2,"Science, Report",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Next Millennium Farms (NMF), located about 90 minutes outside of Toronto, Ontario, is part of a movement to introduce crickets — fried, baked, or milled into flour — to the North American menu. The insect’s nutritional benefits, combined with mounting concerns over the environmental impacts of meat production, is prompting conscious food producers to see the pest in a new light, turning cricket meal into everything from protein bars to cookies. Launched in late 2013 by three brothers — Jarrod, Darren, and Ryan Goldin — NMF is a major supplier of cricket flour, which Jarred describes as ""floured meat."" ""It’s chock-full of protein, has more iron than spinach, as much calcium as milk, all the amino acids, tons of omega 3, and tons of B12,"" he says. ""So not only does it taste good, it’s also unbelievably healthy."" The company expects to ship 3,000 pounds of flour in September alone; by year’s end, they predict that figure will rise to 10,000 pounds a month. ""We’re having fun and this [growth] is all awesome,"" Jarrod says, ""but the amazing thing is that it’s not compromising nature — or taste."" I’m standing with Jarrod and Darren in front of Reptile Feeders, the Goldins’ original pet-food business and the first stop in my daylong tour of NMF. The company also sells a line of edible worm snacks, and those worms are currently housed in the same facility as the insects, rodents, and pythons being bred for pet shops. Darren and Ryan’s love of snakes is how the Goldins got involved with crickets in the first place, Jarrod says. ""They realized that you can sell a snake to somebody once, but if you also sell insects, they’ll come back to you every week."" The two brothers founded Reptile Feeders six years ago, but it wasn’t until 2013 that Jarrod quit his job as a chiropractor to join them in a new venture to push insects as food for people. ""The UN came out with documents on insects for food and feed security,"" Jarrod explains. ""I looked at it and I said, ‘Maybe this is finally the right thing [for us.]’"" A few weeks later, The Clinton Global Initiative gave a $1 million grant to Aspire, a McGill University project aimed at bringing insect farming to the developing world. ""I called my brother Darren and said, ‘This is bullshit, we know more about insect farming than anyone, and we should get this going.’"" After a tour of Reptile Feeders, we drive over to the cricket farm, a 9,000-square-foot warehouse about 20 minutes away. The building’s huge doors have been thrown open, so we can hear the chirping as we approach. The inside is clean and brightly lit. Inside, two employees are piling large plastic containers of live crickets atop one another. One of the meat grinders’ motors blew out, Darren explains, so they haven’t been able to grind crickets into flour at their usual pace. They’re keeping them alive in the meantime, because the crickets are always ground up shortly after they’re dead. Beyond the plastic containers lie the wooden cricket bins. These open-air containers house the crickets that aren’t ready to be turned into flour yet. Each is equipped with an automated system that provides hydration and food. Inside the bins are two rows of elevated ""cricket condos"" — egg cartons stuck together and stacked vertically. According to Jarrod, each bin holds between 70 and 100 pounds of crickets. He estimates that the entire facility houses well over 30 million crickets at any given time. ""We want to remove all the dead and unhealthy crickets from the mix of crickets before we cook them,"" Darren says as he demonstrates the harvesting process. This consists of grabbing one of the cricket condos and shaking the insects vigorously into a large plastic tub. Many of them jump out. Then, Darren drops the condo back into the tub for a few seconds, and the young and sprightly crickets jump back onto the condo. Those that aren’t quick enough are removed. ""We do this three times,"" Darren explains, so by the third condo-shaking, only the liveliest of insects remain. ""I don’t think it makes a difference nutritionally,"" Jarrod adds, ""but the optics are important."" Once the crickets are gathered, an employee euthanizes them using carbon dioxide. After that, they’re transported to the processing facility, a townhouse about 30 minutes away. We stop by as Derek Delahaye, NMF’s cook and product facility manager, is rinsing one batch of dead crickets with warm water, and baking another at 230 degrees Fahrenheit for two hours. Meanwhile, a blond-haired man wearing gloves and a hair net shakes freshly baked crickets out of a plastic tupperware and into meat grinders in an adjacent room. It’s crunch time: the Goldin brothers are filling a big order for Exo, a company that manufactures protein bars with NMF’s flour and currently sells 50,000 bars a month. Jarrod doesn’t have any Exo bars on hand, but he does have a plethora of insects for me to try. First, he opens a bag of plain baked wax worms and lays them on a table. They taste like chicken skin, or maybe roasted chickpeas. Next up are honey-mustard crickets. They’re crispy like bacon, and the seasoning is a nice touch. Finally, I try the cricket flour. It tastes strong and distinctly meaty, and it has a sandy texture. Still, it could definitely be mixed with conventional flour and concealed in a baked good. According to Jarrod, that’s how most customers use it. Companies like Exo and Mark Cuban-backed Chapul use NMF’s flour to make protein bars, while Six Foods is using it to make ""chirps"" (cricket-infused tortilla chips), and Bitty Foods produces cookies and a custom flour blend for home baking. NMF’s goal is to capitalize on the nutritional content of cricket flour — and for the most part they have — but there’s one unexpected issue that’s been holding them back: the product’s name.  ""The industry made the initial mistake of labeling it as flour,"" Darren says. And ""it’s very hard to take back."" A single pound of cricket flour contains 317 grams of protein and costs $40 online, making it more akin (in nutritional content and price) to protein powder than baking flour. Yet the fact that previous manufacturers chose to label it as ""flour"" years ago means that people — reporters from The New York Times, for example — tend to compare its cost to plain white flour. ""It’s like saying well, compared to a Honda Civic, a Ferrari is expensive!"" Jarrod says. ""Well it is! But how can you compare those two cars?"" To counter this issue, the Goldins have decided to make their product even more specialized. They’ve just launched a line of gluten-free crickets, that are fed grains like rice and corn instead of wheat, and have plans for a Paleo line. An organic certification is also on the horizon — but because of a convoluted regulatory process, the crickets’ feces have been certified organic and the company is now waiting on certification for the crickets themselves. Still, the red tape that surrounds selling crickets for human consumption hasn’t been overwhelming. Once the brothers got a permit to import a new species of cricket — the tropical house cricket, which is resistant to a virus that can decimate entire cricket farms — they were essentially cleared for business by the Canadian government (""they can’t [survive the winter] in Canada,"" Jarrod explains, so there’s no danger of them becoming an invasive species). The US has been equally lax, allowing the company to operate under GRAS self-determination, an FDA regulation that allows qualified outside experts, like those who authored the UN report on edible insects, to determine if a product is safe, instead of going through government officials. When you think about it, Jarrod says, this makes perfect sense. More than a quarter of the entire human population eats insects on a regular basis, he says, so ""it’s not a novel food."" The Western world has chosen to pass on eating insects for the past few hundred years, and it’s the Goldins’ plan to bring them back. It’s almost 4PM and we haven’t had lunch yet, so Jarrod and Darren take me to a Mexican restaurant called La Hacienda close to NMF’s facility where NMF’s crickets are used in one of the taco dishes. ""When we started NMF, I really intended to position this as a carbon-footprint company,"" Jarrod says. But potential customers were more interested in nutrition than the environment. ""How could we be so naive to think that people would care more about the environment than themselves?"" These days, the company promotes the flour’s vitamin and amino acid content instead. The hook doesn’t really matter to Jarrod, as long as people start thinking about protein differently. As we chat, I glance at the ""tacos de grillos"" sitting in the middle of the table. For the first time today, my stomach churns. As I bring one to my mouth, I see an insect leg poking out of the corn tortilla. ""It’s good,"" I tell Jarrod and Darren, and I’m not lying. But I’d prefer to only eat one.  ""People come here just for the cricket tacos, and they like it!"" says our server, Rosa, as she clears our plates. ""They say it tastes like chips."" To me, the crickets’ distinctly meaty flavor is more like bacon, and I ask if she’s sampled them. ""You know, I work here, and you have to try it so you can tell the customer what it tastes like,"" she explains, her face now impassive. ""Eating them isn’t the end of the world."" Jarrod smiles through the exchange, and nods when she leaves. He knows he can’t convince everyone that eating insects makes sense, but there are enough people out there already intrigued. ""We literally can’t produce and grow fast enough to meet the demands of the people who are interested,"" he says, ""so we aren’t considering the people that aren’t."" Since their initial investment round — a single investor (who requests anonymity) gave them $50,000 in exchange for a 5 percent share in the company — NMF has grown at a tremendous pace. That shouldn’t be surprising, given the lack of competition: Jarrod is aware of only two other cricket-flour companies in North America, World Ento and All Things Bugs, and they use leftover breeder crickets from reptile feeders rather than crickets reared specifically for humans. ""There’s no controlling which crickets go into the mix, or what they’re eating,"" he notes, so NMF’s product tends to win out with companies who want to make sure their ingredients are safe. Competition will come at some point (a farm in Ohio has plans to start shipping dried crickets raised for human consumption this fall), but for now the Goldins are basking in their head start. In five years, Jarrod says, he’d like to see NMF open farms internationally. ""One day,"" he says, ""we’ll walk by people at restaurants who are eating steaks, and we’ll give them a bad eye.""

But 23andMe had planned to automatically enable the service for all new users beginning Friday. Existing users would have been told of the change and given the opportunity to opt out.  ""Customers need to make their own deliberate and informed decision."" After seeing Vox's story, 23andMe has decided to stop automatically enabling the close relatives feature going forward. New and existing users will now face a pop up or an email telling them about the close relatives feature, giving them a choice to enable it or not.

But it's latest project is based on something more familiar: the human body. As announced today, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) has issued a $2.9 million contract to researchers at Harvard's Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering to develop a flexible robotic exoskeleton that can be worn by soldiers — and eventually civilians — to make them stronger and more resilient. The suit could even help people with mobility issues and paralysis to move again. In that sense, the Soft Exosuit, as it's known, is similar in its goals to other robotic exoskeletons we've seen and written about before. But unlike many of those suits — which tend to be bulky, heavy and somewhat cumbersome — the Soft Exosuit is specifically designed to be as light and flexible as possible. It fits mostly around a wearer's waist and legs and is made up primarily of textiles woven into straps which contain microprocessors, sensors, and a power supply. The motors that provide additional force and mobility are also located in a strap that goes around the wearer's waist. Researchers say that the arrangement of straps was chosen to mimic the muscles of the legs and feet and amplify them in intelligent ways. The project already been in the works for a number of years, and researchers already have several working prototypes, but today's award should help move them even further along in their work. That's good news for the military and for the burgeoning field of soft robotics, which is trying to make machines that are more flexible, bendable, and more resilient to damage.

These usually consist of asking patients questions about their environment, and all are aimed at determining their level of consciousness. But contrary to what you might have seen on TV, the sorts of tests rarely include brain scans — ones performed through a machine called an fMRI — because they’re expensive, but more importantly, doctors still don’t quite know what to look for when analyzing someone's awareness through brain activity. ""Looking at brain activity just isn’t the standard of care,"" says Lorina Naci, a neuroscientist at the University of Western Ontario, in Canada. ""And unfortunately patients with brain injuries are notoriously bad at answering questions,"" so doctors sometimes miss clues that they might have seen if they had used other methods. The patient ""was able to analyze and monitor information coming from his environment."" That’s why Naci and her team are trying to develop a better way of testing consciousness in patients with brain injuries. And what they’ve come up with — a test that combines an Alfred Hitchcock TV show with an fMRI machine — isn’t just significant for the future of brain science. It’s also significant for one specific human being, as it allowed scientists to determine that a patient with an unknown levels of consciousness was in fact capable of understanding the events happening around him — even though his initial injury had taken place over 16 years ago, and he had been unresponsive since then. ""We show for the first time that a patient with unknown levels of consciousness was able to analyze and monitor information coming from his environment,"" says Naci, whose work on the patient was published today in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. In the study, Naci and her colleagues showed an eight-minute edit of Alfred Hitchcock’s ""Bang! You’re dead"" — a video that’s considered suspenseful and engaging — to 12 healthy participants, while monitoring their brain activity using an fMRI machine. Then, they repeated this experiment with two unconscious patients who had retained the ability to hold their eyes open for long periods of time. The first patient, Naci explains, had suffered a cardiac arrest after a blow to the chest 16 years ago, when he was 18 years old, whereas the second patient, a 20-year-old woman, suffered a brain injury of unknown origin about 10 years ago. Tests of consciousness rarely include brain scans because they're expensive ""All the healthy patients showed synchronized brain activity in the brain regions that are ... used as a proxy for awareness,"" Naci says. And so did the unresponsive male patient. These findings alone weren’t enough to determine whether the patterns the researchers were seeing in the conscious participants and the unconscious patient indicated engagement and understanding of the frames being presented before him, however. It’s possible that the video might have been triggering the sensory parts of his brain. So, the researchers combined this experiment with two others aimed at determining which parts of the video were most demanding. ""In order to confirm our findings, we linked actual aspects of the movie to a whole new set of participants,"" Naci says. To do so, the researchers asked new participants to perform a task that would tell the researchers when the movie demanded their attention the most. ""What individuals did in the lab, is they were asked to press a button continuously and every once in a while they had to stop pressing the button,"" all while watching the video. To do this, Naci explains, they had to monitor the their responses ""so they would know when to inhibit them."" Thus, the researchers were able to determine which parts of the video demanded the most attention from the participants based on how often they screwed up. As expected, the findings from that experiment — in addition to a questionnaire based experiment — synced up with the fMRI study: the moments that produced the most errors in the button group matched the moments that caused synchronized brain activity in the fMRI participants. ""the activity wasn’t just [the result] of some automatic triggering."" And, just to be sure, the researchers repeated the experiment with the fMRI group using the a re-edited version of the Hitchcock video. ""We created a movie that was completely scrambled by putting the frames in a random order with no detectable plot,"" Naci says. This still caused a certain amount of synchronized brain activity, the researchers say, but only in sensory parts of the brain — not those that allow us to focus and filter out distractions. ""This was a big result for us,"" Naci says, because it showed that ""the activity wasn’t just [the result] of some automatic triggering."" Russell Poldrack, a cognitive neuroscientist at Stanford University who didn’t participate the study, wrote in an email to The Verge that the main takeaway of this study is that there may be ""big differences in the mental function of people who are labeled as 'vegetative.'’"" With this in mind, the method developed by Naci and her colleagues might provide a ""potentially powerful tool"" for making those distinctions. ""It is of course very difficult to make strong conclusions based on such a small sample of patients, and one would like to see it in a larger sample,"" he said. ""But the results from the single patient who showed the effect look very robust to me."" For Naci, the most important aspect of this study are its implications for brain science. ""There has been no attempt to qualify what is conscious of the brain activity we see through fMRIs,"" Naci says. So, this opens doors for being able to measure consciousness ""in brain-injured patients or even in developmental consciousness, animal consciousness or patients under anesthesia."" ""the father had been taking his son to the movies for many years, on a weekly basis."" But this study only showed this effect in a single patient. The woman didn’t show this synchronicity, so there’s a lot more work left to be done before the researchers can reach any firm conclusions. ""We haven’t yet determined how often this happens,"" Naci says. ""So our next step is to look at that in a number of brain-injured patients, and to figure out how frequently they show this type of activity."" For now, however, the people to whom this matters most are the male patient and his family. ""We see different kinds of involvement from various families,"" Naci says. ""But in this particular family, the father had been taking his son to the movies for many years, on a weekly basis,"" even though he had no way of knowing whether this was making a difference.

This is a nice gesture on Google's part — a little frivolous, perhaps, but one that reinforces its higher-profile inclusivity promotion efforts. The company took a firm stance during last year's Winter Olympics in Sochi with a doodle and message condemning Russia's anti-LGBT legislation and the IOC's corresponding silence, and made the message available on Google's Russian incarnation to boot. Another doodle like that — maybe an interactive one, allowing people to customize their little characters directly from the home page — would have a much greater impact than a campaign limited to the Androidify service.

Happn users can stream the songs directly through the app and display their favorite Spotify songs directly on their dating profiles, though the French startup says it has no plans to use that information to influence matchmaking. Users who are not Spotify members can only send and receive 30-second clips of songs. Happn announced the new functionality at a press conference Thursday evening in Paris, where CEO and Founder Didier Rappaport described it as a natural extension of the company's matchmaking philosophy. ""Music, since maybe the beginning of the world, has been an extraordinary way of expressing emotion,"" Rappaport said in an interview following tonight's announcement. ""And meeting people can also be an extraordinary emotion.""  Happn, which is available on iOS and Android, is like a more intimate (and some would say more stalker-friendly) version of Tinder. The app uses location data to connect people who cross paths with one another, and displays both the date and location where they intersected, within a radius of about 250 meters. Like Tinder, users can only chat if they like one another, but unlike its US rival, Happn keeps a running display of everyone they cross paths with, how many times they've intersected, and a more precise indication of their location — from 250 meters up to 100 kilometers. That can create for some uncomfortable situations. Use the app for a few weeks and it becomes easy to figure out that the woman you've crossed paths with 47 times probably lives or works on your block. Since launching early last year, the app has attracted 4 million members, up from 1 million in December 2014. It's currently available in more than 20 major cities (it launched in New York in September), and the company plans to expand to new markets in the coming months. The app is free to download and use, though men have to pay to send ""charms"" (the equivalent of a Facebook poke) — 10 charms for $1.99, or 250 for $29.99. ""Love is much more complex than that."" Happn's Spotify feature is part of an API integration, and not a partnership or commercial agreement. But the music streaming company has made moves to expand beyond its traditional desktop and mobile platforms. Last month, Spotify signed a multi-year deal to bring its music to Starbucks coffee shops, and it struck a similar partnerships with Uber late last year. In April, the company announced a ""Playlist Targeting"" program that allows brands to use listener data to target specific demographics. For Happn, the Spotify integration could be seen as an attempt to keep pace with Tinder. With an estimated 50 million active users, Tinder's membership still dwarfs Happn's, and it has also added new features atop its standard swipe-left-and-right binary. Last year, it launched a Snapchat-like feature called ""Moments,"" which allows users to share photos that expire after 24 hours, and in April it added Instagram integration on user profiles. And although there are dating apps that match users based on their music interests, Happn says it has no interest in using algorithms to connect singles. ""We will never do matchmaking because someone likes the same music, that's not at all our idea,"" Rappaport said. ""Love is much more complex than that.""",0.6301213650071222,0.36987863499287776,0.8503050210374123,566,5.0194346289752652,329,5.9726443768996962,0,0,"Apps, Culture, Tech",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The house belonged to Anthony Levandowski, a Google engineer best known for leading the self-driving car project. The protesters claim Levandowski left his house on a previous day wearing Google Glass, carrying a baby and a tablet, but only paying attention to the tablet. Today, however, Levandowski did not emerge. The protesters passed out a two-page flyer to Levandowski’s neighbors and loitered. After about 45 minutes, they left to go block the path of a private Google shuttle bus. ""People like Levandowski are gentrifying neighborhoods, flooding the market with noxious commodities, and creating the infrastructure for an unimaginable totalitarianism,"" the flyer said. It encouraged people to block buses, steal from the techies they babysit for, and take down surveillance cameras. The flyer is signed, ""the Counterforce."" The Counterforce objects to the tech industry altogether The rent has long been high in San Francisco. Aggressive land-use policies restrict the amount of new housing that gets built, while greedy landlords have started evicting long-time tenants on flimsy pretenses in order to shake off rent control. But in recent months, rapidly rising prices have stoked resentment toward tech workers who are seen as gentrifiers. Some activists have zeroed in on the private company shuttles that stop at city bus stops but only pick up their own employees. Others are shaming developers and landlords, attempting to pressure them into letting tenants stay. The Counterforce is more ambitious. Named after a resistance group in the Thomas Pynchon novel Gravity’s Rainbow, the group objects to the tech industry altogether. ""We want to destroy the capitalist system, create a new world without an economy, and push back against the alienating technologies that are coming to dominate the cultural and physical landscape,"" a representative tells The Verge in an email. It’s easy to criticize the tech sector for things like its lust for personal data, zealous belief in its vision for the world, and enthusiasm for throwing insane amounts of money after inane levels of convenience. There’s also the timely argument that the internet has led to the surveillance state under the National Security Agency. There is even a case to be made, despite its overwhelmingly popularity, that the internet itself is bad (see Pynchon’s most recent book, or the active debate in the Orthodox Jewish community). What if we were to give up the productivity gains of the Industrial Revolution and stick with musical instruments, printing presses, and windmills, as the Counterforce suggests? What if we were no longer obsessed by the desire to, as one of Pynchon’s anarchists put it, ""Draw ever more complex patterns on the blank sheet""? The Counterforce wants to start that debate. But despite the sexy name, it’s not the group to argue for it. ""Sorry about the rent stuff."" Four protesters visited the San Francisco home of Kevin Rose, founder of Digg, former Silicon Valley poster boy, and now a partner at Google Ventures, at around 10:00AM on Sunday, April 6th. Rose’s wife Darya came to the door, where they handed her a flyer and started chanting, ""Your bubble’s about to bust, your Google belongs to us"" and ""demanding interface"" with her husband. Shaken, she shut the door and called Rose, who was down the street building a skate ramp for a nonprofit organization.  Compared to the rhetoric, the actual confrontation was mild. A representative for the Counterforce sent a short video from the encounter to The Verge for publication, adding that, ""We think the video would add something to the conversation, as it makes it all very human, mundane, and awkward."" The video shows a girl who looks to be in her 20s and features the voices of another young-sounding woman and two men. They accuse Rose, who is sitting on a garden wall on the sidewalk, of driving rents up by funding startups through Google Ventures. ""Sorry about the rent stuff,"" he says. ""It’s mostly landlords though, right?"" ""No, it’s people like you,"" one of the girls says. ""You’re creating five jobs for some guys who are sitting around in a rompus room [sic], you know, doing yoga,"" a man’s voice says. ""And then we’re serving you guys coffee."" ""You’re creating five jobs for some guys who are sitting around in a ... room, you know, doing yoga."" Rose tries to score a few points by noting that the group is filming video that they plan to post on YouTube using an Android phone, both owned by Google. (The Counterforce says it is not hypocrisy to use free technology. ""Our group is diverse and we spend our lives mostly offline,"" they say in an email. ""Some of us use smartphones more than others. Nearly all of us agree that technology and information are addictive for various reasons."") The video ends anticlimactically after the group confronts Rose with a joke he made in 2008 on a podcast about stabbing women in the chest with scissors. Afterward, the Counterforce released a statement demanding that Google donate $3 billion to build anarchist colonies around Northern California where people could live for free, thereby solving the housing crisis. Meanwhile, another group or groups using the name the Counterforce have claimed responsibility for blocking shuttles that transport Amazon workers in Seattle. Andrew Leonard wrote in Salon that the Counterforce was taking the San Francisco protests to a ""new, absurd and potentially dangerous level."" ""What is wrong with these people?"" echoed Leo Laporte, the host of the popular tech podcast This Week in Tech, who interviewed Rose after his encounter. ""This is so ridiculous!"" tweeted Gary Shapiro, the head of the Consumer Electronics Association. ""Tech being vilified in San Francisco again.""  ""I find it ethically questionable, singling out individual people,"" says Enrico Moretti, a professor of economics at the University of California, Berkeley and the author of a book that estimates that every new tech job creates five additional jobs outside the tech sector. ""I don’t think it’s representative of how people feel about this. That said, I think it’s working."" The more obnoxious tactics do seem to be getting attention. In December, Max Bell Alper, a union organizer, pretended to be a Google employee yelling at protesters. He was initially condemned by other organizers, but some changed their minds after the video went viral. Protesters have continued to block buses on their way to work, but they most often grab headlines when there’s a twist. In Oakland, one group slashed a Google bus’ tires and threw a rock through its window, while another protester vomited on the windshield of a Yahoo shuttle. On Friday, a third Google employee was personally targeted by another protest led by a group called Eviction-Free San Francisco. Jack Halprin, an attorney at Google, attracted a small crowd of protesters to his home angry about his attempt to evict seven tenants, possibly so he can occupy the entire building himself. ""I don’t think it’s representative of how people feel about this. That said, I think it’s working."" ""I would draw the line around, if anybody was to get hurt,"" Erin McElroy of the Anti-Eviction Mapping Project, who was at the Halprin protest, says when asked which protest methods cross the line. ""I’m not opposed to pointing out certain higher-ups for what they’re doing by any means. I think that is effective."" Companies have started to respond to the unrest; Google made a donation to provide free public transportation for low-income youth. A growing class gap exists in San Francisco and, as with the Occupy Wall Street movement, the have-nots have found a target. The more extreme protests reflect a growing dissatisfaction that is reinforced every time the disenfranchised see a tech shuttle make its daily rounds or read about school teachers and disabled children being given a 90-day notice to leave their homes.  The Counterforce is definitely a fringe element. The question is whether it could be an indication of what’s to come if the class gap persists or gets worse. The group is confident it is at the precipice of a complete anarcho-primitivist rebellion against the technocracy. ""Get ready for a revolution neither you nor we can control, a revolution that will spread to all of the poor, exploited, and degraded members of this new tech society and be directed towards you for your bad decisions and irresponsible activities,"" the group wrote in an open letter to Google. ""We advise you to take us seriously.""",0.4589475629804732,0.5410524370195269,0.8294552796131743,1449,5.124913733609386,784,6.454081632653061,1,0,"Business, Culture, Tech, Report",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

The company reported a quarterly revenue of $1.13 billion with earnings of 38 cents per share. That was slightly better than analysts predicated, but it doesn't matter much. As Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Youssef Squali says, the consensus was for Yahoo ""to report another muted quarter ... in line with expectations."" What investors were really concerned about was the action happening on the other side of the world; Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba is expected to go public in the US this year with the biggest IPO since Facebook. Yahoo, which has a 24 percent stake in the company, provides some of the only hard data available on Alibaba's private finances, a window into a fast growing titan that is expected to be worth more than $100 billion in the US markets. Unlike Yahoo, Alibaba has been experiencing strong growth. It reported a 51 percent increase in year-over-year revenue last quarter, while Yahoo saw its revenue fall 2 percent over the same period. In comparison to Yahoo, Alibaba was quite profitable last year, reporting a net income of $800 million, a profit margin of 45 percent. According to The Motley Fool, in 2013 Yahoo's earnings from Alibaba and Yahoo Japan increased 33 percent to $897 million, which represents 65 percent of its net income for the year. This quarter Alibaba did even better. Revenue for the period grew 66 percent year over year and net income was up 110 percent, to $ 1.63 billion. That means Alibaba's quarterly revenue for the three-month period of October through December of 2013 was bigger than  any quarter Yahoo has reported in the last year. Despite its lackluster performance this quarter, Yahoo's stock was trading up more than 10 percent after hours based on Alibaba's impressive numbers. The student has officially become the master, a shift that will enrich both companies when Alibaba finally goes public sometime in the next year.

Ask them whether organic is better, however, and nine of them will say that it is. That’s the data coming from Walmart’s internal research, which found that 91 percent of the giant American retailer’s customers would opt for organic foods if their prices were lower than they currently are. Never one to neglect market demand, Walmart has acted today with the introduction of a new Wild Oats range that promises to save shoppers over 25 percent when compared to buying better known organic food brands. The USDA has an exhaustive checklist of conditions to be satisfied by organic produce, spanning the entire course of farming, processing, and storing of food. The key prohibitions rule out the use of hormones, antibiotics, and GMOs. Wild Oats, whose products are going national with today’s deal after selling only in select Fresh & Easy stores in California, says that all of its organic-branded items are USDA-certified. They’re mostly pantry fillers at the moment — such as condiments, snacks, and canned vegetables — but the company’s looking into expanding the selection to include fresh produce as well.  ""We know our customers are interested in purchasing organic products and, traditionally, those customers have had to pay more … We are changing that."" — Jack Sinclair, Executive VP, Grocery, Walmart. Walmart's an unlikely ambassador for the health benefits of organic food The benefits (and even the definition) of organic food can often be a source of controversy, but even so, Walmart’s reputation makes it an unlikely candidate for spreading awareness of the issue. The company’s brutal cost efficiency and aggressive pricing have been the subject of widespread criticism: from being satirized in South Park to investigative documentaries questioning its employment practices. It’s a business built on vast economies of scale looking to sell and promote products whose defining characteristic is a less intensive mode of production. The two would seem to be mutually exclusive. Unsurprisingly, Walmart’s groceries boss sees no contradiction in its newly unveiled plans. Jack Sinclair, who’s been with Walmart since 2007 following stints at Tesco and Safeway in the UK, describes what the company is doing as ""a win, win, win."" Customers will get lower prices on something they want, suppliers will have the assurance of consistent demand, and Walmart itself benefits from the halo effect of being associated with healthful foods. Sinclair sees massive inefficiencies in the organic supply chain and believes that by skipping out the industry’s middlemen and placing direct orders with suppliers of the raw goods, Walmart can secure that trifecta of advantageous outcomes. Cheaper prices today for higher profits tomorrow This may come at a significant initial cost to Walmart, but sales of organics are increasing notably faster than conventional foods and Walmart’s keen to seize the initiative in a growing category. If it can establish itself as a leader, the retail giant may be able to soften its severe public image while also counting the profits of a smart early investment. Over the past few years, Walmart’s been engaged in a series of projects to rectify its negative brand perception, which the Wild Oats range slots neatly into. Last year, US First Lady Michelle Obama visited a Walmart Neighborhood Market — a smaller, more intimate version of its stores — to commend efforts made toward reducing sugar content and improving the quality and variety of groceries sold by the retailer. Now the company is setting out to price what’s been typically a premium subset of products at the same level as the regular stuff. A $29 billion industry set for a shakeup Although it’s embracing some aspects of the health-conscious food culture that’s spreading throughout the United States, Walmart is mindful not to actively subscribe to it. ""This isn’t about telling our customers what to eat,"" says Sinclair, but rather about broadening the choice they have within the scope of their budget. The conservative corporate spirit remains strong at Walmart, but there’s no denying the potential for everyone to benefit from lower prices of organic foods. If Whole Foods — the specialist health food retailer that bought Wild Oats in 2007 before selling it on the brand in 2009 — feels the pressure to compete, Walmart’s trailblazing ways could have an even wider effect than its 4,000 grocery-selling stores in the US. On the other hand, the omnipresent threat with Walmart is that it will strangle competition by exploiting its great scale and end up operating a de facto monopoly. The one cause to be more optimistic today is that, should Walmart’s plans succeed and sales increase as the company anticipates, organic farmers around the US will have reason to expand their production and thus reduce costs through their own economies of scale — meaning they’d be able to charge less to anyone seeking to compete with Walmart’s prices. The wolf of Main Street already dominates America’s groceries market. Now it wants to wrest control of one of the pillars of the premium segment as well, and its sheer size and influence look set to give the $29 billion organic food industry its biggest shakeup in years.",0.8674004810091804,0.13259951899081956,0.5024871420945889,877,5.2109464082098063,496,6.368951612903226,0,0,"Business, US & World, Report",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

I take a left turn down Calle San Pablo into an unassuming industrial park, the research and development center for Cool Planet, a young company that claims it can use leftover plants to produce a miraculous fuel: a $1.50 gallon of gasoline that also bolsters sustainable agriculture and even combats climate change.  I’m here to meet Mike Cheiky, the founder of Cool Planet and a prolific inventor and entrepreneur. In 1975, he started Ohio Scientific, one of the earliest personal-computing companies. He followed that with a string of startups whose innovations included biofuels, touchscreens, batteries, voice recognition, and fuel injectors.  Cheiky’s ventures have always done well raising money. Two weeks ago Cool Planet announced a $100 million round of funding from names like Google Ventures, British Petroleum, General Electric, and ConocoPhillips. All told, his last three companies — Cool Planet, Zpower, and Transonic — have raised at least $300 million from some of the biggest players in Silicon Valley.  A cheap liquid fuel that “reverses global warming,” as Cheiky puts it, seems like a fantasy. But the venture capitalists he works with are eager to open their checkbooks for ideas that everyone but the entrepreneur deems impossible. “People always say it sounds too good to be true,” says Wesley Chan, who led Google Ventures’ initial investment in Cool Planet. “That is exactly the kind of company I get excited about as a venture capitalist. We’re in the business of making big bets.”  The company's critics agree with Chan on one thing. “People say it sounds too good to be true because it probably is,” says Robert Rapier, a chemical engineer and the managing editor of Energy Trends Insider. “What Cool Planet is claiming, that is pretty much like saying if you raise the temperature and pressure enough, you can turn water into wine.”   Cheiky’s former employees have a more troubling take. “He is either the world’s most unheralded genius, or he’s criminally insane,” says a former Transonic engineer. “One thing is for sure. He is undeniably very good at parting investors from their money.”  Cheiky’s private lab, referred to by employees as the Batcave, sits behind the Cool Planet building and across the street from Transonic his fuel-injector company. Zpower, the battery company he founded, was also headquartered here for years and is now a few miles away. Cheiky no longer works for any of them, preferring, he says, to research, innovate, and then pursue the next project. Still you get the sense, walking around, that he views them all as part of his domain. He greets me with a firm handshake, an imposing figure at roughly 6-foot-3 and 250 pounds. Cheiky sports an epic combover of dark black hair and tinted glasses that magnify his eyes — a mad scientist crossed with a linebacker. The first thing I see, walking into the lab, is his lavish collection of rare cars and motorcycles, including two Ferraris, a Maserati, and a Ford Cobra. Down the hall he’s built a museum celebrating his accomplishments. The showpiece is the Ohio Scientific Challenger II, the best known unit from the company Cheiky created just after graduating with a BA in physics — his only academic degree — from Ohio’s Hiram College. In 1981, Cheiky says he sold that company for around $10 million. ""We were the first personal-computer company to really cash out,"" he explains. From there, he takes me on a dizzying tour of his subsequent inventions. ""This was 1981, and we had a touchscreen with icons displayed as floating tiles,"" he says, gesturing to a brochure featuring a computer system called Centerpoint. ""Basically an iPad in 1981."" After that came work on natural-language agents. ""We had a Siri-type interface working by say 1993, ‘94. Except ours was called Si,"" he explains. ""You know, exactly like Siri!"" Next he shows me photos from his electric car company, DEMI, which built the zinc-air battery that won a NASCAR-style race organized by the US Department of Energy in 1991. ""The team that came in third, they became Tesla,"" Cheiky recalls with a grin. The idea that he could have been a tech-industry titan has always nagged at Cheiky. ""We were about six months too soon,"" he says of selling Ohio Scientific. According to Cheiky, Steve Wozniak used some of Ohio Scientific’s technology to build the Apple II. It’s one of many moments he relates that seems to tie Cheiky to the icons of Silicon Valley. ""We were moderately successful, but had we been plugged into the California Intel scene, we probably would have been Dell."" Silicon Valley is fond of a parable called the founder’s dilemma. It’s the notion that the people who are especially good at creating companies, the thinkers who chase after seemingly impossible ideas and inspire a team, aren’t always suited to run a more mature business. Finding and funding these thinkers is what venture capitalists do — you can always get a responsible CEO later to clean up the mess. Cheiky fits the archetype of this itinerant genius to a T. ""[Mike] is an early stage guy, he’s got big ideas,"" explains Mike Rocke, Cheiky’s right-hand man, who’s worked alongside him at his last three companies. ""He starts things up, and then when things slow down and get into the commercialization aspect, he gets bored, and goes off and does something else."" Rocke, who walks with a slight limp and keeps his thinning gray hair tightly cropped, first met Cheiky when he was working as a venture capitalist for Intel in 2002. He led Intel’s investment in Cheiky’s third company, Zpower, then left shortly after and soon began working with Cheiky full time at Transonic. When describing Cheiky Rocke is effusive, even likening him to Thomas Edison. ""One of the things Mike can do is span all this invention and put things together for the next stage,"" Rocke says in an excited whisper. ""Nobody can put together disparate ideas like he can … this is renaissance stuff."" The two operate as something of a tag team: Rocke solicits investments while Cheiky is the public face of his companies and a compelling draw for investors — an eccentric scientist who’s built a reputation over 40 years and five companies, from Ohio Scientific to Cool Planet. But Cheiky’s entrepreneurial track record, and his science, aren’t quite what they seem. ""The guy is brilliant, there is no question. His IQ is probably in the 150s,"" says a former employee who worked closely with Cheiky at Transonic. ""The problem is he is using all the intelligence for evil."" In Cheiky’s telling, he’s a restless inventor who thrives on pure research, a man who enjoys founding companies but quickly grows tired and moves on. Current and former employees and executives at Cheiky’s companies dispute that. I spoke with more than a dozen of them on condition of anonymity, largely due to non-disclosure agreements, stock holdings in these companies, fear of litigation, and Cheiky’s allegedly explosive temper. According to some, Cheiky doesn’t leave his companies by choice, and has twice been pushed to resign from the companies he starts when board members and investors realize his research isn’t commercially viable. One former employee at Zpower, a company that makes zinc-air batteries, recalls that engineers would prototype and assemble new units every day. But each afternoon, Cheiky would have the new prototypes driven to his private lab, where he would test them without sharing the resulting data. ""It was total snake oil,"" says the engineer, who saw that data only after Cheiky left the company. ""He was selling a revolutionary new technology that wasn’t."" Others recalled that his attempts to massage data could become dangerous. One former Transonic engineer remembers an experiment in which gasoline was run over a catalyst inside a chemical reactor. ""He realized relatively quickly that he wasn’t getting the results he wanted ... he just started turning knobs left and right,"" the engineer says. ""I thought it was quite dangerous."" Cheiky pushed pressure and temperature above the safety limits this engineer had built in. ""It was the most chaotic experiment I’ve ever been involved with."" He did plenty of research, but according to former employees, Cheiky’s grasp on that work sometimes didn’t match his ambitious vision. ""There was definitely a way to create an interesting product there,"" says an engineer who worked at Transonic. ""But Mike didn’t have any real understanding of what was going on. He named the company Transonic because he had this idea that the combustion was happening at the speed of sound. That had absolutely nothing to do with it."" It wasn’t that Cheiky was clueless. According to one engineer from Cool Planet, Cheiky was adept at recruiting talent. He was also brilliant at spotting market opportunities and designing technology that suggested a revolutionary — and timely — breakthrough. His engineers all praised the big, conceptual ideas behind Transonic and Cool Planet. But Cheiky refused to accept when things weren’t working as he predicted. It fit a pattern common among passionate founders, says the former Cool Planet engineer, and holds true for Cheiky more than most. ""They have enough grasp of science to be dangerous, but not enough to accept they could be wrong."" After showing off his awards and patents, Cheiky leads me through the Batcave and back to his rows of cars and tables of lab equipment. He grabs two plants borrowed from Cool Planet: the more robust specimen was grown with a substance known as biochar, he tells me, the other without. Cheiky founded Cool Planet on the premise that he could break down plants into liquid fuel, water, and biochar, a sort of charcoal byproduct that can improve soil for agriculture. It’s why Cheiky claims his process doesn’t just make cheap fuel, but is also good for the environment. ""Biochar puts carbon back in the ground,"" he tells me. ""It holds more water and it’s also sequestering CO2. That's reverse global warming. That's the magic compound. I consider it the most important work I’ve ever done."" As the long oral history of Cheiky’s many accomplishments winds down, I explain that after interviewing former employees, I heard repeatedly that he was forced out of companies once investors discovered that his science didn't add up. He folds his arms across his chest, expression unchanged, barely missing a beat. ""When somebody comes in to the company to be the president, they want to take over,"" he says. ""People want to have extreme ownership, so they’ll come in and say whatever was done before was no good."" So why does he leave these companies after a few years? ""I'm the lab guy, I'm on to the next thing,"" he says. ""I've made lots of money, couple of yachts, lots of houses, and high-performance sports cars, but I really love working in the laboratory. That's my mission. To be the first person to do something."" I press him on the science behind Cool Planet. What about quantum chemistry, an esoteric and largely theoretical field, that he boasted was key to the company’s technology during a talk at Google’s Solve For X event? He responds with a bewildering string of scientific terms: zeolite catalysts, quantum wells, substitute benzene rings, angstroms, and hydrocarbon fragments. ""This is not mystical or anything, this is standard quantum chemistry,"" he adds. ""There is nothing novel or controversial about it. It’s just one of the many thousands of fields you need to have expertise in to do something like this."" I later run his comments by three experts, including professors in quantum chemistry and zeolite catalysts. They tell me Cheiky’s got his science a bit mixed up and is making exaggerated claims. But it’s not until I call the University of Wisconsin that I really find the smoking gun. I reach William Banholzer, PhD, a chemical engineer who previously spent eight years as the chief technology officer at Dow Chemical. ""I actually use Cool Planet as a teaching example of outrageous claims that defy common sense,"" Banholzer says. He means that quite literally: Banholzer has created a PowerPoint presentation using Cheiky’s claims from his Google Solve for X talk, along with early Cool Planet presentations and charts. He doesn’t need to know exactly how Cheiky’s patented process works to conclude that it’s wrong: there simply isn’t enough energy in most plants to get the quantity and quality of fuel Cheiky claims he can produce. ""And if you’re going to make biochar,"" says Banholzer, ""everything I just said about the amount of plant material you’d need gets even worse."" Banholzer is uniquely qualified to assess whether someone is selling snake oil or pitching solid science. In addition to working as Dow Chemical’s CTO, he spent years helping to manage its venture capital arm. He saw hundreds of companies claim to have amazing new technology and learned to separate fact from fiction. His lesson on Cool Planet is meant to help business students do the same. ""Students get sucked in, because they want to believe,"" says Banholzer. ""They see GE and these other big people put their money in. Because these companies put their money in, the students immediately jump to the idea, ‘Oh well they must know what they’re doing, it means there is something pretty good there.’ So I use Cool Planet as an example of ‘Don’t forget your engineering.’"" Executives at Zpower, Transonic, and Cool Planet all say they’ve significantly changed or improved on their company’s core technology since Cheiky left. Transonic and Cool Planet executives added that they no longer rely on his patented ""breakthroughs"" as the core of their business at all. When asked about the claims Banholzer had dissected, Cool Planet’s new CEO Howard Janzen told me: ""Some of those claims were in the very early days of the company, and since the time that I’ve been here we’ve been very careful to try and be accurate with the statements we put out, and that has not been one of the things we put out."" They’ve distanced themselves from Cheiky, so why do Transonic and Cool Planet continue to operate next to his private lab, in the tiny kingdom he’s been building for decades? In part, it’s because Cheiky’s reputation has thus far been an asset to these companies rather than a risk. Cool Planet says it’s moved away from his technology, for example, but the company still has many of his claims, slides, and patents on its website. Even Mike Rocke, who lauded Cheiky’s brilliance several times, admitted in a phone call after my visit that some of Cheiky’s work in the lab was shaky at best. ""Let’s get this straight. What I admire and respect Mike for is his early thoughts and innovation, okay?"" After all, Rocke points out, creating viable companies isn’t easy. ""I’ve been with these different companies and watched a lot of them not commercialize, or struggle to commercialize,"" Rocke says. ""I’m a mechanical engineer and there are issues with his stuff. But the thing is, the initial ideas are the ideas that I like, the science and how do you get this proven, sometimes it doesn’t work out. Sometimes it’s not good. Sometimes it isn’t good science or it’s not provable science."" I later email this quote about ""bad science"" to Cheiky, who took it as a compliment. ""So, my approach in early-stage development is to cover a lot of ground with very little money by flying through the test process and only cherry-picking for the most interesting and promising candidates for further later-stage work,"" he wrote. ""I contend that this is not bad science, it is simply a super lean management style to move the company forward very fast with limited resources."" How is it possible that so many smart people, from Silicon Valley’s top venture firms to the world’s biggest energy companies, were compelled by Cheiky’s claims for so long? And if Cheiky really was pushed out of at least two companies, Transonic and Zpower, why didn’t any of his investors raise the alarm when he tried to attract new venture capital? Part of the answer is that venture capital is arguably the perfect target for a smart, confident man with an impressive background: it’s an industry built on placing bets that sound impossible, and often won’t pay off for years or even decades. It’s about being on the hunt for something that sounds too good to be true. And for the last 12 years, Cheiky and his partner Rocke have been pitching just that. And what about all the due diligence his investors did on the science? Even the firms that specialize in energy can be fooled, says Banholzer. ""They have a lot of investment guys, who are like bankers, and they don’t use their engineering talent to do due diligence."" The venture capitalists who’ve sunk tens of millions into Cheiky’s startups have a lot to lose if his suspect science is discovered — exposing Cheiky might stop him from raising money again, but it would also tarnish their reputations. None of the firms who backed Cheiky would speak with The Verge about him on the record, but several shared negative impressions on background. Unlike many serial entrepreneurs, who return to previous investors for favorable terms, Cheiky’s last three startups all have a very different set of backers. Back in the Batcave, Cheiky and Mike Rocke start bragging about their latest round of funding. ""I went from 50 cents a share very quickly, to $1 very quickly, to $2, and this new raise is on that same line,"" Cheiky tells me of Cool Planet’s recent $100 million funding. Gesturing to Rocke he asks, ""Have you told him what the valuation is? It’s in the stratosphere."" ""A $100 million-dollar raise is more than most small companies do at an IPO,"" confirms Rocke with a smile. He must be doing well, I say, thanks to the shares he holds as founder of these companies. Cheiky’s entire demeanor changes. ""Oh,"" he says, ""I typically divest."" That’s odd, I say to the man who seconds earlier was bragging about the rapidly increasing value of Cool Planet’s shares. Doesn’t he want to reap rewards for the companies he creates? ""I’m the lab guy,"" he exclaims. ""I really am on to the next thing."" ""He’s not that much of a money guy,"" Rocke chimes in dutifully. Cheiky loves to play the role of inventor; someone only interested in doing great science with no concern for money. But during the two hours I spent with him, he happily chatted about his cars, yachts, private jets, and mansions. He didn’t have room in the Batcave, he explained, to park his newest toy, a Mercedes E63S that starts around $92,000.  But whenever I asked detailed questions about his wealth, he would change the subject back to his passion for pure research. ""I’m about being out there doing something nobody has ever done before,"" Cheiky intoned. ""Doing the best you can for mankind."" Cheiky’s next plan to help mankind is a startup called V-Grid. As he explained in a YouTube clip, the company’s goal is to revolutionize the electric grid, bringing cheap, renewable energy to millions around the world. The clip was pulled a few days before this story was published and edited to remove several seconds. In the original video, he claims to an audience of small investors that a team of backers, including Google, BP, and GE, and NorthBridge are already funding V-grid. Cheiky says the because he secured a loan from Cool Planet to start V-grid, all the investors in one company are essentially backers in another. Yet when I asked those same investors if they had ever heard of or funded V-Grid, all adamantly and repeatedly denied it. But with the ink barely dry on Cool Planet’s recent fundraising, Cheiky’s already got another dream to sell, another round of investors to pitch. Seeing big-name backers already committed gives small investors confidence that someone has done due diligence on his claims. As we wind down our day in the Batcave, Cheiky continues to hammer home the extent of his ongoing influence on the companies he’s founded, but no longer runs. ""From a big-picture perspective,"" he tells me, ""these companies have in the first line or two of their website exactly the mission statement that I set out for them."" It’s not his fault that the scientists who’ve followed him couldn’t make his technology work. Most people just aren’t as smart as him. ""If they make a mistake, they are too embarrassed to call,"" he explains. When it comes to revolutionary breakthroughs, Cheiky tells me, ""The devil’s in the details.""",0.6420507126579413,0.35794928734205866,0.8424844959984196,3489,5.0077386070507313,1434,6.5327754532775453,0,0,,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

Parker has even previously worked with politically minded startups, investing in Votizen before it was later purchased by a startup that he co-founded, Causes, according to Forbes.

The IAB says that mobile ads revenue experienced triple-digit growth for the third year in a row — in 2013, it was up 110 percent compared to 2012, reaching just over $7 billion in revenue. That's only 17 percent of total internet ad spending, but in 2012 mobile ads only accounted for nine percent of the internet ad landscape — and given consumer reliance on their smartphones, that number is likely to continue growing in the years to come.",0.5815878311702591,0.41841216882974086,0.7721052027975698,164,5.1341463414634143,113,5.6902654867256635,0,0,"Business, Web",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

It went on to point out details that The Verge and other sites found while combing through the terabytes of information leaked by the hacker group Guardians of Peace. Among other things, Sony and other members of the MPAA joined a campaign known as ""Project Goliath,"" a heavy-handed attempt to block pirate sites from appearing online. The project appeared after the conspicuous failure of SOPA, an anti-infringement bill that was widely protested and finally shelved in early 2012. Since then, the film industry has supposedly stepped back and tried a friendlier approach, but it's continued to go after Google, which it sees as enabling piracy. The leaked documents show that it aggressively pushed state attorneys general to go after Google, allocating funds and building potential legal cases against the search giant. ""While we of course have serious legal concerns about all of this, one disappointing part of this story is what this all means for the MPAA itself, an organization founded in part 'to promote and defend the First Amendment and artists' right to free expression,'"" wrote Google. ""Why, then, is it trying to secretly censor the Internet?"" The MPAA countered with a harsh response. ""Google's effort to position itself as a defender of free speech is shameful,"" said a spokesperson. ""Freedom of speech should never be used as a shield for unlawful activities and the internet is not a license to steal. Google's blog post today is a transparent attempt to deflect focus from its own conduct and to shift attention from legitimate and important ongoing investigations by state attorneys general into the role of Google Search in enabling and facilitating illegal conduct — including illicit drug purchases, human trafficking and fraudulent documents as well as theft of intellectual property.

As first spotted by The Wall Street Journal, the transportation company has agreed to close up shop within the city's confines for three months while Portland makes changes to its private car regulations. As part of the deal, the city will allow ride-sharing companies to operate after April 9th, 2015 if updated regulations are not made, but not until then. Uber says it plans to stop its own pick-ups the evening of Sunday, December 21st. ""Uber is dedicated to curating and continuing a valuable and constructive relationship with Portland's lawmakers, working to create a regulatory framework that works for everyone, not just us. Not just the taxi cabs. Not just the city officials. Everyone,"" the company said in a statement. Uber's launch took Portland by surprise In a press release, Portland's Mayor Charlie Hales said that a new task force will begin evaluating limits on permits for transportation network companies, as well as deciding on regulations for accessibility, pricing, vehicle inspections, background checks on drivers, and insurance requirements. Uber surprised Portland officials earlier this month by launching without the city's blessing, prompting a quick lawsuit, as well as a cease and desist order. Prior to the legal action, the city threatened fines of $1,500 against Uber (for the first offense) and up to $2,250 for the driver, climbing up to $5,000 for additional violations. For its part, Uber said it would support drivers who were fined. Despite that, enforcement within Portland's borders has been complicated due to its proximity to neighboring cities where Uber is allowed, including right across the bridge in Vancouver, Washington. Drivers in those places can pick passengers up and drop them off into Portland within minutes, but not pick up someone else who may have hired a car. Uber says that more than 10,000 rides have been delivered in Portland since the service launched there, with some 300 new drivers signing up. Those drivers will need to sit tight or start picking up in neighboring cities like Beaverton, Gresham, Hillsboro, and Tigard until operations within Portland resume.

But while the documents showed how bad things had gotten between Google and Hollywood, they also showed how eagerly many state attorneys general took up the MPAA’s anti-Google crusade – particularly Mississippi’s Jim Hood. And less than a week after the documents were made public, that eagerness is starting to have real consequences. Hood has been at the center of many of the recent legal actions against Google in the US, investigating the company for involvement in both pharmaceutical counterfeiting and content piracy, but never assembling enough evidence for concrete charges. But on Tuesday, The New York Times revealed the MPAA may have had more of a hand in his actions than he let on. According to Times documents, a November 2013 letter Hood wrote criticizing Google for aiding piracy was almost entirely copied from text provided to him by lawyers working for the MPAA. In short, Hood’s lips were moving, but it was the MPAA’s approved text coming out. Other emails show specific requests from Hood circulating among MPAA lawyers. In an email sent on January 16th, a few days before a scheduled meeting between Google and a group of attorneys general, MPAA counsel Vans Stevenson discusses which supporting documents they can provide to Hood and the other AGs in advance.  [Attorney] General Hood called me last night and asked that we provide fresh examples for his planned live ""search"" demonstration of illegal site activity, including the availability of motion pictures only in theatrical release, which we are working on with our [outside counsel] Tom Perrelli’s team. A few days later, on the 21st, an email from Perrelli talks about coaching Hood before the meeting: I spent more time with Hood after the meeting and, I hope, got him focused on the key issues and the asks.  He really does care a great deal about piracy – and he doesn’t get sidetracked by some of the things that Microsoft prefers. He wants Google to delist pirate sites and he is going to ask them to do that tomorrow. Taken together with other documents, it makes a strong case that Hood was being directed by both the MPAA and Microsoft in his investigations into Google, and casts many of those investigations in a new light. Hollywood has also been a lucrative source of campaign donations for Hood. Last year, he received $3,000 from Comcast and NBC Universal, along with $1,000 from 21st Century Fox. The MPAA’s Illinois PAC also gave $2,500 to an independent campaign group called Friends of Jim Hood. Hood, for his part, has denied any impropriety. Reached by The Huffington Post, Hood said he had spoken with Perrelli but was not aware of any relationship between Perrelli and the MPAA or Jenner & Block.

In an internal email to UK employees obtained by the Telegraph, Jeff Williams, Apple senior vice president of operations, wrote that both he and Cook are ""deeply offended by the suggestion that Apple would break a promise to the workers in our supply chain or mislead our customers in any way."" The email was in response to a BBC documentary released this week, in which undercover journalists working at a Pegatron factory in Shanghai reported that workers there were subjected to long hours without breaks, and under cramped living conditions. In the email, Williams said that the hour-long documentary ""implied that Apple isn’t improving working conditions. Let me tell you, nothing could be further from the truth."" He went on to say that the company provided the BBC with ""facts and perspective"" on its efforts to improve working conditions throughout its supply chain, but that input was ""clearly missing from their programme."" ""Let me tell you, nothing could be further from the truth."" The plant in question manufactures iPads and iPhones for Apple, which employs around 1,400 workers across China. The BBC reported that employees there were forced to work shifts that lasted up to 16 hours, and that some worked 18 days in a row after their requests for time off were denied. One reporter was made to share a small dorm with 11 other workers. Apple and other technology companies have come under increased scrutiny in recent years for alleged labor abuses in their supply chains, most notoriously at plants owned by Foxconn. Last year, a labor rights watchdog accused Pegatron of committing safety and environmental violations at its factories, in addition to labor abuse allegations that are similar to what the BBC reported this week. In response, Apple has increased efforts to monitor and regulate its supply chain, as detailed in its annual supplier responsibility reports. In the internal email, Williams noted that the company has tracked the working hours of more than 1 million supply chain workers, and that 93 percent comply with the mandated 60-hour working week limit, though he acknowledged that there's room for improvement. ""We can still do better. And we will,"" he wrote. ""We can still do better. And we will."" The BBC investigation also reported that tin from an illegal mine in Indonesia may be making its way into Apple's supply chain, with some of the mines employing child laborers under unsafe working conditions. In the email, Williams contests that Apple has publicly acknowledged that ""tin from Indonesia ends up in our products, and some of that tin likely comes from illegal mines,"" and that the company has visited the region and is ""appalled by what's going on there."" He added that Apple is actively working to hold tin suppliers accountable, after having created an Indonesian Tin Working Group with other tech companies. ""Apple has two choices: We could make sure all of our suppliers buy tin from smelters outside of Indonesia, which would probably be the easiest thing for us to do and would certainly shield us from criticism,"" Williams wrote. ""But it would be the lazy and cowardly path, because it would do nothing to improve the situation for Indonesian workers or the environment since Apple consumes a tiny fraction of the tin mined there. We chose the second path, which is to stay engaged and try to drive a collective solution."" Williams' full email is below. UK Team, As you know, Apple is dedicated to the advancement of human rights and equality around the world. We are honest about the challenges we face and we work hard to make sure that people who make our products are treated with the dignity and respect they deserve. Last night, the BBC’s Panorama program called those values into question. Like many of you, Tim and I were deeply offended by the suggestion that Apple would break a promise to the workers in our supply chain or mislead our customers in any way. I’d like to give you facts and perspective, all of which we shared with the BBC in advance, but were clearly missing from their program. Panorama showed some of the shocking conditions around tin mining in Indonesia. Apple has publicly stated that tin from Indonesia ends up in our products, and some of that tin likely comes from illegal mines. Here are the facts: Tens of thousands of artisanal miners are selling tin through many middlemen to the smelters who supply to component suppliers who sell to the world. The government is not addressing the issue, and there is widespread corruption in the undeveloped supply chain. Our team visited the same parts of Indonesia visited by the BBC, and of course we are appalled by what’s going on there. Apple has two choices: We could make sure all of our suppliers buy tin from smelters outside of Indonesia, which would probably be the easiest thing for us to do and would certainly shield us from criticism. But it would be the lazy and cowardly path, because it would do nothing to improve the situation for Indonesian workers or the environment since Apple consumes a tiny fraction of the tin mined there. We chose the second path, which is to stay engaged and try to drive a collective solution. We spearheaded the creation of an Indonesian Tin Working Group with other technology companies. Apple is pushing to find and implement a system that holds smelters accountable so we can influence artisanal mining in Indonesia. It could be an approach such as ""bagging and tagging"" legally mined material, which has been successful over time in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. We are looking to drive similar results in Indonesia, which is the right thing to do. Panorama also made claims about our commitment to working conditions in our factories. We know of no other company doing as much as Apple does to ensure fair and safe working conditions, to discover and investigate problems, to fix and follow through when issues arise, and to provide transparency into the operations of our suppliers. I want you to know that more than 1400 of your Apple coworkers are stationed in China to manage our manufacturing operations. They are in the factories constantly — talented engineers and managers who are also compassionate people, trained to speak up when they see safety risks or mistreatment. We also have a team of experts dedicated solely to driving compliance with our Supplier Code of Conduct across our vast supply chain. In 2014 alone, our Supplier Responsibility team completed 630 comprehensive, in-person audits deep into our supply chain. These audits include face-to-face interviews with workers, away from their managers, in their native language. Sometimes critics point to the discovery of problems as evidence that the process isn’t working. The reality is that we find violations in every audit we have ever performed, no matter how sophisticated the company we're auditing. We find problems, we drive improvement, and then we raise the bar. Panorama’s report implied that Apple isn’t improving working conditions. Let me tell you, nothing could be further from the truth. Here are just a few examples: Several years ago, the vast majority of workers in our supply chain worked in excess of 60 hours, and 70+ hour workweeks were typical. After years of slow progress and industry excuses, Apple decided to attack the problem by tracking the weekly hours of over one million workers, driving corrective actions with our suppliers and publishing the results on our website monthly — something no other company had ever done. It takes substantial effort, and we have to weed out false reporting, but it's working. This year, our suppliers have achieved an average of 93% compliance with our 60-hour limit. We can still do better. And we will. Our auditors were the first to identify and crack down on a ring of unscrupulous labor brokers who were holding workers’ passports and forcing them to pay exorbitant fees. To date, we have helped workers recoup $20 million in excessive payments like these. We’ve gone far beyond auditing and corrective actions by creating educational programs for workers in the same facilities where they make our products. More than 750,000 people have taken advantage of these college-level courses and enrichment programs, and the feedback we get from students is inspiring. I will not dive into every issue raised by Panorama in this note, but you can rest assured that we take all allegations seriously, and we investigate every claim. We know there are a lot of issues out there, and our work is never done. We will not rest until every person in our supply chain is treated with the respect and dignity they deserve. If you’d like to learn more about our Supplier Responsibility program, I encourage you and our customers to visit our website at apple.com/supplierresponsibility.

The request was filed by the Associated Press, Bloomberg, and CNN during this month's trial over security measures Apple added to iTunes and iPods nearly a decade ago, where 27-minutes of the deposition was shown in court. The request prompted a heated three-way debate over whether making the video available outside the courtroom would run afoul with federal laws prohibiting the recording of courtroom proceedings. The public would have ""special access"" if the video were to be made available In a ruling today, US district court judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers said that the video should be treated just like any other testimony in that particular federal circuit, and thus unable to be made public as a recording. ""The Jobs Deposition was merely presented in lieu of live testimony due to the witness's unavailability, and was and should be treated in the same manner as any other live testimony offered at trial,"" Rogers wrote. She added that by releasing it, ""the public would have special access to videos that would not even be available to the court of appeals in the appellate record."" The testimony itself was filmed in early 2011, just months before Jobs died from cancer, and brought out by the plaintiffs in the case to paint the picture that Apple was a massive company by the time it started making changes to its software that potentially kept out competitors. A jury ultimately disagreed with that assessment, deciding yesterday that the version of iTunes that Apple released with those features in 2006 could be considered a ""genuine product improvement"" over the one that came before it. In his deposition, Jobs explained that Apple was required to implement its FairPlay DRM software in iTunes and on iPods primarily because of its deals with record companies. He also said that any changes Apple made were because of ""black and white"" deals it had with the labels, and that the company ""went to great pains"" to make sure people couldn't hack its system. ""Steve Jobs is not your typical trial witness."" The media companies' lawyer had argued that ""Steve Jobs is not your typical trial witness,"" and that what the late executive said during the video was ""invaluable."" Apple's own lawyers vehemently disagreed, calling the companies — though specifically CNN — opportunistic. ""The marginal value of seeing him again, in his black turtleneck — this time very sick — is small,"" Jonathan Sherman, a partner at law firm Boies, Schiller, and Flexner said. ""What they they want is a dead man, and they want to show him to the rest of the world, because it's a judicial record."" Judge Rogers signaled her decision in earlier court proceedings when the matter was discussed, noting that she hadn't been recording any of the other witnesses, making the release of the Jobs testimony problematic. ""The request you're asking for frankly is diametrically opposed from the rule that says I cannot allow the recording of these proceedings,"" she said. ""So if I'm treating witnesses the same, I haven't recorded any of the experts, I haven't recorded anything — and none of that's going to go to the jury."" The video could ultimately end up being brought out again as part of an appeal, which the plaintiffs in the case said they plan to file sometime within the next month.",0.28857139313651464,0.7114286068634854,0.8599568673343336,591,4.9289340101522843,310,5.9967741935483874,0,0,"Apple, Policy & Law, Tech, US & World",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

The attackers seem to have pulled whatever was available on the company servers, but that adds up to a lot of sensitive and previously secret information. Private emails from Sony executives revealed huge infighting over the pre-production of the movie Jobs, as well as Snapchat's attempts to launch a music label. The leaks also revealed more troubling anti-piracy efforts from the MPAA, including a coordinated campaign against Google. The most sensitive data so far has been the social security numbers of 47,000 employees, including celebrities like Sylvester Stallone and Judd Apatow, which may be used as fodder for identity theft attacks for years to come. According to the FBI, it was the work of North Korea's cyberattack squad. The FBI report points to ""significant overlap"" in both the methods and the infrastructure used in this hack and a 2013 attack on banks and other infrastructure in Seoul, an attack that was widely attributed to North Korea. ""There were similarities in specific lines of code, encryption algorithms, data deletion methods, and compromised networks,"" the report reads. There's also a reference to further evidence from ""sensitive sources and methods"" that hasn't been included in the report, which has been widely taken as a reference to data pulled from the NSA's web monitoring tools. North Korea is also the only party with a clear motive. Earlier this summer, North Korea had threatened retaliation for the release of The Interview, a comedy depicting the assassination of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. Later messages from the attackers also called for Sony to halt the release of the film. After the attacks began, North Korean officials denied that the country was responsible, but called the attacks ""a righteous deed"" and openly applauded whoever was responsible. Very damaging! Just repairing the computer system and protecting employees will cost tens of millions, and the total damage is likely to top $100 million. Strategies were revealed, early deals squished, and for nearly a month, employees were threatened and terrorized by anonymous hackers. Sony is already facing two separate lawsuits from employees who say the company didn't do enough to protect their private information. Then there's the simple reputation damage: in one leaked email, mega-producer Scott Rudin called Angelina Jolie a ""minimally talented spoiled brat"" — how do you put a price tag on that? Then there's also the ongoing fallout from the cancelled release of The Interview, announced on Wednesday... At first, the hack didn't put much of a dent in The Interview's release schedule — star Seth Rogen even joked about the attacks on Saturday Night Live. That changed on Tuesday, when the hackers threatened terror attacks on theaters showing the film. (The message was posted anonymously, but came along with fresh data from Sony servers, suggesting it came from the same attackers.) Sony reacted by canceling the film's New York premiere as well as many of the accompanying press appearances. The studio didn't officially cancel the release, but it gave theater owners permission to cancel screenings if they felt security was a concern. In response, nearly every major US theater chain pulled the film, and Sony officially canceled the release shortly after. As it stands now, it's unclear whether the film will ever be seen again. The attackers have demanded that the studio erase every existing trace of the film to prevent further leaks, and for now, the studio seems to be complying with the demand. Some have called for an online release, but the studio has responded by saying that no online service has stepped forward to distribute the film -- an implausible claim, since Sony owns the online distribution service Crackle. Nonetheless, Sony Pictures CEO Michael Lynton maintains that the studio wants to release the film. The only question is how and when. They're still working it out! We've never had a hack this messy or public before, and politicians are still figuring out what to do. In a press conference on Friday, President Obama promised a response to the attack, but gave few details beyond that, saying: ""We will respond proportionately and we'll respond in a place and time and manner that we choose."" Still, it's unclear what a proportionate response to a cyberattack might look like, and North Korea's continued isolation from the international community has made many observers skeptical that the country will face any meaningful repercussions. At the same time, President Obama urged Congress to act on a new cybersecurity law to defend against attacks like this in the future. The details of the proposal are still unclear, but many are already taking it as an excuse to limit web freedoms in the name of security. With an increasingly hostile Congress arriving in the new year, the fate of the bill remains uncertain. 12/19 5:34pm ET: Updated to reflect the FBI statement, the president's press conference and other developments",0.5078834706495465,0.49211652935045347,0.8500370758140519,968,5.1167355371900829,523,6.3135755258126194,0,0,"US & World, National Security",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

Especially because the group threatened violence if Sony released its North Korea-focused comedy The Interview, this could turn the issue from a major security problem to an international incident, and American politicians have begun formulating their responses — whether that's simple condemnation or calls for new cybersecurity bills. The White House hasn't said anything about the hacks, or publicly attributed them to North Korea. But Congress members and others have been less circumspect. Representative Peter King (R-NY) called for legislators to pass the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act, which reimburses insurers for terrorism-related losses. The policy was adopted after September 11th, but an extension failed to pass the Senate earlier this week, setting it to expire at the end of the year. King called an expiration ""criminal negligence."" And Rep. Ed Royce (R-CA), chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee, said in a CNN interview that Sony's decision to cancel The Interview's release was ""regrettable"" and dangerous. ""What message does this send other hackers, other state-sponsors of terrorism  — which North Korea is? That you get a little leverage in the system, you can make these demands and people cede to them."" Absolutely essential that Congress pass Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (#TRIA) as soon as possible. Criminal negligence not to. No excuses. Senator John McCain (R-AZ) also said that the choice set a ""troubling precedent"" in cyberwarfare. ""The administration's failure to deter our adversaries has emboldened, and will continue to embolden, those seeking to harm the United States through cyberspace,"" he said in a statement. He reiterated promises to focus on the issue if elected chair of the Armed Services Committee, including plans to create a subcommittee for cybersecurity issues. ""Congress as a whole must also address these issues and finally pass long-overdue comprehensive cybersecurity legislation,"" he said. McCain has been pushing cybersecurity bills for years, including the Secure IT Act, a competitor to the controversial CISPA bill. In a statement on Tuesday, Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), a major proponent of cybersecurity and author of multiple bills, said that ""this is only the latest example of the need for serious legislation to improve the sharing of information between the private sector and the government to help companies strengthen cybersecurity. We must pass an information sharing bill as quickly as possible next year."" Cybersecurity legislation, which would establish a framework for US agencies and companies to share information on threats, has repeatedly stalled in Congress, in part because of privacy concerns — the White House ultimately issued an executive order on the issue in 2013. Nonetheless, Congress, the NSA, and others have warned of major cyberattacks for years. Intelligence agencies don't seem likely to speak until the White House gives an official statement, but former NSA head Keith Alexander significantly built out the agency's cyberwarfare capabilities, establishing and holding the position of US Cyber Command. He also called on Congress to pass a CISPA-style security bill. .@SonyPictures don’t cave, fight: release @TheInterview free online globally. Ask viewers for voluntary $5 contribution to fight #Ebola.  Former presidential candidate and Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney, meanwhile, has echoed a common refrain: Sony should undermine the hackers' goals by releasing The Interview through internet video services. ""Don't cave; fight,"" he wrote. ""Release @TheInterview free online globally."" Newt Gingrich said the same thing, saying that ""with the Sony collapse America has lost its first cyberwar.""

He's been trying to get it made since the late ’90s — Variety reports that he's made seven attempts in total — but this latest attempt may finally get it done. At least, a series of reports and quotes from Gilliam suggest as much. And the most surprising part: it may happen thanks to Amazon.  Is it really actually finally truly happening? Gilliam told Indiewire this week that Amazon is partially funding his adaptation, titled The Man Who Killed Don Quixote, and that it plans to stream the film following a short run in theaters. Assuming production doesn't go awry again — it can't happen again, right? — this would be a smart grab by Amazon. It might not attract wide attention, but it'll certainly get Amazon credit from cinephiles, which isn't a bad way to kick off its original film program. There hasn't been an official announcement from Amazon (perhaps it would rather wait, given the film's history), but the story seems to be adding up. Gilliam said back in August that his Don Quixote had funding, and Deadline later reported quite vaguely that he had a deal with Amazon. Now Gilliam is stitching the stories together. There's even been casting news, which at the very least shows that there's real movement here. The film is, once again, supposed to shoot next year. Entertainment Weekly reports that it received confirmation of the news from Amazon. Perhaps it shouldn't be so surprising that it took a new media company looking to make a name for itself to make this risky, fan-favorite project start heading toward reality again. It's essentially the same strategy Netflix took when it restarted Arrested Development or, to a lesser extent, that Hulu is trying to take with The Mindy Project. It may not appeal to an enormous audience, but it makes people pay attention. Gilliam's Quixote has had an unfortunate history And Gilliam fans have certainly been paying attention to the long and strange journey that The Man Who Killed Don Quixote has taken on its way to the screen. In the late ’90s, Gilliam began work on the project and eventually started filming, in 2000, with Johnny Depp in the lead role. A series of issues, including flash floods that destroyed sets, quickly caused production to shut down. Since then, Gilliam has tried unsuccessfully to get the movie going again with different actors. Now, even the script is different. ""I keep incorporating my own life into it and shifting it,"" Gilliam told The Wrap in August. ""The basic underlying premise of the version Johnny was involved in was that he actually was going to be transported back to the 17th century, and now it all takes place now, it’s contemporary. It’s more about how movies can damage people."" Basically, it sounds like the story is going meta and incorporating history of the failed Don Quixote into the new Don Quixote.

During the very first wave of real Oculus hype in 2013, everyone had... When Oculus Rift invited the media to a special event ahead of E3, it promised a handful of updates to prepare the world for what it expected to show off. Instead, it gave us an unexpected glimpse of not one but two pieces of hardware: the final design for the Oculus Rift consumer version, which will ship in the first quarter of next year, and a prototype of Oculus Touch, a next-generation input method that will enable future experiences inside virtual reality. Here's a look at the hardware... Alongside its consumer Rift, Oculus has announced a user interface for virtual reality.

But even if the Dreadnoughtus isn't quite the biggest, the fact that it can be measured with so much confidence speaks to the size of this find. Since first discovering bones in Argentina back in 2005, researchers have unearthed a tooth and 145 bones in total, coming from two separate individuals: 115 bones and a tooth from one, and 30 bones from the other. That's out of what's thought to be a total of 256 bones total in each individual. And if you don't count skull bones, which Drexel says are often discounted when measuring completeness, 110 types of bones out of just 142 types are accounted for in this find. Altogether, Drexel says that this discovery represents the most complete skeleton that's ever been found of a supermassive animal, and its bones are said to be ""exquisitely preserved.""  (Mark A.  Klingler, Carnegie Museum of Natural History) Titantosaurs, a type of sauropod, are a group of plant-eating dinosaurs with long necks and tails that walked around on four legs. The Dreadnoughtus lived on the southern tip of South America, and these particular skeletons were located in Patagonia. ""Dreadnoughtus schrani was astoundingly huge,"" Kenneth Lacovara, the Drexel professor who first found the fossil and lead research on it, says in a statement. ""It weighed as much as a dozen African elephants or more than seven T. rex. Shockingly, skeletal evidence shows that when this 65-ton specimen died, it was not yet full grown."" The researchers don't make a guess as to just how large Dreadnoughtus could have grown to be, and it's not clear how old the animal was when it died. 'Dreadnoughtus schrani' lab and excavation photosPreviousNextView full GalleryPreviousNext (Photos credit of Drexel University & Kenneth Lacovara) Though, like other sauropods, Dreadnoughtus was just an herbavore, Lacovara says that the enormous creature was still nothing to be trifled with. He wanted to give it a name that would signify just as much and landed on Dreadnoughtus, which is said to mean ""fears nothing."" ""I think it’s time the herbivores get their due for being the toughest creatures in an environment,"" he says. Lacovara describes Dreadnoughtus' typical day as involving standing in one place for hours on end, turning its neck, and eating basically everything green in sight. And because of its huge size, it probably really didn't have anything to fear from predators. If you want to get a closer look at Dreadnoughtus' bones, then you're in luck. Lacovara just happens to have an interest in scanning and 3D printing dinosaur bones — The Verge actually profiled the effort back in 2012 — and his lab has made scans of this latest find too. Alongside a paper that his research group is publishing today in the open-access journal Scientific Reports (which is run by Nature), the lab is publishing 3D scans of the skeleton for anyone to access as well. ""These images can be ported around the world to other scientists and museums,"" Lacovara says. ""The fidelity is perfect. It doesn’t decay over time like bones do in a collection."" Plus, they're a whole lot easier to pass around than a several-hundred pound bone.",0.3567641312329129,0.6432358687670872,0.49572627404260805,666,5.1051051051051051,373,6.1849865951742631,0,2,Science,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Tests showed quantum computers may be no faster than regular computers Quantum computing was fêted as the next step in computing technology, with quantum processors able to work out calculations in short periods of time that would take regular computers millions of years. But the technology took a hit earlier this year when tests on the world's first commercially available quantum computer — the D-Wave 2, priced at around $15 million — appeared to show that it was no faster than a standard computer. Tempering that discovery is a healthy debate about whether the D-Wave 2 is actually a quantum computer or not.

But the truth is that many factors come into play when determining what each individual’s morality rests upon. Conservatives, for instance, tend to hold loyalty and purity in the highest regard, whereas liberals are more likely to base moral acts on caring and fairness. Yet, the only reason we know that these trends exist is because scientists tested various scenarios in controlled, laboratory settings to see how various groups of people react. But a new study published today in Science has taken morality research out of the lab and into the streets, which means that we finally have an idea of how often humans encounter morally relevant situations and dilemmas in their every day lives. And, as it turns out, there's a lot more moral overlap between various groups — religious or nonreligious, for instance — than researchers previously thought. ""The methodology is really novel,"" says Dan Wisneski, a psychologist at Saint Peter's University and a co-author of the study. ""A lot of previous moral and ethics studies have taken place in the lab, in a controlled setting, and although these are important, we wanted to take those findings and compare it against people's everyday moral reality."" In the study, 1252 American and Canadian adults answered surveys about their experiences with morality for a period of three days. The surveys were initiated by text message five times a day at random intervals, and each provided a link to a survey that asked participants if they had experienced, witnessed, performed or learned of a moral or immoral act in the last hour. If they had, they were asked to describe that event. And each time they submitted a survey, they were entered in a contest to win a prize. Committing a moral act means you're likely to do let yourself do something wrong afterwards Once the answers were submitted, the researchers assigned it a single, specific category, all of which were based on the ""moral foundations theory"" — a theory that bases morality on eight basic foundations, including fairness, loyalty, authority, sanctity, and liberty. ""We were able to take those open ended responses and code them,"" Wisneski says, by assigning a foundation to each description. ""We tried to pick the ones that we thought fitted best,"" Wisneski says, but that wasn't always easy. ""For example, if we decided to code ‘I cheated on my spouse,’ then we coded it as disloyalty. But it could have been coded as dishonesty as well."" Ultimately, he explains, the research team opted to be consistent in their coding and to stick to the foundations’ definitions. Immoral acts vary more widely than moral ones And the results they’ve obtained so far are pretty revealing. For one thing, they found that the moral acts that people described tended to be based on caring, whereas immoral acts were more diverse and centered around harm, unfairness and dishonesty. The researchers also found that regardless of religious or nonreligious affiliation, participants responded positively to the survey and described a morally relevant situation about 29 percent of the time. ""The main finding is that morally relevant phenomena happens fairly often,"" Wisneski says. ""And being religious, or nonreligious, doesn’t change that frequency."" Moreover, the study was able to confirm what previous lab studies have found: that being the target of a morally positive act makes people more likely to commit one themselves, whereas committing a moral act subsequently gives people the license to do something morally reprehensible — a phenomenon called ""moral self-licensing."" ""The fact that these data bear out this effect is in everyday life is very interesting,"" says David Pizarro, a psychologist at Cornell University who didn't participate in the study. ""It seems as if good moral deeds spread across people more than within people."" Still, Pizarro is skeptical of the self-reporting aspect of the experiment. ""Some of the main findings might not be due to the actual frequency of these acts in the real world, but simply to the fact that people are likely to report some acts instead of others."" ""religious affiliation didn’t predict morally positive actions."" Wisneski says that this type of criticism is perfectly valid, but counters it by stating that there was no real incentive to present oneself in a favorable light. For example, some people readily admitted to infidelity during the three-day period. Moreover, he says, ""some might say that by doing this study, we’re bringing [morality] to mind a lot,"" and therefore priming people to think of their life in moral terms more than they normally would. But in reality, the participants were ""incentivized to under-report moral acts"" because answering the survey negatively didn't take as long, and they were still entered in the contest. Thus, Wisneski thinks that it’s likely that the results are pretty representative of what humans of a certain economic status — humans who own smartphones, as was required of the study’s participants — experience on a regular basis. ""This is a novel, thoughtful and informative study,"" says Fiery Cushman, a psychologist at Harvard University. ""The findings mostly corroborate theories that emerged from laboratory-based research, but there are a few surprises,"" like the fact that religious affiliation didn’t predict morally positive actions. No word on whether smartphone preference is linked to morality  The researchers now plan to take an even deeper look into the huge data sets they've gathered. They'd like to look at other factors that might come into play in everyday life, such as socio-economic status. And other, quirkier questions might also be worth investigating, says lead author and University of Cologne psychologist Wilhelm Hofmann. We ""did not look at correlates between smartphone [platforms] and demographics or predictors of moral experiences,"" he wrote in an email to The Verge, but that would ""definitely be something to consider in future analyses."" For now, however, we have to live without knowing if Windows phone users commit more moral acts than iPhone users.",0.6380705838328173,0.36192941616718266,0.1730655769388608,1004,5.2111553784860556,524,6.5,0,0,"Science, Report",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Facts can get distorted and events become increasingly fictional. But thanks to a discovery announced today by Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, the reliability of one specific Inuit tale is now indisputable. Because, as it turns out, Inuit lore accurately predicted the location of a shipwreck belonging to British Arctic explorer Sir John Franklin. ""white men who were starving."" Franklin perished sometime between 1845 and 1850 along with the rest of his 128-person crew after his two ships got stuck in ice. He was trying to map the Northwest passage when the expedition went awry. And although the Inuit have been telling stories for over 150 years of ""white men who were starving"" in the late 1850s in the very area where the shipwreck was found, it wasn't until Saturday that the tale was confirmed. ""The beauty of where [the researchers] found it is it's proof positive of Inuit oral history,"" said CBC chief correspondent Peter Mansbridge during a live broadcast today. Mansbridge, a reporter who has covered the Franklin search for a number of years, was clearly impressed by the the tale’s accuracy. ""The Inuit have said for generations that one of their hunters saw a ship in that part of the passage, abandoned and ended up wrecking… It's exactly where this guy said it was."" The researchers say that they're certain that the ship belongs to Franklin, reports the CBC. Unfortunately, they were unable to confirm exactly which of his ships they found. It could be the HMS Erebus or the HMS Terror, so the scientists will soon begin exploring its contents for clues about the vessel's identify. Regardless, Harper said, the discovery is a ""historic event"" for Canada. ""For more than a century, [Franklin’s journey] has been a great Canadian story,"" he said. This is ""a really important day in mapping together the history of our country."" ""It's proof positive of Inuit oral history."" A remotely-operated underwater vehicle is responsible for finding the shipwreck, which was located at the bottom of the Victoria Strait, near King William Island in Nunavut, a northern Canadian territory.

It was Spinosaurus aegyptiacus, a 50-foot long creature with powerful jaws and a solid, spiny sail on its back that dwelled in Northern Africa 95 million years ago. But even though paleontologists have known about this particular dinosaur for almost a century, its true form has only just been revealed. ""The only dinosaur that shows [aquatic] adaptations."" This is ""the first water-adapted non-avian dinosaur on record,"" said University of Chicago paleontologist Paul Sereno in a press conference yesterday. Sereno is part of a team of researchers that was finally able to reconstruct Spinosaurus in full using newly discovered fossils and information gathered from the dinosaur’s initial discoverer, a German paleontologist named Ernst Stromer. According to their reconstruction, published today in Science, Spinosaurus aegyptiacus was a gigantic fish-eating, water-paddling marvel; one that, in Sereno’s words, was ""a chimera — half duck, half crocodile."" ""Spinosaurus is the only dinosaur that shows [aquatic] adaptations,"" said Nizar Ibrahim, a study co-author and paleontologist also at the University of Chicago. These include ""a nose opening far back on the skull"" which allowed the animal to breathe when its head is partially submerged, he said, as well as cone shaped teeth and slender jaw that would have allowed it to catch aquatic prey. The dinosaur’s hip and leg bones were also reduced compared to other Spinosaurus species. ""This is something we’ve seen animals that return to the sea such as the ancestors of modern whales,"" Ibrahim said. ""it is going to force dinosaur experts to rethink many things they thought they knew about dinosaurs."" Moreover, its bones were very dense and compact — an adaptation that the researchers think was meant to help it with buoyancy control in water. ""The animal we are resurrecting is so bizarre,"" Ibrahim said, that ""it is going to force dinosaur experts to rethink many things they thought they knew about dinosaurs."" Yet, despite Ibrahim's claim, Spinosaurus’ oddly shaped body isn’t the only surprising aspect of the discovery. Arguably, the events that allowed the researchers to come to these conclusions are just as captivating.   Credit: Tyler Keillor, Lauren Conroy, and Erin Fitzgerald, Ibrahim et al., Science/AAAS ""Spinosaurus were first named by German paleontologist, Ernst Stromer"" in 1915, Ibrahim explained. Back then, Stromer described several bizarre backbones with spines — ""some as tall as a person,"" Ibrahim said, and slender jawbones. Based on that finding alone, Stromer was able to deduce that he was likely dealing with a fish-eating dinosaur that was larger than the 40-foot long North American Tyrannosaurus rex. He didn’t possess enough information to guess at its aquatic lifestyle, however. And sadly, the bones he collected were lost in 1944, when a Royal Air Force raid destroyed the Bavarian State bone collection in Munich. Although some of Stromer’s descriptions and drawings were recovered, Ibrahim said, ""Spinosaurus was seemingly lost forever."" ""Spinosaurus was seemingly lost forever."" Yet, by chance, Ibrahim met an amateur fossil collector in Morocco in April 2008 while conducting research for his PhD. ""He had a cardboard box and inside were several bones,"" he said. ""They were mostly covered in sediment [...], but one bone really caught my attention."" It wasn’t until much later that the researcher found out what is was: the spine of a Spinosaurus. ""We made sure that [the bones] were deposited in the university collection at Casablanca where all our finds are curated,"" he said, ""and I thought maybe one day I’ll figure out what these bones are."" Eventually, Ibrahim’s Italian colleagues, Cristiano Dal Sasso and Simone Magsanuco, told him the truth. ""But we had one big problem; my Italian colleagues didn’t know where exactly the skeleton came from, you know?"" And so, Ibrahim and his colleagues set out to track down the amateur fossil hunter that had given them the spine. Ibrahim knew nothing about him, except that he sported a mustache. Still in 2013, they found him. ""We were just sitting at a café in Erfoud sipping mint tea and I just saw all of my dreams going down the drain,"" Ibrahim said. And in that very moment, the researcher spotted him, the mustachioed man, walking past his table in the café. ""I just caught the glimpse of his face, but I immediately recognized it."" ""We found 'our needle in the Sahara.'"" The man remembered Ibrahim, and agreed to take the researchers to the site in Morocco where he had found the spine. There, the paleontologists found vertebrae, teeth, and jaw pieces belonging to Spinosaurus. ""We found our 'needle in the Sahara.' And so that’s when we started the real scientific work."" Over the course of the next year, the researchers worked tirelessly to compile information from Stromer’s sketches, records from various other museums, and the fossils they collected in Morocco, in a single 3D model of the gigantic, semi-aquatic Spinosaurus. ""We didn’t overturn a single thing [Stromer] said — an astounding fact considering that he just had the material that he collected from the early part of the century,"" Sereno said. ""It’s really a tribute to [Stromer’s] excellent work and, in fact, his excellent interpretations."" Now that the researchers have the skeleton in place, they hope to use the 3D models they generated to study how it might have moved on land, as well as in water. Chances are that it wasn’t all that graceful on land, Sereno said. ""I think that we have to face the fact that the Jurassic Park folks have to go back to the drawing board on Spinosaurus."" Given its proportions, it likely wasn’t a two-legged animal on land that deftly wielded its arms. Still, he said, ""it would’ve been a fearsome animal. There is no question about it. You would not want to meet this animal.""",0.2801651024747358,0.7198348975252642,0.8557276055051594,976,5.1915983606557381,513,6.2280701754385968,0,2,"Science, Report",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

According to BuzzFeed, Twitter is now in the process of making its real-time news feed accessible to everyone, whether they're on desktop, mobile, or even signed into Twitter to begin with. ""A brand new way to look at tweets."" The new product is called Project Lightning, and Twitter's Kevin Weil tells BuzzFeed's Mat Honan that ""it's a brand new way to look at tweets."" That's because Twitter is taking a decidedly editorial approach to news curation, complete with a team of people with newsroom backgrounds who will identify the best tweets for anyone online trying to follow a news story. That means users won't need to rely on blogs to suss out meaning from the events Twitter thrives on. They can go right to the source. This direction and experience is bold and uniquely Twitter!

On mobile at least, the new product will live in Twitter's home row, and show collections about current events and breaking news. Each collection will be updated in real time and load instantly. They'll also take over the device's entire screen, all the better for showing off photos, video, Vines, and Periscopes. Crucially, the new functionality will work whether the user is an active user or not. The collections themselves can be embedded online and in other apps. The endgame is for Twitter to attract more users by being that much more visible, which is important if the company wants to grow its userbase.

The article, by Glenn Greenwald, prompted The Sunday Times to ""quietly remove"" major claims in their own story, such as the claim that Greenwald’s life partner David Miranda had met with Snowden in Moscow prior to being detained in Heathrow. The target of the takedown notice was an embedded image of the Sunday Times front page, which the Sunday Times tweeted on June 13th. Greenwald has stated that he does not intend to comply with the DMCA notice, and it’s likely invalid, according to Corynne McSherry, legal director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, who calls the notice ""ridiculous."" McSherry pointed out that the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) doesn’t even apply here because the notice-and-takedown procedure is for ""intermediaries""—sites like YouTube, Facebook, or Twitter that host content at the direction of their users. No, @TheSundayTimes, we are not going to remove the image of your humiliating headline from our story about it https://t.co/55sCL5irnT  While The Sunday Times has already received some ridicule for sending out an invalid notice in what appears to be an ill-advised attempt to squelch criticism, it may face little to no legal repercussions. That’s something that the EFF has been fighting for years to change, by arguing for a stronger interpretation of 17 U.S.C. 512(f), which bars ""knowing material misrepresentation"" of DMCA notices. An important court date awaits them on July 7th, when the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals will hear Lenz v. Universal — more popularly known as the ""dancing baby case."" Section 512(f) is the only counterbalance written into the DMCA meant to curb misuse of the law. The question in Lenz is whether the provision can be invoked when someone tries to take something down without considering whether it’s covered under fair use. In 2007, Stephanie Lenz, the mother of two young children, posted a 30-second clip on YouTube featuring 18-month-old Holden Lenz pushing a toy stroller and jiggling excitedly while the radio plays in the background. The sound quality is poor, and the music is nearly indistinct, but Prince fans will recognize the song ""Let’s Go Crazy.""  Universal Music Group issued a DMCA notice, and YouTube took it down. Weeks passed. Stephanie Lenz was angry. The EFF came to her aid after one of their attorneys helped her file a counter-notice; the video was restored. But then the EFF then took it a step further. A DMCA takedown for less than 30 seconds of fuzzy background audio was nonsense, especially coming from a well-monied and well-lawyered corporation like Universal. Universal had abused the DMCA, and under 512(f), they ought to pay. It seems simple enough, but things didn’t pan out exactly as the EFF had hoped. The lawsuit started eight years ago and is still ongoing. In January 2013, the judge denied motions for summary judgment, meaning that the EFF and Universal would have to go to trial. His opinion in Lenz may have rendered 512(f) into a toothless law. In the judge’s words, Lenz had to show ""Universal had some actual knowledge that its takedown notice contained a material misrepresentation."" It wasn’t enough that Universal had claimed that Lenz was violating copyright, even while failing to consider if it had been a fair use. Lenz was supposed to show something more. And on top of that, the judge ruled that even if Lenz ended up winning at trial, she was entitled to, at most, $1,275 for the 4.25 hours that an EFF attorney spent filing a counter-notice. She wasn’t entitled to damages for ""loss of YouTube’s hosting services and chilling of her free speech"" or ""lost time and resources,"" or even attorneys’ fees for the entire lawsuit in the first place. In other words, plaintiffs like Lenz would have to pay huge amounts of legal fees in order to be able to recoup smaller amounts of legal fees incurred from fighting abusive DMCA notices. Commentators like Eric Goldman, professor at Santa Clara University School of Law, were declaring that ""17 U.S.C. 512(f) is Dead."" ""The judge's opinion may have rendered 512(f) a toothless law."" The EFF appealed the decision to the Ninth Circuit, which will finally hear arguments in the case next month. ""I think 512(f) has been misinterpreted and that’s why the Lenz case is so important,"" said McSherry. ""This is an opportunity for the Ninth Circuit to set the record straight. If you go to the statutes, it’s really pretty straightforward."" The EFF is hoping the Ninth Circuit will make it clear that ""before you send a takedown notice under the DMCA, you have to consider whether the use in question is authorized by law. Not just authorized by the owner but authorized by law."" And on top of that, plaintiffs like Lenz should be entitled to any damages. ""That’s what Congress said: any damages. That means any and all damages, including attorneys’ fees and costs."" DMCA abuse is fairly common DMCA abuse, as The Intercept has learned, is fairly common. For example, both Twitter and Wordpress estimate that approximately one-third of DMCA notices sent to them are not worthy of compliance. But cases about DMCA abuse are rare. Lenz is important because it’s one of the few cases out there about 512(f). To date, only two plaintiffs have ever won 512(f) cases. One case was Online Policy Group v. Diebold (2005), where the voting machine manufacturer attempted to take down information about security flaws in its machines. The other, Automattic v. Steiner, was decided just this March. In Automattic, blogging platform Wordpress was hit with a DMCA notice by homophobic organization ""Straight Pride UK,"" over a blog that had published an unflattering press statement that Straight Pride UK had written themselves. As the case played out, Straight Pride UK vanished into thin air, and Wordpress ended up winning the suit — possibly, as Eric Goldman asserts, because Straight Pride UK defaulted by disappearing. If the Ninth Circuit reverses Lenz, 512(f) could finally live up to its potential. ""We have 10 years of takedown abuse to show that this is actually a real problem. The statute needs to be interpreted correctly so it can actually help users in situations like [The Intercept’s], situations where you’ve got someone reaching for the DMCA as a tool, not because there’s any legitimate infringement, but because they want to shut someone up,"" said McSherry. Media organizations have used the DMCA to get back at each other for criticism The Sunday Times’ defective DMCA notice could set off the Streisand Effect, at most, and will probably go no farther. But DMCA abuse in the media will continue. McSherry predicts that it will run rampant in the coming campaign season. In the past, media organizations from opposite ends of the political spectrum have used the DMCA to get back at each other for criticism — for example, in 2012 right-wing pundit Rush Limbaugh used the DMCA to take down a 7-minute compilation of ""Rush Limbaugh’s most vile smears"" against Sandra Fluke, uploaded to YouTube by left-wing publication Daily Kos. ""Of all organizations, they should know better than to abuse the DMCA in this way,"" said McSherry. ""They should be defenders of free speech, they should be defenders of fair use because they rely on it themselves."" And although a publication can just shrug off a defective DMCA notice, the growing trend in digital journalism is a reliance on third-party platforms like Facebook, which are indeed the intermediaries that the DMCA actually applies to. See, for example, Facebook’s Instant Articles, where stories from outlets like The New York Times and BuzzFeed are hosted on Facebook’s servers. What will happen when Facebook gets hit with DMCA notices intended to censor those articles? With 512(f) in its current state, there are few incentives for third-party platforms to stick up for their users in the face of even a defective notice. What happens with DMCA abuse, censorship, and digital journalism in the next few years may really all depend on how that dancing baby case plays out.",0.5151484668258909,0.4848515331741091,0.8471643181427432,1372,5.0597667638483967,670,6.3776119402985074,0,0,"Culture, Tech, Report",0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Video streams on the newly-launched YouTube Newswire channel cover stories such as the Charleston church shooting (a playlist which includes footage from local newspaper The State Newspaper), and floods in Texas and Oklahoma (which is almost entirely comprised of user-generated footage of rising water and storms). The service will cover both global and regional news, says YouTube, with a Twitter feed and a daily newsletter announcing the latest and best videos.

The service is launching in partnership with social news agency Storyful, whose team of journalists will work to verify footage. Storyful has worked with YouTube in the past as well as companies like Facebook, and even helped to launch the social network's own news service, FB Newswire, last year. Storyful's blog shows the company's ability to identify hoax videos — for example, calling out Jimmy Kimmel's ""Worst Twerk Fail EVER"" video as a set-up four days before the TV host revealed it was fake. Storyful's team came to their conclusion after spotting a number of contextual clues within the footage, as well as noting that the video was not being monetized — unusual for a viral hit. YouTube believes that journalists should also be able to spot such hoaxes, and alongside YouTube Newswire, the company is also launching The First Draft Coalition: an forthcoming educational resource created by experts such as Bellingcat (a site founded by Eliot Higgins, a British citizen journalist) which will teach people how to verify eyewitness footage.

The fiber would have to be laid in a maze of underground tunnels and ducts, maintained by a Verizon subsidiary called Empire City Subway (or ECS). Until ECS cleans up the mess of tunnels under the city, laying more fiber is effectively impossible — and by all indications, the company is in no hurry. Part of the problem is simple cost: it's expensive to clear out the tunnels, and it's unclear how much return ECS would see on their investment. But Verizon also has an incentive to keep the underground tunnels messy. As long as there's no room for more fiber, the company will be the only game in town.

The companies have filed a request for review with the Federal Communications Commission, one of the agencies that will have to approve the $45 billion deal between America's two largest providers of wired broadband. In a 181-page document, the companies argued that Comcast's acquisition of TWC would give consumers network upgrades, better cable TV services, and expanded broadband access for low-income users. It's also seeking to allay fears that a merger would reduce competition in the already highly consolidated home broadband market. Many of the promised benefits apparently stem from Comcast expanding its existing services to cover TWC customers. Its video service Xfinity On Demand will come to TWC markets, as will Comcast's subsidized ""Internet Essentials"" program for low-income Americans; the companies will pool their resources for Wi-Fi hotspots, with Comcast offering TWC subscribers access to its far bigger network. While a court eviscerated the FCC's net neutrality rules in February, Comcast is still required to abide by them until 2018 as part of a previous agreement, and the merger will require TWC to do the same.  But the biggest issue for regulators will likely be the size of the two companies and the generally uncompetitive wired broadband market: Comcast and TWC put together would have around 30 million TV and internet customers to their name, an order of magnitude larger than a company like Cablevision. Their gambit, essentially, is to ignore the entire broadband market and position themselves against all other internet-related companies. The chart above cites the market cap of Microsoft, Apple, Google, and Facebook, along with the largest wireless carriers: Verizon and AT&T. ""The traditional boundaries between media, communications, and technology are obsolete,"" it says. It's even compared its service to the minuscule Google Fiber. This argument will have to convince both the FCC and the Department of Justice, which Comcast and TWC filed a notification with last week.

The merger, announced in February, would let Comcast take over markets that include, among other places, parts of New York, Texas, and Southern California. This would give Comcast a stranglehold on the US broadband market, but it’s not a sure thing yet. The Department of Justice and FCC must decide whether the merger poses a threat to competition for internet and cable services, and the Senate Judiciary Committee is questioning executives in a hearing today.  Comcast and Time Warner Cable markets. (Comcast)     Both companies have been vocal about the supposed benefits of a takeover. Since they operate in different markets, Comcast and TWC argue that they aren’t directly competing for customers, saying that consumers have plenty of other options for internet and video services. We’ve taken a look at the 181 pages of redacted facts, dubious comparisons, and reassuring promises that they’re using to back up their case. There is absolutely no way that Comcast can argue it would have meaningful competition in wired broadband or cable after the merger. It’s impossible. Comcast was estimated to have about 20.7 million broadband subscribers and 21.7 million video subscribers at the end of 2013; Time Warner Cable counted about 11 million for both categories. AT&T counted 10.4 million U-Verse internet subscribers and 5.5 million TV subscribers, bringing it close to pre-merger TWC, at least in broadband. Verizon, however, counted only about 6 million FiOS internet and 5 million FiOS video customers in its earnings statement. CenturyLink reported 6 million broadband subscribers, and Charter counted 4.3 million ""internet"" customers and 4.2 ""video"" ones. A merger would turn Comcast’s already long lead into overwhelming dominance. And Comcast knows this. There is absolutely no way that Comcast can argue it would have meaningful competition in wired broadband or cable after the merger So how can it convince the FCC that this isn’t a problem? By comparing itself to pretty much any company that offers internet or video service in any form. Leaving aside its link to NBCUniversal, Comcast has three major offerings: wired broadband, cable TV, and video on demand. If a company has moved into any of those spaces, Comcast says it’s a competitor. Taken individually, each of these companies do compete in some sense with parts of Comcast, but the comparison falls apart when you look at how many of these services run on its broadband network. Comcast offers carefully constructed revenue and market cap charts that place it and TWC at the very bottom of the scale — except that it’s comparing itself to the entirety of multinational giants like Apple, AT&T, and Microsoft, as well as bizarre additions like Facebook. There’s even an offhand reference to how Comcast ""vigorously competes"" with Twitter for engineering talent.  Market caps of companies in Comcast's ""competitive ecosystem."" (Comcast)     Comcast can only claim new services compete with existing wired broadband if it vastly oversells their potential. Google announced tentative plans to bring Fiber to more cities in February, and Comcast has spun this into a pending flurry of expansions, ignoring the fact that Google has until the end of 2014 to announce its decision and currently operates in only two small markets. There’s no doubt it can spur competition, but certainly not on the scale that Comcast implies. According to Comcast, you can have choices for broadband as long as you don’t really like using the internet very much The same goes for wireless broadband from AT&T and Verizon. 4G LTE can certainly provide speeds ""comparable to many of the wired broadband services consumers purchase"" in the right areas, but it’s far from equivalent. Verizon promises average speeds of 5 to 12Mbps downstream on its LTE broadband router, close to Comcast’s second-slowest tier and a far cry from its ""Extreme"" 150Mbps plan. And Comcast is counting heavily on the assumption that data caps will lift, citing expert testimony that ""while pricing for wireless broadband plans with substantial data usage is higher than for other broadband services today, these prices have and will continue to come down over time as wireless providers achieve more capacity."" Under Verizon’s latest plans, $40 a month can buy you 4GB of LTE for a tablet. For comparison, a Comcast Xfinity plan is capped at no less than 300GB, and Netflix estimates that streaming standard-definition video uses 1GB per hour. That’s a big gap for wireless providers to bridge, given that wired internet is virtually a basic utility at this point. According to Comcast, you can have choices for broadband as long as you don’t really like using the internet very much.   Other broadband operators in major markets. (Comcast)     Comcast also points to the existence of other wired internet carriers, which it lays out in a chart of every ISP operating in 20 metropolitan areas. They are all, of course, miniscule compared to Comcast or Time Warner Cable. But this isn’t an unusual tactic: AT&T and T-Mobile offered similar comparisons when proposing their failed 2011 merger, describing tiny companies as fearsome competitors. Comcast’s coup de grace, though, is the fact that it doesn’t share any current markets with Time Warner Cable. In a purely technical sense, you’ll never have to pick between them for service. Therefore, Comcast says, they aren’t actually competitors at all, absolving them of any antitrust complaints. But the FCC will have to decide whether this lack of direct geographical competition and the potential benefits for consumers outweigh the threat of letting one company own an overwhelming amount of the overall market. Comcast needs to sell the FCC on the potential improvements a merger would bring, but it thinks that its cable and broadband networks are already pretty great. The solution to this quandary is telling Time Warner Cable customers how much better their service will get. According to the filing, TWC will reap the rewards of Comcast’s hard work and get support to carry out planned upgrades, while both companies benefit from increased efficiency. The takeaway here is that if you’re in a Time Warner Cable market, there’s a good chance you’ll get more speed for your money: right now, a 25Mbps connection from Comcast costs about $5 less than a 20Mbps one from TWC. But TWC was already planning to speed up its service in at least two markets — its plan would give ""Standard"" subscribers a full 50Mbps down. The other returns are debatable. Comcast itself points out that cable companies have already pooled resources for a joint Wi-Fi network, and it’s hard to estimate how much Comcast will expedite TWC’s network overhauls. As for its purported customer-service improvements, upgrading to Comcast quality isn’t really much of a step up. As part of just about any merger, the FCC and Department of Justice will set conditions for companies to follow. Comcast agreed to a number of these when it merged with NBCUniversal in 2011, and it’s offering to carry some of them over to its newest deal. If the TWC takeover is approved, it will almost certainly come with rules — it’s just not clear how meaningful they’ll be. Comcast’s latest Internet Essentials report said that 300,000 families had signed up since its inception, and this would make it potentially available to millions more, though far fewer would meet the requirements. Though TWC offers a slower $15 internet service tier, its own low-income $9.95 ""Starter Internet"" pilot program ended in January 2013. A merger will almost certainly come with rules — it’s just not clear how meaningful they’ll be The proposed net neutrality expansion is billed as a major benefit to consumers, and it certainly provides a stopgap while FCC chair Tom Wheeler tries to figure out a way forward for his Open Internet plans. These rules, however, didn’t prevent Comcast from striking a deal with Netflix for better service, or stop it from exempting its Xfinity Xbox app from data caps. Comcast and TWC are giving the FCC some facts that we’re not privy to in the redacted version, which could give a better picture of their current capabilities. We’re told, for example, that one-third of Comcast customers are on speed tiers that offer 50Mbps downstream or higher, but the companies obscure what percent of customers meet the minimum broadband standard of 3Mbps, and how many occupy the middle tier of around 25Mbps. By and large, though, these facts are beside the point, as are the promised upgrades. This is an argument based on loosely interpreted ideas about the nature of ""competition,"" and Comcast is stretching these ideas as far as they’ll go. As Comcast executive VP David Cohen writes, it’s pushing for a definition in which ""traditional boundaries between media, communications, and technology are obsolete.""

In its motion, the EFF argues that the NSA's program violates the Fourth Amendment by indiscriminately searching and copying web traffic collected from internet cables and nodes. The motion, Jewel v. NSA, was filed in 2008 after a former AT&T employee revealed that the NSA was routing copied internet traffic to a secret room in San Francisco. The case has since been bolstered by the massive trove of documents leaked by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden. ""The eyes and ears of the government now sit on the internet.""

Today, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said the city has signed a contract to buy 800 Axon cameras made by Taser that will make their way into the field now, with an additional 6,200 that are being worked into next year's city budget. The city's police commission raised $1.5 million to buy that first batch, which Garcetti says will be used first in areas of the city that have ""high police activity.""  ""Out on the street, things aren't always clear cut."" ""Out on the street, things aren't always clear cut,"" Garcetti said in a statement. ""These cameras will help law enforcement and the public alike find the truth — and truth is essential to the trust between the LAPD and the community, which has been a key factor in lowering crime to record lows.""  The move shouldn't be a total surprise. As The Los Angeles Times notes, the LAPD began a three-month-long pilot program earlier this year to test cameras made by multiple manufacturers, with the intent to buy some 600 of the cameras once a model was chosen. The original plan called for officers to swap cameras with one another between shifts, whereas a larger pool of devices reduces the need for that. Once viewed as a walking civil rights violation, body cameras have come to be viewed by many as an effective way of recording interactions between law enforcement and citizens. That's despite the recent deaths of Eric Garner and Tamir Rice, separate incidents involving police that were caught on tape, yet resulted in no indictments for the officers involved. Yet the question remains of whether the technology might have resulted in a clearer version of what happened in the fatal shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, about which witnesses have wildly varying opinions. Los Angeles, New York, and Ferguson are not the only cities with police camera programs. Cities across the country are slated to get them as part of a $263 million federal funding plan that was announced at the beginning of this month, and that will distribute some 50,000 cameras to various departments. That's just a tiny portion of the more than 750,000 police officers across the country, though local departments could raise funding to buy the cameras outside of federal programs, just like what's happening in Los Angeles.",0.49930549124285495,0.500694508757145,0.8511638786857939,427,4.8501170960187352,253,5.6719367588932803,0,0,"Tech, US & World",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night, the next game from longtime Castlevania producer Koji Igarashi, has just become the most funded video game on Kickstarter. It surpassed RPG Torment: Tides of Numenera, which raised more than $4.1 million in April 2013. Bloodstained first launched on Kickstarter last month, and managed to raise more than $1 million in less than 24 hours. And while it doesn't have the Castlevania name attached to it, the game looks very reminiscent of Igarashi's past work, which includes classics like Symphony of the Night. Just like those games, Bloodstained is a 2D action-adventure game with a heavy emphasis on exploration. The game takes place in a sprawling castle, and stars a new character named Miriam, described as ""an orphan scarred by an alchemist curse which slowly crystallizes [her] skin."" Naturally, the cure is fighting lots of demons.   The success of Bloodstained shouldn't be too surprising; Igarashi is just the latest in a long line of notable developers using crowdfunding to reimagine the games that made them famous. Mega Man mastermind Keiji Inafune, for instance, left Capcom to develop a very Mega Man-like game called Mighty No. 9. It raised more than $3.8 million on Kickstarter and is due to release in September. (Capcom, meanwhile, is using a different tactic to honor the Blue Bomber's legacy.) Mighty No. 9 is being co-developed by Japanese studio Inti Creates, who also happen to be working on Bloodstained. While the new milestone makes Igarashi's new title the biggest video game on Kickstarter, it's not quite the biggest in the games category overall. That title goes to Exploding Kittens, a card game from The Oatmeal, which raised $8.7 million back in February.

Motherhood and what it means has weighed heavily on the inmates of Litchfield over the past two seasons, and now it’s used both to reintroduce the characters we’ve come to love and remind us of the inherent tragedy in their incarceration. Dayanara (Dascha Polanco) is struggling with the crushing reality of having a baby with a prison guard. Black Cindy (Adrienne C. Moore) hates children, unable to deal with the fact that she herself is a mother.   But it takes 11 minutes for us to finally make our way to Piper Chapman (Taylor Schilling), still the show’s top-billed character, and as she talks with a guard about her future, she seems cut off from problems plaguing prisoners we’ve been conditioned to care more about. It’s clearer than ever that Piper, the overeducated Connecticut WASP who started as our lens into this world, is fading into the background. Showrunner Jenji Kohan is as deft as ever at balancing the stories of her sprawling cast of female prisoners with a hilariously offbeat but nevertheless biting indictment of the prison industrial complex. But for two years, Piper’s story has been the least interesting arc of the series. Whether intentionally or incidentally, the show just isn’t about her anymore. Piper’s continued presence makes sense because her story is an intrinsic fact of the narrative. (Her character is a fictionalized version of Piper Kerman, whose memoir, Orange Is the New Black: My Year In a Women’s Prison, the show moves further away from with each season.) In the first two seasons, we saw prison life through her terrified eyes and watched as her relationship with her lump of a fiancé Larry Bloom (Jason Biggs), slowly crumbled. Now, she maintains a destructive relationship with her ex, Alex Vause (Laura Prepon), in a solid B-level plot that also, conveniently, keeps her in jail. The other prisoners in Piper’s life have since stolen the show. A lot of that development happened in season two, as Orange took more time to examine the other characters and their relationships, and give some insight into how they became criminals. That growth isn’t slowing down at all this season. Uzo Aduba’s emotionally disturbed Suzanne ""Crazy Eyes"" Warren, for instance, has gone from Piper’s unwanted love interest to a singular character of her own, coping with the loss of a mother figure and now trying to tamp down her crazy as part of the Black inmate clique. Meanwhile, Kate Mulgrew’s Red is still making power plays, but after losing her kitchen empire in season one, she finally makes her way back to her throne this season. Kohan deserves all the credit in the world for writing such varied, tragicomic characters, and for keeping them dynamic even as she elevates her critique of the American prison system in season three. This season brings with it bed bugs, book burnings, and a badly underfunded Litchfield on the brink of being closed. To save the facility, the prison administrators have to turn to an outside contracting company to save people’s jobs, but the deal is more complicated and exploitative than anyone ever expected. As a consequence of the new regime, we’re introduced to even more characters and even more back stories, more threads vying for our investment. Somehow. Even when I felt like I shouldn’t be so interested in the plight of the militantly butch Big Boo (Lea DeLaria) or Chang’s (Lori Tan Chinn) gangland past, I was pulled right in. But with all these new developments, we still somehow have time for Piper — fueled mostly by Alex’s return to prison. Alex testified against her former drug lord employer last season, and she’s now paranoid an assassin will take her out. It’s a valid fear, and it injects her scenes with Piper with a sense of dread. Still, their reunion feels like just another story in the grander Litchfield saga, making their hookup sessions R-rated commercial breaks distracting from the real action happening in the prison. Piper and Alex’s arc stands alone now, and though there’s nothing wrong with that — it’s just not as compelling as everyone else’s. If I had my druthers, I’d have Piper written out altogether. The show left her behind years ago in favor of more interesting prisoners with stories that feel more vital. Even if she still has a long sentence ahead of her, there isn’t much stopping the writers from wrapping up her story by shunting her off to another facility or having her escape and going on the lam with Alex. Jenji Kohan is already known for pulling off crazy ideas. Unfortunately, we’re stuck with her for now. Which is a shame. Orange Is the New Black would be just fine without her.

As struggling bands so often do, Rovio has travelled abroad for creative inspiration, teaming up with Japanese company Kiteretsu Inc. to create Angry Birds Fight. The 11th game in the Angry Birds series, it's a title that mashes together elements of Candy Crush and RPG gaming in an attempt to hook players. 3 million downloads in the Asia Pacific region to date Angry Birds Fight soft-launched several months ago, with a release in the Asia Pacific region back in May clocking up 3 million downloads to date. Now, it's available worldwide on both Android and iOS, delivering the same colorful graphics and cast of characters as previous titles (if you don't know anything about Angry Birds lore let's just say it runs surprisingly deep).  Two screenshots from Angry Birds Fight shows the main game screen and world navigation screen. The basic gameplay mechanic of Angry Birds Fight is a match-three puzzler that lets you power up your avatar to defeat either computer or human opponents. There's also an RPG-style leveling system layered over the top, letting players buy gear and weapons to boost their characters' health and attack stats before battles. There's no actual control over the fighting (players are just trying to match tiles on the board to increase their chance of winning) but in essence, Rovio has simply combined some of the most addictive gameplay mechanics available in an attempt to create a new monster hit.

The mobile puzzle game has been downloaded more than a million times, and even spawned a console version on Xbox One. But despite the sales and accolades, the developers behind it feel that it hasn’t really met its full potential. A lot of that has to do with the $2.99 price tag, and the strange debacle it unintentionally inspired. So today they’re making Threes free. ""Keeping such an accessible game behind a paywall has always felt like a misstep,"" says Threes designer Asher Vollmer. The free version of the game has been in the works for around a year, and in that time the creators have been figuring out how to make the game free without ruining its appeal. There are no in-app purchases in the new version, or pop-up ads of any kind. Instead, in order to play you can earn credits by watching ads, and then spend them on rounds of Threes, sort of like an arcade machine. If the ads bug you, you can just pay the normal price to get rid of them. ""2048 has mostly served as a constant, overwhelming reminder of our mistake."" One of the key sticking points, says Vollmer, was figuring out a way to make the game free, without inviting players to game the system and figure out ways to get more for nothing. ""When I play a traditional free-to-play game, my instinct is ‘how much of this game can I play without spending a cent?’ and I know I'm not the only one who thinks this way,"" he explains. ""This mentality is super toxic on both ends: the average player wants to avoid supporting the developer and the developer learns to rely solely on whales,"" a reference to the small percentage of players who make up the vast majority of purchases in free games. One of the reasons Vollmer and artist Greg Wohlwend know that a free version of Threes could be successful is because it’s already happened. After Threes was released, the game was cloned many times, and copycat games like 2048 managed to reach a much larger audience largely because they were free. ""2048 has mostly served as a constant, overwhelming reminder of our mistake,"" says Vollmer. ""It taught us about the massive size of our potential audience."" Wohlwend adds that ""Threes is the original, the best, and the game that will stick. We're confident of that now and waiting to find the right solution for how to bring Threes to a wider audience is a result of that confidence."" Several games have similarly attempted to use a less exploitative form of monetization, though few have managed to see much success from it. Punch Quest infamously switched to a paid release after the free version proved to be a financial failure. But Vollmer believes the ad system they’ve created for Threes should help get around some of the typical pitfalls these games face. ""I feel like the games that have tried — and failed — to do ethical free-to-play games in the past have all made a pretty critical mistake: they gave too much away for free,"" he explains. ""Our model doesn't let you play very long without directly supporting us. You have to watch an ad to keep playing."" The system was inspired by, of all things, Flappy Bird. ""Flappy Bird was a nice and simple ad-supported game,"" says Wohlwend. ""It felt honest and I think that's part of its success."" ""Our model doesn't let you play very long without directly supporting us."" Since the initial release of Threes last February, both Vollmer and Wohlwend have continued to work on the game and its many ports, while also moving on to new projects. Wohlwend partnered with designer Mike Boxleiter to create the surveillance-themed puzzle game Touchtone this past March. Vollmer, meanwhile, has struggled to come up with a new game following the success of Threes, but recently released a fun new experiment with the peasant simulator Royals. In addition to the new version of the game, today the pair are also announcing the release of some beautiful new Threes art prints that fans can buy. The hope is that the free release of Threes will not only help introduce the game to a new audience, but also help pay for the game’s continued existence; in addition to Wohlwend and Vollmer, Hidden Variable Studios is also still working on the game, primarily handling the Android version. But there’s also the fear that the free version will be so good that people will stop paying for Threes altogether. ""There's a chance that the free version will totally cannibalize our revenue and we will start earning zero dollars a day,"" says Vollmer. ""I will consider this launch a success if that does not happen."" The free version of Threes is available to download today on iOS and Android.",0.5957306467350757,0.4042693532649243,0.16118396262202758,824,4.7075242718446599,409,5.7970660146699267,0,2,"Culture, Entertainment, Gaming, Report",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Looking at my iPhone, I have five screens full of icons, or roughly 130 apps that I carry with me at all times. Several are junk apps that Apple preinstalls and won’t let me delete, but the other 100 or so are apps I purposely downloaded over the years. Usually out of want, rarely out of need. Some of these apps, like Slack and Trello are there for business purposes. Strictly speaking, in a hunter/gatherer kind of way, I can’t live without them because they help pay the bills. But I wouldn’t say they enhance my life in a Dalai Lama kind of way. Google Maps is definitely high on the list. It’s certainly made it easier getting from point A to B. But it’s not an app I use every day. Having given it some thought, I’d say that the one app I can’t live without is something called Buienradar — a Dutch weather app. I live in Amsterdam and the weather here is, quite frankly, shitty, and it changes without warning or logic almost hourly. Buienradar gives me reliable weather forecasts at 10 minute increments into the future, including alerts for severe weather. It’s like Dark Sky but ugly, and I’d quickly switch just as soon as its hyperlocal rain forecasts come to my town. Should I bring a jacket? Is it too windy to bicycle? Do I need an umbrella or a rain suit? These are the questions my weather app answers several times a day as I try to live my life in relative comfort. It’s the app that has to be in competing app stores should I ever switch platforms. It’s the one app I can’t live without. What’s yours?

Somebody built a methamphetamine lab inside a federal research facility, and a security guard was injured when it exploded. Chemical & Engineering News reports that the explosion took place July 18th at the National Institute of Standards & Technology, and local police say evidence at the scene is ""consistent with the production of"" meth. Congress is now investigating how this all happened, because they watched Breaking Bad and are not having it this close to our nation's capital. Motorola is expected to unveil its new line of phones this coming Tuesday, but tonight we got another look at one of them, apparently the new Moto X. According to the Android Peru's Facebook posts, it has received photos from a leaker of the new phone, which apparently has a 5.5-inch screen and a front-facing flash for well-illuminated selfies. There's also some strange talk of a fingerprint sensor somehow being integrated into the bottom speaker, which Android Peru couldn't confirm.

The finding, published in the Journal of Experimental Biology, likely means that many a biology textbook will need to be revised.

It's planning to give some small companies a pair of starter patents to help them out when it comes to getting off the ground and defending their intellectual property. Google doesn't appear to be making money off of the program, but it does have an end goal: as a condition of the program, companies receiving Google's patents will have to join a patent licensing network that's meant to help Silicon Valley defend against patent trolls — companies that sue over patent infringement without actually making any products. Google says that encouraging smaller companies to get on board with the program ""is just something that we think makes great sense.""  ""The bigger the network gets, the more protection the membership gets."" Google is calling this scheme, which appears to have been first spotted by TechCrunch, the Patent Starter Program. Only 50 startups or developers will be accepted into the program, and they have to meet certain requirements, including having a 2014 revenue between $500,000 and $20 million. If they're accepted, Google will identify three to five patent families that align with the participant's business, and the participant will be able to select two of them to keep. Participants will also be given access to a database of patents that Google has purchased from third parties, which they can use to find assets that it may be willing to sell. Most importantly, participating in the program requires joining the LOT Network for two years. The network was launched by tech companies including Google and Dropbox and is meant to help protect members against patent trolls. The group works by requiring that members give all other members a license to any patent that they decide to transfer to a party that isn't part of the network. That allows any company in the group to be immune to threats over those patents should they end up in the hands of a patent troll. The LOT Network requires a membership fee, but participants in Google's Patent Starter Program won't have to pay it for two years. There are a number of additional catches that come with the patents, but for the most part they're safety nets for Google. Google retains a license to any patent it gives away; participants must remain LOT Network members for two years or else lose the patents; and participants may only use the patents defensively or else be financially penalized by Google. Most of those conditions are permanent, but the companies that participate in the Starter Program appear to be free to leave the LOT Network after two years. Google's hope, apparently, is that they won't. ""The bigger the network gets, the more protection the membership gets against future attacks from patent trolls,"" it writes. Supporting the network, it says, is ""a great long-term"" way to continue that fight. Google has been one of many loud voices in Silicon Valley fighting back against patent trolls. Earlier this year, it launched a complementary initiative that made it easy for companies to sell patents to Google, so that patent holders could make some money without putting patents in the hands of trolls. The LOT Network is also part of its recent efforts. It was founded just over a year ago, and it now has 21 listed members. That includes, most recently, the Wikimedia Foundation.

You get a relatively cheap mobile hotspot and data, but it's open to anybody. If somebody near you uses it, you'll get free data added to your plan. But the best part of the Karma system isn't the scheme to try to get free data, it's the way you pay for it: flat-rate data without any monthly plan. You pay for what you use and nothing more. If you leave it in a drawer for six months, it doesn't cost you a penny. A clever system, but there was a big hangup — back in 2013 when it launched, it relied on Sprint's doomed WiMAX network. But in September 2014, Karma announced a new model was coming with LTE for $149, due out in December. Delays, as they often do with small hardware companies, kept the device from shipping until just this week. Now that it's here and I've been using it for a couple of days, I'm still more intrigued by the theory than the execution. But I'm very intrigued. A well-built little puck The Karma Go is a svelte, well-built little puck that I wasn't afraid to chuck in my back pocket and forget about. It's smaller than most of the other mobile hotspotsI've used, and seems to be well-built. A mobile hotspot is a simple tool, and the Karma Go is honest about that. Karma says that it lasts for about five hours of continuous use — but I got slightly less than that. Part of that might be because I let it go into sleep mode overnight instead of fully powering it down. But that desire for simplicity means that, feature-wise, the Karma Go is pretty basic. Unlike devices that are loaded up with an LCD screen, the Karma Go makes do with a single button and four LED lights. Three indicate signal strength and one is for battery life. But there are times when you just want to get more info out of your internet gadget: just how many devices are connected? Am I on LTE or 3G? Just how much time do I really have left before the battery konks out?   If you want answers to those questions, you'll need to install the Karma Wi-Fi app on your Android or iPhone — or visit Karma's website from your computer. There, you'll see what devices have been connected and how much data they use. But Karma's app doesn't let you do everything you might expect. For one, you only have a few options for naming your Wi-Fi network. Karma defaults to using the name you enter when you sign up for the service — something I wasn't really pleased to find out. The other big thing you can't do is set the password for your mobile hotspot. It's always open to anybody who wants to use it. That's part of Karma's model for getting new customers. If somebody joins your Wi-Fi network, they are asked to create a new Karma account to get online. (They'll get 100MB free to start.) If they do, you'll get some free bonus data. Karma says that there's no way that somebody on your Wi-Fi network will be able to use it to sniff out your internet activities. I'm not particularly interested in Karma's business model here, and if I had my druthers I wouldn't let anybody jump on and share my connection — even with LTE, a mobile connection can be a perilously scarce resource. Sprint's network has fallen behind Which brings me to the elephant hidden inside this little gadget: the Sprint network. In New York, I've found that Sprint isn't nearly as good as either Verizon or AT&T. It's absolutely useless in my office, for example, even though the Karma Go shows full bars (er, full dots). When I do get proper service, speeds are slower than what I can get with other networks, too. So the idea of sharing a signal I already don't fully trust is bothersome. Also, since it's on Sprint, you're out of luck if you want to use the Karma Go outside the US. That open Wi-Fi network doesn't just work for anybody who sees it, of course. The sign-in method uses a ""captive portal,"" which is one of those websites that make you log in before you can access the broader internet — you've probably seen them at hotels or Starbucks. Luckily, most phones and computers can handle those just fine with a quick pop-up. Once a device is recognized, I've found I don't have to re-enter my credentials every time I connect. But a captive portal also means that the Karma Go won't work with any device that can't log in via a website — so if you're hoping to use it with an Apple TV or a Chromecast while you're at a hotel, you're out of luck. Karma says it's working to find a way to support those ""faceless"" devices. And yet! Despite all of those hurdles I'm so happy with the idea that I don't have to pay a monthly fee for this thing that I'm willing to live with all of those problems. I don't like the annoying captive portal, the open Wi-Fi signal anybody can use, the aggressively simple design, and above all Sprint's network. But I know that each one of those annoyances are necessary to make the Karma Go's payment plan work. Karma needs the captive portal and open Wi-Fi to entice new customers. Above all, it needs the super cheap rates that Sprint charges bulk customers. Aggravating technical limitations and basic features, but I love it It all means that I can have LTE data for around $14 per gigabyte. That’s a little more than I’d like — Google’s new Fi network only charges $10 per gigabyte, for example. But then again, I don’t have an extra monthly data plan sucking down my bank account.

We've already seen images of a dummy phone revealing the design of the S6 Edge Plus — yes, it's just a bigger version of the regular model. These latest photos, posted by Mobile Fun (and snapped with an iPhone), show the device running Android 5.1.1. Presumably that fresh version of Android will also be running on the Galaxy Note 5, which is certainly the more interesting of these two phones.   Assuming these photos are legitimate (they're pretty blurry with some questionable image artifacts), the Note 5 looks like an enlarged version of the Galaxy S6, but with corners that aren't quite as rounded. Samsung seems poised to carry over the glass-and-metal design, as the same antenna lines from the S6 are also visible on this phone. Aside from that, there's not much to see other than a home button and a tempered glass screen protector shielding the display.   It's been reported that the Note 5 will feature an even faster processor than the S6, 4GB of RAM, a massive battery, and perhaps even a USB Type-C port. Unfortunately, these photos don't directly confirm or refute rumors that Samsung will be ditching a removable battery and microSD storage for the Note line — just as it's already done with the S6. But the company is said to be planning an earlier-than-usual reveal in mid-August, so we'll know far more in a matter of weeks.

It will also be more powerful, with 20 percent more thrust using liquid hydrogen and oxygen as fuel. Last week, NASA announced that the Space Launch System, SLS for short, is on track to perform its first unmanned test launch in 2018. The larger goal is to carry humans into orbit around an asteroid, and then to Mars by the 2030s. After that, NASA says the rocket could be used to reach Saturn and Jupiter.  At the moment, even getting off the ground would be progress: since the retirement of the Space Shuttle in 2011, NASA has been left without any domestic capability to launch American astronauts into space; instead it has been purchasing rides for them aboard Russian Soyuz spacecraft at high cost. While SpaceX and other private companies are working furiously to provide their own human passenger spacecraft for travel into Earth's orbit, NASA wants to go even further. The agency has begun testing models of the SLS and initial construction of some the major components. It says the first test flight will have an initial cost of $7 billion. The SLS will also be reusing some leftover parts from the inventory of the retired Space Shuttle, including its engines.  However, as with many large NASA projects, the SLS has already been delayed from an initial flight in 2017, and lawmakers in Congress, who must approve NASA's budget, are concerned about further delays and cost overruns. Whether NASA is able to keep the project on track remains to be seen, but at the moment, it's all systems go. Check out the progress and promise in photos and conceptual illustrations below.

But doctors used a 3D printed brain to pioneer a medical breakthrough and give him a normal life Come along with The Verge for the second season of Detours. We’ve traveled across the country to find the people, groups, and companies that are solving America’s problems in new and unconventional ways. On a Tuesday last summer, Erin Mandeville was at a CVS buying medicine for her five-month-old baby, Gabriel. Close to 4PM, she noticed her infant’s eyes roll back in quick succession. It was the first of Gabriel’s many episodes of infantile spasms that would follow. Spasms or epileptic seizures can be catastrophic for young children. Doctors at Boston Children’s Hospital tried every route and medicine to help Gabriel as his seizures progressed aggressively. ""He was missing huge milestones in his childhood,"" said Mandeville. Doctors eventually suggested a hemispherectomy, a complicated operation that disconnects the healthy half of the brain from the one causing seizures. ""I didn’t know how invasive it would be,"" Gabriel’s mother said. ""But, if it was going to make him have a better life, it was an easy choice to make."" Mandeville’s choice was made easier knowing that Gabriel would be the first infant whose brain would be replicated by a 3D printer for a practice run prior to the operation.  ""This is a printed version that the surgeon can hold, cut, manipulate, and look for things."" A hemispherectomy is ""one of the most challenging operations in pediatric epilepsy surgery,"" says Dr. Joseph Madsen, director of the epilepsy program at Boston Children’s.  A dress rehearsal is beneficial even for the most highly experienced surgeons. ""This is a printed version that the surgeon can hold, cut, manipulate, and look for things,"" he says, holding Gabriel’s printed brain in his hand. For surgeons-in-training, the simulation is a blessing. ""No one wants to be the first person to get a hemispherectomy from a surgeon, ever,"" he adds. The 3D print of Gabriel’s brain was developed by the Simulator Program at the hospital. The model is printed in soft plastic with a precision of 16 microns per layer; blood vessels are set in contrast color for easier navigation. Gabriel’s parents were privy to the process and anticipated complications. Gabriel’s subsequent surgery earlier this year took close to 10 hours, and went according to plan. ""Surgical preparation via simulation allows surgeons to hit the ground a lot faster,"" says Dr. Peter Weinstock, director of the Simulator Program. ""We can’t be prepared for every possibility, but we can chop off a large number of complications."" Though medical simulations are nothing new, the Simulator Program surpasses conventional systems with next-generation mannequins and 3D printing. The team behind the program includes surgeons, specialists, radiologists, and engineers, and is currently gathering data to validate its implications on surgical times, anesthetic times, and patient safety. ""We can chop off a large number of complications."" Within a year of its inception, the project has developed close to 100 prints — 20 percent of those have made their way into operating rooms. Dr. Weinstock suggests that in the future, on-demand anatomy printing could make its way into emergency rooms to meet the needs of trauma cases. ""The technology is coming,"" he said. ""The question is: how do we develop and make use of the technology that will have an immediate effect on how we take care of children?"" Gabriel, now 18 months, is seizure-free. Challenges can be expected. ""But, kids’ brains are so resilient,"" his mother says. ""He’s already re-wired himself. He’s starting to hit the milestones he missed — he wakes up smiling every day.""",0.5170225781162923,0.48297742188370774,0.8665413059160456,609,5.2380952380952381,361,6.3767313019390581,1,0,"Science, Detours",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The rover, which is now over 10 years old and well beyond its original mission lifetime, reset itself over a dozen times last month because of what NASA says is likely an issue with worn-out flash memory that it's attempting to store data in. Pieces of flash memory can wear out after repeated use, and it's possible that the rover is still attempting to use these worn-out parts of its memory.  ""The flash reformatting is a low-risk process."" ""The flash reformatting is a low-risk process, as critical sequences and flight software are stored elsewhere in other non-volatile memory on the rover,"" John Callas, project manager for NASA's Mars Exploration Rover Project, says in a statement. By reformatting the memory, NASA says that it'll be able to identify and disable use of the bad flash memory cells, hopefully avoiding frequent resets like these for the foreseeable future. All ""useful"" data remaining on Opportunity will be downloaded before it's reformatted, and the rover will communicate with NASA at a slower data rate during the formatting process in order to improve reliability of the transmission. This will be the first memory reformat for Opportunity, which is currently about 125 million miles from NASA's California-based Jet Propulsion Laboratory. This won't be the first Mars rover to undergo a reformat though: NASA's Spirit rover, which landed on Mars just before Opportunity but is no longer operational, underwent a memory reformat back in 2009, five years after landing. Opportunity's reformatting is planned for next month. The rover was last reported to be traveling toward Mars' Marathon Valley, which is believed to be rich in clay minerals.

For the past 18 years, a company called DeepFlight has specialized in creating high-end, recreational submarines for well-off aquatic adventurers. As the company proudly notes on its website: ""DeepFlight personal submarines are ideal toys for superyachts, resorts, and tour operators because of their capability to open up the undersea world in three dimensions.""  In an added twist that seems almost too good to be true, the company was founded by Graham Hawkes, a longtime British marine engineer who built and piloted a submarine that attacked James Bond in the 1980 film For Your Eyes Only. Hawkes and DeepFlight were recently the subject of an enthralling Betabeat profile, in which the founder relates stories of piloting his craft with the likes of Richard Branson (Silicon Valley venture capitalist Tom Perkins is another DeepFlight submarine owner). Aside from beauty and underwater luxury, DeepFlight's main selling point is that its submarines (five different models have been created so far, each improving upon the last) are designed to be faster and more fun to pilot than typical deepwater exploration submarines, mimicking winged aircraft (hence the company's name). The latest and greatest of these models is the $1.7 million Super Falcon Mark II, a sleek, 17-foot long (5.2 meter) vessel that carries two and can dive to nearly 400 feet. See it rendered in beautiful promotional images and actual photographs below. The company is currently taking orders for its next submarine, the Dragon, renders of which can be seen here.

A new study from the German government, reported by The Telegraph, shows that more than one in three wild boar killed by hunters in the region are too radioactive to be safe for humans to eat. Since 2012, hunters in the Saxony region of Germany have had to get any wild boar they kill tested for radiation. In one year, the state reports that 297 of 752 boar tested contained more than the safe limit of 600 becquerels of radioactive material caesium-137 per kilogram for human consumption. Some boar tested had radiation levels dozens of times higher than the safe limit. Some boar had radioactive material dozens of times higher than the safe limit Saxony is 700 miles from Chernobyl, where a 1986 explosion at a nuclear plant sent radioactive material into the atmosphere. Subsequent rain and wind carried the radioactive material far and wide across Europe. It's thought that boar are more susceptible to radiation contamination because their diet consists of mushrooms and truffles that are buried in the ground and hold radiation longer than other vegetation.

And perhaps today's most quickly evolving language is emoji, more and more of which are added each year in response to how we use the quirky symbols and which new ones we want. Today marks an incredible day in emoji's evolution: the release of Unicode 8, the next version of the standard behind emoji. And Unicode 8 just happens to contain support for one of the most requested images of all time, the taco. It's not clear why the taco is so in demand. Probably just because it's a really great format for food. There's a good taco place down the street from me, and I can imagine myself using a taco emoji all the time when asking people to go there. ""Want to go out for [taco emoji]?"" I'd ask. I think we all feel that way. Google suggests that interest in a taco emoji has been increasing for years.   This day in emoji history will be second only to the day when the taco emoji is actually put inside our phones. For now, the taco is only real in an abstract sense. Eventually, maybe in iOS 10 or Android 5.3, we'll be gifted with a taco emoji that we can actually see and use. There's actually even more good news in this Unicode update. Not only are we getting a taco emoji, we're also getting a burrito emoji and a hot dog emoji. Religious symbols and sports symbols are being added as well; there are 41 new emoji in total. On top of all of that, this update actually includes the diverse emoji that Apple implemented a few months ago — it kind of jumped the gun on that one — so we should start to see support for it elsewhere soon.

The United States has closely scrutinized past deals in which foreign bodies proposed the purchase of a major infrastructure of telecommunications company. In this case, the use of IBM servers by the FBI, Pentagon, and US telecoms is reportedly behind the raised concern. The interagency Committee on Foreign Investment in the US will reportedly be reviewing the deal.  The US has blocked foreign purchases over national security concerns before In addition to the use of IBM servers at government agencies, Bloomberg reports that the committee will investigate their usage within critical US infrastructure, including chemical plants and electric companies. Regulators' primary concern is likely that the purchase could allow China, where Lenovo is headquartered, to access US secrets or gain control over its infrastructure. Lenovo previously purchased IBM's ThinkPad business in 2005. IBM tells Bloomberg that it's confident that the review will have a ""positive outcome."" Bloomberg reports that one term of the deal that may help Lenovo clear the purchase is a five-year contract that has IBM itself continuing to service server equipment — meaning that Lenovo wouldn't have access to it. That agreement can reportedly be extended as well. If the deal fails, Lenovo has agreed to pay IBM a fee of $200 million, according to Bloomberg. Bloomberg doesn't seem to know how much of a risk there is of that happening, but it's no surprise that Lenovo's purchase of computer infrastructure in the US is gaining increased attention amid growing concerns over cyberwarfare, particularly from China.

Cover suggests that development will cease on its eponymous app for the time being, though it says that the app will remain available in the Play Store. It's likely then that Twitter isn't interested in taking over your lock screen so much as it's interested in Cover's creators and their experience with intelligently surfacing information — something that it can certainly put to use.  The acquisition appears to be about talent It's also possible that Twitter is looking to flesh out its Android team, which recently saw the loss of Sara Haider, one of its key Android app developers. That said, sources tell us that this acquisition is unrelated to the Haider's departure. Haider was most recently working on Vine's Android app, while the team from Cover will be working at Twitter directly. If Twitter is interested in taking over your lock screen, this acquisition would instead be the start of a far more ambitious initiative. Facebook attempted something similar last year with the launch of Facebook Home, and though it's failed to gain much traction in the time since, it's clear why Facebook gave it a shot: taking over a phone's lock screen would give it a powerful advantage by making its own content the first thing that a person sees when checking their phone. Twitter could also try for something like this by expanding Cover's abilities beyond apps and into tweets, news, and trends. For now though, it appears that Twitter isn't interested in controlling your lock screen — it's certainly seen the lack of demand for Facebook Home, after all — but we may just see a smarter version of its Android app sometime down the road thanks to the Cover team's background in using contextual information to change what an app chooses to show you.",0.6077797021299771,0.3922202978700229,0.1692355093313637,331,4.8912386706948636,195,5.4410256410256412,0,0,"Apps, Business, Tech",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

The Danny DeVito to Kickstarter's Arnold Schwarzenegger, Indiegogo has been the perpetual second player in online crowdfunding. Second is no bad place to be in a rapidly expanding market, however, and Indiegogo has managed to attract a number of high-profile projects from the likes of Shaq, Ubuntu, and even the Jamaican bobsled team. Though interest in and backing for crowdfunding have never been more plentiful, there remains a significant element of risk, which has been highlighted by a recent report from Pando Daily. Taking issue with the Healbe GoBe campaign — a wearable device that claims to automatically measure your calorie intake, level of hydration, and stress level — the reporter investigated the company behind the project and found frightfully little to reassure Indiegogo backers that their money would be safe. Healbe advertises itself as being based in San Francisco, but is operated out of Moscow, and its non-invasive glucose measurements have been questioned by professional clinicians. Both company and product invite a healthy dose of skepticism, yet the project's lofty aspirations have been appealing enough to entice over $930,000 in contributions. The latest twist in the story has seen Indiegogo change its fraud FAQ page overnight, expunging a promise to catch ""any and all cases of fraud."" In a defensive move ostensibly prompted by being so closely scrutinized, the company has softened the assurance that ""all claims and contributions go through a fraud review"" to asserting that only those ""flagged by our fraud detection system go through a thorough review."" While that may sound like a regressive change, it actually brings Indiegogo’s public communications closer in line with the (few) legal responsibilities it accepts.  ""Indiegogo has no fiduciary duty to you."" The key reason for the existence of centralized funding platforms like Indiegogo or Kickstarter is trust. Funders need to be assured that their money is going toward the stated goals, and project creators require some certainty of the promised income. But what is that trust actually based on? Peruse Kickstarter's Terms of Use and you'll find the following disquieting message: Further still, Kickstarter can't guarantee the identity of users you interact with, nor can it guarantee the receipt of pledged amounts. Indiegogo matches that language in its own documentation, asserting that ""Indiegogo has no fiduciary duty to you."" The legal responsibility for ensuring that a given project isn't fraudulent or otherwise illegal falls squarely on the funder's shoulders: Of course, legal language tends to be overreaching by default, and neither Indiegogo nor Kickstarter take the potential for malfeasance lightly. Kickstarter banned product renders in late 2012 — demanding instead that prototypes be photographed in their current form — in an effort to improve transparency and to ensure that there's something concrete underpinning a project pitch. Indiegogo identifies ""trust"" as one of its three central pillars for improving the user experience, and the company claims to have a ""comprehensive fraud-prevention system to protect [its] users."" Familiarity breeds complacency Whether the Healbe GoBe is a legitimate product or not is less important than the circumstances of its campaign. A company without any track record has accumulated close to a million dollars from people willing to believe its claims, and at least part of that trust has been built on the fact that it's advertised on a recognized platform. This is a case where familiarity may very well breed complacency, with Indiegogo users operating on the assumption that the website can protect their interests. That's what Indiegogo wants to do, but it's far from certain that it's what the company is capable of doing. Indiegogo has a low threshold for listing projects for funding, as illustrated by the distinctly dubious No More Woof campaign built around a supposed mind-reading headset for dogs. Moreover, the platform’s flexible funding option — where a project collects all contributions whether it achieves its target funding or not — and the fact you’re charged before campaigns have run their course make it inherently more risky than supporting someone via Kickstarter. The latter service has already seen bad products vetted and debunked by the community during campaigns that would otherwise have been successful. Making a million dollars shouldn't be this easy At the same time, the all-or-nothing absolutism of Kickstarter funding also ensures that you only pay if production can realistically be achieved. In the case of the Healbe GoBe, you could spend $199 expecting to get one for yourself, but if the product isn’t popular enough, the company might take your money without delivering any tangible return. And that's not a rare occurrence, given that only 10 percent of Indiegogo projects are fully funded. The great irony of crowdfunding is that it ultimately boils down to a direct one-to-one relationship between a project’s creator and individual backers. Indiegogo is the middleman in that relationship: it connects, it facilitates, but it doesn’t actually assume any of the legal responsibility. The full terms and conditions of using the service articulate that point repeatedly, however the warm and friendly presentation, plus highly visible crowdfunded successes like the Oculus Rift, may well lull potential backers into a false sense of security. In the end, Indiegogo’s greatest risk may be to itself — if it doesn’t evolve to provide better tools for assessing projects and real checks and balances to weed out the dubious ones, it may lose the one indispensable contribution from all of its users: their trust.",0.5225280830621295,0.4774719169378705,0.1680077950219864,910,5.395604395604396,504,6.7261904761904763,0,0,"Business, Culture, Web, Report",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

Hampton Catlin, a prominent developer of apps for the nascent Firefox OS, announced he was abandoning the platform due to Eich’s handling of the disclosure that in 2008 he donated $1,000 to the fight against same-sex marriage. California’s Proposition 8, which passed with 52 percent of the vote in 2008, made same-sex marriage illegal in California until the law was overturned by the Supreme Court. Over the course of an hour, Catlin explained the suffering that Prop. 8 caused for him and his partner, a Brit who couldn’t immigrate until marriage became legal. Catlin asked Eich for an apology. He didn’t get one. Instead, Eich resigned as CEO and stepped down from the board of the Mozilla foundation. ""Mozilla prides itself on being held to a different standard and, this past week, we didn’t live up to it,"" the company’s executive chairwoman, Mitchell Baker, said in a blog post today. ""We know why people are hurt and angry, and they are right: it’s because we haven’t stayed true to ourselves."" Suddenly Eich, who formerly served as Mozilla’s chief technical officer and previously invented the programming language JavaScript, was out of a company he co-founded in 1998. ""It may be challenging for a CEO, but everyone in our community can have different beliefs about all sorts of things that may be in conflict,"" Eich told CNET earlier in the week. But the challenge proved greater than his leadership. ""We haven't stayed true to ourselves."" In nearly two decades working on Mozilla’s mission, Eich became known as a brilliant technician and a crusader for the open web. But after becoming Mozilla’s CEO 11 days ago, Eich became known primarily for his opposition to same-sex marriage. In an era when Jeff Bezos donates millions of dollars in support of marriage equality in Washington and Mark Zuckerberg marches in the San Francisco Pride parade, Eich stood out both for his opposition and his refusal to discuss his beliefs. His appointment sparked an extraordinarily public debate between him and the broader Mozilla community over when a CEO can claim a right to his own unpopular beliefs — and what should happen when those beliefs clash with the written values of his company. But Eich found little public support for his argument that he could uphold Mozilla’s commitment to equality at work while funding discrimination at home. Negative reactions from employees, developers, and even OKCupid began to roil Mozilla at a time when the shift to mobile devices has left its core product and revenue source, the desktop Firefox web browser, looking increasingly like a relic. The Eich controversy was distracting Mozilla from its efforts to compete in the new world, and ultimately may have even hindered the open web itself. ""It’s clear that Brendan cannot lead Mozilla in this setting,"" Baker told Recode. ""The ability to lead — particularly for the CEO — is fundamental to the role and that is not possible here."" The road to Eich’s departure is filled with unlikely twists. For starters, Mozilla already fought this battle once, in 2012. That’s when Eich’s donation first became public, leading to a firestorm on Twitter. He responded with a blog post in which he took exception to being labeled a bigot, and asserted what would become a refrain when the issue resurfaced last month: that Mozillians should focus on their shared mission, and not require participants to first pass an ideological purity test. Otherwise, he wrote, ""these communities will tend to splinter, and that is likely to be a net loss for everyone."" The controversy quickly died down, perhaps because Eich was then merely Mozilla’s chief technical officer and not, as now, its public face. But the tension lingered. Meanwhile, Eich’s views were rapidly growing out of step with his fellow Americans. In 2008, opposing gay marriage was a view shared by a majority of Americans. (Eich’s opposition to gay marriage was shared, in 2008, by Barack Obama.) But by 2014, views had shifted: more than half the country now supports same-sex marriage — Obama included. Few who went to the polls in 2008 would have guessed that donating to Prop. 8 would later be seen as an offense that disqualified a person from running a company. But those calling for Eich’s resignation said his financial support would affect Mozilla’s ability to attract and retain talent. It may also have had a negative effect on fundraising at the Mozilla Foundation, which operates separately from the company that makes Firefox and relies on private donations to further its advocacy of the open web. Did Eich even want this job? Perhaps the biggest surprise in all this is that Mozilla, an organization that employs a host of LGBT people and vocally supports same-sex marriage, came to be led by someone who donated money to stop it from happening. As Mozilla’s co-founder and CTO, Eich was hardly a dark-horse candidate for the job. But his appointment came only at the end of a protracted search that saw the board first interview and reject 25 other candidates. In an interview with VentureBeat, Eich all but said he wished he hadn’t taken the job. ""I was asked to put my hat in, and at first I didn’t want to,"" he told the publication. ""But now I’m it."" The week before Eich was announced as CEO, half the board quit. Mozilla says that two board members had long planned to leave and that the third, venture capitalist and former Mozilla CEO John Lilly, left for reasons unrelated to the Prop. 8 donation. But the departures have contributed to the impression that company is in turmoil. Eich’s departure today, which came without any news of who might step into the CEO role, will only add to that impression. Mozilla declined to make Eich available for an interview. But he told CNET that if his resignation were forced, it would bode ill for Mozilla and the web. ""Mozilla is under a threat here. We don’t know how big,"" he said. ""If Mozilla cannot continue to operate according to its principles of inclusiveness, where you can work on the mission no matter what your background or other beliefs, I think we’ll probably fail."" Eich suggested that Mozillians in Indonesia largely oppose same-sex marriage, and might abandon the project if they felt that their views would not be accepted in the organization. But voices in Mozilla’s home country proved louder, and more persuasive. ""A sad victory."" Catlin, for his part, called Eich’s departure ""a sad victory."" ""He can still keep his personal beliefs, but I wanted him to recognize that we faced real issues with immigration and say that he never intended to cause people problems,"" Catlin wrote on his blog. ""It’s heartbreaking to us that he was unwilling to say even that."" Still, at the end of his post Catlin said he would return to developing apps for Firefox OS — precisely the sort of response that those calling for Eich’s ouster had hoped for. In coming months, Mozilla’s next CEO will have to address pressing questions about its declining share of the desktop-browser market, its languishing mobile apps, and the wildly uncertain future of its mobile operating system. Those problems would have proved tricky to navigate whether Eich was CEO or not. In the meantime, the question of whether a CEO can leave his beliefs at the door when he walks into work seems to have been answered firmly in the negative. When a CEO’s values clash with the values of the company he leads, expect the company to win. .video-wrap {margin-top: 0px !important;}  ",0.4791103041910513,0.5208896958089487,0.8561211936211746,1303,4.9646968534151954,646,6.2244582043343657,1,0,"Business, Tech, Report",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

The same groups that brought down SOPA seem to be turning their attention to the recent Goliath news.

Both sides presented closing arguments in an Oakland, California courthouse today after two full weeks of trial, painting vastly different pictures of what was happening at both Apple and within the digital music business some 10 years ago. If the jury ultimately decides against Apple, there could be a stiff penalty. While the complaint originally asked for $350 million, that number would be tripled under antitrust laws. ""I liken it to blowing up your iPod ... It's worse than a paperweight.""  During its closing, the plaintiffs in the case argued that Apple's iTunes 7.0, released in September 2006, contained what attorney Patrick Coughlin referred to as a ""one-two punch"" that ""knocked out competitors."" Version 7.0 included a security feature that verified a user's iTunes library with Apple's FairPlay digital rights management (DRM). That was followed up a year later with a software update that did the same check on iPods. Once activated, these security measures did a number of things, from keeping iPods from playing songs that had DRM that had been tampered with, to keeping third parties from changing the database of songs with jukebox software apps. On top of all that, Coughlin said, was that the newfound threat that the software could wipe users' iPods if the system detected abnormalities with their library. ""I liken it to blowing up your iPod,"" Coughlin told jurors. ""It's worse than a paperweight. You could lose everything!"" In its closing, Apple's lawyer Bill Isaacson fired back, calling that claim nonsense. ""There is no evidence this ever happened,"" he said. ""There is no evidence anyone went through the restore process and ever had this happen. Not even a complaint about it."" Isaacson's fellow Apple lawyer Karen Dunn took it one step further. ""Plaintiffs don’t understand the technology in this case,"" she told the jury. ""Witness after witness said ‘you don’t understand what I wrote.’"" Over the course of the trial, Apple has argued that these changes were made specifically to keep out malicious efforts to strip DRM and possibly inject dangerous code onto a user's computer, as well as uphold stipulations in deals the company had with record labels to patch security holes. In his testimony, for instance, Apple's iTunes and iCloud chief Eddy Cue said that the company basically had a countdown timer that started once a hack was found, with the very real threat of forfeiting its deals with the record labels if they weren't able to patch it. The company's experts, including iTunes software architect Jeff Robbin, have also suggested there were ample warnings to users before the software would wipe a device. But today, the plaintiffs once again suggested that these changes came about because Apple was simply enjoying — and in fear of losing — its dominance of the digital music market. ""When they had success, they were locking down the iPod."" ""When they had success, they were locking down the iPod, or locking down specific competitors,"" Coughlin said. ""They could use the DRM to do that."" Key among those competitors, though not a part of the lawsuit, is RealNetworks and its Harmony software. It was one of myriad projects that cropped up shortly after Apple's iTunes Music Store launch in 2003 that attempted to strip the FairPlay DRM, or act as a replacement to iTunes as a way to manage the iPod. But for the purpose of the case, the plaintiffs have used it as a prime example of Apple wanting to create a monopoly for FairPlay, pointing to an attempt by RealNetworks' CEO to license the DRM that was rebuffed by late Apple CEO Steve Jobs. Apple returned fire in its closing, calling RealNetworks ""one small competitor."" Earlier in the trial, the company noted that Real's tracks accounted for less than one percent of music people were purchasing from music stores at the time. And today, in its closing, it reminded jurors that its own expert found Real's software to be buggy enough to corrupt playlists, cause music to disappear, and mangle filenames when used with Apple's iPods. The jury needs to figure out whether iTunes 7.0 actually made things better The jury's key job is deciding whether iTunes 7.0 can be considered a ""genuine product improvement,"" one that actually made things better for consumers. That's been at odds in this case, with the plaintiffs saying the security changes were steps backward, while Apple's pointed to other features that came with iTunes 7.0 — movies, higher resolution videos, Cover Flow for albums, and support for video games — as making it better. ""We now have a plaintiff that is asking you to hold Apple liable for innovating, for providing security, that is what they are asking you to do,"" Isaacson said to the jury. ""They are doing that and asking you to hold us liable for providing consumers a choice, for providing integrated products, for providing iPod plus iTunes, and saying that's how our products work best."" A 65-year-old ice skater may save the case There was plenty of sparring leading up to today, including whether the plaintiffs' side would actually be allowed to have someone represent the some 8 million people who bought devices during the claim period. The two plaintiffs who filed the suit were removed earlier in the trial after evidence emerged that they either did not buy the correct devices or bought them outside the time period of the complaint. Barbara Bennett, a 65-year-old ice skater who bought an iPod nano in 2006, eventually emerged as a replacement, but did not get a chance to testify in front of the jury. Now that the closings are done the jury begins its deliberation. Though unlikely, a verdict could come as soon as this evening.",0.370404312338597,0.6295956876614031,0.8679558404456427,1032,4.9631782945736438,528,5.9867424242424239,0,0,"Apple, Policy & Law, Tech, US & World, Report",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

Delivering a unanimous verdict today, the group said Apple's iTunes 7.0, released in the fall of 2006, was a ""genuine product improvement,"" meaning that new features (though importantly increased security) were good for consumers. Plaintiffs in the case unsuccessfully argued that those features not only thwarted competition, but also made Apple's products less useful since customers could not as easily use purchased music or jukebox software from other companies with the iPod. The decision means Apple did not violate antitrust laws, something that would have potentially led to damages of more than $1 billion. The complaint originally asked for damages of more than $350 million to pay a class of 8 million people who bought certain iPod models between September 2006 and the end of March in 2009. ""We thank the jury for their service and we applaud their verdict,"" Apple said in a statement. ""We created iPod and iTunes to give our customers the world’s best way to listen to music. Every time we've updated those products — and every Apple product over the years — we’ve done it to make the user experience even better."" ""At least we got a chance to get it in front of the jury."" Following the verdict, the plaintiff's head attorney Patrick Coughlin said an appeal is already planned. He also expressed frustrations over getting two of the security features — one that checks the iTunes database, and another that checks each song on the iPod itself — lumped together with the other user-facing features in the iTunes 7.0 update, like support for movies and games. ""At least we got a chance to get it in front of the jury,"" he told reporters. Apple's lawyers declined to comment, as did the jurors. All along, Apple's made the case that its music store, jukebox software, and hardware was simply an integrated system similar to video game consoles from Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo. It built all those pieces to work together, and thus it would be unusual to expect any one piece from another company to work without issues, Apple's attorneys said. But more importantly, Apple offered, any the evolution of its DRM that ended up locking out competitors was absolutely necessary given deals it had with the major record companies to patch security holes. The nearly two-week-long trial over the complaint, which was originally filed in 2005, wrapped up yesterday after both sides had a chance to make closing arguments. It originally stemmed from issues two customers said they had taking their paid music library to devices made by other companies, as well as not being able to use songs they paid for in other stores on their iPods.

""Warning[.] We will clearly show it to you at the very time and places 'The Interview' be shown, including the premiere, how bitter fate those who seek fun in terror should be doomed to,"" the note says. The hackers also reference 9/11 in making the threat.

Whatever comes in the coming days is called by the greed of Sony Pictures Entertainment. All the world will denounce the SONY.   The threat was included alongside the release of another set of emails, this time said to be those of Sony Entertainment CEO Michael Lynton. Because the hackers post this information anonymously and are contacting reporters through reusable email addresses, it is possible that a separate party is behind this threat. However, that seems unlikely. The communications have been consistent, and it should be clear soon whether the leaked emails are genuine, confirming the authenticity of this note. Homeland Security says that it has no real evidence to suggest that these threats will be carried out. ""We are still analyzing the credibility of these statements, but at this time there is no credible intelligence to indicate an active plot against movie theaters within the United States,"" the department says in an email to Variety. The film premiered in Los Angeles last week, and the LAPD says that it will be increasing security around theaters throughout the holidays. ""We take those threats very seriously and we will take extra precautions during the holidays and at theaters,"" LAPD chief Charlie Beck tells The Wrap. North Korea has denied involvement It's widely suspected that North Korea has played a role in these attacks, with evidence pointing in that direction as well. However, North Korea has denied any involvement, and it's possible that the evidence ultimately won't be convincing enough to pin the hack on it. Even so, it's been made quite clear that North Korea is unhappy with Sony over of its work on The Interview, a comedy about an assassination attempt on Kim Jong-un that ends with his potentially graphic death. The film is planned for a Christmas day release. The attack on Sony began in late November, when the company's computer system's were shut down worldwide. A group calling itself ""Guardians of Peace"" has taken credit for the attack, and over the past week, they've begun to release stolen Sony data, including the emails of top executives. Those emails have included everything from work on upcoming films to schemes to disrupt Google and the open internet as a means of protecting their copyright. That's proven to be quite a headache for Sony. Aside from its plans being made public, many of the emails have also been quite embarrassing for its top employees. Around 47,000 social security numbers were also released, and Sony is now being sued for failing to protect that data.

But leaked documents reveal a frightening line of attack that's currently being considered by the MPAA: What if you simply erased any record that the site was there in the first place? A bold challenge to the basic engineering of the internet  To do that, the MPAA's lawyers would target the Domain Name System (DNS) that directs traffic across the internet. The tactic was first proposed as part of the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) in 2011, but three years after the law failed in Congress, the MPAA has been looking for legal justification for the practice in existing law and working with ISPs like Comcast to examine how a system might work technically. If the system works, DNS-blocking could be the key to the MPAA's long-standing goal of blocking sites from delivering content to the US. At the same time, it represents a bold challenge to the basic engineering of the internet, threatening to break the very backbone of the web and drawing the industry into an increasingly nasty fight with Google. The Domain Name System is a kind of phone book for the internet, translating URLs like http://www.theverge.com into IP addresses like 192.5.151.3. Given a URL string, your computer will turn to a DNS server (often run by a local ISP or a third party like Google) to find the IP address of the corresponding server. Much like the phone book, that function is usually treated as a simple an engineering task — but a memo commissioned by the MPAA this August sketches out a legal case for blocking infringing sites from the DNS records entirely, like wiping unsavory addresses out of the phone book. You could still type http://www.piratebay.se into your browser, but without a working DNS record, you wouldn't be able to find the site itself. If a takedown notice could blacklist a site from every available DNS provider, the URL would be effectively erased from the internet. Without a friendly DNS provider, the URL would be effectively erased from the internet No one's ever tried to issue a takedown notice like that, but this latest memo suggests the MPAA is looking into it as a potentially powerful new tool in the fight against piracy. ""A takedown notice program, therefore, could threaten ISPs with potential secondary liability in the event that they do not cease connecting users to known infringing material through their own DNS servers,"" the letter reads. ""While not making it impossible for users to reach pirate sites (i.e., a user could still use a third-party DNS server), it could make it substantially more complicated for casual infringers to reach pirate sites if their ISPs decline to assist in the routing of communications to those sites."" The full document is embedded below.  ""It could make it substantially more complicated for casual infringers to reach pirate sites"" That would give content owners a powerful new tool against piracy, but that power could be ripe for abuse. As critics pointed out in the SOPA debate, site-blocking measures could also be used by bad actors to knock a site offline with just a bogus copyright claim. DMCA notices have already drawn criticism for overly hasty or broadly applied blocks, and extending that power to DNS records would spread those problems across the web at large. Crucially, any takedown notices deployed under this scheme would simply invoke the threat of liability and further legal action, pressuring the DNS servers to delist the site without ever hearing the issue in court. The MPAA’s legal argument centers on the claim that DNS records are working as an index or directory rather than simply routing data. If that argument holds, then the DNS links could be vulnerable to the same takedown notices used to strike torrent links from Google searches. The net effect would be similar to site-blocking, making it as easy to unplug a URL as it is to take down a YouTube video. It would also cast DNS providers as legally responsible for all the sites on the web, the same way YouTube is responsible for every video uploaded to its network. For many providers, simply managing the flood of notices might create a logistical nightmare. The plan could create a kind of DNS black market, exposing users to untold security risks There are still serious technical problems with the approach. Determined users would be able to get around the block by typing the IP address directly into their browsers, or by configuring their computers to use a DNS server that's not affected by the block. Standard circumvention tools like VPNs and Tor will also find it easy to get around the block. But the MPAA’s goal is primarily to deter and marginalize file-sharing, so forcing any would-be pirates to reconfigure their DNS setting might be enough. As one technical analysis notes, ""notwithstanding the availability of these circumvention techniques, it does not appear that the majority of users are employing them to evade blocks of pirate sites."" But even if the result stops short of making a site completely inaccessible, it could still do real damage to the DNS system as it currently functions. The DNS system is already a contentious security issue, sometimes exploited by attackers to hijack websites, and any authentication measures like DNSSEC would quickly run into problems under the MPAA’s new scheme. If users flee standard DNS servers in search of pirate sites, DNS blocks could also create a kind of DNS black market, exposing piracy-seeking users to untold security risks. Mostly, it represents one more time the fundamental architecture of the web has come under fire as part of an anti-piracy scheme. It's still unclear whether the plan would prove technically feasible or whether the legal arguments would survive in court, but the document suggests the MPAA hasn’t backed away from its goal of blocking any site that shares pirated content, and it isn’t afraid to leave systems like DNS as collateral damage. Even worse, while the rest of the web seems to have moved on from SOPA, the MPAA is still using it as a playbook.

The gladiatorial drums of the fighting pits hammered away, as if to say ""another day, another child burned to a crisp,"" but it was hard to get on board when the screams of Shireen Baratheon were still ringing in our ears. Farewell, Princess. We'll throw you a +5 for acquiring a cute carved stag before striking you off the board, and another +10 for fully curing Davos Seaworth's illiteracy before you left. (""Thank you ... for teaching me to be a grown up,"" said Davos, which was objectively the best line of the week. +15) Thank goodness this writeup is just an impartial, cut-and-dry scoring recap, and not some kind of podium for my personal opinions and feelings about television, or we might be here all day! This show is very subversive Just to show how little I care about subjective things like good vs. pitch-black-hopeless-void evil, I'll even go ahead and throw +30 at Ramsay Bolton — who, come on, wasn't even in attendance this week! His resoundingly successful mission with his ""20 good men"" effectively brought Stannis Baratheon and his army to the tough predicament they found themselves in this week. You have to respect the uncompromising world George R.R. Martin has built: unlike your mom's lamestream sword-and-sorcery books, where the heroes predictably always manage to slay the bad guys against impossible odds, in Westeros, the villains always manage to slay the good whatever guys against impossible odds, which is way more realistic and less predictable. This show is very subversive!   Now, some more emotion-driven scorekeepers might be tempted to dock 100 points from Stannis and Melisandre, for, you know, losing any smidgen of audience sympathy or appreciation they may have built up over the past several seasons. But rules are rules, and if it makes them feel any better, those two miserable dummies can split the +35 they earned for killing a drafted character. And hey — who knows? Maybe this will be just the thing the Lord of Light's army needs to get his mojo back. If it's not, or if there are — gods forbid — some kind of terrible repercussions for such an unpleasant decision, then trust me, this will not be the last you hear about this. Here are some points, you miserable dummies Elsewhere, in Dorne, Doran Martell's respectable refusal to kill little girls has been at the source of the GOGOT's only officially sanctioned Lame Plotline, so maybe we shouldn't be so quick to judgement. Let's start off by doing our routine -10 docking of all concerned players (Jaime Lannister, Bronn, Obara Sand, Tyene Sand, and Nymeria Sand), none of whom managed to make any of those points back except Jaime with his new Dornish look (+10). Myrcella Baratheon also switched up her usual Princess Peach togs for something a little more contemporary and appropriate for Dorne's winter festival season (+10).   With Myrcella and Jaime heading back to rotten old King's Landing, and Doran forced to give up his only potential bargaining chip, Trystane Martell is arguably the biggest winner of the little family meeting Doran hosts. Jaime promises him a seat on the small council, which I will award Promotion points for when I see it — I'm with Ellaria Sand; I'm not sure we can trust the word of a Kingslayer for the time being. Ellaria gets in some cutting remarks and dumps a nice red all over Doran's mosaic flooring, but no move was quite so devastating as this low blow: ""No wonder you cannot stand. You have no spine."" (+10) This apparently tested the limits of Doran's cool-mom approach to discipline, and he eventually got her to kiss the ring (+10) while the Sand Snakes looked on helplessly. The bad guy is bad and the brothels are ... there Let's hop back across the pond to Braavos, which I had kind of been partial to as a nice, somewhat more sane alternative to King's Landing. They've got oysters! They've got a cornucopia of nationalities and religious beliefs! And they apparently also have a rich child prostitute economy, at least when Meryn Trant's in town. Not sure what we really accomplished this time around, or if Arya's stalking detour for her own personal vendetta accomplished anything other than further establishing that a bad guy is bad and that brothels are ... there. I do not like where I think this plot is going, and unfortunately Game of Thrones has become predictably gross enough for me to be pretty sure I know where this plot is going. Onward to Meereen!   I will say, even after a rough first half, it was kind of cool to see Daenerys Targaryen presiding over her gladiatorial arena, as much as she loathes her new duty as ceremonial hand-clapper. I liked the tetchy chitter-chatter between her newfound coterie of Daario Naharis (who could not be more obvious about the fact that he's still getting his eggs warmed on the side by the Mother of Dragons), the sputtering entitlement of Hizdahr, and Tyrion Lannister. Specifically, it was fun to see Tyrion interact with the crew, especially Dany's intended, if only for a brief spell (""My father would have liked you,"" Tyrion sighs — +5). Meereen is about to get Sonned! (Of the Harpies!) And then bad old Jorah Mormont saunters out, fueled by love and humiliation and his own impending mortality, like any good warrior. He proceeds to strike down two of his fighting pit assailants (+20), and then gets a bonus kill — a masked man who is about to make an attempt on the life of the queen (+10). Oh shit, Meereen is about to get Sonned! (Of the Harpies!)   For saving her life, Jorah effectively gets his job as back as the Gary to Daenerys' Selina (+25). But he barely has time to take a victory lap, because he's still got to see to the swarm of Harpies that materialize in the arena — you know what that means! It's a bloodbath point party! YOU get +50, Jorah! And YOU get +50, Daario! And YOU get +50, Harpies — as well as +20 for killing off my beloved Hizdahr. Tyrion even picks up +10 for a Harpy kill, and I'm going to give a mere +30 to The Unsullied, because I swear I think I saw them actually kill maybe three bad guys? (Where the actual eff is Grey Worm? Still recuperating? Haven't like five years gone by in Thrones time?) +100 for Dragons (and the Power of Female Friendship) And then when all hope seems lost, Daenerys and her best gal pal Missandei take each other's hands, and through the power of female friendship ... DRAGONS! Well, one dragon, to be accurate, but it does the trick — both of saving the queen and saving this episode from the fighting pits of despair. It's only fair to award both Dany and Drogon +100 each for this feat — like the White Walkers last week, they provided a tentpole moment that will forever be remembered as a peak of the show, even in one of its darker hours. Dance Dragons, Dance.   But we still have lots of unanswered questions. How is Daenerys' crew supposed to get out of that arena after their girl ditched them? Are the Harpies just momentarily disarmed due to the paralyzing power of Dragons (and female friendship!)? Did Hizdahr plan the whole massacre, including his own murder, so as to remove blame? (He suspiciously stepped out at one point to ""make sure everything was in order"" which is a weird way to talk about relieving yourself after an overindulgence in the Pentoshi Pale Amber (yup, still in my tabs).

But standard SMS messaging has a bunch of limitations, such as slow response, file size limitations on picture and video attachments, and no way to tell if your message has been received or read by the other party. Today, T-Mobile announced a new feature for its customers that addresses a number of those limitations while still preserving the ease and ubiquity of standard text messages. T-Mobile's new Advanced Messaging service is built on the Rich Communications Service (RCS) standard and adds near real-time chatting for one on one and group messages; typing indicators and read notifications; and the ability to send photos and videos up to 10MB in size. It doesn't require the use of another app or for either party to sign up for another service. The carrier says that it built the service to work ""across all devices, makers and operating systems, and wireless operators"", though for now, it is the only carrier in the US that supports RCS. These features can work across carriers, but for now, T-Mobile is the only one supporting them Advanced Messaging may work on every device and platform, but existing devices will need software updates to enable it. T-Mobile says those are coming soon for the Samsung Galaxy S5 and S6, with ""nearly a dozen more"" devices coming with it enabled out of the box this year. The new Samsung Galaxy Grand Prime, available starting today, is officially the first device with support for it. The system will fall back to standard SMS or MMS messages when there isn't an Advanced Messaging compatible device in play. A Wi-Fi or LTE connection is also required for the advanced features to work. The new service doesn't cost anything more for T-Mobile customers, and the carrier says that it is just the first of many new features coming that are built on the RCS standard. T-Mobile has often been on the vanguard of new services such as VoLTE and now Advanced Messaging, so it will be interesting to see how the other carriers respond and how long before they do.",0.3887713404063374,0.6112286595936627,0.1952527223477283,392,4.8852040816326534,220,5.709090909090909,1,0,"Mobile, Tech",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

That finally looks to be changing with iOS 9, based on reported changes in the fourth developer beta. Apple has had the good sense to shut down app reviews for anyone using prerelease builds and now displays a message saying ""this feature isn't available"" and that users ""can't write reviews while using a prerelease version of iOS.""

But for three McGill University researchers, it made perfect sense. How else would you find out what behavioral and physiological changes might have taken place when fish first made the move from sea to land over 400 million years ago? ""I used to look at fins and their motion, and I always thought it was so interesting and complex,"" says Emily Standen, lead author of a study published in Nature today, and an evolutionary biomechanics researcher who now works at the University of Ottawa. ""And then I thought, wow, how does that change from a fin to something that might work on land? That’s how this project started.""    To find out exactly what might have happened when aquatic animals first moved to land, Standen and her colleagues took 111 juvenile Polypterus senegalus — a fish species that goes by the common name Senegal bichir, or ""dinosaur eel"" — and raised them for eight months in a terrestrial environment. This environment consisted of mesh flooring covered in pebbles and just 3 millimeters of water — a precaution that, combined with water misters, prevented the fish from drying out. The researchers also formed a control group using 38 fish growing up in their usual aquatic environment. ""There’s anecdotal evidence that they move on land."" ""These fish have functional lungs and can breathe air,"" explains Standen. Dinosaur eels also have gills, but they breathe at the surface regularly to increase their oxygen supply. They also occasionally use their fins to walk on land. ""There’s anecdotal evidence that they move on land from ephemeral pond to ephemeral pond [when they dry up],"" Standen says, ""but they don’t do it voluntarily."" Still, that was more than enough to attempt to raise these young fish on land. ""We used high-speed video to analyze their movements at the end of the eight-month period,"" Standen says. Because of time restraints, this part of the analysis was carried out in 20 of the terrestrial fish and 10 of the aquatic fish. The researchers also killed and scanned individuals from both groups to look at how living on land had affected their skeletons. As it turns out, growing up on land really does change how a fish walks.  Growing up on land really does change how a fish walks ""Fish raised on land walk with a more effective gait,"" Standen says. ""They plant their legs closer to the body’s midline, they lift their heads higher, and they slip less during that walking cycle."" The fish raised on land were also generally more consistent in the way they walked than their aquatic counterparts. But their behavior wasn’t the only thing that changed. For example, ""the bones in the pectoral girdle — the bones that support the fins — changed their shape,"" she says. ""And their clavicles became elongated."" Most changes that occurred were ones that gave their heads and fins more room to move around. ""It’s an important change, because if you think of a terrestrial lifestyle,"" Standen explains, ""you actually need a neck on land because you’re stuck on this plane, and you need to have more head motion that’s independent from the body."" ""they lift their heads higher, and they slip less."" Yet, the experimental nature of this study does limit some conclusions the researchers can draw. For one thing, the dinosaur eel isn’t directly related to the fish species that first walked on land, such as the Eusthenopteron. ""We don’t have a living ancestor of the fish we’re interested in,"" Standen explains. Instead the scientists went with the next best thing: a species that’s physically similar to the fossils from that period. ""It’s a great model because it’s elongate, has armor scales, and has ventral lateral pectoral fins‚ which means its fins are at the side, close to the belly of the fish."" Despite this limitation, Standen says it’s exciting to think that we can use experiments on living animals to make inferences about what might have happened to physically similar animals during large scale evolutionary transitions. ""It seems quite clear that environmentally induced changes may have facilitated their transition to land,"" Standen says. ""Selective pressures then acted on these changes, and they became fixed in the genome over very long periods of time."" Standen is now repeating the experiment with the hope of identifying changes in the fish’s muscles. She would also like to look at what happens when the fish are kept on land for longer periods. ""It’s quite possible that larger changes would occur if we kept them on land for longer,"" she says. ""The big dream is to do this over several generations.""",0.6110268731017674,0.3889731268982326,0.5314383209129842,798,4.981203007518797,415,6.0,1,0,"Science, Report",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

They leave long serpentine trails behind them in the dirt, and for decades visitors have guessed at how they migrate across the desert floor. Hurricane force winds, sliding sheets of ice — and, of course, aliens — were all contenders, but then last December the cousins Richard Norris and James Norris caught the rocks in the act. In a paper published in Plos One, they describe watching a thin layer of ice break into large panes and get pushed by a light wind against the boulders, which then began to slide through the mud at about 15 feet a minute. ""We were sitting on a mountainside and admiring the view when a light wind kicked up and the ice started cracking,"" Richard told the LA Times. ""Suddenly, the whole process unfolded before our eyes.""   Geologists have been studying the sailing stones since 1948, but despite years of research, no one could conclusively say how the rocks moved. That was partly due to the fact that they moved very rarely. Conditions need to be perfect. First there needs to be rain — obviously a rarity in Death Valley — then the temperature needs to drop below freezing, then it has to warm up fast enough to rapidly melt the ice, and then there needs to be wind to break the ice and push it against the stones. Previous attempts at setting up time lapse cameras never caught the rocks in motion. In 2011, the Norrises set up a weather station nearby and affixed GPS devices to 15 rocks. At the time, they ascribed to the hurricane-force wind theory, but in November 2013, a freak storm dumped an inch and a half of rain, which then froze. When they visited the Valley a month later, they saw a light wind crack the ice into large, thin panes and plough the boulders through the mud.

Don't get your hopes up, though — chances are very high that Mississippi will win the contract again. While marijuana is becoming more acceptable at the state level — both Washington and Colorado have legalized it for recreational use, while more than dozen others have decriminalized and / or legalized it for medical use — the federal government still classifies it as a Schedule I drug. That's the most restrictive level and places it alongside heroin, LSD, and ecstasy (""less abusive"" Schedule II drugs include cocaine, OcyContin, and meth). For scientists looking to test marijuana for medical purposes, that leaves you with one grower with finite resources and questionable potency. In 2007, the University of Massachusetts Amherst lobbied to become a second source of research pot but was ultimately denied by the Drug Enforcement Agency's top administrator Michele Leonhart, who still holds onto the job. So the concerns go beyond who ultimately wins this contract (spoiler: it's Mississippi), but let's stay you're still determined to apply. According to a posting on Federal Business Opportunities, NIDA is looking for new pot farmers to ""cultivate and harvest, process, analyze, store, and distribute cannabis (marijuana) for research."" The list of requirements are fairly specific (an indoor facility that's at least 1,000 square feet with several means of monitoring, a maintained inventory of around 400kg and 700 kg of marijuana in various forms) and the grower will need to apply and earn approval from multiple governmental bodies including both the Food and Drug Administration and the Drug Enforcement Administration. NIDA is looking to grant a one-year contract (with four one-year extension offers).

The array of microphones, geophones, and barometric gauges will run for a year, taping everything from the songs of birds arriving in the spring to the vibrations of the continent as ocean waves pound the Atlantic and Pacific coasts. They will measure earthquakes on the other side of the world and the stomping of cattle nearby, the ultrasonic whistles of bats and the barometric drop of cold fronts. “I joke to my physicist friends that if I had a microphone small enough, I could record the Higgs boson,” Pijanowski says.   Pijanowski is a soundscape ecologist, a term he coined three years ago to describe a new approach to studying sound. Rather than look at how, for example, a single species of frog calls for a mate, soundscape ecologists study how all the sounds in a space interact, from frog calls to car traffic to thunder. ""There are what I call rhythms of nature, there are periodicities like the dawn chorus and certain crescendos during the seasons,"" Pijanowski says, referring to the way birds burst into song at sunrise. He believes listening to these patterns can tell us important things about the state of the natural world. Though still small, the field is growing, thanks in no small measure to Pijanowski’s tireless efforts (and those of his grad students). For the last several years he’s been circling the globe, depositing microphones in Costa Rica, Borneo, Tippecanoe, the Sonoran desert, Alabama, the wildfire-ravaged Chiricahuas, and urban parks in Chicago, often giving talks along the way. You get the sense he’s slightly reserved except when talking about sound, at which point he gestures expansively and uses words like ""marvelous,"" ""magnificent,"" and ""glorious."" Earlier this year, Pijanowski launched the Global Soundscapes Project, which is building a map of the world's sounds using an app that turns phones into recorders. Occasionally he has an IMAX crew in tow, part of a soundscape education program he’s filming. And every few months he convenes soundscape researchers for workshops, part of a grant from the National Science Foundation. He invites people from outside the sciences to participate. ""When you look at arrangements of sound, working with musicians helps you to think about the orchestration of an ecosystem,"" he explains. The idea that animal sounds follow a complex order goes back to Bernie Krause, a musician who in the 1960s and ’70s made a living doing sound work for the film industry, frequently taping things like jungle noises and whale songs. He became enamored of nature sounds and started accompanying researchers into the field to make recordings, eventually becoming the preeminent wildlife acoustician. In 1985, he was called on to lure a confused humpback whale, Humphrey, out of the Sacramento river using a feeding song. As he sat in jungles and deserts around the world, Krause noticed that the sounds he heard could be surprisingly orderly. Different species seemed to occupy their own place in the sonic spectrum. Insects in Borneo might stridulate loudly at a middle frequency, alternating so as not to drown each other out. Birds rise above it by calling at a higher pitch, and birds with shorter calls fit in-between the calls of birds with longer ones. Frogs puncture the droning insect noise with short, loud bursts, and mammals take the bottom frequencies. Organisms, Krause hypothesized, evolved to partition acoustic bandwidth, calling out at different frequencies and at different intervals to be heard over one another. Animals would also have to evolve to be heard over sounds like thunder, wind, and rushing rivers — sounds that Krause, working with ecologist Stuart Gage, called geophony. And in more recent history, animals must also adjust to anthrophony: the sounds of human civilization. Krause called his idea the acoustic niche hypothesis, and it had a corollary. If organisms evolved to share the acoustic spectrum, maybe disruptions from pollution, development, invasive species, and other threats would result in gaps in the arrangement of sounds. In 1989, Krause found what he believes is evidence of such audible damage. The year before, he had taken a recording of a forest in the Sierra Nevadas. He returned after it had been selectively logged and found the soundscape almost silent.   The idea that you can hear environmental damage is evocative — Rachel Carson knew that when she chose the title Silent Spring — but as powerful as Krause’s Sierra Nevada recording is, there are other potential explanations. It could have been a La Nina year, Pijanowski says, causing the birds showed up later. There could have been landscape changes elsewhere on their migratory route. There was no control group, no uncut forest in the same area to measure against. In the last several years, researchers armed with microphones and data-sifting algorithms have been trying to explore and build on Krause’s ideas. They’re using microphones to monitor biodiversity in Costa Rica and Australia, and a similar network is being established in Germany. Other researchers have diagnosed dying coral reefs by the sound, as various fish and crustaceans go silent. Pijanowski believes he’ll be able to hear shifts in the soundscape as the climate changes. Insects, whose life cycles are driven by temperature changes, will emerge earlier, while birds and mammals, whose behavior is driven primarily by the length of the day, will remain the same. Amphibians are driven by both factors, so it’s unclear how they’ll respond. New species will invade warming regions, potentially adding their own calls or silencing those of native animals. ""We will start to hear a reassembly of the soundscape as summer comes earlier,"" Pijanowski says. Pijanowski is responsible for much of the field’s recent growth, both by giving a name to what disparate researchers were doing, and by convening many of those researchers in workshops. The last one was held in Maine — fittingly, near the Rachel Carson Wildlife Preserve — and drew a group of ecologists, biologists, musicians, engineers, artists, and philosophers. ""It’s still in its renaissance period,"" explained Tom Seager, an ecologist from Arizona attending the workshop. ""Where both technologists and artists can contribute."" As a fledgling field, there was a lot of debate over terms and concepts, discussions that frequently ended up in philosophical territory. One such debate was over what to call noises that humans make. ""I no longer like the term anthrophony,"" Stuart Gage said as he walked through the forest listening to birds. A gray-bearded, soft-spoken former entomologist-turned-soundscape ecologist, Gage has a measured way of speaking and a saintly determination to neither use insect repellent nor to swat the swarms of mosquitoes battening onto him. If Krause is the godfather of soundscape ecology and Pijanowski its current evangelist, Gage is the bridge. He helped Krause come up with the taxonomy of sound in the early 2000s and advised Pijanowski on his thesis. ""I’ve argued with Bernie a number of times that we ought to use the term technophony to distinguish sounds humans make from technological sounds — because humans are critters too, we communicate in the same way, with our voices. But we also make things."" Jeff Migliozzi, a teacher at the Perkins School for the Blind, agreed. ""You’re essentially redefining man, saying instead of being a biological creature, we’re creators of technology, and the rattle and the hum."" ""Maybe that’s true,"" said Gage. Out on the estuary, Pijanowski was checking a recorder he’d set up in May. It had captured the pounding surf, shrieking gulls, sparrows, crickets, and hawks. The tides set the rhythm: high tide was silent and low tide cacophonous, as the birds swooped down to devour animals trapped in the tide pools. There was a rhythm to the technophony too, a dawn chorus of diesel engines as fishermen moved up and down the coast, weekly influxes of jets and speedboats, heavier on the weekends and increasing into summer. The issue of mechanical noise was a major theme of the workshop, and of soundscape ecology in general. Falk Huettmann from the University of Alaska Fairbanks projected a noise map of the Kenai Wildlife Refuge made by his graduate student Tim Mullett. Mullett had traveled deep into the glacial refuge to set up microphones, going high into the mountains dozens of miles from the nearest road. He still found mechanical noise everywhere, mostly from airplanes and snowmobiles. Speaking grimly in a German accent, Huettmann declared, ""We need to abandon the idea of wilderness. It doesn’t exist."" Mechanical noise impacts different animals in different ways. In some cases — sonar and marine mammals, to name one — it’s disorienting and damaging. In others, animals adapt in ways we’re just beginning to understand. Grasshoppers that live near roads evolve to call at a higher pitch, to be heard over traffic noise. Even when taken to a silent room in a lab, they stridulate at a higher frequency than more rural grasshoppers, which makes sense — only grasshoppers that can be heard above the cars would find a mate. There seems to be variation in how birds respond to noise. In 2003, researchers found that great tits (a bird) living in loud parts of the Dutch city of Leiden called at a higher pitch than tits in quiet parts. Urban robbins, meanwhile, appear to call at night not because they’re confused by city lights, as previously thought, but because they want to avoid the noisy day. Another researcher found that responses to noise varied depending on the species: one bird, the gray flycatcher, fled areas where gas drillers were using noisy air compressors, while ash-throated flycatchers simply called at a higher frequency. Sharon Gill, a biologist at Western Michigan University who was at the workshop, is studying how individual chipping sparrows respond to noise. Her initial findings indicate that there’s great variation in how individuals react, with sparrows with deeper calls raising their pitch more drastically to be heard over the sound of traffic. ""I’m really interested in the persistence of species in a changing world,"" Gill says. ""This isn’t the environment these animals evolved in, with these high levels of noise."" Soundscape ecology’s current challenge is finding a way to sort through the vast amounts of data being collected. In just a few years, Pijanowski’s lab has accrued tens of thousands of hours of audio. There’s no way anyone could listen to all this audio, so algorithms need to sort through it. Current methods are somewhat crude. Gage’s index takes everything at a frequency below 2 kilohertz and labels it human, then quantifies the acoustic energy in the ranges above that. It’s roughly accurate, but certain animals, like the loon, call at a low frequency. Another method sorts sound by its shape on a spectrogram. Animal sounds are generally short and sharply peaking, whereas machines tend to drone at a constant level. Again, though, it’s not always true — think of crickets in the summer, or the aquatic bang of the air guns used in undersea oil and gas exploration. Machine learning could help correct these issues, though that research is just beginning. Computer scientist Michael Towsey in Brisbane, Australia, is taking a visual approach, using multiple indices to create color-coded images of soundscapes. The idea is that a trained ecologist could look at the charts of sound over the course of a day, month, or year and identify changes, like an acoustic weather map. The hope is that an algorithm with the right index will parse the audio ecologists are collecting, turning low-cost microphones into a powerful network of sensors. With a way to quickly digest audio, researchers would have a vast array of data on what species are where and when, data that over time could provide a valuable glimpse into the way the environment is changing. ""I looked for most of my scientific career for an instrument that would measure the environment,"" Gage says. ""I use the analogy of a stethoscope. A doctor can use a stethoscope to tell 10 different things about your heart. We’re holding a stethoscope up to nature. We’re listening to the heartbeat of the environment, whether it’s the heartbeat of a city or the heartbeat of a forest, it’s the heartbeat of the biosphere.""

It’s a slightly unsettling idea, but it’s also one that physicists have been thinking about for some time. Unfortunately, until recently, a 2D universe wasn’t something we could verify. Now, thanks to an experiment recently launched at Fermi National Laboratory in Illinois, we might finally be able to determine how the universe stores the information we interact with everyday — and whether we’re living in a hologram. ""For thousands of years we have assumed that space is made of points and lines,"" said Craig Hogan, director of Fermilab’s Center for Particle Astrophysics, in an email to The Verge. But ""maybe that is not right — it might be made of waves, the way that matter and energy are."" ""Ultimately, it will be a fundamental limit on what we can ever measure, think or do."" To determine if the universe is actually two dimensional, physicists have set up an experiment called the holometer. It consists of two high-intensity laser beams — beams that are roughly equivalent to 200,000 laser pointers — that are split using a beam splitter, and sent perpendicularly down two 40 meter arms. Then, at the end of the arms, the beams are reflected back to the splitter, where they’re recombined. The idea here is that when the beams hit the splitter a second time, the beam splitter might move in a certain way, and cause the beams’ brightness to fluctuate. If that happens, it would mean that space is continually vibrating, sort of like a wave — a 2D wave, to be exact — and the spitter is being carried along space’s constant jitter. Such a result could fundamentally alter our perception of the world, because it would mean that information about our universe is stored on tiny two dimensional particles, ones that are about 10 trillion times smaller than an atom. ""If you think about reality as a giant computer, that's all there is. The total information [it can contain] is finite,"" Hogan said. ""Ultimately, it will be a fundamental limit on what we can ever measure, think or do.""   If we do live in a 2D world, there’s no telling how that might affect human life. ""Einstein's theory of space-time is now coded into everyone's smart phone, but that took almost 100 years,"" Hogan said. So for now, the researchers prefer to focus on the task at hand: analysing fluctuations in returning light. Altering how humans understand the universe will come later, if at all.

We’ve traveled across the country to find the people, groups, and companies that are solving America’s problems in new and unconventional ways. At MIT Media Lab in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Caleb Harper’s CityFARM demonstrates the future of food production. He grows plants through aeroponics, a system that produces plants without soil. Plants are hooked up to servers and misting mechanisms. LEDs fill in for the sun and ladybugs (purchased on Amazon) occasionally make an appearance. Plants are periodically sprayed with a nutrient-rich mist that provides optimal pH balance. Light and temperatures are closely monitored. The environment nurtures plants that have twice the nutrient density of their conventional counterparts. Lettuce, bok choy, and tomatoes have already fed the scientists in the lab. Farming consumes about 80 percent of the available freshwater in the US. Produce largely relies on natural conditions that are increasingly unpredictable. Transportation between the points of production and consumption, in particular, impacts cost and quality of food. Aeroponics reduces agricultural water consumption by 98 percent and eliminates the use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides. But, it is not a replacement for agriculture. ""There’s a lot of us versus them in this field right now, which is highly unproductive,"" he says. ""It’s all one system. Some things make more sense in a bigger environment — commodities like wheat, soy, rice, corn."" Those volumes are not on Harper’s agenda. ""But, what about the things that don’t work well in traditional systems?"" The system can aid existing farmers and make yields higher. But, it also wants to cater to a new farmer, the kind that lives in the city. ""How do we take a horizontal greenhouse and make it vertical?"" Using less square footage for the most amount of production will be the requisite for feeding cramped cities of the future. ""What I’m thinking is how do we take a horizontal greenhouse and make it vertical?"" said Harper. Research and technology that has the potential to affect global change is often closely guarded until a venture capitalist comes along. But, Harper’s work is open source. ""I’m building the operating system that these environments will function on,"" he said. ""So like a plant OS — but more towards a platform for developers to be able to add on to over time."" Despite the scale of potential benefits, detractors believe the energy equation is going to prevent this New Age farm from becoming a reality. ""It’s true right now,"" said Harper.

Investors include a roster of big names including Google Ventures, BP, General Electric, and ConocoPhillips. Last month the company broke ground on its first commercial plant, located in Louisiana, and this new capital will go towards completing that infrastructure and building two more Louisiana facilities. Cool Planet argues that its process takes more CO2 out of the atmosphere than it adds in Like many biofuels companies before it, Cool Planet makes liquid fuel from plant matter, mostly leftover agricultural waste like corn cobs and sugar canes. Its insight was that during this process it could also create biochar, a substance that comes from burning plants under extreme heat and pressure with little to no oxygen. The biochar prevents carbon dioxide from escaping as the plants decay and can be spread on farmland, helping the soil retain water and nutrients, boosting crop yields. Because the biochar keeps carbon in the ground for years, even centuries, Cool Planet argues that its process takes more CO2 out of the atmosphere than it adds in. Cool Planet's huge funding round comes amidst a series of setbacks for the biofuels industry. A recent 60 Minutes episode focused on the struggles of these companies, many of which have lost 75 percent or more of their value since going public. The result has been billions in losses for venture capital firms and, 60 Minutes argues, the taxpayers who helped subsidize them. ""We have learned a lot from the mistakes made by our predecessors."" ""We have learned a lot from the mistakes made by our predecessors and are taking a fresh approach,"" says Howard Janzen, Cool Planet's CEO. Rather than building large facilities that produce hundreds of million of gallons of fuel per year, Cool Planet is creating small modular facilities that can be built near the site of the feedstock. ""If you don't have to transport the biomass a long way to the facility, you can really cut both costs and your carbon footprint."" The company is also being careful not to rely on any plants that double as food sources: for instance, corn, which can be used to create ethanol and saw a number of volatile price spikes in recent years. It's also trying to diversify its revenue streams, selling its product as a blend to be mixed in with traditional gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel. It sells the biochar to farmers and is looking at using it for cleaning chemicals out of polluted water as well. Finally, the company is planning to sell carbon credits. ""The fossil fuel companies know they will be obligated to obtain these renewable fuel credits,"" says Janzen. ""So we are a technology that helps their current business last longer."" In exchange Cool Planet gets customers and can rely on the infrastructure that companies like BP and ConocoPhillips have already put in place. The science — which worked so well in the lab and pilot facility — will now have to perform at scale The next two years will reveal a lot about Cool Planet, which says it expects its first Louisiana plant to be producing 10 million gallons of fuel annually by the end of 2015. The science — which worked so well in the lab and pilot facility — will now have to perform at scale. ""Cool Planet is tackling some of the most important environmental issues of our time, and the company's success could change the way the world approaches sustainable energy,"" said Bill Maris, Google Ventures’ managing partner.

The final number, a $250 million investment, puts it exactly on par with its biggest competitor, Uber, which raised the same amount from Google Ventures back in August of 2013. Lyft says it has expanded from just one city at the start of last year to 30 sites across America today. The new cash will be used to fuel more growth stateside and also help Lyft begin to push into international markets. There are a few critical differences between Lyft and its competitors, according to the company's founder and president, John Zimmer. ""Uber hires professional limo and taxi drivers and sets up offices in each market they enter."" By comparison, he says, Lyft has little overhead. ""We are a purely peer-to-peer service. It's a software platform that is used by a community of drivers and riders looking to connect."" Zimmer insists that while its drivers come from the ranks of average citizens, Lyft's safety standards mean the service is less risky than your average taxi or black car. ""We run criminal background and driving record checks on all our drivers, something that is not even required by taxi commissions in a lot of big cities."" Zimmer says Lyft also provides more than $1 million in commercial insurance for all its drivers, an issue that sparked controversy after an UberX driver struck and killed a young girl in San Francisco earlier this year. Lyft began as a sort of hi-tech ride-sharing board, akin to the ones you might find in the campus center of a college. In some cities there was no standard fare, and riders simply gave drivers a tip at the end equal to what they thought was fair. Zimmer says that as Lyft has grown it has moved away from this model and will soon have a single standard set of fares, which will be the same for all drivers across all cities. The fares are split 80–20 between drivers and Lyft. Like Uber, the company uses a dynamic pricing model based on demand, although Lyft says its model doesn't just increase fares during high demand, but also offers customers discounts during periods of low usage.",0.5143427603295856,0.4856572396704144,0.8887612709107017,393,4.7353689567430024,250,5.508,0,0,"Business, Report",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

This is a common practice for companies whose shares have reached and sustained an expensive all-time high. Google's stock price had topped $1,000 in recent months — by splitting its stock Google makes it cheaper and more attractive to small retail investors. It also gives itself more shares, which are an essential tool for hiring top talent and completing big mergers and acquisitions. The unusual thing about today's split was that it didn't simply double the number of existing shares; it also splits them into multiple types. It created a new kind of shares, Class C stock, which will trade under a different ticker symbol and won't have any of the voting rights associated with the existing Class A stock that has long been available on the public markets.  Critics would call it another example of the company flouting its ""don't be evil"" motto The move is intended to allow the current executives to retain firm control over the company. Critics say that Google's approach undermines the rights of shareholders, just another example of the company flouting its ""don't be evil"" motto. If the new Class C shares were the only ones available to the public, then this argument would hold water. But it's not the whole story. Firstly, Google has always had a multitiered system of shares. Before today there were the Class A shares available to the public along with the Class B shares, which had 10 times the voting rights and are largely controlled by top executives like Larry Page, Sergey Brin, and Eric Schmidt, effectively giving them control of over 61 percent of the votes. Second, investors can still continue to purchase Class A shares if they want to have a say during Google's shareholder votes. The Class A and C shares will trade under different tickers, GOOGL and GOOG. In theory they are supposed to have the same price. But since the C shares have no voting rights, they may be cheaper. If there is a big spread, Google has agreed to pay up to $7.5 billion to investors to help cover the difference. A move to protect against activist investors So investors will have a choice: buy the likely more expensive Class A shares with voting rights, or stick with the Class C shares, which don't give a vote, but still present investors with a chance to profit from Google's success in the future. For the majority of investors voting is a non-issue, since they will never have a large enough stake to make any meaningful impact. And that's really the rub. This class of non-voting shares is intended to keep big players like activist investor Carl Icahn from coming in and buying up a big stake in Google now that the shares are cheaper, then trying to make demands about how the company should be run. It's got nothing to do with punishing the little guy. Time will tell how the two classes of shares perform against one another. For small investors, the Class C shares could end up being a great bargain: you can essentially buy a stake in Google's future performance at a discount, giving up voting rights that are largely symbolic. And if the gap in price grows too large between your shares and the Class A stock, Google has promised it will literally pay to make up the difference.",0.44937830396213385,0.5506216960378661,0.1955050482690914,599,4.7579298831385639,299,5.615384615384615,0,0,"Business, Google, Tech, Report",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

The two women had met at their kids’ kindergarten, but supervising the playground is how they got to know each other. As Danielson, a Harvard geochemist, and Chase, an MIT business school graduate turned stay-at-home mom, kept chatting, their casual park encounters grew more profound. Chase started telling Danielson about wanting to put her business degree to good use, about her entrepreneurial ambitions. Danielson spoke of wanting to branch out of academia, a desire that had her, too, mulling entrepreneurship. “I was sitting in the playground after school, and there was this other mom who had a business degree and I was telling her about [wanting to start a business],” Danielson recalls. “She said, ‘Oh, that’s really interesting, and I’ve been thinking of starting a company, too.’” Danielson’s husband was encouraging. “He said, ‘Well, why don’t you just ask her if she wants to start this company with you?’”   So, one afternoon in October of 1999, Danielson took a chance and told Chase about her car-sharing idea. Chase was enthusiastic, but she wanted to make sure her husband would be okay with her taking on such a big project. That night she went home, talked to him, and decided to go ahead. Within a few days Chase and Danielson had their first official Zipcar business meeting.  Today, Zipcar — which is still headquartered in Boston — has offices in more than 26 American cities and 860,000 members across the US, Austria, Canada, Spain, and the UK. And the company’s profile only grew when car-rental giant Avis bought Zipcar for $491 million in January 2013. But in fact, both founders left the company more than 10 years ago, as power struggles and disputes prevented both Chase and Danielson from seeing their shared vision through. Now 56, Danielson hasn’t spoken to Chase in more than a decade.    Born in Germany, Danielson first came to the US to complete a postdoc in geochemistry at Harvard University, where she studied the chemical composition of the atmosphere using 2.5-million-year-old sedimentary rocks. But after the birth of her first child in 1993, Danielson found herself worrying about the world her son would inherit. ""It was very clear to me how big the [environmental] problems were,"" she says, ""and what I saw [in academia] was a lot of theory, but no application."" She wanted to change her focus from the Earth’s past to its present, and to start a company with an environmental focus. Unsure of what that might actually be, Danielson looked for ideas somewhere familiar: academic journals. It was during her research that a study involving Switzerland’s Mobility Cooperative caught her eye. The European car-sharing company was different from those already operating in the US, like Car Sharing Portland (which later became Flexcar and merged with Zipcar in 2007). Mobility was already a large company, with 17,400 customers and over 700 vehicles. But its biggest asset was technology. The company had developed systems that allowed members to access cars without constant key-swapping. Danielson decided the same thing could succeed in the US. Conscious consumers, both she and Chase agreed on wanting to drastically reduce reliance on single-owner cars, and thought that a company founded on that principle could be a lucrative one given America’s growing interest in environmentalism. But because Danielson’s family relied solely on her income, she needed to keep her job at Harvard. Chase, however, was able to work full time on the new business and threw herself into the company. By the end of 1999, the women were shopping for investors, and secured $75,000 in startup financing before incorporating the company the following January. Chase became Zipcar’s president, while Danielson took on the role of vice president. Zipcar had its first vehicle on the road by May of 2000, and counted over 600 customers by September. But as the company came together, its co-founders grew apart. ""Robin and I didn’t get along very well,"" Danielson says. ""She wanted extra shares, and I said, ‘Look, you can get extra shares through employee stock options, but we started this together [so] we are going to have it 50 / 50.’"" According to Danielson, that push for more assets, and more power, was their primary source of conflict. The rift continued to deepen, and Danielson says she was rarely consulted on decisions, even though the company’s core was composed of only a handful of people at the time. ""It looked like Antje was not being brought into the discussions,"" says Paul Covell, a product manager at Google who was Zipcar’s first engineer. ""There were more conversations happening without her than with her."" Roy Russell, Chase’s husband and Zipcar’s founding technology officer until 2006, says that happened because Danielson wasn’t fully committed to the company. ""She never took on a real strong operational role at the company, that I can remember,"" he says. ""In some sense, I am not sure she ever joined [the company], in the sense that she never left her other job at Harvard."" But Danielson doesn’t see things that way. ""I worked very hard,"" she says. ""I did work my regular hours at Harvard — my 35 hours a week — and then I worked an additional 30 hours or so per week doing Zipcar."" According to the majority of Zipcar staff interviewed for this story, Danielson’s strengths didn’t work in her favor. She was an astute academic and a passionate environmentalist, but one without a shred of business experience. ""Antje brought a more earthy, holistic view to the company,"" says Mark Chase, Robin’s brother and the director of business development at Zipcar for four years. Larry Slotnick, a former fleet manager at Zipcar who oversaw large groups of vehicles, puts it more bluntly: ""It wasn’t like she was doing any irreplaceable task."" Slotnick recalls Danielson as easy to work with, but says she had trouble balancing professional and personal duties. ""She just wasn’t one of these co-founders who was able to put in 50 or 60 hours a week,"" he says. But Covell says that Danielson focused on Zipcar even after the birth of her second son in 2000. ""Antje remains somewhat unique in my experience because when she had her second child, she didn’t miss a beat at the office at all."" Danielson herself remembers going out at midnight to jump-start a Zipcar with a dead battery, ""and I did that with my infant in the car seat."" Though the rift between the two founders was obvious, its extent was unclear until early January of 2001.  During a board meeting, Chase petitioned Zipcar’s board for the ability to make hiring and firing decisions without consulting them. Danielson thought it was a reasonable request that would make things easier as the company expanded, so she voted for the proposition, which passed. ""Two hours later, she was firing me,"" Danielson says. ""Robin wanted to be the sole powerhouse in the company, and she was very savvy at getting the power."" Covell says he didn’t see it coming. Even Chase’s brother was surprised. ""All I know was that Robin initiated it with the board, and that it was some kind of power struggle,"" Mark says. ""I was shocked when it happened."" Only weeks earlier, Danielson had given her notice at Harvard to work full-time for Zipcar. The impending end of her career in academia made the initial shock of her firing at Zipcar all the more devastating. ""I had the idea, I started it, and I asked Robin to partake,"" she says. ""It was almost as though a baby had been taken away from me."" Chase has often stated in interviews that Danielson decided to leave Zipcar on her own. But the former Zipcar CEO now says that she avoided expanding on Danielson’s departure because of a deal the founders struck following the boardroom incident. ""I have spent the last 14 years honoring the agreement I made with Antje when she left the company,"" she wrote in an email. ""This includes not disclosing these details."" When presented with Danielson’s account of the firing, Chase called it ""fascinating."" The board meeting, she wrote, made clear that the board's responsibility was to never meddle with the operations of the company. ""I definitely did not ask the board if I could have the right to fire people in order to fire her,"" she said. ""I have worked very hard to protect Antje over the years, whether or not she appreciates that."" Danielson left Zipcar quietly, taking a job at Harvard’s Green Campus Initiative. She has never spoken publicly about the circumstances surrounding her departure. ""I didn’t make a fuss because Zipcar was still in a very vulnerable state,"" Danielson says, ""and I didn’t want to run it into the ground."" Danielson owned shares in the company, but asserts that a potentially lucrative payoff wasn’t what kept her from speaking up. ""You don’t kill something just because someone else isn’t taking their ethics classes."" After the firing, however, the company dynamics were largely unchanged, Slotnick says. ""It’s not like we dwelt on it for a long time,"" he recalls. ""I don’t think it had too much of an impact."" The company kept expanding, extending its reach to New York City and Washington, DC, within the next two years. But Covell recalls the immediate aftermath of Antje’s departure as sorrowful  rather than business as usual: ""I remember it being a pretty dark situation."" Danielson remained a Zipcar shareholder until Avis bought the company in early 2013. ""I started off with 50 percent of the company,"" she says. But after multiple rounds of funding, she ended up with 1.3 percent — about $6.3 million in an acquisition worth $491 million. Two years after Danielson's firing, Chase was no longer at Zipcar. In the past, Chase has claimed she left Zipcar because of her father’s recent death and her daughter’s budding modeling career (her daughter is Victoria’s Secret model Cameron Russell). And when The Verge asked if she was fired, Chase answered that it was ""a very complicated and long story,"" and she was ""not interested in engaging."" Some within the company simply say, much like Danielson, that she was forced out. ""It was the board’s decision,"" Slotnick says. ""Robin was trying to bring some venture capital — the next infusion of money — and she was having a hard time doing it."" According to him, this was one of Chase’s first efforts to raise millions of dollars on her own, and the people she approached could tell. ""She was the one responsible for bringing in the dough, and she didn’t make it happen."" Based on that, he says, the company’s board decided they wanted a different CEO. Chase was a charismatic leader, says former Zipcar engineer Greg McGuire, but she had a hard time infiltrating the boy’s club that governs the venture capital world. ""It’s almost exclusively males,"" he says, ""and it’s difficult to break into that."" When Chase’s successor Scott Griffith took over, the funding immediately started coming in. ""It kind of seemed to me like the VPs involved were withholding closing on that round [of funding] until they were able to execute the changes they wanted,"" McGuire says. ""My feeling was that Robin was never given a chance — they just orchestrated a take-over and that was that."" Much like her founding partner’s stake, Chase’s ownership share of Zipcar diminished substantially as the company grew. By the time Avis acquired Zipcar, two years after the company’s initial public offering, Chase’s stake had dwindled from over 30 percent to less than three. As the two women predicted over 14 years ago, Zipcar has drastically altered the way we use cars. Families with Zipcar memberships don’t typically own two vehicles: they book one when they need an extra ride instead. And members in big cities rely on the company when they’re running errands or moving from one apartment to the next.  The company currently has over 800 employees and 10,000 vehicles globally. Neither woman worked for Zipcar when it reached this level of popularity. Today, Chase is the executive chairman and founder of Veniam Works, a vehicle-communications company headquartered in Portugal, as well as the founder of French peer-to-peer car-rental company Buzzcar. Since leaving Zipcar, she has been named one of Time’s 100 most influential people (in 2009) and given numerous talks on entrepreneurialism, environmentalism, and the genesis of Zipcar, including a TED talk in 2007. The vast majority of those talks make no mention of her business partner’s contributions —  a circumstance that likely contributed to Danielson being referred to as ""a friend who had just returned from Berlin"" in a 2013 New York Times article. Danielson has long since returned to academia. As the administrative director of the Institute of the Environment at Tufts University, she oversees the day-to-day activities of Tufts’ environmental programs. Sitting in her office, Danielson appears confident and content. As she recounts how her relationship with Chase turned sour, her candidness is a result of both. She no longer bottles her anger, nor does she bite her tongue. Life hasn't been easy of late — she is currently going through a divorce — but the blows she has been dealt haven't slowed her down or made her any more guarded. She even admits to using Zipcar on occasion, saying she continues to feel proud of the company she co-founded. ""I don’t know where Zipcar will go with Avis,"" Danielson says. ""But I feel like we made a difference."" When asked about her future plans, she muses about improving environmental education in colleges around the globe. This idea, she says, may or may not involve a startup. Photography by M.

This strategy is alive and well. Amazon is in the hits business. The company never reveals specific sales numbers for its Kindle and Kindle Fire products except in words like ""best-selling,"" but Amazon sells tablets and ebook readers in the millions. Starting today, it probably has a third hit on its hands: the Fire TV, its new media streamer. And that’s no accident. At $99, Amazon’s new set-top box will compete with devices like Apple TV, Roku, and Google’s Chromecast to be the gadget consumers use while cuddled up on the couch in front of their big flat screen. On one hand it’s an obvious move: Amazon has thrust huge resources behind its streaming-video service, which is of course the primary method of consumption on the Fire TV, and the company has always said that it makes money not when you buy a device, but when you use it (to buy things from Amazon). Of course, lots of tech companies want to be the one selling you movies, songs, and TV shows. But Amazon has a huge advantage. Even as it presented the new device inside a faux living room in New York City, Amazon made clear why it’s building the Fire TV: it’s seen that everyone wants to buy a set-top box, it knows not everyone is happy with the one they bought, and it has plentiful data on exactly why. There lies opportunity.    Amazon knows both what people buy and how they feel about it Amazon doesn’t innovate by crafting new product categories, like Apple does. It also doesn’t make much money selling its hardware. Instead, it takes all the data it gathers as the world’s biggest online retailer, breaks down exactly what’s available and what consumers want, then produces a piece of hardware that it can sell cheaply in order to bring consumers into its ecosystem. Just as Netflix created House of Cards to satisfy the particular tastes of its viewers, Amazon made the Fire TV because millions of buyers are already looking for it. To understand the Fire TV is to take one glance at Amazon’s best-selling electronics list: two Roku models, Google’s Chromecast, and the Apple TV are the only non-Amazon devices in the top 10. The world’s largest online retailer just took on all three. If the device gets to scale (it’s already no. 1 on the best-seller list), Amazon will make money by using the Fire TV to sell everything else. That’s how it’s always done things. ""We have a philosophy that we try to price our devices as close to break-even as we possibly can,"" says Kindle VP Dave Limp. ""If they put it in a drawer, we’ve not benefited at all."" Once the consumer has a Fire TV in their living room, he says, ""somebody might buy à la carte content, movies, TV shows. Somebody might sign up for Prime... we want to be really aligned with the customer that we only make money when they use our products, not when they buy them."" All three of Amazon’s hardware product categories follow this strategy, particularly its tablets. Amazon enters a growing but immature market, sells good devices essentially at cost, markets them aggressively across its site (especially on the all-powerful homepage), and reaps the benefit when customers use them to buy other things from Amazon. With the Fire TV, which puts the Prime Video experience front and center as no Kindle device ever has, it's potentially a more lucrative idea than ever.   This sort of inside-out production isn’t without precedent. Years ago, before Samsung was a household name in consumer electronics, it was a key manufacturer of the internals for smartphones and tablets. The Korean titan learned the business from the inside out, and mastered the supply chain in an effort to make phones cheaper and more efficiently. Amazon’s experience is equally useful: it studies people’s shopping and usage habits, and gives buyers both space and incentive to report what they like and dislike. Its focus group is the entire industry, and it collects data before ever building a prototype. Amazon’s customer reviews said the Roku was slow; the Fire TV is fast. Customers complained about searching with a remote; the Fire TV’s flagship feature is the ability to find things to watch using your voice. Amazon doesn’t have to guess what people want, it just has to wait for others to get it wrong. Amazon doesn’t have to guess what people want, it just has to wait for others to get it wrong Limp says that Amazon’s been watching the set-top box market for a while, and that the company’s involvement started by identifying the problem. ""We talked about the playing field, and one of the filters we use internally is ‘Do we want to use the boxes that are there?’ And then we went out and talked to customers as well, and they were frustrated."" Putting the pieces together from there was easy. ""We had the product in the labs for a long time, but as we started — as those dominoes started falling, as we started solving each one of those problems, I’d say about 18 months ago or so, we started feeling like we had a product. When you put it in your own house — and at this time they were still early versions of this — we just went ‘gosh, I want that.’"" There was a checklist for success, and Amazon followed it to the letter. And if the Fire TV isn’t what you want? Well, Amazon will happily keep selling you a Chromecast or Roku. Or a PlayStation or Xbox, for that matter. ""We think [the Fire TV] is the best one out there,"" Limp says. ""But that doesn’t mean people won’t buy other ones. There are other ones at different price points, there’s lots of selection, and we’ll see."" And the best thing about being Amazon is that no matter how it shakes out, no matter which one you buy, Amazon wins.

Uber has a remarkably rich history of upsetting local city transportation officials by setting up shop before laws and regulations have been ironed out. And that's just what's happening tonight in Portland, Oregon where Uber apparently surprised everyone by launching its ridesharing service without the approval of the city's transportation bureau. The presiding judge of Berlin's administrative court has overturned a ban on Uber put in place by the Berlin State Department of Civil and Regulatory affairs four days ago. That ban shut down Uber citing safety concerns. Uber can now operate legally, although it seems likely that the legal wrangling is far from over.

This isn't the first time Uber has been in legal hot water over its gratuities policy. Drivers in Massachusetts and Chicago filed similar complaints against Uber earlier this year. This... Uber's low-cost taxi service is facing stiff opposition in Washington, DC, thanks to new regulations that forbid some fuel-efficient cars from operating as sedans. The company launched its UberX service earlier this month in Washington and other cities, putting it in direct competition with lower-cost cabs. The service operates in essentially the same way as Uber's original app, albeit with midsize, hybrid cars rather than luxury sedans. On Monday, however, the District of Columbia Taxicab... For every step of progress made by the ride-sharing industry in metropolitan havens like New York City, companies like Uber, Lyft, and SideCar continue to meet stiff resistance elsewhere.

The orders — signed by LA taxicab administrator Thomas M.  Drischler — warn each company that their respective business is ""operating an...

In December, the DC City Council decided to rewrite its taxi laws so that companies like Uber — which use mobile apps to hail cabs, black cars and other transportation — could bring their businesses to the district. And in January, the City Council passed an amendment to essentially legalize Uber's e-hail app. But in May, the DC Taxicab Commission proposed new restrictions on car-booking... Looks like New York City isn't going to hold a grudge against Uber for attempting to launch its taxi-hailing service without permission last summer. The San Francisco startup just became the first company to be approved under New York's new pilot program, which will allow selected companies to offer smartphone apps that let customers hail a cab from their phones. A group of about 30 drivers have parked their cars near Uber's headquarters in San Francisco and are protesting outside its doors, with plans to strike. The drivers, who aren't direct Uber employees but rather contractors that work with the company's taxi-hailing app, told The Next Web and All Things D that they were protesting unfair practices from the company. Their complaints ranged from pay cuts to mass-firings to the lack of a commercial insurance plan for drivers. All of the issues,... California's Public Utilities Commission has continued its reconciliation with ride-sharing startups. After suspending a $20,000 citation against Lyft, the CPUC has done the same for Uber, saying that the company can continue to operate and won't have to immediately pay the $20,000 it racked up for ""public safety violations."" In the meantime, regulators will reexamine California's transportation rules, determining how to fit startups into the existing framework of insurance requirements,... After winning a political battle in Washington, DC last month, controversial taxi startup Uber has announced it will be adding taxi service to its existing livery cars in the city. In a blog post, Uber praised the DC City Council's decision, saying that it would begin offering a pilot program for taxis starting today. For now, black car service will remain the default, and Uber says few taxis will be available at first as the company ""curates"" existing cabs. Otherwise, it'll operate like... Drivers and passengers in New York City can now use smartphone apps to hail nearby street cabs, thanks to a one-year pilot program that was just approved by the Taxi and Limousine Commission. The vote represents a partial victory for startups like Uber, Hailo, and Get Taxi, which had been lobbying New York City regulators to change the rules for months. The pilot program allows for passengers to use apps to hail street cabs that are within a half-mile radius in Manhattan below 59th Street,... Uber just won a showdown in Washington, D.C., one of the many cities where the traditional taxi and livery industry has revolted against the smartphone-native newcomer. After a drawn-out fight, the City Council unanimously passed the ""Public Vehicle-for-Hire Innovation Amendment Act"" this afternoon, which explicitly sanctions and regulates ""digital dispatch"" companies like Uber. Uber's opponents in DC and other cities objected to the maverick startup, saying its unconventional business model... Regulators from the US, Canada, and Australia are releasing guidelines on Friday for dealing with taxi apps like Uber and Zimride, reports The Wall Street Journal. While the rules would still have to be adopted by local governments, they would curtail the use of GPS as a substitute for a taxi meter, bar drivers without proper licensing from offering rides for pay, and prohibit charging extra during peak demand. Is the IATR protecting consumers or the taxi industry? The International... The New York Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) is releasing a list of proposed rule changes that would permit the use of smartphone apps to hail and pay for taxicabs, provided they work with the city’s own computerized payment and trip data system. The proposal comes two weeks after regulatory disputes forced the upstart Uber to end its own taxi service in the city. Every app would need to be licensed The proposals would require any e-hail app to obtain a one-year, renewable license from... Uber admitted just yesterday that it was dropping the taxi component of its service for New York residents due to regulatory disputes, but that's not stopping the company from moving forward: it's launching a similar service in San Francisco today. According to a post on the company's blog, the San Francisco Uber Taxi will let customers hail cabs with their iOS or Android device, just as they currently do for the company's other car services. The cost for a given ride will be generated from... Uber's ""damn the man"" strategy may have backfired. The San Francisco-based startup took a chance when it launched its taxi-hailing service in New York against the wishes of the local Taxi & Limousine Commission, hoping that the regulators would bend — or that customers would love Uber Taxi so much that the TLC would have to give it a pass. The goal was to be the first mover in a hotly-contested new market. However, after just over one month of operation, Uber is now asking taxi drivers to... Less than a day after we first heard that Massachusetts was blocking Uber from operating in Boston, the Office of Consumer Affairs and Business Regulation has reversed its decision. The service, if you're not familiar, is a private taxi service that works by smartphone: the user calls the taxi via a smartphone app, but critically an Uber app is also used by the driver to determine the distance driven for billing purposes. It's that last detail that caused a problem for the Commonwealth, which... Uber, the smartphone-dispatched private taxi service, isn't such a hit with local governments: the company narrowly avoided being priced into oblivion in Washington, DC, and this month it's being challenged in Boston. The reason might seem odd: according to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts Division of Standards, which held a hearing (PDF), the company's use of GPS-equipped smartphones is the culprit. Despite admitting that GPS positioning is reasonably accurate and has been in wide use for... Uber won a major victory in Washington, DC this week, when the City Council passed an amendment that effectively legalizes the company's car-booking app. The San Francisco-based startup makes an app that allows users to hire private sedans from their smartphones.

It's easy to take down infringing links from platforms like Google and YouTube, and a string of international prosecutions has turned file-sharing sites like The Pirate Bay and Isohunt into an endangered species. At the same time, more draconian measures that would wipe the sites off the internet entirely have largely failed within the US after a string of legislative defeats that culminated in 2011's SOPA and PIPA fights. A secret ""site-blocking confab"" with a senior Comcast engineer But Hollywood isn't happy with the status quo, new documents purporting to be from the Sony hack show that the MPAA still sees SOPA-style site blocking as a primary goal, a stance that has put them increasingly at odds with Google. Blocking pirate sites is such a focus that the MPAA often rules out more incremental efforts at fighting piracy on the grounds that they would stand in the way of the group's ultimate goal, which is to restrict users from browsing certain web sites. The industry may have lost the fight to make SOPA law, but it’s still aggressively pursuing SOPA’s goals. On October 8th, Hollywood lawyers met for a secret ""site-blocking confab"" with a senior Comcast engineer at the MPAA's offices in Sherman Oaks. A leaked agenda from the meeting (pasted below) shows a crash course in the basic technical issues of site-blocking, from IP- and URL-based tactics to the larger political landscape. One session offered ""Lessons from the Field,"" asking, ""Have there been issues in site-blocking to date that should inform our thinking?"" The group also circulated an earlier technical analysis, which suggested a hybrid model combining IP-based and URL-based models. If US law ever offers a way to wipe copyright-infringing sites off the web, the MPAA will know exactly how to do it. The failure of SOPA in 2011 seems to have scared the MPAA away from any effort to pass new laws, so instead the group is looking for more aggressive ways to interpret existing law. One email sent by MPAA counsel Steven Fabrizio on August 9th, lays out a number of ways the MPAA might file ""no-fault"" injunctions that don't require wrongdoing by ISPs, whether through DMCA section 512j or the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. (The 512j argument is embedded below.) Either avenue would allow the group to respect the DMCA's safe harbor clauses, while still effectively blocking infringing content from the web. If the legal arguments succeed, Hollywood might get site-blocking powers without having to bother with a SOPA-style law. Hollywood might get site-blocking powers without having to bother with a SOPA-style law Another report explores whether site-blocking might be possible through the US International Trade Commission, which administers US trade laws. The ITC could potentially require ISPs to block pirate sites, but according to the emails, the legal reasoning required might prove too risky to try out in court. According to the memo, the idea was first proposed by Jenner & Block on August 3rd, 2012, but has resurfaced over and over in the years since. Ultimately, Fabrizio seems cautious on the approach, saying, ""an action in the ITC would require the Commission (and the Federal Circuit on appeal) to resolve a number of novel issues in our favor. As such, the ITC appears to be a more complex and uncertain approach than the federal court approaches we have discussed."" In each case, the MPAA shows a single-minded focus on site-blocking as the most important tool in the fight against piracy — but that focus has also come with a cost. Making the case to block a site like The Pirate Bay requires the studios to treat the site as entirely devoted to illegal content, which has occasionally prevented them from engaging with the sites to fight piracy within the system. In previously published documents, Sony was forced to abandon a novel torrent-based publicity effort for exactly this reason. Earlier this year, one executive suggested the studio seed fake versions of a television show that would redirect users to legal versions of the same content. The idea was met with widespread approval, but was ultimately nixed by legal concerns. ""Unfortunately the studio position is that we cannot post content (even promos) on torrent sites,"" wrote senior executive Pamela Parker. Elaborating on the reason, she said only that it ""has something to do with the coordinated efforts with the MPAA."" The result is an all-or-nothing bet by the MPAA. As long as the industry is going after site-blocking powers, it can’t pursue more peaceful measures like seeding promos and steering file-sharers to paid downloads. It also forces the industry to cross swords with Google, as it pushes for more and more control over the open web. It’s made the MPAA a lot of enemies — and so far, the industry doesn’t have much to show for it. But judging by the leaks, Hollywood won't give up the fight any time soon.

The case pits Marvel against Stephen Kimble, an inventor who sold it a patent for a glove that shoots a foam string out of its palm, much like Spider-Man's web shooters. Marvel agreed to pay Kimble a percentage of product sales indefinitely, but it stopped paying him after the patent expired. It can seemingly do that because of a 1964 Supreme Court ruling, from the case Brulotte v. Thys Co., which makes it illegal to collect royalties on an expired patent, and now Kimble is heading back to that court in an attempt to overturn its ruling. The Supreme Court today agreed to hear the lawsuit, which should enter the court sometime next spring.  The Justice Department didn't want this case in the Supreme Court The Court initially made the ruling because a patent, by itself, was considered to be fairly powerful, and allowing patent owners to make agreements extending beyond a patent's lifetime would only grant them more power. In particular, the court noted concern that a patent holder might require someone licensing a patent to also license expired patents in order to seal the deal — a bargaining power that would have undermined the intent of making patents eventually open up to the public. Effectively, it would give some added leverage where they already have a monopoly. Kimble thinks it's possible that the court will now overturn that ruling. His lawsuit argues that it's now out of line with modern competition law, which doesn't view the patent as being quite as powerful as it once was. However, the Justice Department argued against this thinking in a filing with the court, recommending that it not take up the case at all. There are also some outstanding issues that could prevent Kimble from overturning the court's earlier ruling: for one, this is an agreement based on a patent sale, not licensing, and on top of that, his agreement with Marvel doesn't differentiate between royalty payments and payments simply because of the sale. That means there are some other potentially tricky issues at play, but the fate of the Brulotte ruling is definitely in question.

That's an important detail that's still being hashed out ahead of next week, when the trial comes to a close and a jury of eight begins its deliberations. Despite the lack of a plaintiff, Apple presented evidence defending itself from the claims that it harmed consumers when creating the DRM system for iTunes and the iPod. Today, Apple's lawyers said they still needed another day to file last-minute paperwork over ""some last pieces of information"" about a potential plaintiff who has spent the past few days being vetted in order to replace two other plaintiffs who were removed earlier in the trial. Last week, evidence emerged they either did not buy the correct devices or bought them outside the time period of the complaint, leaving the case's lawyers scrambling to find a replacement. The jury gets to decide next week The entire complaint hinges on exactly why Apple hardened its digital rights management software in iTunes and iPods nearly a decade ago. According to the suit, which was filed back in 2005, two updates Apple made to its iTunes and iPod software actively kept other companies from connecting their devices the jukebox software, as well as kept users from playing music from other stores on their iPods. It also claims Apple used that system to systematically raise the prices of iPods during that time, making more money in the process. Taking a turn to defend itself this week, witnesses for Apple, which included two economists and its former VP of marketing and business management, made the case that the company not only improved its products from 2006 to 2009, but also managed to reduce prices of those devices in the process. In question are some models of the iPod nano, the iPod Classic, the iPod touch, and iPod Shuffle. Mark Donnelly, who worked under Apple's marketing chief Phil Schiller and retired from the company last October, argued that Apple was always trying to fit more features into a new models, and consistently discounting older models. He recalled one such time that Jeff Williams, who is currently Apple's senior vice president of operations, ran into him in the middle of Apple's campus, and excitedly told him they could double the amount of storage they were planning to include in the upcoming iPod nano, but without spending more. ""Nobody really knew we'd done that."" ""Jeff said ‘Mark, we're getting lots better prices on the flash. We could actually do better — we could double the memory of these [iPod] nanos,'"" Donnelly recalled. The only problem is that the company had already finalized the product's launch, and was in the process of assembling millions of them overseas. The pair successfully pitched the idea to increase the memory up to Schiller, and Apple went about striking the deal on the larger memory, immediately building the higher configurations, then ultimately shipping the original ones to smaller markets at a lower cost, with nobody the wiser. ""Nobody really knew we'd done that,"" Donnelly said. ""We really enjoyed that we were able to pull it off.""   Donnelly also recalled his time as part of an exclusive Apple committee that would come together to decide the prices for all the company's new products. Where late Apple CEO Steve Jobs once said the company had ""zero"" committees because Apple functioned like a startup, Donnelly painted an entirely different picture, explaining in detail how the company's senior executives and other ""decision makers"" would meet together in person, or on the phone to come up with the price for upcoming products, poring over gross margins, product specs, and head-to-head comparisons with devices made by other companies. Earlier in the case, the plaintiffs had brought out planning documents from these meetings to suggest that Apple was acutely aware of the competition and its market share, including that of iTunes. Donnelly said he'd looked at the iTunes market share ""from time to time,"" but that did not elaborate on how it affected how Apple priced its products. Prior to Donnelly, Apple called upon two professors from the University of Chicago, Robert Topel and Kevin Murphy, to poke holes in the damages calculations of the plaintiffs' economist Roger Noll. They said Noll hadn't factored in improvements to Apple's products in his analysis, and that changes like extra storage, longer battery life, larger screens, and new software features made iPods better over time. Murphy also compared Apple's integrated system of the iPod and iTunes to video game consoles from Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo, as well as Amazon's Kindle, saying it was an identical idea. ""Integration is not an all or nothing thing. There are varying levels of integration."" ""Some of the [game] titles will be the same,"" Donnelly said in his comparison to video game consoles. ""But the actual thing you purchase will only work on that other system. They're malevolent. Integration is not an all or nothing thing. There are varying levels of integration."" The part of Apple's integration that under scrutiny are two security measures that were rolled out a year apart in iTunes and Apple's iPod software. One verifies the iTunes library, whereas the other verifies what's known as the keybag on iPod — basically a set of digital keys to unlock songs that have DRM. Once activated, these security measures did a number of things, from keeping iPods from playing songs that had DRM that had been tampered with, to keeping third-parties from changing the database of songs with jukebox software apps. ""I was told to authenticate the third-party player and keep them from syncing."" Rod Schultz, a former Apple engineer who had built a key aspect of the library checker, said today that he'd originally been tasked with the job because the company wanted to keep Linux-based music players from accessing the iTunes library after it had been reverse-engineered. ""I was told that third-party players were corrupting [Apple's] database, so I was told to authenticate the third-party player and keep them from syncing,"" Schultz said. That became a feature in iTunes, and later right on the iPod, though Schultz — who left the company in 2008 to go build DRM technology for Adobe — said he hadn't worked on the version that went onto the iPod. Earlier in the trial, Apple had argued that such third-party players, including one made by RealNetworks, attempted to hijack the iPod and created all sorts of issues for users that would damage a user's music library and the performance of their iPod. That's become a point of contention where Apple's said it was trying to protect users from buggy software, while the plaintiffs have accused it of shutting out competition. The $350 million in damages Apple could be on the hook for is relatively small, but could triple if the jury says the company willfully violated antitrust laws, something that would push it beyond what Apple initially won in its patent trial against Samsung two years ago. Today was the last day of evidence from either side, with the jury set to begin deliberations after closing arguments next week.",0.5029318865102361,0.4970681134897639,0.8648058341095574,1223,5.0040883074407194,594,6.2340067340067344,0,2,"Apple, Policy & Law, Tech, US & World, Report",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

Spotify is now valued at $8.4 billion Spotify began this latest funding round in early April, and was originally seeking $400 million to reach a valuation worth double that of competitor Pandora. The successful round means that Spotify has now pulled in more than $1 billion from investors, but even with that influx of money and 15 million paying subscribers, Spotify's future is not entirely secure. The company's business model means it still operates at a loss — the Swedish firm has to pay almost 70 percent of its revenue to label owners and musicians for rights and royalties. The half-billion dollars taken during during this funding round show that the business world still believes in Spotify, but it will need to either renegotiate how it pays labels, or start convincing more of its 45 million free users to part with their money if it wants to stay on top in an increasingly crowded marketplace.

Audiences have since gotten bored with the parlor trick, she says, and to keep theme park tickets selling, her team needs to amp things up: bigger, louder, “more teeth.”  Of course, the same thing could be said for the state of the movie industry and the massive, global corporate interests that dictate the films we get every year. That self-referential nod is no accident, and it’s just one of several threads of commentary that run through writer-director Colin Trevorrow’s new film. Fourteen years after Jurassic Park III thankfully faded into the mists of memory, the director of the indie hit Safety Not Guaranteed is attempting to bring the franchise back to life with a movie that reaches for the best of Steven Spielberg’s original while refusing to dumb itself down.  The craziest thing is that it practically works. One of Jurassic World’s smartest decisions is omission, and it makes it right at the top: the movie all but retcons Jurassic Park II and III out of existence. Instead, the island that served as the setting for the original film has become home to a massive island-wide resort known as Jurassic World. It’s a luxury destination and theme park, overseen by the uptight Claire (Howard), who’s juggling visits from the park’s billionaire benefactor (Irrfan Khan) and her two nephews (Nick Robinson and Ty Simpkins) — who in true Spielberg movie fashion, have been shipped off while their parents deal with divorce proceedings. The park is getting ready to unveil its latest attraction: a custom-built, genetic hybrid dinosaur known as the Indominus rex. Somehow an entire park full of scientists and geneticists haven’t realized that the Indominus is smarter and more savage than any of their other beasts (it’s one of many head-scratchers), so Claire pulls in an animal expert named Owen (Chris Pratt) to help her out. Owen’s a dinosaur whisperer, spending most of his time training velociraptors to act on his command, but when he sees the Indominus, he knows instantly that if the creature ever gets loose things will go very, very wrong. Then the creature gets loose. Before you complain about spoilers, you should know that I’m leaving out two entire storylines in that set-up. Biting off more than it can chew is the biggest problem with Jurassic World, particularly during its first half. The project was in development for over a decade, and while Trevorrow and his writing partner Derek Connolly have certainly put their stamp on things, at times you almost hear the ghostly screams of previous iterations. It’s most noticeable with Claire’s two nephews, who never feel credible — Simpkins’ character ricochets from crying over his parents’ divorce to childlike wonder on a per-scene basis — and end up serving little function beyond some convenient stakes-upping and giving the movie the opportunity to show off different sections of the park. The movie’s real focus is on Claire and Owen, who also have some issues in the chemistry department — particularly in their first scene together, a sequence that invoked Joss Whedon’s online ire when it was released as a sneak peek. It’s an awkward and uncomfortable scene built upon some outdated gender archetypes; Pratt projecting would-be machismo without his usual wink, and Howard committing to Claire’s OCD stuffiness to such a degree that she’s almost robotic. From there, the film starts walking down a very uncomfortable path, complete with rote jokes about wearing high heels in the jungle, but as the action picks up, both characters thaw. By the time Claire becomes a formidable hero of her own, it becomes apparent that Trevorrow is tweaking the stereotypes he put into place, subverting them in the same way the film’s theme of corporate excess goes after the hand that funded it. Jurassic World is a self-aware blockbuster, the latest in a growing trend that includes films like The Lego Movie and The Avengers, and it’s a welcome change — except for when it gets in its own way. Laying out a thinly veiled critique of the blockbuster mentality is clever, but here it’s so on-point it pulls you out of the movie, detracting from the action ride that is truly at the movie’s heart. Similar issues befall the film’s characterization of Claire: the movie may be trying to set up and knock down an antiquated cinematic stereotype, but if the execution is so clunky that the audience is put off by its first impressions, there’s not much left to work with. In that sense, Jurassic World could have benefited from being just a little less clever, because when it comes to crafting action sequences, Trevorrow is impeccable. His camerawork is confident, his staging clear, and he’s able to create a sense of foreboding and menace with the camera in a way that feels, quite simply, Spielbergian. Visual effects blend seamlessly with live-action elements in a way that filmmakers that have directed big budget films for decades aren’t able to accomplish. The second half of Jurassic World is when the film hits its stride, heralding the arrival of a filmmaker that is able to tackle the challenges of a huge movie while keeping the audience in safe, considerate hands. That’s something that’s all too rare in and of itself, and cause for celebration despite Jurassic World’s faults. And admittedly, equally important is the context of the criticisms. As I was discussing the film with a colleague recently, I realized we were critiquing it not in terms of The Lost World or Jurassic Park III, but only in terms of the original film. Just as Jurassic World’s plot does away with the second and third films, the new film’s quality has retconned them from memory. The only question, then, is whether or not it lives up to what some consider to be one of Steven Spielberg’s best films. It doesn’t, of course, but it’s bigger, louder, and has more teeth — and it knows how to use them.

When it set up a countdown on its site, though, it might have revealed more than it intended. A few enterprising fans dug up images buried in the code — images that, at first glance, look like the design for a final Oculus Rift. That includes a headset, an external camera, a ""vrOS,"" and a remote-like controller that would ship with the device. Oculus co-founder Palmer Luckey has even confirmed that the images are real. But we still don't know how much they tell us about the real consumer Rift. ""This is an old placeholder concept image that we accidentally leaked. Everything in it is ancient, certainly nowhere close to final,"" Luckey wrote on Reddit. ""Enjoy checking it out, at this point, but don't expect everything to carry through to the stream on the 11th."" Oculus has every reason to play down the images, but in this case, there are a few signs that we're looking at something old and unfinished. As Luckey points out in his comment, one image suggests pairing the Rift with some relatively outdated PC parts, compared to the high-end specs it's since announced. The field of view is set to a placeholder, which is slightly odd given that it's consistently hovered around 100 degrees. The whole render looks a little flat compared to the promotional images we've seen. Some things, however, do match up pretty well. The rear view of the render is very similar to the one on Oculus' official countdown page, shown on top here:   The bottom-up view of the official press shot (left) and the leaked render also aren't too far off:   The images in the background of these shots, incidentally, are primarily from the demo Oculus used to show off Crescent Bay in September of 2014. A couple of them hint at something more recent: one is a shot from Oculus' VR short film Lost, which was announced early this year, and another is an ad for the Gear VR Insurgent tie-in, which appeared in February. There are two big differences between what we've seen and what was just leaked. First, there's a camera at the bottom of the leaked Rift render. The fact that it seems angled downwards, as at least one Redditor has pointed out, suggests that it's a hand-tracking sensor rather than a simple camera — in other words, a built-in version of the Leap Motion OSVR headplate. The camera is distinctly absent on the official Rift images, so either this was a potential feature that Oculus decided against incorporating, or (in a less likely development) Oculus has been deliberately hiding its existence. Second, the leaked images say every Rift will come with ""the Rift headset, the Rift tracker [its external camera], the SID (Simple Input Device), a gamepad, and cables."" The Simple Input Device, as (it appears) seen below, looks like a small remote control with a trackpad very similar to the one on Valve's gamepad. Beyond that, though, it doesn't seem to have much beyond volume controls and a ""back"" button; it's sort of like the Gear VR's integrated controls wrapped into a separate piece of hardware. Frankly, it doesn't look like a lot of fun, but Oculus has said before that it's splitting its attention between long-term solutions and short-term stopgaps for controls, so it's not out of the realm of possibility.   Sadly, a price wasn't leaked as part of these images, although a partnership with NewEgg is mentioned (Oculus and Samsung already sell their Gear VR headset through Best Buy). Oculus has previously said that the consumer Rift and a PC capable of running it will cost under $1,500.",0.27702869605679714,0.7229713039432029,0.20748562228405734,627,4.735247208931419,355,5.8112676056338026,0,6,"Culture, Entertainment, Gaming",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Bored, maybe a little drunk, you strike up a conversation with the next person over. You start discussing your life, as you do. Your history. And soon you realize that your paths may have crossed at a cafe you both love or a city where you both lived. You try to match dates but you’ll never really know how close you came to meeting. Until now. Last night Google announced its new Your Timeline feature in Maps that lets you ""view the places you’ve been on a given day, month or year."" Like most things Google does, it feels a bit creepy, if not downright foreboding in the post-Snowden era. But like most Google services it’s also pretty fantastic when viewed optimistically. Right now Your Timeline is, as the name suggests, private and only visible to you. But it won’t be long before some enterprising developer (or even Google) offers a way for multiple people to compare location histories and identify dates and places where paths have crossed. Where chance encounters might have happened had fate intervened. I can already guess the name: Our Timeline. It’s the big data equivalent of discovering your wife (as a toddler) lurking in the background of a childhood photo snapped at Disney World. Or that couple who unknowingly shared the same beach as kids 20 years before their marriage. Imagine a future where wedding invites arrive decorated with GIFs showing a couple’s divergent location histories merging to form a single path. Created automatically by Google Photos, of course, complete with slideshow. I can also imagine several dystopian outcomes, too, but let’s just try to stay positive, ok?  If you're all-in on Google services — say, if you use Google Now on your smartphone — you're likely aware of the fact that Google tracks your location to serve you useful information. What you might not realize is just how much location data Google has on you. Surprisingly enough, the company has just turned that somewhat creepy bit of info into a new feature called Your Timeline. The upcoming James Bond flick Spectre has a had slow burn so far, with plotless teaser trailers and teasers for teasers for posters.

And the teen birth rate has dropped by 57 percent since 1991. That said, teenagers still aren't using the most effective contraceptive, the IUD. And the US teen birth rate remains higher than that of other developed countries.

Nobody expected Apple to tell us how many Apple Watches it sold last quarter. The company signaled last quarter that it would lump those sales into the category that includes the iPod, Apple TV, and Beats accessories. Cook also previously stated that there were competitive reasons for keeping the precise sales numbers quiet. Analyst estimates before Apple's earnings announcement hovered somewhere north of 3 million for the quarter, but it was expected that the most likely thing we'd actually hear from Cook is how delighted he is by Apple's customer satisfaction numbers. Cook loves saying ""customer sat,"" and for good reason: Apple's performance there is uncannily good. In an interview with The New York Times, Apple CFO Luca Maestri said that sales for the Apple Watch ""sales in its first nine weeks exceeded those of the iPhone and iPad in their first nine weeks of availability."" Apple itself said that the iPad sold 3 million units in the first 11 weeks, so that gives us some kind of ballpark. More specifics may be hard to come by, though. In Apple's press release, CEO Tim Cook said it was ""a great start for Apple Watch"" and also noted that watchOS 2 would come out in the fall. One thing we can look at is the revenue in that ""Other"" category. As you can see in the chart below, Apple earned around $1.7 billion last quarter in the category. This quarter, that number jumped to $2.64 billion. That's a big jump, and though of course we can't say it's all due to the Apple Watch, that's going to be the thing everybody supposes until Apple tells us otherwise. Speaking to the Associated Press, Maestri said that Apple Watch revenue was ""well over"" the difference between those numbers — presumably because sales on the iPod were down last quarter. Maestri added, ""We beat our internal expectations."" So it seems like a safe bet that Apple Watch revenue was over $1 billion.  But trying to map the delta in those revenues to Apple Watch unit sales is especially difficult. We'd need to know whether the price drop for the Apple TV made a difference, for one thing. The ""Other"" category also includes Beats accessories, though, so those sales factor into that final number as well. But most importantly, the price of the Apple Watch can vary so widely — from around $350 all the way up to the $20,000 range — that mapping revenue to unit sales seems like a fool's errand. Bottom line: it's going to be difficult to pin down exact sales numbers without Apple giving us specifics. But beating the original iPhone and iPad in its first nine weeks is probably better than Watch pessimists had expected. Update: Here are Tim Cook's comments on watch sales from the earnings call. Cook noted that June was the best month for Apple Watch sales so far, surpassing both April and May, despite reports to the contrary. His take on the ""Other"" category largely confirms what we were already thinking — Apple Watch sales account for more than that quarter-over-quarter or year-over-year delta, but exactly how much is still unclear. As you know, we made a decision back in September, several months ago, no to disclose the shipments of the watch. And that was not a matter of not being transparent, it was a matter of not giving the competition insight, on a product that we worked really hard on. However, let me give you some color, to avoid reaching sort of a wrong conclusion. If you look at the ""other products"" category and look at the revenue in this category, it would not be an accurate thing to just look at the sequential change or the year-over-year change and assume that were the total watch revenue. Because the aggregate balance of that category both sequentially and year-over-year is shrinking. Obviously iPod is a part of that, but there are other things in there — accessories and so forth — that are shrinking. Secondly, to provide a bit more color. The sales of the Watch did exceed our expectations. And they did so despite supply still trailing demand at the end of the quarter. To give you additional insight, through the end of the quarter, in fact that the Apple Watch sell through was higher than the comparable launch periods of the original iPhone or the original iPad. We were able to do with with having only 680 points of sale. As you probably know, as I had reviewed earlier, the online sales were so great at the beginning, we were not able to feed inventory to our stores until mid-June. And so those points of sale, pretty much, the overwhelming majority of the low number of sales were not there until the last two weeks of the quarter. And so as I look at all of these things, we feel really great about how we did. Now our objective for the quarter wasn't primarily sales. Beyond the very good news on sales, we're more excited about how the product is positioned for the long term because we're starting a new category. And as I back up and look at this with 8,500 apps, we've already announced the next operating system watchOS 2 — it will bring native apps, which are going to be killer, to the watch. Even though the store layout was delayed, we learned a lot about the experience. Based on that experience, we're now planning to expand our channel before the holiday. Because we're convinced that the watch is going to be one of the top gifts of the holiday seasons. Most important of all of this is the customer sat is off the charts. We've constantly seen if you can get the customer sat off the charts, you wind up doing fairly well over time. We've also learned a lot about managing quite an assortment and so forth. And so I back up and look at this and I feel fantastic about what the team has done and delivered and I know I never go anywhere without the watch and it's not because I'm the CEO. I'm that attached to it. I get lots of notes from a lot of people that feel the same way. That's how I look at the watch.

In fitting with Google's typically excellent app design, Your Timeline shows up in a nice, scrollable format that reminds me of the new Google Calendar app, letting you swipe your way through a day to see where Google saw you. It even pulls in relevant photos you might have taken if you're using the Google Photos app for that extra bit of ""this is your life"" oddness.

The group released a lengthy statement on Sunday that mostly calls for stricter regulations on e-cigarettes, especially when it comes to marketing aimed at children. In a surprise, though, AHA also acknowledges that there's research indicating that e-cigarettes may help smokers quit entirely.  As Aruni Bhatnagar, professor of medicine at the University of Louisville in Kentucky and the lead author of the AHA's statement, wrote: ""If someone refuses to quit, we’re not opposed to them switching from conventional to e-cigarettes...Don’t use them indefinitely. Set a quit date for quitting conventional, e-cigarettes and everything else. We don’t think that will be the long-term or useful way to look at it because e-cigarettes may continue and fuel nicotine addiction. Nicotine is not innocuous — it’s known to be harmful and have cardiovascular effects."" Overall, the AHA's position on e-cigarettes as tobacco alternative is not nearly as positive. The group notes that many e-cigarette makers present their products as a safer and more attractive alternative to smoking by using the term ""vaping."" The AHA also faults companies for offering flavor varieties that may appeal to children (""bubble gum, caramel, chocolate, fruit and mint, all attractive to young people,"" in the organization's words). The group wants to see the US Food and Drug Administration, which is finalizing new regulations for e-cigarettes, impose tighter restrictions on their sales and advertising.

The report also calls for regulations on the contents of e-cigarettes and raised concerns over the interests of major tobacco companies, which have begun to command a greater share of a market that saw $3 billion in sales last year. Today's report comes two days after the American Heart Association (AHA) weighed in on the debate, saying in a statement that e-cigarettes could be used to help people quit smoking. Health experts are divided on the benefits and potential pitfalls of using e-cigarettes, with some saying they could save lives by turning people away from traditional cigarettes, and others warning that they could ""renormalize"" smoking and encourage youths to pick up the habit. But both the AHA and WHO agree that stronger regulations are needed, with each organization raising concerns over how the products are marketed. The AHA also said that they should be regulated under existing rules for tobacco products. ""not merely water vapor""   In its report, the WHO called for a ban on fruity- and candy-flavored e-cigarette products that may appeal to minors, and that their ""e-liquids"" should be regulated to ""minimize content and emissions of toxicants."" It also suggested that governments regulate the health claims that some manufacturers are making in the absence of strong empirical evidence, and recommended bans on vending machines in most places. The organization added that e-cigarettes expose non-smokers and bystanders to nicotine, and that evidence suggests that their emissions are ""not merely water vapor"" as many believe. The report was published as part of the WHO's Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, an international public health treaty that came into effect in 2005. Since then, 179 countries have ratified the treaty, with the US standing as a major exception.

So cool that when humans do something really big in science — like putting a remote-control robot on another planet — the whole world stands still to watch. So cool that it seems like this year we've seen Bill Nye's face more than ever. So cool that science invaded mainstream arts with the return of Cosmos, and we crowned Neil deGrasse Tyson as a brainy superstar. So why wasn't he sitting near Matthew McConaughey last night at the Emmys? He never had a chance, because the Television Academy didn't give him one. Shows like Cosmos live in the academy's closet, in a box behind the costumes, where they don't have to be seen next to the beautiful people. Every year, the academy rounds up all the nerds and sequesters them to the ""Creative Arts Emmys:"" a giant overflow room where you put people who basically make television happen but aren't good enough to be on television. I mean, just look at Matthew McConaughey. We can't have nerds sitting next to him! Only people who play nerds on television, like those guys from The Big Bang Theory.  The academy has decided 'Dancing With the Stars' is more important than 'Cosmos' To some degree this is a logistical problem and the academy's solution makes total sense. The Primetime Emmys, like The Oscars, seem to drag on forever, and putting the Creative Arts awards in there would make it a 12 hour show. And let's face it: we happen to like seeing beautiful people get awards for being beautiful and talented. But it doesn't have to be an all-or-nothing game. The academy has made choices about what it wants to put on television that have nothing to do time constraints. It has decided (resoundingly!) that the host of Dancing with the Stars is more important than the host of Cosmos. This particular perversion bites twice: once when we realize we're getting the television shows we deserve, and again when we realize that the locus of ""reality"" in the TV universe corresponds to a show wherein Howie Mandel uses a Vanna White clone army to award strangers with money in front of a studio audience, and not a beautifully produced series on science that literally describes reality. After filming the #CosmosFinale, @SethMacFarlane & I knocked back a cold one on the crescent Moon. pic.twitter.com/pTPFhcI1Hc  The truth is that there isn't even an award category for people who host shows like Cosmos. The Emmys are, as one Hollywood insider told me today, ""where taste goes to die."" It's where Modern Family wins awards over shows like Louie, which even the dim court of public opinion seems to find patently unreasonable. My colleague Sam Byford put it well: ""shows like the Emmys exist in a weird space between critical acclaim and pure ratings,"" he said. And of course, we tend to lean towards the side of critical acclaim when a show or an actor we kinda like wins. (I'm looking at your perfectly grown cheekbones, Benedict Cumberbatch.) So, yeah, the Emmys are superficial and often tone deaf. This is as novel as Hollywood insiders are unpredictable. But it could at least appear to appreciate where science and art collide on the main stage, even for just a few minutes a year.  It's not as if the Emmy's producers even knows how to create good TV. ""What truly matters is that we never forget that our success is based on always giving the viewer something compelling to watch,"" the academy president said last night, after giving viewers a verbal PowerPoint presentation on The Value Of Television. But maybe next year, the academy will make better choices. Maybe it will spend less time acting out twee bits nobody wants to see. Maybe it won't put a woman on a spinning pedestal, like a cone of shawarma, to force an unsightly, ironic joke — a joke that would have never existed if the people in charge had thought about it for more than three seconds. Maybe it will give Neil deGrasse Tyson an Emmy. At least give the guy a chance.

The crop fields at the top of this image haven't turned green yet (despite their false color). What's beneath them — a stretch of mountains that have been carved by water — are, however, covered in green. The ground on this plateau has been cut apart by erosion.

This vine is absolute confirmation that no matter how many hours I would have spent training in the Air Force or studying for high-level degrees, the first thing I'd do after getting on-board the ISS would be to find this clone of the training droid from A New Hope, put on a helmet — with the blast shield down — and start swinging at it with a broom handle (actually I doubt they have brooms on the ISS, so maybe a flashlight? A laser pointer?). Basically what I'm getting at here is that I'd be a useless addition to the ISS crew. There's a 100 percent chance that, were any of us to get the chance to float around the ISS, we would be tempted to play with this experiment that the astronauts use to study combustion in a zero gravity environment. There's also a great chance that something would go wrong. You'd literally be playing with fire — and in an oxygen-rich environment, no less. The next thing you'd know something would go boom, the Space Station would begin to fall apart, and then George Clooney's ghost would have to help us into the Russian space capsule so we could escape to Earth (spoiler alert). My favorite by far, this is the orbital equivalent of seeing a crazy storm breathing down your town's neck and rushing to your phone to document it. Reid Wiseman is basically the first storm-chaser in space, which is totally going to be a thing when we all have our own private spacecraft (you know, in 2237). We'll hear about Hurricane Kardashian from CNN 7 on our brain implants, and these space-faring storm-chasers will rush straight through the rumbling clouds so they can hover above the earth and beam back footage from the other side. ""They're so reckless,"" future people will say, but by then we'll have the ability to internally block the voices of people we don't wan't to listen to (one can hope). Okay, this might be the ""terrible 3D-movie gag"" of space vines, but you can't deny how cool it is that a yo-yo still works in zero gravity! If you had asked me before I saw this, I would totally have thought I knew all of the reasons why it wouldn't. I would have also confidently told you that, no, kind sir or ma'am, there is no way in hell that something that relies so heavily on gravity's influence could possibly work in space, at which point you could have showed me this vine and then dumped a bucket of ice water on my head. This astronaut right here is totally in a panic. He's been late on his space rent three times now, his landlord is coming to collect tomorrow, and of course now the pipes burst on his space commode. He's not sure which ISS roommate broke it, but he's got a hunch. Unfortunately, there's no time to point fingers. Frantically, he locks himself into place (let's see you attempt plumbing while floating freely in a zero-g environment) and gets to work. He'll be damned if he's going to be on the hook for this, and he needs that security deposit when he gets back down to Earth. Readjusting to to normal life isn't cheap, you know. Sure, it isn't the most exciting leafy vegetable on Earth, but now that it's in orbit it's totally the coolest. All other vegetables are super jealous that they have to fight gravity to grow while lettuce just gets to kick back and float aboard the International Space Station. Lettuce has it so easy, man. I'll just say what we're all thinking here: this astronaut is totally a Bond villain, right? I mean, this is almost exactly the same thing that that one Bond villain did in The World is Not Enough, except that was on a submarine. I'm pretty sure that if you turn up your headphones loudly enough you can hear the beginning of an evil cackle right before the vine starts to loop. Okay, in all seriousness, vines from space are pretty cool, and the first one ever is no exception. What purpose do they serve, you ask? It's a fair question — we should always be aware of where our tax dollars go. While they might not serve some outstandingly apparent purpose like memory foam mattresses, water purification technology, or LASIK surgery, vines from space — along with tweets, instagrams, and maybe someday Pinterest pins or Tinder swipes — make the incredibly intellectual work being done by scientists who are orbiting our planet feel accessible, which in turn can inspire young minds to do great things in the future (even though they're probably too busy using Snapchat). .feature-body .vox-feature-list .vox-feature-story {width: 35%;}.feature-body hr:before {display:none;}.feature-body .vox-feature-list h4 {font-size: 30px;line-height: 30px;font-family: ff-din-web-condensed,helvetica,sans-serif;font-weight: 700;margin:0px;padding:0px;}.feature-body .vox-feature-list h3 {font-family: ff-din-web-condensed,helvetica,sans-serif;font-size: 47px;font-weight: 700;text-align: center;margin: 0 0 1em 0;text-transform: uppercase;}.feature-body .vox-feature-list li {background: #fff;margin-bottom: 1.5em;padding: 10px;position: relative;/* border: 1px solid #eee; */box-shadow: 0px 0px 3px #eee;}.feature-body .vox-feature-list .vox-feature-story {width: 35%;}.feature-body hr:before {display:none;}.feature-body .vox-feature-list h4 {font-size: 30px;line-height: 30px;font-family: ff-din-web-condensed,helvetica,sans-serif;font-weight: 700;margin:0px;padding:0px;}.feature-body .vox-feature-list h3 {font-family: ff-din-web-condensed,helvetica,sans-serif;font-size: 47px;font-weight: 700;text-align: center;margin: 0 0 1em 0;text-transform: uppercase;}.feature-body .vox-feature-list li {background: #fff;margin-bottom: 1.5em;padding: 10px;position: relative;/* border: 1px solid #eee; */box-shadow: 0px 0px 3px #eee;}.feature-body .vox-feature-list li h4:before {background: #e22805;content: counter(mylist,decimal);counter-increment: mylist 1;font-family: ff-din-web-condensed,helvetica,sans-serif;font-size: 32px;font-weight: 700;left: 20px;padding: 10px 20px 3px;position: absolute;text-align: center;top: 0;width: 40px;-webkit-transition: all ease-in-out;-webkit-transition-delay: 0.3s;-moz-transition: all ease-in-out 0.3s;-o-transition: all ease-in-out 0.3s;transition: all ease-in-out 0.3s;color: #fff;}h1#stream_title {text-align: left;}h2.title1.badged {font-size: 1.4em;}.link-fest, .credits {display: none;}.feature-body a {color: #e22805;text-decoration: none;}.clearfix:after {	content: ""."";	display: block;	clear: both;	visibility: hidden;	line-height: 0;	height: 0;} .clearfix {	display: inline-block;} html[xmlns] .clearfix {	display: block;} * html .clearfix {	height: 1%;}.feature-body .vox-feature-list li h4:before {counter-increment: mylist 0!important;}",0.4021576176633547,0.5978423823366452,0.501354305757406,1258,5.7090620031796506,677,6.8153618906942395,0,0,,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Here's why that never would have happened The Oculus Rift virtual reality headset raised $2.4 million on Kickstarter, no strings attached. Those donors weren’t looking for a payout; they wanted to support something they believed in, and maybe get a pair of virtual reality goggles to play with. But when Facebook bought Oculus a year and a half later for $2 billion in cash and stock, backers wondered: what if I’d asked for equity instead of a poster? ""I would have rather bought a few shares of Oculus rather than my now-worthless $300 obsolete VR headset,"" backer Carlos Schulte wrote. If Schulte’s donation had been an investment, he could have earned around $43,500, estimates Greg Belote, the co-founder of equity crowdfunding platform Wefunder — a stunning 145x return. Kickstarter doesn’t allow creators to offer equity, and the company has said it never will. But a bunch of other crowdfunding sites will soon be launching to fill that gap. ""I would have rather bought a few shares of Oculus rather than my now-worthless $300 obsolete VR headset."" Previously, investing for equity was restricted to an elite, wealthy group of so-called ""accredited investors."" But under Title III of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act, companies will be allowed to issue stock to the public exchange for small investments, just like Kickstarter campaigns reward backers with T-shirts and other goodies. There are already scores of equity-based crowdfunding sites at the starting line — Wefunder, SeedInvest, and Crowdfunder are just a few — waiting for the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to issue final rules later this year. Kickstarter has said it’s not a place to buy things, and it’s not a place to invest in things — it’s a place where fans can support and connect with artists they love. ""Kickstarter won't switch to an equity-based model,"" CEO Yancey Strickler told Popular Science last year. ""We believe the real disruption comes from people supporting things because they like them, rather than finding things that produce a good return on investment."" That attitude suggests companies on track for a mega-exit may seem increasingly out of place on Kickstarter as competitors go after backers who want to make a buck. ""I think [the Oculus acquisition] will change how people look at Kickstarter,"" Belote says. ""If there’s this track record of companies doing really cool things getting acquired early on, it’s sort of like a failure."" Kickstarter declined to comment on the Oculus acquisition. Kickstarter has said it’s not a place to buy things, and it’s not a place to invest in things By contrast, companies getting acquired early on would be winners on equity crowdfunding sites. These sites say they democratize investing, letting the little guy in on the action. Slava Rubin, the CEO of Kickstarter rival Indiegogo, has said he wants to disrupt ""the gatekeeper who decided who gets money."" Indiegogo lobbied for equity crowdfunding and says it will likely be introduced in some form. But the idea that Kickstarter backers could have or should have made money off of the Oculus acquisition is ridiculous, says Mo Koyfman, a partner at Spark Capital, which led Oculus’s first round of investment. Oculus raised money on Kickstarter because it wanted to see if people wanted and would buy the product, and whether developers wanted it and would build games for it. The wildly successful campaign validated that premise, and made it much easier for Oculus to raise money from venture capitalists, he says — but there was no incentive for them to offer equity at that time. ""Just because people say, ‘Well I want equity in this company’ doesn’t mean it’s available,"" Koyfman says. ""I don’t think the Kickstarter backers were backing it because they wanted a financial win … they wanted to try it, wanted to experience it, wanted to see it. They got exactly what they bargained for."" And if Oculus did another Kickstarter campaign for a new headset, it would have no trouble getting funded again, he says. If Oculus did another Kickstarter today for a new headset, it would have no trouble getting funded again In the future, we’re likely to see companies continue to crowdfund for pre-sales the way Oculus did, without offering equity. We will also see companies with less tangible products crowdfund for equity in order to prove out their product before raising serious cash. And we’re likely to see companies do a mix of both — running one campaign on Kickstarter for rewards, and another one on an equity crowdfunding site for stock. The existence of equity crowdfunding doesn’t mean Oculus-style acquisitions will necessarily rain riches on early backers. Some riches are still reserved for the rich.",0.4209184546881423,0.5790815453118576,0.5168717941792212,791,5.1289506953223771,407,6.0147420147420148,0,0,"Business, Culture, Gaming, Report",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

Life today, Nadella said, is ""mobile-first and cloud-first."" As Nadella tells it, Microsoft is uniquely positioned to thrive in that world — because it alone understands the needs of people, their employers, and the developers who build devices for both. ""That’s where we’re headed together,"" he wrote in a blog post after the event. ""Into a world where the devices you love work with the services you love in a way that IT and developers love."" A world where Microsoft can lead again Left unsaid is that the world Nadella describes is also one in which Microsoft, after years of chasing the tectonic shift to mobile devices, can lead again — by helping other businesses navigate the shift to mobile devices that threatened to derail Microsoft itself. Former CEO Steve Ballmer saw Windows as the center of the world, and the story of Microsoft was the operating system’s unstoppable march around the globe. At a small news event in San Francisco today, Nadella formally acknowledged a changed world: one where our computing is more likely to be done on a device made by a competitor than one branded with the Microsoft logo. ""There is no trade-off; it’s reality for us,"" Nadella said as he pledged to bring Microsoft services to customers whatever platform they use. ""What motivates us is the realities of our customers."" Microsoft’s reality check has so far been a hit with investors and consumers, who lit up Twitter in response to the event’s marquee news: the belated arrival of Office for iPad, which brings the company’s iconic productivity suite to tens of millions of Apple users. But the demonstration quickly moved on to products of interest mostly to enterprises and information-technology professionals: Enterprise Mobility Suite, a kind of Facebook Connect for businesses that manages employees’ devices and data access; and (gulp) Microsoft Azure Active Directory Premium, which lets businesses create online portals for employees to download apps for work. And after four years of other developers building productivity tools for tablets, even Office for iPad feels more like an enterprise offering than a consumer one. At $99 a year for access to Office 365, which grants you access to Office applications on any platform you like, the software is positioned as an industrial-grade tool that you’d be unlikely to purchase without a vital business need.  Julia White But in a nod to those ""realities"" Nadella spoke of, you can use Office to read and present your documents for free. ""We want to make sure that everyone can have a taste of what Office is great for, and why people love it,"" said Julia White, Office’s general manager, in an interview with The Verge. ""But we also wanted to add value for our Office 365 subscribers. We felt like that was the right balance."" It’s a move that’s both more practical and more aspirational than we have seen from Microsoft in some time: a vision of a world where Microsoft thrives even when Windows is not at the center of it, and even if its own phones and tablets remain also-rans compared to devices running Android and iOS. Now comes the hard part Microsoft under Nadella appears poised to remain a highly visible consumer brand, driven by customer loyalty to products like Office, Xbox, and Skype. (Next week, at the Build conference, we’ll hear more about the future of Windows — and perhaps more about where Nadella’s strategy leaves Windows 8 and Windows Phone, which can no longer rely on exclusive Office access to lure customers.) Notably, in his first major address as Microsoft’s CEO, Nadella scarcely mentioned any of those things. Instead he focused on Office and enterprise tools, a sign that this company will increasingly make its profits from selling tools to other businesses. There may not be a lot of excitement around ""enterprise mobility,"" but there are significant profits to be made there — and Microsoft, with the products it announced today, is primed to reap them. Nadella appeared calm and smiling throughout the event, and in a further show of confidence, hung out for a few minutes afterward to take questions from journalists. (Most of them wanted to know why Office for iPad had taken so long.) When a reporter asked how all these changes would affect Microsoft’s bottom line, Nadella said he ""would leave it to Wall Street to do the analysis."" But make no mistake — Nadella has already made his analysis. More than its peers, the company’s future lies in the intersection of work and play. And if it’s still not totally clear how Nadella will get Microsoft there, he may have at least identified a winning direction.",0.8459675146815705,0.1540324853184295,0.5150857605139831,800,4.9837499999999997,442,5.9434389140271495,0,0,"Apps, Business, Microsoft, Mobile, Tech, Report",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

But what's really surprising is how they plan to do it. Today, Facebook confirmed rumors that engineers are working on developing a fleet of solar-powered drones that can beam internet access down to people in remote regions of the world. According to today's announcement from Internet.org — the organization that Facebook, Ericsson, Nokia, Qualcomm, Samsung, and others joined last year to help spread internet access — the drones would fly autonomously for months at a time at an altitude of 20,000 meters (roughly 65,000 feet). That's well above commercial airspace, and it's a good spot for the drones because it reduces risks that winds and weather will interfere with flight.   It may sound crazy, but scientists have already made similar solar-powered planes. One, called Solar Impulse, flew nearly 1,000 miles on a single trip, and it's capable of infinite gas mileage. It uses solar panels to charge up during the day, and battery keep it flying at night. To solve the challenges that face the project, Facebook has hired aerospace experts from Ascenta, a company that's built solar-powered drones, as well as others from NASA. It was previously rumored that Facebook acquired another drone company, called Titan Aerospace, but it seems that the talent attached to this project comes from elsewhere. Team hopes to use lasers for high-speed communications between the drones The team is working on coming up with a way to improve data communications through the air. They're developing what's known as free-space optical communication (FSO), and hope to use lasers to send messages between the drones and the ground. If they pull it off, the tech could offer speeds comparable to fiber optic cables. It's not all about drones though. The organization says that in very low density areas, it's working to introduce satellite-based internet that uses the same FSO technology for communication. Bringing internet connectivity to remote regions has long been difficult. The major issue is cost effectiveness: it usually takes land rights and construction to connect an area, and many spots don't have enough users to justify the cost. That's one of the issues that Internet.org and others, like Google through its balloon-based Loon program, are trying to solve. If they can pull it off, the two-thirds of the world without the internet might finally come online.",0.7470841901262016,0.25291580987379836,0.839573686374682,416,5.1802884615384617,262,5.9236641221374047,0,0,"Business, Web",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

An internal team at Google is working on a long-term scientific study of its employees in the hopes of gaining some data-based insight into what makes happy, efficient, and successful employees. The plan is that the study will continue for as long as a century, assuming the company's still around in a hundred years. Google employees struggle with separating their work and social lives, too Laszlo Bock, Google's Senior VP for People Operations, has detailed the study in a guest article for the Harvard Business Review. It's called gDNA, and the plan is to use anonymous surveys of over 4,000 ""Googlers"" to amass some important data points on personalities and attitudes both at home and at work. The study's only in its second year, but Bock says that they've found that most people are either ""segmentors"" or ""integrators."" The former group represents about 31 percent of those surveyed, and they are able to cut off concerns from work and keep them from invading their social lives. The rest are constantly worried about what's happening at work, and over half of them wish they were ""segmentors."" This is a problem that many employers face, and Google's investigating ways of helping its employees out. But as the studies continue, Google hopes it can gain some even deeper insights.

Still on the board is Mozilla co-founder Mitchell Baker, LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, and Spiegel Online's CEO Katharina Borchert, The Journal says. Worries over a donation to Prop 8 Eich co-founded Mozilla and invented JavaScript, though has become the target of scorn from employees who took offense to his alleged $1,000 donation in support of Proposition 8, a California ballot measure from 2008 that banned same-sex marriage. That measure passed, but was later ruled unconstitutional in 2012. Eich acknowledged skepticism about his appointment in a blog post earlier this week, arguing that he was ""committed to ensuring that Mozilla is, and will remain, a place that includes and supports everyone, regardless of sexual orientation, gender identity, age, race, ethnicity, economic status, or religion."" Critics say that stance has come too late. According to The Journal, the former board members were seeking a company outsider to serve as CEO, and the reasoning was not related to the aforementioned donation. Ahead of Eich's new role, the company was relying on Jay Sullivan as acting CEO. Sullivan, who left as part of the shuffle, spent six years at Mozilla and was previously its chief operating officer, a role that's being filled by former Microsoft and Sun Microsystems veteran Li Gong. Update: A previous version of this post characterized Eich's $1000 donation in support of Prop 8 as an investment. That has since been changed.

They had just reached a verdict on what was dubbed by some as “the patent trial of the century,” a fight between Apple and Samsung that was ultimately over the idea of originality. After a three week-long trial that included more than 50 hours of testimony and arguments from both sides, Apple handily beat Samsung, convincing the jurors that Samsung not only copied its technology, but also made billions in the process. Yet, the aftermath of it all didn’t live up to the dramatic ruling. Apple was awarded just over $1 billion in damages, though that figure was later cut down to $939.8 million after the judge pointed out errors in the way the jury did its math. Those damages were retried, and came in lower than the original figure, though the entire amount has since been appealed, and Samsung hasn’t paid a penny. Alongside that, Apple and Samsung failed to win bans against one another’s products in the US, making the first trial seem like nothing more than a legal spectacle. But in the midst of all that was a very real threat: another lawsuit, one that targeted more successful devices from both companies, and used easy-to-understand patents covering basic software features. Apple filed it against Samsung in February 2012, targeting 17 devices. Samsung responded in kind, and this week the pair go head to head once again; the outcome could be very different. Here’s what to expect over the next weeks and months as these two titans clash again in California’s courts. If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it. That seems to be Apple’s motto going into the second trial. Apple is once again pointing to the first iPhone as a game-changer for the world of portable devices, and painting Samsung as a copycat. Just like last time, that involves comparing Samsung’s features to Apple’s, as well as digging up Samsung’s internal documents that spell out the need to emulate Apple. All but one of the Samsung products Apple is targeting are phones. Most of these devices have been retired or are close to it, like the Galaxy S3, which was the hot new product during the first trial and has since been replaced by the S4 and S5. Apple’s main pitch to the jury will continue to be that it took an enormous risk with the first iPhone, and did something that had never been done before. Moreover, Apple will make the case that its inventions came years before the first iPhone went on the market. Timing — the idea of who came up with something first — is a critical part of both that offense and defense, and ultimately what patent cases rely on. But it also helps Apple play to the jury’s emotional side by arguing that it had everything to lose if the iPhone had been a dud. Many of the documents from both sides are sealed going into the trial, meaning we won’t know the specifics until the case gets underway. However, sources familiar with Apple’s legal offense say its filings will describe how Samsung wanted to emulate specific features from the iPhone after the device was already out in public view. Apple did the same thing in the 2012 trial, publishing internal, executive level conversations from Samsung about a ""crisis of design"" for the company’s own products. Apple also brought out an internal Samsung product roadmap mentioning future products that could go head to head with expected devices from Apple, dubbed a ""Beat Apple strategy."" Those documents proved highly successful the last time around, with the jury foreman calling them ""damning"" to Samsung in interviews following the trial. US Patent 5,946,647 — Also known as the ""quick links"" patent, this analyzes text for things like emails and phone numbers and gives you contextual options when you tap them. US Patent 6,847,959 — Universal search, a patent covering search on the device and the internet at the same time. US Patent 7,761,414 — Covers data syncing, particularly data that’s being synced while the user is doing something else. US Patent 8,046,721 — The slide-to-unlock patent gives access to the device when a user swipes their finger across the screen. US Patent 8,074,172 — Keyboard and text ""word suggestions,"" related to autocorrect. Unlike the last trial, which involved design patents and legal rights about the look and feel of the devices, both sides are targeting easy-to-understand software features. Apple’s using five claims, one from each of five different patents, all of which it says were developed while inventing the first iPhone. (The original complaint included three additional patents, which were later dropped.) Of that bunch, the ‘647 patent covering quick links is one of the most notable. Apple successfully used it in legal battles against HTC, forcing the company to create its own workaround before the two settled in 2012. It was also used once again in a spat between Apple and Motorola, a case that was dismissed but could end up in front of the Supreme Court. If Apple had its way the first time around, Samsung would have been on the hook for $2.525 billion and been unable to sell any of its devices in the US. Instead, the final damages number ended up being less than half that, and the company failed to get any sort of permanent bans on Samsung products. This time around, Apple’s asking for damages between $33 and $40 per device, for what could be tens of millions of Samsung devices.That puts the total damages amount around $2 billion, which would still be less than the target number from the first trial. In the first trial, Samsung played up its innocence by suggesting Apple was a bully, one that was unwilling to license its patents, and instead sought to stifle competition. Moreover, Samsung said any similarities its phones and tablets had with Apple’s products was the standard operating procedure in the electronics industry, something called ""benchmarking."" The jury didn’t buy that, but Samsung’s still arguing those two points. When this lawsuit was originally filed, some of these products were not even released, but a lot changes in two years. The final tally of products includes a mix of old and new, though more than half of these are no longer sold by Apple directly. What’s new is the addition of Google, which Samsung says independently developed many of the software features Apple has accused it of copying. These are Android features on trial, not just the look and feel of Samsung’s devices and software. That’s a big difference from the first trial, where Google’s Android was the elephant in the room. Now, several Googlers, including senior vice president Andy Rubin, Hiroshi Lockheimer (VP of Android engineering), and Kenzo Fong Hing (head of Android marketing) could be called up to the witness stand to explain how those features were created. Despite that, Google is not directly involved in the case as a defendant alongside Samsung, and Apple is referring to Google simply as a vendor. Making matters more interesting this time is the recently formed alliance between Google and Samsung, which signed a broad cross-licensing agreement for one another’s patents in January. Samsung’s also arguing against the amount of money Apple wants in damages. This isn’t a surprise given what Apple’s asking, which ranges between $33 to $40 per device, for features covered in those five patents. Samsung will once again try to paint the picture that a smartphone is made up of thousands of features, and hundreds of thousands of patents, and that the patents Apple is using do not make up core features. ""Apple is not asserting patents that make the phone transmit data, or make phone calls, or access the internet — they’re stylistic glosses on top of the underlying technology,"" says Brian J. Love, an assistant professor at the Santa Clara University School of Law. ""I think it’s hard to make the argument that those patents are worth hundreds of thousands of times their value."" Samsung plans to back up that idea by highlighting inconsistencies with Apple’s own licensing-fee structures, specifically in the legal battle the iPhone-maker had with Motorola two years ago. In a January hearing about the case, Samsung noted that Apple was asking for 60 cents a device for the quick-links patent, whereas in this one it’s asking for $12.49 a device. US Patent 6,226,449 — Covers camera and folder organization; basically the ""gallery"" feature you’d find on your phone or tablet. US Patent 5,579,239 — Video-transmission function and compression. Samsung is using this to target Apple’s FaceTime. Samsung is only using two of its patents in this case, but is wielding them against every Apple device running iOS between 2010 and the end of 2012. The two patents cover a photo-gallery feature and video compression technology. (There were originally two other patents at play covering standard essential wireless data transfers, but those were dropped from the case earlier this month.) Apple plans to attack Samsung over the two patents, saying the South Korean company didn’t even own them until the first lawsuit was filed, and instead shopped for them to go on the offensive. That includes the gallery patent that was formerly owned by Hitachi, and the video transmission patent, which was created by a group of inventors from Oklahoma in 1994. In the first trial, Samsung asked the jury to award it $421.8 million in damages. This time it’s asking for a little more than $6.9 million ($6,780,329 for the ‘239 patent and $158,400 for the ‘449 patent), according to court documents seen by The Verge. Additionally, if the jury agrees that those Apple devices were infringing, Samsung could seek sales bans. It’s hard not to view this as one big replay of the first trial, and one that’s less groundbreaking. Both sides are making nearly identical arguments; just about the only thing that’s changed are the patents and some of the products. This case, like the first, continues to be a perfect example of the legal system being slower than the speed at which technology products like smartphones and tablets are moving. As a result, even if there are bans, many of these products are no longer on sale, putting more of the focus on the theoretical lost profits and royalty rates that could have come out of these deals. Even with seemingly massive dollar figures at stake on both sides, the true nature of the case has been the rivalry between these two companies. It’s been a place for Apple to use Samsung as an example in order to strike fear into the hearts of competitors. Likewise, Samsung’s used its enormous size, market share, and breadth of products to take those threats head on, pushing back and trying to make Apple look like a follower of other companies that were making phones long before it. The jury didn’t buy that in 2012, but now that Android is more directly in Apple's crosshairs, maybe Google will help Samsung get the jury to think different this time around.",0.5113810548251144,0.4886189451748856,0.8605001365696928,1884,4.9570063694267512,793,6.3127364438839848,0,0,,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

Despite the fact that Musk has steadfastly defended the safety of his vehicle, the company has announced a fix for the cause of the reported fires. In a post on Medium, Musk details a new titanium shield and aluminum deflector plates that protect the underbody of the vehicle — all cars produced after March 6th will have this new safety system in place, and existing vehicles can have it added free of charge.  ""There is no safer car on the road than a Tesla."" This should fix the cause of previous Tesla fires — in those collisions, the shield protecting the battery was compromised when the cars struck metallic objects in the road at high speed. Now, in addition to ""existing quarter inch of ballistic grade aluminum armor plate that already protects the battery pack,"" the Model S will have another protective layer in place. In conjunction with this new fix, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has announced that it is closing its investigation into the Model S fires, reports the AP. Musk says that the company tested the new protective shield 152 times, hitting objects like a concrete block, a steel alternator, and a three-tow hitch, none of which caused any damage to the car. The added weight of this new safety system shouldn't affect the car's longevity — Musk says it'll only have a 0.1 percent impact on the vehicle's range.

The public has to pay for the new funds The amount of funding that will actually be disbursed depends on the demand from schools and libraries, and the commission is trying to make it somewhat easier for those funds to be requested. The fund doesn't cover the entire expense of buying and installing new equipment, however it will provide more money to schools and libraries that are located in rural areas or areas with more poverty. The commission notes that the funding will likely ramp up toward the spending cap, suggesting it may not be met immediately. The E-rate program is funded by a small tax called the Universal Service Fund that's added onto everyone's phone bill, so this adjusted spending cap will mean higher fees. Those fees shouldn't be substantial, however. Even if the $3.9 billion cap is hit, the commission says that people will only be paying around 16 cents more per phone line per month, totaling $1.90 more for a single line each year. Republicans on the commission voted against the plan, denouncing it as a wasteful tax increase. ""I am aghast at the hostility that is expressed to giving students the tools they need to get a 21st century education,"" commission chairman Tom Wheeler says, according to The New York Times. In a statement, the commission says that it believes the small tax increase is far outweighed by the benefits the program can bring to education.",0.5970709637740765,0.40292903622592346,0.8405862882924487,355,5.0676056338028168,215,5.8651162790697677,0,0,"Policy & Law, Tech, US & World",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

This smartphone-based license will likewise be accepted for police stops and at airports in the state. It's certainly an intriguing, forward-thinking option, but it's also questionable how practical it'll be when it launches.

A comment from one of the participants in the UK’s first ever face-sitting protest sets the tone for the afternoon. It’s a first for all involved, with 21 pairs of face-sitters and face-sittees gathered outside the Houses of Parliament to protest against the introduction of new porn censorship laws. Activities like female ejaculation, spanking, caning, fisting, and — yes — face-sitting are all being subjected to new restrictions, with regulator ATVOD (the Authority for Television on Demand) calling for strict guidelines that bring the laws for adult video-on-demand sites in line with those for R18 DVDs sold in licensed sex shops. ATVOD says it's merely ironing out ""a regulatory inconsistency,"" but the protesters say it’s censorship. ""Can anyone define ‘aggressive whipping’? If I'm whipping you with a smile on my face, do I look aggressive?"" ""The government  claims that this law is needed to ensure consistency, but who do they think they are in taking our rights away to view legal and consensual sex online?"" says Charlotte Rose, the protest’s organizer, a sexual rights campaigner, and Sex Worker of the Year 2013. ""Can anyone define ‘aggressive whipping’? If I'm whipping you with a smile on my face, do I look aggressive?"" For regulators and protestors alike, the devil’s in the details. Myles Jackman, a lawyer specializing in obscenity and pornography who supports the protest, points out that it's a bureaucratic nightmare. For example, under the new regulations, porn involving ""purpose-designed fucking-machines"" is acceptable, the use of standard power tools is not ""since most people have one lying around at home."" Similar caveats are being applied to fisting (okay ‘up to the last knuckle’) and female ejaculation (""acceptable if not performed onto another person and/or then consumed""), with regulators saying they’re only worried about porn consumers copying these acts and hurting themselves. Pete Johnson, chief executive of ATVOD, says that he blames ""grossly inaccurate accounts"" of the new law for the outrage, with some articles from the UK media falsely describing the acts affected as being ""outlawed outright."" ""There is no ban on face sitting,"" Johnson tells The Verge. ""What there is, is a concern on a deliberate focus on the restriction of blood or oxygen to the brain because its potentially fatal."" He’s also keen to stress that there’s no gender bias or ""bias against activities associated with particular sexual preferences."" However, this is a difficult line to take, especially when comparing the restrictions placed on the depiction of female ejaculation and the freedom concerning male ejaculation (consuming this ejaculate is okay). ATVOD says it's because it can’t draw the line between female ejaculation and urination, but the protestors say it's an attack on female sexual agency regardless. Regulators say porn can't look dangerous - protesters say that's what makes it porn Although the popular line taken by some protesters — that politicians are trying to make everyone as sexually repressed as they are — is unconvincing, many participating in the mass face-sitting note that the appearance of danger is sometimes integral to this type of pornography. ""I think that part of the point of that type of image is that it has to look like someone’s maybe in peril and is being dominated,"" says Sebastian Bird, a software developer and self-described submissive who came out to protest. ""One of the reasons given [for the law] is to protect children or young people from porn, but they’re not actually targeting the free sources of porn these children are all watching: the tube sites."" For protest organizer Rose, though, even partial restrictions are censorship enough. ""This is absolutely ludicrous that this was done secretly behind closed doors without the public being aware,"" she shouts from the steps of a historic monument, surrounded by a huge press scrum. ""Did I consent to this? Did you consent to this? This affects our sexual freedom. The freedom to express yourself in the things we enjoy and consent to."" After the speeches, Rose corrals the crowd, lining up participants and making sure there are yoga mats and blankets for all on the cold paving stones. Everyone is laughing and smiling as they pair up, some posing for the cameras and others for selfies. An onlooker shouts ""For the love of God, someone sit on that poor fella's face!"" as the last couples arrange themselves. Finally, the hymn sheets are handed out and a rousing rendition of Monty Python's ""Sit on my Face"" begins. Some of the voices are a little muffled — but at least they're being heard.

That book, written by Mark Danielewski, wove multiple narratives, hundreds of footnotes, and detailed appendices into a layout as dizzying as the haunted, shape-shifting house that House of Leaves was about. His follow-up, Only Revolutions, was a road novel of sorts that followed a traveling teenage couple. Its ""hook"" was that it told both characters' accounts concurrently on the opposite sides of a given page, and you had to flip the book every eight pages to keep things straight. Danielewski followed that with The Fifty Year Sword, which bounced between five narrators.    If you're looking for a light summer read, these books are not for you.   Neither is his next one — or, more accurately, ones. Released last month, the first volume of The Familiar is, in many ways, exactly what it had always been rumored to be: a ""story about a 12-year-old girl who finds a kitten."" In truth, it's much more than that, because the story of The Familiar will be told over 27 volumes.  In the first volume, Danielewski tells the story of ""one rainy day in May"" (this volume's subtitle) from the perspective of nine different characters around the globe. Three of those nine characters belong to the same family and serve as de facto main characters: the mother (Astair), the father (Anwar), and their daughter (Xanther, the 12-year-old girl).   A page from one of Cas' chapters. The narratives occupy chapters with pages that are color-coded in the corners, and each character's story is presented in a unique style. For example, the story of an LAPD detective is told with half-empty pages that resemble police paperwork. The story of Cas, a hacker type who is on the lam when we meet her, is told in such a way that its text (and the negative space it creates) forms a circle on the page, a constant reminder of the mysterious electrical orb she carries with her. Astair's story is told more traditionally but uses (likely over-uses, for some people's tastes) parentheses to translate the myriad thoughts running through her mind at all moments (like why Xanther started having seizures again (or why they even stopped in the first place (how will her younger sisters handle it? (and where are Anwar and Xanther anyway, they should be back from the pet store by now! ) ) ) ).  (Get it?)   By the end of 800 pages the needle of these stories doesn't move terribly far — it is, again, only about one rainy day in May. But what The Familiar does (wonderfully) is build the groundwork for each character, setting up for what's to come. Now it just needs an audience.   Mark Danielewski joined me by phone to talk about what goes in to a project of this size, what it's like to spend a decade working on it, and even the possibility of a House of Leaves movie.  Sean O'Kane: So there’s a lot going on in first volume of The Familiar that feels well-researched. You cover everything from coding language, to the behavior of LA gangs, to specific video game writers and whether or not they’d make good hires. Obviously you had a lot of time, but where does all that come from?  Mark Danielewski: A lot of living. A lot of it is research, and a lot of it is getting out of the house, getting out of the fast lane and actually just taking one of those strange exits and sitting down somewhere. For me, it involved going to Singapore, it involved talking to East LA gang members. I’ve always had an interest in technology, so just being open to those conversations with engineers, designers. And you know, making a commitment to this project over nine years ago, and at that moment, even though a lot changed, being open to what would come my way. Whether it was numerous conversations with Armenian cab drivers in Los Angeles, or actually sitting down with LAPD detectives a bunch of times in that interrogation room that you see on so many television shows and movies; sort of soaking in that environment. Does that make it hard to know whether or not something belongs in the purview of what The Familiar is going to be, or what it is?  Yeah, and I think that’s where it moves beyond just writing into a more vocational way of living. It encourages a practice of being open, of listening, and most of all finding a way of being comfortable about being uncertain, because it’s impossible to tell at a certain moment. Now and then you get these little gems, but often things that suddenly are important aren’t recognized as being important until maybe even a couple of years later. Say you had a moment, and you were open to the vitality of the story that was being told, the word that was being conveyed, but you didn’t necessarily place it somewhere, and nonetheless, two rewrites later, suddenly this moment comes to life, and that’s how it happens. I think the thing is you don’t want to over-insist, either. I’ve practiced tai-chi for a number of years — I consider myself a very good beginner [laughs] — but one of the phrases I’ve always loved is ""four ounces of pressure."" That’s all you need. If you’re positioned right, if you’ve practiced the form right, you in theory don’t need more than those four ounces. And I think the same way goes with the experience of writing this book. There are moments to exert pressure, but then there are moments to let that pressure pass through you. Because of its scope, and because of the amount of time that’s gone into it, the weight of it is this accretion of just smaller details. Pixels, fractals, building up into this rainstorm. That’s what I really loved about where Volume 1 ended, and the ride along the way. It’s a different tone, but it reminds me of the HBO show Treme, which is really about these little details of different lives, and whether or not they ever cross isn’t really the point.  One of the questions that I got at a reading last night was, ""How do you know it’s 27 volumes? How do you know it’s that long?"" And without getting into specifics of the number, the point is that at a certain moment this novel settled into the voice of those narratives that are concerned more with the lives of the characters — the life of the mind of those characters — than simply chewing through story. Treme I haven’t watched, but I’m looking forward to [it]. But certainly one can think of like, The Wire, which is similar in the way it just slowly builds up this sense of the city, and the sense of the individuals that live there. It’s not about rapidly moving through plot. And once I realized that that was really where these characters lived, and how this story would unfold, then it became tied to a different pace, a different tempo. I love when a space is kind of opened up. And that happens a lot with novels. People have begun to sort of expect novels to be around 300 pages, and to be paced accordingly. It’s important to keep pushing into new spaces.   A page from one of Xanther's chapters. I remember at a reading in 2006 you talked about how, to make Only Revolutions, you were laying out giant versions of the pages on your floor. Was anything like that done for The Familiar? Or was it a more traditional process?  No definitely not. [Laughs] I’m trying to tease on what the image would be but, Only Revolutions was so unto itself, the story of two gods who were very much oblivious of the world around them, and we were literally following them on their ego trip. When I was done with that I said to myself, ""I never want to pass this way again."" This was an experience that was too closed off, and despite being a study of the cost of narcissism it also inflicted in some ways those costs upon me. So I really wanted to open the windows and the doors, and that involved letting more and more people into this. We just finished Volume 2 [of The Familiar], and there is now this kind of informal [production company] Atelier Z where where people are really working. The entire act structure of Volume 2 is mapped out, all the graphics were being tracked. We had various walls pinned with the chapter splash pages, tracing the graphics, the rainstorm, seeing the progression of how the words were being incorporated into those designs, what those words were. It took a long time to figure out what the dog ears were going to be for each character, and sort of studying the characters on a textual level. And also discussing the parameters of what their colors would be, and how that would play out. And this is the part that was so difficult — not just in Volume 1, which now seems easy — but how is the cover design, how are those dog ear designs, how is all of it going to play out over 27 volumes? But I really enjoyed that collaborative element, and even though I was constantly writing the book on my own, the ability to, in these 10 or 12 hour days, to shift gears for a couple of hours and step in as a kind of art director to work on certain chapters and certain visual ideas was thrilling for me. And some of it comes down to a lifestyle in some ways; you’re doing this work but at the same time you can reward yourself with a night out of good pizza and bowling, and find yourself in conversations about other projects that people are involved in. Whether you like Only Revolutions or not, it’s so of itself and unto itself it really doesn’t care if anyone likes it or not. Whereas this book, the reader is very much like Xanther in scooping up this very fragile thing that may or may not be alive, that may or may not have a future, but has somehow called itself into existence, and into an existence that depends wholly on the rescuing hands of the future. It’s almost, to me, opposite of House of Leaves, which had this almost mythical quality to it. It didn’t need readers, it was going to exist no matter what. But I know you’ve said in other interviews how The Familiar needs acceptance early on for the whole thing to continue.  House of Leaves is a different beast. It also finishes itself. But I wouldn’t even say that I’m the authority on the experience of [The Familiar] because I can’t really imagine Volume 1 just as Volume 1. I mean, Volume 2 is finished, 10 have been written. The universe of these characters sort of swims through my mind in a sort of holographic way. It’s funny because I do know the book well enough to know that it doesn’t depend on everyone, it isn’t going to be for everyone. But it will be for those readers who enjoy the many layers, enjoy talking about the many layers. I think there’s a lot to be had about discussing the book’s connectivity, and that certainly would be the greatest success for me, if it did kind of encourage that kind of conversation. You say you’ve had more help on this than previous works. Does it ever feel like you’re in the cast of a movie series like The Avengers, thinking ""Oh man, why did I sign up for six of these? We couldn’t have done three and then an option?""  Well I can’t say what my publisher feels like, because they know as little as I do. [Laughs] And that’s the exciting part, because we really don’t know how this is going to come to life. In that sense it’s terrifying for a big company, but at the same time it’s also exciting because it’s something new. And in terms of the people that work with me, it’s not a cage. The windows are always open, the doors open — it’s not a career. So the only one that’s really signed up for those many, many volumes is the guy you’re talking to. And it can feel like an extraordinary long and liberating journey, and at times it can also feel like a punishing cage. I think if you’re willing to raise your head and extract yourself from the immediate distractions of the day-to-day, you realize that life is like that, too. In some sense, we’re lucky to walk the path as long as we walk. And at the same time, that can be bewildering if we find ourselves in moments of pain or unhappiness. For me, the book is life, and my life is the book. I have to make peace with that, and I do. Every, every day. I can only imagine, even with respective successes in the past, there being apprehension when you bring an idea like this to the table with a publisher. But it’s also a publisher you’ve worked with, so there must be some familiarity and trust where they’re willing to go into a project of this scope, right?  You nailed it, and in fact I feel incredibly fortunate. I’m lucky to be working many of the same people that I worked on House of Leaves with. I happen to also have landed at the best place for this kind of stuff. [My publisher] Pantheon is incredible in doing graphic novels, and so they have an intense, intimate familiarity with not only printing elaborate, very color-specific, design-specific pieces, but as well as transferring it to an electronic platform. As you know, technology is constantly altering, so it’s difficult to find that one electronic design that can seamlessly move across various platforms, but Pantheon is invested in that and it’s exciting. For me, the ur-form is really the book, the codex in your hands. Mark Danielewski photographed by Emman Montalvan.   This is the second book of yours to have an e-version, right? The Fifty Year Sword was the first?    Yeah, and because [The Fifty Year Sword] was so much smaller it was a real opportunity to kind of explore that. And actually it came with a lot of warnings, for me, because we did some animations, we included original music, and it was an enormous amount of work. I started to realize that in many ways it’s a different profession. For this one, because it was coming out simultaneously, there were certain limits on what we could do, and the point was just to represent it as clearly as possible. The e-version of Only Revolutions will be coming out in late summer, and that comes complete with original music, over 300 road signs to help you along the way, and in many ways it’s presenting a book that’s not like the three-dimensional printed version. But it takes advantage of how one could read that book differently. House of Leaves we would like to do, but it’s an even bigger project, so that will probably come later. But we’re angling toward it. Even 10 years ago I remember arguments raged about whether part, or all, of House of Leaves should be made into a film. As you transition some of these works in different media, is there a line you know you wouldn’t push it past?  Not really. I certainly have laid down my own ""nevers"" early on and I pretty much stuck to that. There was always interest into turning House of Leaves into a movie. I think I’m at the point where, to be involved with a corporation like a studio that wanted to buy something, for me it just looks like a mess. If David Fincher or P.T. Anderson came to me and said, ""Hey, I’ve read your book and I really want to talk about it,"" am I going to have that conversation? Absolutely. But that’s not something that’s, right now, on the horizon. I think the biggest thing — and it’s not really a negative — is that I’m committed to this project, and this project takes up almost every moment of my free time. To suddenly do something else, which would require ample amount of time, is simply not available to me. I don’t have the resources to do that. I’m with Xanther and her family, and that’s where I’m going to stay.",0.6404180796704915,0.35958192032950853,0.1456975720023966,2842,4.4982406755805773,1061,6.1394910461828465,0,16,"Culture, Entertainment, Interview",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

The new show is called Degrassi: Next Class, and it's supposed to arrive on Netflix in early 2016. Aside from Canada, Australia, and France, Netflix will be the exclusive home of Next Class. In Canada, it'll be carried on Family.  It's exclusive to Netflix in most locations There aren't a lot of details yet, but Family says that a number of existing cast members will be returning. If we're very lucky, maybe Netflix will dig deep into its pockets to get a cameo from Drake. Next Class is being targeted to the same age group that Degrassi has always gone after, but that age group is comprised of a new audience at this point, as the producers behind the show point out. They say they're now looking to ""tell stories for the new post-millennial teen cohort known as Generation Z, most of whom weren't even born when Degrassi returned in 2001.""

It's coming out later in June, and Apple doesn't have it on display here at WWDC — in fact, Apple doesn't have any of its new software on display here. Instead, it's taking some journalists into a quiet, chill sort of lounge to get a chance to play around with the new app. We couldn't take photos or video, probably because some of the corners of the app like BeatsOne Radio weren't operational yet. But what I did see was a mostly functional and mostly straightforward music streaming app. I often get caught saying that a particular app or technology is boring, but that's okay — sometimes boring means reliable, predictable, and easy-to-understand. That definitely applies to Apple Music, which despite Apple's protestations is a streaming service amongst a large and growing set of other streaming services, virtually a commodity. But it's a good one. Apple Music is the guy you've been dating awhile getting a new haircut that's pretty good. He's growing a bit of a belly and constantly wearing a hoodie but he'll be good to you and sometimes there will be flashes of brilliance that remind you why you loved him in the first place. Except sometimes he drives you crazy by putting your favorite stuff in a random drawer. Apple really wants you to pay attention to three main areas in its new music app. The first, and the first tab, is called ""For You."" This is where Apple sticks its recommendations: artists it thinks you'll like as well as playlists created and curated by its human employees (the humanity of said curators is an important feature, Apple says). In the demo I saw, there was a healthy mix of Springsteen and Pharrell (it was based on Eddy Cue's keynote preferences, you see), and you could tap into either to see a bigger list of songs or more information on the artist. The layout was fast and fluid, though there are little three-dot menus littering nearly every possible element on the screen. That's probably inevitable with any full-featured music app, but maybe someday Apple could hide that stuff under a Force Press. Also, the kinds of lists offered up in ""For You"" that I saw were strictly limited to what I mentioned above: there's no Songza-style ""Music for making a spaghetti dinner"" or ""music to get you up in the morning"" like you'll see on other services. The next tab is simply called ""New"" and it has new artists and such. Apple's persistent theme this WWDC is that it's not creepily looking at your data, and thus I was told what shows up in this New tab is just new stuff that Apple's curators like, not stuff that's customized to you (that stuff hangs out in the earlier tab). Next is Radio. This was a little confusing, but here's the deal: BeatsOne isn't launched yet but will offer commercial free music with real DJs available to everybody, whether or not you subscribe to Music. I asked about whether Apple ever intended to make money off of it by selling ads and, well, I didn't get a very clear answer — but given the size of Apple's bank account, I suppose the company can afford to be vague. Underneath BeatsOne there are a bunch of iTunes Radio stations, curated as before — and if you subscribe, they're ad free. Then there's Connect and it's weird. It's like a little half-baked music Tumblr inside an app, complete with likes, comments, and share counts. Apple reps told me that to publish to this funny little almost-but-not-really social network, music artists will need to apply for access and be vetted, much in the way that indies get on to the iTunes Store. Here, I saw well-crafted photos, videos, and random posts from well-known artists. There were follow buttons for those artists and, in theory, comments on each post (but comments weren't working yet). Apple reps told me that you can share content from this little social zone on the web or anywhere else — it doesn't require the Music app to view it. It ticks up a counter for each ""successful share,"" and so far as I can tell, what counts as a ""successful share"" is ""you tapped the share button and then you tapped an icon in the share sheet,"" so that will probably be gamed. Or maybe it won't, because it's super hard to know whether Connect will feel like a vibrant, interesting place where you can exercise your music fandom by getting more real and direct stuff from the artists you like or... another Ping. It certainly seems like Tumblr-lite, but maybe that's enough. Last, and apparently least, is the ""My Music"" tab. This is where all of your library, playlists, and other traditional iTunes stuff lives. Essentially, the work that was handled by multiple tables in the old Music app have all been collapsed into one here. Some people might gripe about that, but not me: If you're going to dive into streaming, dive into streaming. Plus, I usually like having my most-accessed app on the lower-right anyway. One thing that's hidden away is music videos, which is weird! It's actually a big deal that you can stream these without ads, and Apple could have stood to foreground them more. But woe unto whoever wants to reliably find them — you need to either get to an artist page or figure out where the top charts are located (New -> Scroll down -> find the ""All Top Charts"" button -> Tap Video). I also tried out Siri a bit. After figuring out that Siri couldn't distinguish between a personal playlist and one that Apple made (""Backyard BBQ""), I moved on to just throwing searches at it. For the most part, everything worked: naming a band, asking for a playlist, and so on. You still can't ask Siri to come up with mood music for you (which is really starting to feel like a gap), but it's way faster and better at hunting stuff down that's already in your library. And that's... that's it! It's $9.99 per month ($14.99 for families), and it's coming to Android and Windows, too. Apple Music is fast, mostly-coherently designed, and still has a few bugs to work out. It's not significantly better or worse than Spotify — or Tidal, or Rdio, or Google Play Music, for that matter. But that's the advantage of controlling the platform for Apple: it really doesn't need to be significantly better. It just has to be good enough, have a large enough library, and feel comfortable enough for the wide swath of people that use it. If it feels advanced enough for millennials but still gives us olds our files and our iTunes — and it does all those things — we'll probably stick with it. Even if it does hide our favorite stuff in random drawers sometimes.

The Internet revolutionized the world, but it also left it vulnerable to attack. With the help of VERA, the last surviving cyberbeing from the original Guardian Program, our heroes stream into cyberspace where they use their awesome code-based powers to battle viruses that have been unleashed by a ruthless hacker. Known only as the Sourcerer, he seeks to rule the world by controlling cyberspace. Original fans of the show will be happy to hear that Megabyte will be back and he's getting a major upgrade. ReBoot will showcase leading edge technologies and bring coding into the mainstream for kids. The ReBoot reboot is designed to ""to drive a new type of relationship across multiple platforms"" and cooperate with ""associated brand extensions [to] deliver mass appeal with a technology focus."" I remain hopeful that this announcement is directed toward potential business partners and board members, and not people who have some bizarre affection for the original show (This guy!).

It was meant to illustrate how their new service fits into the history of humans and our relationship to music — from the good old days when we all gathered ‘round the victrola to listen to the latest ragtime joint, to modern times when we all gather round the DJ booth to hop up and down to the latest bleep bloops. And that's where Apple Music comes in!  Apple Music wants to be your one-stop-shop for every level of your musical consumption — whether that's discovering music via trusted curators (BeatsOne radio), getting it directly from artists you already like (Connect), or through algorithms that figure out what you want to listen to so you don't have to. Gone are the days when you have to toggle awkwardly between a Spotify playlist and your personal collection of music files. Now, ostensibly, they will all be a part of the same app, and not just any app — an app connected to the most dominant, effortless music store on the planet. The barrier between streaming and purchasing will be lower than ever. If you have an iPhone and are already a paid Spotify user, I can't think of a single reason why you would stick with the service after June 30th. iTunes was the first digital Case Logic binder Jimmy Iovine, Eddy Cue, or Drake didn't say anything today about buying albums, and the notion that streaming services serve any kind of sizeable ""try before you buy"" function has long since been debunked. We can assume that the iTunes Store isn't going anywhere, but the innovation of Apple Music — and any of the competitors it's now jumping into the ring with — is not to have to choose which albums you own and don't own. If nothing else, it's evidence of Apple's adaptability, because the original iTunes application started out as a kind of digital intermediary between the era of lovingly organizing your record collection along the wall, and downloading literally every album you could think of off Napster. You could scroll through your friend's iTunes library and the experience was an obvious analog (perhaps that's not the best word) to flipping through their giant 208-disc Case Logic binder. If you grew up with that idea of personal collection and curation, you knew how pivotal it could be for building your personal identity. Everyone had a music collection — whether in files or on vinyl — and the size and nature of it said something important about you. I remember staring with dissatisfaction at my modest CD collection (music was expensive back then! Much more than $9.99 a month) at various stages throughout my adolescence, thinking it was alternately ""too pop,"" ""too rock,"" ""too novelty,"" or the unbearable ""too mainstream."" Later into college it frequently risked being ""too pirated"" — I preferred having that original album art to slide into each sleeve, rather than an ugly Memorex CD-R with some Sharpie writing on it, but sometimes convenience won out. This isn't another piece about how it feels so good to put a needle on a record and hold an album in your hands and feel Jack White or whoever's beating heart through the warmth of the vinyl. When I got my first iPod (which had my entire music library on its 60 GB, and which definitely was ""too pirated"") I still took pride in spinning through that impossibly huge artist list and feeling a sense of pride at my vast yet still somehow specific musical taste. This is about the idea of owning the things you like and taking care of them and investing some part of your identity in them. Buying records was a very brief obsession in the history of humans and music Because if you grew up with that idea of collection and curation, you were actually a part of a very brief era in how humans do music. As much as we like to think of them as some vital part of our heritage, record stores really only enjoyed a heyday of about a half a century. Prior to that, music was less a market of things to acquire and more a substance that flowed out of every car speaker and jukebox. And before that, it was something you played with friends after dinner, in the parlor or around the campfire. Our oldest musical traditions, like sacred and folk music, were important because they were an experience people could share, not a way to differentiate one's self. When all we had was hymns, you weren't going to turn up your nose at a song because everyone else was singing it; you were just stoked because everyone else knew the same song you knew and you weren't alone in the universe. Individual taste has been around as long as we've had our five senses, but it didn't manifest itself as choice-based consumer activity until about halfway through the 20th century. Which brings me back to the Inspirational Apple Promo: in a way, the shot of the millennials raging at the EDM show has more in common with dust bowlers gathering 'round for some radio time than it does with the guys blasting the latest track out of their souped-up subwoofers. People who pay hundreds of dollars to attend one of an ever-growing number of big electronic music festivals aren't going so much for a predetermined song or artist or moment so much as to be submerged in a kind of music, a kind of activity, for an extended period of time, and with people who are all having the same experience at the same time. Fans like this are as likely to build a playlist of their favorite dance anthems as to just search YouTube for one of many thousands of three-hour ""Trance megamixes."" Music as a substance: open the spigot and get your fill. And hopefully, feel less alone. So perhaps Apple Music's egoless combo is more timeless than it seems on the surface, give or take some modern conveniences: We'll have access to everything, but it will be curated and filtered by third parties and algorithms and our own personal playlists so as not to overwhelm our poor little info-saturated brains. (I've said it before and I'll say it again: radio will never die, and Apple making such an investment in BeatsOne seems like further evidence of that — some deep down part of us LOVES the simplicity of being told what to listen to!) The question of what you own will be taken out of the equation; all we really have to do is some arranging and prioritizing to optimize the flow of content. We won't define ourselves by our music, because everyone will be varying flavors of musical omnivore. Apple has created a self-contained musical Truman Show    The only place where I really pause then, is the notion of all of it — every level of our music experience — being chaperoned by a single company. With Connect essentially asking musicians to move all their social media and marketing content to the same platform they sell music on, the legwork of being a fan — of a specific artist or a genre — has been reduced to zero. And all the while, our patterns of consumption are all being fed back to Apple HQ. Apple's asking us to consolidate everything about how we do music to a kind of self-contained Truman Show, where we have everything we could ever want and the freedom to integrate it into our lives in a way that feels specific and personal. But if we ever so much as think about trying to operate past the confines of its dome, it will immediately be apparent how reliant we are on them for everything. It might be really good for us in the long run to revert to a more global, holistic approach to how we do music, as nostalgic as I am for my old CD towers. But then the collection fetish has just moved upstairs — from the customers, to the corporate bodies that gather them up like so many stacks of used discs. Maybe the nostalgia we feel won't be so much for the records and files themselves, but for the diversity of experiences that brought them to us.",0.5918196226338801,0.4081803773661199,0.18457018842855896,1404,4.5961538461538458,632,5.9905063291139244,1,0,"Apple, Culture, Entertainment, Tech, WWDC 2015, Music",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

The outages appeared limited to services related to Apple's online storefronts, but ""limited"" here is a relative term as many popular services are apparently tied in: Apple Music, Apple Radio, the App Store, Apple TV, the Mac App Store, iTunes Match, and even OS X Software Update all suffered problems. The outage wasn't universal, but still proved an unexpected headache for users. The good news is that plenty of other Apple cloud services remainedl up and running: Maps, iCloud Drive, iMessage, and Siri held steady the whole time. We don't know for sure whether or not the outages were related to the VMA nominations, but it's hard not to point out the coincidence. If traffic from the VMAs caused the issues, it's weird to think that Apple's services wouldn't be able to stand up to it — presumably it had plenty of traffic for its services when it first launched Apple Music.

The write down pushed Microsoft's losses to $2.1 billion for the quarter. Excluding the write down and related charges, Microsoft's other businesses earned a profit of $6.4 billion on $22.2 billion in revenue. The company notes that its revenue from Windows OEMs declined 22 percent due to cutting off support for Windows XP, but revenue from Microsoft's own Surface line grew 117 percent to $888 million on the backs of strong sales of the Surface Pro 3 and newer Surface 3. Microsoft's smartphone business actually grew 10 percent year over year to 8.4 million units, but lower average selling prices led to a revenue decline of 68 percent. The Xbox division managed to expand sales by 30 percent to 1.4 million for the quarter, however. In more positive news, Microsoft's Office 365 subscriber base increased to 15 million, up nearly 3 million from the prior quarter. Margins also increased dramatically year over year, up to 26 percent from 17 percent for the same period last year.  All eyes are now on the Windows 10 launch next week Looking forward, all eyes are on Windows 10, which launches officially next week. Microsoft has been in a transition period all year, as CEO Satya Nadella has made big changes to the company's structure and overall mission. The head of Windows, Terry Myerson, was recently put in charge of all of Microsoft's device business, filling the gaps left by Stephen Elop and Jo Harlow, both of whom recently left the company. Just today, a report from ZDNet says that Surface boss Panos Panay is being put in charge of engineering for the Premium Devices division under Myerson, which covers things like Surface, smartphones, Xbox, the Band fitness device, and the HoloLens augmented reality device. By all accounts, it doesn't look like Windows 10 will be the mess that was Windows 8, but Microsoft will have to execute a flawless launch in order to really reap the benefits of the new platform in its business. The write down of the the Nokia assets came with massive cuts to the flailing smartphone business, and it's not clear how much longer Microsoft will subsidize it and keep it in its portfolio. For now, the company has pointed to the fall for new Windows 10 smartphones, which is when the platform will officially launch on mobile handsets. Beyond that, however, is anyone's guess.

But the worst change affects customers who sign up for AT&T's Next plan on or after August 1st. Like other carriers, AT&T's upgrade-when-you-want installment plan has allowed consumers to get started with $0 down and no hidden activation, financing, or upgrade fees. Unfortunately, that won't be the case much longer. Starting on the 1st, AT&T will charge all new Next customers a $15 activation fee whenever they get a new phone. That same $15 rate applies if you bring your own smartphone compatible with AT&T's network and start a new, contract-free line of service with the carrier. In a statement to The Verge, the company was quick to note that existing Next customers — and those who sign up before August 1st — won't be subject to the fees ""at this time."" AT&T's justification for these increases has traditionally been the ""administrative and other costs associated with activating or upgrading a device.""

First, Google Glass Enterprise Edition is said to be foldable like a normal pair of glasses, which should make carrying it around easier and less awkward. The right side, where the electronics are contained, can fold down thanks to a ""robust hinge"" that's been added to this model's design. (The left side does the same.) 9to5Google also claims that the new iteration of Glass will be water resistant and more durable. Google wants it to be able to withstand your normal everyday drops and bumps — and that's pretty important if it's going to be used in factories, warehouses, or other work environments where fragile treatment can't be guaranteed. Similarly, Google has apparently tweaked the appearance of Google Glass Enterprise Edition so it's a better match for its intended audience. It seems reality is starting to sink in, with Google no longer clinging to the false hope of Glass becoming a mainstay on runways and in fashion magazines. Other improvements reported by 9to5Google include a larger prism for a fuller viewing experience of the Glass interface, longer battery life than the Explorer Edition, and improved performance attributable to a new Intel Atom processor. But if you're a consumer, you won't have an easy time buying one. Google's current plans — always subject to change — apparently call for the Enterprise Edition to be made available exclusively to Glass for Work partners sometime this year.

The result of their two years' worth of work is a solar array with a diameter of just 8.9 feet (2.7 meters) when folded and a massive 82 feet (25 meters) when unfurled. A 1/20th scale model of the array is what you see here. To build the solar array, Shannon Zirbel and professor  Larry Howell of Brigham Young University, and mechanical engineer Brian Trease of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, enlisted the help of renowned origami expert Robert Lang. One of the major difficulties faced by the team is that solar arrays are not as thin as paper. ""You have to rethink a lot of that design in order to accommodate the thickness that starts to accumulate with each bend,"" Trease said in a press release.   Solar arrays already implement some basic accordion-style folding techniques to make it easier to get them up to space, but the novel circular design used here allows for more surface area in less space. It can also be wrapped around the satellite for launch, and it can be deployed without the assistance of an astronaut. It's not just for big satellites, either. Zirbel envisions smaller versions of the solar arrays could be used with inexpensive, mini satellites like CubeSats. The project is still in the prototype phase, but more work is being done to make these art-inspired solar arrays a reality.

The paper, published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, estimates that 100,000 elephants were killed by poachers between 2010 and 2012, driven largely by increased demand for ivory in China and other parts of Asia. Over the past decade, the percentage of African elephant deaths due to poaching has increased from about 25 percent to between 60 and 70 percent, suggesting that deaths are now outpacing births on the continent. ""We are shredding the fabric of elephant society and exterminating populations across the continent,"" George Wittemyer, a professor at Colorado State University and lead author of the study, told BBC News. demand for ivory has ravaged Africa's population Quantifying elephant population levels has always posed challenges, but Wittemyer and his team based their findings on data that was meticulously gathered at a reserve in Kenya over the past 16 years. They then combined those numbers with existing estimates from other regions, and extrapolated killing rates for the continent as a whole. The results, they say, are the most scientific estimates to date, and they paint a sobering picture. According to the study, more than 40,000 elephants were killed by poachers in 2011 — the worst year for elephant deaths — resulting in a 3 percent decline in species levels across Africa. The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) had previously estimated that just 25,000 elephants were killed in 2011. Much of the bloodshed has been driven by increased demand for ivory, which surged to over $2,000 per kilogram on the Chinese market earlier this year. Chinese officials have cracked down on the illicit trade in recent months, though conservationists have long called for stronger actions and international cooperation.",0.4290851686059894,0.5709148313940107,0.8966271984724562,325,5.3538461538461535,201,6.1194029850746272,0,0,"Science, US & World",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Researchers call the device a ""nanogenerator,"" and it looks like a flat metal plate with some wires attached. In reality, it's plastic sprayed with a sheet of tiny zinc oxide rods that generate electricity when squashed or stretched — as they would be in the presence of everyday background noise. The group is building off previous research that found solar cells became more efficient when exposed to acoustic vibrations, especially the high-pitched tones of pop music. This time around, there's no solar component, just what's known as piezoelectric energy generation. The research team, which worked in partnership with Nokia, says that these sheets can be produced cheaply and generate five volts of electricity, the same as most phone wall chargers.   In reality, you're not going to be throwing out your AC adapter just yet, and not just because this is a single, experimental prototype. The current is probably fairly low, just enough to maintain a charge. We also don't know how much different types or levels of background noise affect it.

The report describes the latest in a growing line of safety blunders, and this adds quite a few to the list. First, one government scientist rushed through a procedure and, in the process, contaminated a tame strain of bird flu with one that would be quite hazardous to humans. Afterward, when a second lab discovered the contamination, it failed to report it, despite protocol.  The CDC would really like its employees to follow protocol The initial contamination happened back in January, but the issue wasn't discovered until late May, after a sample had been shipped to another lab. It then wasn't until late June that the original lab noticed that something was off in the samples that it had sent out, finally prompting the second lab to disclose its finding. All contaminated samples were destroyed shortly thereafter, and animals that had been exposed to the samples for testing were euthanized and incinerated. While the CDC can't say precisely what happened within its lab that caused the contamination, it's fairly certain that it happened because scientists hadn't followed correct procedure. During a procedure that was supposed to take an hour and a half, a CDC researcher spent just 51 minutes in the lab — ""substantially less"" time than was necessary to properly follow protocol, the report says. The researcher had apparently been rushing in order to attend a noon meeting. This report follows several other government safety scares this year. In June, CDC employees were accidentally exposed to anthrax bacteria, and in July, the FDA discovered that it had left vials of smallpox lying around for about 60 years.",0.16684829849181446,0.8331517015081855,0.5801617885388318,313,5.0862619808306713,182,5.8626373626373622,0,0,Science,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The transaction left a lot of people scratching their heads: Oculus has been focused on high-end gaming applications, a market where Facebook has little to no experience. According to sources familiar with the deal, Oculus investors had offered the company more money to go it alone, but trying to compete with titans like Sony — which just showed its Project Morpheus headset last week — would've required an enormous additional investment that Facebook can provide out of the gate. Sources say that several big companies other than Facebook had also made overtures to Oculus about a potential acquisition, which could've accelerated Facebook's bid. Matrix Partners investor Antonio Rodriguez says the deal happened very quickly: ""Mark Zuckerberg has been aware of the company for perhaps the last few months, and he got very interested in the last seven days.""  Other bidders were in the mix For now, the company plans to stay in Los Angeles and continue to operate as before. ""Keep on doing what you're doing, back to changing the world, we're still on target,"" CEO Brendan Iribe wrote to employees in an internal memo, according to a source at the company. So, why Facebook? Oculus investor Chris Dixon, a partner at Andreessen Horowitz, says the best way to think of the deal is to compare it to a big acquisitions from a decade ago. ""The way to understand this purchase is to think of Google buying Android in 2005. That confused a lot of people at the time. Facebook believes that virtual reality will become the next major platform, the same way mobile computing did, and they want to make sure they have a big stake in that."" Facebook's founder seems to agree. ""There are not that many companies building technologies that could be the next computing platform, and Oculus is the clear leader,"" Mark Zuckerberg noted on a conference call about the acquisition Tuesday afternoon. He expanded on this logic in a Facebook post: ""Our mission is to make the world more open and connected. For the past few years, this has mostly meant building mobile apps that help you share with the people you care about. We have a lot more to do on mobile, but at this point we feel we're in a position where we can start focusing on what platforms will come next to enable even more useful, entertaining and personal experiences.""",0.5198374093603841,0.48016259063961586,0.8956882803675746,430,4.851162790697674,261,5.7241379310344831,1,0,"Business, Gaming, Web, Report",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

But it fell short of that valuation with a poor early response from the market, with shares opening at $20.50 — beneath the offer price of $22.50 — and falling still lower to close down 15 percent by the end of day.  It's still a big win for the company's founders and employees, but the company has a tall order ahead. The number of people who play Candy Crush, along with the sales and revenue it generates, has already begun to slow down and taper off. If it's going to succeed as a public company, it will need to find a new source of momentum. Zynga has made investors wary The promise and peril of King's business is a common phenomenon in the gaming industry. Zynga, which built its fortunes around Facebook gaming and its infamous title, Farmville, has struggled to find another big hit and lost more than half its value since going public. Zynga tried to replicate lightning in a bottle by buying up other breakout games, spending around $200 million for the viral sensation Draw Something. But that title's momentum atop the charts faded quickly, and sequels never measured up. King could easily have stayed private and milked this cash cow for many years to come. Its revenue in 2013 was $1.8 billion, of which a whopping $568 million was profit. So why go public at all? There are two simple reasons. King has raised $43 million from investors, and those backers typically demand the biggest return possible on their capital. Second, while yearly profits are nice, the founders stand to pocket a sum from this IPO that will launch them into the stratosphere of billionaires. It seems investors have absorbed these concerns and are being more cautious with the King IPO than they were with its predecessor, Zynga. In terms of revenue, profit, and customer base, King is far larger than Zynga was at the time it went public. But King is opening at roughly two times the value of Zynga, a clear sign that the market is wary of being burned a second time. And with King's stock fluctuating beneath its offering price at opening, it seems investors have taken note.",0.3006144868352843,0.6993855131647158,0.8568245631903465,415,4.6987951807228914,256,5.46875,0,0,Business,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

Their technology opens up the possibility of completely new kinds of experiences,"" Zuckerberg says. ""Immersive gaming will be the first, and Oculus already has big plans here that won't be changing and we hope to accelerate.""   Zuckerberg says that Facebook will ""focus on helping Oculus build out their product and develop partnerships to support more games."" But he makes clear that after Oculus sees through its gaming ambitions, Facebook will expand the product into new territory. ""We're going to make Oculus a platform for many other experiences. Imagine enjoying a court side seat at a game, studying in a classroom of students and teachers all over the world or consulting with a doctor face-to-face — just by putting on goggles in your home."" Zuckerberg equates Oculus to ""a new communication platform"" and clearly has a vision that extends far beyond the gaming focus that helped Oculus become a smash Kickstarter success. ""Imagine sharing not just moments with your friends online, but entire experiences and adventures."" The acquisition of Oculus seemingly comes out of nowhere: the company just demoed its most recent version of the Oculus Rift development kit at GDC 2014 to much fanfare. Oculus has been steadily moving towards a consumer product, and Facebook's resources can only help to push that mission along. ""Facebook understands the potential for VR,"" the Oculus team wrote in its own blog post announcing the deal. ""Mark and his team share our vision for virtual reality’s potential to transform the way we learn, share, play, and communicate. Facebook is a company that believes that anything is possible with the right group of people, and we couldn’t agree more."" But the most interesting question, as Zuckerberg lays out, is where the technology will go in the future. ""By feeling truly present, you can share unbounded spaces and experiences with the people in your life. Imagine sharing not just moments with your friends online, but entire experiences and adventures."" Zuckerberg says that future is coming sooner than anyone thinks, and he ""can't wait to start working with the whole team at Oculus to bring this future to the world, and to unlock new worlds for all of us."" Update: In a posting on Reddit, Oculus inventor Palmer Luckey said ""we won't let you down,"" adding that Facebook ""aligned"" with the company's own culture: In the end, I kept coming back to a question we always ask ourselves every day at Oculus: what's best for the future of virtual reality? Partnering with Mark and the Facebook team is a unique and powerful opportunity. The partnership accelerates our vision, allows us to execute on some of our most creative ideas and take risks that were otherwise impossible. Most importantly, it means a better Oculus Rift with fewer compromises even faster than we anticipated. Separately, Shuhei Yoshida, the president of Sony Worldwide Studios, said he did not see the announcement coming, despite the fact that it was within just a week of the company announcing its own VR headset program codenamed Project Morpheus.  Wow, I did not see this coming, congratulations! @oculus @brendaniribe @natemitchell  Update 2: John Carmack of Id Software fame, who joined on to become Oculus' CTO this past August, says the Facebook deal will keep virtual reality from suffering scaling issues: For the record, I am coding right now, just like I was last week.I expect the FB deal will avoid several embarrassing scaling crisis for VR.

But 9,522 people saw the device’s potential, donating $2.4 million through Kickstarter to get early versions built and shipped to game developers. They wanted to see Oculus build ""the future of virtual reality."" They didn’t expect it to get bought by Facebook. ""I cannot put into words how betrayed I feel by this,"" backer Sergey Chubukov writes on the Oculus Kickstarter comment page. ""I feel cheated. I backed a vision of what I wanted gaming to be in the future. Now all I want is my money back,"" writes Grant Wilkinson. ""I'm disappointed. You had the potential to become bigger than Facebook on your own,"" says John Susek. ""I cannot put into words how betrayed I feel by this."" Unlike many Kickstarter projects, Oculus actually delivered on its promise to ship early versions of the hardware to people who donated. But its grand rhetoric gave backers the impression that they were buying into the virtual reality revolution and would be along for the full ride. Not all the reactions were negative; some are optimistic that Facebook will give Oculus the resources it needs to make virtual reality robust and widespread. But most seem to feel that it would have been better to see Oculus grow up on its own — and if it couldn’t, it would have been better to see it bought by a company with a proven track record on gaming, hardware, privacy, or taking care of its acquisitions. ""What made Oculus so great was that it was a DIY project by a kid in his garage that was so good that it gave John Carmack pause,"" says Jordan Orelli, a developer who lives in New York, referring to the creator of Doom who first enthused about the Rift and even quit his day job to focus on it full-time. ""What has Facebook done for gaming? Nothing,"" Orelli says. ""If it was Valve that had bought Oculus, I would have peed my pants uncontrollably. Apple, Google, Sony, Nintendo, fuck, even Microsoft would have all been better than Facebook.""  It also doesn’t help that Facebook has turned into a service people generally distrust but also feel like they can’t quit. By doing what many backers see as a bait-and-switch in order to align itself with a company many people see as untrustworthy, Oculus may have done serious damage to its reputation. Minecraft founder Markus Persson, an early Oculus backer, was especially shaken. ""I did not chip in ten grand to seed a first investment round to build value for a Facebook acquisition,"" he wrote in a blog post last night. ""I will not work with Facebook. Their motives are too unclear and shifting, and they haven't historically been a stable platform."" Oculus and Facebook announced the acquisition with a press release and a call with journalists. Oculus emailed its press release to backers and posted a contrite blog post seemingly as an afterthought. But after the blowback, founder Palmer Luckey jumped on Reddit to do damage control. ""I won't change, and any change at Oculus will be for the better."" Oculus will operate independently of Facebook, he promised, and users will never have to sign in using Facebook to play Oculus games. ""I am sorry that you are disappointed. To be honest, if I were you, I would probably have a similar initial impression!"" he writes. ""I won't change, and any change at Oculus will be for the better,"" he continues. ""We have even more freedom than we had under our investment partners because Facebook is making a long-term play on the success of VR, not short-term returns. A lot of people are upset, and I get that. If you feel the same way a year from now, I would be very surprised."" Oculus can now afford to make custom hardware instead of relying on the scraps from the mobile phone industry, hire anyone it wants, and make large investments in content, he says, adding ""this is about the best possible outcome for the future of virtual reality, not my wallet."" And in another comment, again: ""We promise we won't change."" It’s out of backers’ hands In the end, it’s a story that’s been told many times. A small, beloved startup gets bought by a larger company with stronger profit motives; fans bemoan the founders for being sellouts and fret that the product will lose its heart. This time, fans were financially invested as well as emotionally invested. Being mostly independent game developers, they were also building the first layer of Oculus’s business. But the story is not much different, and the ending will be the same. Facebook will change Oculus, for better or for worse. It’s out of backers’ hands.

The chipmaker confirmed today that it has acquired Basis Science, the company behind the Basis fitness band. The band was first released in 2013, and an updated version came out last month. Like competition from Fitbit and Jawbone, the band collects walking data and sleep information, though it one-ups those other products with an optical sensor to record heart rate, perspiration, and body temperature. TechCrunch first reported the deal earlier this month for a rumored price of roughly $100 million. The final figure has not been announced. The acquisition may not seem like a natural fit for Intel, which is known primarily as a producer of chips. However, last year the company formed a ""New Devices"" group under former Apple and Palm executive Mike Bell that was tasked with staying on top of trends and emerging product categories. Basis team will work on ""future wearable initiatives"" at Intel At this year's CES, Intel showed off a number of reference devices from the group, including a smart watch and a wearable headset with Siri-like functionality. Intel doesn't plan to produce this hardware for sale, but the reference devices can help spur on chip purchases as other manufacturers move forward with making similar devices of their own. In an interview with Recode from earlier this year, Bell said that ""we’re showing what’s possible ... we will work with other companies to bring them to market."" With the acquisition, Basis' staff with be folded into the New Devices group. In a press release, Bell says that the acquisition ""provides immediate entry into the market with a leader in health tracking for wearable devices."" He added, ""we will build upon this foundation to deliver products that bring people greater utility and value."" The Basis team, meanwhile, says in the blog post that ""we felt like the momentum Basis had generated on its own would only be greater with the technical, manufacturing, global reach and support resources Intel has to offer."" Intel says that the team will be left to continue work on its future products and continue support for its current fitness bands while it is brought into the company to ""begin work on future wearable initiatives.""",0.6077288728343853,0.39227112716561474,0.8474905661892848,395,5.0227848101265824,239,5.9037656903765692,0,0,"Business, Tech",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

He said that the team had agreed, for the time being, to stay independent — to make sure that it didn't have to cater to another company's business strategy in order to further its goals. When Oculus raised $100 million in funding, it seemed that independence was assured, even though the company picked up a few new bosses along the way. But today, Facebook bought Oculus for $2 billion, including $400 million in cash. If Oculus already had enough money to launch its consumer virtual reality platform, why would it sell to Mark Zuckerberg? We just asked Oculus CEO Brendan Iribe and founder Palmer Luckey that very question. Luckey says that Facebook will not only allow Oculus to stay independent, but that it will also provide the resources to design and produce components purpose-built for virtual reality hardware. Though originally, Oculus piggybacked on the low cost of commodity components built for smartphones, Luckey says that won't necessarily fly from here on out. ""Great virtual reality has different requirements than great cellphones,"" says the founder. ""This is going to let us do things that would have just been far and away impossible without Facebook."" You can read our full conversation with Luckey and Iribe below. Why did you decide to do this? Did Sony's announcement spur a deal? Oculus CEO Brendan Iribe: We've been working on this relationship for a while. It really started with us just getting to know Mark and his team: they were interested to see a demo, they came down, we showed them a demo, we started talking about the vision, and they got excited. ""They believe in our vision of virtual reality."" Basically, Mark said, ""Is there any way we can help, is there anything we can do? Any kind of partnership, anything we could invest in or promote? How can we be a part of this and help make virtual reality even bigger and even better?"" After meeting and talking and hanging out a lot, we started to get to know each other, we started to trust each other, we started to tell Mark and his team more about the future and how we saw this impacting the world, and how big an impact it could be, and how we were really focused on hiring the very best people in the world... and ultimately how we wanted to get out the hardware to as many people as we could, as fast as we could, at the most affordable price. As we went down that path, Mark said, ""I think we really could help you on that side of it. You clearly know what you're doing on gaming, we don't need to have any real impact on that, but I think we could help you on some other parts."" And that's where the discussion went. Oculus is all about the gaming community right now, we're super focused on that. But with this acquisition and with this partnership, we can now get the virtual reality platform out to more people faster, better, and at a lower cost. You had $100 million in funding, and a year ago Palmer told me that the company wanted to be independent. What did you need from Facebook that would be worth changing that? What are you getting from Facebook that could make this happen any differently than you could with $100 million in funding? Oculus founder Palmer Luckey: They believe in our vision of virtual reality. There are so many other companies that have been interested, they have a vision of what they wanted to do to fit into our product roadmap, and if they bought us it would be so that we could build what they wanted us to build. Mark does believe in our vision of virtual reality, and we're going to continue operating independently, delivering what we've always wanted to deliver. This gives us a lot of resources to do what we've always wanted to do, but it doesn't change what we want to do. What tangible benefit was there to signing on with Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook right now — something that you couldn't do with $100 million in funding? Iribe: When you look at this and where it's all going, the hardware business requires a lot of investment. It's very hard, it's very expensive, and ramping up hard on any given platform, whether it's a console or any kind of PC or mobile device, going into the hardware business requires a lot of investment. We had a lot of investment, and that was great, but at this point, we're looking at scaling this, at going out and acquiring components, and doing deals with some of the biggest companies in the world that got behind us and were working with us so that — because they believed in it and they wanted to, and in many ways they were trying to give us the benefit of the doubt, and almost bend the rules on how much of a commitment they normally require from companies. Now we're able to show up and say ""Hey guys, not only are we in this for a very long time, and the risk is a lot lower that we're going to go away or have any financial problems, but we're now ready to step up and actually put in bigger orders and bigger commitments, and hit bigger volumes around where virtual reality can go."" I think that's a key part of it. ""Great virtual reality has different technical requirements than great cellphones."" Luckey: Another thing to keep in mind is that up until now, we've largely been driven by the mobile phone market, most of the hardware we've been using is out of the mobile phone market. But as virtual reality gets more and more advanced, the right thing to do is develop hardware that's made specifically for virtual reality. Great virtual reality has different technical requirements than great cellphones, and like Brendan said, the hardware business is really, really expensive. Designing new display technologies is really, really expensive. This is going to let us do things that would have just been far and away impossible without Facebook.  We want to deliver the best possible product, at the lowest possible cost, and this was clearly a panacea to do that. So does this change your roadmap? Does this mean the headset will come any quicker, or any cheaper, or be any better in any particular way than it would have been previously? Luckey: This does let the headset be better and cheaper. Our roadmap is about the same as it's always been, but there are a lot of things we'd wanted to do that now we can really execute on. This does make the Rift cheaper and better, both in the near term and the long term. Another thing is that we're going to be able to devote a lot of resources to content that we would not have been able to do otherwise. Virtual reality is a tough sell for a software developer. They have to convince investors that not only are they going to  build a good game, which is what they normally have to do, they have to convince them that it's going to be a good game and that virtual reality will be successful. This puts us in a position where we can invest in games because we know virtual reality is going to be successful; we just have to believe in the game. You're going to see a lot more coming out of our content investment and publishing side. Is there now a long-term plan to develop a virtual reality platform with Facebook itself? ""We're a rocket, and we just attached ourselves to an even bigger rocket."" Iribe: We can't comment on any announcements right now besides this partnership, but I think that you'll see the announcements we make in the future, literally they're going to be bigger, better, and faster, and we're incredibly excited to go into this new world of virtual reality with one of the biggest, fastest growing companies of all time. That's why we did this deal. We're a rocket, and we just attached ourselves to an even bigger rocket to get it out there and deliver a better virtual reality experience to the world.

With no apparent financial motive, attackers seized comprehensive employee information and brought the company's systems to a standstill. All told, the attack wiped out three quarters of the company's Vegas-based servers, which insiders estimate cost the company more than $40 million in equipment costs and data recovery alone. ""Encouraging the use of WMD...is a crime"" The attack seems to have been provoked by a speech Sands CEO Sheldon Adelson made the previous October. Adelson, a staunch defender of Israel, had advocated for stronger threats of nuclear attacks against Iran, going so far as to suggest detonating a nuclear bomb in the Nevada desert as a warning of what would happen if Tehran continued its nuclear program. In response, the attackers left a message on company servers: ""Encouraging the use of Weapons of Mass Destruction, UNDER ANY CONDITION, is a Crime."" The note was signed from the ""Anti WMD Team."" They also took down company websites, replacing them with a photograph of Adelson and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The attack is strongly believed to have been sponsored by Iran and, together with recent attacks against Sony, sets a dangerous precedent for state attacks against privately held companies. In both cases, the US intelligence services' billion-dollar Cyber Command facilities were not much use in defending against the attacks or mitigating the damage once it had been done.

In a statement, the two cities' district attorneys say that Uber misled passengers about the effectiveness of its background checks, misrepresented fees for safety checks and airport tolls, operated in airports without permission, and did not get state approval for the system it used to calculate pricing. ""Uber has refused to comply with straightforward California laws that protect consumers from fraud and harm,"" said district attorneys George Gascón and Jackie Lacey. ""These companies can be innovative in the way they deliver services without ignoring the laws that protect the public."" The news comes days after Portland, Oregon filed suit against Uber for launching service without the city's permission, threatening thousands of dollars in fines to drivers. And abroad, Spain, Thailand, and India have all ordered it to cease operations. Uber led customers to believe its background checks were the best in the business Uber, which launched in San Francisco in 2010, has been fighting local governments from the start. It circumvents traditional taxi organizations, and critics have questioned whether it sufficiently vets its operators, a concern that's been exacerbated by periodic sexual assault accusations against drivers, an accidental death, and one violent attack on a passenger. In their complaint, Gascón and Lacey say that Uber's marketing materials and a $1 ""Safe Rides Fee"" led customers to believe that it ran exceptionally rigorous background checks on drivers before letting them on the road. But they say that Uber does not include a fingerprint check that would stop drivers from passing off someone else's identification as their own, and that it put out misleading information after allowing convicted criminals to become Uber drivers. Gascón and Lacey initially sent letters to Uber, Lyft, and Sidecar earlier this year, threatening legal action. In this complaint, they are requesting that Uber comply with California law and provide restitution to customers, paying a $2,500 fee per legal violation and refunding any Safe Rides or Airport Toll fees that they collected. Uber wasn't the only ride-sharing app to come under fire today. A complaint was also filed against Lyft, which the cities also accused of misrepresenting background checks and operating without approval. But Lyft, it turns out, has already settled. A separate press release said that the company had agreed to cease any misleading statements, submit its app for government approval, and get permission before operating in airports. Additionally, it will pay civil penalties of $500,000, half of which will be waived after a year if Lyft has met all the other terms of the settlement. In a statement, Uber spokesperson Eva Behrend defended the company. ""Californians and California lawmakers all agree — Uber is an integral, safe, and established part of the transportation ecosystem in the Golden State,"" she wrote. ""Uber has met with the district attorneys to address their concerns regarding airport operations, the uberPOOL product, background checks, and operation of the app. We will continue to engage in discussions with the district attorneys.""

Today, though, 60 tech companies, including Intel, IBM, and Qualcomm, have signed a letter opposing reclassifying broadband service under Title II of the Telecommunications Act — a solution that's favored by many of net neutrality's supporters and President Barack Obama himself. The letter is addressed to members of Congress and the FCC, and it warns that this stricter regulation would stop companies from investing in broadband. ""For almost twenty years, national leadership, on a bipartisan basis, has nurtured the broadband internet with a wise, effective, and restrained policy approach that supported the free flow of data, services, and ideas online while creating a climate that supported private investment in broadband networks,"" reads the letter. But ""Title II is going to lead to a slowdown, if not a hold, in broadband build out, because if you don't know that you can recover on your investment, you won't make it."" ""If you don't know that you can recover on your investment, you won't make it."" This is a familiar argument from broadband providers, who argue that Title II's regulations will be so strict and numerous that they'll make it difficult to operate a network. It's not purely talk: last month, AT&T said it was putting its super-fast fiber network development on hold during net neutrality negotiations. In that case, though, the problem wasn't just Title II, it was that AT&T didn't yet know what rules would be passed. Either way, this didn't stop it from launching a fiber network weeks later in North Carolina. FCC chair Tom Wheeler has said that while there are definitely parts of Title II that shouldn't apply to the internet, they can be stripped out of net neutrality rules. This list's signatories are members of the Telecommunications Industry Association, which hosts the letter, and they're largely companies involved in network management, like router manufacturers Cisco and D-Link. This, they say, gives them a personal stake in the debate. They believe reduced investment would ""flow downstream, landing first and squarely on technology companies like ours, and then working its way through the economy overall,"" including their customers. Cisco's CEO has previously expressed opposition to Title II. This letter puts Intel, Qualcomm, and the rest in opposition to younger companies like Netflix and Kickstarter, which have participated in public protests in favor of Title II. The Internet Association, a major lobbying group that represents Netflix, Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Twitter among others, has also voiced support for Obama's reclassification proposal. They'll all be waiting until next year for a decision, however: the FCC originally said it hoped to have rules in place by the end of the year, but it's since delayed them until 2015.",0.39072158948028035,0.6092784105197196,0.8524426109759001,475,5.2315789473684209,289,6.1384083044982702,0,0,"Policy & Law, US & World",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

Documents obtained by the AP show that contractors hired by the US Agency for International Development (USAID) tried to promote certain Cuban hip-hop artists within the country in the hopes of bolstering a youth movement against the communist government of Raúl Castro. But the program backfired, putting targets at greater risk, forcing some musicians to flee the country, and threatening Cuba's thriving underground rap community. At the center of the program is a Washington, DC-based company called Creative Associates International, which was paid millions to help subvert the Cuban government. Part of the contract work involved creating a fake Twitter-like social network in Cuba, which the AP reported on earlier this year. USAID later refuted the AP's report on the service, saying it contained ""significant inaccuracies and false conclusions."" On Wednesday, the agency repeated its claims that it does not engage in covert operations. US sought to turn hip-hop groups into ""agents of social mobilization.""   ""Any assertions that our work is secret or covert are simply false,"" USAID said in a statement to the AP yesterday, adding that its mandate is to strengthen society ""often in places where civic engagement is suppressed and where people are harassed, arrested, subjected to physical harm or worse."" The program was initially helmed by a Serbian contractor named Rajko Bozic, who, beginning in 2009, focused on a widely respected hip-hop group called Los Aldeanos. Creative spent thousands of dollars to promote the group with its own TV program and distributed it on DVD to avoid government censorship, funneling its funds through a company in Panama and a bank in Liechtenstein. Contractors also urged other artists to perform alongside Los Aldeanos, and later put the group through covert training ""to focus them a little more on their role as agents of social mobilization,"" documents show. Contractors apparently sought to infiltrate pro-government organizations as well. At one point, they approached a sex education organization run by the daughter of President Raúl Castro and urged them to participate in a festival Bozic organized in Serbia. In another instance, USAID contractors funded an arts and music festival organized by a singer with close ties to the government, with the aim of influencing ""the minds of festival organizers with new ideas"" and urging them to send ""high-impact messages"" to their audience. But by this point, Cuban authorities were on to the operation, and it soon fell apart. Officials detained Bozic and seized his equipment, and later interrogated Adrian Monzon — the only Cuban who knowingly worked for Creative — over Bozic's links to the CIA. In 2010, Los Aldeanos performed at Rotilla, a major independent music festival in Cuba, and lashed out onstage against government officials and police. Cuban authorities then took over the festival, and Los Aldeanos soon relocated for Florida, saying they could no longer work in Cuba because of government pressure.",0.4243318806100994,0.5756681193899006,0.8578295267949189,529,5.3686200378071831,313,6.5271565495207664,0,0,"Policy & Law, US & World",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

A motion filed by the Associated Press, Bloomberg, and CNN yesterday asked for the tape, a section of which was played during trial last week, to be released. Some 27 minutes of that footage were shown in court last week. Despite the potentially beneficial statements made by Jobs in Apple's defense, the company's lawyers fought the effort to make it public, saying it was not admitted into evidence as an exhibit, and thus does not fall under a court order that requires each exhibit to be shared with the press. ""Steve Jobs is not your typical trial witness."" ""We're not asking for anything other than what the jury heard,"" argued Tom Burke, a partner at law firm David Wright Tremaine who's representing the media companies. ""Steve Jobs is not your typical trial witness, and that's what makes this a unique circumstance."" Apple's lawyer Jonathan Sherman, a partner at law firm Boies, Schiller, and Flexner accused Burke and the media companies of being opportunistic during a hearing in Oakland's federal court building this evening. ""The marginal value of seeing him again, in his black turtleneck — this time very sick — is small,"" Sherman said, contrasting that with high-profile appearances like Apple product releases, and when Jobs stumped for a new campus at a city council meeting in Cupertino. ""What they they want is a dead man, and they want to show him to the rest of the world, because it's a judicial record."" Burke replied by saying it was not a frivolous request, and calling the testimony ""invaluable."" US district court judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers voiced strong concerns about somehow making the video public, saying it would break the court's basic rule that keeps any of the proceedings from being recorded on video. ""The request you're asking for frankly is diametrically opposed from the rule that says I cannot allow the recording of these proceedings,"" Judge Rogers told Burke. ""So if I'm treating witnesses the same, I haven't recorded any of the experts, I haven't recorded anything — and none of that's going to go to the jury."" Judge Rogers ultimately said she still needed more time to go over the arguments, and would accept an additional argument from Burke and the companies as long as it's filed by the end of the week.  This hasn't been the only hiccup This hasn't been the only hiccup during the trial, which started last week. With 8 million iPod buyers that are a part of a class action lawsuit against Apple, it's turned out to be awfully hard to find one who actually bought the right product at the right time. For the past week, attorneys in the case — which accuse Apple of locking out competing music services from iTunes and iPods made in the mid-2000s — have been scrambling to come up with someone to represent that group after others have been removed for being found ineligible. While there are millions who bought the devices during the affected time period, the law requires someone to represent that class as a lead plaintiff, which means they purchased the correct device at the right time and have no conflicts of interest. Two plaintiffs have already been dropped from the complaint, including one yesterday who the court decided did not purchase the correct devices at the correct time, and whose purchases were made using her ex-husband's law firm's credit card. They're still trying to get a replacement plaintiff Faced with the prospect of having no plaintiffs, attorneys for the class filed to get a new group of potential replacements. One made it through questioning earlier today, and could ultimately represent the 8 million people in the class. That person purchased two iPods, only one of which appears eligible during the timeframe outlined in the suit. ""We've got someone here who made a purchase with her own funds, has some experience, is intelligent and concerned, and doesn't have any relationship to the lawyers, and reached out on her own accord,"" Judge Rogers told the plaintiffs' lawyers. ""In light of that, I'm happy to have you investigate further,"" she told Apple. With a possible $350 million in damages, the stakes for Apple in the case are relatively low in light of the billions it rakes in every quarter. That number could be tripled, though, if the jury says Apple violated antitrust laws, which would push it beyond what Apple initially won in its patent trial against Samsung two years ago. The stakes for Apple are low The trial kicked off in earnest last week with testimonies from two of its executives, Eddy Cue and Phil Schiller, as well as the recorded Jobs deposition. Jeff Robbin, who headed Apple's iTunes team after Apple bought his company SoundJam and turned it into its own music software, also testified. All said that any changes the company made to iTunes were done to fulfill contracts with record labels as well as for security purposes, likening any competing efforts by other companies (such as RealNetworks' Harmony software) to malicious hacking. The case is expected to close as soon as Monday of next week, with jury deliberations to follow. Apple still has yet to make its defense, though it has pushed its side of the story when its employees were up on the stand. The trial was originally expected to wrap up this Friday, a deadline that was derailed after the disqualification of plaintiffs.",0.43509715365092394,0.5649028463490761,0.8330584370384347,944,4.8813559322033901,479,6.1544885177453024,0,0,"Apple, Policy & Law, Tech, US & World",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

But those details apparently didn't mean the agency was any closer to completing those rules, as FAA official Peggy Gilligan told a congressional House panel today. ""We all agree that the project is taking too long,"" she said. The panel — run by the House's Transportation and Infrastructure Committee — was convened to address provisions of the FAA Reauthorization and Reform Act of 2012 specific to Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS), or drones. Those provisions set forth a timeline for the FAA to integrate drone usage into the National Airspace System, and the agency has been falling behind. The panel featured testimony from Gilligan, the Department of Transportation's Assistant Inspector General for Aviation Audits Matthew Hampton, and Gerald Dillingham, the director of civil aviation for the Government Accountability Office, among others. Most notably, Dillingham testified that ""the consensus of opinion is the integration of unmanned systems will likely slip from the mandated deadline until 2017 or even later."" ""The consensus of opinion is the integration of unmanned systems will likely slip from the mandated deadline until 2017 or even later.""  Gilligan went on to add that the FAA has ""a balanced proposal that is currently under executive review."" The problem is that these proposals generate public comments, which the agency needs to consider before it can issue final rules. Hampton spoke to those concerns in his testimony, saying that the agency is behind schedule on half of the act's remaining requirements. The FAA will not be able to safely integrate UAS technology by September 2015 ""Ultimately,"" Hampton said, ""the FAA will not meet the act’s overarching goal to safely integrate UAS technology by September 2015."" Hampton also testified that the reason the agency has fallen behind schedule is actually three-fold. ""The agency also faces significant technological, regulatory, and management challenges,"" he said. The technological problems he mentioned involve lost-link scenarios (when an operator loses connectivity with the aircraft) and establishing secure radio frequency spectrum for flight. These are things that the FAA, DoD, and NASA are working to solve, but according to Hampton ""it remains unclear when the technology will be robust enough to support UAS operations."" On the regulatory side, Hampton said that while the FAA has authorized limited UAS operations on a case-by-case basis, it's still not in a position to certify civil operations wholesale. ""The FAA has worked with a special advisory committee for more than nine years, but it has not yet reached consensus with stakeholders on minimum performance and design standards for UAS technology,"" Hampton testified. The management challenges he spoke about sounded equally dire: Dillingham furthered this point in his testimony. Even though the FAA has used the establishment of UAS test sites as one of the signs that some progress is being made, Dillingham testified that there are major systemic problems at hand. According to him, ""the test site operators told us that they were significantly under-utilized by the FAA and the private sector, and that they were unclear as to what research and development and operational data was needed by the FAA to support the integration initiatives."" On top of that, there is legislation that restricts what data the FAA can task the test sites for — another thing that has hampered progress. It's been speculated that the agency would miss the September 2015 deadline for a while now, and the slow pace has caused pushback from companies looking to expand into commercial drone usage. The other day, Amazon threatened to move its drone research abroad if the FAA delayed any further. Committee member Frank LoBiondo, the Republican Congressman for New Jersey's second district, directly addressed that issue during the committee hearing: Even though it looks like the FAA is going to continue to miss deadlines, the agency is still working to get rules in place for commercial drone usage by opening its proposal to public comment (if and when it gets approved). In the meantime, the agency will still have to approve commercial usage on a slow, case-by-case basis — something it continued to do this afternoon when it announced four new companies that are allowed to fly commercially.",0.4528389283059543,0.5471610716940457,0.8475222660209738,721,5.3120665742024968,394,6.4289340101522843,0,0,"Policy & Law, US & World",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

There's no shortage of ways to play classic Blue Bomber games, but this collection is something different; it's the first release from Digital Eclipse, a new studio focused on preserving classic games for future generations. ""Movies have the Criterion Collection, but there hasn't been anything like that for games,"" Frank Cifaldi, head of restoration at Digital Eclipse, says in a statement. ""We're living in the golden age of a brand new form of artistic expression, and we're not doing a very good job of making sure our games will be available five years from now, let alone 50. The more we can do right now to take video game preservation seriously, the safer our history will be.""   ""We're not doing a very good job of making sure our games will be available five years from now."" In addition to the games, the Mega Man Legacy Collection will also include a host of bonus material, including concept sketches and other art. The digital museum will gather together Mega Man-related material from 1987 to 1992. According to Digital Eclipse, while the collection has lots to dig into for diehard fans of the series, the aim is also to ""introduce newcomers to what made Mega Man such a popular and iconic character."" While Mega Man is one of the most iconic names in gaming, the series has largely died off of late. Longtime producer Keiji Inafune recently left Capcom and is now working on his own, Mega Man-inspired game called Mighty No. 9. While the new Mega Man collection will be the first release from Digital Eclipse, the plan is to do the same with more games moving forward. The company built its own engine with the goal of making it easier to make old games playable on new hardware. Unlike books or movies, the process of archiving and preserving video games is particularly difficult, due largely to the hardware requirements; the new Eclipse Engine aims to streamline that process. ""Once a game is converted to our Eclipse format, it will run anywhere Eclipse does,"" the company says of its engine. ""And we'll keep it updated, too, meaning that wherever we go, the games can easily follow."" The collection will be available for $14.99 on console and PC this summer, with the 3DS version launching later in the year.

Filling the gap between laptops and phones meant making a choice between a desktop or a mobile operating system. HP and Microsoft opted for the supposedly more capable desktop choice, Apple went for upscaling its iPhone OS. The iPad won that battle. Then there was the question of size, with some prototype tablets stretching all the way to 15 inches (acting as essentially keyboard-less laptops), but Apple set the standard at just under 10 inches. And finally, most under-appreciated of all, perhaps, is the issue of the aspect ratio: Apple chose the squarer 4:3 format while almost everyone else went for the widescreen 16:9 or 16:10, which would better match the dimensions of a movie. Well, now we can conclusively say that the iPad’s won that battle as well. Samsung’s move to 4:3 this year is simply a reaction to what experience has taught us: humans prefer squarer tablets, whether they’re Apple-branded or not. Microsoft’s Surface 3 and Surface Pro 3 — both using a 3:2 aspect ratio that sits somewhere between the widescreen 16:9 and the iPad’s shape — both earned commendations in our reviews for their improved ergonomics. The Nexus 9 has its flaws, but it’s still one of our favorite Android tablets, and a big reason for that is the comfort of using its 4:3 screen. Even the absurdly large HP Slate Pro 12 has adopted this aspect ratio, and it’s no coincidence that it’s surprisingly easy to handle for its size. The inherent problem of widescreen tablets is that they’re too narrowly (pun intended) focused on movie playback. Sure, watching a film without any black bars on the screen makes for a neater viewing experience, but what happens when you want to look up some details about that movie’s cast or production online? You get an uncomfortable web browser that is either too wide (in landscape mode) or too narrow (in portrait). The same is true of reading ebooks and comics or browsing through your photos: all are a better match to the iPad’s 4:3 than the widescreen options that have been on offer from Android tablets up until now. Copying Apple’s choice of screen size just makes sense. The original iPad’s prediction of what tablets of the future, which is now our present, would look like is impressively accurate even by Apple’s high standards. As much of a benchmark device as the iPhone may be, it’s often shown Apple in the role of a late follower: it grew beyond a 4-inch screen later than its Android competitors, and it embraced the 16:9 aspect ratio that is now a universal standard later than most others. The iPad, by contrast, basically set its core premise of mobile apps and software combined with a photo-friendly screen size; everything that’s come since then has been just refinement of that original formula. Every time a truly intriguing iPad competitor has emerged, it’s featured the 4:3 aspect ratio. HP’s ill-fated TouchPads failed because of immature software, not because of their shape or size, which were widely appreciated. There’s the aforementioned Nexus 9, plus the incoming Nokia N1 and Jolla Tablet, and who can forget the shameless iPad mini clone that was the Mi Pad? Now that Samsung has given up trying to be different from the iPad — not that it was ever such a massive effort — it may seem like we’re doomed to inhabit a homogenous tablet world of just iPads and iPad derivatives. That’s the exact nightmare scenario envisioned by Motorola’s Xoom advert that aired during the Super Bowl in 2011, but if Moto wanted to prevent it from happening, it should have offered something better than the iPad. It didn’t, and no one else has either. The iPad keeps winning, at least in part, because everyone around it keeps getting lost in the chase for diversification. Maybe it’s better to let that go and focus on simply being better, and on beating the iPad on its own terms. Samsung’s new Galaxy Tabs may not be original, but they now have most of what makes Apple’s tablet appealing, including its dimensions and extras like fingerprint security. Apple and Samsung are now aligned on the same development path, but that need not preclude innovation from others. Amazon’s Kindle Fire tablets haven’t yet fallen in the 4:3 line, and it's possible that they never will, while Microsoft’s Surface devices continue evolving an intriguing hybrid category where the keyboard and stylus are still held up as important inputs to a fully featured tablet experience. Holdouts of this kind will keep consumer choice in tablets varied for the foreseeable future, though it will surely be narrower — mostly because consumers have already made the choice, again and again, for the squarer, friendlier shape of the iPad.

No, not via litigation in Apple’s endless proxy war with Google, but through good ol’ fashioned competition.  In the US alone, courts have awarded Apple about $700 million in damages. A 2012 decision said that Apple was due $930 million, later reduced to $548 million on appeal in May 2015. A second trial in 2014 agreed that Apple was owed another $120 million. Those numbers don’t account for lawyer fees which Apple pegged at more than $60 million back in 2013 for its US lawyers, in an intellectual property battle that has raged across the globe since 2011. But for the sake of simplicity, let’s assume that Samsung has been punished to the tune of $700 million. With that in mind, take a look at this chart: See that big dip in Q3 2014 operating profit at Samsung’s mobile division? That’s the quarter when Apple stopped talking about the length of your thumb and launched its first big phones: the 4.7-inch iPhone 6 and 5.5-inch 6 Plus — devices that had been heavily rumored prior to their September 9th announcement. In the two quarters that followed, Samsung’s mobile group has seen 7.2 trillion won wiped off its profits from the same period a year prior. That’s about $6.2 billion in six months, or about nine times more than the $700 million Samsung was penalized through Apple litigation over the last four years. The benefit to Apple is even greater if you look at Cupertino’s record profits over those same two quarters. Of course, there are other forces at work here besides Apple. Samsung’s mobile operating profit numbers include sales of tablets and feature phones, in addition to high-end smartphones. Chinese and Indian brands have been putting the squeeze on Samsung at the low- and mid-range of its mobile lineup for several quarters now as Apple pummels it from the top with phablet devices popularized by Samsung. But profits tend to come from fat margins on premium smartphones and, so far, the launch of the metal and glass Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge has yet to turn the tide: Samsung Electronics recently warned of a 4 percent drop in operating profits for Q2 2015 compared to Q2 2014. Litigation has proven to be a fool's errand for Apple and only helped raise the profile of Samsung in the process. Where before Samsung had been just yet another maker of plastic Android rectangles, Apple told the world that Samsung was its equivalent. A copy. And there’s no such thing as bad publicity. With hindsight it’s clear that the best way to compete is by building the most competitive product. NASA's refrigerator-sized Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) launched in February this year, perched atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, on a mission to warn Earth of incoming solar storms. Now five months later, the satellite has sent back its first image of the planet it was designed to protect — a beautiful color image of Earth. The patent infringement battle between Apple and Samsung has been raging since 2011, and apparently it's still going. Some of Silicon Valley's top companies — Google, Facebook, HP among others — filed a ""friend of the court"" briefing on July 1st, protesting the decision against Samsung. (The briefing can be found on PACER under case number 14-1335, for those of you who like to peruse legal documents.) Hillary hosted her first Facebook Q&A, answering questions on her ""vision for a better economy."" She also took the time to respond to some more informal queries, letting users know that being a grandmother was ""THE BEST THING EVER"" and that she ""never met a pantsuit [she] didn't love,"" before dropping in a link to some official Clinton schwag: the Everyday Pantsuit Tee. She even signed out with a GIF (above). Modern culture is almost overwhelmingly digital, whether you're talking about the production or distribution of music, drama, and art. That's led to a tendency away from the traditional forms like the theater, opera, and classical music performances, but now the old guard is taking a few lessons from the digital age as well. The Hallé Orchestra in Manchester, England, is organizing a 10-piece performance on September 6th where patrons will be allowed to set their own ticket price after enjoying the performance. Benicio Del Toro has been offered the part of the villain in Star Wars Episode VIII, according to The Wrap and Variety. The untitled movie is set for release on May 26th, 2017, and will be helmed by Looper and Brick director Rian Johnson. Variety says that the studio is looking for big-name talent in this villain role, with Joaquin Phoenix also having met about the part. Both publications, however, note that a deal is far from being locked in.

Now, a company called Z is using Kickstarter to deliver a new camera for filmmakers who want cheap 4K capability in a compact form factor. The camera is called the E1, and it's the world's smallest 4K camera that uses interchangeable lenses. The E1 is about twice as big and heavy as a GoPro, and there is a lot packed into its magnesium housing. It's equipped with Wi-Fi, Bluetooth Low Energy, and uses a Panasonic image sensor and an Ambarella A9 image processor to capture cinema 4K footage (4096 x 2160) at 24 frames per second or UHD video (3840 x 2160) at 30 frames per second. The E1 can also shoot 1080p video at 60 frames per second (the company says 120 frames per second capability is in the works), and it shoots 16 megapixel RAW (DNG) and JPG images. 4K video and 16 megapixel images The camera's sensitivity maxes out at an ISO of 102,400, and the company claims users can expect good image quality up to 6400 ISO thanks to proprietary noise filtering.  (Jason Zhang, founder of Z, showed me a video he shot in a night club that was particularly impressive.) The big draw here, however, is that the E1 uses a Micro Four Thirds sensor. It's bigger than the sensor you'd find in an action camera, but it's smaller than what you find in a DSLR, so the camera is still small and light. It also means customers will be able to pick and choose from a deep well of compatible lenses from companies like Olympus, Panasonic, and Sigma.   The weakest part of the E1 is its screen, which has a rough resolution of 320 x 240. (You can, however, use the company's mobile app to view your shot.) Also, the 2,000mAh battery only lasts about 45 minutes when filming in 4K, but it is replaceable. The camera runs a little warm, so it's likely not the best camera to hand hold. Zhang said the magnesium body should keep it from overheating, which can happen from time to time with a camera like a GoPro. The E1 will eventually retail for $699, and Z is offering bundles with a 14mm f2.5 Panasonic lens on Kickstarter. Zhang has high ambitions for his company — he says it's working on a waterproof housing, planning to upgrade the camera through continual firmware updates, and will run an open developer program around the camera's software. Z has created something unique with the E1, but longtime players in the Micro Four Thirds space already make reliable, affordable, 4K-capable cameras. How the upstart company handles what is an already successful Kickstarter will be a major factor in whether the camera can make an impact on the market.",0.770043533701958,0.229956466298042,0.17706160242328114,488,4.5840163934426226,280,5.5607142857142859,1,2,"Photography, Tech",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The device launched on Kickstarter today, and early backers can get in for $280 — not bad for an unlocked phone that the company claims rivals big-name flagships. The idea of ""crowdfunded smartphone"" is something no company has been able to nail down. Ubik is giving it a shot, and is dreaming up even bigger ambitions for what's next.  The Uno features a 1080p IPS display that's surrounded by a bezel so thin it's difficult to see on the sides. Seriously, the bezel is probably this thing's best ""feature."" It's got an octacore 2.2GHz MediaTek processor with 3GB of RAM and runs a version of Android that's 99 percent stock aside from Ubik's camera app (which wasn't ready during my demo time with the unit). Ubik claims the camera will be a strong performer thanks to its 20-megapixel Sony image sensor and f/2.2 aperture. Rounding out the spec sheet are an aluminum body, microSD card slot, Gorilla Glass 3 on the front, and a 3100mAh battery that supports quick charging — but you can't juice it up wirelessly. Still, from a hardware standpoint, the Ubik Uno is a pretty decent start for this unknown company. Ubik's parent company has dealt solely in the Korean market, but Ubik says this phone is designed for the US from top to bottom, supporting all the necessary bands you'd need on either AT&T or T-Mobile. Ubik says it'll be ready to start production immediately following the successful Kickstarter campaign, which is aiming to raise $200,000. The Uno will be priced at $345 once it reaches general availability. Ubik says it's ""the best Android Smartphone you'll be able to buy for the foreseeable future,"" though it's really hard to see how that's the case. New flagships like the Galaxy Note 5 and less expensive phones aimed at hardcore Android users like the OnePlus Two are on the way this summer. And if price isn't a pressing concern, better options like the LG G4 and Galaxy S6 can be bought today. But during our meeting, Ubik almost seemed more interested in what's to come after Uno. The company has lofty goals of becoming the first ""open source brand."" No, that doesn't mean it'll be releasing schematics and selling parts for its phone so you can assemble it and make modifications. What Ubik means by ""open source"" is that it will let community input decide what goes into its second smartphone. Want a higher resolution display, or OLED instead of LCD? Perhaps you'd like to see Ubik produce a non-phablet device, or stick with Qualcomm's more popular chipsets. You'll be able to make your voice heard through polls and in forums. Ubik says it aims to ""assign every function a price,"" and eventually let customers pick what they want (or don't) via a web tool. It'd be like MotoMaker, but for parts and internal components. Does all of that sound overly optimistic for a company yet to prove itself in the US? Absolutely. If it actually ships, will this thing get regular Android software updates? What will customer support look like? There are plenty of uncertainties, but that's what we're used to from any product that starts life through crowdfunding. This is the ambitious, dream big path Ubik sees for itself — assuming its Kickstarter goes well, anyway. The Uno is the first step, and deliveries are slated to start going out in September.

That's as long as potential patients know what they're getting into, and that any data resulting from the tests is shared with the scientific community, the group said.  ""Ebola outbreaks can be contained using available interventions like early detection and isolation, contact tracing and monitoring, and adherence to rigorous procedures of infection control,"" the WHO said in a statement. ""However, a specific treatment or vaccine would be a potent asset to counter the virus."" Canada to the rescue So far, that's been experimental serum called ZMapp co-developed by a pair of US and Canadian drug makers (as well as the US government and Canada's Public Health Agency), which has been used to treat some patients, despite not undergoing clinical trials with humans or gaining regulatory approval. Supplies of the drug have also dwindled due to difficulties producing it, though Canada today said it would donate 800 to 1,000 doses of the drug to be used in aid efforts. A separate drug called TKM-Ebola, which is also developed in Canada, could end up being used as well after getting a nod from the US Food and Drug Administration last week to restart human testing of the drug on those who are already infected.  Even with the decision, the WHO says it still needs to look into several other aspects dealing with experimental medications and therapies in response to the outbreak. That includes determining how and where the drugs are distributed, how to capture data from any use in the field, as well as how to ""prioritize the use"" of those drugs. According to the latest figures from the WHO, this outbreak has infected 1,848 people, killing 1,013 — making it the worst bout with ebola in recorded history.

So much so that a number of big technology companies including Apple, Samsung, and Google are now trying to help people harness data into something meaningful. Now you can add Intel to the list. Today the company announced a partnership with the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research that aims to track and analyze those with Parkinson's disease using wearable devices. The hope is to better monitor patterns and pick up on symptoms while potentially shedding more light on the disease to work on a cure. 1GB of data per person, each day The plan involves the creation of an app that will let patients record how they're feeling as well as log any medication they're taking. That will coincide with various activity data that's being tracked using wearables, which Intel estimates will be about 1GB per device, per day. ""With this approach, researchers could go from looking at a very small number of data points and burdensome pencil-and-paper patient diaries collected sporadically to analyzing hundreds of readings per second from thousands of patients and attaining a critical mass of data to detect patterns and make new discoveries,"" Intel said in a blog post announcing the partnership. The company's already tested out the plan at a smaller scale using 16 Parkinson's patients and nine volunteers that were part of a control group, all of whom were wearing Pebble watches during a four-day test. Using these devices, Intel hopes to record things like tremors, sleep patterns, gait, and balance at what is says is a rate of ""more than 300 observations per second."" The project is not entirely out of the blue for Intel. Early employee and former CEO Andy Grove was diagnosed with Parkinson's in 2000 and joined Fox's Foundation a year later. Since then, he's become an advisor there and donated millions to research efforts, including a $40 million potion of his estate. Intel says it will have a version of the app out later this year alongside a study that will make use of the wearable devices.

With this year's Shark Week programming beginning tonight, we thought this would be a good reminder of some of Discovery's more unpleasant tendencies.  Discovery’s Shark Week reached an important milestone this week: it hit an all-time ratings high, which the network partially attributes to an increase in female viewership. But instead of receiving acclaim, Discovery is getting pummeled by the media. A sample of recent headlines include ""Shark Week is once again making things up,"" ""Shark Week isn’t just misguided, it’s downright dangerous,"" and ""More Sharknado than Science."" Of course, this isn’t the first time Shark Week has experienced backlash for its negative portrayal of sharks and its tendency to rely on fiction rather than fact, as last year’s Megalodon documentary was widely trashed for suggesting that extinct sharks still roam Earth's waters. But this year feels different, perhaps because a number of shark scientists have begun to explain why they refuse to work with Discovery — and how Shark Week burned them in the past.      Jonathan Davis’ story is a prime example. His research was featured on Shark Week last year as part of a show called Voodoo Shark, which explored the existence of the ""Rooken"" — a fictional shark monster that dwells in the Louisiana Bayous. But, as io9 reported on Monday, Davis didn’t know that the producers were going to use his work to perpetuate a myth. In fact, he says, it wasn’t until his two-and-a-half hour interview with producers ended that he was asked, as an afterthought, what he thought of the voodoo shark. ""They portrayed it as though I believe in the Voodoo shark and that my research focused on searching for it."" ""The interviewer said, 'What do you think of this monster shark called the Rooken in South Louisiana,' and my answer was ‘That’s complete BS, there’s no such thing, I’ve never heard of it, but if I had I would know that it wasn’t true,’"" Davis explains. Then, the producer asked Davis about the existence of large bull sharks. He said that there could absolutely be large sharks in the area, even right behind them. It wasn’t until months later that he found out what had become of this answer. ""They chopped up the second question, and superimposed my second answer to the first question,"" he says. ""They showed a Southern hillbilly fisherman talking about the voodoo shark, and then they pan to me, saying, ‘Shark scientist Jonathan Davis believes that if the voodoo shark is here, it will be in the lake bayous.’"" Outraged, Davis tried to get in touch with Discovery, but they never answered his emails. ""They portrayed it as though I believed in the Voodoo shark and that my research focused on searching for it — the overall outlook of the show was terrible."" The Verge contacted Discovery to verify Davis’ story, but the network declined to address his assertions directly, stating instead: For 27 years Shark Week has been the prime showcase for all things shark – science, legend and conservation concerns. A whole generation that has grown up with shark week have awareness and issues for sharks; many marine biologists cite Shark Week as bringing them into that field. Discovery Channel has been one of the biggest contributors to furthering shark research and have paid for technology that has been critical in the studies. The production company that worked with Davis also got back to us, but they were equally vague: It’s our goal at Gurney Productions to work closely with marine experts and scientists worldwide. We strive to create awareness for the entire shark species. The more viewers we can bring to TV through Shark Week the more potential donations that will come to the table to help study and preserve these awesome creatures and fight the real problem — commercial shark fishing and finning. One might have expected to see less myth and more reality in this year’s shows. Unfortunately, this doesn’t seem to be the case, because as one zoologist explained in a blog post for Southern Fried Science, the documentary that explored the existence of the ""Shark Submarine"" on Sunday night is actually the product of a fictional story created by journalists in the 1970s. These journalists, Michelle Wcisel explains, wanted to demonstrate how easy it was to fool readers, so they made up a story about a large white shark in South Africa’s False Bay. Seeing the myth propagated onscreen in 2014, she writes, ""literally broke my heart to watch."" And so shark experts are speaking out. ""A number of years ago, I was in a project in which the focus was on the USS Indianapolis, the US cruiser that went down at the end of WWII,"" says George Burgess, director of the Florida Program for Shark Research at the Florida Museum of Natural History who has participated in Shark Week numerous times. Survivors of the wreckage were involved with sharks afterwards, he explains, so Discovery brought him in to speak to some of them. ""It was a hugely moving testimony from these guys and the film crew from the UK did a marvelous job from making a docu-drama out of it,"" he says. But when Discovery saw the finished product, they changed the name of the special to ""Ocean of Fear"" (Burgess doesn’t recall the original title, which he says was far less provocative), and asked for changes. ""They made the film crew go back and insert more scared-to-death guys in the water."" ""They made the film crew go back and insert more scared-to-death guys in the water, and injected it throughout the film to make it more scary,"" he says. But even after that show aired, Burgess continued to believe that Discovery could turn things around — until the Megalodon special aired last year. ""[Megalodon] was probably the final nail in the coffin as far as I was concerned,"" he says. ""I defended their programming, but it’s hard for me to do that now after such an overtly bad show that was put out for titillating purposes only, and clearly had no factual basis."" This year, Kristine Stump, a research associate at Shedd Aquarium, counts herself among those who have spoken out against Discovery’s practices. ""The basic premise was a camera crew was dropping in on real scientists doing actual hammerhead research,"" Stump told io9 about a special that aired Tuesday night. Instead, her work was featured on a special called Monster Hammerhead — one that Discovery says documents how ""a team of scientists and anglers look to explore the mystery and find out if the legend could be real."" Predictably, Stump said that the description ""does not match the description of what we filmed."" Despite the mounting criticism, Discovery still has supporters among members of the shark community. Eli Martinez, publisher and editor of Shark Diver Magazine, has worked with Discovery on multiple occasions, including this year. ""What I specialize in is interacting and working with sharks,"" he says. ""They didn’t ask me to do anything that I didn’t want to do."" ""They didn’t ask me to do anything that I didn’t want to do."" In fact, he says, the only pressure he feels comes from the shark community itself. ""They are calling me a sellout,"" he says, for participating in a special this year called Zombie Sharks (the name Discovery chose to represent tonic immobility — a phenomenon in which some sharks fall into a trance-like state when their noses are rubbed or when they're held belly-up). ""People don’t know what the show is about and just from the name alone, I’ve gotten some heat."" Moreover, he says, throwing Discovery under the bus for something that most nature and science channels do every day isn’t entirely fair. ""I remember sitting in a meeting at National Geographic and we started talking about bringing in the science and conservation people [for a show]."" But the minute Martinez’s team brought science up, they were told that National Geographic wanted to downplay that part as much as they could. ""They said, if I want to do this show, we need less science, and more of the excitement, fear, and fun of the animal."" As ratings continue to soar, it’s unlikely that Discovery will change its strategy. And given the current expert exodus away from Discovery’s programming, Shark Week might soon be a place that only gives voice to charlatans. ""If they don’t start adjusting their programming at a real-world level they will have less and less experts and substituting with more pseudo-experts,"" Burgess says. ""It’s kind of sad because the audience is already guaranteed and they are choosing this route."" Todd Cameron, an activist who recently swam 1,429 miles to raise awareness about the dire ecological situation sharks are facing, is one of the casualties of Discovery’s poor business practices. He, too, was approached by Discovery to participate in one of its shows, but turned the opportunity down. He took to Facebook in July to explain his decision:   Cameron told The Verge that Shark Week is ""very juvenile,"" adding that ""sharks are such a crucial species and 100 million are killed each year, you would think that Shark Week would be doing something educational."" He also takes issue with the way sharks are shown approaching researchers’ boats. ""You need to bait blue sharks for three hours just to see one,"" he says. ""If you don’t do that they have no reason to come up to the boat — that’s the reality of shark diving."" But Discovery rarely tells viewers this, he says, and they often omit vital pieces of information, like the fact that many species depicted in the shows never come near humans. ""They are taking an extremely skittish, docile, and shy animal like a tiger shark or a hammerhead shark and they are tuning it into a monster."" Researchers ""don’t want to be part of the hate."" Samantha Sherman, a marine biologist at James Cook University, says that Shark Week was ""the best week of the year"" growing up, but it has taken a distinct turn toward pseudoscience. As a result, she says, her colleagues have been less than forthcoming when producers have called them and asked for help. ""I have a couple friends that have been approached by Discovery and have turned it down because of where it’s going and the fear-mongering,"" she says. ""They don’t want to be part of the hate, or have their message misinterpreted so they have just said ‘no.'"" ""There is a distinct lack of well-published and highly-regarded shark scientists involved in the programming,"" said Christine Dudgeon, a leopard shark ecologist at the University of Queensland in Australia, in an email to The Verge. Instead of focusing on the science, she says, they show shark attacks — which, for the record, are still rare, despite a recent increase (between 2006 and 2010, an average of 4.2 fatal shark attacks occurred each year). This begs the question: could Discovery maintain its current success without relying on sensationalism? According to Sherman, there’s more than enough exciting shark science to fuel such an endeavor. ""There are so many other sharks out there — sharks that can do things that most people wouldn't believe, like glow blue."" With over 400 species of sharks in existence, she says, it’s unfortunate that Shark Week often only profiles three or four. But content is only one side of the coin: viewers have to tune in, too. A change in Discovery's strategy would probably be welcomed by experts, but would likely mean a drop in ratings over time. ""The TV world isn't putting anything out there that the audience isn’t asking for,"" Martinez says. ""I mean look at Sharknado! It’s horrible, but the audience loved it enough to make a second one.""",0.4543938669276607,0.5456061330723393,0.25904522954715864,1987,4.9325616507297436,873,6.4020618556701034,1,2,"Culture, Entertainment, Science, Report",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

According to a new study, published today in Science, a parasitic plant called the strangleweed is capable of not only sucking out genetic material from the host plant it invades, but also injecting its own genetic material into its host. This, the researchers say, could simply be a means by which these organisms obtain energy from one another. But a far more interesting possibility is the idea that this might represent an entirely new form of plant communication — one that might give humans an edge when trying to curb invasions from parasitic plants. ""The typical way that plants communicate is through chemicals that they release through their leaves and roots,"" says James Westwood, a plant physiologist at Virginia Tech and a co-author of the study. ""So to find out that there is an exchange of RNA"" — the intermediary form of genetic information that fills the gap between DNA and proteins — ""is a new concept that hasn’t been explored at all."" hacking the host plants’ entire system Beyond the novelty of this finding, however, lie the potential agricultural applications, Westwood says. Researchers might be able to use the exchange of RNA to provide host plants with their very own defense mechanism. In the study, Westwood’s team sequenced tissue samples from host tomato plants and strangleweed, which invade various plant species by wrapping themselves around a host and invading their vascular system. Both the strangleweed and the tomato plants’ genome have already been fully sequenced, so researchers were able to compare the RNAs contained in samples with corresponding DNA sequences in the genome. ""We figured it out by process of elimination, and sorting out the sequences that weren’t substantially different from those in the full genome,"" Westwood says. Using this technique, the researchers determined that thousands of RNA sequences are likely exchanged between host and parasite during the invasion process. ""It’s surprising for a number of reasons,"" Westwood says. ""The first being that if you think of a parasite as truly being a parasite, you wouldn’t expect to see movement of genetic material into the host — just the parasite sucking nutrients from the host."" And then there's the sheer volume of information being exchanged. Westwood’s team had previously been able to identify a few RNA sequences in parasite tissues. But the fact that thousands of bulky RNAs are potentially exchanged between the plants is astonishing, Westwood says. ""It’s such a substantial amount of movement."" And because the materials being exchanged are really information molecules, it’s possible that the parasite is using its own RNAs for espionage, as well as for hacking the host plants’ entire system. ""The parasite is basically sending information into the enemy’s house,"" Westwood says — information that can soften cell walls, for example, making it easier for the parasite to invade the host and make connections. ""It’s very logical the RNAs would be working to help the parasite establish itself in the host,"" he says. And it’s this possibility that opens up so many doors for parasite control. ""What you could do is create a host crop that produces short RNA sequences that are specific against the parasite — you’d be helping it build its own defense system,"" he says. At the moment, farmers use herbicides to prevent strangleweed from ravaging tomato plants, alfalfa, and cranberry plants. So using this exchange of genetic material to our advantage could avoid these types of chemicals. ""with extensive RNA movement, many parasite processes could be targeted in control strategies."" Creating similar genetic weapons has actually been attempted with individual genes in the past, says Neelima Sinha, a plant biologist at the University of California Davis who did not participate in the study. But ""this report now suggests that with extensive RNA movement, many parasite processes could be targeted in control strategies."" Unfortunately, researchers haven’t proved that the exchanged RNAs are used as information yet, so it’s possible they’re way off track. But because of the inherent nature of RNAs, Westwood thinks it’s likely that the host plants are producing proteins using each other’s genetic information. ""It’s like stealing memos from the competition,"" Westwood says. ""You can either read them or burn the paper as fuel."" For obvious reasons, Westwood is hoping for the former. ""We thought 'maybe we could get published in Science!'"" But before anyone can even consider creating plants with built-in defense mechanisms, Westwood and his team will have to demonstrate that the exchanged RNAs are truly being encoded by recipient plants. This won’t be easy, Westwood says, because researchers will have to distinguish the proteins that the parasite is making thanks to its own RNA from the proteins that it might be making thanks to host RNAs. ""It is more challenging to definitely answer whether a protein has been made from a mobile RNA versus the protein having just drifted in by itself,"" he says. One process that researchers will attempt is catching the RNAs as they become proteins.  For now, however, Westwood is still joyful about the novelty of the finding itself, regardless of the eventual outcome or human applications. ""We were very excited when we saw the results. I never expected that we would find so many RNA sequences in the host plant,"" he says. ""We thought ‘maybe we will get published in Science!’""   Correction: A previous version of this article stated that James Westwood conducts his research at Harvard University.

But until recently that goal had really only been achieved over short distances. Now, a new study, published today in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, brings us that much closer to chemical-detecting planes, as researchers were able to use a single shot of laser light to detect individual chemicals located 1 kilometer (0.6 miles) away. ""This opens up the door to an entirely new method for remote sensing,"" said Vladislav Yakovlev, a biomedical engineer at Texas A&M University and a co-author of the study, in an email to The Verge. Previous studies have described similar laser sensing technologies, he said, but ""No one has been able to obtain such long distances, and especially not on a single-shot basis."" ""No one has been able to obtain such long distances."" The technique makes use of ""Raman scattering,"" a physical phenomenon that involves light passing through a material, causing it to vibrate at a level that’s specific to the molecules contained in the material. The ensuing scattering of light causes a color change in a small percentage of the laser pulses that hit the target. ""The color change of the light is unique to the specific chemical,"" Yakovlev explained, ""so we then detect the color of the light and that allows us to identify the specific chemical."" This is allowed the scientists to differentiate similar-looking powders like ammonium nitrate and sodium nitrate — both of which can be used to make bombs — from 400 meters (0.2 miles) away. Right now, the whole system can be assembled for around $30,000, but the researchers hope to make it more ""real-world friendly"" over the course of the next few years. To do this, however, they will have to identify which conditions are optimal for irradiation in addition to making sure that the device can identify mixtures of chemicals as accurately as it can identify individual components. And it's reasonably safe, the researchers say, as the only real potential for harm is the effect that the laser might have on human eyes — something that operators can avoid by wearing eye protection. Regulators could detect fertilizers from the comfort of a plane's cockpit ""Remote detection of explosives is a really big thing,"" Yakolvev said. ""Our hope is that this technique will allow for the detection of hazardous chemicals from a safe distance in real time."" The military applications for a device like this are pretty obvious, but there are many non-military applications as well. Law enforcement might be able to use the system to detect drugs, for instance. ""Considering that it takes just one laser shot to quantify the presence of specific compounds on a ground,"" Yakovlev said, ""one can imagine mapping the large area quickly identifying locating and quantifying the presence of such compounds"" from the comfort of a plane's cockpit. It could even be used in future space missions to Mars, he said.

Sharks have been drawn to undersea fiber-optic cabling since the connections were first laid down. The New York Times reported in 1987 that shark attacks had caused the failure of four segments of brand new cabling, and an experimental cable placed in 1985 was discovered to have shark teeth embedded in it. The behaviour has been observed more recently, with footage from a remotely operated submersible uploaded in 2010 showing a large shark clamping its jaws around a segment of thick cabling, before swimming away.  There's no conclusive reasoning as to why sharks are trying to disrupt our internet connections, but it's been theorized that they are drawn by the magnetic fields generated by the high voltage running through the cables. Sharks have a biological ability to detect electromagnetic fields. The ability, called electroreception, usually allows sharks to detect the weak bioelectric fields generated by fish so they can hunt them down in the ocean. But while most cables are shielded to supposedly prevent such electrical fields from being detectable, it appears the sharks may have some way of picking up the signals, leading to the predators getting mixed up between miles of undersea cabling and a meal.",0.22183972730505175,0.7781602726949483,0.8503791079416073,262,5.2442748091603058,173,6.0289017341040463,0,0,"Google, Science, Tech",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

""Some big ISPs are extracting a toll because they can — they effectively control access to millions of consumers."" he wrote. This toll, says Hastings, violates Netflix’s definition of true and total net neutrality. So why did Netflix agree, just one month earlier, to pay Comcast and violate its own stated principles? According to Hastings, ""Netflix believes strong net neutrality is critical, but in the near term we will in cases pay the toll to the powerful ISPs to protect our consumer experience."" That is certainly part of the truth. Given Comcast’s massive size, Netflix could no longer afford to have so many customers suffering poor service.  ""Some big ISPs are extracting a toll because they can."" But informed speculation would suggest there is also a more opportunistic strategy at play here. Netflix had been negotiating with the major American ISPs for two years over these fees. What if the deal happened now because Comcast, under intense regulatory scrutiny over its proposed merger with Time Warner, finally came to the table with terms Netflix could agree to? Is it possible Hastings saw the chance to strike a deal with the devil, abandoning his own stated principles to capture a bargain at a moment of maximum leverage?     To understand the Netflix–Comcast deal, we need to back up and explain the way traffic moves around the internet. Big internet companies like Google, Microsoft, Facebook, and Netflix have traditionally relied on a three-party system for delivering that data to its final destination. Because they don't own any physical pipes themselves, they pay a middleman — a company like Cogent or Level 3 — to transmit their data to an ISP, which then takes it the last mile into customers’ living rooms. Comcast and companies like Cogent have what’s known as a peering arrangement: they agree to share an equal amount of data back and forth across their networks instead of paying one another to transport it. Netflix traffic overwhelmed the peering arrangement The problem was that Netflix had become enormous, sending over one-third of all US internet traffic during prime-time viewing hours. This was overwhelming the peering arrangement, causing congestion in the places where Cogent and Level3 connected to Comcast's network. Netflix service to customers was suffering as a result. Someone needed to pay to upgrade the infrastructure. (You can find a deeper dive into the situation at StreamingMedia.) The recent post by Hastings and similar ones from Cogent and Level 3 argue that the ISPs should be responsible for the cost of upgrading their networks so that data gets to customers at the speed and quality promised. Comcast and other ISPs like AT&T, which fired back in a blog post of its own last week, want Netflix or Cogent to pay for upgrades to its network that would allow it to handle the extra volume. ""As we all know, there is no free lunch, and there’s also no cost-free delivery of streaming movies,"" wrote AT&T’s Jim Cicconi. ""Mr. Hastings’ arrogant proposition is that everyone else should pay but Netflix.  That may be a nice deal if he can get it.  But it’s not how the internet, or telecommunication for that matter, has ever worked."" ""There is no free lunch."" Netflix proposed that, instead of paying for new interconnections, it could reduce congestion by working with ISPs through a program it created called Open Connect, which would place Netflix hardware directly in the data centers of big ISPs to ease the load on their networks. Netflix offered to pay the cost of installing and maintaining this hardware, but while Open Connect had some success in Europe and with smaller American ISPs like Cablevision,  the big three — Comcast, Verizon, and AT&T — declined to participate, and asked to be paid for the privilege of giving Netflix a new interconnection instead.     So what changed? After nearly two years of stalled negotiations, Comcast and Netflix finally reached a deal one month ago, less than two weeks after Comcast announced its intent to buy Time Warner Cable. Perhaps the two events had nothing to do with one another, but it seems more likely that Netflix was finally able to extract terms from Comcast it found favorable enough to agree to. The price tag certainly backs this up. Wedbush Securities estimates Netflix is paying between $25 million and $50 million a year to Comcast, and industry analysts like Frost and Sullivan’s Dan Rayburn think the cost to Netflix could be as low as $12 million a year. That estimate is supported by the fact that Netflix has not filed any notice with the SEC altering its guidance for this quarter’s financial performance: if it was suddenly doling out a big new chunk of change to Comcast, Netflix would be legally obligated to let its shareholders and the public know. Netflix saw its chance to lock in a killer deal While it has not been publicly disclosed, Netflix didn’t just get a good price, it also got a long-term commitment that helps to future-proof the arrangement. Sources familiar with the deal tell The Verge that it locks in attractive pricing for a number of years and leaves room for significant expansion, as Netflix projects its US subscriber base could grow from the roughly 30 million today to between 60 and 90 million customers within the next decade.     If Netflix got such a good deal, why is it now publicly bashing Comcast and the very bargain it struck? First, Netflix hasn’t done a deal with the nation’s two other biggest ISPs, Verizon and AT&T. Immediately after the Comcast deal was made public, both of those companies told the press they expected to strike a similar payment agreement with Netflix in the near future. But Netflix doesn’t have the kind of leverage over these companies it likely had with Comcast, and so the parties are likely no closer to an agreement than they have been for the past two years since Netflix launched Open Connect. Hastings’ blog post is sending a clear signal that, while Netflix did see a bargain it could accept with Comcast, it isn’t going to settle up with Verizon or AT&T any time soon — at least not at the price they’ve been asking. Netflix also knows that in the future the leverage it has over Comcast may not be so strong. When that current deal expires, the ""tolls"" extracted for interconnectivity could get much steeper. And so Hastings is trying to push for legal and legislative changes that would allow the FCC, under the auspices of net neutrality, to eliminate these costs for Netflix altogether. Hastings took a gamble Hastings took a gamble. By agreeing to pay Comcast, he may have set a painful precedent. The Netflix deal allowed the ISPs to claim that fees for interconnection are good business. ""To me this shows you don't necessarily need a lot of regulation in a dynamic market here,"" Verizon CEO Lowell McAdam told CNBC. ""By doing these commercial deals we'll get good investments and good returns for both parties."" A new report this morning shows that Comcast is pushing ahead with this model, conducting talks with Apple about providing a ""fast lane"" for data to its new TV service that would avoid internet ""congestion."" But it’s hard to blame Hastings for seizing his opportunity to strike a deal with Comcast while the getting was good. After a recent circuit court decision gutted what remained of net neutrality’s existing legal standing, and with Comcast poised to swallow up major markets like New York City with the Time Warner Cable deal, he saw the writing on the wall. The arrangement with Comcast provides Netflix much-needed breathing room as the battlefield is set for a much bigger showdown over the scope and power of net neutrality in America.",0.32236537790969466,0.6776346220903053,0.848146071065241,1366,4.9040995607613471,635,6.2771653543307089,0,0,"Business, Policy & Law, US & World, Report",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

Other colonists are handling food, water, and shelter — the big stuff. All you need to do is set them up with working cellphones. There's no AT&T on Mars Of course, there's no AT&T on Mars, so you'll have to set up your own cell towers, but probably not as many as you'd think. You can stick to a Wi-Fi network on the main base with just a few towers for outer regions, putting up a new one every time a new region is explored. Since you own the towers, you can also skip charming earthly quirks like texting caps and tethering charges, just instituting basic fees to cover access to the network at large. (It's a market-based colony.) Anyone calling within the station can do it entirely on the Wi-Fi network. You also won’t be privileging voice calls, so you don’t need a distinction between your phone number, your email, and your screen names on various services. You can rely on just a single data channel and a single handle, which might also cut down on overall usage since you're not being nudged towards bandwidth-intensive services like voice calling anymore. And with the bulk of the traffic flowing over internal Wi-Fi, there will be a lot less data to be moved overall. The point being, your Martian cellphone carrier could very well end up better, cheaper, and more sensibly organized than the one you're dealing with on Earth. Your Martian cellphone carrier could be better than the one you're dealing with on Earth This, roughly, is the starting point for Signal, a new service currently in public alpha. From the outside, it looks like an ambitious kind of phone-service-meets-mesh-network. Instead of working by phone numbers or emails, you get a new Signal screen name prefaced by a ^ symbol, the equivalent of Twitter's @. Send a message to ^russellbrandom (or russell.theverge.com if you want to tie it to a domain), and the web’s DNS infrastructure will route it to my Signal server, which can forward it to my phone, my tablet, my computer, or wherever else I've programmed messages to go. Instead of separating out texts, calls, and third-party app messages, they all end up in the same place. Phone service meets mesh networking More importantly, most of it’s free. The main offering is free voice calling to anywhere in the world, like Skype but over traditional phone lines. In the coming months, Signal will roll out a dialer replacement for Android, along with an app for iOS and a browser plugin for the web. If you want a traditional data plan or a connection to a traditional telco network, you can buy it from SignalThis, a third-party company that’s launching as a competing service inside the Signal network, betting that customers will pay more for a more extensive network. It won’t be free, but it may still end up cheaper than a standard phone bill. Peer to peer usage is the Martian scenario That might seem simple enough, but behind the scenes, Signal is doing some pretty weird stuff. The company is signed up as a non-profit virtual operator with Sprint, so if you want to use it as a simple pay-as-you-go phone, you can. (Signal is hoping for deals with the other major carriers as the platform expands.) But if you want to move away from the carrier, shifting more and more of your coverage to local Wi-Fi networks, Signal makes it much easier than a conventional carrier. You can also cut Signal's hardware out of the picture completely, hosting your own Signal server and relying on your own Wi-Fi-powered cell tower for connectivity. Signal has designed the towers to talk to each other, so you could eventually call a friend without leaving Signal’s infrastructure at all. ""It will be exciting to see the peer-to-peer usage between users hosting their own signals,"" says founder Andy Myers. ""That's really the goal of all this."" It’s the Martian scenario or, as Myers puts it, a cell network for the zombie apocalypse. That restructuring also means you can pull off tricks that would be impossible on a conventional phone network, like issuing a universal do-not-disturb or limiting certain callers to certain devices. Your texts and calls are all managed by the same central Signal server, so it can route them however it wants. That gives you total control over how and when you get notifications. If you want a total call blackout between midnight and 5AM, all you have to do is tell the server. Reaching critical mass is notoriously difficult The most immediate problem is adoption. Myers’ plan will work great once he’s got 100,000 users and a Signal tower on every block, but reaching that critical mass is notoriously difficult, as hundreds of failed apps and social networks can attest. At the moment, Myers is banking on ambitious gearheads and open standards to fill the gap. Anyone can build an app or a business on top of Signal’s architecture, and the organization is currently trying to enlist as many partners as it can before it launches its beta in May. Ultimately, Myers sees Signal growing into an open protocol, a kind of HTTP for the mobile age, but before it gets there, he’s going to need a lot of consumers on his side. Telecoms have been fighting off disruption for decades The bigger problem is, well, the phone industry. Myers says he expects carriers to welcome Signal with open arms, but so far, Sprint is the only one that’s taken the bait. ""Sprint is really the most innovative carrier out there in many ways,"" Myers says — but not coincidentally, they’re also one of the smallest of the Big Five. Signal’s offering a better way to move data, but it’s not at all clear the carriers will be interested, and a small nonprofit like Signal won’t have enough clout to make them change their minds. It’s an exciting idea, but the telecoms have been successfully fighting off this kind of disruption for decades now. Which puts us back at the beginning, building cell towers for Mars. Signal’s grand vision sounds incredible, but Earth might not be ready for it any time soon.",0.6262288776670295,0.3737711223329705,0.15671828040826152,1062,4.7711864406779663,520,6.0884615384615381,0,0,"Business, Report",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

But as the community recovers, it's left a single, thorny question unanswered: who took $400 million worth of bitcoins from Mt Gox's vault? On Monday at around 11PM Mt. Gox, the largest exchange for trading the virtual currency Bitcoin, started disappearing piece by piece. First the homepage disappeared. Next the support page was pulled, followed by the press releases and then the API. ""The requested page was not found on this server,"" customers were told when they tried to access their deposits. Users started to panic as they realized they might never get their bitcoins back. It had been a rough month for Gox. The company froze... The woeful situation for Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox, which went offline earlier today, is seemingly no close to getting better. A pair of reports suggest that the company is now being investigated by prosecutors in the US as well as Japan, while another suggests that it could have indeed lost over 744,000 Bitcoins in a theft several years ago. Citing an unnamed source, The Wall Street Journal says federal prosecutors subpoenaed Mt. Gox sometime this month, asking it to preserve documents. One... The embattled Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox has gone offline, after several organizations from the Bitcoin community released a joint statement distancing themselves from the Tokyo company's troubles. Mt. Gox's website remains inaccessible, and the exchange appears to have deleted its entire Twitter feed. The joint statement was originally billed as ""regarding the insolvency of Mt. Gox,"" but was later updated to remove that language. A spokesman for the group told Recode, however, that ""Mt. Gox... Mt. Gox, once the largest Bitcoin exchange in the world, is operated from an unmarked Tokyo office block that offers no indication of its major, controversial influence on the digital currency's health. No indication, that is, unless you've walked past the headquarters in the past week, where protesters are attempting to draw unwelcome attention to the company's existence. ""Mt. Gox: Where is our Money,"" reads one sign. ""Mt. Gox: Are you solvent?"" reads another. What's going on?  Bitcoin exchange Mt Gox first halted withdrawals two days ago, spurring a selling panic and furious speculation — but now, they've finally come clean about why. In a post this morning, the team said it noticed a currency-wide vulnerability called ""transaction malleability"" that would allow a user to alter transaction details to make it seem as if a transfer failed when it had actually succeeded. Since users regularly report to exchanges that particular transactions did not go through, it... The popular Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox is suspending withdrawals for an unstated period of time in order to perform maintenance. The exchange hopes to resolve withdrawal delays that some users have been complaining about for months now, which have allegedly held up transactions for weeks or longer.

Of the 119 prisoners detained by the CIA, more than one in five were wrongfully imprisoned, while CIA interrogators ran through a host of barbaric tactics including Russian roulette, shoving hummus up a detainee's rectum, and simply leaving targets to freeze to death in an unheated cell. And while all of it was happening, many officials within the agency harbored real doubts about whether the program was working at all. Today, John Kiriakou is in federal prison You've probably seen these details pass across Twitter three or four times by now, but it's worth thinking about what they really mean, and what it means that this program went on for so many years, sucking in hundreds of people who had never imagined themselves as torturers before now. In one note from the report, President Bush is troubled by the sight of a man chained to the ceiling, wearing a diaper, and soiling himself. Surely Bush wasn't the only one to see the picture and recoil. But it didn't matter. The machine kept turning. You start to wonder how it kept going so long. Why didn't someone do something? The short answer is that someone did. Before this report, most of what we knew about the torture program came from a string of leaks in 2006 and 2007. One CIA employee took a particularly visible stand, an analyst named John Kiriakou who had run the agency's counterterrorism activities in Pakistan. Kiriakou left the agency after the water-boarding of Abu Zubadayah and became a public critic of the practice. He also became a valuable source for news outlets hungry for details, and appeared on ABC in 2007 to talk about the agency's troubling advanced interrogation techniques. Today, John Kiriakou is in a federal prison in Loretto, Pennsylvania, serving two and a half years for disclosing classified information — confirming the name of a CIA agent to a New York Times reporter. Facing 30 years, he took a plea deal for 30 months. He has five children, and it's been difficult to see them while he's been inside. He's scheduled to move to house arrest in February, before his sentence finishes up in May. Already, it seems unlikely that anyone of the interrogators revealed today will have to face the same troubles. The same Attorney General that put Kiriakou in jail has already declined to prosecute any of his colleagues. The international courts have called for prosecutions, but it's unlikely they'll come to anything. It seems absurd to say that what Kiriakou did was more criminal than what the interrogators did, but politics has never shied away from the absurd. It's worth remembering Kiriakou not as a call for retribution or even justice, but just to make sense of what happened. Why were we so committed to useless atrocities? Why did it take six years to give up practices that had been outlawed for decades? Why was it so hard to stop doing the wrong thing?

As the new report makes clear, CIA officials lied to Congress over and over in defense of the program, whether it was to make torture seem more effective, less brutal, or more legally sanctioned than it really was, making it impossible for the legislature to provide effective oversight. Here are the eight biggest lies, noted with frustration over and over again throughout the report. It's an incomplete list, but an important one to keep in mind if there's ever going to be a meaningful check on the power of US intelligence agencies. The Senate first started asking questions about CIA detention sites after 9/11, when rumors started circulating about plans for an unorthodox interrogation program. In the first briefing, on November 13, 2001, Deputy Director of Operations James Pavitt ""assured the [Senate Intelligence] Committee that it would be informed of each individual who entered CIA custody."" Pavitt also disavowed the use of torture. The following April, the CIA told the committee on the record that the agency ""has no current plans to develop a detention facility."" In fact, the CIA was already holding Abu Zubaydah at a detention site in a still-undisclosed location. After the House voted to limit CIA interrogations to only previously authorized techniques in February of 2008, Hayden told the committee that the CIA had detained fewer than 100 people. The report now names 119 people detained from 2002 to 2008. The most damning piece of evidence against torture was the videotapes of early CIA interrogations, made to establish a record for any subsequent prosecution. The CIA destroyed the tapes on November 8th, 2005, to prevent them from falling into the hands of an independent investigatory commission that had been proposed by Senator Carl Levin. Asked about the tapes at a briefing a year later, CIA officials testified that ""the CIA did not videotape interrogations,"" striking any mention of the tapes. In a 2007 statement, CIA director Michael Hayden told Congress that ""[a]s CIA's efforts to implement [new interrogation] authorities got underway in 2002, the majority and minority leaders of the Senate, the speaker and the minority leader of the House, and the chairs and ranking members of the intelligence committees were fully briefed on the interrogation program."" As Marcy Wheeler has pointed out, then-Senate Majority leader Tom Daschle and House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt were never briefed on the program. House speaker Dennis Hastert and Senate minority leader Trent Lott weren’t briefed until 2005 and 2006, respectively. In the same statement, Hayden said the CIA interrogators were ""carefully chosen and screened for demonstrated professional judgment and maturity,"" and that ""they must complete more than 250 hours of specialized training before they are allowed to come face-to-face with a terrorist."" Based on the committee’s findings, that’s just not true: several interrogators had histories of inappropriate questioning tactics, anger management issues, and sexual assault. ""The CIA used poorly trained and non-vetted personnel,"" Feinstein told reporters today. ""It’s a clear fact that the CIA deployed officers who had histories of personal, ethical and professional problems of a serious nature."" On November 16th, 2006, CIA director Hayden told the committee that detainees were never provided fewer than 1,000 calories per day. In fact, calorie requirements weren't instituted until March of 2004, a full two years into the program, and previous documents suggest withholding food for 1-2 days as an acceptable ""adjunct to interrogation."" In the same briefing, an unnamed official testified that standing sleep deprivation was discontinued whenever swelling or any abnormality appeared. But in the case of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, standing sleep deprivation continued through the outbreak of edema on his feet as well as abrasions on his ankles, shins, wrists and the back of his head. CIA director Hayden also testified that ""mental conditions that would be of normal concern do not present themselves until a person has experienced more than 100 hours of sleep deprivation."" At least three detainees experienced hallucinations after less than 96 hours of sleep deprivation over the course of the CIA's program. In February 2003, the CIA briefed Senator Pat Roberts on the interrogation program, looking to gain his support: According to the committee, those claims don't hold up: ""Abu Zubaydah and al-Nashiri did not provide actionable intelligence on ongoing plotting."" Similar briefings took place over and over, and similar distortions were made, inflating Zubaydah's stature within Al Qaeda or concocting to a ""second wave"" of terrorist attacks that were stopped thanks to intelligence from Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. In each case, the committee says the CIA's characterizations were inaccurate, relying on exaggerations to protect the program. The result was a skewed view of the CIA's effectiveness and a general ignorance of the program's worst excesses, many of which are only now being brought to light.",0.5958106149319897,0.4041893850680103,0.839347641662747,829,5.3787696019300366,462,6.6298701298701301,0,0,"US & World, National Security",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

But even as the evidence piles up, it’s seeming more and more likely that that attackers will get away clean. Whoever leaked the files was working out of Bangkok First, there are reasons for thinking North Korea is to blame. On Sunday, Bloomberg reported that one of the core IP addresses involved in leaking the Sony files belongs to the private network of the St. Regis Hotel in Bangkok, Thailand. For practical reasons, it seems unlikely that anyone was running a VPN or a Tor node out of a hotel room, so it strongly suggests whoever leaked the files was operating out of the St. Regis. That's been taken as evidence that the attackers were aligned with North Korea, since the country's Korea Computer Center has branches in China, Syria, and the UAE and has a history of working out of hotels. The strongest competing theory is that the attack is the work of Anonymous-style activists with a grudge against Sony, but it would be a remarkably sophisticated tactic for such groups, which tend to rely on Tor and VPN services for anonymity. Then, there's been the ongoing work of whoever was behind the attacks. On Friday, Sony Pictures employees received an unsettling mass email threatening their families if they did not publicly renounce the company. As with previous messages, there was no stated goal besides ""removing Sony Pictures on Earth."" The email addresses have been circulating over torrent sites, so it could have been a particularly foolhardy 4channer, but given similarities to previous messages, it seems unlikely — and if this is an Anonymous-style activist group, they're a lot more cryptic and a lot more bloodthirsty than anything we've seen before. There was no stated goal besides ""removing Sony Pictures on Earth."" Whoever is behind the attacks has a specific grudge against Sony, and is more interested in revenge than making money or gathering information. After the public spat over The Interview — which came with specific warnings of retaliation — it’s hard to think of anyone but North Korea that fits the profile. The North Korean government has also issued a string of less-than-convincing denials, ranging from an early ""wait and see"" to a more recent statement in which a spokesman called the hack an ""act of justice,"" denying official involvement but admitting that it may have been carried out by the country's supporters. The news comes on top of previous evidence that the specific program that wiped Sony's computers was written in Korean. The attack also bears a striking resemblance to previous North Korean attacks, in both the specific details of the code and the previously unknown hacker group claiming responsibility. Bloomberg points to three previous attacks linked to North Korea that purported to be from previously unknown activist groups, one of which actually shares a server with the current attack. That pileup of evidence has led many observers (including me) to conclude that North Korea is almost certainly behind the attacks — but not everyone is convinced. Digital attacks rarely leave a smoking gun, particularly when the target is as defenseless as Sony Pictures was, so it's unlikely that we'll get any evidence that's more definitive than what we already have. Digital attacks rarely leave a smoking gun Even with the abundance of circumstantial evidence, North Korea probably won’t face real repercussions from the attack. Last week, Sony seemed primed to accuse North Korea directly, only to back off at the last minute. North Korea has inched around the topic in its statements, offering less-definitive denials than anyone expected. The country is already a diplomatic pariah, so there's not much the State Department or the United Nations could do even if they wanted to retaliate. Naming the country directly would just be forcing an already awkward issue. Besides, there's no political upside in antagonizing a dictatorship. Better to leave it unsaid. We've heard this line before after a mysterious digital attack. Stuxnet is generally assumed to be American, although it would be difficult to prove it in court. The surveillance malware that targeted The New York Times last year almost certainly came from the Chinese government, but the proof was circumstantial enough that it was hard to enforce any repercussions from the attack. There are others: Ghostnet from China, Turla from Russia, The Mask from Spain. Each did real damage, but did so with enough deniability that no one knew exactly how to respond. The breathtaking attack on Sony Pictures seems poised to join that pile. We know what happened, and we know where to look to find the people behind it, but we still don’t know quite enough. It's a frightening fact about digital attacks: for the most part, people still get away with them.",0.32354235566156375,0.6764576443384362,0.18965907741026436,829,5.0482509047044628,418,6.232057416267943,0,0,"US & World, National Security",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

The report's key findings were leaked months ago and discussed long before that: parts of the CIA's enhanced interrogation program, which involved techniques like waterboarding, stress positions, and sleep deprivation, qualified as torture; the CIA misrepresented the nature of its programs to the public; and the program failed to yield effective intelligence that would have justified its existence. A declassified 500-page executive summary of the 6,700-page report, whose development was led by Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), is available on the Senate's site. The report says that the CIA subjected 39 prisoners to ""enhanced interrogation,"" but that officers regularly questioned whether it produced accurate information, while misrepresenting its results to the White House, Congress, and others. The Intelligence Committee looked into 20 of its supposed successes and ""found them to be wrong in fundamental aspects"" — some of the information was already known, some false, some had already been given by subjects under ordinary interrogation, and the plots that it supposedly stopped either weren't feasible in the first place or would likely never have been put into action. And despite a recommendation by the CIA inspector general, the agency ""never conducted a credible, comprehensive analysis of the effectiveness of its enhanced interrogation techniques."" The interrogation methods, meanwhile, were brutal — the report includes graphic details of ""near drownings,"" beatings, and week-long sleep deprivation sessions that sometimes continued after prisoners had begun to hallucinate. Confusion and poor record-keeping kept CIA oversight and leadership in the dark about the program's operations, and staff with ""no relevant experience"" were put in charge of sites. In 2002, a detainee died of suspected hypothermia while ""partially nude and chained to a concrete floor;"" later, CIA leaders admitted they had ""little or no awareness of operations"" at the site in question. The CIA downplayed the harshness of ""enhanced interrogations"" and dodged investigations by the White House and Congress, withholding information from top officials. According to one email, it did not initially brief then-Secretary of State Colin Powell on the program details, because the White House was concerned he would ""blow his stack,"" and it refused to say where its detention facilities were located or where it was negotiating to build new ones, in two cases telling local officials not to talk to US ambassadors about the negotiations. The CIA's success stories were 'wrong in fundamental aspects' The Senate has been working on the report since 2009, initially planning to spend one year researching and compiling it. In the years since, it's been in a tug of war with the CIA, which Feinstein alleged had tried to block access to potentially damaging records and even hacked into the Intelligence Committee's computer network to see what it had found. This summer, CIA director John Brennan issued an apology for inappropriate behavior by CIA staff, saying he was looking into disciplinary action. Getting approval to declassify it has also been an arduous process. The Intelligence Committee voted to release a summary in April of 2014, but it then spent months fighting attempts to redact what Senator Feinstein called ""key facts that support the report's findings and conclusions."" Most recently, Secretary of State John Kerry reportedly asked to delay the report for fear it could spark violence overseas, though a State Department spokesperson later denied that he had done so. According to Feinstein, the final summary contains 93 percent of the information the Senate wanted to include, the remainder redacted to protect national security. President Obama banned enhanced interrogation after taking office in 2009, but he was leery of prosecuting anyone involved in it during the Bush administration, saying that ""we need to look forward as opposed to looking backwards."" Years earlier, a CIA officer had also decided to destroy interrogation tapes that allegedly showed waterboarding; in 2010, the Justice Department completed an investigation of that incident and decided not to file charges. The Senate's reporting, however, grew out of a 2007 probe on the tapes' destruction. In a statement today, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper defended the intelligence community but admitted mistakes: The officers who participated in the program believed with certainty that they were engaged in a program devised by our government on behalf of the President that was necessary to protect the nation, that had appropriate legal authorization, and that was sanctioned by at least some in the Congress.  But, as President Obama has made clear, some things were done that should not have been done — and which transgressed our values.  We recognized this ten years ago and stopped the program as it was originally conducted; even more important, we have since enacted laws, implemented Presidential orders and established internal policies to ensure that such things never happen again. Obama has continued to stand by the CIA, but he said in August that the US ""crossed a line"" by using interrogation techniques that ""any fair-minded person would believe were torture."" The White House released a statement today supporting the report, but presenting it as a way to close the books on an embarrassing episode in American history rather than evidence for a new debate. ""Rather than another reason to refight old arguments, I hope that today's report can help us leave these techniques where they belong — in the past,"" it said.

The screenings, which companies like Amazon use to quell employee theft, can take up to 25 minutes according to the lawsuit originally filed in 2010. Though Amazon is at the forefront of the decision, the original lawsuit was filed against Integrity Staffing Solutions, a company that provides staffing and warehouse space to the online retailer. The plaintiffs argued that failing to compensate employees for the mandatory checks violated the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), specifically referencing the requirement to remove things like belts and keys to pass through metal detectors and the amount of time that made the screenings last. They sought double damages, back pay, and overtime as compensation. The case decided on today was accepted by the Supreme Court for argument back in March after it had been allowed to move forward by the US Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit in April of 2013. That court's decision stated that ""the security clearances are necessary to employees’ primary work as warehouse employees,"" which is where the Supreme Court disagreed. The official opinion from the Supreme Court states that the ""primary work"" the FLSA is concerned with only involves the tasks that workers were employed to perform, and therefore anything else is non-compensable. That part of the decision is essentially the argument that Integrity originally made in its brief to the Supreme Court back in April, which claimed that these security checks are no different from other required tasks that happen off the clock: Attorneys for the plaintiffs told Bloomberg in October that if they had won the appeal, Amazon and staffing agencies like Integrity ""could be required to pay as many as 400,000 workers back wages amounting to $100 million or more.""",0.3350949699442729,0.6649050300557271,0.8675557292809035,324,5.216049382716049,190,6.0736842105263156,0,0,"Policy & Law, Tech, US & World",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

It's called Help! and it's only available on Android for now, but the bigger deal is that it's a live-action Spotlight Story. That's Google's format for 360-degree video, which lets you point your phone in any direction as a story unfolds in real time around you. The first Spotlight Story, Windy Day, won accolades for being innovative and the next one, Duet, was created with famed animator Glen Keane. But Lin's take on the format is much more ambitious and much more fun to watch than what came before. Help! is ambitious because it's a live-action video, which means that the characters and special effects have to play out in real time and without many of the tools that usually hang from a filmmaker's belt: edits, camera moves, cuts, and framing specific shots for the camera were all off the table. It also required that Google's skunkworks R&D division ATAP come up with an entirely new camera rig. At Google I/O last week, we sat down with Lin to ask him about the experience of crafting the story behind Help! and to see how a traditional director tackles the challenge of shooting in an entirely new format. Google is promising that there will be more Spotlight Stories to come and Lin himself might even be interested in making more of them — but not, unfortunately, based of his next directing effort, Star Trek 3. This interview has been edited for clarity and length. Dieter Bohn: How did you think about imposing the narrative in Help! — or were you not thinking about narrativity? Because, obviously, in a 360 degree video, you don't get to tell us where to look. Justin Lin:  Right. When I was in film school I had this great professor, Jerzy Antczak, a Polish filmmaker, and Joe Russo of the Russo Brothers were in my class. It was this kind of Easter European philosophy of motivating camera only through character and motions, and just exploring with lenses. That was the best year of my education in my life. And so when I first saw Windy Day, it just kind of blew me away. And I know that a lot of times when you see [360 degree video], people think that it’s like ""Choose Your Own Adventure."" So I felt like the best thing to do is to have a shared narrative. When I go on set every day I feel like my identity as a filmmaker grows with my work, but it's [about] where I choose to place a camera or not place a camera, the lenses I choose. And that's something that I felt like I could share with the viewer. At first I didn't know how to feel, but as we were doing it it felt very liberating. The best example I could give is when I was a kid and I saw La Femme Nikita. There was a scene, an assassination or something, and the camera just stayed on her and there as an explosion. You never saw it. I loved it. Of course, in the American remake, they showed the big explosion. It's not for me to judge which one is better, but I always felt like that's what a filmmaker is: you decide where you're going to put your edit. So do you translate the idea of a camera edit to trying to turn all those edits into the narrative? In many ways, we were learning as we were going. I think that the idea of actually imposing some sort of action element organically into this idea made it a bigger challenge. When I was going in, I had certain lenses that I wanted to use. Ideally I wanted to have a 40 millimeter and the widest I wanted to go was maybe 27, but I ended up having to go wider because of the storytelling, of the dance that needed [to replace traditional edits]. It’s not just a camera setting.  When the camera moves, it has to be motivated through character. It was also kind of breaking down character beats and using an element of dramaturgy. Was there a particular moment where you feel the camera movement was really based off of a character beat? I think when they get in the subway and they're not quite sure what is happening, and the camera is kind of floating towards the characters — it's trying to connect with them. And I try to do that for every beat. The subway moment for me was the most tense experience I have had watching anything on my phone and it was more tense than most experiences I’ve had in a theater. Because I want to watch them and see how they're reacting, but I hear the sound behind me and I want to turn around. That tension, of wanting to know which direction to point the camera, was that intentional? Yeah, very much. Because that's my job as a director, when I go in the cutting room. Deciding what coverage I want to use and what I choose to share or not share, that defines a movie. Again, I didn't know how to feel before we started. But doing it, even on the day we were doing it, that dance [made it clear]. You can prep. We did pre-viz. We built the sets. We built it in the computer and I was doing all the moves. But then once you get the actors in there you're now doing this dance, and trying to make that come to life. I mean, it's the scariest ... I've never [been on a shoot] where you show up in the morning, you're rehearsing, rehearsing, rehearsing because it's a one shot, and by about 10PM you're like, ""Holy crap, I don't think we have it."" And in that one moment where the camera moves, [you see the] character motivations, everything clicks and it comes to life. It was such a unique and special experience. I've never had that in filmmaking. Did it feel like theater more than filmmaking at that moment? Theater — and I probably can relate it most to maybe my experience on Community. You can't cheat comedy. You know, it either is going to be there on the day you capture or it's not. Do you think you ever want to do another Spotlight Story? Oh, yeah. I'll tell you what I was thinking about when I first saw Windy Day, two things kind of came to me. One was Help!, and another one was kind of an ensemble film — I kept [being reminded of] Robert Altman. Like ensemble drama and comedy. And I would love to explore that. And that there's a lot of different genres you can do. Kind of like the way you're explaining the subway sequence, I don’t think it's limited just to action. It could be action, it could be comedy, it could be horror. It's a shared narrative. I think at the end of the day that's the most exciting thing. Thinking about this as a new form. Do you think that that narrative is ever going to be more than a couple of minutes? I think it could go [longer.] There are a couple of limitations still. The lighting [is hard to figure out]. In film, when you're lighting the closeup, it's a different than when we do the wide shot. And here you can't. We're doing tricks just to be able to light [the scene]. And again I push the technology because, you know, the best thing to do is shoot it during the day. That's why [most people use] GoPros. But I said no, I want to shoot at night, which means we had to light it and they had to do some special filters into the RED camera. I think once we can shoot with a little bit longer lens and be able to light it, I think you could see feature-length potential. That's what I'm excited about.  I come from old school kind of filmmaking. I love Kubrick. I love films where even if you don't like the film, it doesn't matter. It's about respecting a point of view. And then coming [to 360 degree video], where you're sharing it and you're letting the viewers [choose their point of view]... You have a world, a narrative, and then the viewer has to decide on that specific viewing what point of view they want to take. Is it ever frustrating to you? Like, ""I really hope they're not looking over here during this scene."" Oh, no, no. I think with any kind of good, creative shared experience, it's hopefully done multiple times. Even when I was playing along with it I would do passes where I'm just looking at the sky. That's part of the fun of this new medium. It's kind of undefined, and we were learning on the fly as we were developing it, shooting it, and as we were going into post-production. Now I'm interested to see the reaction from the viewer. That's something that's so new and so unique that I don't know what other time in my life I'm ever going to have this experience again. Do you think that this is fundamentally harder? Both technically, and in crafting the narrative. What sort of stories do and don't work in this format? Do you think that we're anywhere near figuring out this medium? No. First of all, we went from seeing animation to trying to do live action, and trying to do live action with a [one-shot] with different levels and action. And I'm impressed and humbled by how many people that it took to just come in and figure it out. So I think the technical aspect is growing and evolving. I think anybody that sees this now, they're going to have an opinion, whether they like it or not. Those opinions are going to be important in the evolution of this medium. Personally, I want to keep pushing it, but I know that other people are going to have strong opinions [on which direction it should go.] And that's going to also help the evolution of this medium.",0.5417491320801936,0.4582508679198064,0.16320052091328704,1729,4.3186813186813184,668,5.7125748502994016,0,16,"Culture, Entertainment, Google, Tech, Interview",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

In addition to acquiring Killer Instinct developer Double Helix last year, Amazon has also hired notable developers like Kim Swift, designer of Portal, as well as Clint Hocking, who previously worked on franchises like Far Cry and Splinter Cell. Meanwhile, according to a report from Kotaku, Amazon has spent a lot of cash licensing the CryEngine, the same one used to make high-end PC games like Crysis 3. Outside of development, Amazon also acquired game streaming service Twitch last August for $970 million, and made gaming a big focus for its Fire TV media box. More recently, Amazon has partnered with a number of notable game studios to act as a pseudo-publisher for mobile games, with the aim of bringing back high-quality, non-free-to-play experiences to the platform. The most recent release, the horror game Til Morning's Light, is one of the more impressive mobile games in recent memory.

We've completely traded convenience for ecosystem lock-in, and it sucks. We've completely traded convenience for ecosystem lock-in, and it sucks Right now, the Echo can play music from Amazon's Prime Music service, Pandora, and whatever random music I've uploaded to my Amazon cloud locker. This means that the music selection is pretty bad! I stopped buying music around the time I started using Spotify, so I don't have much new stuff to upload, and Prime Music has a fairly thin catalog compared to Spotify. Basically this thing can play my 2000s-era iTunes collection at me, which means I'm listening Wilco and The Clash way more than I have in the past few years. Is that good? It might be good. But next week Apple is probably going to launch another streaming service, and if history is any guide, it's only going to work with Apple products. That means I'll have yet a fourth music service in my life (Spotify, Google Play Music, Prime, and Apple Music) and a fourth set of content exclusives and pricing windows to think about instead of just listening to music. In 2007, Steve Jobs wrote a fiery essay on Apple.com called ""Thoughts on Music."" The essay is now gone from Apple's site, but it remains as powerful as ever, a straightforward examination of the state of digital music and the pros and cons of applying digital rights management to purchased music files — there were no streaming services back then. The labels had forced Apple to use DRM in the early days of iTunes, and Jobs clearly recognized that although Apple and the iPod had emerged as the early winners in digital music, the effort required to maintain DRM over time (or license Apple's DRM to other companies) would be better spent making new products and services. ""If anything, the technical expertise and overhead required to create, operate and update a DRM system has limited the number of participants selling DRM protected music,"" wrote Jobs. ""If such requirements were removed, the music industry might experience an influx of new companies willing to invest in innovative new stores and players. This can only be seen as a positive by the music companies."" But it's no longer the labels pushing DRM on the music services; it's the services themselves, because locking you into a single ecosystem guarantees you'll keep paying their monthly subscription fees and hopefully buy into the rest of their ecosystem. Google Play Music is an objectively better experience on an Android phone than an iPhone, because it can download files in the background and purchase music not available for streaming. Apple Music might be available on Android, but it probably won't be as good, because Apple wants you to buy an iPhone. Playing Spotify through Bluetooth or AirPlay on iOS requires a trip through a totally superfluous screen promoting Spotify Connect. YouTube is the best way to find and share a single song on a desktop computer, but it remains a strange little island, disconnected from almost every other service. I used to love playing MP3s on my Xbox 360 while gaming, but there's no Spotify app on the Xbox One, so those days are over. There's not even a single standard playlist format to make switching services easier There's not even a single standard playlist format to make switching services easier, like the old .m3u playlist files my friends and I used to swap back and forth between iTunes and WinAmp and whatever else. There's just lock-in, endless lock-in. Is this what we wanted? Am I really despairing for the days when I maintained a huge collection of legal and not-so-legal MP3 files that could play on any device I owned without any hassle? I don't know.

Valve’s Steam Machines, gaming PCs designed to express the best of both worlds, are ostensibly the prototype for this awesome future, and they’re now available for preorder. Too bad they’re not something you should buy — yet.  Valve is a juggernaut in gaming thanks to Steam, the dominant online marketplace for PC games, and we’ve been excited to see the result of its hardware efforts since we first caught wind of its mythical PC console back in 2012. When we eventually sat down with CEO Gabe Newell, he outlined an exciting vision for the future: a gaming PC with all of Steam’s killer features that would be as convenient and comfortable to use on the couch as a console. The company got off to a fine start. Big Picture mode makes the PC more television-friendly with large text and easy-to-navigate menus. And its unique controller, coming in October, merges the traditional video game controller with the precision of a mouse. Those two things with a little polish might be enough — but Valve’s long-term vision is a PC gaming world without Windows, and that makes things complicated. Valve's long-term vision is a PC gaming world without Windows The official Steam Machines run SteamOS, which is basically Linux with Steam’s Big Picture Mode. Even though Valve is working to bring more games to Linux, most popular titles aren’t available for it yet, and there’s really no reliable way to predict which games will be supported in the future. Of the top 10 games you can buy on Steam right now, only one, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. There’s no Grand Theft Auto 5, or Skyrim, or DayZ. Hell, you can’t even play games that are compatible with Linux but aren’t on Steam, which includes Blizzard’s popular catalog. If you care about playing anything relatively new and popular, the Xbox One, PS4, Wii, and Windows-based PCs are all clearly superior options. And games aren’t the only compatibility problem. If Valve and HTC’s virtual reality headset is anything like the Oculus Rift, it’ll need powerful hardware, and it’s possible lower-end Steam Machines won’t support it. One of the reasons consoles are so compelling is that everything just works out of the box. You can buy hardware that’s as powerful as what everyone else has and expect that games will meet a minimum quality standard for years to come. The current spread of Steam Machine hardware is a confusing mess, and betrays the promise of console convenience. Even though Alienware and Syber are now offering flagship devices, the ""Steam Machine"" is really just a blueprint for a console-like gaming PC that encourages manufacturers to focus on things like form, size, and noise. That has resulted in way too many options, which actually contradicts the vision of simplicity Valve is working toward. Even the ""official"" offerings from Alienware and Syber range in price from $449 all the way up to $1,419 — at which point you have to ask, how is this different from shopping for a regular gaming PC? To add insult, Valve is offering Steam Machine preorders through the strangest of bedfellows: Gamestop. There’s no clear reason for anyone to buy into Valve’s platform right now. The audience that might be most sympathetic to the idea, devoted PC gamers, are far better off just buying or building a Windows-based machine so they can take advantage of everything Steam and PC gaming has to offer. And there’s a lot to offer! The idea of the Steam Machine is actually really compelling, provided it brings everything that’s great about PC gaming to the couch. PC gaming has long had a leg-up over consoles in important areas: the games are usually cheaper, there’s a lot more indie stuff to play, the graphics are better, you can upgrade the hardware over time, and there’s a whole world of game modification that unlocks and transforms popular titles in weird and surprising ways. Instead of offering the best of both worlds, Steam Machines sit in a strange middle ground that’s too confusing and too compromised to make sense for anyone. The Steam Machine is an exciting idea, but that’s all it is. Don’t pay for mere potential.

This year’s show features a “cozy zone,” a human-powered mobile zone, and an architectural structure called Gume. When you hear it from Jay Z, Tidal sounds pretty good. We spent time with the people behind his new streaming service to see how they're trying to win people over after a botched launch. If it works, Tidal could be way more than a streaming service. How many visitors does it take to make a niche web comic into a true success? Not all that many if the creators know how to work with the internet.

DARPA is putting $2 million on the line betting that someone can make it work. The BafflerJacob Silverman has some thoughts about the internet. “The Internet” is the universal straw man, a hero or villain for every occasion. The Internet, the Internet, the Internet—this decentralized communications network has long been granted a proper noun and practically a degree of sentience. Yet few people talk about “the Telephone” as if it were some person or place, though perhaps they once did. This eagerness to grant the Internet some degree of autonomy—to make it into an actor, an entity—stems in part from its apparent abstraction. Where does all this information come from? As Ray Bradbury famously said, “To hell with you and to hell with the Internet. It’s distracting. It’s meaningless; it’s not real. It’s in the air somewhere.”  Vanity FairPatrick Monahan tells the story of Frederic Lord Leighton’s Flaming June, a popular painting with a messy past. In 2014, Bamber Gascoigne, onetime host of British quiz showUniversity Challenge, unexpectedly inherited West Horsley Place, a crumbling country house, from his 99-year-old aunt, the Duchess of Roxburghe. Many rooms had been shuttered for decades, and Gascoigne spent months uncovering treasures, from Victorian footmen’s liveries to the Duchess’s miniver-trimmed coronation robes. Behind an anteroom door, he found a pencil-and-chalk drawing of a woman’s head: the central study for Flaming June, which had been lost for 120 years. Fast Company Annie Sneed explains why the art you like might be about more than just your personal tastes. The survey results revealed that people across the world generally liked—and disliked—many of the same things in artwork. All 10 countries preferred the color blue, which isn’t a surprise. Studies dating back to the 1940s have shown people presented with a palette of colors typically choose blue as their favorite. The prevalent theory to explain this: People subconsciously associate colors with things of the same color that they’ve seen in the past. So when someone sees the color blue, it reminds them of pleasant blue skies and clear water, and this influences their preference for it. Blue skies and clear water also have a universally positive association, which may explain why so many people across different cultures prefer blue. Vice Jason Leopold reports on newly released details about the Department of Defense's dealings with Edward Snowden. According to the documents, ""on any given day,"" between 200 and 250 people from DoD ""triage, analyze, and assess DoD impacts related to the Snowden compromise."" Summaries of the briefings the DIA held for Congress also reference a previously unknown entity: the Joint Staff Mitigation Oversight Task Force (MOTF), which was entrusted with, among other things, assessing the financial costs of ""mitigation efforts"" resulting from the Snowden leaks in quarterly reports. The NSA has its own Snowden task force that also assessed the alleged damage to national security his leaks about the agency's surveillance programs caused.  NPR Anastasia Tsioulcas details the difficulties that come with listening to classical music on a streaming service. And it's easy to see how things can head south, very fast, when it comes to classical music: We're talking about a genre that, in its broadest strokes, encompasses hundreds of years' worth of music, many thousands of composers and performers, very similar titles (ex: Franz Joseph Haydn's Symphony No. 103 versus his Symphony No. 104), multiple movements within most compositions and innumerable recordings, with each piece of music recorded by many different artists.

Microsoft previously revealed the new controller in a support article, saying that the newer version would be released after June. Meanwhile, a 1TB version of the console was previously released as part of a limited edition Call of Duty bundle. While that may seem like a lot of storage, with the rising prominence of downloadable games, 1TB might just be necessary for those who have made the shift to digital game libraries.

Apple originally accused Samsung of multiple patent infringements, claiming that it ripped off key features of Apple's iPhone, including its rounded corners, multi-touch gestures, and tap-to-zoom, but according to the ""friend of the court"" briefing, the Silicon Valley companies argued that the decision against Samsung would ""lead to absurd results and have a devastating impact on companies who spend billions of dollars annually on research and development for complex technologies and their components.""

Clearly inspired by Apple's design ethos, the phones boast excellent cameras, gorgeous screens, and are frankly more beautiful than any Samsung phone that came before them. But their biggest problems are still their very average battery life and the lack of expandable storage. Case-maker Incipio has come along this week with a new battery case it calls offGrid, and it promises to improve on those last pain points to bring the S6 closer to the ideal phones they could be. Improving on two great phones The offGrid is not terribly unlike other battery cases for Samsung phones in terms of aesthetic. While it makes your phone bulkier and a tad heavier, the trade-off is you get 100 percent extra battery life in return. (That should translate to more than a full day of use so long as you're not watching YouTube constantly.) However, Incipio boasts that the offGrid is the thinnest in its class, which is nice to know for those with skinnier jeans. It also has a pleasant matte finish, though it does pick up unsightly fingerprints.   Most important, though, is its storage option, which puts it in the same lane as mophie's Space Packs for the iPhone. The case has its own MicroSD slot, and supports up to 128Gb of additional storage, effectively doubling your phone storage at the highest end. Users can then pull their extra files on and off the device using Incipio's own File Browser app. It's a welcome addition for anyone who misses their music collection that isn't available on today's streaming services. The Incipio offGrid is available now for $89.99.

The outbreak has been a wake up call for health officials who are trying to keep it from spreading, as well as educate people on how to avoid getting infected. It's also prompted governments to green light new efforts to treat patients with experimental drugs, and reform future disaster response plans. You can follow along here for the latest. The Ebola epidemic in West Africa is far from over. Without a reliable drug or vaccine, new infections continue to surface in countries like Guinea and Sierra Leone. To fully squash the epidemic, some researchers want to overhaul current medical interventions in West Africa, as well as the way scientists conduct research in future outbreaks. The lessons researchers have learned in the last few months can be applied now, they say; they're the key to ending the current epidemic. A vaccine is ""highly effective"" against Ebola, according to the World Health Organization. Early results from a trial in Guinea show that the drug protected 100 percent of the people who received it against Ebola. If the trial's results continue to show this level of promise, the vaccine could help end the outbreak in West Africa. People infected with Ebola might one day find themselves treating the virus with drugs originally intended to tackle depression and heart disease. By screening more than 2,500 existing drugs, scientists have identified 30 FDA-approved drugs that appeared to kill the Ebola virus in cultured cells. Among then, the antidepressant Zoloft and heart disease drug Vascor were able to stop the virus from reproducing in rodents as well. The findings, published today in Science Translation Medicine, are... Chinese scientists report that the Ebola virus responsible for the outbreak in West Africa last year mutated at a normal rate, further alleviating fears that the virus had been able to evolve more rapidly than usual thanks to the prolonged and widespread nature of the epidemic. Ebola, like HIV and influenza, belongs to a class of virus with a high rate of mutation, and scientists had previously warned that it might evolve to become more contagious and, in an extreme scenario, even airborne. T... An experimental Ebola drug kept monkeys from dying when it was administered to them 72 hours after infection. The finding bodes well for a human drug trial that’s already underway in Sierra Leone — a country were nine cases of Ebola were reported just last week. Another Ebola vaccine is making its way through human trials with promising results. The vaccine was well tolerated by healthy volunteers in an early safety trial, according to a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine today.   ""this vaccine could be further tested in large phase III studies in West Africa"" Since the beginning of the current outbreak, Ebola has infected over 25,000 people and claimed the lives of 10,000 people, most of whom reside in West Africa. Ebola isn't... Ebola itself was bad enough in Sierra Leone, Guinea, and Liberia. But the outbreak also led to turmoil in those countries' health care systems — and now a measles outbreak is a risk. Should a measles outbreak occur, almost twice as many people will be sickened, compared with before the outbreak. Thousands could die, according to a study appearing in the journal Science today. ""Measles in particular is known to show up during or after humanitarian crises because it’s so infectious,"" says... We’re finally starting to understand how Ebola infects living organisms, which means we’re getting closer to finding a way to stop it. The virus enters and infects cells thanks to channels in the cell’s membrane, according to a study published in Science today — and a molecule found in an Asian herb appears to be able to stop that process in mice. The World Health Organization has approved the first rapid test for detecting Ebola, providing health workers with a way to quickly identify patients who have been infected with the virus, reports The Guardian. The test returns results in 15 minutes and is planned for use in West Africa, where the Ebola epidemic continues even as new infections begin to taper. That quick turnaround is a dramatic change from current testing, which reportedly requires around four to six hours in a lab, but is... The international response to the Ebola crisis was more generous than most health policy experts predicted, but the actual deployment of those resources has been extremely slow, according to an analysis of Ebola donations published today in the British Medical Journal.

An Ebola vaccine produced using a chimpanzee common cold virus appears to be safe to use on humans, according to a study published today in the New England Journal of Medicine. Three different doses of vaccine were tested on healthy humans in the UK, and it was well-tolerated; it triggered high levels of antibody formation without also triggering serious side effects. But until the vaccine is tested in an area where an Ebola risk actually exists, it’s efficacy against the disease will remain... As many as 12 scientists may have been exposed to Ebola earlier this week in a US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lab in Atlanta, The Washington Post reports. On Monday, scientists who were researching the disease accidentally put a sample containing the Ebola virus in a place where it was transferred to another lab on the CDC's Atlanta campus.  Though the world has made progress in ending the Ebola epidemic, reports from Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone suggest the fight against Ebola isn't over, according to correspondence from the World Health Organization published online today by The New England Journal of Medicine. Fewer people are being infected, but successes against the disease have been unevenly distributed, and the outbreak isn't under control. Merck & Co. and NewLink Genetics stopped their early-stage Ebola vaccine trial after only a week, after four of 59 volunteers said they had pains in their hands and feet, according to a report from The Financial Times.

The trial may restart in January, if the joint pains patients experienced are ""benign and temporary,"" The Financial Times said. Merck bought the vaccine last month for as...

And ""right around the new year, we will have the new data.""

The US is going to begin monitoring all travelers who enter the country from Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea for three weeks after landing to detect symptoms of Ebola. Time reports that the program will begin on Monday in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Maryland, and Georgia, which is where most travelers coming from these countries end their trips. As was previously announced, travelers will also be required to go through one of just five airports that will pass them through... Starting Wednesday, travelers who have spent time in Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea will have to land in one of five airports if they want to gain access to the US, reports USA Today. The Department of Homeland Security announced today that all travelers coming from Ebola-stricken countries will have to go through enhanced screening — screening that currently only takes place in New York City, Chicago, Newark, Washington, and Atlanta. The Obama administration will name Ron Klain as ""Ebola Czar,"" reports CNN. Klain, a former White House official and general counsel of Revolution, an investment group, will be responsible for coordinating the government's response to Ebola within the US. ""It may be appropriate for me to appoint an additional person."" Until now, CDC director Tom Frieden had largely been responsible for overseeing Ebola interventions in the US.

He was spotted escorting Amber Vinson, the second nurse to become infected with Ebola in the US, to a plane that would take her to Emory University Hospital in Atlanta. As many noted on Twitter, he wasn't wearing protective gear. Instead, he was holding a clipboard. The second nurse to be diagnosed with Ebola in the US warned health officials of her high fever before boarding a flight from Cleveland to Dallas, according to a report today from Bloomberg. Officials say the chance of transmission is low, though they are nevertheless contacting at least 132 people who flew on the same Frontier Airlines flight, as well as three people she saw during her stay in Cleveland.

Officials in Texas today announced that a second health care worker who treated the first person diagnosed with Ebola in the US has tested positive for the deadly disease.

At the time of the announcement, the nurse — now identified as 26-year-old Nina Pham — had already been placed in isolation and was being treated for Ebola in Dallas, Texas. But in a conference call today, Tom Frieden, the CDC’s director, admitted that the CDC still doesn’t know how Pham contracted the... A healthcare worker in Texas has been diagnosed with Ebola, the first known transmission of the deadly virus in the US.

The decision comes in response to growing fears in the US public that Ebola could easily spread into the country via international air... In the immediate aftermath of the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, several drug companies quickly ramped up work on developing a vaccine for the deadly virus. Now, one of those vaccines is undergoing trials in Mali and, if testing goes as planned, it will be deployed in the hardest-hit West African nations in an effort to protect healthcare workers. Mali has no known Ebola cases, though shares a border with Guinea, the nation in which the outbreak began. According to The Guardian, three... Thomas Duncan, the first person to be diagnosed with Ebola in the US, has died, reports The New York Times. Duncan was diagnosed with Ebola on 30 September and died just before 8AM this morning at the Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas. The first time a reporter asked a CDC representative whether Thomas Duncan — the first patient to receive an Ebola diagnosis in the US — was an American citizen, the question seemed pretty tame. One could excuse it as a general inquiry about the Duncan’s nationality during the first press conference announcing his diagnosis. But after the CDC declined to answer, the question kept coming. ""Is he a citizen?"" reporters repeatedly asked. ""Is he one of us?"" they meant. The number of troops sent to the West African countries crippled by the Ebola epidemic may rise as high as 4,000, according to the New York Times. The announcement comes as the US has faced criticism for its response to Ebola at home and abroad. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have just confirmed that the first-ever case of Ebola has been diagnosed in the US. The patient had recently traveled to Liberia and is now in isolation in Texas. A fast, decisive response by the medical community could end the Ebola epidemic in January, says Tom Frieden, the director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That's the best-case scenario. The worst-case scenario is 1.5 million people infected in Sierra Leone and Liberia by January. Guinea wasn't included in the estimate because the cases there have varied in ways that can't be reliably modeled. To end the epidemic in January, about 70 percent of people who are infected... The World Health Organization says a total of more than 20,000 people may be infected with ebola in West Africa before the virus is contained. The United Nations agency released a new roadmap for dealing with the outbreak today, designed to respond to the ""urgent need to dramatically scale up the international response"" to the rapid proliferation of the disease. The document says the ebola virus is spreading much faster than the WHO had anticipated, and would cost at least $490 million to... Officials from the World Health Organization today said that experimental medications, like the one currently being used to treat some patients in the West Africa outbreak of the deadly ebola virus, are ethically sound. A panel of 12 doctors, professors, and health advocates discussed the matter yesterday, and decided that using experimental treatments or vaccines could be beneficial. That's as long as potential patients know what they're getting into, and that any data resulting from the... An experimental drug designed to treat patients infected with the deadly ebola virus could be back on track for human testing following a decision from the US Food and Drug Administration today.

Rather than paper, researchers are starting to apply origami's principles to robotics: instead of putting a robot together piece by piece through some complicated assembly process, researchers at Harvard and MIT have been building a robot that, like origami, just needs to be folded together from a single sheet — and can do all of the folding on its own. Their robot begins as a flat sheet with some embedded electronics in it, and once activated, it takes about four minutes for to self-fold into a weird kind of crab-shape and start crawling away. The researchers are describing the robot today in a paper published in Science.  Different fold variations could easily alter a future robot The robot's assembly process works through heat. Once the battery is connected on the unassembled sheet, it'll start to heat joints that have been built into it, waiting until they've all been bent at the proper angles before activating its walking mechanism. That's all pretty simple, but the researchers argue that it's easy to see where this can go. Instead of needing a human to active the robot by connecting its battery, the robot could activate when it's sent a signal wirelessly or it could sit and wait for an environmental cue, such as when it detects a certain temperature or pressure. Paired with the robot's small size, that could eventually make it a very useful tool. Because the unassembled robot is largely just a flat sheet, the researchers suggest that it could easily be transported and stored. One idea is that a more advanced version of the robot could be used for search-and-rescue missions. ""[They could be delivered] through a confined passageway, such as a collapsed building, after which they would assemble into their final form autonomously,"" Marc Lavine, a Science senior editor, says in a statement. That potential for easy deployability also makes robots like this a potential option for use in space exploration or other hazardous environments. Or, your next Ikea purchase could just assemble itself.  (Seth Kroll / Wyss Institute) Beyond that, that the robots are effectively created by folding could have some interesting implications for manufacturing: like in origami, a slightly different fold could result in a major change to the final structure. That means that manufacturers might be able to make changes to a robot design quite easily, without having to dramatically retool an assembly line. The researchers also imagine that an algorithm could eventually be capable of figuring out exactly what folds are needed to attain what changes in shape, streamlining the whole process. Origami could be the new 3D printing The researchers compare their use of origami to 3D printing — an increasingly easy way to turn 2D materials into 3D shapes. Likewise, there are still great issues here with what sizes the origami robots can work in, and likewise, it's possible that figuring out how to work with different materials could resolve some of those issues and expand the possibilities of what these creations can do. Other researchers have been looking into this type of origami structure for robots already, but today's is said to be the first result that can operate without any human intervention (aside from kicking off the assembly process, of course). As such, the researchers don't necessarily see these robots as something that'll have a presence in your home any time soon, but eventually, they imagine that you might see plenty around the neighborhood.",0.5890964572081946,0.4109035427918054,0.15279523094713418,598,5.0769230769230766,319,6.1724137931034484,1,2,Science,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

According to the World Health Organization, ebola has now infected 1,711 and led to 932 deaths across Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone.

While Horvath says management was aware of the alleged issues, many of her colleagues were shocked. Horvath had tried to keep things discreet; she lined up a new job and planned to quit quietly.

The implication being, if you are in the software world, you already know GitHub is indispensable. GitHub was even praised recently by ReadWrite for being ""a great place for women to work."" That was because of Horvath, who advocates for women coders by speaking at conferences, and working with groups like Women Who Code, Girls Who Code, and Girl Develop It. GitHub was even praised for being ""a great place for women to work."" When she joined GitHub in March of 2012, Horvath was the only woman on her team. By late 2012, even with GitHub growing fast, there were still only three women on the tech side. The dearth of women inspired Horvath to start Passion Projects, an all-female talk series hosted at GitHub’s office. Horvath got the project approved by ambushing co-founder and then-CEO Tom Preston-Werner at a company meeting. Preston-Werner had just given a speech about the importance of hiring women coders, and Horvath seized the moment to jump up and pitch her idea. ""I kind of put him on the spot, and I hope he’s forgiven me,"" she told ReadWrite. Passion Projects became a feather in GitHub’s cap — Preston-Werner was soon bragging about it to the press — and the number of techie women at GitHub had increased to 11 by January of 2014. Suddenly, it was seen as a paragon of gender equality at a tech-centric company — or at least, a shining example of ""diverse for the field."" In one day, all of the work I've done at that company to be a better place for women to work has come undone.  Horvath now admits that part of her motivation was discrimination she felt at GitHub. She never named Preston-Werner, the co-founder who has reportedly been put on leave for her harassment, but it seems she was referring to him in previous interviews about sexism. ""I got to a point where I was so frustrated with the leadership in this industry,"" she said in an interview late last year. ""Because I would hear ‘We should hire more women!’ on almost a daily basis from the same people who kind of refused to respect me as a peer. So in a lot of ways Passion Projects was an attempt to call all of their bluffs. I was finally asking my founders and this industry to put their money and their support where their mouths are."" GitHub now has 238 employees across all positions, and roughly 20 percent are women. But after she quit, Horvath even seemed to renounce the work she had done through Passion Projects. ""I regret defending GitHub's culture to feminists for the last two years,"" she said on Twitter. ""I'm sorry to everyone I've hurt in doing so."" GitHub is conducting an internal investigation to determine exactly what happened. But Horvath’s side of the story, as related in an exclusive interview with TechCrunch, is this: GitHub was generally female-friendly, but her team felt like a boy’s club. She felt increasingly aware of ""how little the men I worked with respected and valued my opinion"" and observed the same thing happening to her female co-workers. This final indignity pushed Horvath over the edge The situation allegedly became extreme when a founder — reported to be Preston-Werner — asked his wife — reported to be Theresa Preson-Werner — to make sure Horvath was happy. She took Horvath out to drinks and badgered her, apparently worried that Horvath would quit and badmouth GitHub and her husband. She began working in the GitHub office and attempting to intimidate Horvath in person. Meanwhile, her husband reprimanded Horvath for dating a co-worker and tried unsuccessfully to get her boyfriend to quit. At the same time, another co-worker started removing Horvath’s code from projects after she turned him down for a date. I've been harassed by 'leadership' at GitHub for two years. And I am the first developer to quit.  This was roughly when Horvath started Passion Projects, but she says her own situation just got worse. Human resources and another co-founder — likely Wanstrath, who swapped roles with Preston-Werner and became CEO in January — tried to help, but the harassment continued. One day, one of Horvath’s female co-workers and a friend were hula-hooping in the office. She noticed male co-workers leering, and chastised them. The male co-workers ""didn’t see a problem with it."" This final indignity pushed Horvath over the edge. Horvath has long been outspoken, the kind of woman often called ""pushy"" for asserting herself at work and calling out what she perceived as sexism. ""I've tried my best to point things out that are fundamentally wrong within organizations I'm a part of, and have often been dismissed or given the ultimatum of keeping quiet or losing my job,"" she wrote on her personal blog. ""I've digested those experiences, have tried my best to move past them,"" Horvath wrote, ""and instead of continuing to lend power to people who thrive on conflict, have decided to focus my energy toward making my own company and this industry a better place for women to be. It makes me really sad to think that I could be martyred for this."" Sexism is sometimes subtle. Were the hula-hoop spectators being disrespectful, or merely watching something unusual and fun in the office? Were Preston-Werner and his wife trying to silence Horvath for alleging gender issues in the office, or were they trying to protect what they believed to be a positive environment threatened by an agitator? ""It makes me really sad to think that I could be martyred for this."" Some GitHubbers believed Horvath was a negative influence in a company that is a force for good in the world, which is why such virulence poured out anonymously when she quit. Others looked around and saw a company with a supportive, family-like culture where women don’t feel like a minority, and wondered what the heck Horvath was talking about. The reason some GitHubbers never sensed discrimination may be, in part, because of Horvath’s efforts to stamp it out. One female employee recounted how a group of male engineers changed a variable name from ""king"" to ""monarch"" on their own initiative, to eliminate gendered language that might make female peers feel left out . The female employees who spoke to The Verge were extremely supportive of Horvath. While they say they haven’t experienced discrimination, they were careful not to say anything that could be construed as casting doubt on her story. ""I'm focused on making sure that as a woman, I do a better job of being available and supportive and accessible,"" one female employee tells The Verge. ""I want to be someone to talk to. I want to do whatever I can. And we all failed to do that for Julie."" The negative publicity certainly hasn’t helped its image, but the company’s rapid response should help GitHub emerge relatively unscathed. Not to mention the fact that many women working in tech have seen much worse. One female designer who knew Horvath through the tech scene tells The Verge that the episode doesn’t make GitHub less appealing as a potential employer. ""I'm pretty used to startup culture and often feel like I can go into most companies and thrive (and then bring along other girls with me)."" Female GitHubbers said the same thing. ""I don’t think that this will affect women wanting to work for GitHub,"" the female GitHub developer says. ""I have a female friend right now who wants to work for GitHub and this has not changed that."" ""I'm a big fan of GitHub and I am personally devastated by this."" Whether Horvath’s allegations hold up, they’re yet another reminder of the gender imbalance in the industry. Jake Bilbrey, a front end developer in San Francisco, says he’s seen sexism and bullying similar to what Horvath describes. ""I'm a big fan of GitHub and I am personally devastated by this,"" he says. ""I don't think it's feasible that I can stop using GitHub, it's such an important tool, but I will try to minimize my dependence on it. I'm hoping they handle this maturely and effectively so I don't have to.""",0.4957751542223091,0.5042248457776909,0.8321492547153518,1711,4.901811805961426,767,6.2555410691003912,0,0,"Business, Tech, Report",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

The company’s CEO, Elon Musk, responded with a fiery blog post accusing state legislators of cutting a backroom deal with traditional franchised auto retailers — retailers with which Tesla has consistently refused to do business — and playing by ""mafia"" rules. It was tough talk from a brilliant and powerful billionaire, but the Garden State’s car salesmen aren’t taking the criticism lying down. ""He needs to stop and take a breath."" ""He needs to stop and take a breath,"" said Jim Appleton, the president of the New Jersey Coalition of Automobile Retails, or NJ CAR. ""If you’re an internet billionaire, maybe you think the world revolves around you, and the world springs from your laptop. Well, I got news for him. This is not a new law, Tesla is operating illegally, and as of April 1st, they will be out of business unless they decide to open a franchise."" Appleton is right that New Jersey had a law on the books banning direct sales from manufacturers, but that was a relic of a bygone era before dealerships were a firmly cemented incumbent. The state’s motor vehicle commission had issued two licenses to Tesla to operate its own stores in New Jersey. Given the recent rule change, however, those licenses will not be renewed when they expire on April 1st. This may set a painful precedent for Tesla: state legislators in New York and Ohio are also considering an updated ban on direct sales, and byzantine rules in Texas prevent the company’s corporate-owned dealerships from even discussing pricing with potential customers. Tesla recently escaped a similar fate in North Carolina by offering state legislators free rides around the capitol. New York and Ohio are also considering a updated ban  Tesla has steadfastly refused to work with franchised dealers and has promised it will continue to sell direct. Musk says this is necessary to survive, arguing that dealers will always prefer to sell gas-powered cars over electric, which he claims require fewer repairs and thus drive less recurring revenue to the dealership. He points to the failures of Fisker and Coda, two American electric-car companies that worked with dealers, as evidence. ""This Musk guy, he wants all the profits for himself."" This conflict basically boils down to money and who gets a piece of each auto sale and the subsequent repairs. Without a franchised dealer, Tesla is avoiding the middleman. ""This Musk guy, he wants all the profits for himself,"" says Tom Dougherty, a 25-year veteran of the business who now works in sales at a luxury vehicle dealership in upscale Princeton, New Jersey. ""They wanted to go direct, which means no sales force. That’s cutting out a lot of people. No way that’s gonna fly."" While Tesla represents only a small portion of auto sales in New Jersey, the state was a major market for the high-end electric car company. It represented the fourth largest market for luxury automobiles — like Tesla's Model S, which can tip the scales past $100,000 — trailing only New York, Florida, and California. ""His legal opinions are about as sound as my programming abilities."" In his response to the New Jersey ban, Musk recommended customers head across the Hudson River to visit the Tesla showroom in lower Manhattan. But unless Tesla can find a way to match the influence auto dealers currently have with state legislators, the situation in New Jersey could be a harbinger for the company’s business prospects in many other parts of the country. ""Mr. Musk is a brilliant man, and Tesla is an innovative company. We can all respect that,"" says NJ CAR’s Appleton. ""But he doesn’t get what it takes to do business in New Jersey. With all due respect, his legal opinions are about as sound as my programming abilities.""",0.5277190372377469,0.47228096276225306,0.8377054618412846,678,4.9631268436578173,381,5.9580052493438318,0,0,"Business, Policy & Law, US & World, Report",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

The company had announced it was working to support multiple accounts in November. Dropbox also plans to roll out new tools for administrators at the event, according to the email. The features will go live April 9th. Dropbox, which is said to be moving steadily toward an initial public offering, has been placing an increasing emphasis on building features for business customers. Businesses, who have increasingly embraced cloud storage and collaboration tools, tend to be more profitable than the consumers Dropbox has courted up to now. Its rival Box, which also began life as an online storage company for consumers, switched its focus to building for businesses in 2007 after early customers clamored for tools that would let them use the service for work — and offered to pay a premium for those tools. Box has reportedly filed for an IPO. The new features go live on April 9th Meanwhile, the price of online storage is falling steadily toward zero. This week, Google slashed the price of storage on Google Drive, dropping the price for storing 1 terabyte of data from $49.99 a month to $9.99 a month. Dropbox consumer storage tops out at 500 gigabytes for $49.99 a month. Company founder Drew Houston has said in the past that users care more about having a service that works than how many gigabytes they are using, but that could change as Dropbox’s rivals continue offering more space for less money. Building specialized tools for businesses offers Dropbox a new revenue stream in the short term, and a hedge against the potential decline of its consumer business over the long term. More than 200 million people use Dropbox’s online storage and file synchronization service, and so far it has signed up more than 4 million businesses, the company says.

""It was exciting, and odd, and a little scary,"" he recalls. Two years and millions of songs later, Chasen announces that he is shutting the company down for good, ending one of the most compelling experiments in music discovery to ever hit the web. A big part of what doomed Turntable was trying to play by the rules, says Chasen. ""We wanted to do it all the right way, nothing shady, always working with the labels."" That meant paying every time a song was streamed, not simply piggybacking on copyrighted music hosted by sites like YouTube or SoundCloud that might have been uploaded illegally. The company also cut off access to its international users in areas it hadn’t yet signed deals. ""That really curtailed our growth."" It transitioned from a DJ service to a live-performance experience back in December of 2013, and today is shutting down that service as well.  ""We wanted to do it all the right way, nothing shady."" The idea that the music industry’s current system of licensing and royalty fees is crippling American startups has been gaining traction for a while. David Pakman, a venture capital investor with Venrock and former digital music entrepreneur, published a long essay this week pointing out that the music labels are essentially demanding about twice as much in royalty payments as consumers are currently willing to pay for the privilege of listening. Companies like Rdio and Rhapsody have struggled, Spotify has raised millions but still can’t turn a profit, and Pandora announced today it was going to have to raise prices for all its subscription customers. Music labels are essentially demanding about twice as much in royalty payments as consumers are currently willing to pay Chasen says he still thinks that plenty of great stuff could happen in the digital music industry. ""We had users that were willing to pay for virtual goods like custom avatars and merchandise. That’s a brand new revenue stream the major labels haven’t really tapped before."" But until things change dramatically, he isn’t planning another music venture. ""I just don’t think real innovation is possible with the current system."" For his next venture, Chasen is keeping things small to start. About a month ago he launched a new app, Ketchup, which is intended to help users keep their close friends and family updated on their daily lives without overwhelming their wider social network. ""My girlfriend wants to know when I’m home, or at the office, or at the coffee shop, but blasting that out to my whole Twitter following would annoy people,"" says Chasen.

Chasen built the app with two other developers from Turntable and for now they’re keeping the project small and self-funded. ""This solves a pain point I have in my life,"" says Chasen.

While supporters of net neutrality argue that it is key to the continued growth of the internet, Merkel believes just the opposite. She argues that fast lanes are necessary for the development of new, advanced uses of the internet, like telemedicine or driverless cars. According to Merkel, without guaranteed, fast-access internet connections, such innovations won't come to market. Can you have a fast lane and maintain net neutrality? It's not clear how such a two-lane system would be implemented or regulated. For instance, it's unknown if there would be limits on what sort of companies could pay for access to fast-lane internet. A report from Frankfurter Allgemeine cites sources inside the German government who say that on-demand internet video streaming services would be among the companies that would be able to pay for access for high-speed service. The European Union currently mandates true net neutrality, though discussions have been underway for the future of internet regulation. Merkel believes that her position is a middle ground, but the idea that the general traffic lane will operate under net neutrality depends entirely on how much bandwidth it receives from internet providers.

A new analysis of social media usage by the Obama and Romney camps during the 2012 race reveals that every @MittRomney tweet had to be approved by 22 different people. No one individual had the freedom to improvise a timely tweet while on the trail. ""Romney’s digital team had to go through an extensive vetting process for all of its public communications, meaning that the temporal workflow of the campaign did not match the speed of social media,"" reads the paper, Seizing the Moment, by Daniel Kreiss, an assistant professor at UNC Chapel Hill. As Romney's digital director put it, the candidate published ""the best tweets ever written by 17 people."" By contrast, Barack Obama's digital team wasn't handcuffed in the same manner and could strike with little delay. There was the response to Clint Eastwood's bizarre RNC speech below, and in another sign of the looser Obama operation, the president's team even tweeted out a Spotify playlist.

Amid the anger and sadness, one thing is clear: policing in America is a huge and complex problem. It's also a historical problem. As Ta-Nehisi Coates observed in The Atlantic, the insane incarceration rate of blacks in this country is part of a long tradition; ""America's entire history is marked by the state imposing unfreedom on a large swath of the African American population."" That tradition is as deep and as old as our revered constitution. The condition of possibility of America's existence was a racist compromise baked into our founding document. We're a country founded by people who declared forcefully that ""all men are created equal"" as a self-evident fact, and then 12 years later declared that black slaves were only worth three-fifths of free white men to avoid giving the South greater representation in Congress. The chokehold on people of color in America is written in ink. And it has always been about property. So, perhaps ironically, I find myself sympathetic to the words of a southern white man, Senator Rand Paul. Listen to what he said when he was asked this week about Eric Garner's death on MSNBC.  Senator Paul's libertarian-leaning politics are controversial, but they're also predictable — it's not a surprise that he took an opportunity to knock excessive New York taxation. (A city that tried to ban large sodas is low-hanging fruit for conservatives who love to rail against the nanny state.) Paul's argument is that high taxes on cigarettes in New York incubated an underground market that ultimately created the conditions for Eric Garner's death. Here's what Paul said about taxation: Well you know I think it’s hard not to watch that video of him saying ‘I can’t breathe, I can’t breathe’ and not be horrified by it. But I think there’s something bigger than the individual circumstances. Obviously, the individual circumstances are important, but I think it is also important to know that some politician put a tax of $5.85 on a pack of cigarettes, so that [drove] cigarettes underground by making them so expensive. Plenty of people blasted Paul for what appeared to be a crass hijacking of Garner's death for an anti-taxation rant. Wonkette wrote a sarcastic retort. CNN's Jeffrey Toobin said ""Rand Paul is the only person who is blaming it on cigarette taxes... which I think is really a misreading of what happened here."" Jon Stewart had similar things to say. These reactions are heartfelt, but they're also uncharitable. It's fair to say Paul is not the most important voice on the subject, though he is a rumored frontrunner for the GOP presidential race in 2016. It's also fair to say his ideas about race are often tone deaf — his positions on civil rights are arcane and academic. I can't really say what Paul's motives are, but his point is at least worth considering: police officers, like the one who killed Eric Garner, don't exist in a vacuum. They're enabled by laws. Paul's point is that police officers don't exist in a vacuum without any legal context For more than a decade, the United States has had the highest incarceration rate in the world. Countries comparable to the US typically jail about 100 prisoners for every 100,000 people. The United States jails about five times that many people. Think about that for a moment; it's not possible to explain away simply by invoking the patriotic parable that America is exceptionally blessed by the rule of law. Other nations — ones we routinely demonize for being draconian and regressive — don't put nearly as many people in jail as the US. There are two possibilities here: either more Americans are natural born criminals than everyone else in the world, or we're making criminals out of lots of harmless people. There are myriad laws across the US, both state and federal, that put nonviolent people in prison for relatively trivial crimes. The consequences are disastrous for the individuals put behind bars, for their loved ones, and for the rest of society that must bear the cost of what is essentially a lost life. Some of these sentences are unimaginable. The ACLU has reported that more than 3,000 people will spend the rest of their life in jail with no possibility of parole because they did something like steal a jacket or facilitate the sale of $10 of marijuana. The war on drugs is a specter of totalitarianism But if there's one dominant specter of totalitarianism in the United States, it's the war on drugs. For more than 40 years, prohibition in America has been the sharpest arrow in the tyrant's quiver; it has given the state the broad authority and justification to make demons of our neighbors, especially people of color. It has also drastically militarized local police forces, leading to countless SWAT raids and the harrowing show of force the world witnessed in Ferguson, where cops wearing camouflage pointed sniper rifles and launched tear gas at peaceful assemblies of mourning residents. The war on drugs is one of the reasons blacks make up just 13 percent of the population but roughly half of all prison inmates. Over time, the racial disparity in enforcement of drug laws has reinforced popular notions of black criminality and given racists recursive and circular justification for perpetuating those laws: The law is the law. You broke the law and you deserve to pay for it. You made a choice. Meanwhile, whites consume drugs at equal or higher rates than others, but aren't nearly punished for it as much.   According to the ACLU, from 2002-2011 the NYPD alone made more than 350,000 arrests for low-level marijuana offenses. 86 percent of those people were black or Latino. It's not because black and brown people consume more drugs than whites; it's because white cops target black and brown people by instinct or by statute. Liberals should be particularly sympathetic to Paul's logic about the government enabling illicit markets because it's symmetrical with arguments made against the spectacular failure of the war on drugs. For decades, opponents have pointed out that prohibition has not only failed to decrease the consumption and distribution of drugs in the United States, it has increased the amount of violence associated with the sale and use of drugs — the same way alcohol prohibition in the 20th century empowered murderous gangsters like Al Capone without actually stopping anybody from drinking. And it's not just violence amongst criminals; the war on drugs has drastically increased our interactions with police, justifying ""broken windows"" policies like New York's shuttered stop and frisk program, which chiefly targeted — you guessed it — young black men. For white officers who literally view black men as demons, many of these kinds of encounters end in bloodshed. Eric Garner wasn't selling drugs when he was killed, but he was already a victim of the nation's drug laws. He'd been busted for pot possession and sale of loose cigarettes in the past: charges that led some people to call him a ""career criminal,"" even in reader comments left on this website. ""Petty or not, this man has a long history of breaking the law,"" one conservative blogger wrote. Officer Pantaleo ""operated under the scope of his authority,"" Rep. Matt Salmon (R-AZ) said. ""He resisted arrest, that is why he is dead,"" former NYPD detective Harry Houck said. These people want to blame Eric Garner for his death by painting him as a professional criminal — all because he broke petty laws that were enforced by racially biased policing. Garner was approached by police and put in a chokehold merely on the suspicion that he was selling loose cigarettes again. Excessive taxation is a form of prohibition Cigarettes aren't in the same class as harder drugs under the law, but they still fall under the umbrella of the war on drugs in a practical sense; it's illegal to resell them because the state desires a monopoly on the sale of things like tobacco and alcohol. (To give you an idea how serious the government is about controlling these substances, there's an entire federal law enforcement agency just devoted to alcohol, tobacco, and firearms.) This is where Paul's point about taxation is relevant. Excessive taxation is a form of prohibition, especially for the poor, who are disproportionately affected by aggressive policing. As Isaiah Berlin wrote in the famous essay Two Concepts on Liberty: ""it is argued, very plausibly, that if a man is too poor to afford something on which there is no legal ban... he is as little free to have it as he would be if it were forbidden him by law."" Sin taxes are also regressive: they hurt the poor disproportionately. And it's not like cigarette addicts have much of a choice. But taxation wasn't even the crux of Paul's argument. He also spoke to a more fundamental problem: But then some politician also had to direct the police to say, ‘hey we want you arresting people for selling a loose cigarette.’ And for someone to die over breaking that law, there really is no excuse for it. But I do blame the politicians. We put our police in a difficult situation with bad laws. Paul is simply saying what most empathetic people who watched the video of Eric Garner's killing are saying: how can we let our police kill someone for selling loose cigarettes? Why should police even be involved in this kind of business in the first place? Who benefits from this kind of policing? Why does the state really need to put people who sell loose cigarettes at the end of a gun, or a chokehold?   I can't tell you how we get to a more just society. I can't tell you how we can reform so many bad laws in so little time to prevent the killing of another Michael Brown, or Oscar Grant, or Eric Garner, or Tamir Rice. As many critics have noted, we'll no sooner eliminate racist policing in America with a few more training seminars than we will with body cameras. Police won't cede their power voluntarily; they must be leashed by the law. An essential reagent for deliberative democracy is truth, and the truth is this: the implied premise of politicians directing the police is that we elect the politicians. In that sense, the blame for police brutality cannot, and never will, reside solely with the police. We — white Americans — are to blame. We are the majority. And the only way we can prevent the police from treating our black neighbors like demons is to stop giving them the license to.",0.44989175709913043,0.5501082429008696,0.8334169868908189,1823,4.8732857926494786,836,6.4294258373205739,0,4,"Policy & Law, US & World, Editorial",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

Street harassment, sexism, and rape on campus came to the forefront of our shared conversation through social media, protests, and all forms of journalism. And it worked. People who otherwise would never have talked about rape culture engaged in the conversation. I've never heard so many men use the word ""consent."" It doesn't matter that the discussions were polarizing, or that many continue to debate rape culture's existence. The discussion happened, and it's largely because women used the power of the internet to make it so. Rolling Stone's ""note"" blames the victim, not the reporting That's why today's admission by Rolling Stone that a spine-chilling account of a rape at the University of Virginia may not have been entirely factual is so upsetting. Instead of owning up to an incredible number of unforgivable reporting mistakes, a magazine that I once respected professionally decided to blame the victim. Worse, Rolling Stone did it by explaining that their reporters and editors skipped some crucial reporting steps to try to prevent victim-blaming from happening in the first place: Rolling Stone's original story of Jackie's rape at the University of Virginia was terrifying. According to the article, she was gang-raped at a frat party after her date took her up to a room full of fraternity members. But according to The Washington Post's investigation of Jackie's story, both the article's author Sabrina Rubin Erdely and Rolling Stone's fact-checkers failed to verify if a party had taken place on the day she said the rape happened. Moreover, Jackie said that her date was a member of the fraternity throwing the party — a fact that The Washington Post says is false.  (The Washington Post's own story originally contained a large error as well: it said that Jackie had never met the man in question. But that claim only came from the man himself, and it was later removed from the Post's article since it can't be verified.) Rolling Stone failed to check both these facts. The problem isn't Jackie — it's Rolling Stone Finally, as Vox's Sarah Kliff points out, Jackie told The Washington Post that Erdely and Rolling Stone decided to go ahead and print the story even though she wanted to be taken out. If that's true, Rolling Stone made a grave mistake, because ""a story where the main source tried to back out and the other participants were never interviewed is not a solid story,"" Kliff writes.   It's possible that Jackie's story is fabricated. It's also possible that some parts of her story are true while others aren't. But it's also possible that she was raped by multiple men. And her misrepresentation of certain parts of her story may or may not be her fault. Victims of rape experience a kind of trauma that's hard to imagine for anyone who's never experienced it; sometimes their minds act protectively by blocking memories out. Finally, as Gabriel Dante pointed out to me on Twitter, Jackie may also have altered some facts to ensure that she wasn't identified by readers once the story was published. But none of that matters. The problem here is not Jackie — it's Rolling Stone. The credibility of rape victims will be put into question for years From a journalistic standpoint, it would not have been a stretch to check if the party had actually taken place. It would not have been a stretch to check if the man Jackie said was egging her rapists on was a member of the fraternity. All of this could have taken place without actually talking to the perpetrators — interviews that Erdely insists were intentionally left out of her reporting because Jackie asked her not to speak to her alleged rapists, and because her story looked solid. If Erdely had checked these plot points early on, it's possible that doing so would have halted her reporting altogether. But because those basic reporting steps didn't take place, the credibility of rape victims will be put into question for years to come. And all the incredibly difficult discussions that have taken place over the past year — discussions that gave me hope — are now at risk. victim-blaming is America's favorite pastime Erdely spoke eloquently about her Rolling Stone piece on Brian Lehrer's radio show in late November. During the show, Erdely responded to a caller who claimed that rape reports are often unfounded — she said ""that's actually categorically not true,"" and she's right. On average, Erdely says, only 8 to 10 percent of rape reports are false, which means that something like ""92 percent of them are actually true."" But because she published a sloppy story that is at least partially incorrect, Erdely and Rolling Stone will help perpetuate  the dangerous and damaging myth that women lie about rape. I'd like to think that Rolling Stone isn't powerful enough to walk back the strides we've made in talking about rape and consent this year. I'm hoping that the next few weeks will show that the American public knows who to blame in this fiasco. (Hint: it's Rolling Stone, by managing editor Will Dana's own admission). But the truth is that victim-blaming is America's favorite pastime. The families of Michael Brown, Tamir Rice, and Eric Garner know that all too well. And now, because Rolling Stone failed as a news organization and then made things worse with a terribly vague, accusatory, and hypocritical ""note"" of concern, Jackie and the thousands of women who suffer sexual assault each year will likely be put through hell. Update 12/7: Rolling Stone has, as of Saturday, updated the language of its note to readers, taking full responsibility for its incomplete reporting and acknowledging the subsequent reporting done by The Washington Post. The note now adds, ""These mistakes are on Rolling Stone, not on Jackie.""

Garner's case is the latest in a long string of horrifying deaths at the hands of police. Many of the protests taking place across the country since the shooting death of Michael Brown in Missouri have resulted in disruption of public places; protesters have shut down roads and highways in dozens of cities as a form of civil disobedience.

Activists flooded the store and staged a ""die in"" for four and a half minutes.

Apple is renowned for its carefully managed brand image: its futuristic stores exemplify sleek ideas about a materialistic, affluent future. But tonight that image was taken over by the traumatic reality of life outside Apple's perfect glass cube. As Joshua Kopstein pointed out, the contrast is striking.

Today, Apple continued to make the case that it was fulfilling agreements it made with record labels to patch security holes, versus trying to squash competitors that wanted to create music stores of their own. That was aided by testimony from Apple's head of iTunes software, and incidentally by segments of a deposition of late Apple CEO Steve Jobs filmed months before his death in 2011. ""We had pretty much black and white contracts with the labels."" The plaintiffs in the case brought out the never-before-seen video deposition of Jobs to help paint Apple as a giant. That plays to the complaint that Apple was using its dominance in the MP3 player and music markets in the mid-2000s to squash competitors including RealNetworks and Navio Systems, which at the time were working on ways to get around Apple's digital rights management software. One segment that was shown has Jobs noting that Apple had the ""deepest pockets,"" of any company, and was the biggest of any involved in the space. But the video clips also included Jobs explaining that Apple was required to implement its Fairplay DRM software in iTunes and on iPods primarily because of its deals with record companies, something that's become the company's defensive narrative. Jobs says that any changes Apple made were because of ""black and white"" deals it had with the labels. In particular, Jobs says the company ""went to great pains"" to make sure people couldn't hack its system: I think as best as I can recall, my point of view — and Apple's point of view — we were the only big company involved in this stuff at this time, the one with the deepest pockets. And we had pretty much black and white contracts with the labels that people violated the digital rights management system, on iTunes or on the iPod, and they allowed music to be taken off the iPod as an example and put on somebody else's computer. That would be in clear violation of the licenses they'd have in the labels, and they could cease giving us music at any time. I remember we were very concerned about that. And we went to great pains to make sure that people couldn't hack into our digital rights management system because if they could, we would get nasty emails from the labels threatening us that they were going to yank the license. A little later in the interview, Jobs noted that ""lots of hackers"" were trying to break through Apple's security, making security a ""moving target."" There are lots of hackers trying to hack into these things, so they can do things that would put us in non-compliance with the contracts we have with the music companies, and we were very scared of that. So we would constantly be revving the iTunes and iPod software, closing any holes that might be in it, or any problems it might have. And so this was a moving target. And anybody trying to keep up with that moving target would probably have a hard time doing it, and so we were very concerned with you know, somebody like real promising they would have compatibility when in the future they might not, and that’s not something we could guaranteed, we could get sued by all these people. Jobs then says that any competitors that got locked out by changes in security were ""collateral damage,"" adding that Apple did not want the onus of trying to work with third-party companies in order to get their systems to work with the closed security they'd come up with. ""They're trying to hijack the iPod."" But the plaintiffs argue that Apple's updates to iTunes were not beneficial to users and somehow illegitimate. Instead of adding new features, they say, it was simply shutting others out. Jeff Robbin, Apple's current vice president of iTunes engineering, argued just the reverse while on the stand earlier today, saying companies like RealNetworks were aggressively trying to change how its software and devices worked with their solutions, something that would ultimately end up being worse for consumers. ""We had hack after hack after hack,"" Robbin said. He referred to what RealNetworks did with its Harmony software as one such effort. It allowed users to sync and play songs they've purchased from RealNetworks on an iPod made by Apple. ""They're trying to hijack the iPod,"" Robbin said, pointing to a behavior where RealPlayer's software prompted users to select an option that would automatically launch its jukebox software instead of Apple's when people plugged their iPod into their computer. ""It means that the iPod is stuck in time,"" Robbins said. ""It's no longer going to be updated."" ""It means that the iPod is stuck in time."" Apple's Eddy Cue, who heads the iTunes and cloud services groups, and marketing chief Phil Schiller made similar statements yesterday, saying that the changes the company made to lock out third-parties from its software were intended to keep hackers at bay. That wasn't just for competitors, Cue said, but to keep record labels from pulling out of the entire enterprise. He described a veritable countdown timer that would begin between when a hack was discovered and when the company was required to fix it. If it didn't do it in time, Cue said, the record labels could yank their songs from the iTunes Store and kill off the business. In his testimony, Schiller compared trying to add other DRM schemes to iPods as adding a second steering wheel to a car. ""You can’t have two people driving it, because it will crash up,"" he said. Critics, including the plaintiffs in the case, view Apple's changes as monopolistic, saying that it made these changes to maintain its dominance in both the MP3 player and online music space. The complaint argues that these changes to the DRM specifically targeted people who might want to take their music libraries elsewhere, or use a non-Apple device with iTunes, and that it was able to sell at higher prices because of this. Apple's counterargument has been that other large companies like Microsoft tried to create a DRM standard that worked with third-party devices and failed, ultimately adopting a similarly closed system with the Zune. The trial continues into next week, though Apple filed a motion earlier today to get the entire case thrown out on claims that the one remaining plaintiff representing the class of roughly 8 million customers did not actually purchase an affected iPod. The plaintiffs have since responded by filing to add a new person to represent those customers, something that's expected to be sorted out next week.",0.24857982419251115,0.7514201758074889,0.3269543204397357,1154,4.8561525129982668,505,6.0217821782178218,0,0,"Apple, Policy & Law, Tech, US & World",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

The request comes at the end of long negotiations with the CIA over which portions of the report will be redacted — negotiations made more awkward by the recent revelations that the CIA spied on Feinstein's official computers as her office compiled the report. Secretary Kerry says the current geopolitical climate is too sensitive to allow for the release of the report, although he supports its eventual publication. Still, the request places a serious roadblock at the end of what has already been an extremely difficult path to publication. A leaked summary of the report suggests it will reveal widespread and graphic oversteps by the CIA's detention and interrogation program, which may be politically incendiary no matter when it is released.

You'll be able to explore iconic locations like Tatooine and Hoth, and in the game's virtual toybox Luke Skywalker can play games alongside Black Widow and Wreck-it Ralph. It sounds like it could be a lot of fun, although previous games have been disappointing. But, if I'm being completely honest with myself, it's not the game that has me excited. I'm a 30-year-old father who can't wait to buy some Star Wars toys. The toys-to-life genre, as it's known, isn't new at all. Skylanders made its debut in 2011, and since then has grown into a massive franchise, spawning plenty of sequels and earning publisher Activision more than $3 billion in the process. The concept is simple: the game comes with a little base that lets you scan real-world toys into a virtual world. Each game comes with a toy, but the rest are sold separately, so things can get pretty expensive if you have a collector's mentality. Skylanders never hooked me Skylanders never hooked me, though. While it's big with kids — my five-year-old nephew can't get enough — the Saturday morning cartoon-style characters in Skylanders don't really do much for me. My problem really started with the launch of the first Disney Infinity in 2013. I wasn't that into the game itself, but the slick, wonderfully designed figures proved hard to resist. I'm a huge Pixar fan, and the lure of great figures from The Incredibles and Monsters, Inc. proved too strong.   Things only got worse from there. The second Disney Infinity added Marvel characters, so my ever-growing shelf was soon joined by Venom and the cast of Guardians of the Galaxy. And considering how far into the hole I was, there was no way I wasn't buying a Baymax figure. I mean, come on. Nintendo's amiibo line has had a similar appeal. Having a shelf full of classic Nintendo characters, or new ones like Splatoon's inklings, is surprisingly reassuring. When I'm brainstorming a new story idea I pick up a Kirby toy and just think. When my daughter hangs out in my office, she sits on the floor and plays with Princess Peach and Bowser. The thing is, that's really all I use them for. I stopped playing Disney Infinity a long time ago, and while I play and love a lot of Nintendo games, the amiibo functionality leaves much to be desired. The most I've ever used them for is to get a Yoshi racing suit for my Mii in Mario Kart 8. I know these things aren't exactly useful. And they can be expensive! Amiibos are $12.99 each, and that's not including the mark-up if you decide to snag a hard-to-find toy from an after-market seller. Luckily I'm not a completist, or I'd probably need a raise. Today Disney revealed some of the original trilogy Star Wars figures that will be in the new game, and I already know I'm going to buy at least a few. Darth Vader looks pretty great rendered in the Infinity art style. Meanwhile, Lego is releasing its own take on the genre with Lego Dimensions, and it, too, is making a serious play for nostalgia. Some of the earliest sets announced include The Simpsons, Back to the Future, and Scooby Doo. But unless the game proves to be amazing, I might just sit out Dimensions; I've decided to limit my collection to a single shelf, and it's already getting pretty crowded. Besides, I'm going to need space for that yarn Yoshi.",0.4900850074088132,0.5099149925911868,0.16211729078184145,615,4.6097560975609753,361,5.5623268698060944,0,4,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

The first teaser for The Good Dinosaur makes the movie look as beautiful as any Pixar film before it.

It looks incredibly sweet and honest, and you have to imagine that a lot of people are going to want to watch this. It begins July 26th.   Several years ago, you may have seen the phenomenal documentary Man on Wire, which tells the story of a man who broke into the World Trade Center so that he could string a wire between its two towers and then walk back and forth between them. It's a stunning film and a stunning story, and now it's being dramatized by director Robert Zemeckis (who made Forrest Gump) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt (who's awesome). There's so much in this that makes for a great story — it's an inspirational heist, after all — but this film may push it a bit far. Plus, what's up with JGL's accent? It's in theaters October 2nd.   The Vacation reboot is trying to please a wide audience, and there's an equally wide range of humor in its latest trailer. That's both good and bad — there's some stuff in here that's not so entertaining, and there's some stuff in here that's surprisingly enjoyable. There are bound to be at least a few parts of this that everyone could like. It opens July 29th.   Suffragette follows a group of women in early 20th-century Britain as they fight for the right to vote. It's a powerful subject, and it looks like it has the tone and cast to pull it off. Meryl Streep and Helena Bonham Carter have roles, and the incredible Carey Mulligan stars — basically, this should be great to watch. It opens October 23rd.   Film nerds and Shakespeare nerds alike are going to love this. Michael Fassbender plays Macbeth and Marion Cotillard plays Lady Macbeth in this gorgeous adaptation of Macbeth. What more is there to say? It'll be out this fall.   Crazy! Who would have thought to pair Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach together? But seriously, this movie looks like it'll be absolutely wonderful for certain people. You know who you are. I do. It opens in a small number of theaters on August 14th.   Another one of our favorite documentaries at Sundance is heading to HBO. Larry Kramer in Love & Anger is supposed to be a compelling look at a major figure in the history of LGBTQ rights, and this first trailer touches on just how wide of an impact he had. It'll air June 29th.   This movie seems pretty straightforward… it's part disaster, part adventure, and all inspirational, just a bunch of people trying their best to get up and down Everest alive. The real story here is the cast: Jason Clarke, Josh Brolin, John Hawkes, Robin Wright, Michael Kelly, Sam Worthington, Keira Knightley, Emily Watson, and Jake Gyllenhaal. I don't know how you get that many great actors in one movie. It's out September 18th.   I love the tone and style of this crime drama, which is finally opening in the UK after premiering (and taking in a big award) last year.

Letterman's Late Show was home to a number of great musical performances. The Colbert Report was, too, especially in the later years. Arguably the best ever, in fact, was Jon Batiste and Stay Human in a performance that took the entire audience out of the studio and into the street, where the band and Colbert all sang and dance until commercial break. Guess what? He's now officially the band leader (or ""Musical Friend"") for Colbert's Late Show. It's probably the best pick ever. A little more about Jon Batiste: the Louisiana-born multi-instrumentalist comes from a family of musicians. Batiste has released four albums and three EPs since graduating with a master's degree from Juilliard. In 2012, he was appointed associate artistic director of the National Jazz Museum in Harlem (he currently serves as artistic director-at-large). He also played himself on the HBO series Treme. Colbert's Late Show is just beginning to take shape, at least online. Yesterday it launched its official website, iOS app, and all the requisite social media accounts (Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Google+, etc.). He also shaved the Colbeard. The first episode of Colbert's Late Show will premiere September 8th at 11:35PM.

But the biggest gaming trade show in the world is also home to many games that we already know about. That doesn't make them any less exciting. Some are games that have been known for years, where fans are just itching for any morsel of new information. Others are newly revealed games that have only been teased, with a big, full demonstration happening on stage at E3. Here are the 9 games we’re most excited to see again.   Rumors of the next Fallout have been around for some time, but it wasn’t until this week that Bethesda finally revealed Fallout 4 is officially happening. We still don’t know a lot about the post-apocalyptic role-playing game, despite a lengthy debut trailer. It’ll be set in Boston, and it’s coming to the Xbox One, PS4, and PC. But for everything else you’ll probably have to wait until Bethesda’s E3 keynote. Maybe we’ll even get a release date.   We were able to catch an early glimpse of the next Battlefront game at Star Wars Celebration, but that’s all it was: a look. We saw the beautiful cinematics and got a brief glimpse at the gameplay. At E3 we’re hoping to actually get our hands on the game, to see what it’s like riding a speederbike through a forest and taking down a few AT-STs along the way.   Microsoft and developer 343 Industries appear to be treating the next Halo as if it were two distinct games: and it kind of is. The focus has primarily been on the multiplayer component, but now it looks like things are shifting to the single-player campaign. The game’s October release date was announced alongside a pair of story-focused ads. We know the multiplayer is shaping up well, now it’s time to see how Master Chief’s latest adventure will stack up.   Another year, another Assassin’s Creed. Ubisoft’s time-spanning action series is a mainstay at E3, and this year we’ll be getting a closer look at the recently unveiled Assassin’s Creed Syndicate. The game will introduce some new gameplay elements into the mix, like a grappling hook. The shift to Victorian-era London means more advanced gadgets to play with, and this time you’ll even get to play as a woman, something Ubisoft claimed required too many resources in the past.   After a delay to 2016, Uncharted 4 is no longer this year’s big PS4 release. But we should still be getting a look at Nathan Drake’s next adventure on the show floor at E3. And really, we’ve seen very little of it so far, with only a few teases and previews to date. Hopefully this E3 will show how the next Uncharted will set itself apart from the previous games, which just so happen to be coming to the PS4 later this year.   Just like the new Uncharted, the next Legend of Zelda game has been delayed, and is no longer expected to launch in 2015. But it’s also far and away the biggest title in development at Nintendo, so expect to see a lot of it at E3. We know it’s big, and we know it’s the first game in the series to take place in an open world. But everything else is up for grabs. Update: Our apologies — it turns out Nintendo won't be showing off the new Zelda at E3 this year. We apologize for the error.   In April, Square Enix released a beautiful cinematic trailer to announce the next entry in the Deus Ex series, but since then the publisher has been pretty quiet. Expect that to change at E3. Mankind Divided is likely just the first part of a big push to turn Deus Ex into the next huge blockbuster franchise, and E3 is definitely the place to make a statement like that.   Fans have been clamoring for a new Mirror’s Edge since 2008, and EA finally revealed that a sequel was in the works in 2013. With the game likely to launch early next year, there’s a very good chance that this E3 will be its big coming out party. The original made a name for itself with unique, thrilling, first-person parkour action that hasn’t really been replicated since, so a sequel is definitely overdue.   Perhaps the most anticipated — and ambitious — indie game of all time, No Man’s Sky is a game we’ve seen a lot of since it was first announced in 2013. Since then there have been plenty of trailers and we even got to play a bit of it, but the game is still pretty mysterious. Its huge, beautifully rendered universe is impressive in scope, but the question is whether it will actually be fun to explore. It might even make the perfect companion for Sony’s Project Morpheus VR headset.   Video games that are also toys are all the rage right now. Skylanders is a massive franchise that has earned more than $3 billion to date, and it was quickly followed by similar releases from both Disney and Nintendo. Now the biggest toy company in the world is looking to get in on the action. Lego Dimensions will not only feature the ubiquitous building blocks, but also licensed characters and worlds from everything from Doctor Who and The Simpsons to Batman and Back to the Future. And at E3 we should finally learn how well those toys play together.

Driving the point home further is an assortment of new television shows debuting this year, and the first episode of ABC Family's new reality series Becoming Us — which centers on two Midwestern teenagers, each of whom has a father that is transitioning — is available for a free preview now on iTunes. Becoming Us will begin its run on ABC Family this Monday, June 8th. Approaching its subjects like any other suburban family ABC Family has made somewhat of a name for itself by being remarkably progressive in its programming, with GLAAD citing The Fosters in particular in its 2014 Where We Are On TV study. Judging from the trailer, Becoming Us definitely falls into ABC Family's lighter, family-friendly style of programming, and that's precisely why it's significant: the show is approaching its subjects as it would any other family. But the network is just one of many making strides when it comes to representation. Netflix's Orange is the New Black garnered considerable attention thanks to Laverne Cox's breakout, Emmy-nominated performance starting in 2013, while Amazon had its first true critical hit with Transparent, which features Jeffrey Tambor as a family patriarch who comes out as transgender to his family. And while Sense8 — the new Netflix sci-fi series from the Wachowskis — is an ensemble show, one of its main characters is a transgender woman played by Jamie Clayton who serves as the emotional linchpin of the entire series. Along with that ongoing array of shows and Becoming Us, a set of other reality shows focusing on the transgender community will also be debuting this year, including New Girls on the Block from Discovery Life and All That Jazz from TLC. Of course, the highest-profile program of them all, the upcoming E! series I Am Cait, will debut this July.",0.8036402029049863,0.19635979709501372,0.5367497594007247,334,5.0089820359281436,211,5.8436018957345972,0,0,"Culture, Entertainment, TV",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

The Australian team behind the movie, writer and actor Leigh Whannell and director James Wan, did it again in 2010 with Insidious, an atmospheric ghost story that helped steer horror away from blood and bones and toward spookier scares.  The work paid off: Wan went on to direct Furious 7 (and just closed a deal to helm Aquaman), while Whannell — who wrote and co-starred in the first two Insidious films — is now making his directorial debut with Insidious: Chapter 3. Despite the title, the film is actually a prequel, catching up with the medium played by Lin Shaye as she helps a young woman (Stefanie Scott) who is haunted by visions of a ghastly, wheezing figure in a breathing mask. I sat down with Whannell to talk about his jump into the director’s chair, the challenge of keeping a long-running franchise interesting, and his biggest passion project of all: a fantasy movie for kids.  Bryan Bishop: Let’s start with the obvious question: you’ve been acting, writing, and producing for more than a decade. What made now the right time to jump to directing? Leigh Whannell: I think it was a meeting point of different circumstances. I think James Wan was going off and doing his own thing; he was working on Furious 7, and I knew that once he entered that world of big tentpole movies he wasn’t coming back — he’s not going to come back and do a million-dollar, quickie horror film. So I had to really reassess what I wanted to do; for so long I’d been working as a team with James. And so I decided I wanted to direct, and then the first thought I had was, well, I’ll direct an original film. I’ll write a script, and I’ll go back and basically do Saw all over again. And right at that same moment I was given the job of writing Insidious 3. When I started, I was thinking that I’ll just write this, and someone else will direct it. If it’s not James, it’ll be someone else. And during the writing I just became very possessive of it. I didn’t want to see someone else make those decisions. As I was writing it, I was directing the film in my head — which I usually do, but when I hand the script off to James I’m very trusting of him as a director, so there’s no sense of jealousy or possessiveness. Because I’m all, “Great, it’s in good hands.” But the thought of somebody else that I didn’t know very well coming in and making all these decisions about how the film should look and sound, it was killing me. So eventually I just put my hand up and said I wanted to do it.  That makes sense, because so much of what you need to do to deliver on those scares is camerawork and sound; the nuts-and-bolts, physical filmmaking. When you’re writing, how much of that do you have laid out on the page? I do try and keep my scripts quite economical. I’ve learned over the years to just pare them down to these basic beats. I try to say a lot with one sentence, economically. So the music and the sound and all these different elements of filmmaking, I think that that stuff I’m keeping in my book. I’ve got a book that I’ve got just copious amounts of notes in, but I keep it to myself. But I knew that I wanted a very specific sound design for the film; I wanted the sound to be a character in the film. So it’s kind of exciting, because what happens when you’re a director is you have all these great technicians at your disposal. I mean, these are experts in their craft, essentially enacting your vision, your idea. And how do you go about bringing your own imprint to it, stylistically and directorially, while also making it fit inside the framework of the larger series? Well that’s the big challenge, isn’t it? I had to do both. It did have to be connected to the other films, but I didn’t want it to be a carbon copy of what James had done. And so, in terms of the stylistics of the film, I just tried to think, “Okay, who am I as a filmmaker and a storyteller? What is it that I like? Because I have films that I love that James isn’t as into; I have my own tastes. We’re very similar in a lot of ways, but we’re also quite different. James had quite a flamboyant approach with the other Insidious films, you know, these ghosts in Victorian dresses, and these bright primary colors. He had a lot of Italian influences with those other films, like Dario Argento.  I decided to go a bit more gritty. I was influenced by people like David Fincher and William Friedkin, and these directors who kinda paint their films with these dark shades. That’s what I was trying to do, and still have it be very rich, you know? The challenge has to be even greater because you’re doing this and it’s the third movie. How do you keep a franchise fresh? It’s tough! I think you need to ask yourself the questions that you’re asking me now. You need to be as tough on yourself as a journalist or a critic would be, and you have the time to do that. The writing process is the time where nothing’s been set in stone. It’s a blank slate, or a blank page. And I would just take long walks around my neighborhood. I remember walking around Los Feliz where I live, and I would just think to myself, “Okay, what can I bring to it that’s new?” I’d be really hard on it. And sometimes I would have ideas and scrap that. If I were to show you my notebook that I kept during the writing of that film, there’s a lot of lines through things, where I would scratch it out. And so a lot of the iconography in the film, like the footprints or the breathing, they were all things I felt like we hadn’t seen before in the other Insidious films. The trick is you can do something different, but I can’t show up at the studio and say, “Okay, it’s all in black and white, and it’s set in Poland!” Like, they’re going to throw me out of the room. So the trick is to say, yes it’s still an Insidious movie, but we are not going to go down that same path. No baby monitors, no Victorian dresses; I want a different world. And hopefully I achieved that. You mentioned the breathing [of the main villain]. Where did that character come from? It called back to so many things that creeped me out from my childhood. I started with that blank page, and I thought what can be visually or aurally iconic about this guy? And I started thinking about great villains, and how there’s always pieces of iconography that signify their presence without them having to be in the room. If you think of Freddy Krueger, the glove is probably the biggest piece of iconography. But that glove gives you so much scope, because you just need to hear it dragging on the wall, and instantly, Freddy is around. Or I guess the most famous one of all time is that Jaws theme. My daughter is two years old, and she sits in the bath going “duhn-dun, duhn-dun” with her toy shark! How does she know that theme? It’s like we’re born with this built-in love and knowledge of the Jaws theme. And so I remember writing in my notebook, “I want that Jaws theme,” and that led to the breathing. I felt like the breathing was a good way to signify that this guy was nearby without having to show him, because as soon as you show somebody, you’re diluting the power of their presence in a way. It’s the threat of their presence that’s truly scary. So when I thought about somebody sitting alone in bed at night and suddenly hearing [mimes breathing], I was, “That’s great!” and that led me to the breathing mask.  What about other genres for you? Do you want to step outside horror? Definitely. What’s funny is that since I wrote the first Saw movie I’ve written so many films in other genres — they are just not the films that have been made. I’ve actually written a children’s film called The Myth, which you could say is like a big Harry Potter-esque fantasy for kids, and that’s a film I would love to see get made. That’s a dream project of mine. It’s not something anyone would expect I would write. But because it hasn’t been produced yet, nobody knows it exists. So I feel like there’s a disconnect between what I’ve written over the last few years and how the world perceives me. So I think what I need to do is take care of that myself.

Target's availability will begin the week of August 17th. The Time is a complete overhaul of Pebble's older smartwatches, with a new design, color display, and interface. It works with both Android and iOS, and displays notifications from the phone, controls music playback, and does basic activity tracking. The Time is a much better smartwatch that Pebble's prior efforts, but it doesn't quite match the capability or design of the Apple Watch or the leading Android Wear smartwatches. Pebble will need big support from third-party stores to replicate the success of its first watches Pebble's older smartwatches have been available from Amazon for some time, but it's not clear when Time will join them. While Pebble has been able to build a lot of buzz and raise capital through its Kickstarter campaigns, those don't actually result in large numbers of units sold. If it's going to replicate the success of the Pebble and Pebble Steel, which sold over a million units, it's going to need the support of third-party retailers. Today's announcement is its first step in making that goal a reality. It appears that some Best Buy locations even jumped the gun in the past few days and started putting the Time out on shelves this weekend — hopefully the official announcement will result in better in-store displays than we've seen so far. Update, 1:06PM, July 20th: Pebble reached out to clarify that while Best Buy availability begins today, Target's availability of the Time will start on August 17th.

The company considers Sling TV, which it launched back in January, as the start of ""a whole new industry"" that's still complementary to its satellite service rather than supplementary.

You'll now be able to listen to music from Spotify right within the Nike+ app, but Nike wants this to be about more than simply picking a song and starting your run. Part of the new Spotify integration is a feature called Pace Stations, which asks you to enter your target pace and favorite types of music. From there, Nike+ Running builds a playlist that's 100 songs long and designed to push your performance toward the pace you set — and eventually beyond it. This differs from Spotify Running a bit, because Spotify will automatically detect your pace when you're running with your iPhone and keep playing songs that are appropriate for your current speed. Nike seems more focused on ramping up the music to motivate users and get them moving faster. Personally, I wish Spotify had left this sort of thing to the expects (like Nike), since the app is starting to feel a little busy and is just trying to do too much.

The sentiment shouldn’t come as much of a surprise. After all, this is the director who brought us Titanic, The Abyss, Piranha Part Two: The Spawning, and two IMAX documentaries about the deep oceans (Cameron has said that his upcoming sequels to Avatar will take place in alien oceans). In a rare turn, the notoriously controlling filmmaker’s main role in Deepsea Challenge 3D is in front of the camera, with directorial duties ceded to his fellow explorers John Bruno, Ray Quint, and the late Andrew Wight. The result is an entertaining and educational look at the enormous effort it took to pull off the deepest solo dive in history.  At its best, Deepsea Challenge 3D, a National Geographic film that premieres nationwide this Friday in IMAX 3D, is also a profile of James Cameron himself. What kind of person travels to the bottom of the ocean in a tiny, cramped sphere when he’s not making immensely successful, big-budget Hollywood movies? Deepsea Challenge 3D seeks to have Cameron answer this question for himself, as he oversees the creation and deployment of the private submarine Deepsea Challenger, a 24-foot tall, neon green, blade-like craft straight out of science fiction. When the film begins, construction on his sub hasn’t even begun, but already Cameron outlines his ambitious goals to explore the Challenger Deep, the deepest part of the seafloor on record, located over 7 miles (36,000 feet) below the western Pacific Ocean. The spot had only been visited by humanity once before — by Jacques Piccard and Don Walsh on the 1960 voyage of the Trieste — and only briefly, too quickly to get a detailed look at the environment or any potential lifeforms. Much of the drama in Deepsea Challenge 3D centers around whether Cameron and his team of engineers and explorers will be able to finish building their sub on deadline, and whether it will be reliable enough to protect its pilot from a watery grave. Cameron is much better at explaining the science involved in his mission than he is in revealing what makes him tick. But he does point to one common denominator between his two careers: insatiable curiosity. Through a combination of staged flashbacks and behind-the-scenes footage, we see how the underwater filmmaking equipment he developed for his movies went on to be used for his subsequent scientific dives. Likewise, Cameron admits that marine creatures have inspired the aliens that appear in his films. There’s ""an alien world right here on Earth,"" Cameron says in Deepsea Challenge 3D. ""I’ve seen some pretty astonishing things at the depths."" Deepsea Challenger submarine on a test dive off the Ulithi Atoll. © Photo by Mark Thiessen / National Geographic  We also get to see some of those astonishing things in Deepsea Challenge 3D, thanks to Cameron’s diligence in recording all of his underwater adventures over the past three decades. As the filmmaker who largely kicked off the 3D feature film revival with Avatar, it makes sense that Cameron would insist upon equipping the Deepsea Challenger submarine with two 3D cameras built specifically to survive the crushing pressures of the bottom of the ocean. (""Ten thousand pounds per square inch,"" he reminds us, ""like two Humvees sitting on your thumbnail."") But the film has a tendency to over-rely on his archival footage, in part, no doubt, because his voyage to the bottom of the ocean was actually cut short by mechanical failure — one of the more authentically dramatic moments we witness. Deepsea Challenge 3D also contains sweeping aerial footage that wouldn’t be out of place in Avatar, mostly of the ocean surface and island chains where Cameron and his crew trained for his dive. And there is liberal use of computer-generated effects to recreate the submarine’s descents, a sometimes disconcerting choice, as it makes it harder to tell if what we’re seeing is real ocean photography or not. In fact, Deepsea Challenge 3D’s visual language and plot are so similar to Cameron’s other fictional movies, it’s easy to forget the film is a documentary, and that he wasn’t totally in control of the outcome. That’s both good and bad. Cameron comes off as the ultimate action hero, a grizzled adventurer who alternates between macho wisecracks and grandiose statements about the nature of life and death. But he glosses over relationships with his family and friends, and how they’re affected by his adventures below water. The biggest drawback of Deepsea Challenge 3D is that while we get to explore the deepest parts of the ocean with Cameron as our guide, we only skim the surface of the man himself.

Researchers are also currently looking at ways 3D printing could be used to increase the shelf life of rations, which currently have a minimum lifespan of three years.

Unfortunately, there's currently no timeline for when 3D printing could actually be used by soldiers.

The Verge and other media outlets — including The New York Times, The Washington Post, and Slate — covered the news in a big way, because it meant that government officials were not only urging doctors to prescribe the drug to queer men or individuals whose partners have HIV, but to anyone at risk — including sex workers, heterosexuals, and transfolk. Yet many reporters, myself included, failed to discuss how revolutionary this drug is for one particular, and substantial, segment of the US population: women. Uncomfortable because of ""the imbalance of power between men and women"" ""The idea of women protecting themselves from HIV really hasn't gotten much play,"" says Anna Forbes, staffer at the US Women and PrEP Working Group, which aims to increase awareness about Truvada among women. ""It’s a topic that raises a lot of uncomfortable issues for a lot of people, because it’s not something that we can talk about without talking about the imbalance of power between men and women,"" notably during discussions about safe sex. No matter how you slice it, condom use — even female condom use — requires a partner’s acceptance, and people who identify as women often lack the social capital to impose these sexual barriers. That’s where Truvada comes in: the little blue pill is discreet enough to require no participation from sexual partners who might not be willing to help out. And it's repeatedly shown to be extremely effective at preventing HIV infections when taken daily. There’s no shortage of evidence linking intimate partner violence to inconsistent condom use. In a 2011 study of over 500 heterosexual men in New York City, researchers found that men who are physically violent with their partners are half as likely to report consistent condom use compared with men who aren’t. And another study, published in 2013, showed that women who were physically abused by their partners in the three months prior to answering the survey were more likely to have had sex without a condom than women who hadn’t experienced that type of violence. ""A partner’s involvement is important where possible,"" says Linda-Gail Bekker, an infectious disease researcher at The Desmond Tutu HIV Center in South Africa. ""But there are some situations where this isn’t feasible either because individuals can’t negotiate condoms, or the negotiation ends up being violent."" violent male partners are half as likely to report consistent condom use Thus, the threat of violence during condom negotiation is an important contributor to ""risky sex"" in abusive relationships — relationships that one in three women in the US will experience. And going through these experiences won’t just affect a woman once, as surviving intimate partner violence can significantly decrease a woman’s confidence when negotiating condom use with future sexual partners. ""It’s not that women are stupid, or that they don’t know that they need to protect themselves from HIV,"" Forbes says. Rather, it’s that in some situations ""the cost of insisting on condoms use is often greater and more immediate than the risk of HIV, either because of partner violence, stigmatization, the risk of the break up of a relationship, or community ostracism — it’s just really tough."" All women may feel these pressures at various points, but female sex workers are especially at risk due to the criminalization of sex work in 116 countries around the world. According to Stefan Baral, a physician epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University, sex work criminalization represents ""an additional barrier"" that prevents victims from going to the police when they experience violence. 43 percent of the female sex workers experienced client violence ""Client violence rendered women vulnerable to unprotected and high-risk sex both in the immediate encounter, as well as in future scenarios given their heightened awareness of the violence that could ensue if they refused sex or insisted on condom use,"" a group of researchers wrote in a 2013 study of 35 female-identified sex workers in Baltimore. They found that 43 percent of the sex workers experienced client violence in the month leading up to the study. Many were forced to perform sex acts without a condom, they said, before describing how for one woman, ""coercive condom non-use took the form of client condom removal while he held a gun to her head."" Of course, men — particularly gay men — also experience abuse in relationships. In fact, one in four American men have suffered from intimate partner violence, and in these circumstances, male victims don’t always have the option of negotiating safe sex. But for the purposes of this piece, I’ve opted to discuss the issue of women-identified people on Truvada, because previous articles about the drug have almost exclusively addressed male usage. When the female condom was first introduced in 1993, many thought it would give women more independence and control. But like most other safe sex products that target women (dental dam anyone?), the female condom is still a rarity in the bedroom. There are many reasons for that, but one plausible explanation is that it still involves a partner’s knowledge — a characteristic that makes it far less empowering than women once hoped it would be. ""Women still need the acceptance of the partner to use the female condom, so it’s still the same issue [that arises with male condoms],"" says Erika Aaron, an adult nurse practitioner at Drexel University who specializes in HIV. But with Truvada, ""the user has total control, and it can be taken confidentially — their partner doesn’t need to know — so it’s really up to the woman, and it’s about her own self-empowerment.""  Female condom (Anka Grzywacz / Wikimedia Commons) Of course, there are myriad reasons a woman might want to take Truvada: she's planning to have sex with multiple partners, wants to protect against a condom failing, or is unsure of a partner's fidelity. Truvada can be taken and then discontinued when a user’s circumstances change. ""Any one person will go through periods of high risk and low risk,"" Baral says. ""There will be times when people may want to use this product and then not — there will be times that a woman may feel that she may need the locus of control within herself."" Truvada also provides hope for injection drug users, and because 52 percent of heroin users in the US are women, the pill's potential among that population is huge. The benefits of Truvada for serodiscordant couples in the US (one person is HIV positive and the other isn’t) are equally important, Aaron says, especially for those who wish to have children. Using it lets people ""enjoy the process of pregnancy without all the stress about transmission,"" she says. But if Truvada is the HIV preventative that the female condom should have been, why aren't we talking about it? ""It’s not clear to me why the media isn’t discussing this,"" says Beryl Koblin, principal investigator at the New York Blood Center. ""But one possible explanation is that the populations that are most highly affected in the US are men who have sex with men — they represent an overwhelming majority of new HIV infections."" 48.8 percent of Americans who took Truvada in 2013 were women Every researcher I spoke with echoed Koblin, but most also mentioned that despite the high rates of new infection in men, women still account for 20 percent of new HIV infections each year in the US. Moreover, one in four Americans living with HIV identify as women, and women comprise 50 percent of those living with HIV worldwide. But what's perhaps most striking is that 48.8 percent of Americans who started taking Truvada between January 2012 and October 2013 were women, according to Ryan McKeel, a spokesperson for Truvada manufacturer Gilead. With numbers like that, addressing women makes sense. Yet finding an article about Truvada that doesn't omit these benefits isn't easy. ""I don't really think it’s the media’s fault,"" Aaron says. ""I think that our government has responsibilities to do mass public health campaigns when there is a clear chance to decrease incidence of HIV, and there should be an infrastructure for this."" If there had been a campaign, Aaron says, then it’s likely that the media would have covered the potential the Truvada holds for women. Instead, reporters ""have been finding their own way slowly about this choice that people have.""  Truvada (Jeffrey Beal / Wikimedia Commons) Fortunately, there are people working to enhance Truvada's profile outside of the queer male realm. The US Women and PrEP Working Group, for instance, has organized webinars to raise awareness among health care providers, and met with White House officials last year. During that meeting, ""a cross section of the people working with the FDA urged for better training for providers,"" Forbes says. If these training programs are developed, researchers, clinicians, and government officials will have their work cut out for them. ""At this point, we have very limited knowledge about use among US women,"" Koblin says. ""We need to understand what the uptake is among women and among their providers, because providers in general are not super knowledgeable about [Truvada]."" But these programs won’t just have to support women as they learn to take a pill that isn’t birth control — they'll also have to ensure that Truvada reaches women experiencing abuse. And when clinicians find these women, they will have to help them work around their partners. ""Physicians will have to ask women if having a pill in the house could be a problem,"" Koblin says. ""And people who take the pill need clinical care and regular monitoring — so is that something that will work for them?"" Each case will be different, of course, and Truvada won't be right for everyone, but now that there's a tool that can help women gain some control, it's only fitting that they should know. ""it doesn't have to be a gay thing.""   The only way to do that, however, is to change the conversation. ""I spent a lot of my career working on the female condom, and one thing I learned was be careful about stigmatizing products,"" says Mitchell Warren, executive director at AVAC, a global advocacy group for HIV prevention. ""In the early years, it was majoritarily marketed to sex workers."" As a result, he says, people would often say ""Oh it’s a sex worker product,"" before dismissing it. So, if health care providers want women to start using Truvada, they will have to tailor campaigns to all audiences, not just queer men. ""This could be a life-saving product for everyone,"" Warren says. ""It doesn't have to be a gay thing.""",0.6362860446360304,0.36371395536396955,0.8340654054388738,1800,5.052777777777778,782,6.4565217391304346,0,0,"Science, Editorial, Report",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Now, researchers from MIT are trying to figure out a way to make that bag of chips tell them everything that you said — and apparently they have a method that works.

When later playing back that recording, MIT says that it has figured out a way to read those vibrations and translate them back into music, speech, or seemingly any other sound.  ""This is totally out of some Hollywood thriller."" While a bag of chips is one example of where this method can be put to work, MIT has found success with it elsewhere, including when watching plant leaves and the surface of a glass of water. While the vibrations that the camera is picking up aren't observable to the human eye, seemingly anything observable to a camera can work here. For the most part the researchers used a high-speed camera to pick up the vibrations, even using it to detect them on a potato chip bag filmed 15-feet away and through a pane of soundproof glass.

In some ways it seemed like a risky move. After Amazon first hinted it might raise Prime prices, a study conducted by analysts at Piper Jaffray found that 66 percent of customers said they would rather cancel their subscription or let it lapse than pay a higher fee. But a closer look at the marketplace, and human psychology, shows why Amazon felt confident it could increase its rates without suffering serious fallout. ""It won't pain Amazon to see these people go.""""There may be some people who have Prime but don’t rely on it regularly that will cancel because of this,"" says Wedbush analyst Michael Patcher, who tracks Amazon. But many Prime members were likely a drag on Amazon's finances. Wedbush estimated that at $79 Amazon was barely breaking even, or even losing money, on shipping costs for customers who ordered 20 packages year. That's not counting the $40 per person he estimates it costs Amazon to license streaming media that Prime accounts get for free. ""It won’t pain Amazon to see these people go.""  Change in value of US dollar since launch of Amazon Prime in 2005. (Wolfram Alpha)    The flip side is customers who order only a few items each year or who order so much because of Prime that their additional spending far outweighs what Amazon loses on shipping and media. The company would hate to see them go, but the truth is that isn’t a big fear, because there is very little direct competition for what Prime offers. It would be tough to raise prices on the Kindle, which competes directly with iPad and Nexus tablets, or on Amazon web services, which have to stay on par with Microsoft's and Rackspace's offerings. But there is no other service that offers Amazon’s wide range of products for fast delivery anywhere in the nation, and certainly none that throw in a top-tier streaming video library for free. Companies like Shoprunner can boast free two-day delivery, but they can't do same-day delivery or stream you every season of Dexter in HD. ""You can't have Amazon's low-to-no profitability forever."" There are also external factors, such as rising fuel costs and new taxes, that may have played a role in the Prime price hike.

""You can't have Amazon's low-to-no profitability forever. It's been more than 10 years now!"" The market will be watching closely to see if subscribers bail on Prime over these higher fees. But Amazon’s stock rose yesterday on the announcement, and most analysts feel that consumers' bark will be worse than their bite.

Despite a major publicity and lobbying campaign, the company continued to operate and Ackman’s fund lost as much as a half-billion dollars on the bet. But last week, the Federal Trade Commission announced it was opening an investigation into Herbalife. This was a watershed moment for Ackman and others who followed his lead. The announcement of an FTC investigation seemed to show that his claims about Herbalife had merit, and that one of the biggest players in an often-criticized industry wasn’t merely in the sights of a hedge fund manager; it was also in the sights of the nation’s foremost consumer protection agency. ""A lot could change in the next 90 days."" Details about the investigation are scarce thus far. Herbalife issued a press release stating that the company had received a ""Civil Investigative Demand"" from the Federal Trade Commission — a formal request for documents. But so far the FTC, which has confirmed the investigation, has been mum about which documents it is seeking. ""This is like two people going into a room — FTC and Herbalife — to have a conversation, and everyone trying to listen in through a keyhole,"" says Bill Keep, dean of the School of Business at The College of New Jersey, who co-wrote an often-cited paper on pyramid schemes. But picking through the FTC’s docket of historical pyramid scheme cases and recent decisions, a clear trend emerges: an increasingly aggressive FTC, which is beginning to assert itself after more than 30 years of relative passivity. ""A lot could change — about this industry, and certainly about Herbalife — in the next 90 days or so,"" Keep says. To understand what the FTC is looking for in its Herbalife probe, one has to look back at the FTC’s relationship with multi-level marketing schemes (MLMs). Way back in 1975, the FTC went after Amway — the biggest MLM player in the country at the time, with a sales structure virtually indistinguishable from Herbalife’s today. As the FTC saw it, Amway had two main problems in 1975: its distributors focused on recruiting new people into the sales structure rather than selling products, and distributors made dishonest promises about the riches that new distributors might earn by selling Amway. The FTC’s eventual decision in 1979 kept Amway in business and set some basic MLM guidelines: the ""70 percent rule"" requires that a distributor must sell ""at least 70 percent of the total amount of products he bought during a given month"" at wholesale or retail price; the ""10 customer"" rule requires that distributors ""must make not less than one sale at retail to each of 10 different customers that month""; and the ""hypothetical"" profit rule requires that MLMs must conspicuously disclose the amount of money distributors might actually make when they sign up. But those guidelines are vague. They don’t stipulate, for example, who actually enforces the rules. A 2004 FTC Staff Advisory Opinion was ostensibly meant to clarify things, but it failed to; it implied, among other things, that the 70 percent rule doesn’t really matter. So companies such as Amway, Nu Skin, Avon — and Herbalife — have been free to adhere to the FTC’s rules in whatever way they see fit. But the era of vague MLM guidelines may be changing. In just over the past year, the FTC has made three major declarations about the importance of sales to customers outside the distribution networks of MLMs. The first declaration came in January 2013, when a US district judge issued a restraining order in a pyramid scheme case brought by the FTC against Fortune Hi-Tech Marketing (FHTM). That restraining order prohibited the firm from paying compensation to participants ""unless the majority of such compensation is derived from sales to persons who are not members"" of FHTM’s distributor network. Then, in April last year, in a case against BurnLounge, the FTC noted that compensation unrelated to retail sales was ""the sine qua non"" — the essential ingredient — ""of a pyramid scheme."" And in December, in a case against an MLM called the Global Information Network, the FTC argues the company is a pyramid scheme because, ""There are no sales of product or service to people outside GIN's network, so there cannot be any relation between retail (or external) sales and financial rewards paid in connection with recruitment."" Keep explains: ""Whatever confusion the 2004 FTC Staff Advisory caused regarding internal consumption, FTC actions in 2013 make clear that MLMs need to have substantial retail sales … outside of the marketing program."" He continues: ""MLMs with unenforced policies regarding retail sales, those who fail to document retail sales, and those who conveniently try to redefine members of the marketing program as retail customers despite the fact that they joined under the twin offering of discounted products and a business opportunity are vulnerable to a pyramid scheme charge."" For that reason, Keep and others argue that the FTC’s Civil Investigative Demand last week likely demands that Herbalife come clean about its retail sales. While Herbalife’s promotional materials claim that the company ""offers compensation that is directly linked to the generation of product sales,"" it hasn’t bothered to prove as much; it has, in fact, declined to publicly disclose information about retail sales. The FTC, shut in a room with Herbalife, is likely asking why.",0.5207178186777035,0.4792821813222965,0.8760353158039077,933,5.139335476956056,492,6.2052845528455283,0,0,"Business, Policy & Law, US & World, Report",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

Among the services that Fast Company reports Airbnb is already testing is a car service similar to Uber for helping people get to and from the airport. It's easy to imagine that the service could expand from there too, giving customers an easy way to book transportation to a restaurant or around town.

Uber will now cover drivers so long as they're logged into the company's smartphone app and available to accept a ride — even if there's no passenger in the car when an accident occurs. This liability coverage kicks in only if a driver's personal insurance fails to cover an incident and provides up to $100,000 in bodily injury coverage and $25,000 in property damage. ""Uber is taking this step to eliminate any ambiguity while the insurance industry and state governments update policies and regulations for the new world of ridesharing transportation,"" the company wrote in a blog post. ""We are proud to be the standard bearer on this issue as we believe that this clarity is in the public’s best interest.""

Muzzafar now faces charges of vehicular manslaughter with gross negligence, and Uber has been hit with a wrongful death lawsuit stemming from the tragedy. In that instance, Uber notes that Muzzafar's insurance company offered up the maximum limit of his personal policy. Still, Uber admits the mishap led to ""complex questions"" about liability. With today's announcement, it's seeking to eliminate any worry of a potential insurance gap whenever a driver is logged in. ""Safety always comes first in the cities and communities we serve,"" Uber says. ""We make sure all ridesharing drivers undergo background checks that are among the most stringent in the industry."" That point may come under fire, however, as Muzzafar was arrested for reckless driving 10 years before the New Year's Eve tragedy.

In the course of the screed, Musk states that the laws already on the books originally designed to protect car dealers from powerful auto manufacturers are now being ""twisted to an unjust purpose."" Dealers currently wield considerable clout, and are able to influence policymakers to pass proposals like PRN 2013-138 that force car makers to sell under their auspices and prevent choice.

According to Reuters, democratic state representative Patricia Todd, who is the state's only openly gay lawmaker and the sponsor of the bill, will put Cook's name on it after the Apple CEO spoke out against sexual orientation discrimination at the Alabama Academy of Honor. Cook's speech took place just days before Cook came out publicly in a Bloomberg Businessweek editorial, saying that he was ""proud to be gay."" The combination of Cook's speech and his public announcement that he was gay led Todd to say that she would put his name on the bill, but she then said she was initially speaking in jest. Todd also said that an Apple representative had contacted her, expressing concern about attaching Cook's name to the measure. However, it sounds like those comments reached Apple, and Cook (who grew up and attended college in Alabama) said he was proud and honored to be associated with the bill. In a statement to Reuters, Apple said that ""Tim was honored to hear that State Rep. Todd wanted to name an anti-discrimination bill after him, and we're sorry if there was any miscommunication about it.

We waved signs. We took pictures. We called loved ones, asking them to join us in this demonstration against the systemic injustice of a state that could take a man’s life in broad daylight and yet hold no one accountable. If America hadn’t reached its breaking point on the topic of race in 2014, this surely had to be it. Because on a Wednesday afternoon — less than a week after a Ferguson, Missouri grand jury failed to hold police officer Darren Wilson responsible for the death of Michael Brown — a Staten Island grand jury, despite video evidence that went viral in the months before the hearing, decided not to indict another white police officer in yet another unarmed black man’s death. The officer in question, Daniel Pantaleo, expressed regret after the ruling, saying in a statement, ""It is never my intention to harm anyone and I feel very bad about the death of Mr. Garner. My family and I include him and his family in our prayers and I hope that they will accept my personal condolences for their loss."" Esaw Garner, Eric Garner’s wife, would not be consoled. ""Hell no,"" she said. ""He's still working, he's still getting a paycheck, he's still feeding his kids, and my husband is six feet under."" ""My husband is six feet under."" Sadly, there is nothing unusual about the kind of loss Mrs. Garner has suffered. Black and brown people are brutalized everyday. Black and brown people die. But how it happened should make us wonder how far systemized white supremacy can bend reality despite all our best efforts. After the marching and chanting, all I have are questions. Mainly, when is it enough? When is it enough, when even the facts are ignored? Eric Garner, a horticulturalist who left the NYC Parks Department due to severe asthma, died on July 17th, 2014. He was 43. On the day he was killed, he’d just broken up a fight outside a beauty shop when the police approached him. We know why they were there: Garner was known in the Tompkinsville neighborhood of Staten Island for selling illegal loose cigarettes. It was far from a new charge; according to The New York Times, he’d been arrested twice for the crime this year alone. This time, however, he was firm. He’d done nothing wrong. ""I’m tired of it,"" he said. ""This stops today."" He didn’t threaten. He wasn’t armed. But four officers pulled him to the ground, with Officer Pantaleo putting him in a chokehold. Garner said, ""I can’t breathe."" Then he died, left in handcuffs on a Bay Street sidewalk whole minutes before any attempt was made to revive him. The kind of chokehold Officer Pantaleo administered to Garner has been banned by the NYPD since 1993. By August 1st, the New York Medical Examiner’s Office had determined that Eric Garner’s death was a homicide, the result of a heart attack brought on by the chokehold in addition to his asthma and other ailments. In other words, Eric Garner was murdered. Officer Daniel Pantaleo, however, walks free. ""I can't breathe."" When is it enough, when even technology is ignored? In the months since the shooting death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, a national conversation has erupted concerning whether or not police officers should wear on-body cameras. It’s an imperfect solution; for instance, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), while generally in favor of the technology, rightly argues that police must be barred from selectively choosing what to record. However, in a case like Michael Brown’s, as ugly as it was with conflicting witness testimony, many accept that, if someone had a camera on the scene at the time, Darren Wilson may have been indicted last week. As a result of this ongoing conversation, President Obama this week announced federal funding for 50,000 on-body cameras, and the NYPD will begin testing its own cameras as soon as Friday. We hoped a camera would make a difference for Eric Garner. Ramsey Orta, a friend of his, recorded the entire confrontation on his phone and shared it with the Daily News. The video was uploaded to YouTube, where it was seen by thousands, reuploaded by other viewers, and seen by millions more online and on television. The particulars of Garner’s death that afternoon are a mystery to no one. And all it took was a man with a camera and YouTube to turn us all into witnesses. It sounds like judicial science fiction. We might have caught a whiff of real progress in our justice system with an indictment based on that recording. If not, at least an admission of fault on the part of the officers involved. We might have lionized the internet in its ability to expose real oppression in our society.  Instead, a black man was murdered in front of a live audience and a white cop went free. Meanwhile, the man who recorded the video was himself indicted the following month on weapons charges. When is it finally enough? It defies logic that Officer Pantaleo went free. It is an outrage, not only because it is tragically, pathetically unremarkable that black men should die at the hands of police year after year. We know the game is rigged. Such is life in America. No, it’s an outrage chiefly because we watched this murder happen. Together. And we can watch it still, on TV and on our phones, knowing that murder is wrong, but now knowing that a black man’s life taken for all to see is still worth less than a white cop’s career. Eric Garner was killed in the street in broad daylight on camera for allegedly selling loose cigarettes. And a grand jury called his death a justifiable homicide. That is not only deplorable, but absurd. If the deaths of Michael Brown, Tamir Rice, Trayvon Martin, Oscar Grant, Sean Bell, and every black man killed just in the last decade don’t expose how rooted in horror and despair our society is, this surely must. After the ruling, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) asked reporters, ""What more does America need to see to understand we have a problem in this country?"" Put another way, we were all just told that the Emperor is wearing clothes, and it has never been clearer that he is naked save for a Klansman’s hood. We were told the Emperor is wearing clothes, but it has never been clearer he is naked save for a Klansman's hood Yesterday’s events are so absurd as to even unite conservatives with liberals on the subject, seemingly because we all know what wrongdoing looks like. As Sean Davis at The Federalist writes, ""Just going on the plain language of the law, the police officer who killed Garner certainly appears to be guilty of second-degree manslaughter at the very least."" Elsewhere, Attorney General Eric Holder has already committed the Department of Justice to opening a civil rights investigation into Garner’s death. And maybe that’s enough. Maybe this is the moment where we can finally come together and admit to this American sickness that continues to afflict us. Maybe. But until we can agree on the certainty of oppression with the same conviction we feel about the certainty of Eric Garner’s unlawful death, ""maybe"" is all we will have. So we will keep marching. And the cameras will keep rolling.

This has not been a stellar year for the NYPD's public relations department. In April, the official @NYPDnews Twitter account asked followers to tweet a photo of themselves with an officer using the hashtag #myNYPD. Activists soon co-opted the message, using the hashtag to share photos of police using force. That public relations meltdown may have been what prompted the department to set up a ""Twitter class"" to train officers in the delicate art of social media. Yours truly. RT @NYPDnews: Do you have a photo w/ a member of the NYPD? Tweet us & tag it #myNYPD. pic.twitter.com/olAxGgU4Hs  If it helped, the results aren't clear; yesterday's protests against Eric Garner's death prompted a #WeHearYou tweet, which similarly backfired. But through a Freedom of Information request, The Verge obtained documents related to the class — essentially, the NYPD's lesson plan. Some of the information is enlightening, some is strange, and some seems to have been pulled from a Google search for ""What is Twitter?"" In a section on best practices for official accounts, officers are told they can release public information on parolees through official feeds, but are cautioned against going overboard: Do not editorialize. Inappropriate: John Smith was released today on parole. He is now trolling your neighborhood. If you see him, keep your kids away from him. He's a rapist! Appropriate: John Smith, convicted of a rape in the 88 precinct in 2009, was released on parole today. In the same section, the NYPD's social media team takes a strong stance for First Amendment freedoms: Tweets = First Amendment Speech Just because it's offensive, doesn't mean you can have it removed. Example: ""Officer Smith is a motherf*&ker #DieOfficerSmith"" The tweet is offensive but it is not threatening nor does it violate Twitter's terms of use. ""motherf*&ker #DieOfficerSmith"" would seem, on its face, to be a violent threat that violates Twitter's terms, but maybe not. In either case, an asterisk in this section reminds officers that ""only Twitter can remove tweets."" One apparently anodyne section helpfully defines Twitter for officers, comparing it to instantly texting a group of people and even going so far as to call it ""text-talking."" The section begins, ""Twitter is about sending and receiving group messages. The messages are limited to 140 characters and they are called tweets."" It continues: Twitter by default publishes all of your tweets in a public timeline that anyone can browse. You can make your tweets private, but that severely limits the usefulness of your Twitter account. If people can't browse your tweets because they're private, fewer people will be able to ""follow"" you, and Twitter is all about people ""following"" or text-talking to other people. Although this section appears under the header ""Deputy Commissioner Public Information,"" the section is almost identical to an about.com page called ""What Is Twitter? A Definition of Twitter."" Likewise for the following section in the presentation, which contains definitions for common Twitter terms which also appear on the about.com page ""Twitter Language: Terms and Slang Explained."" The definitions appearing in the presentation and about.com site include three different slang words for Twitter: Twitterati -- Twitterati is slang for popular users on Twitter, people who usually have large groups of followers and are well known. Twitosphere -- The Twitosphere (sometimes spelled ""Twittosphere"") is all the people who tweet. Twitterverse -- Twitterverse is a mashup of Twitter and universe. It refers to the entire universe of Twitter, including all its users, tweets and cultural conventions. Along with other faux pas — ""abusive language or comments"" and ""discriminating or bias information"" are banned — guidelines are provided for officers' personal accounts. In short, they say, don't let the world know you're a cop, and don't post photos of anyone else in uniform.

Last week, we learned that the St. Louis police officer who shot Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager, wasn't being indicted. Officers in Utah won't face charges for shooting Darrien Hunt, a black man killed while cosplaying with a decorative sword. Nor will the officers who killed John Crawford, shot for carrying a toy rifle. An investigation was still underway in the case of Tamir Rice, a black Cleveland 12-year-old who was also shot, in late November, for carrying a toy gun that an officer mistook for real. One of the most cynical pieces of advice that's come out of this is that black parents need to teach their children to be afraid of the police, living under the constant danger that innocent mistakes will have fatal consequences. This advice is usually delivered sarcastically, or at least sadly. But according to the St. Louis County Police's helpful social media team, it's pretty much spot-on.   Earlier today, the official St. Louis County police department linked to one of its precinct's Facebook updates, a PSA about Tamir Rice titled ""Kids will be Kids?"" The rest of the piece is just as bad as its awkwardly casual title: it's a guide to making sure the police don't shoot your children to death. ""This article is not about this, a boy losing his life, whether this was a justified shooting or, whether the cops acted too fast,"" says the piece. ""This is about the Fenton Precinct making residents aware of a hot topic and learning from this incident."" In any other circumstance, there's no reason the police shouldn't ask parents to tell their children not to remove the orange safety caps that mark pellet guns as fake weapons, or say that they shouldn't shoot them within city limits. Or to warn them that police could end up getting called if it's not clear the gun is fake. In theory, even something like this could be okay: If the type of gun is in question by the witness, the Police will respond as though it is a real gun until it can be confirmed one way or the other. ... The police will respond lights and sirens and come to a screeching halt in the area where your child is playing with the gun. Here are some tips to help your child respond appropriately. Do not run away. They need to no longer have the gun in their hands, throw it away from them. They need to comply with officers' instructions. ... Clear communication between your child and the police is essential. But right now, ""responding as though it is a real gun"" (or sword) means almost immediate lethal force. When a friend of Tamir Rice's family asked why police didn't try to use a stun gun, he was told that ""we're not trained to shoot people in the leg."" And it's painfully dismissive of the larger social climate, where police officers are given wide latitude to use force, are unlikely to face any legal consequences for deadly mistakes, and seem disproportionately likely to kill black men with little or no provocation, whatever the cause. On top of everything, it's coming from one of the epicenters of the debate over police brutality. The St. Louis County City of Fenton's police Facebook page is like a modern-day community newsletter, including information about charity drives and a photo of ""two baby fawns growing up near our station."" Unfortunately, it's being distributed to the entire world, and what might once have just been an inappropriate one-paragraph safety PSA ends up blaming children for not behaving perfectly under a terrible status quo. Unsurprisingly, the tweet and Facebook post have been deleted, although you can see the latter below. Later in the afternoon, Chief of Police Jon Belmar issued an apology, saying that his office had not been made aware of the statement until after it was posted and had changed its social media policy to prevent future mistakes. ""I apologize to Tamir's family and anyone who was offended by the post,"" he wrote. ""The post conveyed the message that my officers respond to calls involving a child with a gun with indiscretion and little regard for life.  I want to emphasize that my officers respond to calls with discernment, and have the highest regard for human life.  We train officers to take all facts and circumstances into consideration when making decisions about using force.""   Full text: On November 22nd 2014, a Cleveland Police Officer shot 12 year old Tamir Rice who had his hand on an Airsoft pistol. The Airsoft pistol had the orange warning tip removed. I do not know all the details of the story; I encourage you to research reliable resources and educated yourself about the incident. This article is not about this a boy losing his life, whether this was a justified shooting or, whether the cops acted too fast. This is about the Fenton Precinct making residents aware of a ""hot"" topic and learning from this incident so Fenton never loses a child’s life.  If you or your children have an Airsoft or pellet gun please sit them down and talk to them about this tragedy. Your children should have rules for ""toy"" guns that mirror the rules of a real weapon. Pellet guns and Airsoft guns should not be allowed to be played with throughout the neighborhood, common grounds, or used to threaten or intimidate people. Pellet guns have no orange warning tip because they are considered weapons; Airsoft guns do have orange tip. Please inspect your child’s Airsoft gun to make sure the orange tip has not been altered or removed. These guns are very realistic. Pellet gun laws are the same as any weapon in the City of Fenton. Children cannot carry a weapon and they cannot shoot this weapon within the city limits. Airsoft guns are considered toys, but city ordinance prohibits the ""shooting of any projectile within the city limits"".  Warn them that these ""toys"" do look like real guns and could result in the police getting called on them. The police may get called to respond to ""a child with a gun"", ""maybe a toy gun"", it is important to know how officers are trained to respond. If the type of gun is in question by the witness, the Police will respond as though it is a real gun until it can be confirmed one way or the other. Remember if an Airsoft pistol is tucked in your pants like a holster then obviously the orange tip is no longer visible. The police will respond lights and sirens and come to a screeching halt in the area where your child is playing with the gun. Here are some tips to help your child respond appropriately. Do not run away. They need to no longer have the gun in their hands, throw it away from them. They need to comply with officers instructions. They may be ordered to lie down on the ground. Clear communication between your child and the police is essential. Police need to know that it is a toy gun; I do hope I am explaining a scenario that will never happen in our area. So again, ""kids will be kids"", and your children will continue playing war in the common grounds. Share this with your children; tell this story to families that might need this information, and encourage your kids to talk to classmates about this. Working together we will keep our community a safe place.

The Secure Data Act would ban agencies from making manufacturers alter their products to allow easier surveillance or search, something Comey has said is necessary as encryption becomes more common and more sophisticated. ""Strong encryption and sound computer security is the best way to keep Americans' data safe from hackers and foreign threats,"" said Wyden in a statement. ""It is the best way to protect our constitutional rights at a time when a person's whole life can often be found on his or her smartphone."" The FBI says it's going to start ""going dark"" because of encryption In a speech from mid-October, Comey warned that the FBI was in danger of ""going dark,"" or being technically unable to access evidence on newly encrypted phones and computers. ""The more we as a society rely on these devices, the more important they are to law enforcement and public safety officials,"" he said. Not long before, Apple and Google had announced that they would start encrypting iOS and Android user data by default, a decision that didn't sit well with Comey. In response, he proposed an update to the 1994 Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act, which requires telecommunications companies to provide wiretap access for targeted surveillance. It's a fight the government has picked before and lost (with the Crypto Wars), and the FBI didn't seem likely to do much better this time around. But Wyden is hoping to shut the proposal down before it manages to get off the ground. Where Comey sees a targeted exception, Wyden and others see a backdoor in device security — a vulnerability that would defeat the purpose of user encryption and could be coopted by other hackers. Comey protested that the NSA leaks have given Americans an unrealistic idea of how far government surveillance powers reach, but Wyden says his bill is a way to rebuild trust in American technology companies, something that's been undeniably shaken by the information Edward Snowden leaked over the past year. The FBI declined to comment on the bill, but a spokesperson referred us to a portion of Comey's statement earlier this year: ""There is a misconception that building a lawful intercept solution into a system requires a so-called 'back door,' one that foreign adversaries and hackers may try to exploit. But that isn't true. We aren't seeking a back-door approach. We want to use the front door, with clarity and transparency, and with clear guidance provided by law."" In the House of Representatives, Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-CA) took up the issue of government encryption rules earlier this year. She passed an amendment to the annual defense funding bill that bans requiring companies to install security vulnerabilities, a move that was lauded by civil liberties groups.

The program was compiled just days before the attack At the same time, North Korea is already denying its involvement in the attack, today issuing its strongest statement yet. ""My country publicly declared that it would follow international norms banning hacking and piracy,"" a North Korean diplomat told Reuters. Many believe the attack was retaliation for Sony's upcoming film The Interview, which depicts a comedic assassination attempt on North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, although the studio has denied reports that it is planning to accuse the country of the attacks. Still, AlienVault' analysis provides the most definitive evidence so far connecting North Korea to the attack, particularly given how specifically the program targets Sony. The malware Blasco analyzed used a simple login and password to gain access to Sony's system, suggesting the attackers had already gained access to company data elsewhere. Once they had that access, this program was used to wipe the company's hard drives, take down the email system, and display the now-notorious skeleton graphic. Even if some of the code was reused from preexisting malware, the new analysis from AlienVault suggests the program was customized and deployed by Korean speakers, strongly implicating North Korea's state hackers in the attack.",0.7488632984721528,0.2511367015278472,0.8611830490303255,310,5.274193548387097,192,6.203125,0,0,"US & World, National Security",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

Now show us your ticket or get lost. That's what officers of the New York Police Department told hundreds of people tonight as they cordoned off a massive area in midtown Manhattan, trapping protesters, tourists, workers, residents, and others between barricades that stretched out of sight along 6th Avenue and across two long blocks to Madison Avenue. It was a confluence of two discordant events: NBC's lavish celebration of Christmas spirit, and the mourning of yet another unarmed black man viciously killed by police. I was in the crowd created by the NYPD and found myself stuck in close quarters with no escape for at least half an hour near Radio City Music Hall, as tourists and protesters jostled to find out what was going on and where they could go. The message was clear: the right of citizens to peacefully assemble in public spaces is less important than making sure NBC's Christmas television special in Rockefeller Center — you know, the one where they light the big tree and have Mariah Carey sing — is packed with happy faces.  The First Amendment is less important than an NBC special People are protesting across the United States tonight over a New York grand jury's stunning failure to indict a police officer who killed Eric Garner in a chokehold: a tactic forbidden by the NYPD. The protests are an extension of those seen across the country in response to Michael Brown's death, and have intensified since a grand jury in that case also decided not to indict the officer involved in Brown's killing. Eric Garner's killer, officer Daniel Pantaleo, placed him in the hold as Garner said ""I can't breathe"" several times. Garner was unarmed and outnumbered by police who stood by as Pantaleo choked him. Video evidence of the killing quickly spread on YouTube, and the medical examiner in the case ruled Garner's death a homicide. He was killed for selling loose cigarettes. NYPD are asking people to clear the area even though they literally can't pic.twitter.com/s0ldg0YBxr  The NYPD's response tonight, at least in midtown, was completely inappropriate as a preemptive move against peaceful protesters. Moreover, it was dangerous; the police cordons pushed hordes of people together as officers asked those without tickets to the Rockefeller show to disperse, even though the NYPD had essentially trapped large crowds together. The people they were ostensibly protecting — those wanting to see a Christmas tree — also ended up trapped: elderly, children, parents. The NYPD's blockade went far beyond event management; the size of the cordon and the presence of police with batons and riot visors was clearly in response to protests. The department did everything in its power to keep protesters far away from NBC's cameras. If the police were trying to stop people from blocking traffic, they failed NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton foreshadowed the department's response earlier today, telling CBS that he did not anticipate any violence. So why did the NYPD decide to make matters worse by agitating pedestrians and protesters alike who were assembling and traveling peacefully on public streets? There is no reasonable explanation for the massive lockdown except to keep protesters off public streets adjacent to a corporate television event. If the NYPD was attempting to keep people from blocking traffic, they failed; the department itself, in its cordon along 6th Avenue, blocked traffic by standing in the middle of the road and parking their vehicles there. ""We've been preparing in multiple ways for months now, conducting a series of community meetings throughout the city,"" Bratton said. ""And we've been tactically preparing in terms of bringing in resources to deal with any potential eventuality."" Sadly the ""eventuality"" Bratton appears to be referring to is the right of people to travel freely on public streets and exercise their First Amendment rights. Officers facing protesters smirked at several slogans shouted by the crowds. I asked more than a dozen officers, including two sergeants, why the police were blocking lawful pedestrian movement. I was mostly ignored outright, or referred to the NYPD's public relations office in other cases. The #NYPD is committed to rebuilding public trust. #Wehearyou   If police departments in the United States want to build trust with communities, they should start by not killing innocent, unarmed people.

To do that, Apple's iTunes chief Eddy Cue today spent several hours testifying in an Oakland, California courtroom, mainly trying to explain why the company not only created its own digital rights management (DRM) software, but also why it didn't share it widely with others. At odds in the case is whether Apple's Fairplay DRM encryption made it harder for consumers to use music software and services other than iTunes. The plaintiffs in the class action suit complain that Apple made its software worse for consumers when it tried to lock out would-be competitors, while Apple says it was necessary to secure digital music files in order to license music from the major record companies, and that any changes were made to improve security of that system. ""We thought about licensing the DRM from beginning."" In testimony today, Cue argued that Apple abhorred DRM, but had to implement it in order to broker deals with record lables that collectively controlled 80 percent of the music market. After investigating existing solutions, Cue says Apple decided to make its own called Fairplay, which it contemplated licensing to other companies. But today Cue said that there were technical issues keeping that from ever happening. ""We thought about licensing the DRM from beginning, it was one of the things we thought was the right move that because we can expand the market and grow faster,"" Cue said. ""But we couldn't find a way to do that and have it work reliably."" As issue, Cue said, were things like interoperability with the growing multitude of MP3 players. New devices from other companies would come out, and might not work with that system. ""Others tried to do this, and it failed miserably,"" Cue said. ""One of those was Microsoft."" Cue also noted that when Apple first floated the idea of the iTunes Store to record labels, that they rebuked the idea because they had their own stores with DRM systems that could be different from song to song, and from device to device. Fairplay DRM still exists for music Apple still uses Fairplay, including for music — though not in a way that customers see when downloading something from its store. As Cue explained, the company uses it to secure encrypted music files on its servers, but that it's removed when someone buys a song. It also continues to use Fairplay on apps and ebooks. Cue's been with Apple since 1989, and is currently in charge of the company's media business, including iTunes and the App Store. That group pulled in $18.06 billion in revenue for Apple during its latest fiscal year, or about 10 percent of the company's total sales. Cue also oversees Apple's advertising and cloud services businesses, Siri, Apple Maps, and more recently its payments platform Apple Pay. The DRM issue comes into play with the plaintiffs in the case claiming the system locked them in, and actively kept third parties from attempting to open it up. Companies like RealNetworks, makers of the RealPlayer software, and a startup called Navio Systems were designing ways for people to use iPods without iTunes, as well as DRM-protected music from the iTunes Store with other MP3 players. Apple responded by locking down its software to shut those companies out. The plaintiffs say that by doing that, Apple was acting to secure a monopoly by limiting consumer choice. ""We had a time to fix the problem, or they could take all their music off the store."" Apple's own defense of the claims is a bit more complicated. Much of the case hinges on whether updates made to iTunes added new features and improved the software, versus simply attempting to shut out efforts to sync up music to iPods with something else by adjusting its DRM and supporting software. Apple's argument is that it was reacting to efforts to circumvent its security and keep buggy software from interfering with iPods and iTunes versus trying to squash competitors. There were onerous security contracts with the record labels too, Cue said. ""If a hack happened, we had to remedy the hack within a certain time period,"" Cue explained. ""We had a time to fix the problem, or they could take all their music off the store ... we’d have to drop whatever we were doing and go work on those [hacks]."" Testimony earlier in the week focused on the inner workings of iTunes, and how the software was designed to keep third-party software from making changes — something Apple views as it simply fixing a vulnerability in its own security system. ""I discovered that the system was not very good,"" said Augustin Farrugia, a senior director of internet security and DRM at Apple, referring to iTunes security, which he was in charge of evaluating after joining the company in early 2005. ""I discovered that the system had flaws everywhere ... it was easy to steal content from the iTunes Store."" ""It was easy to steal content from the iTunes Store."" Farrugia went into deeper detail during his testimony on Wednesday, saying that the company viewed anyone trying to inject code as an attacker, whether they were a malicious hacker or another company. That prompted probing questions from the plaintiffs' attorney Patrick Coughlin about whether Apple's solution, which involved wiping all the songs from a user's iPod if it detected unauthorized music with DRM then prompting them to resync, could have been implemented better. Cue indirectly responded to that today, saying that letting other stores and devices into that system would have broken things, and caused headaches for both Apple and consumers. ""It wouldn’t work,"" Cue said. ""That integration we created between the three products would start failing, and start having issues ... there’s no way for us to have done that and had the success we had."" The trial is slated to run another six days.

Actively monitoring over 1,200 inboxes For the most part, it involves active surveillance of the people involved in setting up the standards. The new documents detail a project called Operation Auroragold, which kept an eye on more than 1,200 inboxes involved in cell phone encryption, including the influential GSM Association in London. By monitoring any new encryption proposals before they were made public, the agency was able to get a head start on finding ways to break the new systems. The NSA has struggled with cell phone surveillance in recent years, reportedly collecting only 20 to 30 percent of call records for US phone calls, so a program like Auroragold could be seen as a natural way to catch up. Still, it runs the risk of alienating members of the GSM Association, which include both physical infrastructure partners and major companies like Facebook, Microsoft and AT&T.

According to Polygon, customers will be able to preorder an Alienware Steam Machine through Steam or GameStop. They'll also be able to preorder the Steam Link, which lets players stream games from a high-powered PC to other machines in their house, and the Steam Controller, Valve's more versatile take on a console gamepad. All three will be available in stores on November 10th, with a limited number of preorders shipping October 16th instead. The controller and the Link are $49 each, and Alienware's Steam Machine starts at $449 (including a controller). That gets you what looks like a mid-range PC, with Intel's lower-end Core i3 processor, a 500GB hard drive, and a relatively modest 4GB of RAM. The machines go up to $749, with the most expensive model running a Core i7, 8GB of RAM, and a 1TB hard drive. As with other gaming PCs, users can upgrade these parts themselves as they age, but they can't do the same with one of the most important parts: the custom Nvidia GeForce GTX graphics card, which is built into the motherboard. The graphics card is supposed to perform at the level of a GTX 860M or better, which makes it more powerful than a console but less powerful than a high-end PC. Of course, it's also quite a bit cheaper than those PCs. These will be the first machines with Valve's custom controller Alienware is only one of several companies building Steam Machines, and a number of them are expected later this year. Today, PC maker CyberPower will also be taking preorders through its own site for a November release. Technically, anyone can make their own ""Steam Machine,"" and several companies (including CyberPower) already have. It's just a PC running Steam OS, which is free and currently available in beta. But these will be the first machines to actually use Valve's controller, which is supposed to be a major selling point — it's as couch-friendly as an Xbox or PlayStation pad, but the analog sticks have been replaced with (allegedly) more precise trackpads and virtually every control on it can be remapped for specific games. While plenty of games work fine with a normal console controller, this is meant for the subset that's either too old or two PC-specific to make the jump. The major limiting factor is that Valve's operating system will only run Linux games, unless players use the Link to stream them from a separate Mac or PC. Valve has been pushing Linux compatibility in preparation for the launch, and between 1,000 and 1,200 games are supposed to be supported by November. That's between a quarter and a third of Valve's total library, based on the over 3,700 games it touted late last year. This is a long-overdue release for a concept that's been hyped since 2013. Steam Machines were meant as a way to nudge console owners onto a PC path, and the first wave was officially announced in January of 2014. But they were released somewhat unofficially, especially after Valve ended up redesigning its controller, and there weren't clear reasons to use Steam OS instead of Windows or another flavor of Linux. Now, they're getting an official boost from Valve, incidentally set for release around the same time as Valve and HTC's Vive VR headset. The two projects might have limited overlap, though — like the Oculus Rift, the Vive is almost certainly going to require a high-powered gaming rig. And that's something that many Steam Machines emphatically won't be.",0.5822928838752869,0.4177071161247131,0.4176688732364295,611,4.8903436988543367,341,5.8299120234604107,1,0,"Culture, Entertainment, Gaming",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

One of the best aspects of E3, the annual video game convention, are the surprise announcements, marking the return of a popular franchise or the birth of something new. At the same time, I feast on rumors like they're Thanksgiving day leftovers. I want to be surprised, but I also sort of want everything spoiled.  I hope this year's E3 will have plenty of surprises, but after thinking about what announcements make the most sense, I believe I've compiled a list of 12 likely big reveals. Mind you, these predictions are based on rumors. I wouldn't make any bets on what follows. But if you're like me and you'd like a preview of what might be, read on.   Microsoft has teased the Battletoads announcement so excessively, that I wonder if Phil Spencer has some secret bet with Sony’s Kaz Hirai over who can send NEOGAF into the fastest tizzy. British studio Rare hasn't made a new Battletoads since 1994, but its characters have begun popping up in new games, like Rare’s own Kinect Sports Rivals and indie darling Shovel Knight. Microsoft, which has owned Rare since 2002, filed for the Battletoads trademark last year. And Spencer himself sported a Battletoad T-shirt at CES in January that went uncommented on (above). Not to mention a Battletoads announcement would make an obvious lead in for…   A little disappointing to think that younger video game fans might not know the name Rare. The studio’s talent as of late has been misused, entire teams tossed at doomed Microsoft Kinect projects. But in the 1990s and early 2000s, Rare was dominant, creating the Donkey Kong Country and Banjo-Kazooie franchises, Killer Instinct, Goldeneye, Perfect Dark, Jet Force Gemini, and Conker’s Bad Fur Day. All of those games were published by Nintendo, causing some contract paralysis over the years following Rare's acquisition by Microsoft. Donkey Kong Country is owned outright by Nintendo, so that’s a non-starter, though almost a decade ago Nintendo’s Reggie Fils-Aime hinted at negotiations for a port of Goldeneye that would please all parties. In the words of that kid from Angels in the Outfield, a movie that you will remember if you were old enough to play Goldeneye when it was released: ""It could happen."" Sadly, the world seems to have forgotten Jet Force Gemini, but the remaining titles — Banjo-Kazooie, Perfect Dark, Conker, and Killer Instinct — have been remastered or reimagined in some capacity on an Xbox console. Here's how to make money: take stuff people already love, combine it with other stuff people already love,  add copious fan service, and sell the package at an inflated price. And if none of this is meant to be, we have Yooka-Laylee, Banjo-Kazooie's Kickstarter-funded spiritual successor.   Prey 2’s 2011 E3 demo was one of the most impressive presentations I’ve seen at a trade show. How much of what was shown was a playable game, and how much was a staged cinematic, is tough to say. That version of the game was caught in conflict between its initial developer Human Head and its publisher Bethesda; late last year Bethesda announced Prey 2 had been officially canned. I think that’s kind of true. But I also think Kotaku’s report that Prey 2 was moved to Arkane Studios, the developer responsible for Dishonored, is also true. Yes, technically Prey 2 is dead, because now it has a different name, and that name (and the game, which is rumored to be more like a spiritual successor to System Shock 2) will be announced at E3 or Bethesda’s QuakeCon in July. Also, I can’t mention all of this without including my favorite leaked email, in which Arkane creative director Raphael Colantonio appears to refer to reporters as (language warning) ""press sneak fucks.""     Far Cry 4 sold 7 million copies in its first six months, shattering Ubisoft’s own expectations. Ubisoft doesn’t just annualize a successful series, it releases multiple games in that franchise in the same year. At the very least we should see one new Far Cry project in 2015. I’d say Watch Dogs gets a similar treatment, but I’m less confident the franchise is ready to ramp up production following the critical lashing the original received.   I don’t know what the hell Hero is, but it looks weird and promising, and it’s remained a pretty good secret outside of this leaked video (above). With The Division, Assassin’s Creed: Syndicate, and Rainbow Six: Siege obvious talking points from Ubisoft at E3, the publisher will need some sort of surprise besides more Far Cry. Prince of Persia rumors have been on again / off again for some time, so Hero seems to be the more likely prospect. Update: Twitter pal Anthony Mazel directs us to this tweet from voice actor Robin Atkin Downes.      Maybe Square-Enix won’t say as much on stage, but every publisher would like to have at least one annual series along the lines of Battlefield, Call of Duty, and Assassin’s Creed that guarantees some financial predictability. Square-Enix can’t expect a new Just Cause every year, and Tomb Raider is looped into Microsoft’s curious exclusivity deal. That leaves Deus Ex and Hitman, and the former is the more mainstream of the two, which is jaw-dropping considering Deus Ex is a game about the politics of identity, bionics, and human progress. We’ll see more Deus Ex this year with the already announced Deus Ex: Mankind Divided, and I suspect we’ll see it every June until people stop buying them.   Like a handful of games on this list, Mafia 3 has a fraught backstory. 2K Czech was rumored to have trouble shipping Mafia 2, with development announced in 2007 and the release almost three years later to the day. Nearly half a decade has passed since that game’s release, 2K Czech hasn’t released a game since Top Spin 4 in 2011, and Mafia 3 remains unofficially in development. 2K and its parent company Take-Two have shown unparalleled patience with big projects in the past, including the the Rockstar Game catalog and the XCOM and BioShock franchises. Last year, 2K confirmed that the 2k Czech studio consolidated and some work on the team’s project was offloaded to the company’s ""main studio in Novato, California."" The trouble is the main studio could be one of two things, neither especially encouraging from the outside: It could be 2K Marin, which saw substantial departures following the release of the long-delayed The Bureau: XCOM Declassified. Or it could be the new 2K studio Rod Fergusson established in September 2013,  only to leave in December of the same year to lead….   This one’s a little bittersweet. While Gears of War 4 led by Rod Fergusson (a developer known for getting tough projects like the original Gears of Wars series and BioShock Infinite out the door on deadline) is promising, we’re left wondering what could have come from the entirely new franchises formerly in development at The Coalition, neé Black Tusk. One of the untitled projects was even shown at E3 2013. But you don’t change the name of your studio to a fictional alliance from the Gears of War franchise if you don’t plan on focusing wholeheartedly on the franchise.   No, we almost certainly won’t see that bizarre rumor from three years ago about a Starfox and Metroid mashup come to fruition, but we should see a stand-alone for at least one of the properties. Starfox seems especially likely, following the brief, vague announcement at last year's E3. The likely candidates for developers are Next Level Games and Retro Studios. Next Level created Luigi’s Dark Mansions, Super Mario Strikers and the Punch-Out!! reboot; they haven’t released a game in two years; and they’re hiring a 3D level designer and quality assurance contractors. Meanwhile, Retro Studios developed the fan-favorite Metroid Prime trilogy, but hasn't created a new Metroid since 2007.   EA will focus on Star Wars: Battlefront, which should see a release this fall, but they will probably also make a little time to tease the Star Wars game from Visceral. The director of the game, Scott Warner, has been dropping hints on Twitter in the past week, kind of, sort of alluding to an open-world Star Wars adventure.   The Five Nights at Freddy’s trilogy — which at its base level is about monitoring security camera — has been a fountain of wealth for its humble creator. Last year, Nintendo briefly presented a game with a somewhat similar design, in which the player monitors 12 security cameras, firing at enemies with remote-controlled weapons. Think Five Nights at Freddy’s meets tower-defense and you have Project Guard. Nintendo’s smaller demonstrations sometimes disappear, never to be seen again, but with Five Nights' staggering, continued success,  expect Nintendo to fast-track the project for a release this year — probably as a downloadable game or part of a mini-game collection.

In Colour, Jamie xx’s debut solo LP, feels like it's taken up permanent residency in that moment. It’s an album where the wait is just as important as the thing you’re waiting for; an album where what has already happened is just as important as what will happen. What has already happened in the history of dance music is the starting point for Jamie xx (born Jamie Smith). Smith is obviously nostalgic for a scene that doesn't exist anymore, a feeling that’s reflected in In Colour’s almost obsessive chronicling of early UK dance music. He boils down rave music to its core, slices off bits of grime and house, and packs it all in a box lined with shreds of dancehall. Such unapologetic referencing could come off as static in the hands of another musician, but Smith's beatwork is subtle and flexible enough to sound like new territory. These textures aren’t pulled from Smith's own 26-year memory, they're a collaged-together fantasy of a superfan born too late to experience any of it first-hand. The LP’s opener, ""Gosh,"" samples an episode of DJ Ron and MC String’s mid-'90s BBC Radio 1 show One in the Jungle that never actually aired. Smith fits that BBC sample into a classic UK garage beat like he’s collecting things he wants to remember later. ""Sleep Sound"" could soundtrack a dream sequence from 1992. ""Hold Tight"" sounds like a radio broadcast funneled through a thin film of house music.  For all the time it spends looking over its shoulder, In Colour is an album that knows where it wants to fit into the current cultural landscape. When it came to the Young Thug and Popcaan-featuring ""I Know There’s Gonna Be (Good Times)"" Smith explicitly said his goal was to make a summer jam that might get play on the New York radio station Hot 97, and he knew he couldn’t do that alone. The combination is a perfect balance: where Smith is cautious and slick, Young Thug's vocals are elastic and messy. Where Smith is an academic purist, Popcaan is almost soporifically casual. Smith spends some time revisiting his own history, as well: specifically, as the producer and DJ for lonely-pop trio The xx. His xx cohorts Romy Madley Croft and Oliver Sim both show up on In Colour, and their contributions act like speed bumps for the album's breathless pace. ""Loud Places"" pairs Idris Muhammad’s 1977 disco hit ""Could Heaven Ever Be Like This"" with Croft’s hushed sorrow. ""Stranger in a Room"" pumps air into Sim’s dead-eyed baritone, making the song feel more like a lullaby than one of Sim's usual dirges. At its core, In Colour sounds like the LP Smith has been waiting for someone else to make. It's a fan's album; it's a shrine. And while its walls and doors and windows have all been collected from other, long-gone structures, the foundation and construction is all Smith. In Colour's mining of the past might be frustrating to some, but it's only because Jamie xx is a little too much like anyone who's ever purchased an artist's entire discography in one rushed moment of admiration. If In Colour is uncomfortable for dance music obsessives, it's probably because it hits too close to home. In Colour is an album so devoted to its own material it’s almost fearful of making a mistake. So unsurprisingly, there are almost almost no missteps here (""Obvs"" doesn’t quite know what to do with the steel drum, but it knows those twinkles sound nice). It’s an album from a young kid who never got to go to a '90s rave, but who can craft one that's almost more real in his imagination. And because he wasn't there, he never had to leave. He can replicate that feeling, that moment right before the hook, and stay there as long as he wants. The party doesn't need to end.",0.48531327613590886,0.5146867238640911,0.15685533410723643,681,4.701908957415565,403,5.7295285359801484,0,0,"Culture, Entertainment, Music, Music Review",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

While we only have a teaser trailer and some artwork to go on, Kabam describes the game as a ""deep RPG experience,"" which will include the ability to play real-time co-op with friends. You'll be creating your own character from a variety of classes — including, naturally, bounty hunter — and visiting classic Star Wars locations like Hoth and Cloud City.   A mobile movie tie-in isn't usually something to get excited about, but Uprising appears to have a solid team behind it. Among the development staff are Daniel Erickson, who served as creative director on EA's MMO Star Wars: The Old Republic, as well as Danny Keller, who worked as an artist on the Clone Wars animated series. Kabam is typically known for free-to-play mobile strategy games, but recently branched out with the excellent, Diablo-like Spirit Lords. The game will launch sometime before The Force Awakens hits theaters in December, though no official release date has been announced. In the meantime, a beta will be rolling out in select countries over the coming weeks. The worldwide rollout is expected sometime during the fall.

Thanks to a handful of new novels, The Clone Wars and Rebels TV shows, and the movies themselves, parts of the universe are already in place, but as partners such as book publisher Del Rey and comics powerhouse Marvel scramble to fill in the gaps before Episode VII's launch, there are still plenty of opportunities to drop proton torpedo-sized story bombs on Star Wars fans. We need to talk about Han Solo And the biggest one of these so far has just hit. For those yet to read the latest issue of Marvel's ongoing Star Wars line of comics, consider this a spoiler warning. For others, there's something you need to know about Han Solo. He may be a smuggler, a scoundrel, and stuck-up, half-witted, scruffy-looking nerf-herder, but Solo is also — according to issue six of Marvel's comic — a married man. The latest comic unveils one Sana Solo, a female human character first introduced as a mysterious masked figure searching for Han in Tatooine's Mos Eisley cantina. Han's not actively cheating on Sana with Leia — Marvel's Star Wars takes place between Episodes IV and V before he and the Princess make it official — but it seems a little strange that he wouldn't mention a significant other at any point during multiple movie appearances. Perhaps he and Sana could be broken up by the time The Empire decides to Strike Back, or perhaps the ceremony was completed outside of Imperial jurisdiction, or perhaps amoral criminal Han Solo just didn't want to mention his wife as he tried to hit on new people. However it plays out, this is by far the biggest change to an established Star Wars character yet, and to have it happen to one as pivotal and ever-present as Han Solo feels particularly surprising. To me, it's like finding out that one of your parents has a secret family that they've not been telling you about. I'll be able to cope with the change in time, but I just need some space.

The ads hint at an incremental improvement process for Windows 10, suggesting that as the kids grow and ""get better at things,"" the operating system will too — rather than releasing Windows 11 in five years' time, Microsoft intends to keep Windows 10 growing as fast as the toddlers it uses in its ads.

In other words, a robot is closer to the secondary definition found on my computer: rōˌbät | noun: 2. A machine resembling a human being and able to replicate certain human movements and functions automatically. I’d only add ""… like murder."" To know the meaning of ""robot"" you only have to trace its etymology back to the 1920s when Czech playwright Karel Čapek premiered his play titled Rosumovi Univerzální Roboti (Rossum’s Universal Robots). RUR is a story about the production of artificial people called ""robots"" who eventually rise up against their human inventors just as Elon Musk fears. Every robot is not a robot just as every drone is not a drone. A Parrot quadcopter is something entirely different from those Predator killing machines flown by the CIA, just as a Roomba will never be repulsed by the smell of your rotting meat-suit like a T-800 Terminator. By diluting words like ""drone"" and ""robot"" we conspire to neuter the threat they pose to humanity. So please, I beg you, be careful with your words. Someday, when someone screams, the robots are coming! our first reaction shouldn’t be, oh good, these floors could use a good scrubbing.  Casual sex and cheating network Ashley Madison has reportedly been hacked, compromising the user databases, financial records, and private details of the service's owners and 37 million users. Security researcher Brian Krebs first reported the leak last night, which was subsequently confirmed by Noel Biderman, the CEO of Avid Life Media. The company runs Ashley Madison and two other sites for users to arrange sexual liaisons — Cougar Life and Established Men. Microsoft is leveraging the power of babies in its first Windows 10 ads. The company has produced five new ads, each using footage of children from across the globe gurgling, waddling, and gnawing on their feet as a voiceover explains that they will have an easier life because ""these kids will grow up with Windows 10."" German Android fansite All About Samsung has posted images of what appears to be Samsung's Galaxy S6 Edge Plus, the upcoming uper-sized version of the company's curved S6 Edge flagship. The S6 Edge Plus looks to be around the same height as the Galaxy Note 4, but slightly less wide, its curved screen reportedly clocking in at 5.7 inches — much larger than its baby brother's 5.1-inch display. ""We’re walking into the cipher phone age."" That's the way Turing Robotics Industries CEO SYL Chao introduces the Turing Phone, an Android smartphone that aims to put security, durability, and fashion above all else. In a myriad of ways, the Turing is anything but your typical phone. There's no headphone jack, and the thing doesn't even have a USB connector. Instead, you charge it with a plug that looks like a clone of Apple's MagSafe. NASA’s New Horizons spacecraft snapped the first high-resolution photographs of Pluto and its moons this week.

Planetary scientists are now using the images to figure out what they can learn about Pluto’s origins — based on the rock’s surface features.

Those features are hallmarks of Apple's just-launched Music service, and others such as Pandora and Google Play Music hang their hats on the ability to serve up the right music tailored just for you. Spotify, for its part, has enhanced its intelligent music suggestions this year with its new Now feature that provides a variety of playlists, podcasts, or video clips based on the time of day and your personal preferences. Today, it's taking that one step further with Discover Weekly, a personalized playlist for each Spotify user that gets updated on a weekly basis. Discover Weekly is based on music you like and what other people like you like Spotify says the Discover Weekly playlist is built based on the music that you listen to in addition to what other, similar users have been listening to. It's designed to surface the lesser-known tracks and deep cuts, as opposed to just being a playlist of the most popular songs out right now. It's available at the top of each user's Playlist folder.  I had a chance to check out the Discover Weekly playlist ahead of launch. It served up 30 tracks totaling almost two and a half hours of music that ranged from dad rock, to sad rock, to hipper chillwave tracks. Some of the artists were ones that I'm closely familiar with, while others were complete unknowns to me. But all of the songs were new to me, either completely so or different versions of songs I'd heard before. From my experience, Discover Weekly fulfilled its mission of delivering songs I hadn't heard before, but would likely enjoy.   I'm a fairly heavy user of streaming music services, listening to Spotify anywhere from four to 10 hours a day, so there's plenty of material for Spotify to build a custom playlist from. Other, more casual users might not have the same experience. And I've only heard one playlist from Discover Weekly thus far — subsequent ones might not hit the mark as well. Spotify says that it will take a few weeks to a month for it to compile a Discover Weekly playlist for new users, and it will change based on a user's listening habits. It will be updated every Monday morning, ideally in time for the commute to work. Discover Weekly playlists can be shared like any other in Spotify, and other users can even subscribe to your Discover Weekly list if they so wish. It may not be quite as extensive as Apple Music's For You section, but Discover Weekly should serve as a good place to find those deep cuts and hidden gems you might not otherwise hear.",0.8828616711320297,0.11713832886797027,0.16272311027482347,473,4.6976744186046515,259,5.4324324324324325,1,2,Tech,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Apple and Google take a breather after their massive developer conferences, consumers are out on vacation, and the drumbeat of the fall’s big events pounds only softly in the cloudy distance. But not this year. It’s not just that Apple earnings are tomorrow — hopefully with some hints as to how well the Apple Watch is doing (but don’t hold your breath for any firm numbers). It’s also not just that Samsung up and decided to drop a new premium Android tablet in the dead of night on an unsuspecting world. It’s much more, and next week is going to be nuts. Witness: Microsoft will have the biggest news next week, though, with the launch of Windows 10. It’s happening on July 29th, but we’re going to let it sneak in for Wednesday the 28th in our tally (thanks time zones!). The launch is going to be different from what most operating system launches look like: it’s a release day, but it will also take some time for most people to upgrade. More importantly, don’t think of it just as a static launch: Microsoft is serious about this being the ""last"" version of Windows, so July 29th will mainly be the day when Microsoft starts pushing out updates so often that Windows will be less like a static OS and more like an ever-evolving service. I won’t go over all the reasons that Windows 10 is going to be a watershed moment in tech, but here are a few.  Windows 10 looks really good Windows 10 is going to be a free upgrade for just about everybody, a strong sign that Microsoft really wants this to become the de facto computing platform for desktops and laptops. And mobile, too, though its plans in that regard are nascent — to put it charitably. Microsoft likes to say that there are 1.5 billion people who could upgrade to Win10, and numbers like that should make you pay attention.   But more than anything else, Windows 10 looks really good. We’ll save most of our thoughts for our wall-to-wall coverage next week (Windows-to-Windows? Sorry, had to. But seriously, buckle up). The early looks that have been available to over 5 million Windows Insiders have been impressive. There are still bugs to quash in even the most recent build, but the bottom line is that Microsoft has learned from the bad bets it made with Windows 8 and is fixing all of them. Most importantly, this seems to be the first desktop operating system that actually feels like it belongs in a mobile-first world. There’s the Cortana personal assistant, ""universal"" apps that work on both desktop and (someday) mobile, and a web browser that will hopefully be as fast and modern as Microsoft promises.   Motorola will launch at least two new phones in a live press event in New York City on July 28th. A new Moto X and an update to the Moto G are expected — and it’s possible we could see more on top of that (including new Droid variants for Verizon). Motorola’s teaser says that ""your relationship status is about to change,"" which is unfortunately about as vague as teasers get. Hello Moto, again But we’ve already seen some leaks out of Hong Kong, namely the backplates for the Moto G, Moto X, and a couple Droid phones. They show that Motorola, now under Lenovo’s management, is sticking to the design language it created with the original Moto X. The Moto G in particular should also graduate from ""low-end phone that everybody secretly loves"" to ""solid upper-mid-range phone that can be customized a million ways from Sunday via Moto Maker."" Such is the march of progress and razor-thin slicing of how the Android market works. Not to be left behind, OnePlus is also due to announce its followup to last year’s surprisingly successful OnePlus One. The supposed OnePlus Two, which should launch on the 27th, is said to have a host of high-end features, such as a Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 processor, 4GB of RAM, and a USB Type-C port. Like last year’s OnePlus One, the Two is expected to be priced well below other flagships, essentially at cost. Hopefully this time around, the company is able to sort out its issues actually selling the product and interested customers won’t have to jump through hoops to snag an invite to buy one. Also interesting, OnePlus says it will officially announce the phone through a virtual reality press conference, displayed on Google Cardboard VR units. Will that be enough to make OnePlus stand out in the maelstrom of news that week? Not if the next company has anything to say about it.  Nokia has a surprise in store There’s one more thing coming next Wednesday, something nobody really expected. Nokia is holding some sort of mysterious ""VIP"" event in Los Angeles. The tagline on in the invitation has some wordplay: ""NOWHERE"" and ""NOW HERE."" Speculation on what Nokia’s doing is pretty unformed so far, and to be blunt, many of the products you’d traditionally expect seem unlikely. It won’t be a phone, we’re sure, and though the company could do something with Here maps (note the wordplay), that seems a little small for a ""VIP event hosted by Nokia Technologies."" So take a breath, a deep one, and then carb up. You’re going to need the energy. Next week is going to have a lot of tech news, and we’ll be covering it all, wall to wall, Windows to Windows.",0.5074285010445618,0.49257149895543817,0.163809741564685,943,4.6977730646871683,497,5.7987927565392354,0,6,"Google, Microsoft, Tech",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Earlier this week at a conference in Cleveland, Ohio, scientists with NASA's Eagleworks Laboratories in Houston, Texas, presented a paper indicating they had achieved a small amount of thrust from a container that had no traditional fuels, only microwaves, bouncing around inside it. If the results can be replicated reliably and scaled up — and that's a big ""if,"" since NASA only produced them on a very small scale over a two-day period — they could ultimately result in ultra-light weight, ultra fast spacecraft that could carry humans to Mars in weeks instead of months, and to the nearest star system outside our own (Proxima Centurai) in just about 30 years. The type of container NASA tested was based on a model for a new space engine that doesn't use weighty liquid propellant or nuclear reactors, called a Cannae Drive. The idea is that microwaves bouncing from end-to-end of a specially designed, unevenly-shaped container can create a difference in radiation pressure, causing thrust to be exerted toward the larger end of the container. A similar type of technology called an EmDrive has been demonstrated to work in small scale trials by Chinese and Argentine scientists.  While the amount of thrust generated in these NASA's tests was lower than previous trials — between 30 and 50 micronewtons, way less than even the weight of an iPhone, as Nova points out — the fact that any thrust whatsoever is generated without an onboard source of fuel seems to violate the conservation of momentum, a bedrock in the laws of physics. ""not attributable to any classical electromagnetic phenomenon."" Most impressively, the NASA team specifically built two Cannae Drives, including one that was designed to fail, and instead it worked. As the scientists write in their paper abstract: ""thrust was observed on both test articles, even though one of the test articles was designed with the expectation that it would not produce thrust."" That suggests the drive is ""producing a force that is not attributable to any classical electromagnetic phenomenon,"" the scientists write. It may instead be interacting with the quantum vacuum — the lowest energetic state possible — but the scientists don't have much evidence to support this idea yet. There are many reasons to be skeptical: the inventor of the Cannae Drive, Guido Fetta, has only a Bachelor’s Degree in Chemical Engineering and is operating his company Cannae as a for-profit venture. Still, the fact that such results were produced by NASA scientists is promising and should warrant further investigation.",0.320264555253202,0.679735444746798,0.5894778393301195,469,5.0874200426439229,278,6.1258992805755392,0,0,Science,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

At least two Americans have now been infected with the disease: Dr. Kent Brantly of Texas and Nancy Writebol of North Carolina, who both worked in an ebola clinic in Monrovia, Liberia. That's also where they're being treated, with no plans to evacuate them to more developed countries. It's awful to think that Americans might be airlifted to better hospitals while locals suffer and die in one of the poorest countries in the world, but it wouldn't be unheard of. A doctor working for the World Health Organization (WHO) who contracted ebola may soon be taken to Hamburg, Germany at the organization’s request. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which has been active in the ebola crisis, says there is no established protocol for evacuating American aid workers. ""Whether an American citizen would be transported to another country would be determined on a case by case basis, and it’s something we’re working now on figuring out now,"" spokesperson Kristen Nordlund tells The Verge. There is no established protocol for evacuating American aid workers Ebola, which is spread through contact with bodily fluids, has no cure and typically kills between 50 percent and 90 percent of its victims. The body suffers symptoms including fever, vomiting, diarrhea, and bleeding from the orifices, until multiple organ failure causes death. Because the disease is so contagious, many victims die in isolation. The current outbreak has a mortality rate of 55 percent. ""There is currently no specific treatment to cure the disease,"" says Nordlund. ""Some patients will recover with the appropriate medical care, though more research needs to be done to know why some people survive and others don’t."" Doctors concentrate on ""supportive therapy,"" or keeping the patient hydrated, ensuring they receive proper nutrition, monitoring blood pressure, and curing any secondary infections. This protocol ""can be done anywhere,"" says Gregory Hartl, a spokesperson for the WHO. At the same time, resources do make a difference. ""These three countries in West Africa are among the poorest in the world, so they have very few resources,"" he says.  ""They don't have much equipment, they don't have much material."" Liberia's health system is especially broken due to more than a decade of political instability, and is highly dependent on support from aid organizations to deliver basic services. Health experts agree that intensive care after infection with ebola is critical to beating the disease, and richer countries are better equipped to provide that than poorer ones. If you have ebola, you're better off in a Western hospital than a West African one ""There is a significant disparity in access to healthcare and quality of healthcare between an under-resourced country and a resource-rich country, especially with respect to intensive supportive care and clinical monitoring capacity,"" says Dr. William Fischer, who treated ebola patients in Guinea last month. Patients infected with Marburg, a virus similar to ebola, experienced a lower mortality rate when cared for in Germany as opposed to Angola, Kenya or Uganda, he says. So if you’ve got ebola, you’re probably better off in a Western hospital than a West African one. However, there are also practical challenges to repatriating Americans who get sick. A mobile contagious patient raises fears of spreading the epidemic across continents. The patient also may not be strong enough to travel. The ebola outbreak shows no signs of slowing down, with new cases reported every few days. The CDC says 42 days, or two incubation periods (the maximum time between contracting the disease and showing symptoms) with no new cases must pass before the outbreak can be considered over. Even then, the disease may return. ""This is a rapidly changing situation,"" Dr. Steve Monroe, deputy director at the CDC’s National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases said on a call with reporters today.

They use sight, smell, and even feel to tell each other apart. But in certain cases, the similarities between species are just too strong, so internal processes, such as a female’s ability to detect sperm from another species and select those that belong to her own, have to pick up the slack. This is what tends to happen with Caenorhabditis worms, a type of roundworm. Unfortunately, this doesn’t always work — sometimes the sperm cells are just too quick, and things can go terribly wrong. ""What we found was that female gonads can instead get overrun by sperm from foreign males, leading to their permanent sterility,"" and sometimes death, said Asher Cutter, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Toronto, in an email to The Verge. ""female gonads can instead get overrun by sperm from foreign males."" Cutter is part of a team of researchers that published a study in PLOS Biology today describing how they went from observing the mechanism that Caenorhabditis worms use to prevent mixing genes with different species — often using mismatched reproductive cells and organs — to observing females of the Caenorhabditis briggsae species being ""overrun by sperm."" ""We were fascinated by the idea that 'mating with the wrong species' in many organisms often does not have much long-term consequence, in that there is often no exchange of genes between the species,"" Cutter said. So, ""we started out trying to make genetic hybrids between species."" One of the things they did was mate C. briggsae females — this species is mostly made up of females that fertilize themselves using sperm they’ve produced on their own, so the researchers refer to them as ""hermaphrodites"" — with males of a different species called C. nigoni. These two species are very closely related, so they can actually produce viable and fertile offspring. But as the researchers observed for the first time, when this pairing does produce eggs, there are far fewer offspring than would normally be the case. ""Instead of the 300 or so offspring they would normally make, they would make 10 or 20,"" Cutter said. ""This was very unexpected."" To understand what was actually happening inside these translucent worms, the researchers used fluorescent dye and watched the sperm migrate inside the worms’ bodies after mating. ""This showed us that the sperm derived from males of the 'wrong species' often migrated into inappropriate parts of the bodies of their mates,"" Cutter said, ""sometimes leaving the reproductive organs entirely."" The sperm invasion also ""induced early death."" This phenomenon — which the researchers called a ""sperm invasion"" dynamic — was ""quite shocking,"" Cutter said, because in extreme cases, the overwhelming quantity of sperm migrated around the entire body cavity, instead of just around the reproductive organs. ""This led to sterility of the hermaphrodites that males had mated with,"" he said, ""and also induced early death."" And when the hermaphrodites did manage to produce hybrid embryos, they were ""not laid through the vulva,"" the researchers write, and got stuck in the oviduct instead. ""This is one of several ways in which nigoni sperm sterilize briggsae hermaphrodites,"" said Eric Haag, a biologist at the University of Maryland and the co-author of the study, in an email. Yet mating the C. briggsae males, which are rare, with the non-hermaphroditic C. nigoni females didn’t cause the females to die early. It still led to sterilization, however, when the females mated with these males more than once.  ""Despite being a bit grotesque, an intriguing feature of [the hermaphrodites'] serious problem of having mated to males of another species is that it still precludes exchange of genes between the species,"" Cutter said, much like when females ignore foreign sperm during fertilization. So, one can still look at this and think of it as a successful — albeit rather drastic — iteration of an inter-species breeding avoidance mechanism. Because this phenomenon hasn’t been described before, the researchers call it ""unprecedented"" in the paper. But some aspects of these observations aren’t altogether novel, given that there are other animal species where sperm cells move through the body cavity before fertilizing egg cells. This happens in flatworms and bed bugs, for instance. But usually this migration is a precursor to fertilization, which means it doesn’t cause infertility or death. Hybrid embryos weren't laid through the vulva. They got stuck inside instead. ""We don't yet know what allows sperm to migrate beyond the spermatheca,"" Cutter said, referencing the female organ where fertilization takes place. Under normal circumstances, having sperm that can migrate quickly up the reproductive tract is advantageous for males who compete with other males for the best spot for their sperm inside the spermatheca. But in this case, the signals that keep the sperm inside the organ appear to have gone haywire. ""It could be that the seminal fluid contains a compound that the sperm cells release"" and that causes the oviduct muscles to relax, Cutter said. As a result, the sperm would be able to crawl up the body cavity (the use of the word ""crawl"" is important because these sperm are amoeboid, meaning that they use protrusions of the cell body to push themselves forward, instead of ""swimming"" with a tail). Yet another possibility is that there could be some sort of short-circuiting of signals involving the prostaglandin mixture, a chemical cue that usually serves to attract sperm to the site of fertilization. ""hermaphrodites are especially vulnerable because they rarely mate."" But even after researchers figure this out, a number of questions will remain. For example, the scientists don’t know how widespread this phenomenon is, or what biological features make female reproductive organs more resistant to invasive sperm. ""We believe hermaphrodites are especially vulnerable because they rarely mate, and when they do it is generally with a single male,"" Haag said. This means that male competition is ""more or less non-existent,"" he said, and over time their bodies and their sperm evolved to become more benign. That might have caused hermaphrodites to biologically ""let their guard down"" over evolutionary time. ""This works fine as long as they only mate with their own males,"" Hagg said, ""but clearly problems arise when they mate with males from outcrossing species."" And, of course, there's still the question of what the sperm are doing to kill C. briggsae hermaphrodites. ""We imagine that to get out of the gonad, [the sperm] must puncture the membrane that surrounds it,"" Haag said. ""This would cause leakage of material from one compartment to another, and this could directly hurt them."" Another possibility, he said, is that the sperm damage delicate body structures outside of the gonad, like neurons. ""We do see them all the way up in the head area, where most neurons are."" But for now, Cutter said, ""the biochemistry and genetic details controlling these mismatches are still a black box to us.""",0.5008421698878405,0.49915783011215953,0.8279535263014991,1168,5.209760273972603,558,6.3835125448028673,0,0,"Science, Report",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Ian Garrick-Bethell, who authored the study published in Nature, describes it as ""like a lemon with an equatorial bulge,"" or like a water balloon that flattens out as it's spun. But why, given that it spins much slower on its axis than the Earth and has none of our planet's plate tectonics, is the moon not a perfect sphere? Garrick-Bethell and his team instead ascribed the shape to a process known as tidal heating, in which early orbital forces between the Earth and the moon caused friction in the latter's interior, causing its crust to expand outward in certain places. As the planetoid moved further away from our planet and slowed down its rotation, one such tidal surge was frozen in place, explaining the modern moon's strange bulge. Garrick-Bethell, a planetary scientist at the University of California, Santa Cruz, used a laser altimeter to create super-accurate maps of the moon's surface, before calculating its topography. The method meant the team behind the study were the first to get a clear picture of the moon's real shape — other scientists who have attempted the same in the past have been foiled by the sheer number of craters pockmarking the planetoid's exterior and concealing its topographical lumps and bumps.",0.8278718245739884,0.17212817542601155,0.6723640378112283,293,4.9590443686006829,192,5.84375,0,0,Science,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

And these challenges are extraordinary,"" WHO Director General Margaret Chan told leaders of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone in a speech in Guinea's capital city Conakry. ""This outbreak is moving faster than our efforts to control it. If the situation continues to deteriorate, the consequences can be catastrophic in terms of lost lives but also severe socioeconomic disruption and a high risk of spread to other countries,"" she warned. ""The consequences can be catastrophic. According to the WHO's latest tally, the virus has infected 1,323 and led to 729 deaths across Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, and Sierra Leone. Most of those cases have been in Sierra Leone, while the most deaths — 339 — have been recorded in Guinea. This particular outbreak has wrecked havoc in the region, and been unlike many previous outbreaks of the virus, which occurred in more isolated areas. Its presence in densely-populated cities has created a more volatile situation where the virus can be spread more easily and become more difficult to contain by international health efforts. Helping that spread has been what Chan referred to as a lack of public awareness. In her speech, she warned of ""invisible"" chains of transmission, people who forgo isolation wards and medical help in favor of receiving care at home from family members where it can be spread to others. ""Such hiding of cases defeats strategies for rapid containment,"" Chan said. ""Dignified burial makes an essential contribution to public trust and eases family grieving, but this must be done safely. Traditional funeral practices are a well-documented spark that ignites further chains of transmission."" This is the most lethal strain of ebola Ebola is a deadly virus that was first identified in 1976, and has up to a 90 percent mortality rate among those who are infected, though has been about 60 percent in this latest outbreak. Chan noted that the strain affecting the region is the most lethal in the family of ebola viruses. The virus is spread between humans through body fluids, and there's no cure or vaccine available. Those who are infected can have fever, muscle pain, and a headache before the virus causes vomiting, diarrhea, and internal and external bleeding, eventually leading to death. ""Apart from this specific situation, the general public is not at high risk of infection by the ebola virus,"" Chan said, but warned that simply overlocking the situation would be unwise.

Another snorted as he walked by, reading the signs on the machine and saying, ""‘Buy Bitcoin, sell Bitcoin.’ There should be a button that says ‘hack Bitcoin.’"" The virtual currency has been trading at between $600 and $700 apiece at the time of this writing, despite a flurry of bad publicity in the past few weeks.  A reporter for Newsweek claims to have unmasked the creator of Bitcoin, revealing a humble Japanese man living in California. The proof is far from conclusive, but the story stirred up new debate about Bitcoin’s viability and took some of the sexiness out of its creation myth. The week before, the largest Bitcoin exchange announced it’s filing for bankruptcy after losing $400 million worth of coins, possibly due to theft from hackers. Last month, a prominent Bitcoin entrepreneur was arrested for money laundering. ""There should be a button that says ‘hack Bitcoin.’"" Piri, who runs a company called Bitcoin Agents with his brother Reza, believes the machines will make him money. He discovered he could make money off Bitcoin when he noticed a $100 discrepancy in price between two websites and arbitraged it. The ATMs will make Bitcoin more popular, he says, by making it easier to use and adding liquidity to the currency. ""Five years from now, I see a use for [Bitcoin ATMs] in third world countries. Here in the United States, they’ll be ubiquitous. I think there will be a few hundred. We just have to bring them mainstream,"" he says. ""When you introduce people to Bitcoin, it’s a very hard idea because it’s not clear, even in regulators’ minds.

Unlike other automakers, Tesla sells its Model S through company-owned retail stores — a business model that cuts out the franchised auto dealerships that have ruled the market for decades. New Jersey is the third US state to ban car manufacturers from selling directly to customers, joining Texas and Arizona. But unlike those two states, New Jersey is home to a booming luxury vehicle market, making this a major loss for Tesla. As you might guess, Tesla is outraged by the decision. In a blog post, the company blasted Governor Chris Christie's administration for deceitful tactics. Tesla claims that Christie previously agreed to delay the proposed amendment, which would have allowed ""a fair process"" in the state legislature. But yesterday — just 24 hours before the amendment was hurriedly passed — Tesla says it abruptly received word that Christie's administration ""had gone back on its word."" Tesla says the amendment ""is an affront to the very concept of a free market."" And the company insists this isn't just about cutting out the middleman; Tesla says full control over the buying experience is necessary to properly educate car buyers about the benefits that come with going electric. We strongly believe it is vital to introduce our own vehicles to the market because electric cars are still a relatively new technology. This model is not just a matter of selling more cars and providing optimum consumer choice for Americans, but it is also about educating consumers about the benefits of going electric, which is central to our mission to accelerate the shift to sustainable transportation, a new paradigm in automotive technology.

The group has paid particular attention to airlines, manufacturers, and defense contractors. In some cases, the group gained access to security control systems at airport gates, potentially allowing for forged gate credentials that would circumvent airport security. They also gained access to PayPal credentials and industrial control systems from other targets. Attackers smuggled out files in emails touting discount Viagra The group's methods are effective but not particularly novel, relying entirely on known vulnerabilities and phishing attacks. SQL injection often gave the group its first foothold in a system, although the attackers also sent targets phony job offers from defense contractors like Teledyne and Northrop Grumman. Once the first target was infected, they set to work accessing more powerful credentials, compiling master password lists, and smuggling them out to the master servers. Password files usually went to an anonymous FTP server hosted in California, but in one particularly clever example, the attackers smuggled out the files in emails touting discount Viagra, using the language of spam to ensure no one would look twice at the attachments. It's a remarkable footprint for a program that has often been overlooked in favor of better-funded groups in Russia and China. In February, The Wall Street Journal reported an Iranian attack targeting US Navy networks, signaling that the country was beginning to retaliate after years as the target of sophisticated military malware.

The man, Soheil Arabi, was convicted in a Tehran criminal court in August after admitting to posting the defamatory content. His lawyers argued that he had done so while ""in poor psychological condition,"" according to the International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran, and that he was merely sharing views held by others. But Iran's Supreme Court upheld the conviction late last month and went a step further by adding a charge of ""sowing corruption of Earth."" This charge is also punishable by death and cannot be pardoned, according to Arabi's lawyer. ""Currently, there is no pardon."" Human Rights Watch this week called on the Iranian government to halt Arabi's death sentence, but government officials have shown no sign of leniency. ""Currently, there is no pardon, and he’s been convicted of 'corruption on Earth,'"" Gholam Ali Mohseni Ejei, deputy head of Iran's judiciary, told reporters Monday. ""But there has been a request for his case to be reviewed again."" Iran has long taken a hard stance on online dissent, and appears to have stepped up its efforts in recent months. According to Reporters Without Borders, at least 65 activists, journalists, and bloggers were currently in prison because of their online activities as of July. In May, seven people were arrested for dancing to the Pharrell Williams song ""Happy"" and publishing the video online. They were given a suspended sentence of one year in jail and 91 lashes, on the basis that the video violated Iran's Islamic laws. In July, eight Iranians were arrested and sentenced to a combined 127 years in jail on charges of colluding against the state and spreading propaganda on Facebook.  At the same time, President Hassan Rouhani has publicly called for a relaxation of Iran's strict internet censorship regime, including its restrictions on social media. This has put Rouhani at apparent odds with the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has stood by the restrictions despite his prolific Twitter activity. Nastaran Naimi, Arabi's wife, claims her husband was forced to admit guilt under pressure from agents of Iran's Revolutionary Guard. Both she and her husband were arrested in their homes in November 2013, and while Naimi was soon released, Arabi was held in solitary confinement for two months. In a separate case related to the same Facebook posts, he was sentenced to three years in prison on September 4th for ""spreading propaganda against the system"" and ""insulting the leader."" One of the Facebook pages he operated was titled ""The generation that no longer wants to be the burned generation."" According to Amnesty International, Arabi's conviction marks the second time that an Iranian has been sentenced to death for insulting the Prophet Mohammed. In August, an engineer named Rouhollah Tavana was sentenced to death after allegedly insulting the prophet in a video clip. Amnesty, like Human Rights Watch, has called upon the government to halt Arabi's hanging and release him immediately. ""It is simply shocking that anyone should face the gallows simply because of Internet postings that are deemed to be crude, offensive, or insulting,"" Eric Goldstein, deputy Middle East and North Africa director at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement this week.

In a conference reported by The New York Times, Mayor Bill de Blasio said that selected officers could be wearing the small but fairly visible cameras as soon as Friday, and the NYPD confirmed that 50 will be running by this weekend. ""When something happens, to have a video record of it, from the police officers' perspective, is going to help in many, many ways,"" said de Blasio. ""And God forbid, when something goes wrong, we are going to have a clearer sense of what happened."" The NYPD was ordered to test body cameras last year as part of a harsh ruling against its widely criticized stop-and-frisk program, which a judge found disproportionately and unfairly targeted people of color. Police Commissioner Bill Bratton then announced a pilot program in September of 2014, after the shooting of black teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri launched a debate about police accountability and racism. After a three-month trial period, the NYPD hopes to expand the program to more of its roughly 35,000 officers, joining a growing number of police departments that are adopting body cameras as an accountability and evidence-gathering tool. In the wake of Brown's death, his family has pushed for widespread adoption of police cameras, which could have led to the indictment of Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson. But in New York, the news came shortly before a grand jury dismissed charges in the clearly videotaped killing of Eric Garner by NYPD officers. ""I'm very excited personally."" ""I'm very excited personally,"" said Bratton in an interview with CBS today. ""I'm a great supporter of technology in policing. I think it will eliminate an awful lot of the 'he said, she said' situations, where we don't have video."" While they're far from ubiquitous, the cameras have gained popularity in recent years: the NYPD will be following the lead of London; Washington, DC; and Ferguson itself, among others. On Monday, President Barack Obama announced his support of body cameras, promising to spend $75 million over three years supporting police departments that adopted them. The program is supposed to fund the purchase of 50,000 cameras; by comparison, the two leading producers of police cameras say they've sold a total of about 70,000 to date. The NYPD's pilot was launched with $60,000 in funds with the nonprofit New York City Police Foundation, and Obama's plan could put similar programs within the reach of other police departments. ""I think it's an incredible incentive,"" said Jim Bueermann, the president of the (unrelated) Police Foundation, a law enforcement-focused think tank based in Washington, DC. Individual cameras can cost a few hundred dollars apiece, but they have to be paired with a secure method of storing video, whether that's an in-house system or an online service like Taser's Evidence.com. NYPD officials hope that the devices could pay for themselves by reducing complaints and claims payouts. Theoretically, this could happen either because cameras put police officers on their best behavior, or because they'll be able to use video evidence to defend themselves when accused of misconduct. There's not yet enough evidence to support this hope, but a 2012 experiment in the Rialto, California police department was promising. Researchers found that police with cameras used force roughly half as often as those with them, and the department as a whole saw a 60 percent reduction in force and an 88 percent reduction in complaints compared to the previous year. A later test in Mesa, Arizona also found a drop in complaints, and a report by the Police Executive Research Foundation found considerable support among members of law enforcement. New York's last mayor thought body cameras were ""a nightmare"" There has, however, been opposition. Police unions in Miami have fought plans to test body cameras; one complaint argued that having to turn on recording before an arrest or traffic stop would distract officers, while another said one pilot program's lack of rules made it ""reckless"" and a ""free for all."" Former NYC mayor Michael Bloomberg came out firmly against them last year. ""It would be a nightmare,"" he said after the stop-and-frisk ruling. ""We can't have your cameraman follow you around and film things without people questioning whether they deliberately chose an angle, whether they got the whole picture in."" Civil liberties advocates have been similarly conflicted, but for different reasons. The ACLU is generally in favor of police body cameras, but it's adamant that the program will only work if police aren't allowed to selectively choose what to record, and if the resulting videos can't be altered or leaked to the public. Senior analyst Jay Stanley sees Obama's support as a chance to shape good policy. ""I would like to see the federal government use its powers, including its power of the purse, to encourage police departments to wrap the introduction of this technology in strong policies,"" he says. ""There are a lot of ways that this technology could fail at [the] goal of building trust."" It's not clear exactly how the NYPD will handle asking officers to record their interactions. And, unfortunately, it's all too clear that cameras can only do so much to prevent police violence. There was little question of how Garner, who was killed a few weeks before Brown, died — he was restrained by police and choked after being stopped for selling loose cigarettes. But juries declined to indict the officers involved in either case. More recently, there's clear video of Cleveland police shooting black 12-year-old Tamir Rice, who was killed for carrying a pellet gun designed to look like a real weapon. And in other cases, police are learning how to deal with the fact that it's all too easy for an officer to defeat the cameras, by accident or intention: they can just never turn them on in the first place.",0.49966690966829985,0.5003330903317001,0.8454234082910529,986,5.093306288032454,541,6.2033271719038821,0,0,US & World,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

The Wall Street Journal is reporting that researchers investigating the hack have found the malicious code to be almost exactly the same as the code used in a March 2013 attack on a series of South Korean banks and broadcasters, an attack widely believed to have been conducted by North Korea. Re/code had previously reported that Sony was investigating a North Korean connection, but this new analysis is the most definitive evidence unearthed so far. ""We won't give up this attack unless Sony Pictures collapse to the end."" North Korea has been intensely critical of Sony Pictures' upcoming film The Interview, a comedy that follows a plot to assassinate the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. Sony has already edited out some of the film's more controversial points, including a scene in which Kim Jong-un's face melts off in slow motion in a tribute to Raiders of the Lost Ark. North Korean officials responded to news of the film by saying, ""a film about the assassination of a foreign leader mirrors what the US has done in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and Ukraine."" Recent statements from the hacking group behind the attacks seem to echo that statement. Because of the group's penchant for communicating through open, unprotected email accounts, it is difficult to verify any message as definitively coming from the group, but one recent message sent to The Verge singled out The Interview as a dangerous and irresponsible move by the studio. Sent from a password-protected email associated with the group, the message read: The concern over regional security and cryptic references to human rights violations mirror earlier North Korean statements, as well as a generally fatalistic message. A later portion of the message reads: ""We won't give up this attack unless Sony Pictures collapse to the end."" If the North Korean connection bears out, it would be an extremely unusual development: the first time a Hollywood studio has come under attack from a foreign power. It would also be the first time a foreign power has taken an active interest in piracy, leaking several of Sony's films onto torrent sites. It's too early to say for sure: so far, all the North Korea connections are circumstantial. But even if the culprits are run-of-the-mill criminals, it's already one of the most unusual attacks we've seen in years.

The money includes $75 million allocated specifically for the purchase of 50,000 cameras for law enforcement officers across the country. The training portion of the funds would go toward instructing police in the responsible use of paramilitary equipment like assault rifles and armored personnel carriers, much of which has flooded local departments as a result of a Homeland Security preparedness program. Additional funds will go to fund police outreach programs designed to build trust between local departments and the communities they serve. $263 million in new federal funding The cameras are designed to provide a definitive record of police activities, and have become a frequent demand in the wake of the Ferguson protests. The protests began with the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed teenager killed by the police in Ferguson. Community leaders pointed to video taken in the aftermath of Brown's death as evidence of police misconduct, and the subsequent outcry has triggered a Justice Department investigation. More recently, a widely shared video of Cleveland police shooting a 12-year-old named Tamir Rice has intensified the demand for video documentation of police activities. Last week, the parents of Michael Brown announced a campaign ""to ensure that every police officer working the streets in this country wears a body camera."" The new funding push is substantial, but 50,000 cameras will cover only a fraction of the more than 750,000 police officers currently employed in America. Camera proposals have also run into trouble with public records laws in states like Washington, which require the release of all police records not actively tied up in an investigation. With hundreds of hours of video generated by police cameras every day, that would present serious problems for both privacy and simple logistics. Still, many police departments have already looked into body-mounted cameras. On October 1st, the Washington D.C. police began a six-month pilot program that put cameras on the shoulders of many local police, and officials expect the program to reduce the number of complaints filed against officers by as much as 80 percent. The program wasn't cheap: it cost $1 million to buy and store the necessary volume of cameras. But after today, other departments that decide to take the same leap will have federal matching funds to soften the blow.

The studio is still holding off on its official announcement, but by now it seems clear that the attack came in retaliation for the upcoming film The Interview, a comedy about an attempt to kill North Korean leader Kim Jong-un.  North Korean officials had denounced the film as an act of war, and with the attack public, North Korean leaders have yet to deny the country is responsible. It's the first time a foreign nation has targeted a Hollywood studio, and despite North Korea's numerous threats, it's not something anyone expected. But while Sony recovers, the attack has already raised larger questions about civilian vulnerability to cyberattacks, and how much damage a rogue state with a grudge can really do. The data dump contained enough passwords to compromise the system The biggest question so far is simply how the attackers got their first foothold. The initial list of leaked files contained everything from sensitive financial documents to downloaded podcasts, suggesting it was pulled en masse from a company server. We don't know how that server was compromised yet, but phishing attacks and delayed fallout from a recent PlayStation attack are high on the list. Luckily for the North Koreans, the dump seems to have contained enough password files to get them full access to the system. From there, they caused as much trouble as possible. The entire corporate system locked up, showing a red skeleton that announced as bluntly as possible, ""You've been hacked by #GOP."" Hard drives were wiped, email accounts froze and employees were cautioned not to connect to the office Wi-Fi. Sony Pictures employees were forced to do business on landlines and fax machines, according to The LA Times. Attackers have released more sensitive data through torrents, Mega and Rapidgator Sony is working with Mandiant and the FBI to clean up the damage, but the larger concern is the bulk of data that's leaked onto the web. Five of the studio's films have already leaked onto torrent sites (four of which have not yet premiered in theaters), and in the days since the hack, the attackers have released more sensitive data through torrents and sharing services like Mega and Rapidgator, playing whack-a-mole with the feds who are trying to keep the information contained. Each time a torrent link is taken down, the attackers email a new link to journalists, many of whom have been happy to run with the scoop. But while Sony struggles to regain control of its data, the attackers seem more interested in spreading chaos than causing lasting damage. Lots of sensitive financial information was shared in the file dump, but it's unlikely any of it will be used for identity theft simply because it was made available so publicly, attracting the attention of the FBI at a very early stage. Other data, like employee salaries and scripts in development, seem more likely to cause PR damage than lasting financial harm. That's not to say Sony isn't suffering. This has certainly been an intense week for the studio and anyone who works there, and it remains to be seen how much the early torrent leaks will cost the company at the box office. But unlike recent breaches at Home Depot and various government agencies, the purpose of this attack wasn't to steal money or extract compromising information. At every stage, the attackers' goal was to make life miserable for Sony Pictures employees, causing as much noise as possible along the way. If they made the attack noisy enough and scary enough, we might listen the next time North Korea rattles its sabers and back off. It's not a particularly noble or intricate plan, but judging by the headlines, it seems to be working.",0.3651435390592991,0.6348564609407009,0.8404173778889529,632,4.943037974683544,358,5.972067039106145,0,0,"US & World, National Security",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

Certainly, students of classical music or jazz or the Civil Rights era will see her name immortalized in history books. But if you try to find her through hip-hop, you’ll see how her legacy has touched generations. And no one has upheld that legacy quite like Lauryn Hill. For context’s sake, Netflix showed its latest documentary What Happened, Miss Simone?, which hits the streaming service on June 26th, at the Apollo Theater in Harlem on Monday. It was a fitting venue; Simone last performed there in 1969, and the building is precious in a way that reflects Nina’s importance to Black America. The film itself was a focused, unflinching look at the singer’s life, from her rise as America’s ""High Priestess of Soul,"" to her fall from grace and even mental stability, to her triumphant return to form. It’s a work of art. What director Liz Garbus accomplished is heartbreaking and powerful, a portrait of a difficult genius (and when are our American geniuses ever not difficult?) struggling against her time and herself while making art out of the conflict.  But I wasn’t there to review the film. I was there for Lauryn Hill, the ""secret"" closing act of the night. Now, Nina Simone’s importance to the culture is undeniable, but the truth is I’ve been listening to Lauryn longer. I’d first heard Nina’s name in that classic line on ""Ready or Not"": So while you’re imitating Al Capone / I’ll be Nina Simone / And defecating on your microphone For me, the connection on that night was obvious. Both women made indelible marks on music through craft, poetry, and a willingness to speak against social injustice. Both women struggled with love, money, and fame. So I suppose I went expecting nothing less than the musical equivalent of a seance; that Lauryn would meet Nina’s spirit onstage and we’d all be changed by their combined presence. I expected the musical equivalent of a seance That spirit was never wholly summoned. The show was imperfect. Lauryn’s voice was hoarse from rushing to record an upcoming but unannounced tribute album, Nina Revisited… A Tribute to Nina Simone (which features the likes of Usher, Jazmine Sullivan, and Mary J. Blige). Sound issues rendered whole sections of the onstage orchestra inaudible. And when Lauryn started ""Black Is the Colour of My True Love’s Hair,"" there were three false starts due to syncing problems. Like the film we had just watched, it was a stark reminder that performing isn’t easy. When things worked, though, it was easy to get swept away, and you remembered why Nina’s music was so important. Nina Simone, as an artist, was an icon whose music spoke to the unrest of the 1960s. She was a classically trained pianist who rose to international fame and found herself compelled to infuse the plight of black people into her work. Considering the bloodshed and terror now facing blacks in America today and the lasting commitment to protesting injustice, her music is as necessary as ever. All Lauryn Hill had to do was add a present-day spin to Simone’s message. And, despite the technical issues, she succeeded. During her set, Lauryn took ""Ne Me Quitte Pas,"" a French song about holding onto a lost love, and turned it into a prayer for Nina. She took ""Ain’t Got No, I Got Life,"" a song about freedom, and updated it with her own dazzling display of lyricism. (""Lyrics with the safety off / Now dance around these n----- like Baryshnikov."")

The service launches on Sunday, July 12th, and it'll first be available through the Showtime app on the iPhone, iPad, and Apple TV; subscribers can also watch online. Unlike HBO, Showtime isn't giving the service a new name — it's still just Showtime. With its price significantly below the $14.99 per month of HBO Now, Showtime certainly has a compelling argument for choosing its service, although it still has an uphill battle: its series aren't anywhere near as addictive. A 30 day trial will be offered for new customers.  ""Showtime will be much more accessible to tens of millions."" Another major TV channel heading online is great news for those who want to get their favorite shows without subscribing to cable. HBO began offering a similar service, HBO Now, earlier this year, and CBS, which owns Showtime, launched an online subscription last year. Since then, CBS CEO Les Moonves has been very clear about Showtime's intention to follow — the network is well aware that there's money to be made by following consumers' interests rather than playing it safe with cable providers. ""Going over-the-top means Showtime will be much more accessible to tens of millions of potential new subscribers,"" Moonves says in a statement. CBS says that announcements about additional availability of Showtime's online service will be made ""shortly."" It wouldn't be surprising to see it continue to follow in HBO's path, pairing up with internet providers for possible bundles — it essentially allows them to keep the same business model and maintain their standing as a premium product. The launch with Apple also continues to paint Apple as the place to go for cord cutters. Apple has increasingly put a focus on adding new channels to its streaming box, and it seems to have much bigger plans in the works. Already, Moonves has said that CBS will probably sign on board if Apple launches a streaming TV service.",0.6145466290189481,0.3854533709810519,0.22534725484189197,356,4.9775280898876408,222,5.8603603603603602,1,0,"Apps, Culture, Entertainment, Tech",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

But in the Game of Game of Thrones, you only get one point for attendance. And for the past few years, attendance has more or less been what the Walkers have been relegated to: showing up, reminding us they're still on their way, like a lost Uber driver who's been pinging your phone saying he's ""now arriving"" for the past half hour. So I underestimated what a force the White Walkers would actually be this year. And I certainly didn't think that after a couple of rather dour weeks on the show, they would be the ones to get me fully locked back into this season again. ""Hardhome"" felt huge and mythic and significant, up there with Game of Thrones' G.O.A.T. penultimate episodes ""Blackwater"" and ""The Rains of Castemere"" — and we've still got two more hours left in the season! For that, plus the more quantifiable accomplishments of assimilating an entire Wildling fishing village and just being generally terrifying, they are the first player on the board to get a 100-point score in a single night.   But I'm getting ahead of myself, and the episode was filled with plenty of good action before that. We started off in Meereen with Daenerys Targaryen and Tyrion Lannister, chatting it up in the same pyramid throne room. It's still weird, but also feels incredibly rewarding for all the years we've sunk into this show. Tyrion has to earn Dany's trust, which he does by pointing out that he's ""the greatest Lannister killer of all time"" (+5) and by advising her to re-banish the lovesick traitor Jorah Mormont. (-25 to Jorah, who also still has greyscale, and has also decided the best course of action is to return to the fighting pits. This guy!) Pretty sick promotion, Tyrion Tyrion eventually gets hired as Dany's advisor, a pretty sick promotion from the box he started this season in (+25). And hey, let's throw the Mother of Dragons +25 for acquiring such a priceless ally and for finally getting her dramatic moment from the season five trailer (""I'm not going to stop the wheel. I'm going to break it,"" +10). Tyrion was really the one owning the first half of this episode, though, giving voice to everything we've been shouting at Daenerys from our couches the past couple years. There's something fan-servicey about watching these two major characters, both so emblematic of the show itself, sip some of that vintage Myrish firewine (this is my favorite wiki page of the day) and recount their highlight reel of the last few seasons, but I'll take it after the considerably less encouraging adventures they've had this season. Things have changed dramatically for Cersei Lannister as well, who, like Margaery before her, appears to have rapidly deteriorated in her red cell — possibly even faster, as I'm sure Margaery wasn't out there making death threats to the sisters and getting whacked on the head. She gets a visit from Qyburn and a few pieces of important news: she's been essentially kicked off the small council (-25) and is being replaced by beloved voice of reason Kevan Lannister, and her son is too spiritually shattered to visit his own mother in prison. She's also being tried for ""fornication, treason, incest, and the murder of King Robert,"" which, should she need to start a job hunt, would all look great on her résumé under the Skills section. (Qyburn also says something about ""the work continuing,"" which I can only assume means that his abominable FrankenMountain is about to come to life and break Cersei out of jail.) Then Cersei tries to drink water off the floor, which doesn't work very well! (-20)   There's been some internal debate at GOGOT HQ about whether Cersei and Margaery should be awarded points for ""rocking a new look."" It cannot be denied that they look different, and I think part of this falls on me for not adding ""cool"" as a qualifier in that score listing, but the score was originally envisioned as an aesthetic level-up of sorts. You could argue that the fact that a change in their physical appearance means that something interesting has happened to them, thus bringing them closer to ""winning the season."" But for now, the prison duds feel like more of a dead end for both characters than an intriguing new personal development. Also, the new look wasn't voluntary, which is perhaps a more important distinction. Sorry ladies, no points. Arya sells shellfish by the seashore One person who certainly gets a new look score (+10) as well as the incredible outfit score (+15) and hey, the newly established ""acquire oyster cart"" score (+5) is Arya Stark, who is now trying on her first new Face as Lana, a young Braavosi shellfish seller by the seashore. I've watched this bit back twice, and I'm still not entirely sure what the ship gambler, the cheated sailor, and the thin man have to do with the larger plot, if anything at all, but it was nice to see Arya get some fresh air and a temporary side quest that doesn't involve scrubbing down dead bodies. Also, possibly unrelated, this whole sequence just made me want an oyster. Some other stuff happens up north — Samwell Tarly has a nice heart-to-heart with Olly (+5), Ramsay Bolton's plotting some horrible new way to fuck with Stannis, and Sansa Stark gets to work out her rage on Reek (""If I could do to you — right here, right now — what Ramsay did to you, I would."" +10). Sansa also finally learns that she's not the only living Stark left in the world, which may be enough to keep her from sinking into a pit of hopeless depression, so that's nice. (+10)   But after Tyrion and Dany wrapped up their half of the game, the episode was then handed over to the Wildlings, who really took charge of the middle. Much of this could be chalked up to Tormund Giantsbane, tied with the White Walkers this week for a score of 101. This was a career-making week for Tormund, who landed at Hardhome and promptly crushed cosplaying bully The Lord of Bones (+20) and even punctuated it with a cool-guy one-liner (""Gather the elders, and lets talk."" *shades on* +5). Then he and Jon Snow both manage to broker a treaty between the Night's Watch and the Free Folk (+25 each) — a huge power play, especially considering that it took the late Mance Rayder 20 years to unite all the various wildling tribes. RIP to our new fierce lady wildling BFF But the Wildlings were also more exciting because we had a fierce new lady wildling to root for, one that, for a second there, seemed like she could bring back some of the dirty-mouthed charm Ygritte took with her when she ascended to that big sex cave in the sky. (I kept trying to figure out where I knew the actress, Birgitte Hjort Sørensen from, and when I realized it was Pitch Perfect 2 and not the highly respected Danish political drama Borgen, I felt a little dumber.) And perhaps those individualized moments of humanization helped make the wight attack all the more devastating. In the course of a few minutes, Hardhome became more than another spot on the map populated by faceless men decked out in skulls; it was a functional little fishing village with a diverse society, most of the denizens of which really didn't want to get attacked by the armies of the undead. (Least of all our new BFF Karsi, who gets mauled by her own children. Eesh.) But you guys, that's where you get all the points! All our key drafted players — the Wildlings, Tormund, and Jon Snow — picked up +50 in the battle of Hardhome for their contribution to mowing down the wights, however ultimately fruitless. My heart says Jon should get a bonus score just for not dying, because it seemed all but inevitable for a second there, but hopefully his +25 for killing a White Walker with Valyrian steel is reward enough. Also, nobody should get more points than the Walkers. The Walkers won that episode by a landslide, and if they get another week like this I'm willing to consider just giving them the whole season. Technically, all tonight's Wildling points should now be Walker points. Right?   Yeah, I dunno. This is a full-fledged zombie show now, and I'm shocked at how little I mind.

Emma Stone, the actress the director chose to portray her, is not. The casting decision raised eyebrows and drew criticism from groups who said that by using Stone to play a character who explicitly states her racially mixed background throughout the movie, Crowe was whitewashing the role. Now Crowe, in a post on his own site, has offered a ""heart-felt apology to all who felt this was an odd or misguided casting choice."" The director says that he was ""grateful for the dialogue"" the backlash provided, but also took the time to defend his decision to cast Stone as Ng. ""As far back as 2007,"" Crowe writes, ""Captain Allison Ng was written to be a super-proud one-quarter Hawaiian who was frustrated that, by all outward appearances, she looked nothing like one."" Crowe, who has described Aloha as a film about Hawaii, says that her half-Chinese father was meant to symbolize ""the surprising mix of cultures often prevalent"" on the islands. The director says Ng was based on a real-life, red-haired Hawaiian local Crowe says that Ng was written to be ""extremely proud of her unlikely heritage,"" and also ""personally compelled to over-explain every chance she gets."" The character, he says, was based on a ""real-life, red-headed local"" who also detailed her background to others whenever possible. Certainly, the movie makes a point of conflating Ng's stated heritage with her outward appearances — Bradley Cooper's character makes direct reference to her self-definition as Hawaiian, in the same way Americans will define themselves as one-eighth Irish, Italian, or similar. But despite his protestations, the director does not discount the complaints about the casting choice entirely. ""I have learned something very inspiring,"" Crowe writes. ""So many of us are hungry for stories with more racial diversity, more truth in representation, and I am anxious to help tell those stories in the future.""

I hate you so, so much Two Dots, the puzzle game for iOS, has been out for about a year now. It just got updated this weekend, in fact, with some new levels and a couple new features. It's a great game. It's the kind of game that fires a tiny explosion of serotonin directly into the deepest part of my brain: it's simple but crafted. Instead of randomly-generated, endless levels you get in games like Candy Crush and the original Dots, Two Dots has levels specifically made by humans. There's an element of luck, but there's also a chance to you'll figure out the secret trick to beating a certain level. There are a lot of ways to spend money in Two Dots There's also, I should say up top, a lot of opportunities to spend money in an otherwise free game — you only get five lives and they regenerate every 20 minutes. There are boosters and regular pop-ups to spend a buck or two. You can do well at the game without spending a dime, but it will mean your pace will be slower. Apparently I have a reputation for being pretty good at these kinds of games (same thing with Threes). It's something I've cultivated because I like talking trash, but the truth is that I didn't think I was doing anything special. But maybe I was, because with Two Dots especially, there are some basic strategies for climbing through the levels that I've developed over time. So here are a few tips and tricks I've learned over the past year or so that have let me climb the levels in Two Dots.   This is the most basic strategy in Two Dots. When you connect a square of dots, it clears out all of that color from the board. It can create a virtuous cycle where every new set of dots that drops down reveals another square you can hit. But ""just make squares"" isn't the whole story. You want to look ahead, making squares on the board in strategic spots so the next move can also be a square. Looking about one move ahead is about as good as you can do in Two Dots, since the colors that come down from the top are random, so the composition of colors you have to work with changes from turn to turn. Look at least one move ahead You really want to look at least one move ahead all the time. You'll begin to see patterns that could become squares if you just clear out the right number of dots underneath them. And squares have one additional benefit that you can use to your advantage. If you clear purple squares, for example, then the dots that cascade in from the top won't be purple. It means you'll end up alternating the colors you clear. One last note: there's a ""great square"" where you connect a bunch of dots with other dots inside your square. That turns the dots inside into a bomb that blows up adjacent dots. Good fun, but sometimes it can kill your next planned move. Use them, but with caution. Two Dots almost never just gives you a big, open board of colored dots to drag your finger on. There are usually obstacles, and you need to know where on the board the squares are even possible. Focus on those and, more to the point, focus on clearing obstacles so that you have as many square-friendly zones as possible. The obstacles range from simple to infuriating (dear fire dots: I hate you with the heat of a thousand suns). Some of them, like the sandblocks or directional blocks, just sit there taking up precious space that you want to clear up so you can make more squares. Others, like the circuit blocks or fire dots (see hatred, above), can change the board radically. Here's a brief overview of the obstacles you'll find. I don't know exactly what Two Dots terminology I'm supposed to use here. This is what I call these things. Ice blocks don't stop anything, but you need to clear a few dots within them to break them. Especially as you get towards the end of your level, worry less about making squares and more about doing whatever it takes to pop the last few stragglers.   Fire dots burn up the dots next to them. But you can stop their spread: whenever you clear a dot next to a fire dot, it eliminates that fire dot. It also keeps the fire dots connected to it from spreading. So basically: focus on clearing dots next to fire dots and if you have a choice, don't split a grouping of fire dots up. Also recommended: buy a small tether for your phone so that when you're tempted to chuck the damn thing because of fire dots, you won't damage it. Sand blocks clear when you clear a dot next to them. They keep dots from cascading below them, so make sure you get the ones at the top early, and make sure you're opening up space to make squares. Directional blocks only clear when you clear a dot on the correct side of them. Highly annoying, but follow the same strategy as with the sand blocks. Make sure they're not preventing you from making squares. Also note they're destroyed by explosions (circuit blocks, exploding middle dots from a great square), so use that to your advantage if you can.   Transporters take a column of dots as they fall through the bottom and move them up to another column somewhere else on the board. They basically give you a shot at doing better prediction, and you'll want to pay close attention to how they change the way dots fall. Anchors fall to the bottom, and you need to clear the dots underneath them to get rid of them. Circle dots are probably the best kind of ""obstacle."" They can be combined with any color dot to make squares. As you're looking ahead, look for patterns of two or three dots that can be combined with a circle dot. Keep an eye out for them at the bottom, because they can block anchors and don't clear. Drawing a square with four or more circle dots clears the entire board. It seems like a great idea, but it's usually not: random dots are worse than whatever your planned next move is. Monster dots eat the dots next to them, turning them another color. They're annoying. They have little numbers inside them, which is the number of dots you need to connect to them to clear them. Sometimes you want to kill them early and sometimes you want to let them roam around the board making more of their color. If Two Dots ever combines a fire dot with a monster dot, I will probably have to go protest outside the company's headquarters. (Oh god what if the developers hadn't thought of making fire dot monsters and I just gave them the idea just now? I'm so sorry.) Circuit squares are a group of blocks that all get toggled off or on as you clear the dots inside them. You have to set the entire group to on to clear them, triggering a bomb. If you see circuit squares on the board, you probably want to think twice about making squares. Flower dots automatically connect and clear dots of the same color next to them (though they don't make squares. Stupid jerk flowers). Just kind of work at clearing the board so that like colors fall next to them. Each level starts with an splash screen that tells you what you need to clear from the board in order to win. It's usually some combination of a few obstacles. As you play, make sure you're doing more than just clearing squares — focus on hitting those goals. Most of the time, you're going to want to adjust how and where you make your squares so that you can deal with these obstacles — but don't get too focused on it. Sometimes they're just there to vex you, and what you really should be doing is watching your progress towards your level-specific goals. Actually, that's all you should be doing, all the time. Most levels start with a random placement of dots, but not all! Pay close attention to the starting setup of each board and if you start to see the same dots in the same place, that's a big hint from the level designer. Sometimes there's a clever starting strategy that can make your life a lot easer if you can figure it out at the onset. There are a bunch of boosters that you can buy which do various, random things to the board at the beginning. Sometimes it's giving you more like-colored dots so you can make squares. Sometimes it's freezing fire. Sometimes it's blowing up a bunch of random dots. The game also just added two in-level buttons for shuffling dots and erasing them. Somebody will tell you that's it's possible to beat any level without boosters. That somebody is technically telling the truth, but it's also technically possible to climb Mount Everest without any special equipment. Some levels just require it. But don't over-use them — because a booster isn't a guarantee of success. Use boosters sparingly My advice is to only use a booster on your last life, after you've spent the first four sussing out the level and getting infuriated by its maker. Also, you should save booster packs for the higher levels — whenever Two Dots introduces a new section with new obstacles, the levels are generally easier. Yes, you can buy more of them, but that can get very expensive very quickly. Instead, just make sure you play once a day. Every 24 hours, Two Dots gives you a booster challenge which will net you a free box. The nice thing about these challenges is you don't need to worry about beating a level, just hitting those goals. So keep hitting the ""find level"" button until you get some lower level that makes it easier to hit the daily goal. Look, Two Dots can be infuriating. There are levels that seem like they're custom-designed to drive you crazy and entice you to spend a buck on getting five more moves just to beat the damn thing. And if you were to give in and do that, I wouldn't judge. Nor would I judge if you spent a little money to get the ""infinite lives for X hours"" that the game sometimes offers you. These are choices that each person must make alone, decisions between you and your god. I won't pretend that I haven't done any (or, ahem, all) of the above. But mostly I just accept that the game is good for fifteen minutes of zoning out on the subway. There's enough randomness in the system to make me believe that I might get lucky tomorrow and enough design in the levels that I only sometimes feel like its true purpose is to enrage me. It's just a game, after all. A game that I'm better at than my friend Creighton.

The search giant has snatched up roughly 20 employees from Homejoy, a startup that focused on pairing house cleaners with apartment-dwellers and homeowners.

Goodbye Homejoy, hello Google Google has yet to announce any foray into home services, but Buzzfeed reported earlier this year that the company was working on a service that would connect local plumbers, cleaners, painters, and other workers with homeowners. The employees Google has picked up from Homejoy largely represent the startup's product and engineering teams, according to Recode. Their expertise could help Google build out its own service, which would likely pop up when a user searches for a plumber or cleaning person. Similar Google services already exist that let you compare prices for flights, hotels, and even car insurance when you search. Homejoy launched in 2012 as a website designed to make it easier for people to find and schedule house cleanings from verified cleaners. More recently, it began to set up appointments for other tasks around the house, like carpet cleaning services and repairs from handymen. The startup faced stiff competition from sites like Handy, TaskRabbit, and, more recently, Amazon itself, which launched its own home services product just over a month ago.

Yahoo describes the new app, which was first spotted by TechCrunch, as ""the most natural way to have REAL conversations,"" promising that the app will make you ""feel like your friends are right there with you."" It tries to accomplish this by allowing you to share silent video of yourself with a friend, while typing your thoughts in text that pops up over the video. So... perhaps not the most natural way to have real conversations after all.  Yahoo's once-popular desktop messaging app, Yahoo Messenger, was left behind after the rise of mobile apps led to new giants like WhatsApp, Hangouts, and Facebook Messenger. Yahoo moved slowly in updating Messenger for mobile devices; it was the only major app Marissa Mayer didn't overhaul after becoming CEO, and it was ultimately removed from the App Store. Livetext looks like an effort to build a messaging app that will resonate with a younger audience, though not including the audio portion of the video call seems counterintuitive. The release notes say audio is ""rarely convenient in today's fast-paced world"" (what?), a line that just seems like Livetext it trying too hard to set itself apart.   The app — which is ""free forever"" — uses your cell phone's Wi-Fi or data connection to start one-on-one conversations. You initiate conversations by texting a friend, and the video begins immediately upon the recipient entering the chat. To share a thought, you type it into the text box and watch it pop up on your screen over the video. We imagine it might be like having a muted Skype call, with text. The app was quietly released on the Hong Kong iTunes Store on July 11th, but has yet to come to the United States. It's likely Yahoo will make a bigger, splashier announcement once the app is ready to be released worldwide.

That's the way Turing Robotics Industries CEO SYL Chao introduces the Turing Phone, an Android smartphone that aims to put security, durability, and fashion above all else. In a myriad of ways, the Turing is anything but your typical phone. There's no headphone jack, and the thing doesn't even have a USB connector. Instead, you charge it with a plug that looks like a clone of Apple's MagSafe.  But Chao would have you believe that the Turing Phone makes up for these unconventional design choices in other ways. First off, the device's frame and exterior chrome are made of ""liquidmorphium,"" or liquid metal, which is claimed to be stronger than steel and titanium — and impervious to bending. The reflective qualities of liquidmorphium are unique, and Chao likens the mirror-like appearance to a skyscraper. ""There’s always a new material that sets the stage for the upcoming era,"" he says.    That ""era"" is one in which companies make security, encryption, and safeguarding your data their top priority. ""Consumers shouldn't have to worry,"" Chao says. But so far, even after the Snowden disclosures, most consumers still aren't in the mindset where they'd seek this kind of thing out. The standout feature of Turing, according to Chao, is the Turing Imitation Key. Rather than rely on third parties for authentication and encryption duties, Turing Robotics has built its own end-to-end, decentralized authentication scheme that is fully functional offline since it relies on your phone's private key. ""It changes the paradigm completely,"" Chao says. This makes it difficult for outsiders to intercept or compromise your messages and sensitive data contained in Turing's apps, though Chao admits nothing is uncrackable. ""If they put 10,000 men on the machine, surely they can crack it."" As it's based on Android 5.1, the Turing still allows full access to Google Play and popular apps. No one would bother with it otherwise. The unfortunate custom skin you see in the images below isn't final; Chao says the finished interface will differ substantially. Still, potential buyers will probably want to install a custom launcher. waterproof and made from liquid metal The Turing is also fully waterproof thanks to a nanocoating that shields its internal components. It can survive dunks in the pool and most submersions without issue. Those internals aren't top of the line, however; the Turing is powered by an aging 2.5GHz Snapdragon 801 chip and features a 5.5-inch, 1080p display that falls short of today's big-brand flagships in terms of sharpness. But Turing Robotics isn't Samsung, and in fairness the screen looked fine. Around back is a 13-megapixel camera, non-removable 3,000mAh battery and integrated NFC chip. But in yet another far out, strange idea, the phone comes with a built-in cryptocurrency called Turing coin. Chao says the device could appreciate in value if it somehow catches on. That sounds like a dream, which is maybe something you can say about this entire project. Is anyone actually going to buy this thing? Chao seems to think so, and there are even plans to open a New York City retail store next year. That makes this seem more like a Vertu rival than a true mainstream gadget, but Chao disagrees. ""This is mass market, but geared towards the designers and fashion-consious individuals. The elite."" If you think you fit that bill, you'll be able to preorder the Turing Phone starting July 31st for $610 (16GB), $740 (64GB), or $870 (128GB). 10,000 of them will be made to start. There's no shortage of reasons why this product may fall on its face. Google already has an enormous security team working every day to keep Android safe, and here you're trusting a lesser-known company with protecting some of that data. And then there's the missing headphone jack and weird charging port, two hardware decisions that will almost definitely prove too inconvenient for users. But at the very least, it's interesting and fun to see something this out of the ordinary pop up amid the regular rotation of smartphone announcements. Don't count on it kicking off the ""cipher age,"" but it's still intriguing. The Turing Phone's ""Beowulf"" color option features a purple, black, and gold design. The Turing Phone's fingerprint sensor is located on the device's left side, an unconventional spot compared to the iPhone and Galaxy S6. Turing Robotics Industries claims the fingerprint sensor's accuracy rivals Apple and Samsung. This design is certainly unlike anything we've seen from the big manufacturers. The Turing Phone's internal frame and outside chrome are made from liquidmorphium. There's no microUSB port to be found; the Turing Phone uses a MagSafe-like connector. Turing plans to run a custom interface on top of Android 5.1. Thankfully this isn't the final design, according to SYL Chao. The Turing Phone's interface animates as you move and rotate the device. All three Turing Phones will go up for pre-order July 31st.",0.7136278466901081,0.28637215330989185,0.16548846426641337,828,5.0893719806763285,489,6.1022494887525562,0,24,"Google, Mobile, Tech, Hands-on, Photo Essay",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

And, in some cases, women surpass men altogether. women’s cognitive abilities benefit far more ""As living conditions increase, so do men and women’s cognitive abilities — but women’s more than men’s,"" says Agneta Herlitz, co-author of the study and a psychologist at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden. Other studies have been able to show increases in cognition over time, Herlitz says, ""but we show that this happens more for women than for men, and that gives rise to slightly different patterns in cognitive differences."" Herlitz and her colleagues used cognitive data from 30,000 individuals that had been gathered in 2006 across 13 European countries. The data set included people born between 1923 and 1957. This information allowed them to analyze the participants’ cognitive abilities with regards to numeracy, episodic memory — their ability to recall moments — and category fluency, or the ability to name as many objects, animals, or plants as possible within a certain category. Then, they compared these results to total fertility rate, infant mortality rates, educational levels, life expectancy rates, and gross domestic product (GDP) that each participant experienced at the age of 25. The researchers did not include medical information in their analysis, however. ""a slight advantage in episodic memory."" ""Our result show that women in these European countries have a slight advantage in episodic memory,"" Herlitz explains. They also found that improving social conditions eliminated differences in category fluency between men and women. ""We don’t know why"" women excelled more than men in these tasks when social conditions improved, Herlitz says, but researchers think it might have to do with the fact that women, generally, are ""treated more badly,"" so they ""start from a lower level,"" and may subsequently get a bigger boost from improvements that also benefit men. That wasn’t the case across the board, Herlitz point outs. ""It’s not always that [women] are better than men, because they are still much worse in the numeracy task."" This, she says, might be because math proficiency tends to be encouraged in men more than in women. ""The same can be said with verbal ability since people talk more to small girls."" But separating biological components from cultural components is extremely difficult, she said. And ""most researchers would probably say that there are biological differences at play here, as well as cultural and environmental factors."" ""It’s not always that [women] are better than men."" Diane Halpern, former president of the American Psychology Association and an expert on sex differences in cognition, agreed with Herlitz in an email to The Verge. ""The development of cognitive abilities is always both"" a matter of nature and nurture, she said. ""It is more usual to think about the multiple ways biology, individual differences, societal, and cultural factors interact."" This might explain why Herlitz and her team used the word ""gender,"" a social construct, in the study, without separating it from the biological term ""sex."" ""I have used sex differences and gender differences in the past without much thought,"" Herlitz says. Still, some cognition experts favor environmental factors over biological ones, as evidenced by David Reilly, a psychologist at Griffith University in Australia, who told The Verge that ""if there were strong and immutable biological differences, we wouldn't see this shift in abilities over time, or across regions."" Reilly also pointed out how unique Herlitz’s study is, because it found an association between gender equality and cognitive abilities in older adults. ""We don't have any studies linking older adults ability to gender equality measures,"" he said in an email. But ""what [the researchers] have done is find a link between gender equality and cognitive ability in previous generations,"" which means they’re long-lasting. ""That's very impressive,"" he said, ""and has some important public policy and education implications."" Yet, Janet Hyde, a psychologist the University of Wisconsin-Madison who did not participate in the study, isn’t convinced by some aspects of the research. She told The Verge that although she thinks the findings make sense, comparing people born before 1945 with people born afterward is questionable, especially when that information does not include medical histories. ""They have birth cohorts from as early as 1927,"" she said in an email. ""Those birth cohorts lived through WWII, during major periods of starvation as well as exposure to bombing and other events that would be likely to lead to PTSD."" All of those events would have effects on cognitive function in later life, so it’s hard to make ""meaningful comparisons of groups who experienced that major event with those born after it."" But Halpern doesn't think this is a problem, because the researchers used a very large sample size and selected each participant at random — a method that allowed them to treat the health of their sample as approximately equivalent. ""A major event like WWII is obviously important,"" she said, but ""there are always issues in comparing cross-sectional age groups."" That shouldn’t change the conclusions, she said. ""The paper is very well done,"" and ""the science is sound."" ""For some reason, it’s hard to accept that there may be differences in men and women.""  Both Halpern and Herlitz know this study will raise many questions, and might even be deemed controversial. But raising questions is ""what a good research paper should do,"" Halpern says. And for Herlitz, the controversy that this study, and others, might generate is misguided. ""For some reason, it's hard to accept that there may be differences in men and women,"" Herlitz explains, adding that gender differences do not in any way need to imply that we should not live in gender-equal societies. And in truth, she says, it's not these differences that cause problems, but how we value them. ""Obviously the abilities that women have are valued less — that's what affects things.""",0.5200339758469755,0.4799660241530245,0.22862212219300257,1081,5.3598519888991678,525,6.3733333333333331,0,0,"Science, Report",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

One of the latest: a Russian satellite called Foton-M No. 4 that was launched into orbit last week containing fruit flies once again. But this time there were also five geckos, whose sex lives were going to be studied on camera — for science. That was until one of the engines controlling the satellite stopped responding to ground commands that were trying to raise the vessel into a higher orbit. According to a representative for Russia's Institute of Medico-Biological problems who spoke with Agence France-Presse, all other parts of the satellite are working as expected, including life support systems that will keep the experiments running. Scientists are also able to remotely monitor data that's being sent back. However, the geckos have a limited food supply that could run out in just two and a half months, which could happen long before the satellite falls out of orbit and back down towards Earth, says The Guardian. In the meantime, officials are attempting to restore communication with the satellite. The geckos were one of several experiments The experiment with the geckos was designed to see if, and how the animals reproduce in microgravity, as well as if there are changes in the survival of eggs.

Often, they turn their attention to offspring, because numerous studies, some conducted on the children of Holocaust survivors, have shown that parents can pass symptoms of trauma onto their kids. This is called ""intergenerational trauma,"" and although it’s been described in academic literature, researchers still don’t fully understand how it occurs. One idea is that symptoms like anxiety and depression can be passed down through changes in gene expression in sperm. But what of specific fears, like a fear of dentists? How do they make their way into the psyche? According to a new study, published today in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the mechanism might be scent — at least when the fear occurs in mice. ""We found that the mother that expresses fear in the presence of their newborn pups passes her fear to her pups through scent,"" says Jacek Debiec, a psychiatrist at The University of Michigan and a co-author of the study. ""And these fears are long-lasting."" In the study, Debiec and his team exposed adult female mice to the smell of peppermint, a ""neutral"" scent, while giving them mild electric shocks. This produced long-term fear response in the female mice that researchers were then able to trigger using peppermint. Then, the researchers matched the mice with males who hadn’t undergone the fear conditioning, so they could mate. The peppermint triggered a fear response in the pups too ""Once the pups were born, we exposed them and their mothers to the peppermint odor,"" Debiec says. The fear that the mothers expressed in the presence of the pups helped the newborns learn to fear peppermint as well. And eventually, Debiec says, ""it also triggered fear in the pups when the mother wasn’t around."" But that experiment alone wasn’t enough to explain how the mothers were transmitting fears onto their pups. So, the researchers separated the mothers from their pups so that only their scent could reach the pups. This made sense, because newborn mice are ""underdevelopped"" compared to human babies, Debiec says, meaning their eyes and ears aren’t fully functional. And the experiment worked: the pups learned to fear peppermint even when they couldn’t see or hear their mothers — and even after they were weaned. ""Once they learned the fear response through scent, the pups avoided the peppermint odor,"" Debiec says, or froze in fear. Moreover, to make sure that changes in gene expression in the mother weren’t contributing to the fear transmission, the researchers used foster mothers. Even when the mothers weren’t related to the pups, the results were unchanged. Even when the mothers weren’t related to the pups, the results were unchanged ""Newborns don’t really make much of their own experience in their surrounding environments,"" Debiec says. ""But fear responses can still be passed down."" This might seem like a huge disadvantage for the pups, but it’s actually considered a fairly efficient way of learning about the world. ""It’s ecologically important that pups acquire information about fears outside of the nest before by being exposed to [the mother’s] fear before they leave it,"" he says. The problem only arises when this also applies to things like PTSD or a fear of dentists, Debiec says, ""because it’s exaggerated."" The researchers think that the association between the fear response and the peppermint occurs through elevated blood corticosterone, a hormone that’s equivalent to human cortisol. ""We found that exposure to the frightened mom significantly elevated these levels,"" Debiec says. conducting a similar study in humans wouldn't be ethical It’s too early to know how this experiment applies to humans, because it’s still unclear to what extent humans use chemicals to communicate with each other. And conducting a similar study in humans isn’t feasible because the ethics behind it would be extremely questionable. Still, Debiec says, the idea that a mother can pass her fears down to her offspring in a long-term fashion is important. ""Learning is usually short-lived in human and non-human infants; it’s what we can ‘infantile amnesia,’"" Debiec says. As a result, newborn mice rarely remember what they learn when they’re in a pre-weaning state. But, similar to fears that arise after a child experiences abuse, the fear response triggered by the peppermint persisted — something that Debiec says points to how powerful parental influence can be. Rachel Yehuda, a psychiatrist at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York who did not participate in the study, told The Verge in an email that Debiec’s findings are ""very interesting,"" but she didn’t find them altogether surprising. ""Those of us who have studied populations such as adult children of Holocaust survivors have seen evidence of, and have attempted to describe, this kind of transmission in the clinical arena,"" she said. Still, she said, the study is valuable because it includes the type of molecular analysis that would not be possible in living human brains. it took the field a while to even believe this was a legitimate phenomenon  ""It took the field a while to even believe this was a legitimate phenomenon,"" Yahuda said, but the science of intergenerational transmission is now increasingly accepted. This is a good thing, she said, because identifying the brain changes that result from such transmission could play a crucial role in helping people understand the impact of parental experiences.

A massive solar storm emitted from the sun could fry electronics and satellites around the globe, and take down much of the power grid. And such a storm isn't as far-fetched as you might think: according to readings taken from a satellite in earth's orbit, a solar superstorm passed through earth's path on July 23rd, 2012 — if it had struck nine days earlier, our planet would have been right in the crosshairs. A 2009 report from the National Academy of Sciences said that such a storm could cause some $2.6 trillion in damage and a full recovery could take years. One researcher who studied data collected from the storm, professor Ying D. Liu of China’s State Key Laboratory of Space Weather, said that repairs could take two to four years. That's mainly because many of the massive transformers that make up the power grid would be taken offline by such a solar storm. Parts for those transformers are very difficult to come by. Storm could have left 130 million without power John Kappenmann, a co-author of the National Academy of Sciences' 2009 report, found that a large solar storm could leave 130 million in the dark. Without power, Kappenmann explains that ""water distribution [would be] affected within several hours; perishable foods and medications lost in 12-24 hours; loss of heating/air conditioning, sewage disposal, phone service, fuel re-supply, and so on."" In addition to damage to the power grid, a storm would shut down satellites and bring GPS and radio systems offline, at least temporarily. The type of solar storm in question is known as a coronal mass ejection (CME), which occurs when an eruption on the sun shoots magnetized plasma clouds, X-rays, UV radiation, and protons and electrons out into space at extremely high speeds. CMEs are not rare, but the one that occurred on July 23rd, 2012, was particularly potent. Researchers from UC Berkeley concluded that the storm in question was in fact two separate CME events separated by 10 to 15 minutes. Storm missed earth by nine days The largest recorded CME to hit earth occurred in 1859; at the time, it sent sparks flying from telegraph wires and produced Northern Lights as far south as Hawaii and Cuba, according to reports. Researcher Daniel Baker from the University of Colorado said in a NASA article that ""in my view the July 2012 storm was in all respects at least as strong as the 1859 Carrington event."" Despite the danger posed by such solar storms, the July 23rd event was not quite the ""near miss"" some news reports have painted it as. The earth was roughly a third of the way around its orbit from the location where the CME struck. Nevertheless, some researchers say that there is as much as a 12 percent chance that a storm the size of the 1859 strike will hit earth in the next decade. If we create better early warning systems, experts say, it may be possible to protect some sensitive electronics from a strike by shielding them or disconnecting them prior to a strike.",0.33376910488506767,0.6662308951149323,0.8269982123512634,526,4.7832699619771866,315,5.6888888888888891,0,0,Science,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The project, developed by Google's experimental Google X wing and called Baseline Study, sees the company first harvesting anonymous genetic and molecular information from 175 people. According to The Wall Street Journal, Baseline Study will soon draw information from thousands more in a bid to create a picture of a person in perfect health. Project Baseline will collect genetic and molecular data The project is designed to pull together a huge amount of data that will not only allow medical professionals to detect and treat major health issues such as heart disease and cancer earlier, but will also enable them to detect trends and patterns in human health, making medicine more about the prevention of illness than the cure. It's helmed by Dr. Andrew Conrad, who joined Google X in March 2013 after helping develop cheap, high-volume HIV tests for blood plasma donations. The Wall Street Journal reports Conrad has built of a team of between 70 and 100 experts for the projects, from medical fields including physiology, biochemistry, optics, imaging, and molecular biology. Project Baseline will use Google's computational power to identify ""biomarkers"" in the data that could help people stave off or avoid health issues. Medical science has traditionally discovered biomarkers for late stage diseases, but it's Google's hope that Project Baseline will also be able to crunch through data to detect tendencies in our bodies that can be addressed before they become life-threatening. Dr. Conrad posits an example where the data allows researchers to pick out a biomarker that shows some people can break down fatty foods efficiently. Others, he suggests, may lack the marker, putting them at risk from heart disease. By identifying such trends before the disease has become too severe and treatment is necessary, Project Baseline's information could suggest people change their behavior before their first heart attack, or enable scientists to develop something to help at-risk people break down fatty foods. The exam includes the collection of bodily fluids including urine and tears Dr. Conrad warns against expecting the data to spit out an immediate cure for cancer, saying that advances will be made in ""little increments."" The project began this summer when a clinical testing firm that Conrad declined to name enrolled 175 people in an exam that demands the collection of bodily fluids including urine and tears. The unnamed clinic, plus other facilities at Duke and Stanford Universities, will run further exams in the future, collecting samples and removing information such as names and social security numbers from participants. The rapidly decreasing cost of collecting genetic and molecular information has only recently made Project Baseline possible. Participants' genomes will now be sequenced — a process that once cost $100 million, now reduced to around $1,000 — along with their parents' genetic history. The Wall Street Journal says data on how they metabolize food, nutrients and drugs, how fast their hearts beat under stress and how chemical reactions change the behavior of their genes will also be recorded. Participants' genomes will be sequenced The project promises much, but by collecting so much information about participants, it also raises privacy concerns. What happens if a person's molecular makeup get into the hands of others? Already Google has clarified the medical data it receives will be anonymous by the time it gets its hands on it, and specified that such information would not be shared with insurance firms. Dr. Sam Gambhir, a Stanford doctor who has been working with Google for more than year, says that the issue of privacy has been discussed. ""Google will not be allowed free rein to do whatever it wants with this data,"" he told The Wall Street Journal. It's unclear how Project Baseline will tie in to Calico, the Google company tasked with extending human life, but it's obvious the company is serious about making humans live longer. But although Google X is actively entering the health care market, creating glucose-measuring contact lenses, the company's leaders have expressed their frustration at the industry's regulation and restrictions. Speaking earlier this month, Google co-founder Sergey Brin said health care in the US was ""so heavily regulated that it's just a painful business to be in;"" at May's Code conference, he expressed his exasperation over how jealously medical companies guard their data, suggesting that by applying machine learning to existing sets of data to pick out patterns, hundreds of thousands of lives could be saved every year.

At the time, the cable-news giant said that Zite’s algorithms for personalizing news would transform its digital presence. ""The Zite technology can also help CNN’s websites and apps serve more personalized content, making our current digital services even better,"" said KC Estenson, general manager of CNN Digital, at the time. Yet yesterday, CNN unloaded Zite onto Flipboard in an all-stock deal that gives it a small equity stake in the company. Allowed to operate mostly independently for two and a half years, the app’s growth had slowed, ad revenue was negligible, and that vaunted Zite technology never materialized on CNN’s digital properties. Naturally, everyone involved hailed the deal as a rousing success. ""We didn’t wither and die, we actually thrived,"" Zite’s CEO, Mark Johnson, told The Verge of Zite's time at CNN. ""It didn’t work out exactly as planned, but it worked out for everybody involved."" An app that keeps failing upward But it’s time to take a more skeptical look at newsreading apps, which continue to attract millions of dollars in investment from venture capitalists who believe they will prove to be enormous businesses. Consider the recent history: Yahoo launched and killed Livestand; AOL launched and killed Editions; Google launched Currents and then folded it into its Newsstand app. Pulse, a popular early iPad app, sold itself off to LinkedIn. The fate of Facebook’s take on the genre, called Paper, remains to be seen — but it has been languishing in the App Store. The premise of apps like these is that they will find interesting articles for you that you never would have seen otherwise. From their perspective, the more obscure your interests, the better. Johnson filled his own Zite with stories about volcanoes, linguistics, and astronomy. On Prismatic, a similar app that has raised $15 million, I’ve followed San Francisco, Spotify, and messaging apps, among other subjects. And yet for all the millions spent and the machine-learning algorithms that have been built, none of them have improved on the big portals — CNN, The New York Times — or social networks like Twitter or Facebook, which bring you both the news and the conversation happening around it. Newsreading-app developers hire PhDs to do the easiest thing imaginable — find you something interesting on the internet that you haven’t already seen — and then beat you over the head with it, bludgeoning you with an endless barrage of links that never feel half as personalized as they’re made out to be. Hiring PhDs to do the easiest thing in the world The truth is that the news remains stubbornly impersonal. The crisis in Ukraine or the scene at the Oscars may not affect your life directly, but you’re likely have some interest in it anyway. That’s why big portals and social networks are so effective at delivering the news: they cater to broad audiences, and to the stories that move us to share them. Most of us don’t have enough niche interests to spur us to open a specialized niche-news app every day, no matter the quality of its machine learning. Apps like these are only ever going to get so far helping people find hidden news about volcanoes. Notably, Flipboard has succeeded while mostly avoiding the content-discovery game. The app grew to 100 million users by offering a sleek, elegant user interface for browsing the news and social networks simultaneously. It brought a relaxed, magazine-like reading experience to the busy, often ugly world of online news consumption and has thrived as a result. Adding an expensive content-discovery layer to Flipboard is unlikely to hurt the company much — but it seems unlikely to help much, either. For its part, CNN says its vision of a personalized news site will someday be realized. For one thing, the company kept a copy of the Zite code as part of the sale, enabling it to deploy it through CNN’s products however it likes. ""We’re still in that game,"" Estenson told me. ""I personally believe that technology can help us out a lot."" ""We're still in that game."" And what does Flipboard get, exactly? The deal includes new CNN content inside Flipboard in the form of new ""social magazines,"" and a revenue-sharing deal for advertising on those magazines. Beyond that, it’s hard to say; Flipboard did not respond to an interview request. In a blog post, CEO Mike McCue echoed Estenson from when Zite sold the first time around: ""Adding Zite’s expertise in personalization and recommendations to Flipboard’s product experience and powerful curator community will create an unparalleled personal magazine for our millions of readers."" That would be more than it ever did for CNN. Zite had a small but vocal fan base, and its engineers’ talents are apparent. And Flipboard, which has a world-class team of product builders, may well prove more adept at integrating a team of software engineers than a cable news network. But twice now Zite has sold a dream of personalization that keeps failing to materialize.

These aircraft can travel in around the globe, relying on the sun for power to stay aloft for years at a time. They carry a payload of up to 250 pounds. Why does a social network need a high-tech satellite? Reportedly, Facebook wants to bring internet access to parts of the developing world that haven’t built out the infrastructure for web access on the ground. That’s a noble mission, although Facebook certainly has a bigger business agenda as well. Most interestingly, the move means that Facebook is now competing directly with Google and its Project Loon to bring internet access to the rapidly shrinking landscape of the unwired world. Loon, which has been in beta testing since 2011, uses a swarm of weather balloons that cruise through the stratosphere and beam web access down to special receivers on the ground. So which approach is better: Loon or drone? A long history of failed attempts to provide aerial internet access There is actually a long history of failed attempts to provide aerial internet access. Starting in the 1990s at least five big projects were announced, including Iridium and Globalstar, both of which aimed to provide cellphone coverage. They were actually built but promptly went bankrupt.  Teledesic, a venture funded by by Bill Gates, Paul Allen, and Saudi prince Al-Waleed bin Talal, got a lot of people interested but was scrapped before it launched its first constellation. One problem with these early efforts was that people on the ground required bulky, custom handsets in order to receive the signal. But the rapid and widespread proliferation of cheap, powerful smartphones means that’s no longer a major obstacle. ""Fixed-wing drones are more reliable when it comes to flying longer distance due to their low consumption of battery power,"" says Chris Sanz, CEO of Skycatch. A big balloon with hot air is much riskier to keep in the air and moves more slowly. On the other hand, balloons are far safer and more commonplace. ""One danger I can think of is one of these drones falling into a populated area,"" says Sanz. At 165 feet wide and weighing in at 350 pounds, a Solara could do a lot of damage if it fell out of the sky.     Getting the aircraft over the right area remains tricky. ""71 percent of the world is water, and of the part that is land, 98 percent isn’t very interesting or populated,"" says Iain McClatchie, an aerospace engineer who formerly worked on drone projects for Google. ""Drones are much more likely to be able to maintain position. But both they and the balloons are going to get pushed around a lot by stratospheric winds, which can get up to 100 miles per hour."" ""One danger ... is one of these drones falling into a populated area."" The lightweight nature of Google’s balloons, however, comes with certain advantages. Free internet access sounds benevolent, but flying dozens or even hundreds of aircraft in constant orbit over a sovereign nation can raise a lot of questions from local governments. ""Whatever goes into China’s airspace is going to end up on the ground,"" says McClatchie with a chuckle. Project Loon is far more innocuous, joining upwards of 70,000 weather balloons that orbit the planet at any given time. Given the US history with drones, many countries may be nervous about allowing a private fleet of them to orbit in their airspace, even if Facebook promises they’re doing nothing beyond providing internet access. In terms of durability, however, Project Loon faces some challenges. ""The weather balloons they are using are very thin and wear out pretty quickly. Since you can’t really predict when that will happen, a lot of balloons end up in the ocean,"" says McClatchie. ""Drones are much easier to bring in for a landing when you need to make repairs or update the software."" ""Whatever goes into China’s airspace is going to end up on the ground."" Google’s approach may rely instead on sheer numbers. ""The actual balloons are way, way cheaper than drones, of course,"" says McClatchie. ""Although the electronics on each balloon are still pretty expensive."" Given that things are still in the experimental phase, Google may prefer to lose weather balloons that cost a few hundred dollars instead of drones that cost a few million. ""The major cost of drones, especially ones optimized for super long flights, is crashing them,"" McClatchie notes. So why take all this expensive risk? In both cases, the rationale so far has centered around the idea of bringing internet to people in undeveloped areas, the so-called ""next billion"" who will be joining the internet and rising into the middle class. McClatchie acknowledges this is a piece of the puzzle, although he suspects there’s more at play. ""This technology is moving towards providing robust internet access for mobile devices. In terms of a return on the cost, just providing that service to people in rural Africa and Asia doesn’t make sense."" ""It’s a gold rush for a prime piece of real estate.""A new ruling from a judge at the National Transportation Safety Board has paved the way for commercial drone flights to begin legally in American skies. Project Loon and Facebook’s drones could, someday soon, also be used to help provide internet access in rural America, where broadband access is spotty and expensive. ""Right now the stratosphere is wide open,"" says McClatchie. ""It’s a gold rush for a prime piece of real estate that the big internet companies think will be very valuable in the decades to come.""",0.5034639180549692,0.49653608194503085,0.8470649717083806,1055,5.5753554502369669,561,7.2513368983957216,0,0,"Business, Tech, US & World, Report",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

As one of the co-founders of Android, he is walking through a world that has been all but conquered by the operating system he helped create. Now, as a general partner at Google Ventures, he’s tasked with finding and investing the search giant’s billions in the next big thing. When most people think about Android and its origins, they think of Andy Rubin — but he didn't do it all on his own. Miner, a seasoned entrepreneur with a doctorate in computer science, was Rubin’s co-founder, and he played a crucial role in getting Android the traction it needed in the early days.  Miner stops by Nokia's booth to play with one of its new Android devices, the first smartphones from the humbled Finnish titan to use Google's operating system. “The biggest shift in the show has been to more of a focus on the consumer,” says Miner, who came to Barcelona for the first time in the late 1990s. Nowadays, it's all about “hitting the show floor and seeing what the latest gadgets are and then using that to sort of infer trends.” As he sits in a swing checking out the device, a costumed zombie wanders over. Miner doesn't miss a beat.    Miner cut his teeth in the world of mobile as a vice president at European carrier Orange, which bought Wildfire, a voice-based personal assistant (think Siri without a graphical user interface) that he co-founded in the mid-1990s. He also was a key part of Orange's venture efforts before leaving the company for Android. (Orange was an initial investor in Danger, Inc., the Rubin-founded company behind the Sidekick line of devices.) In 2005 Google acquired Android. Miner joined the search giant and four years later he became a General Partner at Google Ventures, the company’s investment arm. Miner now spends his days crisscrossing the globe, meeting with startups, helping founders to make important hires, closing key deals, and writing the checks that get companies from an idea on a napkin to their first working prototype.  ""Finding really bright people that we can help out is what we do,"" he notes. ""Finding really bright people that we can help out is what we do."" While it has only been in existence for five years, Google Ventures has risen to become one of Silicon Valley’s more prominent and active investors, putting money into over 225 companies across a variety of categories to date — including massive rounds for Uber and Nest. According to data gathered by CB Insights, Google Ventures is far and away the largest corporate investment group, completing six times as many deals as its nearest rivals, Intel and Qualcomm. Miner is an important partner in a number of Google Ventures' investment categories, including companies involved with enterprise services and commerce technologies. But he's at Mobile World Congress for a reason: mobile is his forte, and he's one of the key decision makers for Google Ventures when it comes to the apps and services that will power this next generation of personal computing. He’s soft-spoken but witty and insightful; as we patrol the floor, he quickly finds what’s interesting (or not) about whatever he’s looking at. And of course, at heart, he’s still a smartphone fanboy with plenty of strong opinions. ""I don’t know why a carrier is going to want this,"" says Miner, turning Nokia’s new Android-powered X over in his palm. ""I’m just tickled to see a Nokia with Android."" Miner understands the nuances of the mobile gadget world, a trait which lets him offer his startups sage advice. ""So I guarantee you when the Samsung [Galaxy S5] comes out there’s gonna be some app somewhere that starts to have some problem because of some new feature capability,"" Miner tells the CEO of Crittercism, a Google Ventures-backed company with a booth at MWC. ""If you’re running Crittercism, you’ll hear about it from the analytics they give you before customers start calling and complaining about it. And then you can get a quick patch out and hear about it from customers and respond to it quickly."" Dispensing this kind of help to startups is the rule, not the exception. CEOs of Google Ventures-backed companies have told The Verge that the firm typically has more hands-on involvement with its investments than other firms. It provides a variety of services from design consulting to management and marketing training that many other VC companies don't offer. Companies in the portfolio also have close access to Google engineers and processes around managing products and setting goals. The firm straddles the line between a full-on incubator and a traditional venture-capitalist fundraiser — it's a bit like boot camp for startups, but in a Google-y way. Arguably, these perks are almost as important as the funding itself: when Rich Miner is your lead investor, you're bound to get insights into the mobile industry — and the future of Android — that other competitors might not be privy to. Speaking with The Verge, Miner notes that the sheer density and size of the show — the GSMA estimates that over 85,000 attendees traipsed the floors of Barcelona's Fire Gran Via convention center this year — makes it much easier to spot the trends happening in mobile. Visiting booths and getting first-person experience with the newly-announced products is a lot of what Miner does here in order to get a sense of upcoming shifts in the space. It's usually not that hard to find what the major companies have to announce — their enormous, expensive booths and high-profile press conferences tend to dominate the talking points during this show. But locating the up-and-coming startups is more difficult. ""Even if you are a startup and you’re not showing on the floor, if you’re in mobile, you’re typically here at the show meeting with people,"" notes Miner. ""It requires a little bit of forensic work, but you can find the startups."" That doesn't mean to say trade shows like MWC are where Google Ventures makes all of its deals and investment decisions; many deals are still made over the coffee or beer, or are the product of months of work and pitches from founders. But every little bit of exposure can help a small company. As Miner notes, ""We’ve certainly made decisions to invest in companies when we’ve seen the interest that they’ve had at the show."" While deciphering trends often has a lot to do with actual products announced, finding the next great investment for Google Ventures begins with the people involved. ""When we’re looking to invest in startups, the key thing is that you’re investing in teams and people, that is absolutely the most important,"" says Miner. ""You’ve got to think you’ve got an incredibly bright founding team with strong instincts or management skills, or that there’s a spark there that you think they can grow, and you can build a company around them,"" he says. What the founders are actually working on takes a backseat to their instincts and personalities. ""Hopefully they are working on something interesting that you think you can help them out with what they are trying to build,"" continues Miner. ""But it always starts with the people, then the vision of what they are trying to build, and then further along whether you can market it."" Finding the proverbial needle in the haystack is what Google Ventures does, and its portfolio shows that it's had some big successes doing that over the years. While much of the conversation in the technology world centers around what the Apples, Googles, Microsofts, and Samsungs of the industry are up to, some of the most interesting things are happening under the radar by companies that aren't in the spotlight. If those companies are hiding in the halls and back rooms of Mobile World Congress or a coffee shop in a hip Boston neighborhood, Rich Miner will be there to find them.",0.6465163112289777,0.3534836887710223,0.8147702696556557,1358,4.9248895434462447,654,6.2477064220183482,1,0,,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

In an email to The Verge, Spotify says that all of The Echo Nest's existing business contracts will be fulfilled, meaning its competitors' music recommendations are safe for the short term. Whether competitors will be able to extend their contracts with The Echo Nest or begin new ones now that it's under Spotify is another question.

To that end, it's an aggressive purchase by Spotify that should help to keep it on top. And it may only be the first: Spotify recently raised a large round of funding — reportedly $250 million — which should give it plenty to space to make strategic acquisitions like this. Today's acquisition may spell particularly bad news for Rdio, which has been struggling with layoffs and has already had to close one major product to focus on its core. While Rdio hasn't always relied on The Echo Nest, it's been using it for several years and would likely have to spend more resources than it would like to right now toward catching up on recommendations, should it be cut off by Spotify. For its part, Rdio downplays its reliance on The Echo Nest. ""[The Echo Nest API] is just one of the many tools we use to create the best personalized listening experience for people on Rdio,"" the company says in a statement to The Verge. For now, it isn't clear how much it should be worrying: Spotify tells us that it sees The Echo Nest's API and ecosystem as ""really important,"" and it seems that it's is still determining how best to handle them going forward.",0.6391122253365447,0.36088777466345534,0.20228186999507214,467,4.8094218415417558,253,5.6600790513833994,0,0,"Business, Entertainment",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

There are more than a hundred years of photography here, from FDR on the campaign trail to last Sunday's Oscars, all stamped with the same transparent square placard reminding you that you don't own the rights. If you want Getty to take off the watermark, you'll have to pay for it. ""Our content was everywhere already."" Starting now, that's going to change. Getty Images is dropping the watermark for the bulk of its collection, in exchange for an open-embed program that will let users drop in any image they want, as long as the service gets to append a footer at the bottom of the picture with a credit and link to the licensing page. For a small-scale WordPress blog with no photo budget, this looks an awful lot like free stock imagery. It's a real risk for the company, since it's easy to screenshot the new versions if you want to snag an unlicensed version. But according to Craig Peters, a business development exec at Getty Images, that ship sailed long ago. ""Look, if you want to get a Getty image today, you can find it without a watermark very simply,"" he says. ""The way you do that is you go to one of our customer sites and you right-click. Or you go to Google Image search or Bing Image Search and you get it there. And that's what's happening… Our content was everywhere already.""  The new embeds strike directly at social sharing Looking at the pictures on Twitter, it's hard to disagree. Wildly popular accounts like @historyinpics can amass hundreds of thousands of followers with nothing but uncredited, unlicensed images, and since there's no direct revenue, there's little point in asking them to pay. At that scale, anything more expensive than free is a prohibitive cost. The new embeds strike directly at that kind of social sharing, with native code for sharing in Twitter and Tumblr alongside the traditional WordPress-friendly embed code. Peters' bet is that if web publishers have a legal, free path to use the images, they'll take it, opening up a new revenue stream for Getty and photographers. The new money comes because, once the images are embedded, Getty has much more control over the images. The new embeds are built on the same iframe code that lets you embed a tweet or a YouTube video, which means the company can use embeds to plant ads or collect user information. ""We've certainly thought about it, whether it's data or it's advertising,"" Peters says, even if those features aren’t part of the initial rollout. The digital shift has been hard on photographers The clear comparison is the music industry, which was hit hard by piracy in the '90s and took decades to respond. ""Before there was iTunes, before there was Spotify, people were put in that situation where they were basically forced to do the wrong thing, sharing files,"" Peters says. Now, if an aspiring producer wants to leak a song to the web but keep control of it, they can drop it on Soundcloud. Any blog can embed the player, and the artist can disable it whenever they want. And as Google has proved with YouTube, it's easy to drop ads or ""buy here"" links into that embed. ""We've seen what YouTube's done with monetizing their embed capabilities,"" Peters says. ""I don't know if that's going to be appropriate for us or not."" But as long as the images are being taken as embeds rather than free-floating files, the company will have options. Embeds have enabled a new kind of link rot Getty Images' profits haven't cratered like music conglomerates: its profits actually increased nearly $100 million from 2007 to 2011, thanks in part to digital licensing. Still, the digital shift has been hard on photographers, with professional stipends increasingly replaced by smaller payments to amateur or freelance photographers. Part of Peters' promise is that the new embeds will open up larger flows of money down the road. The biggest effect might be on the nature of the web itself. Embeds from Twitter and YouTube are already a crucial part of the modern web, but they've also enabled a more advanced kind of link rot, as deleted tweets and videos leave holes in old blog posts. If the new embeds take off, becoming a standard for low-rent WordPress blogs, they'll extend that webby decay to the images themselves. On an embed-powered web, a change in contracts could leave millions of posts with no lead image, or completely erase a post like this one. Still, such long-term effects are years away, if they happen at all. In the meantime, Getty Images is focused on the more immediate problem of infringement. ""The principle is to turn what's infringing use with good intentions, turning that into something that's valid licensed use with some benefits going back to the photographer,"" says Peters, ""and that starts really with attribution and a link back.""",0.4515643446071175,0.5484356553928825,0.17985149901548605,848,4.8007075471698117,447,6.0111856823266221,0,0,"Business, Policy & Law, Web, Report",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

Loudcloud, the early cloud-computing company Horowitz founded with Marc Andreessen after the sale of Netscape to AOL, nearly went bankrupt when the NASDAQ crashed in 2000. When fundraising proved impossible, Horowitz pursued a controversial initial public offering that BusinessWeek called ""the IPO from hell."" The business that emerged from Loudcloud’s assets, Opsware, was another journey through hell. When Horowitz finally unloaded Opsware on Hewlett-Packard — for $1.65 billion in cash — he felt more sick than he did relieved. ""I couldn’t sleep, I had cold sweats, I threw up, and I cried,"" he writes in a new book. A few years later, Horowitz decided to do it all over again, starting Andreessen Horowitz with Netscape founder Marc Andreessen.  ""I couldn't sleep, I had cold sweats, I threw up, and I cried."" Fortunately for Horowitz, his next startup has had a smoother road to success. In four years, Andreessen Horowitz has raised $2.5 billion and made successful investments in Groupon, Zynga, Instagram, and Skype, which all went public or were acquired for billions. Their current portfolio includes high-profile startups Airbnb, Box, Jawbone, Lyft, and Pinterest, among others. Along the way, Horowitz garnered attention for his blog posts about entrepreneurship, which he has collected and expanded in a new book, The Hard Thing About Hard Things: Building A Business When There Are No Easy Answers. It’s a candid, sometimes melodramatic take on startup life where complete failure is never more than one bad decision away. We sat down with Horowitz in his firm’s Menlo Park offices to talk about the dot-com crash, why profanity produces results, and where he finds the new rap lyrics that serve as epigraphs for his blog posts. So, in your book, LoudCloud and Opsware come across as businesses that were never more than a few days away from collapse. Was it really all that bad? ""I'm literally the IPO from hell."" Ben Horowitz: Oh yeah. Actually, if you go back and read the stories — sometimes I read them and it seems worse. On the IPO roadshow, BusinessWeek wrote a story: ""The IPO from Hell."" And I can’t tell you how public-market investors were looking at me when I’m literally the IPO from hell. At the same time, you also make a full-throated defense of the businesses, which you did take public and eventually sell for more than $1 billion. Have you been itching to set the record straight? I don’t know about set it straight so much as describe it. Because it started as one of these things where everyone was like, they’re definitely dead. And then when it succeeded, people were like, ""Wow, how did that happen?"" I got a call from a private equity firm after we sold the company. They said Ben, we’re calling because we want you to join our firm. I was like, why would you want me in private equity? They were like no, no, no: Loudcloud to Opsware was the greatest turnaround in the last 20 years of tech. And I said, well you are aware that I’m the one who fucked it up in the first place? Do you think you fucked it up? Yeah, I mean, look — this is the terror of being a founder / CEO. It is all your fault. Every decision, every person you hire, every dumb thing you buy or do — ultimately you’re at the end. A CEO’s supposed to take into account things like macroeconomic environment. At that point I had no idea — it was completely unfathomable to me that NASDAQ would drop 80 percent while I was CEO, or things would go from ""money is free!"" to ""there’s no money at all, fuck you."" I didn’t anticipate, and I got us in trouble. And then I wasn’t a very good CEO, to be quite honest with you. I tried hard but I wasn’t good at it. It took me a while to learn the job. Given the challenges you faced, how much of the final sale price for Opsware do you ascribe to skill, and how much to luck? ""Had a couple things gone the other way, we would have gone bankrupt."" I think there was a lot of both. On the luck side, there’s no question that had a couple things gone the other way, we would have gone bankrupt. On the other hand, it’s hard to imagine a company having worse luck than we had: starting in ’99 in the cloud-computing business. But at the end, Opsware was a really good company. If you talk to the guys who competed with us, they hated seeing us on an account. And that part took a lot of skill. You once faced an employee revolt over how much you’ve cursed at the office. Are you cursing less these days?  What do you think, Grace? Grace Ellis, Andreessen Horowitz public relations: No. Horowitz: Opsware was just a blue streak. You know, I’m a huge believer in clarity. As long as people are clear on what they need to do and what’s going on, you’re very likely to succeed. When nobody is clear, then you’re guaranteed to fail. And profanity helps clarity. Or at least, I haven’t found a better way to get to clarity. If I have one skill as a manager, I can make things extremely clear. The book uses a lot of war terminology; there are boxing photographs here on the wall. At one point you lament that you can’t award promotions based on executives’ fighting ability. Are you drawn to conflict as a person? I don’t know that I’m drawn to conflict; you don't necessarily in these businesses want conflict with other companies, though you get it a fair amount. But, and this is one of the best management pieces of advice I ever got from Marc Andreessen: he was quoting Lenin, who was quoting Karl Marx, who said: ""sharpen the contradictions."" Marx was talking about labor and capital, which is not generally what you’re talking about when you’re running a company. But the conflict is where the truth is. And so when there’s a conflict in the organization, you do not want to smooth it over. You want to sharpen the contradictions, heat up both opinions, and resolve it. Good CEOs are really good at doing that. And it’s miserable to work for someone who tries to smooth things over. ""Oh no, it’s a miscommunication."" Miscommunication? I don't agree with that, motherfucker! ""I don't agree with that, motherfucker!"" The book has less to say about lessons you’ve learned since starting Andreessen Horowitz. Is that because you’re still learning? I don’t think I’m in any position to write a book on how to be a venture capitalist. I’m certainly still learning. And I kind of spent my whole life learning how to write The Hard Thing About Hard Things. That was a lifetime’s worth of experience. The main thing was just the way to think about a startup. I definitely have sharper thinking on that than I did the first time, when I’d never done it before. You like to sprinkle a lot of rap lyrics in your writing. Where do you find new music to listen to? A combination of things. I’ve got a lot of friends who are pretty deep into music, so I get a lot of stuff from them. There’s a couple of internet hip-hop stations that are good: Underground Hip-Hop and New Hip-Hop First. I listen to the Sirius Radio one, XL Hip Hop, and then Rap Genius has the new stuff that breaks and I get stuff off there. Those are my primary sources. Sometimes Spotify will show me something, but usually I’ve already seen it by the time they figure out I want to see it. You’re donating all the proceeds from your book to the American Jewish World Service, and its fight for women’s rights globally. Why?  ""If you educate a girl, you educate five people."" Well one, the organization itself is super well run. It’s run by Ruth Messinger, who used to be president of Manhattan. She’s just a dynamo. But women’s rights — there are parts of the world where women are not free. They’re not technically slaves, but they don’t have self-determination, they don’t have control over their own lives, they don’t have a right to education. The AWJS has a statistic that says if you educate a girl, you’re very likely to educate five people. And if you educate a boy, you may educate one — but he’s definitely not educating anybody else. You have to have women’s rights so you can have literacy, so you can have education, so you can have democracy, so you can fight terrorism and everything else. So geopolitically, it’s maybe the most important thing. If I wasn’t working, it’s certainly what I would spend on my time on. I think I’m probably more effective providing money — just because I’m good at making money, at this point.",0.475136948287074,0.524863051712926,0.21137454518906204,1527,4.656843483955468,720,5.9833333333333334,0,0,"Business, Tech, 5 Minutes on The Verge, Interview",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

The sophisticated attack was launched during the popular Black Friday shopping weekend and stretched on for three weeks.

The programmer and Native American activist Payu Harris raised a gavel Monday night and vigorously banged the bell to open trading at The Bitcoin Center, a meeting space for virtual currency geeks that looks like an empty art gallery in the middle of New York’s Financial District. Harris was there to promote MazaCoin, a cousin of Bitcoin that is now the official currency of the seven bands that make up the Lakota nation. After an hour of questions, Harris thanked the small crowd and was promptly accosted by a tall man and a woman in red who wanted to buy some MazaCoin, which Harris was selling for 10 cents apiece. The two trailed him around the room as he hunted for a printer so he could issue the digital currency on paper. MazaCoin is a month-old cryptocurrency based on the same proof-of-work algorithm as Bitcoin, the virtual currency that approximates cash on the internet — but no one in the room was equipped to make a digital trade. There have been a slew of copycats since the rise of Bitcoin in 2009. The first wave attempted to improve on the basic Bitcoin protocol. The second wave, which includes the meme-based Dogecoin and the Icelandic Auroracoin, are catering to specific groups. Since the rise of Bitcoin, there have been a slew of copycats MazaCoin was developed by an anonymous cryptographer who had built a new implementation of the Bitcoin protocol and was looking for a good cause to associate it with, Harris says. Anyone can buy or sell the currency, but the Lakota are keeping half of it in reserve in order to prevent the wild speculation that has caused Bitcoin such price volatility. Harris has also had inquiries from other tribes that want to use the currency or start their own. Currencies knit communities together. Having one’s own currency is empowering; the Latvian 5-lat coin, nicknamed ""Milda"" for the woman in traditional clothing depicted on it, became a symbol of Latvian independence during the Soviet occupation. A dedicated currency also boosts economic activity within a community, the impetus behind the (questionably legal) hyperlocal currency movement that has produced alternative monies such as BerkShares, IthacaHours, and the Brooklyn Torch. Tribes using MazaCoin automatically make it easier to spend money at the local reservation general store than changing it into dollars to spend at Walmart, for example. But perhaps more than that, it will give the Lakota people a sense of unity and independence. ""Our tribe has an idea of what sovereignty is, but not at a level like the Ukrainians,"" Harris says, referring to the fierce battle for democracy taking place there. ""There is no sense of national identity."" ""We're on sovereign soil so we have the right to have Bitcoin, Litecoin, MazaCoin."" That fragmentation contributes to the tribes’ crippling dependency on the US government. Half the tribal members on Harris’s reservation, the Oglala Lakota Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota, live in poverty. It’s a problem that afflicts tribes across the country as Native Americans have grown dependent on federal welfare after being ghettoized on reservations. Roughly $220 million flows through the reservation every year, through the Prairie Wind casino and other venues, according to Harris. But he estimates less than $45 million of that stays in the local economy. With MazaCoin, he hopes to stop that money from flowing back to Rapid City and out of the state. ""We’re building a new economic foundation for the reservation,"" he says. The US Treasury Department has indicated that Bitcoin is legal but carries certain bookkeeping requirements related to money transmission. At the same time, some politicians are calling for a ban on the currency. Harris is hoping to avoid all that with MazaCoin. Federal laws granting Native Americans special legal status provide an argument for a currency totally independent of the US dollar. Native American sovereignty is legally defined over a patchwork of treaties, laws, and precedent. ""We're on sovereign soil so we have the right to have Bitcoin, Litecoin, MazaCoin,"" Harris says. But Chase Iron Eyes, South Dakota legal counsel for the Lakota, believes the federal government will push back if MazaCoin succeeds. ""There hasn’t been a tribal nation that has declared its own currency and has mandated that that currency is used within its borders,"" Iron Eyes says. ""But it’s because of this pervasive, ever-present asserted dominion of the United States. They’ll try to shut us down, try to cite us with law violations.""  While the leadership of the Lakota nation has signed off on adopting MazaCoin as a national currency, there is resistance within the ranks. Digital currencies are not always an easy sell, especially to older generations who are not accustomed to using apps constantly throughout the day. A further complication is that not all tribal members have internet access or smartphones, which means Harris has to develop a paper wallet system where members’ MazaCoins are held in cold storage at a central location like a bank. In theory members can walk into the bank, get their MazaCoins in a paper wallet that can be processed by reservation businesses, then return the balance to digital storage at the bank before driving home. There is also a fear of letting go of the US dollar, which holds the implicit threat of letting go of the federal subsidies denominated in it. Iron Eyes believes the legal battle and the public perception battle are worth fighting. ""We’ve gone through 100 years of imposed poverty. That’s the fight we’re having,"" he says. ""What we’re trying to do with MazaCoin is just spark something to get us out of this cycle of victimhood.""",0.5067293490034211,0.49327065099657885,0.8926055017966782,962,5.0654885654885655,509,6.355599214145383,0,0,"Business, Policy & Law, US & World, Report",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

Last night more than 80,000 viewers watched Masri's stream, until his phone was stolen. He's searching for a replacement, but keep your eyes peeled on his Ustream channel. There are also a number of other people providing live streams intermittently; you can keep tabs on which streams are popular on Livestream. Twitter has proven itself as one of the most powerful platforms for observing events of major importance as they happen live. If you're a pro, you probably already know where to look. But if you're not a user already, don't worry: you can sign up anonymously, make a private profile, and simply observe what's happening in the world. Here's a list of 40 people on the ground in Ferguson to get you started. Tweetdeck If you've got a web browser you need to use Tweetdeck. It's more powerful than using Twitter's traditional website which restricts you to a single column of information, and new tweets stream continuously. It's free. Surfing the stream Use search terms in Tweetdeck columns to keep track of of certain topics and conversations. Tonight, you need to watch the hashtag #shutitdown. Some hashtags and keywords, like #Ferguson, may be unreadable in Tweetdeck — in that case you're better off looking for the top tweets on Twitter's regular website.     Instagram can also provide a broad and immediate look at events. Images are being posted under the same hashtags: #shutitdown and #Ferguson.

They also say it will become exceedingly useful on smaller gadgets like smartwatches, where space comes at a premium. Still, the change doesn't mean certain gadgets can go out into the world naked.

United States, the first case about online threats to reach the highest level of judicial review. It’s a timely case, coinciding with increased attention around the online harassment of women—from Caroline Criado-Perez to Zoë Quinn and the other women targeted by Gamergate. The case has the potential to broadly change what kind of online speech can be prosecuted. The case centers on Anthony Elonis, who was convicted after writing graphic, gory fantasies about mutilating and killing his wife and other women and posting them to Facebook. The issue before the Supreme Court is whether ""a true threat"" requires finding that the threatener subjectively intended to be threatening. Elonis is arguing for a subjective intent requirement, claiming that his posts were meant as rap lyrics and not as threats, while the prosecutors are arguing for an ""objective"" standard—a threat counts as a threat if a ""reasonable person"" would think the statement is a threat. Who is the ""reasonable person""? The government is arguing that it’s enough to use an objective standard, with an exception for ""idle or careless talk, exaggeration, something said in a joking manner or an outburst of transitory anger."" However, when it comes to the Internet, where context or tone may be more difficult to perceive, this objective standard has obvious drawbacks: is the ""reasonable person"" going to be a teenager who plays League of Legends or a grandfather posting on a fly fishing forum? Some fear that if the Supreme Court takes the government’s side in Elonis, it could open the door to a flood of prosecutions over careless Internet postings. See, for example, the League of Legends player who ""threatened"" to shoot up a kindergarten (allegedly followed by a ""J/K"" and ""LOL""). The person who reported the post read it in a different context from the League of Legends players who regularly hurl abusive language at each other. It’s not hard to imagine this becoming a regular occurrence if an objective standard is applied to the Internet. And in this particular case, it’s hard to see a downside if the Supreme Court goes in the opposite direction—a subjective intent requirement is not in itself a significant setback in protecting Internet users against dangerous people online. It could open the door to a flood of prosecutions over careless Internet postings Elonis v. United States shows a stark division between the US and Europe when it comes to speech. In general, European countries have broader prohibitions against speech, particularly when it comes to hate speech. Three people were recently jailed in the UK for online harassment under a law that forbids electronic messages that are ""grossly offensive or of an indecent, obscene, or menacing character,"" and the British Parliament is currently considering harsher penalties. In the United States, the Supreme Court has interpreted the First Amendment to stop similar European-style prohibitions on hate speech, in cases like R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul (1992) and Virginia v. Black (2003). In R.A.V., the court overturned a conviction for burning a cross on an African-American family’s lawn, on First Amendment grounds. In Virginia v. Black, again, a conviction for cross-burning was overturned. But Virginia v. Black was written in a confusing, meandering way with concurrences that split off in many directions. Although the Supreme Court held that the mere act of a burning a cross was not always evidence of a threat, the court also found that cross-burning could be restricted if it was done ""with the intent to intimidate."" The context was key. ""This is the standard with virtually every other crime: whether the defendant intended to cause harm."" In a way, Virginia v. Black makes perfect sense. Madonna’s music video for ""Like A Prayer"" is clearly not a threat against anyone. At the same time, if someone wearing a white gown with a pointed hood burns a cross on the lawn of an African-American family, it’s fairly obvious that that is a threat. A law that doesn’t allow room to distinguish between those two cases shouldn’t be constitutionally permissible. But the way Virginia v. Black was written wasn’t clear enough for judges in the lower courts. In particular, the court didn’t issue a clear definition of a ""true threat."" (The decision describes true threats as ""forms of intimidation that are most likely to inspire fear of bodily harm."") This was vague enough that different judicial interpretations popped up across the country—hence, Elonis being heard before the Supreme Court. Online threats run afoul of the law against ""transmitting in interstate commerce communications containing threats to injure another person."" Lower courts have split on whether to apply the objective standard, or to require subjective intent. The objective standard resembles legal standards for civil tort liability—so for example, a corporation doesn’t have to intend to cause an oil spill before it can be sued in court. In contrast, the interpretation requiring ""subjective"" intent more closely resembles traditional legal standards in the criminal law, a point the American Civil Liberties Union repeatedly makes in its brief to the Supreme Court. Lee Rowland, an attorney with the ACLU, emphasized, ""This is the standard with virtually every other crime: whether the defendant intended to cause harm. If you really think that there’s a fire in a theater, and you yell fire, you haven’t committed a crime, even if there’s no fire."" It’s important to note that the ""subjective intent"" at issue isn’t a question of whether Elonis actually intended to cut his wife until her ""body is a mess, soaked in blood and dying,"" it’s whether Elonis intended to make his wife afraid. And finding subjective intent isn’t a matter of reading a defendant’s mind or going through his diary. As with the cross-burning cases, the context is what the jury must look to. And here, the context is fairly damning.  As with the cross-burning cases, the context is what the jury must look to. And here, the context is fairly damning.  In 2010, Anthony Elonis’ wife left him and took the children. Almost immediately he began acting erratically. After a fellow employee filed multiple sexual harassment complaints against him, he posted a vague threat against her on Facebook, resulting in him getting fired the very same day. From there, things only got worse. He made creepy Facebook comments about his children and his wife and then began to write long, bizarre rap songs as Facebook posts. His wife testified at trial that during their marriage, Elonis rarely listened to rap music, and had certainly never shown any interest in writing rap lyrics. Elonis claimed to find inspiration in Eminem’s ""Guilty Conscience,"" ""Kill You, Criminal,"" and ""97 Bonnie and Clyde."" The resemblance to Eminem’s music is there, though maybe only insofar as the songs are all about violently murdering his wife. His posts often referenced the First Amendment and free speech, graphically describing the mutilation and murder of his wife while gleefully claiming it was all only a joke. In response to his wife acquiring a protection-from-abuse order, he wrote, ""Fold up your PFA and put it in your pocket. Is it thick enough to stop a bullet?"" At the end of that post, he linked out to the Wikipedia article for ""Freedom of Speech."" About a month after he had been fired from his job, Elonis posted: I’m checking out and making a name for myself Enough elementary schools in a ten mile radius to initiate the most heinous school shooting ever imagined And hell hath no fury like a crazy man in a kindergarten class The only question is . . . which one? It was still two years prior to Sandy Hook, but regardless, the FBI showed up at Elonis’ door. When he answered, he politely asked if he was free to go. They confirmed that he was, and he closed the door on them. Shortly afterwards, he posted on his Facebook: You know your shit’s ridiculous When you have the FBI knockin’ at yo door Little Agent Lady stood so close Took at the strength I had not to the turn the bitch ghost Pull my knife, flick my wrist, and slit her throat Leave her bleedin’ from her jugular in the arms of her partner At this point, Elonis was arrested and charged with ""transmitting in interstate commerce communications containing threats to injure another person,"" and ultimately convicted by a jury. His posts graphically described the murder of his wife while gleefully claiming it was all only a joke The facts of Elonis are fascinating as a cultural marker. The same defenses implied in his posts— ""I’m just joking"" and ""it’s free speech""—have become tired tropes in debates about sexism online. Even though Elonis is less about faceless trolls attacking female public figures and more about intimate partner violence, it’s easy to look at the case and see similarities to the experiences of Anita Sarkeesian, Zoë Quinn, Adria Richards, Kathy Sierra, and others. (And it’s also important to remember that the abuse of Quinn cannot be separated from intimate partner violence, as it was instigated by an angry ex-boyfriend). Adoption of the objective test might, at a cursory glance, seem like a boon to anti-harassment advocates, since it gives greater leeway to law enforcement. But the point of view of the ""reasonable person,"" not the subjective intent requirement, has been the real stumbling block in getting the law to take violence against women seriously. Whether it’s with respect to Internet harassment, stalking, or intimate partner violence, ""objective"" standards have leaned away from reading malice or danger in abusers’ actions, even when victims are both fearful and in the best position to know their own abusers’ minds. The cultural change precipitated by these events will change how either test is applied But high-profile incidents like the ongoing Gamergate controversy are changing how we as a society understand cases like Elonis. From the Hollaback catcalling video to the Santa Barbara spree killings, something is shifting about the public perception of the systemic disadvantages and dangers that women face. Are catcalls really complimentary? Are forum posts about hating women really harmless, empty rantings? What counts as dangerous? What counts as ""not real""? And is all of this connected? In the words of one of Anita Sarkeesian’s detractors, ""My biggest problem with Anita, is that if I used her logic, I would see sexism everywhere."" ""I will say one thing about the Internet—it’s really transformative,"" says Soraya Chemaly, a media critic who frequently writes about gender. ""It’s really brought these issues into people’s lives. [The Internet has] pulled away the curtain, and it’s made it easier for us to say: ‘This happens all the time. This is what women are living with in their homes, or on their computer, or in the classroom, or on the street.’ And we’ve never been able to do that before. It’s really a powerful thing."" As jury boxes begin to fill with men and women who have witnessed online harassment against their friends, or have seen the studies, or read the newspaper articles, they will bring that context with them. Just as the context of American history informs a jury on when a cross-burning is a threat, the awareness that one-third of all female homicides are committed by their intimate partners will inform a jury on how to understand the subjective intent behind a Facebook post by an estranged husband. Either possible decision in Elonis can’t and won’t solve the high-profile online harassment documented in the media. But the cultural change precipitated by these events will change how the test—whichever one the Court settles on—is applied in practice.",0.6154275531257005,0.3845724468742995,0.8285336995941441,1959,5.1184277692700357,905,6.5635359116022096,0,0,"Culture, US & World, Report",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

For this year's Skylanders: Superchargers, which is set for release September 20th for pretty much every console and iPad, it's cars. And motorcycles. And boats. Also tanks, helicopters, jets, submarines, and more. As with previous Skylanders titles, players ""import"" playable characters into the game by placing physical figurines on a plastic ""Portal of Power"" connected to the console. The game itself is very tongue-in-cheek action / platformer (the Big Evil Weapon here is called the “Doomstation of Ultimate Doomstruction”) that involves a lot of running around and solving small puzzles or fighting bad people. The world is colorful, and the collectibles are plenty. All previous Skylanders figurines are compatible — just place them on the portal and go crazy — but the real draw here of course are the 20 new vehicles and 20 new ""SuperChargers"" figurines. The vehicles themselves vary, but they all fall into one of three categories: land, sea, and air. The game has specific levels designed for each category, and no there's no intermingling — you can zip through a water-centric level in a jet, for example. The new Portal of Power has enough room for both character and vehicle, and each character has a signature vehicle that, when paired, creates a ""SuperCharged Combo."" (Get it?) Additionally, each vehicle has several customizations you can collect as you play. In a meeting with publisher Activision and developer Vicarious Vision, I got to check out three vehicles in action: Hot Streak, a racecar; Sky Slicer, a jet; and Dive Bomber, a submarine. The physical toys themselves matched past Skylanders in style and color. They were fairly sturdy and had moving parts like the wheels and propeller. (The representatives stressed that the toys and Portal we saw were not final products.) Unfortunately, we weren't allowed to play the game ourselves, so while I can say it looks fun, I really won't know until some actual hands-on playtime. Skylanders: SuperChargers is coming out September 20th to virtually every console from the last two generations: PlayStation 4, PS3, Xbox One, Xbox 360, Nintendo Wii U, and iPad — the Nintendo Wii and 3DS will ""have a different, complementary experience."" A Starter Pack costs $74.99 and comes with three figurines: Hot Streak car, its signature driver Spitfire, and a ""SuperCharged"" variant of classic figure Stealth Elf (the 3DS Starter Pack will be $10 cheaper). Additional characters will cost $12.99 and vehicles $14.99. You don't have to buy the Starter Pack, though: for the first time in the series, ""connected consoles"" and select iPads will be able to buy and download a digital copy and ""complete the mainline game"" with a virtual (read: no physical figurine required) Spitfire character / Hot Streak vehicle — and again, previous portals and characters are compatible here.",0.5556386102906348,0.44436138970936523,0.19791359334851907,501,5.2035928143712571,322,6.0683229813664594,0,14,"Culture, Entertainment, Gaming",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

My favorite game was “Sarlacc Pit,” in which I would hang onto the top of the stairs and pretend to be pulled down into the depths of the sandy beast where I would slowly be digested over the course of 1,000 years (or until it was time for dinner). There was something simple and satisfying about physically re-enacting those scenes, and while video games eventually came to dominate my free time, quick-twitch and puzzle games never pushed the same buttons as simply recreating my favorite movie moments.   Today Disney announced Playmation, its new toy line that will be launching later this year, and at first glimpse I thought it was something similar to Disney Infinity: a mash-up of physical product and video game that, while interesting, was something we’d all certainly seen before. Then I got a chance to try it out, and now the 10-year-old inside me is flipping out. I used what is essentially the Disney Playmation starter kit, which includes the Iron Man “repulsor” arm piece, two base stations (called “power activators” in Playmation parlance), and two action figures: Captain America and the villainous Iron Skull. I slid my arm into the repulsor arm piece, tightened it down to a snug fit, then tried a few of the weapon options at my disposal. My thumb triggered a laser hit, while holding up my palm and sliding the lower half of the arm piece shot off a repulsor blast. When I say “shot off,” I mean the repulsor arm piece made an appropriate sound and slightly vibrated to make it seem like I was doing something. It was simple but surprisingly satisfying. But that’s a boring, one-off action out of context — what was fun is when you actually have to perform a mission. Given that it’s primarily aimed at kids, Disney first demoed the product for journalists with, you know, an actual kid playing it. That mission was a battle in the jungles of Wakanda (Marvel fans, you know what that is; everybody else, it doesn’t matter). The two power activator stations served as both the source of “bad guys” and also a place where the player could perform additional activities like set explosions. The voice of JARVIS set up the mission for the player, and she walked around the demo room — decorated as a kid’s bedroom —  as she “explored” the jungle. The power activators were able to track her motion through the room via IR, and when the sound alert came that villains had spotted her, she jumped behind the bed to shield herself from the attacks, and popped up to fire blasts at the bad guys, which were represented by color-changing lights on the stations.    To complete the mission, she had to take down multiple bad guys, then set an explosive at the station. The voice narrating the mission warned her to clear the blast radius — she actually had to physically leave the room to avoid taking damage — and after she’d finished the arm piece, it let her know how she’d done and that she earned a power-up (in this case, a freeze blast).  Afterwards she was able to sync up with the mobile app, which provides a secondary means of tracking progress, comparing scores with friends and downloading additional missions. But rather than being the heart of the experience, the mobile app is an add-on that seems almost superfluous — the joy seemed to be clearly in the physical play, not staring at an iPad. But just to make completely sure, I volunteered to try Playmation myself. My mission was to fight Iron Skull, so they brought out the Iron Skull figure and placed him on top of one of the power activator stations. I had my brief weapons training, and the mission kicked off. I shot at Iron Skull; the power activator flashed red to signify a hit. Before he could strike back, I hit him with a repulsor blast. Then the color of the activator changed again, signifying that he was getting ready to fire. I tapped a button on the arm piece, activating my shield, and turned my arm around. That’s when I surprised myself, dropping to my knees to hide behind the protective force field.      It was immediate, instinctual, tapping directly into some primitive kid-brain where playing make-believe is as automatic as breathing. I might as well have been hanging off those stairs again, warning Han Solo to aim just a little higher.  When I finally beat Iron Skull, the power activator popped up, knocking the figure off its perch. The game congratulated me on my victory, telling me it was the quickest Iron Skull had ever been defeated. Was it lying? Probably. Did my 10-year-old self care? Not at all. Disney Playmation goes up for preorder on July 7th, with the product shipping and hitting stores this October (Bruce Banner fans can pick up a set with Hulk gloves in November), and I can’t say this is something I’d buy myself. The repulsor arm piece is just small enough to remind you that it’s intended primarily for kids, and I don’t know how much my girlfriend would love me running around the living room and hiding behind the couch so I don’t get shot by some mysterious Marvel villain. But for kids — or parents — that want to augment “playing superheroes” with some great props and clever missions, there’s an awful lot to like about what Disney and Hasbro are doing here: enhancing play in the physical space, instead of replacing it with a computer screen. Of course, Playmation for Star Wars is coming next year, and if there are lightsabers involved I won’t be responsible for my actions.",0.5186932832911884,0.48130671670881164,0.5164569161642372,1000,4.6509999999999998,516,5.916666666666667,0,30,"Culture, Entertainment, Gaming, Hands-on",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Blizzard’s digital take on card games took what always felt to me like an overly complex genre, and streamlined it so that basically anyone could play; matches were quick, rules easy to understand, and most importantly it was fun from the very beginning, while still offering deep and engaging strategy. I play the game almost every day, and I’m not the only one who has found myself addicted: earlier this year Blizzard revealed that Hearthstone had more than 30 million players.  Now it’s trying to do the same for MOBAs — short for multiplayer online battle arena — the competitive strategy genre that has exploded in popularity thanks to games like League of Legends and Dota 2. With Heroes of the Storm, which launched this week, Blizzard appears to have done just that: it’s a game that cuts out much of what makes the genre so intimidating, while keeping everything that makes it so fun.  And just like Hearthstone, it’s a game that has managed to lure me into an addictive new world. MOBAs are the most popular genre of competitive games in the world. League of Legends has close to 70 million players, while competitor Dota 2 has around 10 million. The games are the focus of major tournaments that feature multi-million-dollar prize pools, and Dota 2 was featured on the front page of The New York Times. But for all of their popularity and mainstream acceptance, MOBAs can be incredibly unwelcoming to newcomers. Even the name sounds hardcore. They’re kind of like real-time strategy games (think Starcraft) crossed with basketball. Two teams of five players do battle, each attempting to destroy the other’s base. Sounds simple, but there are all kinds of strategic wrinkles to master. For starters, just picking who to play as is a challenge: League of Legends has more than a hundred characters, each with their own distinct playstyles to master. Meanwhile, in-game chats are filled with all kinds of complex jargon, and other players will often expect you to be a master even when you’ve just started out. It’s not the best system for easing in new players, and it’s the reason why people spend literally thousands of hours trying to master these games. It takes a lot of time and work to get to the point where it’s actually fun. But with Heroes of the Storm, it only took a handful of matches before I understood the appeal. Much of what Heroes does is simply reduce the complexity inherent to the genre. The current cast of hero characters is relatively small, for example, making choosing one no more difficult than picking between Ryu and Ken in Street Fighter. (The cast is also a mash-up of characters from Blizzard games like Diablo and Starcraft, making this a bit like Blizzard’s own version of Super Smash Bros.) Similarly, the matches are significantly shorter than in other MOBAs; whereas games of League can go on for an hour, my longest Heroes match so far was around 20 minutes. For an online game that you can’t pause, length can be a huge sticking point. And the changes go well beyond that. One of the unique aspects of MOBAs is how your character levels up over the course of a match. You can earn new upgrades and abilities to customize your fighter, and since these reset after each match, this lets you experiment with different strategies each time you play. But it can also be very confusing. In League, for instance, you can earn gold to spend at a shop to buy items that augment and upgrade your existing skills. But for newcomers it’s not really clear what these items do, and since you’re buying things in the middle of a match — when the clock is ticking and people are trying to kill you — it’s hard to make an informed decision. Heroes, on the other hand, simply lets you pick from a handful of new abilities when you hit a specific experience level; you know exactly what you’re getting at a glance, and the process of choosing them is simple and intuitive. Heroes also makes some changes to the levels you’ll be playing in. MOBA maps are essentially all the same: they consist of three lanes with each team’s base on either side. Along those lanes are barriers and defenses you’ll need to break through in order to destroy the other team’s stronghold. The maps in Heroes are similarly laid out, but each includes some kind of gameplay twist that’s almost like a secondary objective. In one stage you can gather up gems to give as an offering to a spider queen, and the team that gathers the most will gain the temporary help of a huge monster. Each level has a different twist; they are all hugely helpful and can often change the outcome of a match. It’s like if in basketball one team was allowed to have a sixth player on the floor for just one minute. Of course, these changes won’t appeal to everyone. The simplified character progression system will likely be too limited for hardcore MOBA fans, and the unique objectives for each map remove some of the purity of the game, putting a big emphasis on AI-controlled bonus characters. And just like Hearthstone, and Nintendo’s new shooter Splatoon, Heroes has no voice chat. This was never a problem for me — there’s text chat and a feature that lets you call for help if you need it — but it’s a fixture of MOBAs, making it easy to organize strategies on the fly. But it’s also part of the reason these games tend to have infamously toxic communities, so for some people the silence is a relief. I don’t really want to listen to someone yelling at me while I’m trying to learn a complex new game. There are definitely features that hardcore MOBA fans will scoff at, but for everyone else — those who, like me, find the genre a bit too intimidating — Heroes is an amazing entry point. What Hearthstone is to Magic the Gathering, Heroes is to League of Legends and Dota 2. And while it’s different and streamlined, that doesn’t mean it’s lacking in depth. You still need to spend lots time trying different characters to master them, and figuring out the intricacies of each level requires a lot of practice. After playing for more than a week, I still can’t decide if I prefer to play as a support character or a long-range assassin, and it’s going to take a long while before I figure out which one better suits the way I play. The difference is that, unlike other MOBAs, the learning process is a whole lot of fun.

They would ensconce us in a safe environment where each new product bearing a storied name maintains the quality and care that have made that name famous. But in the real world, we have Apple making both the iPhone and the EarPods, Adobe responsible for both Photoshop and Flash, and Leica putting its iconic red dot on rebadged Panasonic cameras. Brands are unreliable. Marshall is precisely the sort of turncoat brand that we should all be wary of. Having established itself as an icon of live rock music with its unique guitar amplifiers, the company recently decided to make some extra cash on the side by selling its name to a small Swedish outfit by the name of Zound Industries. All of a sudden, Marshall headphones and Bluetooth speakers started showing up, accompanied by the tattooed arms of their supposed rock legend users. It was cheap and exploitative, and at first it was just a terrible charade for awful products. The first set of Marshall-branded in-ear headphones was an unqualified disaster, both in its sound and design.  What Android needs today is more personality, not more performance But somewhere along this road to perdition, a detour was taken and the Marshall-Zound hookup headed toward redemption. The latest Marshall Mode earbuds are a terrific improvement on their predecessors and finally sound like something worthy of bearing the big M logo that adorns them. And this week we got the next stage in the evolution of Marshall as a brand for non-Marshall products: a smartphone called the London. It should have been a dead-on-arrival calamity — another big name to add to the sad tales of the rebadged Polaroid and Kodak phones — but it's subverted all prejudices and wowed us with a highly individualized and attractive design. What sets the Marshall London apart from the rest of the gimmicky crowd is that it's functionally, not just aesthetically, different. Its basic specs are unimpressive, but it has two headphone jacks for output and dual stereo microphones for recording. It has a professional Wolfson Audio sound card, a scroll wheel for a volume control, an ""M"" button for direct access to music, and yes, it even bundles in a pair of Marshall Modes. It's a music aficionado's phone that's designed for that purpose. The fact it's also embellished with brass accents and knurled sides that imitate Marshall's amps is just a bonus.  Zound has been talking up its smartphone plans for a few months ahead of this week's announcement, noting how boring and staid things have become and seeing an opportunity to add ""soft values"" with its own designs. That's the notion of addressing the unquantified needs and wishes of users: a phone that attracts attention without being kitsch, a device that does something materially, if not massively, different. Zound has sidestepped the endless spec race and created a lightning rod for attention simply by tapping into our imaginations and unexpressed desires. In spite of its mediocre specifications, the Marshall London has revitalized excitement around smartphones by being so clear-eyed and assertive in its purpose. Everyone can just look at it and understand why it exists. That cannot be validly said of the marginal upgrades introduced by the likes of HTC, LG, Sony, and Huawei this year. It's true that those big global brands have to cater to a broader market and therefore aim for a lower common denominator, but that doesn't mean they can't also show a bit of leadership by experimenting with wilder and more fascinating designs such as the London's. Their passivity is what's opening the door for Zound to steal the limelight. This phone has soul and style, but questions about its substance remain unanswered And yet, the London still represents a Faustian deal. Sure, you get the pleasure of having the ""turn it up to 11"" marque on your phone, but you get none of the audio expertise of the actual Marshall company. Maybe Zound and its partners have enough engineering acumen to make that unimportant, but then they also lack the infrastructure required to support a smartphone beyond the first few days after it's sold. What happens when Google releases Android M and the London needs to be updated across multiple countries and multiple carriers? The handset has a removable battery, but who's in charge of making sure there will be replacements available in a couple of years' time? Those are the unappreciated benefits of going with an established smartphone brand. Ultimately, this smartphone feels like one giant contradiction. It's disingenuous to just slap on the Marshall label when that company isn't involved in the engineering, and yet the London is far from some corporate copycat cash-in. Its design is thoughtful and understated, and its hardware additions are purposeful. It marries cynical marketing with sincere design. More than anything, though, it reminds us that smartphones can and should be exciting — it just takes a little bit more imagination and courage than everyone else is showing right now.",0.42446727374792564,0.5755327262520744,0.15675316791280514,856,5.02803738317757,479,6.3340292275574113,0,0,"Google, Mobile, Tech, Essay",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Neistat thinks he has the answer, though: he's built a new social media network named Beme (pronounced ""beam"") where users communicate with self-destructing videos recorded by placing their phones on their hearts. Well, that's not a necessity, but it's how Neistat demonstrates the iOS-only app, explaining that Beme uses the proximity sensor on the iPhone as a recording button. Cover that sensor up by placing your phone on your chest (or anywhere else for that matter) and Beme automatically records and uploads a 4-second clip of video. Beme wants badly to be authentic Removing the smartphone from its traditional location between you and the real world allows for a more authentic experience, claims Neistat. In the same vein, he says, Beme offers no chance to review or edit videos: they're just sent straight to users' feeds, which are themselves minimalist lists of recent uploads. Users click and hold on a video to watch it, and once it's been seen it's ""gone forever."" They can, however, give feedback by tapping the screen mid-video to send a selfie from their front-facing camera. ""Getting reactions is my favorite part of the app,"" says Neistat. ""There's just something so satisfying about being able to see people actually watching what you share."" Neistat has built a community online around his regularly updated YouTube channel, and he says he wants to do the same with Beme. So, instead of making the app freely available to all he's decided to use unlock codes to limit access. Anyone can download the app from iTunes but they'll need a code to use it. ""I will give [these] out periodically on the vlog or you can get one from anyone who's already unlocked the app,"" says Neistat underneath his YouTube introduction to Beme. However, it's hard not to see this approach as a way of also creating artificial buzz around the project, as well as perhaps limiting negative reaction while Beme is in its infancy. Neistat himself notes that the first version of the app is a ""hot mess,"" with an update scheduled for next week. His access code policy means that most of Beme's early-adopters are going to be those who already feel positively about Neistat because they follow him on social media.

The global average peak connection speed topped out at 29.1Mbps, with Singapore besting the world with a 98.5Mbps average peak speed. For comparison, the average US connection speed clocks in at just 11.9Mbps, while its average peak speed was just 53.3Mbps — neither of which is fast enough to put the US in the global top 10. Nevertheless, it helps explain why the Ookla speedo redlines at 50Mbps in the age 1000Mbps speeds. Increasingly, US citizens are gaining access to gigabit internet over fiber optic connections to the home. Google blazed the trail in 2012 by demonstrating demand for its Google Fiber service. Remember, it wasn’t so long ago that some misguided Time Warner Cable exec said that people didn’t want high-speed internet. Now we have gigabit services for the home offered by AT&T, CenturyLink, Cox, and even Comcast (if you can afford it). I’m fortunate to live in a city where homes and businesses have been wired with fiber internet for years. I’m currently enjoying TV, phone, and internet all over a sustained 200Mbps / 20Mbps connection for about $75 per month. Oh, was that boastful? Sorry, not sorry. Gigabit internet speeds remain a rarity, so say it loud and say it proud all you lucky subscribers to Google Fiber, Gigabit Pro, Gigablast, and 1Gig. Scream those speeds from the digital rooftops and bask in the likes and retweets as they rain down upon you. The more envy you create amongst your peers the more they’ll demand access to the same, helping to raise all boats in the water.  A picture of a man in a black shirt playing guitar, for example, is picked out as ""man in black shirt is playing guitar,"" while pictures of a black-and-white dog jumping over a bar, a man in a blue wetsuit surfing a wave, and little girl eating cake are also correctly described with a single sentence. In several cases, it's unnervingly accurate. There's no indication of what the press conference might entail, but there are some obvious possibilities: the first Model X deliveries are expected to start within the next few months, which means the company might finally unveil the production vehicle. The new iPod touch is just as thin (6.1mm) and light (88 grams) as the 2012 version, but it still feels impossibly light. Hollow, even. Inside the new iPod is a lot of the same stuff that makes the iPhone 6 perform so beautifully. Apple's added the 64-bit A8 processor for faster performance, and it shows. The X-Files is coming back early next year, and Fox just aired the most extensive footage yet during tonight's episode of Wayward Pines.

At my home office, I spend the vast majority of that time sitting. If I’m working in the New York office, I’m at a standing desk, which means I spend most of the day on my feet. Neither situation is ideal: numerous studies have shown the detrimental effects of too much sitting on our health, and many physicians and chiropractors (including my own) will tell you that standing on your feet all day isn’t great either.   The motorized, convertible standing desk lets you split time between standing and sitting in order to mitigate the detrimental effects of doing either for too long. A single button press can take you from a seated position to a standing mode in less than a minute. But despite the plethora of options in motorized standing desks and the popularity of them in the modern office, industry studies have shown that after a few weeks, most users don’t actually switch between the modes, leaving them with a fancy and expensive sitting desk.  That’s the problem that Stir is trying to solve with its own powered standing desks. The company released the M1 desk earlier this year, a less expensive version of the $4,000 F1 that came the year before it. Make no mistake, the M1 is still really expensive for a desk, and its $3,000 price tag puts it in the top price bracket of motorized standing desks. But Stir insists that its standing desks aren’t like any others because they are smarter, and they solve the problem of getting people to actually switch between standing and sitting modes.   I had the opportunity to test a white M1 in my home office for a few weeks, and it’s hard to come away from the experience unimpressed. That might have less to do with any of the M1’s smart capabilities and more to do with the fact that it’s just a far superior work station than the 10-plus-year-old rickety, metal-and-glass sitting desk that I’ve been using since my college days. (It’s also about 20 times the cost of that particular desk, so one would hope it’s better.) But while you can easily get a motorized standing desk for less than a third of the cost of the M1, there are a number of places where the desk justifies its cost. Almost. For starters, the finish on the surface of the desk is just sublime. Instead of metal, glass, or (shudder) particleboard, the M1’s desktop is made of CNC-machined recycled wood, which is then powdercoated with a smooth matte finish. The edges of the desk are softly rounded, and the contours beg you to rest your arms on them as you work. It’s a big desk, measuring about 30 inches deep by 60 inches wide (and there’s only one size option), and it has a lot of space for the various tools and accessories I keep on my desk during the work day. The M1 has a basic cable management system built in, including two cable trays, four built-in power outlets, and two long channels in the back to run wires through to your various devices. But none of that is particularly unique or different from the many other desks you can buy today. The real appeal with the M1 is in its smarts, which start with the 5-inch touchscreen controller embedded in the left side of the desktop. The controller is used to move the desk up and down, replacing the typical buttons found on many other standing desks. It also is used to connect the desk to your Wi-Fi network, display how long you’ve been standing or sitting, and even show the extra calories you’ve burned while standing. The M1 can also send its calorie data to a Fitbit, so all of those burned calories contribute to your overall fitness profile. A simple double tap on the display will start the M1 moving to either your preset sitting or standing position. It’s a quick and convenient way to change modes, unlike with other lesser desks, which require you to hold down a physical button to move them. (Or manual desks, which need to be cranked up or down.)   The smarts of the M1 further come into play with its scheduling and reminders system. Program the desk with how much of your day you’d like to be standing, and it will periodically remind you to switch positions. It’s not unlike the Apple Watch’s reminders to stand up or move around, except the M1 knows exactly when you’re standing and when you’re not without the failure rate of the Apple Watch. It does this by what the company calls ""Whisperbreath,"" where the desk moves up and down by half an inch to remind you it’s time to move, almost as if it’s alive and breathing. You can ignore these reminders or turn them off entirely, but they are very unobtrusive and I ended up looking forward to them coming every 45 minutes or so. It’s an original way to get users to actually move their desks after the novelty has worn off, and apparently it’s highly effective: Stir CEO JP Labrosse tells me that 95 percent of Stir desk owners change positions every day, as opposed to the industry average of 30 percent that move positions just once a week. Labrosse also says that owners spend 50 percent of their time standing, and change positions on average 3.4 times per day. During my time with the desk, I was pretty diligent in obeying its suggestions, switching positions roughly every 45 minutes. The M1 has other novel ideas that could potentially make it more than just a fancy desk. It has the ability to sense when you’re at your desk and when you’re not, which it currently uses to track your calorie burn. But since the M1 is connected to your Wi-Fi network, it could potentially act as the central hub of a smart office. It’s not hard to picture the desk automatically triggering lighting and climate control when you stand or sit at the desk and adjusting things accordingly when you get up and leave. The M1 doesn’t yet do any of these things, but Labrosse says the company is open to exploring similar ideas. Of course, all of this comes back to whether or not you need to spend three grand on the M1. The easy answer is no, you do not: you can replicate a lot of what makes the M1 special with a much cheaper desk and an egg timer. But if you spend most of your working day at a desk, the M1 is appealing not only because it is a smart desk that encourages you to move, but it’s also just a great space to work. If you do have $3,000 to spend on a desk, the M1 is a very good one, and it just might make you marginally healthier, too.

So budget-minded consumers often turn to prepaid carriers like MetroPCS, Straight Talk, Cricket, Virgin Mobile, and Boost to find a cellphone plan that isn't murder on their wallet. Picking one of the smaller companies over Verizon or AT&T can result in significant savings, but as Tom's Guide recently discovered, more affordable plans often come at the cost of speed. In a test that factored in multiple US cities, Tom's Guide found that prepaid carriers and MVNOs were often slower than the big four — even when sharing the same network. MetroPCS, which T-Mobile acquired in 2013, saw average download and upload speeds of 8.1 Mbps and 5.2 Mbps. The Uncarrier posted figures of 22.7 Mbps and 13.2 Mbps in the same six cities. But the slower speeds weren't universal; both carriers hit similar numbers in New York, though Tom's Guide believes its test was conducted at a time when T-Mobile wasn't dealing with heavy congestion. If that were the case, MetroPCS performance would've been handcuffed to give T-Mobile customers priority. T-Mobile doesn't try to hide this, with a representative saying the company gives its own customers ""data precedence over non-T-Mobile-branded services (including MetroPCS) when our network is presented with competing demands."" Apps can take longer to download Cricket is actually limited to a hard download cap of 8Mbps on AT&T's network, so the difference is a bit more cut and dry there. Obviously AT&T's network is capable of blowing past that limit, but getting better speeds means leaving attractive monthly plans behind.

Much has been said about the loss of bird, mammal, reptile, and amphibian species around the world. By current estimates, at least 322 species have gone extinct in the last 500 years. And researchers estimate that 16 to 33 percent of the world’s vertebrate species — animals with developed spinal cords — are currently threatened or endangered. But a new article, published today in Science, paints an even more alarming picture, as scientists have found that the number of individual insects, crustaceans, worms, and spiders decreased by 45 percent on average over the past 40 years — a period in which the global human population doubled. dramatic declines in abundance ""We had strong suspicions that the problem was largely with the vertebrates,"" said Rodolfo Dirzo, an ecologist at Stanford University, in an email to The Verge. ""But it was surprising to see this now, also, among the invertebrates,"" or animals without developed spines. Dirzo calls this loss of animal life ""defaunation,"" and he blames it on humans. ""The richness of the animal world of our planet is being seriously threatened by human activities,"" he said. Many species have gone extinct and the ones that remain — mammals, birds, and insects alike — are showing dramatic declines in their abundance. In the article, Dirzo and his colleagues reviewed past studies, and compiled a global index of all invertebrate species over the past 40 years. Overall, they found that 67 percent of the world’s invertebrates have declined in numbers by an average of 45 percent. In the UK, for instance, there has been a 30 to 60 percent decline in the number of butterflies, bees, beetles, and wasps. This, the researchers write, is important because too often we measure animal diversity in terms of number of species, or in terms of extinctions. But an animal’s contribution is about more than the mere presence of its species on the planet — it’s also about local shifts in populations that could impact everything from agriculture to human health. Not just silent springs, but empty forestsDirzo calls this ""a dire situation,"" because continuing on the same trajectory will lead to a ""very impoverished planet."" To illustrate the depth of the problem, Dirzo appears to borrow a page from Rachel Carson, except that instead of using the metaphor of a ""silent spring,"" he thinks of the world’s future in terms of ""empty forests"" — places that might ""look green, lush and seemingly healthy,"" he said, but that contain no animal life whatsoever. Yet ""empty forests"" are really only a symbol of the extent to which this problem needs solving. If animal populations continue to decline, the risks to human health will be significant, because 75 percent of the world’s food crops necessitate insect pollination. Moreover, invertebrates contribute significantly to agricultural pest control — not to mention decomposition, which increases plant productivity. That’s why Dirzo thinks that humans need to take action, by reducing or eliminating our current over-exploitation of animals, and by protecting their natural habitats. These, he said, are the main factors driving defaunation. If we can achieve change, he said, ""We might able to ‘buy time’ to address the other causes of defaunation that will begin to impact life soon — particularly climate disruption.""",0.4971399145527795,0.5028600854472205,0.8680111104795133,556,5.2158273381294968,315,6.3396825396825394,0,0,Science,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

By looking at genetic variants in over 180,000 women of European descent, an international group of researchers was able to pinpoint which regions of our DNA contribute to the timing of puberty. This, they say, is crucial to our understanding of health problems like Type 2 diabetes and breast cancer, because the timing of a woman’s first period has been linked to both. ""We identified over 100 regions of the genome that were associated with puberty timing,"" said John Perry, lead author of the study published in Nature today and a geneticist at the University of Cambridge, in an email to The Verge. ""However our analyses suggest there are likely to be thousands of variants and possibly genes involved in a broad range of biological pathways and processes."" These results, Perry said, means that the factors that influence the timing of a woman's first period are much more complex than scientists and doctors originally thought. one parent might have a stronger influence on their daughter's puberty Another noteworthy finding comes by way of our imprinted genes — genes in which the copy from one parent is silenced in favor of the copy that came from the other parent (meaning that they don't produce a hybrid effect). The researchers found that these genes play an important role in puberty among women, which means that within a family, one parent might actually have a much stronger influence on their daughter's puberty than to the other. ""Until now, imprinted genes were largely thought to be only important for growth and development in babies before birth,"" Perry said, ""however our study supports the idea that these genes continue to play a role in later life health and disease."" But the study doesn't offer all the answers. For one thing, Perry said the number of women they included in the study limits their ability to determine exactly which genes are involved, and how. ""Our results indicate that it’s likely millions of women would need to be included to successfully identify a significant fraction of all puberty genes that are likely to exist,"" he explained. ""However, we hope the genes we have identified so far should provide significant insights into reproductive biology with the aid of further studies."" Another possible issue is that only data from women with European backgrounds were used in the study. Women of different ancestral backgrounds might display some variation in individual genetic variants, Perry said. But the researchers are planning to study women of different backgrounds as well, and Perry thinks the underlying genes and biological processes will remain the same across populations. 50 percent nature, 50 percent nurture Finally, it’s important to note that when it comes to puberty, genes aren’t everything. The timing of a women’s first period is actually 50 percent nature and 50 percent nurture. This means that environmental factors — things like nutrition, family stressors, and physical activity — also have a strong influence on the timing of a woman’s first period. Still, given that women who experience puberty at younger ages have a higher risk of developing Type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and breast cancer, these findings are important. If scientists can figure out why one woman started buying tampons when she turned nine, whereas another only had to buy them at 14, we might gain a better understanding of the underlying biology behind various life-threatening diseases — as well as the approaches that could stop them from occurring in the first place.",0.49887101042565746,0.5011289895743425,0.8103638963315462,612,5.1372549019607847,313,6.1884984025559104,0,0,Science,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Despite a slight increase in vaccination rates over previous years, only 35 percent of adolescent boys and 57 percent of adolescent girls received one or more doses of the HPV vaccine by their 13th birthday in 2013. This, the agency says, can mainly be attributed to ""knowledge gaps among parents"" and a failure on the part of clinicians to recommend the vaccine. The HPV vaccine consists of three doses of a drug that adolescents receive between the age of 11 and 13. It protects against human papillomavirus, a common STD that can lead to various forms of cancer, such as cervical cancer, anal cancer, penile cancer, and throat cancer. But despite its effectiveness — the HPV vaccine has been associated with a significant decline in infections that can cause cancer among teens — parents and clinicians have been slow to adopt it, even when they’re open to other forms of vaccines. For instance, although 86 percent of 13- to 17-year-olds in the US receive a dose of the whooping cough vaccine, only about a third of adolescent girls receive all three doses of the HPV vaccine, according to the report. This is a big problem, the CDC says, because if the adolescent girls who are given other vaccines were also vaccinated against HPV before their thirteenth birthdays, 91 percent of them would have some protection from various forms of cancer. ""Today, I wish I had good news."" ""Today, I wish I had good news, but what I need to report is a small increase... in HPV vaccination,"" said Anne Schuchat, director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Disease, during a press conference. Schuchat explained that HPV vaccination coverage for girls only increased by 3.5 percentage points in the last year. ""Our system is clearly missing many opportunities"" to hand out the HPV vaccine, she said. Still, ""it is a relief that we did not continue to have flatlining in HPV vaccines,"" she said, given that there was ""absolutely no improvement between 2011 and 2012."" Part of the problem, the CDC says, is that despite a significant increase in clinician recommendations in the last year, doctors still fail to recommend the vaccine universally. According to parent reports, doctors recommended the vaccine to 64 percent of girls and 42 percent of boys in 2013, compared with 2012’s 61 percent and 28 percent, respectively. Parental worry over the vaccine’s safety was also cited in the report as a reason to forgo vaccination. This, despite the fact that there have been no serious safety concerns linked to the vaccine in the last eight years — a period during which 67 million doses were distributed, the CDC says. Previous news reports have also pointed to parental dismay that doctors are recommending a drug to preteens and teens that has ties to sexual activity. This, some have said, might lead to increases in teen sex rates. That, too, has been disproved. Nevertheless, Schuchat said that the CDC doesn’t ""think this is an issue of politics. We think parents are open to recommendations,"" but they simply don’t have the knowledge about the vaccines or aren’t getting the proper recommendations from their doctors. ""Doctors have some room for improvement in how they talk about the vaccine."" Given these findings, the CDC says that addressing gaps in clinician knowledge and communication skills is crucial. ""Doctors have some room for improvement in how they talk about the vaccine,"" Schuchat said. Improving public acceptance of the vaccine is also important, the researchers write, which is why the CDC ""continues to use research data to create an evidence-based communication campaign to reach the target audiences.""  Still, progress has been slow, so the CDC plans to step up its collaborations with doctors, cancer organizations, and local immunization programs to ensure that they continue to promote the HPV vaccine. Schuchat also recommends that parents ask about vaccinations every time their children see a doctor, and that, from the moment they’re born. ""The results were are reporting today are disappointing,"" Schuchat said. ""Every twenty minutes, an American is diagnosed with an HPV-associated cancer... these results remind us that there is a lot more to do.""",0.40412838043367744,0.5958716195663225,0.8484972282251991,730,5.0849315068493155,368,6.2119565217391308,0,0,Science,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

We've seen the same look over and over, across dozens of movies, books and museums: there's the balanced tail, the lizard-shaped head and, most of all, dark and tough scales. The way we think of dinosaurs may have to change But a new find in Siberia has paleontologists suspecting that look may be flat wrong. A team of researchers led by Pascal Godefroit has found a new dinosaur with ultra-thin feathers, joining other feathered species found in China and North America. More importantly, the new find is the first non-carnivorous dinosaur with feathers, which many in the field have taken as evidence that feathers were far more widespread than previously thought. If they're right, a big part of the way we think of dinosaurs may have to change. Godefriot's new creature is called the Kulindadromeus zabaikalicus — a Jurassic creature about a meter and a half long, with large legs, short arms, and a very long tail. Because of the unusually well-preserved fossil, Godefroit could tell the Kulindadromeus had feathering on its torso and neck, but not its face, legs, or tail. ""Potentially, all dinosaurs could be covered with feathers."" Though feathered dinosaurs have been found before — Chinese groups found feathers on dinosaurs back in the 1990s — they have all been theropods, a class of upright dinosaurs like the Tyrannosaurus rex, which let researchers explain the feathers as part of the creatures’ eventual evolution into birds. But the plant-eating Kulindadromeus doesn't fit into that story. All the proto-bird species have been carnivores, so these feathers must have grown up independently of that evolutionary branch. That suggests that some dinosaurs,  including many of the better-known species, may have developed feathers independently. ""Probably more of them had feathers but those feathers were not fossilized,"" Godefriot told The Verge. ""Potentially, all dinosaurs could be covered with feathers.""  An alternate illustration of the Kulindadromeus zabaikalicus. ""There are many, many questions left."" The theory has already found support among others in the community. Darla Zelenitsky, who unearthed the first feathered dinosaur in North America in 2012, says the growing number of finds are pushing the paleontology community towards a tipping point. ""The popular scaly model of plant-eating dinosaurs may, in years to come, be completely replaced by a feathered-scaly model,"" Zelenitsky says. Since the Kulindadromeus is flightless, some have speculated that the creature evolved feathers for warmth, which would bring in a lot of other dinosaurs potential candidates. The big issue is the absence of evidence. Feathers aren't in our fossil record for most dinosaur species, but it's hard to say if that's because the feathers were never there or because they decomposed along the way. Paleontologists had been assuming the creatures were featherless for evolutionary reasons — but if theropods and the new Kulindadromeus developed feathers independently, hundreds of other species could potentially have taken the same route. ""It's really just the starting point,"" Godefriot says, ""there are many many questions left.""",0.5800975107135454,0.41990248928645457,0.18526975564074943,511,5.3874755381604693,283,6.2862190812720851,0,0,"Science, Report",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The partnership says that the results represent teens' increasing interest in performance-enhancing substances like steroids, which synthetic human growth hormone (HGH) is often used as a substitute for.  ""It is difficult if not impossible to know what exactly is contained in these products."" HGH naturally occurs in the body, but a synthetic version of it is available as a prescription for treating diseases, deficiencies, and issues with short stature. Because the study relies on self-reported data, it's unlikely that teens are all actually using prescription HGH — instead, many may well be using supplements that are marketed as containing HGH or promoting HGH production in the body. Even so, teens' intended use of HGH without a prescription still signals an increased interest in using it improve their appearance and athletic performance — that may well recognize it as one of the drugs that Lance Armstrong took. While the study found that the difference in use between boys and girls was what it considers to be slight (12 percent to 9 percent), it did find that African-American teens (15 percent) and Hispanic teens (13 percent) were more likely than Caucasian teens (9 percent) to report that they had used synthetic HGH at least once. The Partnership for Drug-Free Kids is of course concerned with the marked increase in reported use, especially with regard to how it might relate to a broader misuse of prescription drugs and their consumption of supplements. ""It is difficult if not impossible to know what exactly is contained in these products teens are consuming,"" Steve Pasierb, CEO of the Partnership for Drug-Free Kids, says in a statement. In addition to better education about the use of performance-enhancing drugs, Pasierb suggests that lawmakers examine how supplements are being marketed, saying that it calls for the ""serious evaluation of the areas in which current controls on manufacturing and marketing are failing to prevent the use of these products by teens.""",0.6374630047361995,0.36253699526380045,0.15521361467611194,389,5.1799485861182522,215,6.1581395348837207,0,0,Science,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The effect was particularly pronounced in the female germ line, indicating Methoxychlor is particularly harmful for the descendants of female subjects. But beyond a single pesticide, the results suggest that ancestral exposures may be a more powerful factor in a person's health than the medical community had previously realized. ""The idea that your ancestors' exposures influence your disease has not been seriously considered in our ideas of how disease develops,"" says Michael Skinner, a WSU professor who led the research team. ""Now we need to start considering that as a factor.""",0.36658748529825735,0.6334125147017426,0.8040415256852707,231,5.3896103896103895,155,6.0774193548387094,0,0,Science,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Luca Maestri, Apple's vice president of finance and corporate controller, will become his successor. The role will begin to transition to Maestri in June. ""Luca has over 25 years of global experience in senior financial management, including roles as a public company CFO, and I am confident he will be a great CFO at Apple,"" Apple CEO Tim Cook says in a statement. Maestri came to Apple about a year ago from Xerox, where he served as CFO. Apple appears to have known about Oppenheimer's retirement plans for some time now, and it says that Maestri was always intended as his replacement. ""When we were recruiting for a corporate controller, we met Luca and knew he would become Peter’s successor,"" Cook says. Maestri previously spent two decades with GM, holds a bachelors in economics from Luiss University in Rome, and a masters in Science of Management from Boston University. Though he's only been at Apple for a year, Maestri already appears to have had a large impact on its finances. In particular, Maestri is believed to be one of the driving forces behind Apple's recent and uncharacteristically large stock buybacks. The company's buyback program has become increasingly aggressive since Maestri came on board, and investors estimate that Apple will repurchase over $30 billion in stock this year. 10 years as CFO While Apple stresses that it's prepared for the transition, it'll be a big change to its executive team: Oppenheimer joined Apple in 1996 and became its CFO eight years later. During the decade that followed, Apple experienced the largest growth and success in its history, fueled first by the iPod, then the iPhone and iPad. His departure is one of only a few to Apple's executive team since the death of Steve Jobs in 2011. That list includes retail chief Ron Johnson who left to briefly run JCPenney, and iOS software chief Scott Forstall, who was removed from the company during a reorganization in late 2012. As Cook notes, Oppenheimer has overseen much of Apple's major growth. ""Peter has served as our CFO for the past decade as Apple’s annual revenue grew from $8 billion to $171 billion and our global footprint expanded dramatically,"" he says. Cook emphasized that Oppenheimer has put together a ""professional succession plan"" to ensure that the transition won't cause problems for Apple. Certainly, with several months to begin the transition, Oppenheimer should have plenty of time to ease Maestri into the new role. Oppenheimer was recently added to Goldman Sachs' board of directors, though his stated plans for retirement are all personal. Oppenheimer says that he wants to travel, spend more time with his family, and get a pilot's license.

We haven't seen much of what Internet.org intends to do, but the purchase of Titan Aerospace would certainly put a bold foot forward.

The rise of Keurig has even prompted brands like Starbucks, Folgers, and Dunkin' Donuts to release their own K-Cups, which users insert into the Keurig each time they want a cup of coffee. But other, unlicensed companies have also been able to hop on the bandwagon thanks to crucial patents that expired in 2012. That gave competitors the opportunity to produce generic K-Cups and price them lower than Green Mountain's official line. And consumers have noticed: generic Keurig pods have seen a steady rise in popularity. But Green Mountain wants to put a stop to that momentum. Much like your inkjet printer, refills are the real money-maker of the Keurig platform. So to ensure consumers stick with its own K-Cups moving forward, Green Mountain is implementing the physical equivalent of a DRM system with Keurig 2.0 — which will start appearing on store shelves this year. Aside from offering a larger 28-ounce serving size, Keurig's next line of brewers will contain ""interactive technology"" designed to lock out unlicensed K-Cups. On a recent earnings call, CEO Brian Kelley insisted the change is primarily meant to ""ensure the system delivers on the promise of excellent quality beverages produced simply and consistently every time."" Buying coffee will soon be just as annoying as buying printer ink It will also protect Green Mountain's multibillion-dollar K-Cup business — assuming consumers see a need to upgrade their existing brewers. If not, unlicensed K-Cup pods will likely continue eating into Green Mountain's bottom line. Kelley seems confident Keurig owners will make the transition.

Symantec researchers published their findings today on a new Trojan they're calling ""Regin."" The researchers say the tool is ""a complex piece of malware whose structure displays a degree of technical competence rarely seen."" It's been cleverly designed to spy on computer systems around the world while leaving hardly a trace behind. The software's ""authors have gone to great lengths to cover its tracks,"" reports Symantec, by using multiple layers of complex encryption to mask spying activities. Even when Symantec's researchers did discover the presence of malware on clients' machines, they had to decrypt an entire sample package of files just to get some idea of what the tool was up to. The espionage tool has been found primarily on systems in Russia and Saudi Arabia, though its presence has been detected in smaller numbers in Mexico, Ireland, India, Afghanistan, Iran, Belgium, Austria, and Pakistan. Over half of all confirmed cases were on machines in Russia and Saudi Arabia. ""Its authors have gone to great lengths to cover its tracks."" Attacks on internet providers and telecom companies — with the goal of obtaining information from the small businesses and individuals that use their services — accounted for roughly 75 percent of infections. Airlines, energy utilities, research agencies, and hospitality companies were also targets of such attacks. As you might expect, something this complex isn't designed to steal your credit card numbers. The sophistication of the software and its confirmed targets, according to Symantec, makes almost certain that the malware is state-sponsored. In fact, the researchers say that it is similar to the Stuxnet worm that was allegedly designed to sabotage Iran's nuclear program. They should know: this group of computer security experts are the same team that first discovered Stuxnet. The US, Israel, and China are believed to be among the nations with the funding and expertise to develop and execute such attacks. ""A huge spying campaign dating back at least to 2008."" Whichever nation-state sponsored this malware, it's believed that Regin is likely that government's primary means of executing cyber espionage around the world. One of the malware's fairly unique traits is that it is highly customizable. Different packages can be built into the payload that infects computer systems. Some of the typical tools the software has at its disposal is the ability to remotely control the mouse and keyboard, take screenshots, record key presses and network activity, and recover deleted files. But spies could also load more specialized functionality designed for specific monitoring of energy utility or telecom systems, according to researchers. Those custom payloads ""exhibit a high degree of expertise in specialist sectors,"" according to researchers — another sign that a large state player is behind the software. What's not clear is how the malware executes an attack. In just one single confirmed case, it exploited an undiscovered Yahoo Messenger vulnerability, but the researchers speculate that it can use spoofed versions of popular websites or other application holes to gain access to computer systems. The pattern of attacks does show, however, that the software has been used for years. ""This has been a huge spying campaign dating back at least to 2008 and maybe even as early as 2006,"" researcher Liam O’Murchu tells Recode. Attacks abruptly halted in 2011, before an updated version of the malware was introduced to the web in 2013. There's still much that's unknown, but now that Regin's existence has been publicized, we should expect more details to trickle out over the coming months.",0.671496227407321,0.32850377259267904,0.6038273988172773,621,5.3140096618357484,373,6.2654155495978552,0,0,US & World,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

Last week an ambitious public Wi-Fi project called LinkNYC was unveiled: an effort that will erect up to 10,000 pillars offering free wireless internet and domestic phone calls to New York City's residents and visitors. It's a bold public-private partnership that has been sold to the people as a program that ""will be built at no cost to taxpayers."" CityBridge, the company behind the project, says it will even ""generate more than $500 million in revenue for the city over the first 12 years."" That all sounds great — except it's not the municipal Wi-Fi dream we were promised. There was reason to be skeptical of the plan when it was announced last week. Each LinkNYC pillar will throw ""gigabit"" internet in a radius of up to 150 feet. That's Google Fiber fast, but it all depends on how well the signal can penetrate buildings and other objects around it. And, more importantly, there's also the fact that no wireless devices capable of handling anything close to gigabit speeds exist right now. But those aren't even the biggest problems with the plan.   Today the NY Daily News revealed that many of the Wi-Fi kiosks throughout the city will provide speeds 10 times slower than the advertised gigabit speeds. While Manhattan will be densely covered by the fastest possible speeds, the Daily News reports that other New York residents won't be so lucky; the network will reportedly operate more slowly on average in Staten Island and poorer neighborhoods in Brooklyn and the Bronx. The mayor's office told the Daily News that the tiered-speed system is only temporary, but it could take a long time for the system to get up to speed; the first kiosks are expected in late 2015 but the project could take many years to complete. And even if every LinkNYC kiosk carried the maximum speeds, the system would fall dramatically short of providing access to all New Yorkers. Each kiosk has limited range, and in many neighborhoods they will be spaced so far apart that residents might as well just go to a coffee shop or library for free internet — it's not going to be pouring into their homes.  LinkNYC is certainly advanced in many respects, and even 100Mbps of download speed is truly better than what most people get from their home ISP or wireless carrier. Those speeds just won't matter much if the people who need it the most, specifically the poorest members of society, won't have convenient access to it. ""For every New Yorker, in every borough"" One of the biggest problems is that LinkNYC will be funded by advertising, and as the Daily News correctly points out, the poorest neighborhoods in the city aren't worth as much to advertisers as tourist-packed Times Square. That's a reality that makes sense for profit-seeking businesses to build around, but not so much for public-facing utilities that ought to provide reasonably equal levels of service to everyone. It's also not what we were sold by Mayor Bill de Blasio, who made this grand statement about the program last week: ""This administration has been committed to expanding affordable access to broadband for all New Yorkers from the outset. It's essential for everything we need to do to be a fair and just city, because we can't continue to have a digital divide that holds back so many of our citizens. With this proposal for the fastest and largest municipal Wi-Fi network in the world — accessible to and free for all New Yorkers and visitors alike — we're taking a critical step toward a more equal, open and connected city — for every New Yorker, in every borough."" As Susan Crawford argues, US mayors have a great opportunity to bring municipal broadband service to millions of Americans who have been abused or neglected by monopolistic internet service providers. Hopefully New York City residents won't be shafted by another public-private partnership that makes the digital divide deeper while merely claiming to bridge it.",0.5306147765358397,0.46938522346416034,0.4553109793673505,679,4.8615611192930777,358,5.9022346368715084,1,2,US & World,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

Never mind the fact that you are, at any given moment along its 1.5-mile stretch, surrounded by 21-ton rings of iron and submerged close to 100 feet below the Hudson River: not being able to post a tweet or text a friend in one spot is enough to forget that it was possible just a few feet ago. So what exactly makes it possible? Last week, AT&T and the Port Authority of New York & New Jersey brought me down into the center tube of the Lincoln Tunnel with a group of local journalists to answer that question in detail. Simply put, you can tweet from the tunnel thanks to a forward-thinking technological plan that was put in place 20 years ago. Back then, the Port Authority of New York & New Jersey wanted to help extend the cellular service that AT&T had built out along the nation’s highways. Through a lengthy series of overnight tunnel closures, the two sides worked to install a service called ""leaky coax,"" which was used at the time around the country by police and fire departments to relay communications in places where antenna-boosted signals would have trouble with fidelity. It consists of cables that run the full 8,000 feet of each of the three tunnels. The idea gets its name from the fact that the cables have holes in them that literally ""leak"" the cellular signal into the tunnel. It's not perfect, though. ""It’s not very efficient. We use very low-power systems, so the loss over the cables was a real challenge,"" AT&T's Director of Radio Technology Carl Busseno said as we walked around the inside of the tunnel. ""So what we had to do is we had to actually break the system up into four quadrants within the tunnel itself."" To do this, AT&T installed base stations in both the New Jersey- and New York-side ventilation buildings, which were built above the tunnel to act as exhausts while pumping fresh air in. These stations combine with antennae outside both ends to split the 8,000 feet into 2,000-foot sections — a length that makes the signal loss much more manageable. Why not just use regular antennae throughout the tunnel? The immediate reason was space — AT&T was told that if they installed antennae along the walls of each of the three tunnels, they would likely be knocked off by the machines the Port Authority uses to clean the tunnel's walls. The long-term reason, though, was it would have forced a massive upkeep effort. ""If we had put separate antennae in, we would have had to keep upgrading. But the leaky coax allows you to use any technology over it,"" said  Carl Busseno.   ""Now as we upgrade the network it’s all done in the base station. The leaky coax stays the same."" In other words, the 20-year-old plan idea has easily scaled over the years, and the same infrastructure that once supported the earliest cell phones can now support 3G, 4G, and soon enough, LTE signals. While this technology has quietly benefitted travelers and tri-state residents for two decades, it also has near-future implications — it’s likely going to be one of the ways that cellular service makes it into New York City’s subway system. According to Busseno, the plan is to use antennae along the straighter sections of the subway, essentially blasting the signals from platform to platform until they overlap enough to cover the whole tunnel. But that solution is too unidirectional to cover the ones that curve; that's where leaky coax comes into play. There are lots of things in New York City that leak; most are bad. This is the rare exception. The leaky coax runs 8,000 linear feet along the length of each of the Lincoln Tunnel's tubes. The top cable is where the leaky coax technology lives, fastened every few feet along the 8,000-foot tube. Port Authority CTO Robert Galvin holds up a Motorola MicroTac 650, one of the popular cell phones at the time the technology was installed. The same infrastructure that allowed this phone to make and receive calls in the tunnel works with today's technolo The New Jersey Lincoln Tunnel vent building is where AT&T and the other companies' base stations are housed, which send (and repeat) the signal through the tunnel. Since AT&T helped build out the technology in the first place, the company has its own room in which it houses all of the base station equipment. AT&T's Director of Radio Technology Carl Busseno explains how the company gets the signal to and from the base station room. Inside the base station room is one twenty-year-old logbook, where all of the activity from the past two decades has been recorded. The logbook contains entries for things like Ericsson employees visiting, tables being delivered, and details about upgrades to the overall system. Other cell companies have had to find space in the top floor of the ventilation building for their base stations. The cell companies' base stations are located in Lincoln Tunnel vent buildings on both sides of the river, which are home to dozens of chalk-drawn diagrams and charts that the Port Authority workers use as reference. Busseno points out the the section of the room where all the upgrades to the entire system have been made.

According to a newly published page, ""you can request a refund for nearly any purchase on Steam — for any reason."" As long as a player has purchased the game within the past 14 days and played less than two hours, they can file a request through Steam's support system. Valve will return the money within a week through the player's payment method or, failing that, Steam Wallet. Valve has laid out some special circumstances where its blanket policy doesn't apply. Downloadable content and in-game purchases, for example, may or may not be covered, depending on whether it's been ""consumed,"" whether the underlying game has been played two hours or more, and whether the developers have their own refund policy. Movies aren't a particularly big part of Steam's catalog, but there are a few gaming documentaries and VR experiences on there, and they generally aren't refundable. You can't get refunds for Steam items you buy from third parties (presumably including sales like the Humble Bundle.) Competing services like Origin and GOG already offer refund policies Valve says it will still look at requests that fall outside the refund policy, but there are obviously no guarantees. It's also not clear if it will make any concessions to games that are playable in under two hours — to name one popular example, it's entirely possible to go through indie game Gone Home in that time. (Practiced speedrunners could theoretically do the same to larger titles, but that's a bit of an edge case.) Valve reserves the general right to avoid abuse of the system, although it notes that ""we do not consider it abuse to request a refund on a title that was purchased just before a sale and then immediately [re-buy] that title for the sale price."" Until now, Steam games were effectively non-refundable in the US. Valve carved out exceptions for local consumer protection laws in the European Union and New Zealand, but even these were somewhat confusing. Now, it's closer to competing digital platforms like Origin and GOG. Electronic Arts-owned Origin offers what it calls a ""great game guarantee"" for any EA game and some third-party games. Buyers can request a refund for any reason within seven days of buying a game or 24 hours of launching it for the first time; if they're returning it because of technical problems, that can be extended. GOG, which lets users download games without copy protection, is in a somewhat more vulnerable position. It offers a 30-day ""withdrawal right"" for any purchase, as long as it hasn't been downloaded or launched at all. Beyond that, though, it will only refund a game if there's a major, game-breaking bug.

Deus Ex somehow managed to feel both perfectly self-contained and open — each level was a living environment and a carefully designed map that could be traversed in any number of (usually stealthy) ways. It’s since seen a sequel and multiple prequels, but the original game owes a lot to its crudeness. The more realistic it got, the more scripted it felt, like some kind of ludic uncanny valley effect. I mention this because Neon Struct, a paranoia-inducing little stealth game, is the stripped-down Deus Ex I didn’t know I was waiting for. Instead of trying to fix the limitations of late-’90s sneaking games, it embraces them, paring away everything except the genre’s most basic tropes.   Neon Struct places you in the shoes of a spy named Jillian Cleary, who works for the kind of covert agency that puts a giant glowing eye in the lobby of its headquarters. She sneaks into compounds where guards walk in perfectly straight, never-changing paths, always carry keycards in their back pockets, and can be knocked into deep, peaceful sleep with a blow to the back of the head. After Jillian inevitably discovers a global surveillance program, there’s one of those ubiquitous prison levels where all her equipment gets confiscated and she has to find the random crate that holds it before escaping. If she’s nice to pedestrians, one of them will invariably point her to the local black-market spy gear dealer. There’s even a dramatic synth score that sounds an awful lot like Deus Ex’s. It’s all potently nostalgic (and a little predictable), but it’s also creating a distinct language and aesthetic. The low-poly graphics, simple enemy behavior, and boxy levels turn the game into a series of stylized, satisfying puzzles. There’s no map, so you’ll rely solely on your own sense of direction, keeping track of the secret entrances and enemy patterns. There’s a hacking minigame, a mainstay of the genre, but it’s literally a quick round of Breakout. There are only a few items and options, including temporary invisibility or footstep-silencing ""stims,"" so you’ll spend most of your time exploiting light switches, hidden ladders, and security system hacks. Neon Struct isn't usually hard, but it favors perfectionism Neon Struct isn’t usually hard, but it favors perfectionism by grading your performance — whether you set off alarms, whether you had to incapacitate any foes — after each section. There are little Easter eggs scattered throughout the game, but it’s not about exploration as much as mastery — once you’ve figured a level out, you want to jump back in and do everything better. There are only so many ways to navigate its simple environments, but that simplicity makes them feel more like walkable architectural models than a series of predetermined paths. Even the fiction is built on this mechanical straightforwardness. The low-poly design turns every character into a faceless cipher; in a game about trust and anonymity, this means that almost all the people around you are effectively wearing the same mask, whether they’re a random guard or one of the mysterious black-clad strangers that appear in dark corners. Between missions, it winkingly offers another gaming cliche: the mundane good deeds that your highly trained secret agent protagonist will helpfully perform for random passersby. Characters in Neon Struct will ask you to buy them food. They will ask you to find the hotel keycard they lost in plain sight. They will sit 10 feet away from another character and ask you to set them up on a date.   The missions are so ridiculously trivial that you start performing them almost by reflex, until a chance interaction reminds you that you’re a wanted criminal wandering around talking to everyone you see. It’s not just self-aware commentary, it’s a metaphor for the million innocuous interactions that can be harvested for personal information in the real world. As the game progresses, you start wondering whether throwaway choices, like walking into a bar or pilfering a hard drive, will have long-term repercussions. I don’t think they do, but there’s still a nagging sense of uncertainty. What does a conspiracy game look like when the conspiracies are real? The game pulls its politics straight from real-life whistleblowers like Edward Snowden. You can pick Jillian’s path to a point, but there’s a clear division between good and evil, transparency and surveillance, fictionalized WikiLeaks and fictionalized Stratfor. The X-Files-inspired Deus Ex is a morally ambiguous ‘90s-conservative fantasy where even the most improbable fears are justified, from a UN takeover to Area 51 aliens. Humans can only really free themselves by rejecting modern technology altogether. Neon Struct’s fairly optimistic story is much more comforting to technophiles, but it’s also just what stories look like when the real-world conspiracies do turn out to be true. We don’t have to wonder whether an intelligence agency is tracking our phone calls, or whether the CIA hacked into Senate staffers’ computers while they conducted a torture investigation. Knowing about something isn’t the same as understanding or changing it, but in some ways, it makes for a simpler narrative. Neon Struct isn’t about reworking a futuristic society, it’s about reform, about living under the system we have now. And about ducts. Conveniently woman-sized ducts.",0.5961682832963658,0.40383171670363416,0.17009548728257137,925,5.2216216216216216,527,6.5673624288425048,0,4,"Culture, Entertainment, Gaming, Games Review",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

This is the first line, spoken by Johnny ""Drama"" Chase (Kevin Dillon), in the motion picture Entourage. The film is a continuation of the television show of the same name, which ran for eight more or less culturally uncontested seasons on HBO. It's been over three years since Vince and the boys rode their twin private jets into the sunset, and almost five since series creator Doug Ellin initially floated the idea of a movie. In the interim, a lot has changed: TV has become fertile ground for stories about complex female characters, everyone got really into a show about dragons, and Broad City exists. The world and moment that Entourage encapsulated seems woefully outdated. Except not, because Entourage exists outside the reaches of time, space, and logic, and if you told me it never actually ended and I've actually been mumbling ""Oh yay-yuh! Oh yay-yuh!"" along with the Jane's Addiction theme song for the past three years, I might believe you.   Before we go any further, I must admit a bias — not that I'm an Entourage superfan; I was never a terribly faithful viewer of the show, and I definitely have not seen every episode, especially in the later, increasingly rote seasons. But I have spent the last 48-plus hours locked in an entirely voluntary marathon of the first two seasons, and they have pervaded my headspace to such a degree that I felt almost personally affronted when the entire theater at the press screening I attended did not burst out in riotous applause at the first aerial shot of the boys cruising in a motorboat off the coast of Ibiza. After the past several days stewing in the bro-verse, this felt like a towering cinematic moment on the order of the Star Wars title zooming back into the stars to John Williams fanfare. Like I said, I came in with a bias. Everything will work out fine To submit yourself to the world of Entourage is to surrender any expectation of so much of what we associate with satisfying television: tension, stakes, darkness. The first two seasons feel like a hallucination: we are presented with this entitled, variously simpleminded group of men, the leader of which lives by the shockingly durable philosophy that ""everything will work out fine."" We are trained, by centuries of storytelling tradition, to take that as an omen. Oh, that's what someone says right before he walks into a manhole, we think. Part of Entourage's crazy-making charm is that the manhole never materializes. Sure, there are hitches and bumps along the way — fudged deals, a cocaine addiction — but Vincent Chase never gets a lasting comeuppance for all his boorish ways. And that's what makes 10 episodes — and yes, a feature-length film — melt by in what seems like a half-hour, give or take. I never checked my clock during the entirety of the Entourage movie — I thought about it, but then preferred to marvel at the fact that I could not tell if 20 minutes or two hours had gone by. From a formally critical standpoint, I think that might be a good thing. The plot of Entourage concerns what so many plots of Entourage have concerned: the making of a film. We catch up with the dudes mere weeks after the events of the finale; Vince's marriage to a hot Vanity Fair writer lasted all of five days, and he's back on the market, hosting a yacht party full of the requisite topless babes. He also has decided that he wants to direct a film, and because he is Vincent Chase, he will indeed direct a film. Entourage, god bless it, has always been incredibly smart about what it chooses to yadda-yadda. We immediately flash forward eight months — Vince's directorial debut Hyde is in the can, and is being shepherded by superagent-turned-studio head Ari Gold (Jeremy Piven; what, you didn't really think Ari was out of the game, did you?). His former driver Sal ""Turtle"" Assante (Jerry Ferrara) is now a multimillionaire with a successful tequila business, and his manager / best dude Eric ""E"" Murphy (Kevin Connolly) is expecting the birth of his son with OTP babymama Sloane any day. I have to say, you don't miss those eight months. Entourage has never been about the joys and struggles of making the films that its characters rely on for cash flow. It's always been about the joys and sorrows — okay, mostly joys ­— of the cash flow. Entourage has always been smart about what it chooses to yadda-yadda I now realize I need to back up for a second and talk about Hyde. Oh lordy, Hyde.  We see what amounts to a trailer-length montage of Vince's passion project, and goddammit, I wish that the movie had just cut out and the ushers had escorted us to the theatre next door to watch the whole thing. Hyde, as it may surprise some LA lifers to know, is not a filmic adaptation of the notorious celeb hangout that enjoyed its heyday about the same time Entourage enjoyed its. Hyde takes place in a dystopic future Los Angeles, where Vince plays some kind of underworld DJ who feeds people floating golden molly-pellets while they rave under a bridge. (Wait ... maybe it is an adaptation?) Vince wears a hoodie and broods a lot. It's basically the music video for Britney Spears' Til The World Ends, except we are told its running time is two hours. Everyone, from Ari to Dana Gordon (Constance Zimmer's lovely, witty saving grace of Entourage's willful woman problem) agree that Hyde is a masterpiece. This we accept. Everyone, that is, except Travis McCreadle (Haley Joel Osment), son of oil tycoon Larsen McCreadle (Billy Bob Thornton), whose approval and checkbook stand in the way of Hyde getting locked. Yes, Haley Joel Osment and Billy Bob Thornton are in the Entourage movie. This we accept. They are not playing themselves, like so many of the film's never-ending cascade of gag cameos (there are too many to list here, just watch the trailer), they are playing Texas oil tycoons. This we accept. The reason behind Haley Joel Osment's hesitance — really, the only significant obstacle to the boys' happiness, which is incredible, when you think about it — is so stupid and inconsequential that you probably wouldn't believe me if I spoiled it. Needless to say, everything works out in the end for all the boys, even for the perpetually beleaguered Johnny Drama, who, in addition to setting the tone in the aforementioned opening moments of the film, is the star of its last, completely unearned, but nonetheless satisfying moment of triumph. The film ends with nary a beat of real doubt or uncertainty as to the fate of our heroes. The experience of watching it is like being nudged out of a coma for an hour and a half, then gently coaxed back into it. like being nudged out of a coma, then gently coaxed back into it You might be waiting for the angry feminist lambasting of this film and the show that preceded it, the caveman-like approach to gender and sexuality that have been baked into its brand since the pilot. I'm sorry to disappoint, but you won't find it here. There is a certain class of clueless bro-dom so insistent that it renders itself benign; it comes with its own argument for its ridiculousness. I am aware that there are many fans of Entourage who unironically delight in its hedonistic spoils of patriarchy, but one of the only real tensions of the show all these years has been trying to decipher its degree of self-awareness. In many ways it is a farce, but to characterize it purely as a send-up of the misogyny of Hollywood would probably be giving Ellin and executive producer Mark Wahlberg too much credit. Entourage  likes the world it has created for itself, but it is by no means trying to spread a gospel of tits and 'raris and multimillion dollar contracts, in the way that, say, True Detective really needs you to believe that ""we get the world we deserve."" Entourage is happy to splash around in its own fetid Cristal-filled kiddy pool and leave it at that. Of course, nothing can truly exist in a bubble, and while Entourage is itself an inert object, the culture it's a reflection of is not. But I choose to accept this with nihilistic optimism: there's a shortage of odes to male dominance that are genuinely unthreatening enough for non-male viewers to laugh off, in the way so many viewers feel comfortable writing off 21 Dresses or The Other Woman. We're always asked to take silly, fun boy stories seriously on some level, whether as important, ""smart-dumb"" personality-driven comedy (i.e. any Apatow-verse film) or just really well-constructed entertainment products (i.e. the Fast and Furious movies, which if you think are stupid, means you are objectively no fun). There are so many ""women be crazy"" films out there, and not nearly enough ""white dudes' entitlement be hella pervasive and damaging"" films. Entourage oddly fills an important, mostly vacant spot in contemporary storytelling with its own vacancy. If you should ever need to have a good laugh at the expense of the patriarchy, it's waiting for you.",0.6345348221057212,0.3654651778942788,0.16376174512570127,1575,4.7199999999999998,808,6.1225247524752477,0,4,"Culture, Entertainment, Film, Movie Review",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

The Electronic Entertainment Expo, held every June in Los Angeles, is no longer the biggest video game convention on the planet, but it's the most important. I should say importance, in this case, is a measurement of money and sweat. At E3, the biggest video game publishers announce and promote their newest games, often produced with more developers at a greater expense than their predecessors. The gathering is a chance at national exposure for games that, despite million dollar budgets, struggle to appear in national newspapers or mainstream magazines. Whether or not E3 is culturally relevant is less clear. Pop culture-wise, the latest Call of Duty and Assassin's Creed are presented like annual reports on the industry's latest trends. You like multiplayer now? Or Horde modes? Or asynchronous co-op? They'll have it, just tell them how to please you! But the tip of the creative spear, the games that establish what's new and interesting and daring, they don't have a reputation for appearing at the bombastic event. In the past, those games, made on small budgets by small teams, couldn't afford to show up. This year may be the first E3 in which indie and PC games make a big splash. It'll be nice to see some newcomers mingling with the familiar faces, Farming Simulators in the same room as Mario and Forza. I realize all of this may sound like nonsense to you. That's why I invited Polygon's Griffin McElroy to explain E3. McElroy has attended the show more times than I have, and remains enthusiastic about the spectacle.

The new iPod touch is just as thin (6.1mm) and light (88 grams) as the 2012 version, but it still feels impossibly light. Hollow, even. Inside the new iPod is a lot of the same stuff that makes the iPhone 6 perform so beautifully. Apple's added the 64-bit A8 processor for faster performance, and it shows. Apps load quickly, and it takes less time to switch between them. Web pages quickly snap into view, and videos start up. (All of this happens solely over Wi-Fi, of course.) You can also now track your activity with the touch, because Apple's motion co-processor (the M8 chip) is inside as well. One of the biggest upgrades to the touch is the addition of an 8-megapixel camera in back — a nice bump up from the 5-megapixel shooter found on the 2012 model. It can't shoot video at 240 frames per second, but aside from that, features are similar and the results look good. The cameras on iPads and iPods tend to lag behind the ones found in Apple's phones, so it's nice to see a decent sensor here for once.   The new iPod Touch next to an iPhone 6   Everything else is just as you'd expect. The iPod touch comes with the newest version of iOS (8.4), so it's Apple Music-ready. There's a front-facing camera for FaceTime and selfies, the battery can stretch to 40 hours without video, and there are apps you can't delete, like Stocks and Game Center. The only obvious omission is the silver wrist strap connector that used to occupy the bottom left corner on the back of the iPod Touch. Apple also released new color options for the iPod nano and the iPod shuffle yesterday. Each device is now available in dark blue, hot pink, and gold, in addition to existing silver, black, and red options. Those don't come with any other software or hardware upgrades. The Nano still runs a strange, pared down version of iOS 6, full of bubble icons and harsh gradients, and the shuffle is still the same screen-less clip device. All three new devices are already on the shelves at Apple stores. The new iPod Touch starts at $199 for 16GB of storage, with options all the way up to $399 for a 128GB version.

Apple's marketing machine is still struggling to hit the perfect message that will make the company's smartwatch seem just as essential in your life, and maybe that's why we're getting multiple adverts at a time. The best of these new ones is probably Goals, which focuses on the Apple Watch's fitness features.

By adding two extra-long fingers to the human hand, MIT's ""7 finger robot"" allows a user to perform a much wider range of tasks. Faye Wu, a mechanical engineering graduate student at MIT, said in a video about the project that the fingers take ""the input from a sensor glove... that can measure the position of the human fingers."" Then, an algorithm controls the output of the robotic add-ons using the position of the human fingers, as determined by the sensors. The idea here is to upgrade the human hand so it can perform task like holding very large, hot, or heavy items with ease. This, Wu said, may be especially important ""for [the] elderly and people with disabilities,"" because ""these fingers can help them enjoy living much more independently.""

And these health problems persist independently of the economic status that they experience as adults. But a new study, published today in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, offers some hope. It suggests that giving families as little as 14 hours of training aimed at improving parental nurturing can significantly reduce a child’s long-term inflammation levels — a known risk factor for a variety of health problems, including diabetes, coronary heart disease, and stroke. These findings are significant because they offer a biological basis for the benefits that social workers see following psychosocial interventions. the training discussed risky behaviors, household rules, and racism To reach these conclusions, the researchers recruited 272 African American mothers and children residing in rural Georgia, half of which were living below the poverty line. Then, the researchers provided 173 of the mother-child pairs with 14 hours — or 7 weeks — of parental training when their children turned 11. The training taught parents how to speak to their kids about risky behaviors, household rules, racism, and alcohol use. The remaining mother-child pairs received pamphlets on child development and stress management through the mail instead. Eight years later, the scientists took samples of the teenagers' blood to determine their levels of inflammation. They also recorded other health variables, such as smoking and weight status, as well as the level of parental involvement that they experienced. They found that children whose parents had participated in the training had much lower levels of inflammation than the children of parents who didn't. Moreover, the benefits were ""most pronounced for the families living in the most disadvantaged circumstances,"" the researchers wrote in the study. These sorts of findings are provocative, the researchers say, because they ""reflect a causal process in which [parental nurturing] offsets some of the health risks associated with childhood disadvantage."" Andrea Danese, a psychiatrist and inflammation expert at King’s College London who did not participate in the study, also called the study ""provocative"" in an email to The Verge. He said that researchers already know that short ""interventions targeting parenting practices can have meaningful effects for behavioral outcomes in children,"" but that this paper — which he called scientifically sound — ""shifts the focus to biological outcomes, such as inflammation, which we know affect risk for medical conditions that are more prevalent in children from disadvantaged socio-economic backgrounds."" Thus, the study appears to provide tangible, measurable biological evidence of the beneficial effects of short-term childhood interventions. But William Copeland, en epidemiologist at Duke University, thinks the study could have been better. ""There was no assessment of inflammation markers prior to study involvement, so it is possible that these kids had lower levels to begin with,"" he said in an email exchange.

But they're highly venomous, and are considered an invasive species by the US government because they devour other native fish that maintain coral reefs, leading to reef destruction. Up until recently, it was thought that lionfish could only survive in water with high levels of salt. It took a sixth-grade student's science project to prove otherwise, as the Sun Sentinel reported.  Back in 2012, then 12-year-old Floridian student Lauren Arrington, the daughter of two biologists, decided that for her school science fair project, she would find out the lowest level of salinity that lionfish could thrive in. Her straightforward experiment entailed catching lionfish from the local lagoon, putting them in separate aquariums, then gradually lowering the levels of salinity in some of the tanks. Arrington found that even at very low levels of salinity, the lionfish appeared healthy. Her work, which went on to the regional science fair, attracted the attention of adult researchers at universities in Florida and North Carolina. They went on to perform a larger study that corroborated and expanded upon Arrington's results, showing lionfish could survive in low-salinity estuaries that were previously thought to be inhospitable to them. Arrington's work was also cited in a scientific paper the researchers published earlier this year in the journal Environmental Fish Biology. North Carolina State University scientist Craig Layman went so far as to tell the Sun Sentinel that Arrington's project was ""one of the most influential sixth-grade science projects ever conducted.""

Just take a look at Gollum actor Andy Serkis's incredibly expressive performance as a computer-generated simian in Dawn of the Planet of the Apes. That role, like most other motion capture appearances of late, required sticking hundreds of tiny markers on the human actor's body in order to track his movements and create an accurate digital replica. But what if you could capture motion accurately without those annoying little markers? Scientists at Carnegie Melon University in Pittsburgh have done it with a system reminiscent of the 360-degree cameras used to film the ""bullet time"" sequences in The Matrix. The new technique utilizes enormous spherical dome called the Panoptic Studio, which is outfitted with 480 video cameras pointing inward. The cameras track the movement of any people or objects in the center of the dome — even something as diffuse as confetti floating from the ceiling — in extraordinary detail.   Not all 480 cameras are activated all the time, however. Instead, the system relies on software to highlight a single moving target and figure out where the best viewing angles are for capturing its motion. The software then actives only a few relevant groups of cameras at a time. Though it's still early days for the new system, the early results have been extremely promising. Researchers have been able to get the Panoptic Studio to retrace over 100,000 different points without markers over hundreds of video frames, and with greater accuracy than other motion capture techniques. The number of cameras and the need for an enormous dome may keep their method from coming to your own phone camera anytime soon, but Hollywood is certain to be very interested in the idea.

Cecchi is a computer scientist at IBM, and part of a growing community of scientists who think our voices can reveal far more than our sex, age, or cultural origins. He thinks it can also unlock the mind — and the various psychological and neurological states our brains may be experiencing at any given time. ""This is exactly what psychiatrists do every day: they talk to the patients,"" Cecchi says, ""but we used machine learning and mathematics to replicate it."" In a study published earlier this year, Cecchi used recordings of short interviews to determine which drug his test subjects had been given prior to the experiment. His results rely largely on language and its meaning. ""What we did on the analytics side was to use machine learning techniques that can measure things like semantic distance"" — the symbolic distance between words with related meanings. ""Chair"" and ""table"" are semantically closer than ""chair"" and ""flower"" for instance. ""We can identify individual interviews with high accuracy with regards to the drugs they took just by computing the semantic distance to between a handful of concepts."" people on ecstasy don’t say ""like"" and ""you know"" as often With regards to MDMA, those concepts were friendliness, rapport, and empathy. ""There was a higher similarity to these words in the interviews with a high dose of ecstasy,"" Cecchi says. He also found that people on MDMA used fewer ""catchphrases"" and jargon. When contemporaries talk to each other, ""the word ‘like’ is typically 10 percent of the words."" But people on ecstasy don’t use terms such as ""like"" and ""you know"" as often. Their speech, he says, is much more fluid. Yet Cecchi’s drug-related work represents only one example of the information that our voices contain. He’s also used voice recordings to measure speech disturbances in manic depressive patients, and people who suffer from schizophrenia. Moreover, in recent years, scientists have begun to investigate the voice’s potential for diagnosing Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, sleepiness, depression, and even ADHD. Jorg Langner is a mathematician and musicologist at a Berlin-based company called AudioProfiling. He think ADHD isn’t just about movement or ability to focus. That’s why his team is working on diagnosing children with ADHD using voice recordings. ""Speech rhythm of an ADHD child"" is different from a child without ADHD, he says. ""The length of syllables are less equal in length."" This is but one example of the measures he makes, and he says that, so far, his team has classified 1,000 previously diagnosed children with ""above 90 percent"" accuracy. The ""speech rhythm of an ADHD child"" is different Langner is also developing technology that will detect when someone is too sleepy to drive. When we’re tired, he says, our ""speech rhythm isn’t so precise, it’s inexact."" It’s also ""not very pronounced."" Jarek Krajewski, a psychologist at the Rhenish University of Applied Sciences Cologne, is working on a similar project — except his team wants to apply sleepiness detection to air traffic controllers. ""Sleepiness can be detected with a classification accuracy of about 75-80 percent on unseen speaker, and 80-85 percent on known speaker"" in a matter of seconds, he wrote in an email to The Verge. But detecting sleepy air traffic controllers is just the start for Krajewski. ""We have developed a depression-detection system based on 200 subjects,"" he said. ""Another phonetic approach deals with measuring alcoholization, anxiety, confidence, leadership states or personality."" He also wants to build a dataset for vocal influenza detection. Other researchers are taking a more neurological approach. ""Our studies essentially looked at speech patterns in patients with Parkinson’s disease,"" says Rahul Shrivastav, a speech scientist at Michigan State University. ""People with Parkinson’s experience changes in their voice quality, in the way they produce their sound, so vowels and consonants aren’t clear,"" he says. ""These are very subtle, they aren’t not obvious just listening to it, but with a computer you can do much more."" Shrivastav’s team is in the early stages. So far, they’ve characterized the vocal changes that occur when the disease is more advanced, but they hope to replicate the findings in newly diagnosed patients. This is important, he says, because there’s ""no gold standard test. There’s a whole variety of symptoms that a neurologist will look at and a lot of time they will give the right drugs for Parkinson’s and if the symptoms go away, then that’s what you have."" That process means that patients can go more than a decade without being diagnosed — a reality that voice diagnosis, Shrivastav hopes, will be able to change. some people can't travel to see a neurologist. Voice recordings can help Max Little, a research fellow at MIT and the director of the Parkinson’s Voice Initiative, is also working on developing vocal diagnostic techniques for Parkinson’s. His team can obtain 99 percent accuracy in lab-based diagnostic tests, but Little notes that getting that level of accuracy isn’t ""nearly as easy"" with telephone-quality voice recordings. The group is now working on accurate telephone-based diagnostics. This is crucial, Little says, because many people can’t travel to a neurologist. ""For them, a piece of software running on a smartphone would be perhaps the only lifeline they have to get useful information about their symptoms."" Alzheimer’s disease might also hold a future with vocal diagnostics, said Karmele Lopez de Ipiña, a computer scientist at The University of the Basque Country in Spain, in an email to The Verge. ""The deterioration of spoken language immediately affects the patient’s ability to interact naturally with his or her social environment,"" she said, ""and is usually also accompanied by alterations in emotional responses."" Her team used spontaneous speech analysis to identify features, like speech fluency, to detect Alzheimer’s disease. Combined with an emotional response test, the technique boasts over 90 percent accuracy in discriminating Alzheimer’s patients from healthy controls. The ultimate goal of the research, Lopez de Ipiña said, is to identify the disease before the first clinical symptoms appear. The work done by these researchers differs from Cecchi’s because it relies more heavily on sounds — and the rhythms at which they’re emitted — than on language. Ultimately, however, both approaches rely on computers to analyze the connections that we make in our brains. ""What our studies show is that we can measure mental states analytically without the intervention of a psychiatrist looking at the interview,"" Cecchi says.  eliminating psychologists and physicians isn’t the objective Of course, eliminating psychologists and physicians isn’t the objective. For Cecchi, the goal is to ""codify"" medical interviews for future use, so doctors at different hospitals in different cities, for instance, can make use of the data when a patient moves. ""Psychiatrists don’t have the time to codify or measure in a way that can used by different psychiatrists,"" Cecchi says, adding that ""we aren’t talking about therapy here, but the decision that is made or the diagnosis that’s made after an interview that happens in 30 minutes."" As for Langner and Shrivastav, both believe that their research will help strengthen previous diagnostic procedures by supplying an additional layer of objective testing. ""The goal is to prevent misdiagnosis,"" Langner says. At the moment, a kid diagnosed with ADHD will have been tested using questionnaires and interviews with a doctor. In these instances, Langer says, a doctor’s impressions are crucial. ""In many cases, these are good impressions,"" he says, ""but it still has a great subjective component to it."" Despite promising results, many challenges remain. One limitation is that some speech features are very personal and specific to an individual, Cecchi says. Another is culture. ""European languages have a lot of things in common, not just language, but also culturally,"" he says, adding that his group has done voice analyses on people who speak Portuguese, English, and Spanish with similar results. ""Now, what will happen with Chinese — we don’t know."" Langner hypothesizes that results will vary widely. ""More problems occur when we go to Arabic, Farsi, and Mandarin,"" he says. ""I think if you want to work with these languages, major adjustments will have to be done."" But Shrivastav isn’t so sure. ""There are differences across languages,"" he says, ""but there are some hallmarks of certain diseases that will impact all of the layers in all the conditions, so the trick is to find those changes."" But the most worrisome aspect of this sort of research is probably the hit to privacy. ""With more and more mobile phones, so much speech is being recorded and analyzed, it becomes such an easy signal to access,"" Shrivastav says. ""I think in the next several years you will see a lot more neat things — not just for speech diagnosis."" This is exactly the attitude that some critics worry about: already, researchers are working on a phone app to help doctors predict when someone with bipolar disorder might have a manic episode, so it’s possible that technology will soon be used by the public, and the government. ""An Orwellian 1984 world where our sleepiness state is no longer private."" ""We could suffer from an Orwellian 1984 world where our sleepiness state is no longer private,"" Krajewski said. He thinks health and safety concerns may one day legitimize the use of this technology to monitor emotional and physical states. Someone who has a cold and is waiting for a bus might not be allowed inside the vehicle, for example. ""According to a public-health regulation you will be not allowed to enter public transport — the bus door remains closed for you."" But the potential for that scenario remains years off. It’ll take a lot of time, and myriad willing participants, to unlock the information that our voices carry, Langner says. ""Our brain is a giant network where everything is connected."" This means that if we have problems in one location, it will have consequences in other regions of the brain, ""especially in the parts that control speech projection,"" he says. ""From that we hope that we can find traces of many other illnesses in speech sounds — but to find those solutions will be a very long process.""",0.553738042149111,0.44626195785088896,0.8467206788814051,1718,5.2351571594877768,799,6.7934918648310392,0,0,"Science, Report",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

One of the obvious paths toward resolving that issue is crafting versions of widely used crops that can better grow in harsh environments, and among the big crops that researchers have been looking at is wheat. The genetics of bread wheat have been under investigation for years now, but today a group of researchers is publishing a draft of the crop’s genome, which they say will provide the tools necessary to start planting better wheat.  A faster way to breed just the right wheat “It’s a fairly important information resource for breeding,” Klaus Mayer, lead author of the paper, tells The Verge. Using the genome draft, Mayer says, will allow people who breed wheat “to speed up the breeding to adjust to challenges."" That includes anything from resistance to pathogens to adapting to climate change. This isn’t genetic modification though. Instead, breeders would test their seeds to see if they have the specific genes that they’re looking for, and then breed those seeds with other wheat until they get the perfect mixture. Effectively, it’s a modernized version of what humans have been doing for ages — selectively growing whatever crops work best. Now, it can just be done much more efficiently. The opportunities that Mayer lists are broad because breeders don’t necessarily know how much is possible. Rather than modifying the crops to have a certain trait, breeders are in effect diving back in to the crop’s history, searching for traits that can exist in wheat but have been passed over by genetics in most modern strains. There isn’t any one trait that’s the holy grail for growing wheat, though. Rather, breeders are broadly looking to increase the crop’s yield: improving the ratio of wheat that’s planted to wheat that’s ultimately harvested. But it can take activating one or more of many different traits to actually get there. “This includes things like [resistance against] diseases, pest resistance, anything like that,” Kellye Eversole, executive director of the International Wheat Genome Sequencing Consortium (IWGSC), tells The Verge. ""Also, things for droughts or too much water. It can be almost any aspect.” ""It takes a while to put it all together."" Eversole’s organization, the IWGSC, is responsible for the draft sequence that’s being described today by a paper in Science. It isn’t the very first draft of the bread wheat genome out there, but the consortium’s draft is supposed to more accurately describes where each gene is located, filling in significant limitations on an earlier version. In fact, Mayer himself was a corresponding author on the paper describing those earlier findings. Publishing a draft of the wheat genome is a critical addition to researchers’ growing work on the genetics of plants. Together, wheat, corn, and rice make up the vast majority of grain crops grown in the world. A draft sequence for corn was published in 2008, and a draft for rice was published even longer ago, back in 2002. It’s fair to suspect that these developments could have a big impact on the world’s food supply, should they pan out. In a separate paper published today in Science, researchers from the University of Minnesota write that finding improvements in a few specific regions and crops could actually allow farmers to meet the hunger needs of the earth’s growing population. The paper also places a big focus on the actual yield of wheat, corn, and rice, as well as other leading crops. By improving their yield by 50 percent, it finds, enough calories would be generated to feed an additional 850 million people. Most likely, these gains would come in Africa, Asia, and Eastern Europe. The paper also notes that reducing the nitrogen and phosphorus usage in fertilizers for these crops would help to cull a major source of greenhouse gases. It'll still take years to put together the right genes It’s natural then to accept the IWGSC’s obviously high hopes for what will come next for wheat with the help of their draft. In fact, the consortium says that some breeders have already started using it. Those benefits, however, likely won’t be seen in the immediate future. “It takes a while to put it all together,” says Steve Goff, the lead author on one of the 2002 papers describing the rice genome draft. “A conventional breeder doesn’t necessarily instantly know how to convert a genome into a molecular breeding program. There’s a big technology gap there that needs to be filled.” Companies that think they can make a profit off of wheat will certainly help to fill it. That’s been the case with rice as well, though Goff notes that it’s difficult to say just how much of a difference the genome has made so far: because companies keep their work private, one can’t tell exactly what was done to achieve a certain strain. And even though being able to reference a genome can allow breeders to skip years of work, it could still take upward of 10 years to get the right strain together. Eversole says her hope is for future versions of the genome to help bring that figure down to between three and five years. “We’re still at the beginning of molecular breeding,” Goff says, “but it seems to be working.”",0.6220250707832363,0.3779749292167637,0.8427838330464702,881,4.9988649262202047,457,6.185995623632385,0,0,Science,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The series centers around the importance of filling the gaps in sex work-focused HIV research, and providing sex workers with tools to prevent HIV infection. These steps could not only help reduce HIV infections among sex workers by up to 46 percent in countries like India and Kenya, the researchers say, but they could also help control the HIV pandemic as whole. But to do so, the editors of The Lancet say, governments must decriminalize sex work — there is ""no alternative."" Currently, 116 countries around the world have laws against prostitution, reports Reuters. ""These additional layers of stigma and criminalization that make it such that governments don’t want to engage, and that’s a loss to all of us,"" says Stefan Baral, a physician epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University. The researcher was among those who presented their work last night, and called for increased support for sex workers. More specifically, however, his study discusses the lack of research on male sex workers and HIV. ""we know very little about male sex workers."" ""When you think of a sex worker, the most common picture that comes to mind is a female sex worker,"" says Baral. This is problematic because ""we end up in a dynamic where we know very little about male sex workers."" His study shows that part of the problem surrounding past interventions is that researchers have often tried to target male sex workers by targeting the larger population of men who have sex with men. But male sex workers often don’t identify as either sex workers or gay men, Baral says — largely because of the combined stigma of these labels — so a lot of the interventions that target both groups never reach them. ""Often what’s happened is that people want to oversimplify and generalize the epidemic,"" Baral says, but the reality is that different subpopulations require different forms of interventions. ""We need to accept that."" One possible solution to the problem is to concentrate intervention efforts around the venues that male sex workers frequent, such as parks, clubs, and bars, Baral says. This could go a long way toward improving outreach, and lowering HIV-transmission rates. ""The reality is that if you’ve provided someone with adequate amounts of education and services and they still [engage in risky behaviors], then that’s an issue that we need to explore,"" he says. ""But right now, these men are so underserved that any sort of blame laid upon them isn’t an evidence-based approach."" Linda-Gail Bekker, an infectious disease researcher at the The Desmond Tutu HIV Center in South Africa, also emphasizes the need for decriminalization. ""We want people to be able to access services, to openly discuss their behaviors, to carry the tools and treatment they need to protect themselves, and to do so in a safe and dignified environment,"" she says. Truvada can be taken without a partner's participation In addition to discussing barriers to interventions, her study makes use of mathematical models to demonstrates which interventions are likely to lower HIV infection rates in female sex workers. Among her team’s conclusions is the idea of combining methods like pre-exposure prophylaxis — also known as the anti-HIV pill Truvada — with early HIV treatment. Such a tactic ""could reduce HIV infection rates among sex workers by up to 40 percent."" This finding, she explains, might be linked to the fact that Truvada is taken orally, which means it can be used without a partner’s knowledge. ""Female condoms are, to a certain extent, user controlled, but you still need your partner’s agreement. And male condoms rely heavily on male involvement,"" she says. Truvada, on the other hand, ""can be taken covertly"" if need be. Bekker isn’t suggesting that Truvada be taken as a standalone tool to prevent HIV infection, however — condoms and lubricants are still recommended. But she does think the pill represents a valuable preventative option for women who find themselves in abusive relationships, or in situations in which they have little control. Achieving this sort of female empowerment, however, ""cannot be done in an environment where sex work is criminalized,"" she says. Other researchers focused on less well-studied subgroups of sex workers. In one study, scientists explain why a greater number of HIV interventions should target transgender sex workers. ""In the past, researchers have included trans sex workers in studies of men who have sex with men, or studies of female sex workers — they were invisible,"" said Tonia Poteat, an epidemiologist also at Johns Hopkins University and a co-author of the study, in an email to The Verge. So ""despite the extraordinary burden of HIV among transgender women sex workers,"" there’s very little data on effective HIV prevention, care, or treatment interventions that relate specifically to sex workers who identify as transgender. Transgender sex workers experience different risk factors Poteat’s study also highlights the particular risk factors that transgender sex workers face. These include low self-esteem, substance use, discrimination, and suicidality that stems from societal stigma. Trans sex workers also experience significant biological risks, she said, including illicit hormone and silicone injections with potentially contaminated needles. Moreover, they have a greater likelihood than other sex workers of being a receptive partner during anal sex — a sexual practice that’s more likely to result in transmission than other forms of intercourse. And because so little research has been done on this population, the HIV susceptibility of the neovagina — a vagina created surgically — among trans women who have undergone genital reconstruction remains unknown. ""We must stop conflating men who have sex with men and transgender women,"" Poteat said — in addition to addressing transphobia. Fortunately, scientists have a number of opportunities to turn this trend around, she wrote. ""As we gather more data about effective interventions for prevention of sexual transmission, we have wide-open opportunities to ensure that trans sex workers are included in this research in meaningful ways."" The best way to do so, she explained, is to ensure that data collection includes questions about sex and gender that will, in turn, allow for trans visibility. Given the breadth of the research presented in this series, and its prominence at the AIDS 2014 Conference, the entire publication comes across as triumphant. And it might be just that, as this body of work could give researchers the ammunition they need to demand tailored interventions for sex workers, as well as safer spaces. ""This is one of these times when human rights and science go totally hand in hand,"" Baral says. But the specter of the recent MH17 plane crash, which claimed the lives of six conference attendees, is hard to ignore — especially since at least two of the deceased were strong advocates for increased support for sex workers. Notably, Martine de Schutter was appointed program manager for Bridging the Gaps — an international HIV program that advocates for the decriminalization of sex work, homosexuality, and drug use — in January. And famous HIV researcher Joep Lange, whom Bekker calls a ""personal friend,"" actually spoke out against the barriers that sex work criminalization creates in an article published on July 18th, the day after his death. Lange spoke out against criminalization in an article published after his death ""In some of their countries and some of these settings, it’s just one person driving an agenda around gay men or sex workers, just one really brave human being,"" he says. So, ""losing them is like losing 10 years of work."" HIV researchers and activists are often the only people in a region who listen to, and give voice to, people whose lives are rarely considered in the first place. That’s why the sense of loss among attendees at the AIDS 2014 Conference is indescribable. Still, the researchers who spoke to The Verge say that the crash only serves to strengthen their commitment to the cause. ""accustomed to collaborators and friends dying..."" ""Unfortunately, some of us have become accustomed to collaborators and friends dying from HIV, or even from violence,"" says Stefan Baral, a physician epidemiologist at John Hopkins University. As a result, the predominant attitude of the HIV research community is ""very much that we need to keep looking forward,"" he says, and keep focusing on ending HIV. Yet ""this doesn’t stop the pain of these murders, especially for their family and loved ones."" Bekker noticed a similar resolve among her colleagues this weekend. ""[The crash] has been a huge, huge event here, which has led to a very somber overtone to the conference,"" she says. But ""I’m also very aware of a strong sense of determination"" among the various attendees. Bekker was friends with both Lange and Jacqueline Van Tongeren, the communications director of the Amsterdam Institute for Global Health who died in the crash on Thursday, so the last few days haven’t been easy. Still, she says, ""we need to honor their legacy, to get on with the job and get the science done.""   And that’s exactly what these researchers are doing, starting with disseminating the message that decriminalizing sex work is an essential step in the fight against HIV.",0.7648790670387637,0.23512093296123626,0.8456584687404364,1570,5.2057324840764334,728,6.7184065934065931,0,0,"Science, US & World, Report",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Gox, the largest exchange for trading the virtual currency Bitcoin, started disappearing piece by piece. First the homepage disappeared. Next the support page was pulled, followed by the press releases and then the API. ""The requested page was not found on this server,"" customers were told when they tried to access their deposits. Users started to panic as they realized they might never get their bitcoins back. It had been a rough month for Gox. The company froze customer accounts, citing a technical vulnerability. Now, three weeks later, a leaked internal document revealed that the exchange is more than $100 million dollars in the hole owing to a theft that stole 743,000 bitcoins over the course of years. Gox is more than $100 million dollars in the hole ""A decision was taken to close all transactions for the time being in order to protect the site and our users,"" Gox said in a non-statement. CEO Mark Karpeles has hinted to Reuters that an acquisition announcement could be ""coming soon."" But the company is reportedly being investigated by law enforcement in New York and Tokyo, where it’s based, and things don’t look good. There is no Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation backing Gox’s customers’ deposits. In the event that Bitcoin’s most popular exchange is insolvent, as reports claim, an untold number of customers will have their savings wiped out. Karpeles’ recent statement to an analyst — ""Well, technically speaking it's not 'lost' just yet, just temporarily unavailable"" — was less than reassuring. According to the leaked document, titled ""Crisis Strategy Draft"" and obtained by a Bitcoin blogger, allowing Mt. Gox to fail would be so damaging to Bitcoin at large that anyone holding the currency would be better off bailing them out. All the exchange would need is 200,000 bitcoins from investors and the core community. ""This isn’t about saving Mt. Gox anymore,"" the document says. ""At the risk of appearing hyperbolic, this could be the end of Bitcoin, at least for most of the public."" The total number of bitcoins tied up in Mt. Gox is unknown, but it looks like millions. The theft ultimately stole nearly 6 percent of the bitcoins in the world, a nearly impossible loss to make up without an unprecedented effort. Customers have stepped forward lamenting their losses. Already there is pressure on the rest of the Bitcoin community to make the Mt. Gox users whole, as when the community around the niche virtual currency Dogecoin raised money for the victims of a large hack. So is it true? Is Mt. Gox too big to fail? There is a large community of Bitcoin users who want the currency to succeed long term for idealistic and financial reasons, so a bailout isn’t out of the question. A true Mt. Gox crash could potentially undo some of the progress Bitcoin has made toward mainstream adoption. Already the story of Gox’s shutdown is prompting scaremongering headlines. ""This isn’t about saving Mt. Gox anymore. At the risk of appearing hyperbolic, this could be the end of Bitcoin."" Unfortunately for Gox and its customers, there isn’t much support for a bailout. That’s not surprising given that the ostensible founding premise of Bitcoin was freedom from the inbreeding that caused the global financial crisis and then called upon taxpayers to allay the damage. The prevailing sentiment is that Mt. Gox was an amateur effort with too much power that needed to be eliminated in order to make room for savvier and more responsible players. Mt. Gox had gotten in trouble with one of its US partners, CoinLab, which ended up suing the company for $75 million; later the US government froze $5 million of Mt. Gox’s funds due to suspicion of violating anti-money-laundering regulations. And despite its large stake in Bitcoin, the site struggled with basic technical functions for years after launch. In the summer of 2013 Mt. Gox suspended withdrawals in dollars for murky reasons even as it was supposedly raking in around $60,000 in revenue a day. Now that what’s left of Mt. Gox’s credibility has been shredded, the company is unlikely to rebound even with a bailout from investors or other members of the Bitcoin community. That leaves the question of what comes next. A host of funded exchanges are ready to take its place. But for an exchange to regain users’ trust after the fall of Gox, it will need new transparency standards and safeguards, some of which have already been proposed. Others see currency exchanges as a gap technology that the Bitcoin economy is poised to move beyond. Once people are being paid in Bitcoin and spending money in Bitcoin, there won’t be as much need to buy it for cash, which is the primary function of an exchange. ""These large exchanges that are international and global are more important in the early stages of Bitcoin when we need price discovery,"" says Jon Matonis, director of the Bitcoin Foundation. ""You don’t need them in the long run because in a true Bitcoin economy you’ll have a closed-loop system."" There are precedents for Bitcoin bailouts There are precedents for Bitcoin bailouts, as when the Polish exchange Bitomat accidentally erased all its customers’ bitcoins. Mt. Gox bought the company and reimbursed its customers. But a bailout of Mt. Gox would be contrary to Bitcoin’s libertarian ethos and it doesn’t seem necessary. The price has already rebounded. A number of well-funded, reputable Bitcoin companies are standing by ready to sell the idea to the vast majority of potential users who have never used the currency or heard of Mt. Gox. And anyone who wants a bailout is likely to be shamed by the sense of self-determinism that kickstarted Bitcoin in the first place. ""It's not like this came out of left field,"" says Erik Voorhees, CEO of Coinapault, who had more than 550 bitcoins in Mt. Gox when it collapsed, worth more than $250,000 as of this writing. ""People have known that Mt. Gox sucked for years. I knew that. I knew that I was being foolish keeping money there, and ultimately got burned for it.""",0.1753635470415702,0.8246364529584298,0.8697319590245286,1035,4.9497584541062798,506,6.2648221343873516,0,0,"Business, Policy & Law, US & World, Report",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

The message, which came wedged between numerous texts about a promotion for free roses, said, ""UberX is very close to SURGE. It's Valentine's Day! People will be out all night and we didn't activate new drivers to make earnings even higher this weekend."" Uber’s surge pricing has been a controversial feature of the company’s business for some time. It uses an algorithm to raise and lower the price based on demand. At extremely busy times, especially holidays, rates can be  as many as seven times the normal price. The company's CEO, Travis Kalanick, has been front and center defending this model. ""Surge pricing only kicks in in order to maximize the number of trips that happen and therefore reduce the number of people that are stranded,"" he told Wired in an interview. Kalanick has always maintained that Uber is a neutral party, a technology platform that helps to most efficiently connect drivers and riders. ""We are not setting the price. The market is setting the price. We have algorithms to determine what that market is."" ""We are not setting the price. The market is setting the price."" When Lane heard the Uber text message, he understood it to mean that the company was keeping current drivers off the road, limiting the supply to raise rates. To Lane it seemed Uber was favoring drivers over riders. ""It made me angry, you know,"" says Lane. ""Basically they are trying to rig the system to jack up fares on customers like me."" A law professor briefed on the text message says it may be suspect, given the company’s public framing of surge pricing. ""This certainly sounds deceptive,"" says Arnold Rosenberg, assistant dean at the California Western School of Law in San Diego. ""Something like this violates state laws around unfair business practices as well as Section 5 of the FTC act."" Uber says the whole thing is a misunderstandingUber confirmed the text message, but says the whole thing is a misunderstanding. The company did not artificially restrict the number of drivers who were able to come on to the system on Valentine's Day — a particularly busy day for Uber rides — says spokesman Andrew Noyes. He explained the text simply noted that Uber did not onboard as many  San Diego drivers as they could have that week because in the two weeks prior, a very large number of new drivers were added to the system. Earnings had been low, and the company wanted to reward new drivers with a strong holiday paycheck. In other words, this wasn’t Uber specifically tweaking the number of drivers at a given time to tip things over into a surge. It was a big-picture strategy to make their new drivers happy. Noyes points out that during the week of the 10th, when this trip took place, only 5.6 percent of the trips on the Uber network were affected by surge pricing. ""That is a slap in the face to customers."" Regardless of when and why the additional drivers were withheld, the larger tension still stands: Uber insists that it's a marketplace, a neutral technology platform that works solely to connect drivers and riders with maximal efficiency. But it is also a business, and so may sometimes tilt the scales to keep drivers, its employees and contractors, happy. The company’s explanation didn’t sit well with Lane. ""Honestly it feels worse. Uber specifically withheld supply on a busy holiday weekend even while it predicted that doing so would create significantly higher prices,"" he said. ""Best-case scenario it’s fleecing customers to enrich drivers, worst-case scenario it’s fleecing customers to enrich the broker (Uber). That is a slap in the face to customers.""",0.4707678616719532,0.5292321383280467,0.8184797883288276,720,4.8833333333333337,387,5.9147286821705425,0,0,"Business, Exclusive, Report",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

The Bitcoin exchange probably won't be bailed out, CEO Mark Karpeles will move on, and the rest of the Bitcoin economy will move on as if this was just a bump in the road. But as the community recovers, it's left a single, thorny question unanswered: who took $400 million worth of bitcoins from Mt Gox's vault? The thefts ""went unnoticed for several years."" According to the leaked ""Crisis Strategy Draft,"" the thefts ""went unnoticed for several years,"" which means the attackers had access long before price surges turned Bitcoin into a hot topic for the startup crowd. Almost from the beginning, Mt Gox's accounts were leaking money, and as the currency grew in value, the leak turned into one of the largest bank heists ever — more than 1 out of every 20 bitcoins in the world vanished without a trace. In a system built on technologically assured security and transparency, how could something like this happen? Much of the story doesn't make sense The polite, public explanation for this is that a transaction bug in Mt. Gox’s system enabled the theft, and the team just wasn't sharp enough to spot it — but there's a lot about the story that doesn't make sense. Mt. Gox seems to have been uniquely unprepared for the bug, targeted early, and hit with losses on an unprecedented scale. Other exchanges shut down briefly over the bug, but most reopened within a matter of days and without significant losses. Whoever was exploiting the bug prioritized Mt. Gox over all other targets, maintaining the exploit for years before any red flags were raised. Then there's the scale of the theft: 744,408 bitcoins, roughly 6 percent of all the bitcoins in the world.  Even the sloppiest of audits should have shown that something had gone wrong, that money was flowing out of Gox accounts — but the company didn't call for help until the last possible minute, when the gap had grown so large that it could no longer function. For many, the story just doesn’t add up. Even the sloppiest of audits should have shown that something had gone wrong In recent days, some in the community have even speculated that the heist could have been an inside job. No one has claimed that Karpeles would intentionally steal the coins — Mt. Gox was his baby, after all — but the exchange had as many as 18 employees during various stretches, any of whom could have been aware of the previously published bug. It's still likely that simple incompetence was at fault, especially given recent questions about the exchange's technical competence, but the easily-laundered nature of Bitcoin has made it especially difficult for Mt. Gox to save its tattered reputation. The same problem cropped up for Silk Road 2.0 The same problem cropped up in the Silk Road 2.0's recent hack, which saw $2.7 million going up in smoke, putting the blame on the very same transaction bug. As soon as the hack was announced, users were accusing admins of stealing the money, calling the entire operation nothing more than a honeypot. With the money disappeared into bitcoin laundering devices and increasingly tiny trails in the public ledger, there's no way to know for sure. The getaway, however tricky, has already happened. Whoever made the withdrawals performed one of the biggest heists in historyAnd if some in the community have doubts, the tone of the past few weeks reflects it. The turn against Gox has been strong and sudden, with intimations of not just incompetence but corruption. It reflects something more than just well-meaning developers in over their heads. One statement from competing exchanges referred to Gox as ""bad actors that need to be weeded out,"" and in private conversations, others have referred to it straightforwardly as a cancer on the community. The sense of betrayal is personal and palpable. If we ever find the real culprits for Gox or Silk Road 2.0 it will happen using the old-fashioned tools of the criminal justice system. Already, the same US Attorney prosecuting the Silk Road case has started to investigate Gox, calling in various Bitcoin businesses to see if there's a case to be made. Everyone involved is being watched very closely, on the bet that a sum of money that size won't stay hidden for long. But whoever made the withdrawals just performed one of the biggest heists in history — and they may still get away clean.",0.2116899336736153,0.7883100663263847,0.8492442569739462,760,4.8236842105263156,409,5.8410757946210268,0,0,"Business, Report",0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

A fun side project has become a full business The product was built by Alex Taub and Michael Schonfeld, two startup employees trying to have fun in their spare time. They didn't feel like maintaining the service, so after a few weeks, they shut it down. They left the landing page up with a note to former users and moved on to their next project. ""We figured it was a fun flash in the pan, but it seemed like every week an email or two would roll in from brands that wanted to use this thing as a real tool,"" says Taub.

The bill would have ended the controversial phone record metadata collection by the NSA, but the Senate was not in favor of rolling back any of the NSA's broad surveillance powers. While telephone companies would have still collected the data in question, the records would have stayed in the hands of the phone companies and a new type of court order would have been needed by the government to access these records. Additionally, companies would no longer have been required to hold onto their records longer than they ordinarily would have for normal business purposes. Congress will need to act by next June However, new legislation around this program will still be required despite the Senate's vote today. Next June, the legal basis for the phone record collection program as part of the Patriot Act will expire — so new legislation will be required if the NSA wants to have continued easy access to these records. Originally, the USA Freedom Act was meant to be not just a way to ban bulk collection under Section 215 but a multi-pronged reform bill, incorporating changes to how the government managed national security letters and internet surveillance. But a series of amendments to the House version weakened it, until a last-minute change watered it down to the point that some privacy advocates withdrew support. The bill passed, but Leahy promised to roll back the biggest changes with his own Senate version, which was introduced this summer. Leahy's bill, to many, is a major and welcome improvement. One of the most important differences is its definition of the ""specific selection terms"" that NSA agents use to look for call records: the House version left the phrasing nebulous, while the Senate adds several qualifiers, including an explicit ban on searching for broad terms like entire cities or area codes. The EFF worries that it could still be twisted by the intelligence community, but it still decided it was by far the better option, given that ""essentially, the House bill left it up to the intelligence agencies,"" as Elizabeth Goitein, co-director of the NYU Brennan Center for Justice's Liberty and National Security Program, puts it. The bill also includes better transparency measures for national security letters and covers a wider range of phone surveillance tactics than the narrowly focused House bill. ""You can't push it too far without losing critical support from both sides"" It may also be less likely to get amended into uselessness. Leahy boasts of having groups that ranged from the ACLU to the NRA on board with the bill, and the White House put its weight behind the bill yesterday, calling it ""a reasonable compromise that enhances privacy and civil liberties and increases transparency."" And the Reform Government Surveillance coalition, which includes Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and others, is unsurprisingly urging its passage. The bill is ""a rare creature,"" says Goitein, ""and you can't push it too far without losing that critical support from both sides."" It's also coming some six months before the sunset of the Patriot Act, which justifies phone surveillance. If Congress can't approve a surveillance reform bill that explicitly keeps Section 215 around, it might expire altogether, something the White House warns would remove ""critical authorities."" Obama has promised to end bulk collection of phone records, but his administration has repeatedly had the order that allows it reauthorized, albeit with more restrictions on how intelligence agencies can search the database. It's also fighting over the program's legality in court. A federal appeals court recently heard arguments over whether collecting bulk phone records in court is unconstitutional, following a decision by one judge who condemned the program.",0.6110827580686748,0.38891724193132515,0.6454866345831417,634,5.1577287066246056,352,6.1676136363636367,0,0,"Policy & Law, US & World",0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

We've seen the first medical marijuana ad on television, the first rules governing how banks handle the money coming from dispensaries, and even the first weed publishing vertical at an established newspaper. Now the world's first international marijuana brand is being created — and it will use Bob Marley's likeness to promote it. According to The Guardian, Marley's family is working with private equity firm Privateer Holdings to create a company called Marley Natural. Its focus will be on distributing ""heirloom Jamaican cannabis strains"" of marijuana, but will also offer other things like creams and accessories emblazoned with the company's branding and the reggae star's name. Though the company will be rooted in New York City — where marijuana is only decriminalized at the moment — the plan is to grow, distribute, and sell it in areas where the plant is legal by the end of 2015. The other branded products will be available worldwide.  The move would likely increase the already staggering amount of money that has been posthumously made in Marley's name — the music icon's likeness has already been used on so many things like shirts and bags that last month Forbes ranked him as the fifth-highest paid dead celebrity, earning his family an estimated $20 million over the last year alone. Michael Jackson topped that list with earnings in the area of $140 million, but considering the number of states legalizing marijuana and the support shown in surveys about the acceptance of legalization (like this one from the Pew Research Center), there's a good chance that gap would decrease. Marley is already the fifth-highest paid dead celebrity That's not even considering the amount of money involved in counterfeited Marley merchandise, too. In 2011, Billboard magazine ran a cover story called ""The Business of Bob Marley"" which theorized that the unlicensed usage of Marley's likeness had generated hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue over the years. Aligning Marley's official likeness with an international marijuana brand would not only make obvious cultural sense, but could also help reign in some of that lost money.

Both parties skirted the rules by making campaign information public, rather than passing it directly to groups disallowed from receiving it, but by including the decoder needed to understand the information, the Democrats may be able to claim that they followed regulations more closely than the Republicans. Paul S. Ryan, a lawyer for the nonpartisan watchdog Campaign Finance Center, told The Huffington Post that @AdBuyDetails bio decoder was ""critical"" to be able to understand the tweets, and said that the party's lawyers could argue that ""all of the information was made available on the Twitter feed.""

The initiative, implemented under the president's executive authority, promises to stop deportation and provide work permits for nearly five million undocumented immigrants. It also includes minor tweaks to streamline the green card process for visa holders, but Silicon Valley executives have expressed dismay that the plan doesn't do more to keep skilled foreign workers in the US. ""I will make it easier and faster for high-skilled immigrants, graduates and entrepreneurs to stay and contribute to our economy, as so many business leaders have proposed,"" Obama said during a 15-minute televised address Thursday night.  Under the president's plan, visa holders will be able to change employers while applying for green cards, and spouses of some H-1B visa holders will be eligible for work permits. The H-1B is a temporary visa that allows skilled foreign workers in certain sectors to stay in the US for up to six years. Technology companies and lobbyists have long been pushing for an expansion of the H-1B program, which currently limits issued visas to 65,000 per year, arguing that the quota keeps them from hiring talented engineers. Last year, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg launched a bipartisan group, FWD.us, aimed at overhauling the immigration system, with support from other leading Silicon Valley executives.

""The way the regulations are drafted today there's a lot of room for improvement."" Others were disappointed that the president didn't take stronger action to streamline the green card process for current H-1B holders.

""He could have taken steps to make it easier for skilled immigrants to become Americans through the green card system, protecting foreign workers and Americans in the process.""

It's basically an anti-virus scan, but the bugs it's looking for are really nasty. They're advanced bugs, designed to hijack your accounts and eavesdrop on your Skype calls, typically used by countries like Bahrain, Egypt, and Vietnam to crack down on people they don't like. If you found spyware on your computer tomorrow, the NSA would not help you It's unlikely that anyone reading this has been targeted by one of these bugs, but it's worth thinking about what would happen if you were. The US government is spending tens of billions of dollars a year to defend the nation from digital attacks, so you might imagine that it would come to your rescue, in the same way it would if a squad of North Korean commandos tried to abduct you from your home. But cyberspace works by different rules. There’s no border to defend, no idea of national sovereignty. To the network, the Egyptian secret police don’t look that different from run-of-the-mill Russian scammers. So if you found spyware on your computer tomorrow, the NSA would not help you. Maybe you could reach someone at the FBI who cared, but I wouldn't bet on it. US Cyber Command is designed to defend military and government infrastructure. When James Clapper talks about defending the nation from cyberattack, these are the people he means. Everyone else is on their own. When the New York Times was attacked by state-sponsored Chinese hackers in 2013, it was a private firm called Mandiant that dug them out, not law enforcement. As governments build more and more sophisticated defenses, they also turn more and more towards relatively defenseless civilian targets. The result is governments on both sides hacking civilians, and no one bothering to play defense. What's the arms race good for if it can't protect people? In fact, most of the cyberdefense money is actively making things worse. The techniques behind these weapons were all actively developed by organizations like the NSA before trickling out to more oppressive regimes. The same agencies are lobbying against encryption that might protect your conversations from being stolen, and planting backdoors in the algorithms you might use to encrypt your files. They're buying up software vulnerabilities and keeping them secret, leaving the door open for anyone who discovers them in the future. I don't expect anyone reading this will find anything on their computer — just like I don't expect to be abducted by North Korean commandos. But laying it out, I find myself getting angry. If cyber-defense isn't about defending you, then what's it about? Why are we developing and deploying these weapons if we can't defend against them? What's the arms race good for if it can't protect people? But these are weapons, and weapons are their own reason. This logic is why groups like Amnesty don't like the term ""cyberwar."" War makes it sound like two sides, America vs. China, each playing offense and defense together. But the reality is all offense, all collateral damage. We're building better and better weapons, protecting the most powerful parts of society from attack, then leaving everyone else to fend for themselves.

Which is why I'm very excited about him potentially starring in a remake of John Carpenter's Big Trouble in Little China.  A perfect fit for an actor that flexed out of an arm cast The Wrap first broke the news that Johnson is in negotiations to star in a remake of the film, which back in 1986 featured Kurt Russell as a smirking, would-be action hero fighting supernatural forces in San Francisco's Chinatown. The movie was considered a box-office failure at the time, but went on to become a beloved cult classic, and its oddball mixture of martial arts, comedy, and tongue-in-cheek bravado could be a perfect fit for an actor who earlier this year flexed his way out of an arm cast. The new Big Trouble in Little China is being written by the team of Ashley Miller and Zack Stentz, who previously worked on Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles, X-Men: First Class, and the forthcoming Power Rangers movie. Of course, the downside is that the remake could end up being a disappointing and cynical misfire like so many recent 1980s remakes (RoboCop and Poltergeist, right this way; your table is ready). But with Big Trouble in Little China, you're starting with a property that already has the goofiness and camp turned to 11 — just check out the trailer below — so the two likeliest outcomes are awesome, and more awesome.

Jenner has been in the public eye for the majority of her life, and has made the difficult, but important decision to embrace her identity, even if it means risking the acceptance of a public that's grown up with one very specific idea of her. And for the generation of people who didn't know Bruce Jenner as an Olympian, but rather as the soft-spoken father on Keeping Up with the Kardashians, Caitlyn is a sign that gender transition is not wrong or surreal, but can be just one part of a complex life.

There were hollers and applause — a career like his warrants that — and he went on to explain that a couple of years ago he got together with some friends to shoot what he described as a love letter to the island of Hawaii. Sure, there had been some bad buzz, including some particularly damning leaked emails from Sony Pictures executives along the way, but ""never did the movie cease to be anything more than a love letter."" He might as well have just said, Keep your expectations low on this one. A landslide of horrible reviews and a sixth-place, $10 million opening weekend later, Crowe’s new film Aloha is dead on arrival — and with good reason. It’s inarguably the worst film of his directorial career, the story of a military contractor (Bradley Cooper) heading up the launch of a satellite in Hawaii, where he ends up romantically ping-ponging between his now-married ex (Rachel McAdams) and a quarter-Chinese, quarter-Hawaiian Air Force pilot named Allison Ng (played, rather inexplicably, by Emma Stone). It’s a bizarre film, narratively incoherent at times, that makes so many herky-jerky leaps in genre and tone that it feels like three different films got tossed into a Vitamix and turned into a foul movie smoothie.  It’s also the latest in a string of films over the past 15 years that have slowly been chipping away at Crowe’s status as the earnest, rock n’ roll cinematic voice of a generation. Given that his pedigree was earned with seminal films like Say Anything…, Almost Famous, and Jerry Maguire, it’s enough to make you wonder just what the hell’s happening. Early versions included human sacrifice and volcanoes Aloha first started struggling to life back in 2008, under the name Deep Tiki. Back then it was going to star Ben Stiller and Reese Witherspoon, but the project eventually got pushed, and Crowe ended up making the Matt Damon comedy We Bought A Zoo instead. That may have been a good thing, because at the time, the script for Deep Tiki had started to develop a reputation for some rather eccentric story elements — including a human sacrifice into a volcano. However, several years later Crowe ended up reworking the script, eventually resulting in Aloha. While that might seem indicative of somebody that’s running thin on ideas, that kind of iterative, exploratory creative process isn’t anything new for Crowe. He’s always been very open about his process as a writer, churning through draft upon draft before finding the right way to tell a given story. Early versions of Almost Famous centered around a fake British rock band before he decided to mine his own family’s story and dreamt up Stillwater; Singles had been floating around for years before the death of Mother Love Bone’s Andy Wood inspired Crowe to center the film around the Seattle music scene. It might be messy, but it results in films — and scripts — that are utterly singular.  While considering Crowe’s recent films, I revisited the script for Jerry Maguire. I’d intended to read just through the opening, but that quick skim turned into a marathon read. Crowe’s best work is propulsive. It soars, with an unmistakeable voice and romanticism that he first touched upon in 1982 with Fast Times at Ridgemont High and refined into its arguable high point in 2000’s Almost Famous. It’s a mix that’s both smart and clever, with a self-assuredness that allows Crowe to break storytelling conventions while always letting the audience know they’re in safe hands. Crowe’s best work soars with an unmistakeable voice and romanticism As Almost Famous hit theaters, Crowe told Salon that he was ready to move beyond the themes of adolescence that had dominated his work thus far. ""So there are things that have happened over the last five or six years that I really want to write about that are basically adult themes,"" he said at the time — and it’s been bumpy ever since. Vanilla Sky saw Crowe stretch as a director, pulling off a darker, more sinister tone and more stylized visuals than he’d ever attempted before. But the approach clashed with his signature practice of using classic rock tunes to highlight essential emotional beats, and many great moments were cribbed from Abre Los Ojos, the Spanish film that inspired Sky. The result was a movie that was narratively complex by design, but emotionally impregnable; the anti-Cameron Crowe movie.  Doubling down on his new theme of choice — men seeking redemption — Crowe turned out Elizabethtown in 2005 and then We Bought a Zoo in 2011. The former was an attempt at  melding the framework of Jerry Maguire with the personal introspection of Almost Famous, and delivered on neither (inspiring the term ""manic pixie dream girl"" will likely be its longstanding cultural legacy). The latter was an inoffensive and workmanlike family film, but largely lacked the sparkle and joyfulness that was so infectious in Crowe’s earlier films. The arc of a talented artist wrestling with new themes Taken together, it’s the arc of a talented artist wrestling with new themes and storytelling conceits in a way he never has before — a creative struggle that finally collapsed upon itself with Aloha.  In an email leaked as part of the Sony hacks, then-Sony Pictures co-chair Amy Pascal stated that she would never start a movie again ""when the script is ridiculous"". Perhaps that kind of pushback from studio heads will aid Crowe in getting things back on track (or perhaps he’ll have the opportunity to direct one of the projects he’s already written on for years, like his much-delayed Marvin Gaye biopic). Maybe jumping to a different medium, like he’s doing with his Showtime pilot Roadies, will do the trick. Whatever it takes, I’ll be rooting for Crowe. Because even in between Aloha’s most inexplicable moments, there are flashes of his brilliance; fleeting scenes filled with refreshing honesty. At one point in the film, Bradley Cooper and John Krasinski’s characters make nice with each other in a totally silent dance of looks, shrugs, and suburban alpha male pantomime, and the entire theater was laughing despite how poorly the rest of the movie had played. Cameron Crowe has a voice in film like no other, and I hope he continues to be bold, experiment, and find new ways to tell stories he cares about. I just hope they turn out a lot better than Aloha.",0.6124977532262765,0.38750224677372347,0.16079775303935237,1104,4.9356884057971016,609,6.1231527093596059,0,0,"Culture, Entertainment, Essay, Film",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

According to the Financial Times, Apple and Samsung are in discussions with mobile carriers to help develop and implement a new SIM card standard that could make it easier to switch between service providers. The report refers to the new standard as an embedded SIM — or an e-SIM — which would remain inside the phone and give consumers the ability to switch carriers without getting a new card, rather than locking them into a specific carrier, as they do now. That means no more swapping SIMs to switch phones or carriers; it would all be done through an interface on the device.  No more swapping SIMs The new standard is expected to be ready sometime in 2016, but we've already seen Apple take a step toward this type of card. Last year, it introduced LTE iPads that included something called the Apple SIM, which offered people a choice between multiple carriers and in some cases the ability to switch carriers when they liked. Getting rid of the SIM card tray, if not also the SIM card itself, would give Apple and other phone manufacturers the ability to make their devices a bit thinner, which is something they'll like however slight the difference is. The Financial Times reports that it doesn't expect the Apple SIM to disappear just yet — it's entirely possible that it could show up in an iPhone before the e-SIM arrives. The GSM Association, an industry group that represents mobile operators, tells the Financial Times that ""the majority of operators"" are on board with the shift over to e-SIM. That reportedly includes AT&T, T-Mobile owner Deutsche Telekom, Vodafone, Telefonica, and Orange, as well as other international carriers. The association confirmed Apple and Samsung's participation in developing the new standard, but the companies' involvement may not yet be final. The association says of Apple: ""While we are optimistic, a formal agreement with them is still in progress."" It'll be interesting to see how the embedded SIM plays out, as the big carriers aren't likely to love it. Already, we've seen AT&T interfering with Apple's Apple SIM plans, while smaller carriers like T-Mobile and Sprint seem to embrace how easily it allows iPad owners to switch providers, giving them a better chance of luring away competitors' customers. Apple is likely a large presence in all of this: it's wanted to see the SIM disappear for some time now, and it seems that it has the power — for the most part — to get carriers on board.",0.7314515390968224,0.26854846090317763,0.25686079564908254,432,4.8194444444444446,241,5.8340248962655599,0,0,"Apple, Mobile, Tech",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The idea of an artificial intelligence coach that learns over time sounded promising, but it came in a bulky, prototype package. Today, Moov has announced a much better-looking version of its AI-enhanced wearable: the Moov Now. This time around the wearable comes in a much smaller package and pops into a more breathable, sweat-friendly strap. It uses a replaceable battery that lasts six months, and it pairs to your phone over Bluetooth. There's no screen or indicator light on the Moov Now, but otherwise in many ways it's similar to other fitness trackers — it can count steps and calculate the amount of calories you've burned. ""Correct my form instead of just telling me how many steps I took today."" What makes Moov Now different is the way it interprets that data, according to Meng Li, one of the company's co-founders. ""We just feel like we had to go beyond the data,"" she says. ""It’s not enough. We’re human. We like stories, we like insights. We’re not like machines."" Li thinks that, while wearables do a good job gathering raw data, the apps we use need to be smarter about what that data means. ""Tell me the things I need to do, give guidance, tell me what I did wrong, and correct my form instead of just telling me how many steps I took today,"" Li says. The original Moov could do all of those things, but Li says Moov Now does them better, despite the smaller package. The team built specific apps for five different activities: running, swimming, cycling, boxing, and timed workouts. Each mode came with its own tailor-made programs, which were built with help from coaches at Stanford University, and there are more than 200 variations to choose from. Moov won't just track your running — the AI will guide you through endurance or sprint programs, encouraging you along the way but also calling you out if it notices you doing something wrong. ""It has a personality,"" Li laughs. I got to see some of that personality during a demo of the new Moov at our office. ""I'll guide you step by step through this first one,"" the AI coach says to Nikola Hu, another Moov co-founder. ""We're aiming for at least 188 steps per minute today."" Hu is jogging in place, but his pace is too slow, so the AI prods him again. ""You are averaging 154 steps per minute. It should be at least 188."" An increasingly out of breath Hu shoots Li a look. ""Did you turn off reduced coaching?"" Hu asks. His question is indicative of the fair amount of control Moov offers. If you never want to look at your phone's screen during a workout, you don't have to — just let the AI guide you with audible prompts. If those prompts start to nag, you can turn on that reduced coaching option to slow their frequency. There are different difficulty levels in every program, from beginner to advanced.  Moov Now photosPreviousNextView full GalleryPreviousNext While Moov is all about the AI during your workout, you can still access all the data behind that machine learning when you're back in the app. You can track your sleep, review past workouts, and monitor your daily activity, much like you can with other fitness apps. Another thing that differentiates Moov Now from its competitors is its ability to recognize movement in three-dimensional space. Hu demonstrates this capability for me by doing some office boxing. The punches he's throwing are showing up in real time on the iPhone screen that his Moov devices are paired to. It's impressive — there's basically zero lag. He switches from this demo mode to a Guitar Hero-type game where he has to jab and uppercut in time with a beat. The sensors are good enough to recognize the different moves, even if he's falling behind again, something the AI coach reminds him of. The fitness tracking market is dominated by companies like Jawbone and Fitbit, but the longer they keep fighting each other in court, the longer their competition has to catch up. Moov isn't completely unique — other startups have attempted similar feats. But the first version of Moov pushed the company beyond the crowdfunding phase. The Moov Now is its first real chance at retail success. The company is taking preorders starting today, with the Moov Now temporarily priced at $59. It will retail for $99 when devices start shipping in the fall.",0.4550472149239496,0.5449527850760504,0.18224361891828345,776,4.7216494845360826,426,5.793427230046948,0,0,"Apps, Tech",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Asus is looking to upend expectations with its new Chromebook Flip, a device that feels more premium than its price lets on — it’s metal — and one that lets you flip its screen around into various modes that make the whole experience feel more unique than your everyday clamshell laptop. The above-average build quality and other pluses don’t mean the Chromebook Flip is the best Chromebook you can buy; it’s not. But that doesn’t make it a bad choice.  At $279 (you should avoid the cheaper model with less memory), it’s very affordable — but then most Chromebooks are. And so far, Asus hasn’t struck the balance between price and quality in the same way that Acer and Toshiba have. But the Chromebook Flip shows that the company is getting there.   Out of the box, the Flip makes a strong first impression. A brushed aluminum chassis is the foundation of the machine’s impressive-for-the-price construction. That doesn’t come at the cost of heft; the Flip weighs in at 1.96 pounds and is easy to carry anywhere or toss into a bag. Everything on the outside is tastefully designed, with two speakers placed at the bottom front, your usual lineup of ports (2 USB, microSD, micro-HDMI, headphone jack), and even physical volume controls on the right side. Those come in handy when you’re using the Flip like a tablet. But Asus loses some points for the proprietary charger, and if you’re the clumsy type, plastic Chromebooks may still be a wiser option. The Flip took a single, two-foot spill during my time with it that was enough to permanently deform one of its metal corners. (It still worked fine afterwards.) The Flip’s hinge is very sturdy and stayed that way throughout my testing. That’s reassuring considering how often you may be switching it between traditional laptop, tablet, stand, and a ""tent"" mode that I could never really find any good use for. But the other configurations definitely prove convenient depending on where you’re using the Flip. It’s small enough to allow the keyboard out in almost every situation, but the stand mode, which props the display up with the keys facing down, makes for a great way to watch Netflix or YouTube in bed. But then you get to the screen, and it’s here where Asus stumbles. The display already feels small at 10.1 inches, but that limited real estate is made all the more obvious by a big black bezel surrounding it on all sides. This makes some sense considering you’ll sometimes be holding the Flip with both hands on the screen, but it’s still a strike against the Chromebook aesthetically. Rating the display’s quality, I’d call it so-so. Other than a noticeably warm white balance, colors are accurate, vibrant, and pleasant overall thanks to the IPS panel. But even in a form factor this small, my eyes struggled with tolerating the Chromebook Flip’s 1280 x 800 resolution. When you’ve got it on a desk and use it like any other Chromebook, it’s totally passable. But it’ll be closer to your face in tablet mode, and that’s where things get pixely. In a world of Retina and quad-HD displays, it’s impossible to ignore. But it’s also worth remembering this thing’s price: there aren’t many $300 products with gorgeous, super sharp screens out there. Considering where the Chromebook Flip sits in the market, what you get here shouldn’t be any surprise. And for plenty of people, it’ll work just fine — especially if you’ve not yet been spoiled by higher resolutions. In terms of touchscreen response, the Chromebook Flip was satisfactory and I rarely noticed missed taps or other hitches.  The Flip’s keyboard is a mixed bag. It’s quiet and offers decent enough travel to where my hands never felt strained. But it’s pretty crammed, and coming to this from my regular 15-inch laptop was a recipe for typos. Eventually I adjusted somewhat, but I never felt totally confident that I’d be able to type without errors. But the touchpad is great! And that was a nice surprise for a Chromebook at this price. It’s just the right size considering the Flip’s overall footprint; it’s smooth, makes a satisfactory click when you press it, and was always very responsive during my time using it. Somehow these cheap Chromebooks keep lapping more expensive Windows laptops when it comes to touchpads. As for performance, the Chromebook Flip’s Rockchip processor can handle common tasks without any major issues or drastic slowdowns. Does it stand up to Google’s supercharged (and priced accordingly) Pixel? Well no, of course not. The sweet spot for tabs in Chrome seemed to be around 10 in my testing, though you’ll definitely notice some stuttering when scrolling down pages before they’ve fully loaded. Some, like the New York Times homepage, always proved jittery no matter what. Once you get up near 20, the Flip really starts to wrestle with keeping it all going. Here again I’ll remind you to stay away from the 2GB version Asus is selling for $249. You’ll save money, but the drop in usability will destroy any allure this Chromebook has going for it. Memory  makes a huge difference when you’re multitasking between Spotify, Google Docs, Gmail, Twitter, Facebook, and on and on and on. To its credit, the Chromebook Flip shows strong longevity, generally meeting the 9-hour battery life that Asus promises.  Chrome OS itself remains largely unchanged since our last few reviews. By now, you’ve probably got some idea of whether Google’s all-things-in-the-cloud software is right for you. (With the Chromebook Flip, you’ll get 100GB of cloud storage for two years.) Chromebooks are for web browsing; they’re for document editing; they’re for messaging; they’re for emailing. Despite the improvements Google has made, Chromebooks still aren’t right for photographers and other professionals who rely on intensive editing tools. But aside from the ludicrous Pixel, you should already know that, based on how cheap most of them are. Google is working to make it easier for Chromebooks to double as tablets, too. The Material Design-style virtual keyboard is pleasant to use (with full emoji and handwriting support), and you can run a tiny list of Android apps like Evernote and Vine alongside your Chrome web apps, which helps some. But if a true tablet experience is what you want, this Chrome OS convertible just isn’t as compelling as an iPad or Nexus 9. Holding onto the keys on the back never stops feeling awkward, for one, and the software just isn’t there yet. I’d stick to using the Chromebook Flip in its regular clamshell (for work) and stand (for entertainment) modes.  If you want the best Chromebooks available today, those remain the Toshiba Chromebook 2 or the Acer Chromebook 15. But the Chromebook Flip makes a strong argument for ""good enough"" despite minuses like a just-okay screen and average performance. The impressive build quality, great trackpad, and portability of this 10-inch convertible could (and probably should) push it above the sea of Chromebooks at the default price point between $200 and $300.",0.6461470710943062,0.35385292890569375,0.16725628152711483,1217,5.0164338537387021,641,6.049921996879875,0,0,"Google, Tech, Review",1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

""We have been able for the first time to create a biological pacemaker using minimally invasive methods and to show that the new pacemaker suffices to support the demands of daily life,"" Eduardo Marbán, a cardiologist at the Cedars-Sinai Heart Institute and lead author of the study, told the press yesterday. The approach is practical, added Eugenio Cingolani, a cardiogeneticist also at Cedars-Sinai and a co-author of the study, because ""no open-heart surgery is required to inject this gene."" In the study, researchers injected a gene called Tbx18 into the pigs’ hearts. This gene, which is also found in humans, reprogrammed a small number of heart-muscle cells into cells that emit electrical impulses and drive the beating of the heart. The area in which this change occurred — about the size of a peppercorn — doesn't normally initiate heartbeats. ""We were able to get the biological pacemaker to turn on within 48 hours,"" Marbán said. To get the gene to the heart, the researchers sent a modified virus into the right ventricle through a catheter. The viral vector isn’t harmful, the researchers said, because the virus they employed was engineered to be ""replication deficient"" — meaning that it will not reproduce and spread beyond the heart. Overall, the results of the study demonstrate that the pigs who received the gene therapy experienced an increase in heart rate that allowed them to be much less dependent on backup pacemakers. In contrast, the backup pacemakers were responsible for more than 40 percent of the beats in pigs who didn’t receive the gene therapy, but still underwent surgery. Two weeks isn't ""a magic cap."" Unfortunately, it appears that the increased heart rates of the treated pigs tapered off toward the end of the two-week period. This, the researchers say, doesn't mean that the therapy couldn't last longer. ""Based on the data showing in the paper or the unpublished results,"" Marbán said, ""we don’t have any reason to believe... that the two weeks is somehow a magic cap."" ""The study’s novel since it was done in a large animal. It’s also a really clever approach,"" says Ira Cohen, a cardiac electrophysiologist at Stony Brook University in New York who did not participate in the study. Cohen explains that this study is different from previous attempts at producing ""biological pacemakers"" because the scientists didn’t use stem cells. The study also differs from previous efforts because instead of being aimed at permanently replacing mechanical pacemakers, it offers temporary support for people with infections while doctors wait to replace their devices. ""Currently, a temporary pacemaker is placed for this indication, but implantation of additional hardware isn't an ideal solution given the high likelihood for reinfection,"" researchers at UT Southwestern Medical Center explained in an accompanying article published in Science today. This means that this type of gene therapy could curb the need for a temporary device, and reduce the likelihood of reinfection. Two percent of people with pacemakers in the US experience infection An estimated 2 percent of people with pacemakers in the US experience an infection at some point, Marbán explained. ""And some sizeable fraction of those 2 percent would go on to need revision of the system, and presumably this kind of bridge from one device to another."" Marbán also thinks the therapy might help doctors treat congenital heart block in fetuses, because surgeons can’t implant pacemakers in the womb. ""Even though it’s rare,"" Marbán said, ""we offer this as a potentially life-saving procedure in those babies in which there’s no other therapeutic option."" But there might be an ""enormous surgical effect."" But Cohen also raised questions about certain aspects of the study. For one, the researchers didn’t report the pigs’ initial heart rates. This makes it hard to evaluate the effectiveness of the therapy, he says, because the pigs who weren’t treated with Tbx18 also experienced an increase in heart rate over the two-week period. ""Either there’s an enormous surgical effect,"" or the pigs’ heart rates were very high to begin with, Cohen says, which means it might not be the best model of human health. Cohen also thinks the study would have been more convincing if the pigs were experiencing infections at the time of the intervention. ""Why wouldn’t you create an animal model that’s infected if you want to replace an infected site?"" he asks. Still, ""I give [the researchers] enormous credit for looking for short-term solutions, and enormous credit for the advancement to actually differentiate these cells into pacemaker cells."" ""Why wouldn’t you create an animal model that’s infected if you want to replace an infected site?""  The researchers hope to try the therapy on humans within the next three years. But the scientists couldn't estimate what the therapy might eventually cost, because ""we’re developing it in the initial incidence for very narrow niche indications for which there’s no comparable therapy,"" Marbán said, adding that he hopes to expand the uses of the work to the entire population of people with pacemakers. ""If you look at the natural history of other first-in-class treatments for heart-rhythm disorders, they start with the most arcane and difficult cases, and then ultimately they become generalized to be able to treat hundreds of thousands of patients,"" he said. ""We wouldn’t be surprised if that’s the path that this takes."" A lot is riding on the success of this approach From a medical research standpoint, a lot is riding on the success of this approach, Cohen says. ""There has been a lot of promise and a lot of hype surrounding regenerative medicine, but  there have been very few successes."" So, even if the resulting application ends up being a relatively small success, given the small population it might serve, ""this would basically be saying that we are doing something with the dollars that have been invested."" That’s why Cohen, who considers himself a competitor, thinks it’s ""incredibly important"" that something in this field makes it to clinical trials. ""It could be the core that allows people who are on medical review boards to point to the fact that we do, indeed, have a therapy.""",0.20217095599653773,0.7978290440034623,0.3450031888368334,1109,5.2569882777276824,533,6.5778611632270172,0,0,"Science, Report",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

The study, published in The Journal of Neuroscience today, relates how the researchers were able to alter a common human alcohol target — a molecular channel that binds alcohol in the brain — in Caenorhabditis elegans worms by modifying the worm’s genetic makeup. This, the researcher say, is the first example of scientists modifying a human alchohol target to successfully prevent intoxication in an animal. drunk worms crawl more slowly and don't wiggle as much Normally, when worms are put in a petri dish that contains alcohol, they become drunk. For a worm, this mean not being able to wiggle from side to side as much. It also means crawling much more slowly. But with the modified channel, the worms acted just as they did without the alcohol. The researchers were able to do this by tweaking the human alcohol target just enough to prevent ""a research model worm from getting drunk,"" said Jonathan Pierce-Shimomura, a neuroscientist at the University of Texas at Austin and a co-author of the study, in an email to The Verge. Moreover, ""the way we tweaked it did not perturb the normal function of the target, allowing it continue functioning normally in the worm's brain,"" Pierce-Shimomura said. This is important because the channel that the researchers modified — called the BK channel SLO-1 — also plays a role in regulating the activity of blood vessels, neurons, and the urinary tract. ""It is remarkable that [a] mutation … could have such a dramatic specific effect on ethanol modulation while minimally affecting basal BK channel function,"" the researchers wrote in the study. ""We tried a brute force approach, testing hundreds of mutations."" To find this target, Pierce-Shimomura and his team proceeded largely by trial-and-error. ""We tried a brute force approach, testing hundreds of mutations to empirically determine which one would allow the BK channel to function normally [while still] preventing alcohol from activating it."" Eventually, they stumbled upon a genetic modification of the channel that stopped it from activating in the presence of ethanol. This effect is very different from ""Asian flush"" or ""alcohol flush reaction,"" a condition that causes certain people, mostly of Asian descent, to process alcohol inefficiently. ""Asian flush is due to slow metabolism of alcohol which produces a by-product called acetyladehyde,"" Pierce-Shimomura explained. ""This is a poison, so people with Asian flush are being poisoned when they drink alcohol."" The researchers now hope to develop drugs that would have the same effect in mice — and eventually humans. ""We found a way that future drugs may target a single human brain protein, called the BK channel, to stop alcohol from activating it and causing intoxication,"" Pierce-Shimomura said. If the scientists could find a drug that has the same effect as the mutation, they might be able to help people overcome addiction and the effects of withdrawal.  Of course, any drug of this nature is a long way off from human trials. And even if they do find such a drug, it probably wouldn't get rid of all the symptoms of intoxication, because alcohol acts on multiple targets in the human brain. Still, Pierce-Shimomura said, alcoholism ""is a huge problem in society that needs more effort and funding. Almost everyone knows someone touched by alcohol abuse,"" so this is a path worth investigating further.",0.554213308389685,0.44578669161031503,0.8535613864460192,578,5.1730103806228378,310,6.2516129032258068,0,0,Science,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

A summary of the results, published today ahead of a House Energy and Commerce Committee meeting, elaborates on a similar report by the CDC, which found that one of its facilities failed to sterilize samples before sending them to a lower-security lab. In today's meeting, the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations will attempt to determine whether this and other security breaches were an established pattern at the CDC, and whether Congress or the USDA should take further action to make sure they don't happen again. According to this and previous reports, in early June, researchers at its Bioterrorism Rapid Response and Advanced Technology facility attempted to sterilize samples so that they could be safely studied in lower-security conditions. But the lab lacked a standard operating procedure and declared the samples safe prematurely. The new report also found a worrying lack of security both before and after the contamination was discovered. ""Anthrax was stored in unlocked refrigerators in an unrestricted hallway, and workers freely passed through the area at the time of inspection. Signs were not even placed on the refrigerators to prevent their being opened. Where a sign did note use of inactive anthrax, it did not prohibit entry. The key to one of the refrigerator doors sat in its lock. At the time of inspection, containers of anthrax were missing and had to be tracked and located by the inspection team. Anthrax still was sitting in an unregistered and unlocked lab and other areas that had not been registered for special agent use or storage."" ""Researchers could not remember if they used expired bleach."" The USDA also criticized the CDC's equipment. ""Disinfectant used for decontamination of vials and bags was expired, and researchers could not remember if they used expired bleach to decontaminate areas after the potential release was identified,"" reads one section. ""Lab workers had not been trained to decontaminate all relevant areas or properly use decontaminants."" The inspection found that unidentified ""select agent materials"" — ""select agents"" referring to dangerous pathogens — were ""transferred within two plastic Ziploc bags between labs, which did not meet the 'durable' requirement for secondary containment."" After the incident, it says, reports were ""inaccurate, inconsistent, and incomplete."" The CDC reportedly misidentified the number of potentially contaminated specimens, while poor communication made it unclear who was leading the decontamination process and gave conflicting signals. Some supervisors of exposed employees ""were advised that their staff should self-monitor rather than visit the clinic,"" and though the facility was decontaminated, ""CDC employees were told they were not in danger."" At this point, no employees are believed to have been infected after exposure. ""I want to emphasize how seriously we have taken these incidents."" The anthrax case is only one of a handful of worrying incidents revealed over the past month. While investigating the exposure, the agency discovered that a set of bird flu samples had been cross-contaminated, leading to the temporary closure of the influenza lab and a freeze on transferring biological materials. More worryingly, high-level staff remained unaware of the contamination for months. Earlier in July, vials of viable smallpox were found in an FDA lab. The USDA report notes that other agencies, including the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General, previously warned that some labs did not adequately vet potential employees or maintain a complete inventory of dangerous materials. In its own report, the CDC described four previous cases in which live anthrax and other dangerous materials were accidentally shipped from its laboratories. ""A potential live anthrax exposure raises serious questions about CDC's adherence to safety protocol measures and the agency's ability to ensure its scientists and the public are safe,"" said subcommittee head Rep. Tim Murphy (R-PA). CDC director Thomas Frieden, a witness at the hearing, defended the program in testimony, saying that the agency is ""uniquely capable"" of rapidly identifying and evaluating deadly biological agents that are rarely seen by ordinary clinicians and researchers. Nonetheless, he says the incident ""revealed troubling breaches of protocol, gaps in our review systems, and errors in judgment,"" calling it ""unacceptable."" Frieden has previously announced a series of steps forward, including creating an advisory board and a central point of accountability for lab safety. ""I want to emphasize how seriously we have taken these incidents,"" he says.

Crews have developed an extensive language of hand signals to express their needs, but they're hampered by one obvious caveat: the signals rely on people looking at each other. A flat hand making a cutting motion at a throat to indicate ""I'm running out of air"" is no good if your dive partner is distracted by a shoal of fish. Such challenges help explain why suffocation is the leading cause of diving fatalities, alongside being trapped in underwater caves or wrecks and equipment defects.  But improving underwater communication is hard. Electromagnetic waves, used in surface communication networks almost exclusively, fade out over long ranges in salt water, meaning that sound waves need to be used for data transmission instead. Hydrophones, essentially microphones designed to be used underwater, were developed in the early 20th century by noted physicist Ernest Rutherford to communicate with submarines, and both the US and Russian Navy have hydrophones installed in seabeds, connected by cable to land stations. But sound waves have very limited bandwidth, which means low data transfer rates compared to terrestrial communication. Ultrasonic, subaquatic networks All of which means that recreational divers don't have much in the way of foolproof communication. Now, a Swedish startup called Aqwary hopes to change that. The company has developed a new approach to underwater communication: allowing divers to create ultrasonic, subaquatic networks that passively share information like their location and air supply status. ""It allows you to be more alert about what's happening around you,"" explains Anders Brodin, the company's founder and managing director, in an interview with The Verge. He came up with the concept while diving with his kids and worrying about the state of their air supply. ""I realized that there has to be a technical solution that could help me do this,"" he says. The result is the Smart Console, a palm-sized unit with a 3.7-inch OLED display that connects to your air tank with a thick rubber tube. ""It's basically a small computer designed to withstand 50 meters [164 feet] of depth,"" Brodin says. ""It's integrated with your air supply, so you see how much gas you have left in your tank, and it also has all kinds of sensors."" Those include a magnetometer, accelerometer, external temperature sensor, depth meter, and air pressure (to measure the amount of breathing gas left in the tank), internal pressure, and internal temperature sensors. But the most notable feature of the Smart Console is that it also communicates with any other unit nearby through four ultrasonic hydrophones. On its screen, you see the name, position, depth, temperature, and air supply status of up to 70 other divers within 328 feet. If any run low on air, an alert is sent over the network and to a boat on the surface. If they get trapped underwater, they can broadcast a distress signal manually.   A mockup of the Smart Console. (Aqwary) Each diver's signals are sent over ultrasound. ""If you're old enough to remember the old-fashioned modems you used on your telephone line, it's pretty much the same basic technology,"" Brodin says. Those sound waves are modulated, sent through water, and then demodulated by another unit. This type of underwater communication has a theoretical range of around 3.7 miles, but the Smart Console has a shorter range of just 328 feet. The reason is battery life — ""We have designed it so you can get 10 hours of usage out of the unit,"" says Brodin. Save your dive data to the cloud But battery life isn't the only concern when you're blaring out high-pitched noises across the sea floor. Many marine creatures, dolphins included, use ultrasound to communicate and locate prey, and there are fears that noise pollution associated with human activity underwater is disrupting marine life. Brodin says they've seen no evidence of any adverse effects on animals from the Smart Console: ""When we did the first trials in early 2013, we spent time trying to annoy fishes at the reefs with it, and they didn't react at all. You could almost poke it at them and they wouldn't react."" Underneath the rather utilitarian waterproof exterior, the Smart Console has 32GB of memory, a 536MHz processor, and built-in Wi-Fi to save your dive data to the cloud. It's also equipped with an app store, where divers can download digital compasses, more advanced dive computers, and dictionaries of fish and dive sites. Unfortunately, it's not open to third-party developers because the device is ""classified as personal protective equipment,"" Brodin says. ""That means we have to be careful that we don't get code in there that would somehow risk people's lives."" ""They asked us if we could play movies or show Netflix on it."" The apps available were chosen by beta testers, and one of the biggest requests from users was something to do during decompression. When you dive deep, you have to stop on the way up for 15 to 20 minutes to avoid decompression sickness, commonly known as ""the bends."" ""Right now one of the developers is working on a version of Snake,"" Brodin says. ""They asked us if we could play movies or show Netflix on it, but unfortunately we don't have the bandwidth."" Nor can you tweet from the bottom of the sea just yet — the devices can't connect to the wider web from below the waves. But that may change, Brodin says. ""That's actually in the makings for something we will launch in a year from now."" The company will ship its first orders in July, with the unit running around $800 USD. Ultimately, Brodin hopes that the Smart Console makes diving safer. ""Having full access to your buddies' data will support your decisions during the dive to make sure that you keep within limits,"" he says. With studies showing that diving is 40 to 60 times more dangerous than driving a car, perhaps the Smart Console will make the sea a safer place to be for those who want to experience its beauty first-hand.",0.3388408850140703,0.6611591149859297,0.20590245332571525,1036,4.9449806949806954,564,6.1010638297872344,0,0,"Science, Report",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Like someone stapled feathers onto an overweight lizard Unearthed in China, C. yangi looks slightly less elegant now — like someone stapled feathers onto an overweight lizard — but the 125-million-year-old fossil can provide some clues into the evolution of flight, according to a paper on the animal published in Nature Communications. C. yangi likely used its hind wings for pitch control, according to the paper, letting it slow down to prepare for a landing. Although feathered dinosaurs have been turning up since 1996 — frequently, like this one, in what's now China's Liaoning province — C. yangi is the largest four-winged dinosaur discovered yet. Researchers assumed a small body was required for flight, but C. yangi, four times as heavy as many of it cousins, expands that definition.

In a statement released last week, Sage Publications said that it had uncovered a series of papers published in the Journal of Vibration and Control between 2010 and 2014 that had been sent to be peer reviewed by people using false identities. Sage believes that the ring is centered on the work of Peter Chen, from the National Pingtung University of Education, and potentially others from his university.  Chen resigned his position amid the investigation In a statement to Retraction Watch, Sage explains that it uncovered at least 130 email accounts used to circumvent its system of peer review. Journals of high repute require that scientific papers are reviewed for consistency by a separate group of researchers working in a relevant field before publication. Traditionally, who is reviewing a paper is kept anonymous, but Vox points out that some smaller journals will accept suggestions on who should review a paper in cases where a field is tiny enough that it may be difficult to find someone properly qualified. That's seemingly what happened here, with Chen and possibly others alleged to have created fake email addresses for reviewers — at least one of which was found to be Chen himself. Though the papers weren't all authored by Chen, Vox notes that those papers may still have have cited Chen's work, boosting his profile. Chen resigned from his position at the National Pingtung University of Education in February, in the middle of the 14-month-long investigation. The editor-in-chief of the Journal of Vibration and Control also resigned his position in May. Altogether, it sounds as though the journal was sloppy in its vetting of reviewers, and Sage says that it will ""continue to introduce new measures"" to protect the peer-review process. Retractions because of fraud and unethical conduct are uncommon as a whole, but they're a notable tarnish when they occur. Last year, an investigation into open-access journals found that more than 100 of them were willing to accept and publish a completely bogus paper. More than anything, it appears to be that select journals are not ensuring that papers go through a robust process of peer review — intentionally or otherwise — leading to these mishaps.",0.26610792722865834,0.7338920727713416,0.8276326567062506,393,5.10941475826972,227,6.2158590308370041,0,0,Science,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I picked Major Lazer, Miguel, and the rather obscure Lijadu Sisters. In return I got five very short playlists, a couple with just five songs each. The track selection was right on the money, if a little obvious.

History is a great lens for music discovery I've always thought that a historical approach to music discovery and curation was a neglected one. Before Spotify came along, one of my favorite tricks for finding new music, besides recommendations from friends, was to take one artist I liked and research them on a service like AllMusic.com. From there I would track down influences from the past and acts that followed in the footsteps of the bands I already knew and enjoyed. Spotify killed off its selection of third-party apps, which makes me sad. I understand why; most were rarely updated and many felt stale or broken. But I got a lot out of the ones created by BlueNote and Def Jam, which let you browse through the catalog with a chronological bent. I would love a feature that lets you start a radio station but then limits the following tracks by decade or year. Hopefully one of many new Spotify apps Hopefully Rewind moves beyond an unannounced web plaything and gets incorporated into Spotify's desktop and mobile apps with even more granular options.

The first indications of the new deal between the companies came last week after App.net founder Bryan Berg observed more direct routes for Netflix data through Comcast's network. The Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday night that the change was the result of a formal, paid agreement between the two companies, but Comcast does not specify how much the deal is worth. ""How come Time Warner is showing solid Netflix performance with no paid peering?"" The result comes after a number of troubling moves by Comcast, which had seen Netflix speeds plummet on the network, as reflected in the service's monthly ISP rankings. Comcast has sworn it isn't throttling Netflix traffic, but the simple fact is that Netflix traffic has grown increasingly difficult to deliver onto Comcast's network, while other ISPs see little degradation. As analyst Rich Greenfield put it, ""How come Time Warner is showing solid Netflix performance without paid peering?"" One answer is that Netflix's data-delivery service, Cogent, has faced increasing difficulty in moving all of Netflix's traffic through the existing Comcast connections, a problem it does not have with smaller providers like Time Warner. At the same time, providers like Cablevision have solved the problem by signing up for Netflix's Open Connect service, which offers direct access for free. It's good news for Cablevision customers, who see faster download times, but it also means the Cablevision network has to bear a larger data load. Comcast and Verizon have publicly refused to sign up for Open Connect. After this latest deal, it seems as if the central issue is payment, effectively holding Netflix subscribers on their network hostage unless the service agrees to pay for a better connection. Update: this story was revised with additional information from Comcast's statement.
